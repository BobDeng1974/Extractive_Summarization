@entity0 admits the @entity1 may be too big a mountain for him to climb			2
the 2015 route was unveiled in @entity4 on wednesday and @entity0 said : ‘ next year ’s @entity5 is going to be about the mountains			1
there ’s very little emphasis on time - trialling which means the race will be decided up in the high mountains			2
‘ with six mountain - top finishes it is going to be an aggressive and massively demanding race			0
rather than chase a second yellow jersey on the @entity28 , which starts in @entity29 on july 4 and finishes in @entity4 on july 26 , @entity0 may instead focus on may ’s @entity16 and august ’s @entity30			1
@entity0 was not in @entity4 on wednesday , instead he was sailing in @entity31 with the @entity33 sailing squad on a @entity35 training camp			1
on seeing the route he made a statement on his website , saying : ‘ the team and i will have to give it some careful consideration before we make any commitments to which of the grand tours i will compete in			0
@entity0 , riding for @entity35 , in action during stage 16 of the @entity47 @entity48 announced for the 2015 @entity16 ‘ i see myself as quite a balanced gc ( general classification ) rider and the @entity16 with its inclusion of a long @entity53 ( time - trial ) of 60km and tough uphill finishes will make it a well - balanced race which suits me			1
if i did the @entity16 i may also be able to get myself back in shape for the @entity30 and go there with a realistic chance			0
’ it was anticipated the @entity28 would be a vintage edition , with @entity0 , @entity24 , two - time winner @entity62 and @entity16 winner @entity63 all chasing the yellow jersey			2
the probable absence of @entity0 , twice runner - up in the @entity30 — including behind @entity62 in 2014 — would take the gloss off the race			1
but he added : ‘ in the past i ’ve only targeted one grand tour each season , but it could be a good opportunity for me to focus seriously on two			0
’ @entity33 cyclist @entity72 attends the @entity21 @entity73 in @entity4 after leaving @entity29 the @entity1 travels through @entity74 to northern @entity75			0
next is a transfer to the @entity77 and a traverse across the @entity79 , with the decisive moments taking place in the @entity82			0
there are nine flat stages — good for sprinters like @entity72			0
the @entity87 rider was in @entity4 on wednesday and tweeted : ‘ great route next year ! going to be some exhausted legs , but a good few stages for @ opqscyclingteam ’ .			1

the 29 - year - old @entity94 - born @entity93 won the 2013 tour and crashed out of this year *'s* race
