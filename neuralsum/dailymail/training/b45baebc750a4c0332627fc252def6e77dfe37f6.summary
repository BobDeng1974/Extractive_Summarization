the man who became the first person in the @entity2 to have a successful hand transplant says he now is on the way to being ' 75 per cent recovered '			1
@entity5 , 53 , made history when he had the operation on boxing day 2012 at the @entity8			1
the father - of - one , from @entity10 , @entity11 , had lost the use of his right hand – and some from his left – when it became infected during a severe attack of gout , a condition he had suffered for 20 years			1
@entity5 , 53 , made history when he had the @entity2 's first hand transplant			1
now , nearly two years on , is is able to pick up his new granddaughter , @entity21 , just seven months old , and eat food without having it cut up for him mr @entity5 says he is now on the way to being ' 75 per cent recovered ' - and hopes to drive a manual car again surgery to cut the infection out had left him with a paralysed hand - and he had been forced to give up his job as a pub landlord			1
as his condition deteriorated , it became virtually impossible to do anything			0
' my wife had to help me dress and cut my food up			1
you can imagine without any hands it 's very difficult , ' he said			0
the operation , painstakingly performed by a team led by plastic surgeon professor @entity41 , was a success - and ' transformed ' mr @entity5 's life			1
his operation became a world first when his original hand was removed in the same procedure			1
while there have been other hand transplants worldwide , in those cases recipients had already lost the limb before the surgery			1
now , nearly two years on , mr @entity5 has been able to hold his grandson 's hand again , tuck into a juicy steak and now pick up his new granddaughter , @entity21 , just seven months old			1
mr @entity5 said the last two years had been like a rollercoaster ride , particularly after suffering a rejection scare just three days after the operation and a screw coming off after three months			1
the former pub landlord had lost the use of his right hand – and some from his left – when it became infected during a severe attack of gout , a condition he had suffered for 20 years surgery to cut the infection out had left him with a paralysed hand - and he had been forced to give up his job as a pub landlord			1
two years ago , he had the ' bad ' hand removed and a new one transplanted ( above ) the process of rehabilitation is long - and it can take years for the nerves to come back			1
he said : ' i am definitely over 50 per cent better and heading to 75 per cent , though i will never get the feeling back completely			1
' i do n't have to rely on my wife so much now			2
i can wash myself in the bath , whereas i could only wash half of my body before			2
' i also can pick my grandchildren up , which is a marvellous feeling			0
' before the operation , for all of his grandson @entity84 's life , mr @entity5 had to settle for ' just observing ' the little boy , rather than be able to play with him			1
since the op , the two have been able to hold hands			2
and despite being naturally left - handed , he can now hold a steering wheel with his transplanted hand - and says he may eventually go back to driving a manual car			2
he added : ' i can open tins and tie my own tie , use a mobile phone			0
shoelaces i can do just about , though they are not easy			0
' the operation , painstakingly performed by a team led by plastic surgeon professor @entity41 , at @entity8 , was a success - and ' transformed ' mr @entity5 's life ' even better , i can hold a knife and fork properly and tuck into a nice steak in a restaurant without having to have my food cut up first			1
' mr @entity5 , who has one daughter , @entity104 , is full of gratitude to the family of the donor			2
his wife @entity108 added : ' it was a wonderful thing to do			2
it must have been really difficult for them but i 'll always be grateful for the choice they made			2
' mr @entity5 had been unable to use his right hand for five years after it became infected owing to severe gout , an acute form of arthritis caused by a build - up of uric acid in the blood			1
he and @entity108 were forced to give up their beloved village pub , the @entity124 in @entity10 , near @entity125 , because of his disability			0
mr @entity5 , a former rugby league player , was also left wheelchair - bound at one point when the gout affected his spine			1
however in late 2011 , the @entity130 trust announced it was starting to look for potential candidates for hand or arm transplants			0
before having the op , his mobility had become so bad that wife @entity136 ( pictured ) had to help him dress anhd cut up his food			1
' you can imagine without any hands it 's very difficult , ' he said an @entity8 team had been preparing and assessing potential recipients from across the country			0
mr @entity5 was part of the programme and had to undergo a series of health checks , as well as psychological assessments to ensure potential patients had properly considered the implications of the procedure			2
hand transplants have already been carried out by doctors in the @entity155 , @entity156 and @entity157 leading the way for other transplant operations of such organs as the face , abdominal wall or larynx			0
the first major organ to be transplanted successfully was a cornea , by @entity166 in @entity167 , @entity168 in 1905 , but not until nearly 50 years later , in 1954 , did doctors in @entity170 successfully transplant a kidney			2
the first successful heart transplant was by dr @entity173 in @entity174 , @entity175 , in 1967 , and was followed by the first heart and liver transplants in the @entity2 the following year			0
not until 1983 did @entity2 see the first combined heart and lung transplant			0
in 2005 , the first partial face transplant was carried out , in @entity181 , @entity157 where @entity182 , a 38 - year - old woman who had been mauled by her dog , was given a new nose , chin and lips			0
five years later the first full face transplant was carried out , in @entity188 , @entity189 , on a farmer known only as @entity191 who had been injured in a shooting accident			0
he received the entire facial skin and muscles - including cheekbones , nose , lips and teeth - of a donor			0
in october 2006 , surgeon @entity201 at @entity203 's @entity202 was given permission by the @entity206 ethics board to carry out a face transplant			0
his team will select four adult patients for operations			0
accurate restoration of nerve structures was one thing , but there were a multitude of factors to accommodate in the aftermath including regular physiotherapy , hand exercises and occupational therapy as well as adjusting to a lifetime of taking immuno - suppressant drugs			0
but mr @entity5 said : ' anything i have now is better than what i had before this operation			1
i 'm hoping to eventually get back to work – i 'm already moving my fingers and the doctors say i 'm making quicker progress than they expected			0
' he added he shocked when he was offered the ground - breaking surgery less than three months after he was added to the transplant register			0
' after a lot of tests , professor @entity234 ( the plastic surgeon who performed the operation ) told me i could be a candidate for a hand transplant , and asked me to give it some thought			2
when doctors learned that a hand suitable for transplant had become available they called in mr @entity5 for tests to check how his tissue matched with that of the donor			1
he said : ' i was called into the hospital along with another recipient , and they tested us to see which was the stronger match – and i was			0
' within hours the doctors began the gruelling surgery , which saw his hand removed and the replacement attached in the same operation			1
mr @entity5 added : ' it did n't feel real until i woke up after the operation			2
it felt like a dream , even when i was going into theatre			0
' he added : ' it 's how i expected it to look , because i 've done a lot of research about hand transplants			0
' but you can do all the research you want and you do n't know how you 're going to feel – i 've had a lot of help from psychologists because the biggest thing is afterwards , whether i would accept it as mine			0

@entity5 , 53 , made history when he had the operation in *december* 2012
lost the use of his right when it became infected during severe gout attack
surgery to cut out the infection had left him with paralysed hand
first person to have ' old ' hand removed and new one attached in one op
means he can now wash himself and no longer relies on wife cutting up food
two years on , he is ' between 50 and 75 *%* per cent recovered ' from surgery
