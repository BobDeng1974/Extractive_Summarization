after overlooking @entity2 ’s trip to @entity3 on saturday evening , @entity0 used the same betting strategy as every other coach in the club ’s recent history			1
play it straight , put all your worldly possessions on @entity3 ’s @entity11 and cash in at the end of the night			2
from these positions , the last throw of the dice , @entity2 used to be as safe as houses			0
@entity3 wizard @entity2 dances past @entity19 defender @entity18 at the @entity20 @entity3 ace @entity2 leaves @entity19 defender @entity21 on the floor at the @entity20 instead , the @entity3 forward skulked off at the final whistle , looking like a man who had done all his money after failing to convert a 90th - minute penalty			1
the little man was distraught			0
@entity2 has missed five of his last 10 from the spot for @entity3 and @entity30 , a worrying trend for someone who many still regard as the world ’s best footballer			1
to be fair to him , he played like it			0
by the time @entity37 brought him down in the final minute , @entity2 ’s work for the night had already been done			0
he had wreaked havoc , given the run of the place by @entity19 ’s benevolent defence as @entity43 put @entity3 into a commanding first - leg lead			1
the only thing missing from this bravura @entity2 performance was the name of the @entity11 on the huge television screens hanging off the stands at the @entity20			1
with 37 goals already this season , including eight in the @entity53 , it would take a brave man to back against him from 12 yards out			0
last year , he opened the scoring here from the spot in the 54th minute			0
@entity2 skips past fellow @entity58 international @entity37 as the defender stalks the tiny terror @entity43 , @entity2 and @entity61 celebrate at the @entity20 as they turn the style on against @entity19 the only thing missing from this bravura @entity2 performance was the name of the @entity11 on the huge television screens hanging off the stands at the @entity20			1
with 37 goals already this season , including eight in the @entity53 , it would take a brave man to back against him from 12 yards out			0
last year , he opened the scoring here from the spot in the 54th minute			0
this time @entity70 denied him , saving brilliantly as @entity2 went straight and getting up in time to witness the forward tamely head the rebound wide of the post			0
@entity19 goalkeeper @entity70 can only look on as @entity74 ace @entity43 finds the corner of the goal the @entity19 players collapse in despair as @entity43 puts the ball neatly past @entity81 number on @entity70 this time @entity70 denied him , saving brilliantly as @entity2 went straight and getting up in time to witness the forward tamely head the rebound wide of the post			1
‘ it was an important save and 3 - 1 would have been a difficult score for us to progress because it was a very unnecessary , emotional foul , ’ admitted @entity19 ’s manager @entity84			2
these spot - kicks are playing on @entity2 , gnawing away at this little genius after his failure to put away his penalty in the @entity92 against @entity93 last month			1
on that occasion , he scored the rebound			0
a third @entity3 goal would surely have finished this tie , putting it beyond the reach of @entity19 in the second leg on march 18			1
at 2 - 1 , it still feels like there is far much for @entity84 ’s team to do			0
@entity2 shows @entity19 captain @entity18 a clean pair of heels as the @entity58 progresses even those connected to the @entity20 concede that , penalty apart , this was a breathtaking performance by the three - time world player of the year			1
the set up for @entity43 ’s second goal was agonising for @entity19 as he drew four defenders towards him and then twisted his way through them			1
sir @entity113 , watching from the stands , would have appreciated that moment more than most			0
when @entity2 finally released the ball into the path of left - back @entity119 , his cross found the onrushing figure of @entity43 to meet it from close range			1
@entity3 ’s no 9 scored it , @entity2 made it			1
at times he was mouth - watering , particularly when he raised that left boot into the night sky to pull down a bizarre up and under from @entity43 inside the area			2
@entity70 helps @entity2 to his feet after the @entity58 attacker had been thwarted by the @entity81 international do you applaud a skill like that , accept it comes naturally to this gifted forward , or try to work out how the hell anyone will ever be able to stop him ? possibly all three			2
here , @entity21 , the man you would loosely describe as @entity2 ’s marker , was sent off for a second booking and will miss the second leg in the @entity140			2
@entity21 will not forget this night in a long while			0
incredibly the left back ’s two cautions had nothing to do with @entity2 and he was sent off in the 74th minute for a foul on @entity146			0
by then , he had been shredded by @entity2			0
@entity2 is left stunned with his head in his hands as he misses a penalty to give @entity3 a two goal advantage @entity2 tricks himself past a trio of sky blue shirts as he looks to attack @entity70 in the @entity19 goal @entity70 looks on as the former @entity157 ace is able to celebrate against former rivals @entity19 this was also a bad night for @entity19 ’s captain @entity18 after he headed down into the path of @entity43 to open the scoring in the 16th minute			1
no - one knows if @entity18 is any good any more , or whether this @entity19 defence is just to bad at the highest level of the @entity167 game that he keeps being @entity169 way he escaped when he brought down @entity2 as he made his way into the area , with @entity173 referee @entity172 giving him the benefit of the doubt			1
it is incredible that @entity84 made no special plans to contain one of the best players we have witnessed			0
@entity2 ’s intelligence is remarkable , working it all out tactically in his head in the opening five minutes and instructing @entity43 to switch positions			2
@entity2 had the @entity19 defence worked out			1
after @entity185 ’s 69th - minute strike , @entity19 travel to the @entity140 for the second leg believing they can get back into this tie			2
their only hope now is to put @entity2 back on the spot			0
@entity2 does well to hold off the challenge of former @entity192 defender @entity21 at the @entity20 on tuesday			2

@entity2 was at his stunning best as @entity3 beat @entity19
@entity58 set up former @entity157 striker @entity43 for his second
the *27* - year - old ran rings around the @entity19 defence at the @entity20
only a late penalty miss *threatened* to ruin his magical performance
