@entity0 has revealed one police officer in @entity2 used stop and search 54 times , almost entirely against young black men , but made no arrests police stop - and - search powers are often blamed for causing racial tensions in communities , but now the true scale of the problem has been laid bare			1
in @entity2 , one police officer used stop - and - search powers 54 times in just six months , almost entirely on black men aged between 10 and 19 , but did n't find enough evidence to make a single arrest			1
a second officer with the @entity19 used the same powers 33 times , with 29 stops targeting young black men , but again none of the searches lead to an arrest			2
nine officers with the @entity2 force were responsible for 312 searches between them , but again failed to arrest anyone , figures released under @entity32 laws to @entity34 show			2
of those 312 searches , almost half were on young black men , while another 44 per cent were on black or ethnic minority @entity37			0
the figures seem to suggest that a small but persistent number of officers are using stop - and - search legislation to disproportionately target ethnic minorities			2
nationally black and ethnic minority members of the public are up to six times more likely to be searched than white people			0
the data was revealed after home secretary @entity48 launched an overhaul of the controversial powers this week			1
across the @entity52 35 police forces have opted in to the voluntary code of conduct with immediate effect , with the remaining eight phasing it in over the coming months			0
the new system means that officers must have a specific reason for searching an individual , whereas under the previous system police only needed ' reasonable suspicion ' that a crime had taken place forces will also have to record the outcomes of all stop and searches , and reveal whether the ground for the arrest and the reason for the search are linked			1
the aim is to drive down the use of stop - and - search powers , which are seen by detractors are largely ineffective			0
nine police officers were responsible for 312 uses of stop and search powers in just six months , but none of them made a single arrest			1
almost half of those stopped were black ( file image ) @entity85 , @entity86 mp for @entity87 , told @entity88 : ' there is not a black family in @entity2 who can not tell you of these stories happening to them or someone they know			0
' i give credit to @entity48 for being the first minister in 20 years to tackle the problem of stop and search powers			1
' stop and search has long been accused of causing racial tensions in communities , especially in @entity2 where they were one of the main catalysts for the 1981 @entity106 race riots			0
as part of @entity109 81 , around 1,000 people were stopped and searched in @entity106 in just five days , with just 82 arrests made .			0

nine officers carried out 312 stops without making one arrest , data shows
@entity0 revealed as @entity48 launches overhaul of controversial powers
police can no longer use age , race , or *religion* as grounds for a search
