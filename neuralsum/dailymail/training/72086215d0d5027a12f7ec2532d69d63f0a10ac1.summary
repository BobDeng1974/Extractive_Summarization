by @entity0 published : 07:19 est , 5 august 2013 updated : 07:19 est , 5 august 2013 @entity1 may be able to carry off the tightest of briefs , but it appears the women of @entity6 do n't want their partners to follow his sartorial example			1
a new survey shows that a whopping 89 per cent of women favour pants with a bit more coverage , with only 11 per cent preferring their men in @entity1 - style ' budgie - smugglers '			1
sadly , not all men look like @entity1 when wearing tiny briefs eighty - nine per cent of women preferred the boxers modelled by @entity20 from @entity21 ( right ) to briefs like those on model @entity23 ( left ) model @entity23 and @entity21 cast - member @entity20 showcased the different styles at a photoshoot for @entity28			1
@entity1 stepped up to sport the briefs , while @entity20 represented ‘ @entity30 ’			2
the pair tried on three styles each from well - known @entity33 and designer names , including @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity1 for @entity37 , and the @entity39 ’s very own @entity38			0
women around the country were then asked to vote for their favourite look on @entity43 , @entity44 and the @entity28 website , with boxers emerging as the clear winner in each of the three rounds of the competition			0
the pair modelled boxers and briefs in a variety of styles and brands for @entity28 and it appears the models sided with the ladies			2
@entity20 said : ‘ i like boxers although they probably look better on @entity1 than on me ! ’ but it 's not time to dig out those saggy , dad - style numbers			1
we 're in agreement with @entity65 - who is launching @entity67 this december - who says : ‘ i prefer boxers but not those big baggy things , more a good pair of @entity36 ’s			0
’ so there you have it : invest in a nice pair of trunks if you want to please the woman in your life			0
or , if you 're @entity1 , stick to the tiniest pants possible .			0

eighty - nine per cent of women prefer boxers over briefs for their man
this despite @entity1 being *ambassador* for tiny pants
