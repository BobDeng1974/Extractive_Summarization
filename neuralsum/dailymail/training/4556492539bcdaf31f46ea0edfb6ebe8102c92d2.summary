despite being just five years old - @entity1 has displayed more bravery in the face of adversity than most adults will in a lifetime			1
the young girl , who had cancer , sent a deeply moving message to other sick children - telling them : ' if you have cancer do n't worry - i am brave and you can be brave also			1
' with the help of her father @entity15 , the amazing young girl recorded a video talking people through her illness and the ordeal she has been through			0
she was diagnosed with bilateral @entity32 ' tumor , a form of kidney cancer , in february 2014 and treated at @entity35 in @entity36			1
she then underwent six months of chemotherapy , had radiation treatment to her lungs and has had four bouts of surgery to remove her left kidney and part of her right kidney			1
in the video she describes the tumour that was removed as a ' big meatball on her kidney '			0
she adds : ' chemo has medicine to kill the cells that are growing the tumour and the medicine keeps going to try and kill it			0
' this also damages the cells which grow my hair so all my hair fell out			0
' i had something called radiation also , which is pretty fun because you get to blow bubbles and i can bring my cd and sing along			0
' and you have these butterfly stickers they draw on you with permanent marker			0
' @entity69 is no fun but its a little bit fun because you get to go on this camp			0
' towards the end of the heartrending clip she explains that she is making the video to help others deal with cancer			2
she says : ' i want to be on tv and i want to be on the newspaper so people can see how brave i 've been during cancer			2
' if you have cancer do n't worry - i am brave and you can be brave also			1
' @entity1 finished her treatment on august 25 and has been told that there are no more signs of the disease			1
her mother @entity89 said : ' @entity1 is doing well , she finished her treatment and her end of treatment scans showed no evidence of disease			1
' she will be regularly monitored by @entity94 and @entity95 for the next five years			0
she started kindergarten this fall and is doing great ! ' below the @entity25 post , her father @entity15 wrote : ' throughout her ordeal , she has always been very matter a fact about the entire situation			0
' she understands what 's going on and knows what 's needed to fix it			0
' she approached us one day and said she wanted to do a " commercial " to explain to other kids what they can expect when going through cancer and show them " how brave " she has been			1
# teamhannah ' the @entity25 video has already been viewed by thousands of people with many praising @entity1 for her bravery on @entity113			2
one user , @entity114 , tweeted : ' so much bravery and hope in a little soul ! really motivating and emotional			0
' another wrote : ' this adorable five - year - old wanted to make her own commercial			1
she 's brave and i love her			2
