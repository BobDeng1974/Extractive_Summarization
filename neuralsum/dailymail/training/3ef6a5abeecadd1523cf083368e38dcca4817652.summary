@entity0 and @entity1 knew when they started a family they would be making an inevitable contribution to multicultural @entity6			1
what they did n’t expect was that they ’d start their own melting pot. for the children produced by the blue - eyed blonde and her black - skinned husband cover just about every spectrum of the inter-racial rainbow			1
melting pot : @entity1 and @entity17 with , from left , @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22 or , as @entity1 proudly describes it : ‘ we ’re like a box of chocolates – dark ones , brown ones and white ones			1
’ the couple ’s remarkable brood includes a daughter who shares mum ’s fair skin and eye colour ; her golden complexioned sister ; their olive - skinned big brother ; and the latest arrival , a button - nosed , black baby boy who looks just like dad			1
precisely how they ended up with four such different children is doubtless of great interest to geneticists , but it came as a surprise to @entity0 , a former model , and @entity1 , a store supervisor			1
at one stage they even wondered whether daughter @entity20 , the palest on the @entity54 colour chart , might have been switched at birth with another child at @entity57			1
yet the couple ’s attitude to rainbow family life is refreshingly black and white			1
‘ we could n’t care less what colour they are , ’ said @entity0 , 24			1
‘ they are a great joy to us and we could n’t be happier			2
’ dark - skinned @entity22 ( left ) is just like his father while @entity20 ( right ) has taken after her mother after their first child , @entity19 , now six , was born at @entity72 in @entity73 , @entity0 and @entity1 , from @entity57 , watched him develop into a perfect blend of his parents – with olive skin , blue eyes , and soft , curly brown hair			1
@entity21 , now four , was born at the same hospital and looked almost identical to her big brother as a baby , but is growing up with slightly paler skin and lighter hair			2
‘ when she was born we only got a quick glimpse of her because her blood sugar level was so low , and she was whisked away for treatment before a wristband could be put on her , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ when she came back an hour or so later , and i got a proper look at her , i could n’t believe how white she was			2
‘ i said to @entity1 : “ do you think they ’ve given us the wrong baby ? ” @entity1 never for one moment thought i ’d cheated on him			1
he was my first boyfriend , we ’re happily married and there was never any doubt about that			2
' it 's so nice having children who are all a bit different			1
they are all gorgeous and we love them all the same ' , said @entity17 ‘ the question was : was she switched ? we knew it was unlikely but you do hear about it			0
‘ people kept coming up to me in the street asking if my children had different fathers			2
i ’d never ask anyone that , but people were very blatant			0
’ to rule out any doubt about a hospital mix - up , the couple agreed to a dna test			0
it proved @entity20 was 100 per cent @entity122			0
but baby @entity22 was about to make the mix even more diverse			0
he was born a year ago with dark skin , black curly hair and brown eyes			0
‘ when we first saw him , @entity1 nearly fell over , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ he took one look at him in the delivery room and said : “ @entity137 , he ’s black ! ” the midwife just stared at him in astonishment and said : “ you do know you ’re a black man , do n’t you ? ” ‘ we were laughing and @entity1 said : “ you do n’t understand – i have one child who is completely white ! ”			1
’ @entity1 , 33 , was born in @entity6 two years after his parents emigrated from @entity140 , @entity141			1
@entity0 said : ‘ @entity22 has got darker and is the only one with brown eyes			1
he has completely got @entity1 ’s genes , whereas @entity20 has got whiter			1
she has straight , blonde hair and light blue eyes			0
‘ it ’s so nice having children who are all a bit different			2
they are all gorgeous and we love them all the same			0
’ aside from an occasional raised eyebrow , the family has never encountered racism			0
‘ thankfully , most people are colour blind these days , ’ added @entity0			1
‘ our children are living proof of that			2
’ it is unusual for children with the same parents to have dramatically different skin colours , but – as the @entity17 family prove – it ’s far from impossible			2
several different genes control skin colour , in a similar way to eye and hair colour			0
each child gets half of their genes from each parent			0
a black person can possess one or two genes for lighter skin , while a white person may have some for darker skin			0
a child ’s skin colour will depend on which combination it inherits – and in siblings whose parents have both dark and light gene variants , the results can be dramatically different			0
@entity187 , a professor of genetic epidemiology at @entity189 , said : ‘ people think it is a black and white issue , but this case shows it clearly is n’t			0
although it is unusual , it happens perhaps more than people think			0
‘ there is no single gene that determines skin colour , but ten or so			0
it is luck which mixture a child gets			0
’ a spokesman for the @entity202 added : ‘ like many human traits , skin colour is influenced by several different genes			0
‘ if both parents have a combination of “ light skin ” and “ dark skin ” gene variants , then their children can have a skin colour anywhere in between , depending on which combination of variants they receive			2

@entity0 and @entity1 have four children that cover just about every spectrum of the inter-racial rainbow
they wondered at one point whether their palest daughter was really theirs
