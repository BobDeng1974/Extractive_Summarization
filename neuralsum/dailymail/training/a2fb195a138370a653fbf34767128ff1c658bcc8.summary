the @entity3 militant ' @entity2 ' was chosen to execute @entity5 @entity4 and @entity6 because it would make other @entity8 feel part of @entity11 cause , a fighter who defected from the group has said			1
the former insurgent , in his 20s and now based in @entity14 , said @entity2 helped to showcase @entity11 to @entity16 recruits			0
he said : ' it is possible that the goal was to project the image that a @entity20 or a @entity16 person executed an @entity5 so that they can showcase their @entity16 members and appeal to others outside @entity24 and make them feel that they belong to the same cause and that they too can do anything in support of @entity11 in their respective countries			2
he also said that the terrorist , known as @entity37 , believed to be responsible for the murder of the two @entity5 journalists , will face justice ' one way or another '			0
the fanatic , who has a multicultural @entity45 accent , killed mr @entity4 in a video released two weeks ago and mr @entity6 - like mr @entity4 a journalist - in a clip released earlier this week			0
the @entity11 defector told @entity50 the principle goal of the organisation was to establish an @entity54 state first in the @entity55 , and then extend it to the rest of the world			0
an @entity11 militant in @entity24 prepares to set fire to what appears to be a @entity3 passport he then throws it into the flames in a symbolic attempt to renounce his citizenship a former @entity11 fighter said western militants , such as those pictured , consider their home countries ' infidels ' he added that @entity16 recruits were especially valuable because they turn on their home countries and are willing to carry out attacks there			1
he added : ' since @entity16 fighters joined @entity11 they consider their home country as infidels			2
' if they have a chance they will carry out attacks because they consider it an infidel country and it should be fought			0
' it 's believed there are about 500 @entity3 currently enlisted within @entity11 ranks in @entity24 and @entity86 and the numbers are growing daily			1
to combat the threat they pose , @entity90 , the home secretary , raised the terror threat level from substantial to severe on friday and mr @entity31 has proposed laws barring its citizens returning to @entity3 if they are found to have joined @entity11 ' ranks			1

*ex-insurgent* *claims* ' @entity2 ' acted as killer for *promotional* purposes
a @entity115 killing an @entity5 would be a ' showcase ' to potential recruits
westerners who join @entity11 will try to ' carry out attacks ' in their *homeland*
it 's believed at least 500 @entity3 have joined @entity11 ranks in @entity86 and @entity24
*pm* @entity31 wants to remove home - grown fighters ' right to return
