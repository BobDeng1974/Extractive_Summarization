to some observers , it always seemed rather odd that @entity2 spent eight years and more than £ 150,000 of @entity4 taxpayers ’ money fighting extradition to @entity7			1
after all , the militant @entity9 preacher had been in a @entity4 prison — principally at @entity11 in @entity12 and , later , @entity13 in @entity14 — since may 2004			1
did it really make that much difference , swapping a jail cell in one hated infidel country for a jail cell in another ? but the former @entity21 nightclub bouncer — convicted in @entity4 of ‘ soliciting to murder ’ and inciting racial hatred — has always feared the @entity7 getting their hands on him			1
for years , the @entity36 - born preacher abused the hospitality of the country that gave him a home — quite literally , housing his large family in a smart @entity42 street , and supporting them with state benefits — by attacking its values and calling for its violent overthrow			1
but while the @entity4 government is deeply relieved to rid itself of him after years of embarrassment and exasperation , @entity7 officials have n’t been able to hide their delight at finally getting their hands on him			1
after the september 11 attacks destroyed the @entity57 , @entity2 crowed : ‘ many people will be happy , jumping up and down at this moment			2
’ today , that ’s a fair description of the @entity7 government ’s feelings on having him in its power			2
eleven years after @entity2 ’s hate - filled sermons inspired 9/11 plotter @entity66 ( and months later did the same for @entity42 @entity68 , who tried to bring down a @entity71 - bound @entity70 flight with a shoe bomb ) , he has arrived in a country that loathes him as much as he loathes it			1
the @entity75 summed up the prevailing mood : ‘ now he ’s all ours , ’ it said			2
@entity2 and the other three suspects extradited with him were ‘ at the nerve centres of @entity83 ’s terror networks and will finally face justice ’ , according to @entity79 , the @entity7 district attorney who will lead the prosecution			2
@entity85 , a local @entity7 congressman and chairman of the @entity87 , described @entity2 as ‘ obviously an arrogant b * * * * * d ’ and an ‘ evil person ’			2
in the @entity7 , 54 - year - old @entity2 faces 11 terrorism charges relating to three plots , among them the 1998 kidnapping in @entity95 of 16 tourists , including two @entity7 , in which three @entity4 and an @entity97 died			1
in cell : the @entity100 in @entity32 , @entity101 , where @entity2 is being held he is also accused of supporting the setting up of a terrorist training camp in @entity104 , and fomenting violent jihad in @entity106			1
he has pleaded not guilty , but faces a life sentence — and , in @entity7 , life is likely to mean life — if convicted			0
already , he has experienced the brutally no - nonsense approach of @entity7 law - enforcement : on arrival , his famous hooks were confiscated as a security risk , and last saturday he was forced to make a court appearance with the stumps of his arms protruding from the short sleeves of his navy blue jumpsuit			1
( @entity2 says he lost both hands and an eye in a landmine explosion during the war against the @entity124 in @entity106			0
) but this is just the start : he can expect no quarter from @entity7 authorities determined to make his life as uncomfortable as possible			0
at one stage , prison guards at the @entity32 jail — where breakfast is powdered egg , tinned tomatoes and toast — boasted that he was having to eat through a straw as none of them were willing to feed him			1
contrast this with the softly - softly approach of human rights - obsessed @entity4 , where prison officials paid £ 650 to fit special hook - friendly taps in his @entity11 cell			1
for now , his @entity7 lawyers have won him the right to wear his hooks for short periods each day so he can feed and wash himself			0
and the @entity7 government has agreed to pay around $ 16,000 for a set of rubber prosthetic hands — though only the basic model , officials stress			0
while @entity4 taxpayers paid millions for his detention costs , a @entity7 @entity154 spokesman stressed that official policy states all inmates ’ health services ‘ will be obtained at the lowest possible cost ’			1
helping out : defence lawyer @entity161 exits a court in @entity32 , @entity101 , following the arraignment of his client , accused terrorist @entity2 , on tuesday @entity2 has , at least , managed to wrangle a new pair of anti-slip trainers after his lawyer pleaded that , without his hooks to break his fall , he could injure himself if he trips over			1
such are the concerns these days of the infamous preacher of hate			0
while he waits to go on trial — which could take anywhere from nine months to two years — @entity2 will remain in the bleak @entity101 jail that has housed fraudster @entity177 and mafia boss @entity178			1
the 14 - storey concrete building has held previous terror suspects in solitary confinement for 23 hours a day , and 24 hours at weekends			1
@entity2 ’s hour of exercise in a caged area on the roof is likely to be equally lonely , say ex-wardens			0
@entity188 arms dealer @entity187 , known as the @entity189 , has spent 14 months there in solitary confinement			1
his lawyers claimed conditions were ‘ barbaric ’ , comparing it with the imprisonment of the fictional @entity196 and complaining that @entity187 had been denied ‘ basic , @entity198 - given rights , like fresh air and sun ’			1
unfortunately for @entity187 , it looks as if he will be transferred to somewhere his lawyers described as ‘ even worse ’ — the ‘ @entity203 ’ @entity203 facility in @entity204			0
@entity203 , nicknamed the @entity203 , is @entity7 ’s toughest prison for its roughest prisoners			0
after the @entity7 gave assurances that @entity2 would not be sent to the military base at @entity209 , the @entity203 is almost certain to be his destination if convicted			0
almost all @entity7 ’s most notorious terrorists , domestic or foreign , are held here , with the country ’s most vicious gang leaders and drug lords			0
anger : @entity85 , a local @entity7 congressman and chairman of the @entity87 , described @entity2 as ' obviously an arrogant b * * * * * d ' and an ' evil person ' @entity2 had long fought extradition at the @entity221 by claiming that conditions at @entity223 to torture , but this was rejected by the court			2
suffice to say that @entity203 , described by a former warden as a ‘ clean version of @entity229 ’ , is a far cry from @entity11			0
at the latter , which houses some of @entity4 ’s most dangerous men , staff and prisoners are increasingly intimidated by @entity236 inmates , who account for one in five of the prison population			1
@entity239 extremists — who sit at the top of the prison pecking order and are widely feared — are reportedly recruiting new followers unmolested in @entity11 ’s prison yard			0
in such an environment , according to the counter-extremism think - tank the @entity245 , @entity2 — who resided in a maximum - security cell , but not solitary confinement — was able to communicate with fellow prisoners and even deliver sermons , without attracting the attention of warders , by banging on the pipes			1
there are no pipes with which to talk to any of the other 250 inmates at the @entity203			0
and though there are plenty of other @entity239 extremists , including some he inspired , @entity2 would n’t be fraternising with them			0
prisoners live in virtual isolation , confined 23 hours a day under tight lockdown conditions in tiny cells			0
in each , there is only a concrete bed and thin mattress , an immovable concrete desk and stool , a combined lavatory , sink and drinking fountain , and — if he is lucky — a small black and white tv showing educational and religious programmes			0
other inmates : while he waits to go on trial - which could take from nine months to two years - @entity2 will remain in the bleak jail that has housed fraudster @entity177 ( left ) and mafia boss @entity178 ( right ) a 4in wide window , little more than an arrow slit , looks out on to an inner courtyard , but only shows the roof and sky to prevent prisoners working out their location for an escape			1
inmates exercise in a concrete pit resembling an empty swimming pool , also designed to stop them working out where they are in the building			0
communication with the outside world is severely limited under restrictions known as @entity295 , or @entity296			0
a prisoner such as @entity2 would be able to communicate with only a handful of other inmates , while personal phone calls would be restricted to select family members and are always monitored			0
lawyers warn that @entity2 ’s family — his wife is still living in a £ 1 million council house in @entity12 — may not be allowed into the @entity7 to see him			2
previous inmates have nothing good to say about the @entity203			0
in letters to a local newspaper , convicted bomber @entity308 complained that the regime is intended to ‘ inflict pain and misery ’			0
conditions — particularly the isolation and sensory deprivation — have prompted six suicides and hundreds of hunger - strike protests , most recently by shoebomber @entity68			2
and in june , a lawsuit on behalf of mentally ill prisoners there claimed some were so disturbed they were swallowing razor blades , smearing faeces around their cells and banging their heads against walls for hours on end			2
other @entity203 residents include 9/11 architect @entity66 , the so - called @entity330 @entity330 — who murdered three people and injured many others — and five @entity83 terrorists convicted of the 1988 @entity7 embassy bombings in @entity335 and @entity336			2
@entity338 , the lawyer who represented @entity2 in his tortuous extradition proceedings , has been trying to elicit sympathy for his client , whom he says has diabetes , psoriasis and high blood pressure			2
chiding @entity4 for not trying @entity2 itself on some of the charges he faces in the @entity7 , he has trotted out the standard line of lawyers defending notorious clients that ‘ a test of a civilised society is how it treats people it despises ’			1
in which case , as @entity2 is about to discover , @entity7 is considerably less civilised than @entity4 .			1
