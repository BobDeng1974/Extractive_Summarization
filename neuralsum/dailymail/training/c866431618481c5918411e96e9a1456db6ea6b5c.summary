@entity0 , irritated by the tv scheduling , said : ‘ we are in trouble because we have so many injured players and that makes it even more difficult for us			1
‘ we have only one day to prepare			0
we now have a difficult match because they are doing very well in their league and doing very well against superior teams in the @entity5			2
it ’s a big day for them			0
we know it will be difficult for us			0
‘ @entity4 in the @entity5 is not a friendly			1
we have to play matches with respect and the best way to respect @entity4 is to go there with a good team ; not to go there with a weak team and lose			2
‘ if they win , they win , but they win against a good team			0
we are in a difficult situation but when you look at the players who did n’t play , ( @entity60 ) @entity59 , ( @entity62 ) @entity61 , ( @entity64 ) @entity63 , ( @entity66 ) @entity65 , ( @entity67 ) @entity67 , these boys are obviously going to have to play			0

@entity0 added : ‘ the virus is fine			2
@entity84 celebrates his goal at @entity14 on sunday with @entity1 team - mates @entity98 and @entity75 ‘ it was hard when he went to hospital and it obviously does n’t him help to recover from the injury			1
but he did n’t go to @entity10 because of the injury , not because of the virus			0
‘ he aggravated the hamstrings because he played two matches in three days ( with @entity78 ) and was not with us			0
’ @entity0 will give opportunities to younger players at @entity111 and is considering giving 19 - year - old @entity112 some first - team experience in the fourth - round tie			1
the @entity1 manager added : ‘ @entity112 has a long way to go but he has the potential			0
