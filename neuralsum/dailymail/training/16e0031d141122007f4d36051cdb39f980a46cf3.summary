by @entity0 published : 01:35 est , 26 june 2013 updated : 02:07 est , 26 june 2013 moors murderer @entity1 has bragged he is as notorious as @entity3 and @entity4 was ' obsessed ' with the way he tortured , sexually abused and murdered five children			1
in a four - hour self serving rant yesterday , @entity7 said he is still famous for ' theatrical reasons ' because he buried bodies on the moors , drawing comparisons to @entity15 's ' @entity14 and all that '			1
the 75 - year - child killer then complained to his @entity18 mental health tribunal that since he was jailed for life in 1966 he felt like a ' monkey in a cage being poked with a stick '			1
' why are they [ the public ] still talking about @entity3 , after a century ? because of the dramatic background , the fog , cobbled streets , ' he said			1
' mine 's the same ... @entity14 , @entity29			1
' self - obsessed : moors murderer @entity1 ( left yesterday and right in 1966 ) boasted that he was as notorious as @entity3 because of his terrible crimes not once did he mention his poor victims , but when pressed on the five child murders he committed with @entity33 , he described himself as a ‘ petty criminal ’ in comparison with @entity36 , whom he accused of ‘ minting a fortune from his war crimes ’			1
drama : @entity7 claimed the ' theatrical ' elements of @entity3 , like the fog and cobbled streets , meant his moors murders were just as notorious in his soft @entity46 accent , he described the notorious 1960s killings as ‘ recreational ’ and an ‘ existential experience ’			1
the notorious criminal , who wants to be sent back to prison from @entity53 secure hospital , won the right to have a mental health tribunal held in public at an estimated cost of £ 250,000			1
he wants to be judged ‘ sane ’ to be allowed to be transferred from secure hospital to a jail			0
indeed , he yesterday said he was simply ‘ method acting ’ at the time he was diagnosed as mentally ill. it came as @entity7 ’s taxpayer - funded opportunity to present his twisted view of the world was yesterday condemned as an ‘ immoral farce ’ by families of his victims			1
relatives of the victims watching proceedings – relayed by video from the @entity73 hospital to a @entity18 courtroom – waited in vain for any signs of remorse			2
one described the event as ‘ the @entity80 ’ while another said it was an insult to those he killed			2
@entity7 , a diagnosed narcissist , regaled the hearing with boasts about his days in a maximum security prison with the @entity87 , @entity89 killers and @entity90			1
seizing the opportunity of being heard in public for the first time since his jailing in 1966 , he delivered four hours of rambling , paranoia - filled testimony and accused the public of being obsessed with him			0
not once did he mention any of those he killed			2
claiming that he was the real victim , @entity7 – who has fought for a public hearing over the state of his mental health for a decade – complained that the public and media remained as ‘ obsessed ’ with his crimes as with @entity3 ’s			1
victims : @entity105 , whose body has never been recovered , left , and @entity107 , right , were two of the youngsters killed by @entity111 murderer @entity1 during the 1960s lured to their deaths : @entity7 and his partner @entity33 killed @entity1 , left , in october 1965			1
@entity116 , right , 16 , disappeared on her way to a disco on july 12 , 1963 ‘ it fascinates them because of the dramatic background – fog , capes , cobbled streets , ’ he said			0
‘ @entity111 is the same thing			0
@entity14 and all that , @entity29 ... ’ he denied that talking to himself is evidence of schizophrenia , asking ‘ who does n’t ? ’ and criticised the psychiatrists who had tried to treat him , saying : ‘ they ’re worse than the patients			0
’ @entity33 , @entity7 's partner , who was convicted alongside him for the killings			0
she died in 2002 , aged 60 , still a prisoner @entity7 said @entity53 had been ‘ decent and progressive ’ when he arrived in 1985 but had become a ‘ penal warehouse ’ by 1999 when he was forcibly moved to a ward for those with severe personality disorders – the ‘ catalyst ’ for his subsequent hunger strike			1
in a convoluted explanation of why he claims to be sane , @entity7 said that if he were to claim he ‘ recreationally killed ’ , that would seem to be evidence of madness , but that if he knew precisely what he meant , ‘ therefore i ’m not mad ’			0
@entity147 , the older brother of @entity148 , who was murdered at the age of ten in 1964 , said : ‘ this hearing is a farce and it only serves to cause more grief for the families of the victims			1
‘ i think it is appalling that the public should have to pay for this hearing when all it is designed to do is put him back in the public eye			2
’ @entity160 , whose brother @entity161 , 12 , was murdered by @entity7 and @entity33 in 1963 , said the pair ’s five victims had been forgotten and the hearing was ‘ a total sham ’			2
mr @entity107 , 59 , said it was ‘ shocking and immoral ’ that the money had been spent fulfilling @entity7 ’s demands instead of a new hunt for the remains of 12 - year - old @entity105 , which have never been found			0
@entity105 ’s mother , @entity1 , had pledged to attend the hearing to ‘ look @entity7 in the eye ’ and demand he finally divulge their whereabouts , but she died last year aged 78			1
@entity7 denied the account of nurses that he secretly supplemented force - feeding with soup and toast or that he had tried to stab one with a pen last september			0
he insisted he would be able to cope with the stricter regime of prison , saying that instead of reacting to provocation ‘ i then pick up the pen and do the damage by writing immediately to the right people on the outside ’			0
@entity7 has been incarcerated at the secure hospital since 1985 and on ' hunger strike ' since 1999 ' why are they still talking about @entity3 after a century ? because of the dramatic background , the fog , cobbled streets			2
the @entity111 is the same ... @entity14 , @entity29 i was pretending to be insane when i arrived at @entity53			2
have you never heard of method acting ? what value did i get from killing ? existential experience			1
some of these psychiatrists , - i would throw a net over them			0
they 're worse than the patients			0
' pressed repeatedly on whether he would starve himself to death if allowed back to prison , he hinted that he would , saying : ‘ after 50 years i ’ve had enough			2
i ’m simply saying , “ keep it , keep the rest , i ’m going now ”			0
’ he added that were his force - feeding to continue in prison , ‘ i then have another plan in mind ’			0
@entity7 said he had ‘ no ambitions ’ for the future : ‘ i know that i am in until death			0
i have known from day one that i ’m finished			0
’ judge @entity217 , chairing the panel , opened proceedings by acknowledging relatives ’ anger but insisting the tribunal ’s job was to focus on @entity7 ’s mental health , not his crimes			1
however he and fellow panel members pressed @entity227 about his murders , asking if they were not evidence of an abnormal mind			0
@entity7 said that were he an outside observer , he would ‘ immediately ’ say such a person was ‘ mad ’ and an ‘ extreme danger ’ , but then went on to suggest politicians and soldiers committed more serious crimes			0
following his evidence , dr @entity238 , a consultant psychologist called in support of @entity7 ’s claim , told the hearing the killer had been ‘ evasive in the extreme ’			2
@entity7 ’s legal team have argued he has severe personality disorders but is not mentally ill and could be treated in prison rather than hospital			0
but expert psychologists called by @entity53 say @entity7 is a chronically ill paranoid schizophrenic who should remain at the hospital			2
@entity7 is wants to be judged ' sane ' so he can be transferred from @entity53 to prison			1
