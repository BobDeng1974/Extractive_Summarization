i was walking down the street in @entity2 in broad daylight and getting into my car when two @entity6 guys approached me			1
one of them said he was leaving @entity9 the next day and would love a photo with me for his cafe back home			1
i stood in the road shaking hands with him as his friend took a picture			1
out of the corner of my eye i saw a man powering towards me like a bat out of hell			1
he looked like the type who works out and moved very fast			1
he punched me so many times i kept thinking , ‘ when is this going to stop ? ’ but it did n’t			1
i went into what boxers call ‘ peekaboo style ’ like @entity37 heavyweight @entity36 when he fought @entity38 , covering my face and eyes			1
he got frustrated his punches were n’t getting through and kicked me back towards the kerb			2
i lost my footing and staggered backwards , crashing into a grille on a @entity6 delicatessen i had eaten at a few hours earlier			2
i was on the ground thinking ‘ this man is going to kick me to death ’			2
battered : mr @entity24 , pictured after the assault , said the man moved toward him like ' a bat out of hell ' tweet : the @entity53 tweeted this comment with the above picture of mr @entity24 following the assault he was so enraged he got on top of me and eventually landed a haymaker right on my jaw			1
i felt a terrible crack and sickening thud			2
it went on for about three minutes – a long time when punches are raining down on you			2
luckily , the two @entity6 guys pulled him off			2
my attacker calmly walked across the road and i drove up the road behind him			0
i was in a bad way but i was determined he would n’t get away with it			0
i called 999 and described him to police			0
he knew i was behind him			0
i slowed down and the police told me to stop following him			0
i pulled the car over and saw him go down a side street			1
while i was talking to the police , he reappeared and walked over to a bus stop			0
scene of the crime : mr @entity24 was attacked in @entity85 ( pictured ) in @entity2 , @entity86 at this point a police van hurtled round the corner with four police officers in it			1
it was like @entity94 and @entity95			0
i shouted , ‘ he is getting on the no 23 bus ’ and the police drove into the @entity99 to stop it			0
the policewomen bravely piled on to the bus , and brought a man out with handcuffs on			0
i have no idea why it happened , though i suspect my attacker was a thug from an extreme right - wing group			0
regardless of his motives , i have no regrets about speaking out on issues like @entity113 and the @entity114			0
we live in a democracy , and as someone who has been elected as an mp on six occasions , i have a right to voice my opinions			1
and like other politicians who have suffered similar threats and attacks , i am entitled to receive a degree of protection from the @entity127 so i can continue to do so			1
even though i have just turned 60 years old , i am slightly ashamed to admit that i did n’t land a single blow			0
but i am not ready to stop fighting for what i believe in yet			0
