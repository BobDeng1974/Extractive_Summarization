@entity0 up with @entity1 , or coming to realise , in the words of @entity3 , ‘ too many tweets might make a t * * t ’ ? it may be time to consider a short , sharp trip to the suburbs of @entity11			2
here , in a collection of drab , concrete buildings surrounding a large courtyard is a military - style bootcamp designed with one thing in mind : to treat victims of a very modern disease — a compulsive addiction to electronic gadgets			1
formed in 2006 , the @entity22 ( @entity23 ) has so far welcomed 6,000 mostly young , mostly male patients — and claims to have ‘ cured ’ 75 per cent of them			1
the centre believes internet addiction leads to brain problems similar to those from taking heroin online zombies : a line of dead - eyed @entity39 youths play computer games at an internet cafe			1
the country 's government said internet addiction affects 24 million of its 632 million internet users smart salute : at the @entity22 , it ’s time to put down that mouse , pull on a camouflage t - shirt and learn to click heels , not screen icons the man behind the facility is @entity55 , a doctor and colonel in the @entity57 , regarded as @entity39 ’s leading expert in wangyin , or internet addiction , which is said by the country ’s government to affect 24 million of its 632 million internet users			1
he describes wangyin as a form of mental illness , saying that 90 per cent of his patients are clinically depressed from a lack of normal social interaction			2
many have back and eyesight problems due to spending up to 14 hours a day staring at screens , and a third suffer from eating disorders			0
‘ internet addiction leads to problems in the brain similar to those derived from heroin consumption but , generally , it ’s even more damaging , ’ mr @entity55 said recently			1
‘ it destroys relationships and deteriorates the body without the person knowing			0
’ to break it , mr @entity55 confiscates all electronic devices from patients and forces them to follow a super-strict , military - style fitness regime , starting with parade drills at 6.30 each morning			1
they must also endure occasional spells in solitary confinement and take regular medication			0
progress is monitored by psychiatric assessments and regular brain scans			0
mr @entity55 only considers someone cured if , six months after their release , they use the internet for fewer than six hours per day			2
some critics have called the techniques brutal			0
but they also yield results and there is high demand for places : the @entity23 , which charges £ 1,000 per month ( more than twice the average @entity39 urban worker ’s wage ) recently expanded , so it can treat 130 patients at any one time			2
work that body : military - style drills , exercises and weekly tai chi sessions help the young addicts to shed their indoor pallor open wide : a nurse checks that 14 - year - old @entity116 has taken his medication — all part of the £ 1,000 - a - month bootcamp it is n’t alone : there are around 300 such clinics in @entity39 , due largely to an explosion in the popularity of online games such as @entity126			1
many internet cafes have beds , so customers can sleep at their keyboards , and @entity131 recently passed a law forcing parents to stop minors ‘ being overindulgent with online and electronic games ’			0
meanwhile in @entity137 , where @entity1 and @entity138 are national obsessions , there are dozens of so - called internet ‘ fasting camps ’			0
@entity142 is also facing up to internet addiction — in january , its government voted to fine parents who allow children to spend ‘ excessive time using electronic products ’			1
tough love : good posture is required at the super-strict bootcamp			0
here , pupil @entity153 is encouraged to stand straight no rest for the internet addicted : the day starts at 6.30am and is run with military precision , even for this very young inmate			0

@entity159 in @entity11 has welcomed 6,000 patients since it opened its doors in 2006
the military - style bootcamp claims to have cured 75 per cent of their addiction to electronic gadgets
internet addiction or wangyin is said to affect 24 million of the @entity39 's 632 million web users
