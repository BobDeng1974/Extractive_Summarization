@entity4 , @entity13 has been described as a love letter to the capital , rooted in the grim reality of everyday life for its citizens			1
film - makers on the set of @entity4 , @entity19 , created a decade after the fall of the cinema - hating @entity8 issues such as forced marriage , people smuggling , illegal land grabs , land mines and ethnic conflict is explored through 10 interwoven stories in the film			1
@entity2 's film industry was hammered by 17 years of war after the @entity35 invasion in 1979 and was snuffed out entirely under the extreme rule of the @entity8			1
during their 1996 - 2001 regime , the extremists closed cinemas and hung televisions from lampposts , regarding all images as un-islamic			2
even sculptures were targeted , with the famous giant @entity44 paying the price			0
now @entity2 cinema is struggling to re-emerge amid a wrecked economy and an ongoing insurgency against the @entity50 - backed government of president @entity51			1
according to documentary - maker @entity52 , @entity2 produces about 100 films a year but they are usually shot on small budgets and are often very poor			1
@entity4 , @entity13 has been funded by the @entity57 mission in @entity2 , @entity58 , as a means of giving the country 's cinema a boost			1

@entity2 cinema is struggling to re-emerge amid a wrecked economy and an ongoing insurgency against the @entity50 - backed government of president @entity51 young men watch crew members from @entity4 , @entity13 working on set			2
@entity2 produces about 100 films a year but they are usually shot on small budgets and are often very poor he said : ' we wanted to reach the film - makers , to support them , to communicate with @entity2 people			1
' not with our messages but with theirs			0
we hope they reflect the @entity2 society and the @entity2 ideas of that time			2
' however , funding the project was not without its problems			0
one of the 11 directors chosen from 200 applicants fled the country as soon as he got his hands on @entity58 's $ 8,000 , while another left for @entity89 after being threatened			0
however , despite these setbacks , shooting for the film was completed and it got a warm reception when it was screened at the @entity95 cultural centre in @entity4 in may			0
while some of the entries betrayed the directors ' lack of experience - with exaggerated characters , hammy dialogue and a deathly slow pace - other showed real flair			0
critics particularly liked the modest and restrained dialogue of @entity108 's bitter denunciation of forced marriage			1
in the short section - titled @entity112 - the caretaker of a mosque learns that a pretty young woman in his place of worship has fled her family to escape marrying one of her relatives			0
in the last five years , writers and artists have been pushing boundaries in what remains an extremely conservative society in @entity2 the young woman , denounced by a neighbour , ends up running from the police			2
her heavy breath and field of vision restricted by the burqa she wears to hide herself allow the viewer to feel the horror of the condition of women in @entity2			2
@entity137 said he based the film on experiences he had as a young man looking after a mosque			0
he said : ' during that time , a girl was coming for prayers			0
she would rest in the mosque two hours after the prayers			0
i wanted to know who this girl is , but i was ashamed and because of religion , i never asked her what her problems were			0
' @entity52 hailed @entity137 's achievement , saying he had ' managed to get closer to @entity2 realities ' than other film - makers			1
@entity52 added that , in the last five years , writers and artists have been pushing boundaries in what remains an extremely conservative society			0
he said : ' now , people have started to realise that if they cross borders , nothing will happen to them			0
' @entity162 forces are due to depart @entity2 by the end of 2014 and the precarious security situation they will leave behind is not likely to be conducive to this dream of artistic growth			2
it is hoped @entity4 , i love you will send out a message of hope to budding film - makers and other citizens of @entity2 .			1
