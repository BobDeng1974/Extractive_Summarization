@entity1 today called for @entity23 to stay in the @entity18 , as he visited @entity25 's @entity24 , where he met @entity27 @entity26 hammering : the prime minister hammered the bung , a ceremonial tradition in the scotch whisky industry , into a cask of @entity34 single grain spirit produced using renewable energy from the bioenergy plant planning and practice for the landings took place north of the @entity41 and @entity4 servicemen were among the first to land on @entity43			1

plea : @entity1 used a speech in @entity13 today to invoke the d - day landings and the @entity49 as he appealed for @entity7 to ' face the future together ' the @entity55 leader 's intervention follows claims from deputy snp leader @entity57 that @entity4 and the rest of the @entity18 could be the ‘ closest of allies and the best of neighbours ’ if there is a ‘ yes ’ vote in next year ’s referendum			1
in a speech at @entity67 last night , @entity65 said the model of the @entity69 that brings @entity71 countries together could be adopted post-independence			2
her suggestion is the latest attempt by the @entity74 to ease fears about separation , with the party previously announcing plans to keep the @entity79 as head of state and use the @entity18 pound			2
but a spokesman for the anti-independence @entity82 campaign last night rejected the @entity74 ’s vision and said : ‘ the idea that separation actually means co-operation is like arguing that black is white			0
’ mr @entity1 also warned that ‘ breaking - up @entity18 ’ is not the answer to the country ’s problems			0
@entity55 activists gathered in @entity13 today , where @entity4 leader @entity93 faces pressure to unite the party behind her			1
some msps are known to be concerned about her leadership approach , and a large number of members are worried about her new - found support for further devolution			0

proud in our individual identities – but working together for a common good			0
‘ we saw it when our soldiers fought together under one flag on the beaches of @entity20			0
‘ we saw it when our doctors came together to build our @entity128			0
we saw it in the scientific breakthroughs that we made together , from the television to penicillin			1
‘ and we saw it last summer as athletes from around @entity18 – no matter where they were from – draped themselves in one flag			0
’ @entity136 : the flag of the @entity138 planted on the beach in @entity20 after the d - day landings remembrance : @entity144 , sapper @entity142 , 91 , at a wreath laying ceremony to commemorate the 69th anniversary of the start of the d - day landings at @entity149 this week @entity150 : ( @entity151 ) @entity152 , 88 and @entity153 , 89 were in the @entity138 dropping troops and supplies onto @entity43 , and @entity156 , 88 who was in the @entity158 and was on @entity159 on d - day mr @entity1 said there is ‘ still so much more to come ’			2
‘ why would n’t we want to face the future together ? ’ he asked			0
‘ there is simply no challenge we face today where breaking - up @entity18 is the right answer			0
the future i see for @entity4 is part of a dynamic , enterprising , prosperous , compassionate @entity18			1
‘ a @entity18 that is n’t just competing in the global race , but winning in the world			0
a country where we are pulling together , not pulling apart			0
’ but miss @entity57 last night claimed that independence would create a ‘ healthier relationship ’ between @entity4 and the rest of the @entity18			1
@entity74 leader mr @entity175 added : ‘ the people of @entity4 want and deserve a quality debate on @entity4 ’s future – and @entity57 ’s positive speech about the relationship of equality we seek with our friends south of the @entity41 stands in stark contrast to the fears and smears that are all we have heard from the no campaign so far			1
‘ it is time for the no campaign to draw a line in the sand under their fears and smears about @entity4 , and fulfil their pledge to pursue a positive campaign based on reality			2
’ mr @entity1 also invoked the @entity49 success of @entity4 including sir @entity199 and scientific breakthroughs , including @entity202 's discovery of penicillin , as proof that the @entity18 has a history of shared endeavour mr @entity175 also called for a head - to - head debate with the prime minister – something the ‘ no ’ campaign has rejected because mr @entity1 is ineligible to vote in the referendum			1
instead , better together leader @entity212 has offered to debate with the first minister			2
responding to @entity65 ’s speech , a campaign spokesman said last night : ‘ there already exists a strong vehicle for co-operation across our island			2
it ’s called the @entity18 and it works well			0
’ @entity4 office minister @entity222 added : ‘ the deputy first minister ’s speech ignores the fact that @entity4 and the rest of the @entity18 are already the closest of allies and best of neighbours			1
