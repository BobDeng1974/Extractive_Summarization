by @entity1 - @entity0 published : 17:04 est , 16 november 2013 updated : 08:06 est , 18 november 2013 with its bright red front door and light and airy interior , this particular @entity3 terrace townhouse is probably the last place you would expect a shady spy to live			2
but no 9 @entity9 in @entity10 is the address that author @entity12 picked as the home for his fictional @entity15 intelligence officer , @entity14			1
over the years , @entity14 – who is the central character in five le carré novels and a minor character in three more – has been portrayed on screen by @entity20 , @entity21 , @entity22 and @entity23			1
hideaway : no 9 @entity9 in @entity10 is the address @entity12 picked as the home for @entity15 intelligence officer @entity14 and the 1979 @entity28 series of @entity29 , starring sir @entity21 , used @entity9 itself to show @entity14 ’s home			1
@entity14 is seen walking along the road and interior scenes were filmed next door to no 9			1
the current owner of no 9 , @entity37 , has on her mantelpiece a framed copy of a letter from former @entity42 master le @entity12 – written under his real name of @entity12 – explaining why he chose @entity9			1
he says he knew the area because @entity46 , the literary scout who ‘ spotted ’ his breakthrough novel @entity47 , lived in nearby @entity48 , and a ‘ mrs @entity49 , a mother of a pupil of mine at @entity42 , lived in @entity9 itself ’			1
memorabilia : the current owner of @entity55 , @entity37 , has on her mantlepiece a framed copy of a letter from le @entity12 the letter continues : ‘ i chose @entity60 because it ’s a @entity61 , which is always a headache for watchers			1
‘ i reckoned @entity14 would give himself that sort of advantage over life			1
the intimacy of the street made it doubly difficult for a surveillance team to escape notice			2
’ @entity37 , who was told that she was moving into @entity14 ’s house only after she ’d bought it , can attest to the friendliness of the street			1
‘ some people have been here 30 years			2
there ’s a street party once a year , they close the street , and have a paddling pool for the little ones in the afternoon			2
and then , when they ’ve gone to bed , the wine comes out			2
’ @entity37 ’s two sons have left home , so she no longer needs as much space and is now selling up and moving to a nearby flat she owns			1
‘ more than anything it ’s the people i ’ll miss , ’ she says			0
‘ it ’s very arty round here – there ’s a writer , a designer , a journalist , and everyone ’s very friendly			0
’ originally from @entity95 , property designer @entity37 has been in the house for 18 years			0
‘ before i lived here , i came to @entity3 once a year to get my hair cut and buy some clothes , ’ she says			0
‘ after my husband died , i was looking for a small flat south of the river but it ’s like going into a dress shop – you get carried away ! ‘ i find it ’s a very safe area ; we do n’t have problems here			0
because it ’s a @entity61 , it ’s always quiet			0
’ but she adds that the street does attract attention – and not just because of the @entity14 connection			1
‘ it ’s always been a very photographed street , ’ she says , pointing out that , with the facades of the houses all painted different colours , it is visually striking			0
‘ you get a lot of fashion shoots			0
’ @entity37 ’s house – which has three bedrooms , two bathrooms and a west - facing garden – is for sale at £ 3.25 million			0
luxury : the stylish living room where the spy would put his feet up the house is certainly noticeably brighter and fresher - looking than the gloomy interior that @entity14 inhabits in the @entity28 adaptation			1
‘ my style is not contemporary , it ’s classic with a homely touch , ’ @entity37 says			0
‘ i do designs on a lot of corporate properties for business people and my work has got to appeal to both male and female			0
i went to gardening college and the only thing i learnt was that when you have a view , like the sea , you do n’t have to create a drama inside			0
‘ when you live somewhere like here and you have a view of , say , a brick wall , albeit a very nice brick wall , you ’ve got to make the interest inside			0
’ clean lines : the elegant bathroom echoes the simplicity of the rest of the house she says that in her work she wants to help people have the confidence to express their own taste , adding : ‘ my own taste has always been completely white			0
’ her home is tastefully decorated but it is not without wit – there is a cushion in one of the bedrooms which reads : ‘ @entity172			2
’ @entity173 , negotiator at @entity174 and @entity176 ’s @entity10 office , says : ‘ with their multi-coloured facades , @entity9 ’s quintessential @entity10 cottages have attracted both @entity179 and international buyers throughout the years			1
’ he adds that while no 9 is ‘ a perfect house for an @entity179 gentleman spy ’ , it also has ‘ the potential for development , subject to the usual consents ’			2
drama : the @entity15 intelligence officer was played by sir @entity21 in the 1979 @entity28 series of @entity191			1

no 9 @entity9 in @entity10 is the fictional home of agent @entity14
was chosen by author @entity12 and used in eight of his novels
the 1979 @entity28 series of @entity29 , starring sir @entity21 , used the address during filming
