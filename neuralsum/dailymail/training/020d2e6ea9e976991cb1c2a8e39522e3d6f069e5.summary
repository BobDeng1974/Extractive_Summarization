by @entity1 reporter published : 19:52 est , 4 january 2014 updated : 02:22 est , 5 january 2014 @entity3 : when @entity6 congressman @entity5 was voted out of office last year , he retired to his remote @entity9 compound sitting on 153 acres of land to live out his days off the grid			1
former congressman @entity5 has swapped his suit and tie for a pair of denim overalls and retreated into the dense woods of @entity9 , where he has been living off the grid in preparation for natural or man - made doomsday			1
@entity5 , a small - government , @entity21 - style @entity20 , had spent two decades as the @entity23 representative for @entity6 's 6th congressional district			1
in 2013 , he was voted out of office and replaced with democrat @entity26 thanks to the process of gerrymandering			0
over the course of his career in public service , @entity5 used his status as a @entity23 congressman to sound the alarm about the vulnerability of the @entity23 power grid , @entity29 reported in a lengthy profile			1
speaking on the @entity40 floor , @entity5 prophesied that if the @entity23 failed to act , an attack on the electrical system would plunge the nation into darkness and chaos : imagine the @entity47 blackout of 2004 stretched over six months or longer			2
@entity5 's warnings of catastrophic electromagnetic pulse attacks and solar flares fell on deaf ears and earned him a reputation as a crank			1
but when the 87 - year - old politician left office last year , he decided to practice what he preached by going off the grid			1
eccentric : @entity5 , pictured here with then - @entity61 @entity60 in 2006 , had spent years sounding the alarm about @entity64 - electromagnetic pulses that could knock out @entity23 's power grid @entity5 and his wife , @entity66 , retired to their remote @entity9 retreat to live out their days almost entirely independent of the system			1
the lakeside compound made up of five solar - powered cabins - with a sixth under construction - is nestled in a wooded area on a 4,000 - foot elevation four hours from @entity77 @entity5 bought the 153 - acre property back in 1980 for $ 80,000 and has spent the past three decades improving the amenities built to house his 10 adult children and their families in case of a doomsday scenario			1
the bucolic property boasts a manmade lake with a pair of swans , saw and flour mill , and several vegetable gardens			0
in the fall , @entity5 was still in the process of building another cabin , which will feature a large kitchen , composting toilets , a root cellar - and even internet access via satellite			2
every couple of weeks , the survivalist octogenarian shaves off his white beard , dons a suit and heads to the capital , where he serves as a senior consultant for a cybersecurity company called @entity106			0
crank : even among fellow republicans like conservative @entity110 congressman @entity109 ( left ) , @entity5 got a reputation for being somewhat odd back home in @entity9 , @entity5 spends up to 12 hours tending to his vast property : cutting logs , gardening and making needed repairs			1
despite his advanced age , @entity5 , a vegetarian , is reportedly in excellent health only slightly marred by arthritis and acid reflux			0
but his old - age ailments do not stop from rising before dawn six days a week			0
the son of a farmer , @entity5 said he learned everything he needed to build his rustic refuge while growing up in western @entity126 during the @entity127			0
he completed his early education in a one - room schoolhouse and went on to earn his bachelor 's degree in theology and biology from @entity133 ( now @entity133 ) in @entity6			2
@entity5 continued his studies , earning a master 's degree and phd in physiology , and embarking on a career as a college professor			2
the young scientist later switched gears , working for @entity142 and serving as a @entity144 engineer before becoming director of the @entity147 research group at @entity148 , where he helped the @entity23 defeat the @entity149 in the space race			2
when he was elected to @entity151 in 1980 , @entity5 stood out among @entity20 and got a reputation for being quirky and eccentric : he espoused libertarian values long before the emergence of the @entity21 and advocated for going green years before it was cool			0
@entity21 libertarian : @entity5 , pictured next to speaker of the house @entity157 in 2011 , pushed for budget cuts and voted against minimum wage increase as a staunch opponent of big government , @entity5 voted against minimum wage increases and against extending financial help to the cash - strapped @entity166			0
with virtually no support from his party , @entity5 pushed @entity151 to allocate billions of dollars to harden @entity23 's power grid so it could withstand an electromagnetic pulse ( @entity173 ) attack by an enemy armed with a warhead capable of wreaking havoc on the nation ’s infrastructure			1
but to @entity5 ’s chagrin , his colleagues on the @entity180 ignored his warnings , instead choosing to focus on more pressing matters			0
‘ if an event is going to end life as you know it , how can you say it ’s too expensive ? ’ he told the magazine			0
‘ it is an absolute certainty it ’ll happen			0

@entity5 , 87 , left office last year after serving as representative of @entity6 's 6th congressional district for 20 years
he had spent years sounding the alarm about @entity64 - electromagnetic pulses that could knock out @entity23 's power grid
@entity5 and his wife retired to his 153 - acre compound in @entity9 *wilderness* to live off the grid

he still works part time as consultant for a *cyber-security* company in @entity77
