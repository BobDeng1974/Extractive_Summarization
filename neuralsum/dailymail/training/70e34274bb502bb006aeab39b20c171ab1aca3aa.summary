@entity0 have made a formal enquiry to @entity2 as they attempt to launch their rebuilding project with the signing of striker @entity5			2
the @entity6 under 21 international will see his contract expire at the end of next season and @entity0 believe that they can secure the forward ahead of the new season			0
as things stand , @entity2 manager @entity13 is demanding £ 8 million for @entity5 , who struck 26 goals as @entity2 were promoted from the @entity17 last season			1
@entity0 need a striker to replace @entity19 , who has joined @entity20 , and @entity5 fits the club ’s model to recruit young and ambitious @entity24 players			1
@entity34 and @entity35 are also monitoring the player ’s situation , while @entity39 sides @entity38 and @entity40 are also keeping tabs on @entity5			0
@entity0 are aware that foreign clubs will have the right to speak to @entity5 from january and they would be able to negotiate a pre-contract agreement with a reduced compensation rate from the turn of the year			0
wanted : @entity5 scored against @entity0 for @entity2 in the @entity47 last season @entity2 would ideally like to keep @entity5 at the club but there is also a recognition that they risk losing him for nothing if a deal can not be struck this summer			1
although @entity0 are reluctant to meet the asking price , the swathes of cash flowing into the club following the £ 31.5million sale of @entity58 to @entity59 and @entity60 ’s impending £ 25m move to @entity20 , means that the club may be prepared to take the hit as new manager @entity63 seeks to reconstruct his squad			2
