ms @entity8 , suffered severe injuries to her eyes , face and hands when @entity15 threw acid in her face in 2004 after she spurned his hand in marriage			1
in november 2008 , a criminal court in @entity43 ordered @entity15 to be blinded in both eyes under the country 's application of the sharia code of ' qisas ' , which allows retribution for violent crimes			1
but in july , he was given an eleventh hour reprieve when ms @entity8 exercised her right to pardon him			1
prison officials had been preparing to drop acid into his eyes when the pardon was delivered			1
miss @entity8 said the international interest in the case was one reason for deciding to drop her demand for the sentence to be carried out : ' it seemed like the entire world was waiting to see what we did			2
' the case attracted international media attention , and the human rights group @entity68 urged @entity12 not to inflict the retributive form of punishment			0
pictures of ms @entity8 before the acid attack in @entity43 , which left her blinded and disfigured after being pardoned , @entity15 's sentence was reduced to 10 years in prison			1
it is as a result of this new sentence that judiciary figures now say he no longer has to pay compensation			0
' even though i agreed to pardon mr @entity15 , i did n't think i was surrendering my right to compensation , ' ms @entity8 told the @entity32			2
she said her request for compensation was recognised at the time as legal by judiciary officials			0
' but then the deputy prosecutor said he had made a mistake and that my request for compensation had no legal grounds , ' she added			0
ms @entity8 says she needs the money to pay for further surgery			2
she has already spent more than £ 150,000 – partly funded by the @entity12 state – on treatment but more is needed			0
after being told she was no longer entitled to compensation , ms @entity8 says she was persuaded by @entity43 's deputy prosecutor to sign a document limiting her claim to injuries to her hands and face			2
now she has been told by a lawyer that the prosecutor 's ruling is in fact unlawful			0
she has responded by opening legal proceedings against the deputy prosecutor for abuse of trust and depriving her of her legal rights			0
' if @entity15 walks out of prison without paying the compensation money for my eyes , it means i have been subjected to injustice , ' she said .			0

@entity8 , 34 , offered chance to exact retribution by dropping acid into his eyes but **-** at the last minute **-** spared him
