@entity0 face a nervous run - chase to avoid the ignominy of being eliminated from the @entity3 at the first hurdle after @entity5 posted a challenging total here at the @entity7 this morning			1
@entity8 , who had never scored a one - day international hundred in his eight - year career , hit the first century by a @entity11 in any @entity3 as they reached 275 for seven , their highest one - day score against @entity0 , in this winner takes all @entity16 match			2
only a direct hit from @entity18 to run out @entity8 ended a partnership of 141 with @entity20 that gives @entity5 real hope of progressing to the quarter - finals at @entity0 ’s expense			0
it had all looked so positive for @entity0 when @entity25 took two wickets in his first seven balls to reduce @entity5 to eight for two after @entity28 had won the toss and elected to bowl on @entity32 ’s drop - in pitch			1
but @entity5 recovered so well , with the ‘ mighty atom ’ @entity20 eventually falling to @entity34 for 89 , that @entity0 will face a tense chase if they are to avoid what would arguably be the worst of their many woeful @entity38			0
now @entity0 , who brought in @entity40 and @entity41 for @entity42 and @entity43 , keep to hold their nerve against @entity5 ’s array of spinners if they are to live to fight another day in this @entity3			2
they really should be able to reach this target with ease but so low is confidence after three shattering defeats by @entity51 , @entity52 and @entity53 in this tournament that nothing can be guaranteed .			0

@entity0 will find themselves out of the @entity3 with defeat
