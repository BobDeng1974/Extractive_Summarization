by @entity0 who said a @entity2 ’s is the same wherever you go ? from the @entity5 outlet housed in giant happy meal boxes to the restaurant in a stunning 1930s @entity9 hotel , diners who have had enough of run - of - the - mill outlets can now choose to eat in any one of these 14 unusual locations			1
with over 35,000 restaurants across the globe , it comes as no surprise that the @entity18 chain , which serves food in 118 countries , has some rather off - the - beaten - track sites			2
and , unsurprisingly , most of these strange fast food locations are all in the @entity24			0
one outlet is housed in a preserved 19th - century @entity26 in @entity27 while another is in a converted 1930s @entity9 hotel , proving that that the fast - food giant does n't always obliterate the unique character and history of towns it descends on			1
but , alongside the sensitively restored buildings , are some frankly bizarre locations as well			0
there ’s an outlet smack bang in the middle of @entity42 ’s @entity41 desert where discerning diners can chow down on burgers against an arid landscape of sand dunes			0
and those with far - left leanings do n't have to miss out as the stalwarts of @entity18 capitalism have an outlet right below the @entity52 in @entity53			0
other unusual settings include the first ever ski - through restaurant , @entity55 in @entity56 , @entity57 , the @entity59 - shaped outlet in @entity60 , @entity61 and rather incongruously , a restaurant set against the backdrop of the magnificent mountains in the picture - postcard pretty village of @entity67 , southern @entity68			1
this outlet in @entity5 , @entity71 looks like a giant @entity74 box and and has giant sculptures of @entity77 fries , @entity70 and @entity2 plastered all over it the @entity79 , set against a backdrop of majestic hills , seem out of place in the picturesque village of @entity84 in @entity68 viva capitalism : @entity53 's @entity52 , which has immersive workshops , an interrogation room and historical schoolrooms also has a @entity2 's right below it take to the slopes : the world 's first fast - food ski - through is in the resort of @entity94 in @entity57			1
customers can ski right up to the counter , order their food and ski off sensitive restoration : try to spot the discreet @entity2 's sign			2
the restaurant is set in this 1850s colonial house in @entity102 , @entity103 which was once owned by a sea captain make a food withdrawal : formerly a bank in @entity107 , @entity108 this building now deals with nuggets of chicken rather than nuggets of gold the ground floor of the @entity115 in @entity116 has been home to @entity2 's since 1997 views of sand , sand and more sand is what greets diners at the @entity41 branch in @entity42			1
the outlet does brisk business with tourists passing through the desert on their way to @entity42 's resort towns @entity131 's in @entity132 is set in refurbished rail cars and has a towering sign on the water tower for those who might just miss seeing the outlet what 's the difference : the @entity79 were painted green in keeping with @entity140 , @entity142 's zoning ordinances			0
the company had to build a restaurant that blended into the natural setting it 's a @entity147 : the 20 - seater @entity2 's housed in a vintage luxury @entity150 plane with red and silver interior seats			2
the plane was bought by the fast - food chain who already have a restaurant next to it in @entity155 , @entity156 an invasion : do n't mistake this for a @entity59			2
the @entity60 outlet is , aptly enough , shaped like a flying saucer and attracts alien enthusiasts from across the world the colonial era @entity163 , set in a 19th - century @entity26 mansion in @entity166 , @entity27			1
local activists saved the building from being razed by petitioning to give it secured landmark status the @entity172 's in @entity173 , @entity171 comes with a retro dining room and neon lights			0
the building was once the @entity177 and was designed by architect @entity178 .			0

ski right up to the counter at the world 's first ski - through restaurant in @entity56 , @entity57
make like an alien and chomp down on nuggets at @entity60 's @entity59 - shaped restaurant
pop into the *larger* - than - life @entity74 box in @entity5 or eat in a restored 19th - century @entity26 mansion in @entity27
