by @entity0 published : 09:53 est , 22 april 2013 updated : 10:31 est , 22 april 2013 a mother who endured the agony of seeing one of her identical twins born with a crippling form of cerebral palsy has been given hope by a surgeon in the @entity9 @entity10 , 30 , hopes a revolutionary operation will allow two - year - old @entity12 to finally keep up with his brother , @entity13			1
the nursery nurse gave birth to the twins three months prematurely after a difficult pregnancy , and at eight - months - old @entity12 was diagnosed with @entity18 – a form of cerebral palsy which causes tightness in the muscles of the lower body			1
identical twins @entity12 ( right ) and @entity24 ( left ) , pictured with their parents @entity25 and @entity10 , were born three months prematurely			1
@entity12 was then diagnosed with cerebral palsy he now has a chance of walking thanks to @entity9 surgeons who will carry out a procedure to try and remove the abnormal sensory nerve fibres that cause his disability			1
the boys ' parents , from @entity36 , @entity37 , were delighted when they were told they were expecting twins			2
but doctors at @entity40 detected a problem with @entity13 's growth at mrs @entity10 ’s 20 week scan			0
she was admitted to @entity45 in @entity46 for round - the - clock monitoring when she was 26 weeks pregnant			0
the boys had to be delivered at 28 weeks because they developed a potentially fatal condition called twin - to - twin transfusion – this occurs when identical twins share a placenta and one baby receives more blood flow than the other			0
as they were so premature , they were given brain scans , which revealed that @entity13 was perfectly healthy but @entity12 had a ' flare ' on the back of his brain			2
at eight months , @entity12 ( left ) was diagnosed with @entity18 - a form of cerebral palsy which causes tightness in the muscles of the lower body the cerebral palsy means that @entity12 is unable to walk or crawl , so can not keep up with @entity13 it was diagnosed as periventricular leukomalacia ( @entity69 ) , a type of brain injury which may have been caused by their traumatic birth , and which can lead to cerebral palsy			1
mrs @entity10 said : ‘ up until 20 weeks it had been a normal pregnancy but then they noticed a problem with @entity13 's growth			0
‘ he was not keeping up with @entity12 so they wanted to keep a closer eye on me			2
’ she added : ‘ when @entity12 was diagnosed i took it in my stride because i was prepared			1
i knew he would need extra care and would need physiotherapy and possibly surgery			0
‘ it was @entity69 that caused @entity12 's cerebral palsy			2
it could have been triggered by lack of oxygen			0
they ca n't tell me what caused the @entity69 but it was a traumatic birth so it may have been that			1
’ the boys ' parents are trying to raise £ 75,000 to allow @entity12 to have pioneering surgery in @entity9 paediatric neurosurgeon dr @entity98 will carry out a @entity99 ( @entity100 ) procedure at the @entity102 in @entity103 cerebral palsy affects the communication between the brain and the muscles , causing the muscles in @entity12 's legs to receive constant messages to tighten and contract			1
this means that he is unable to walk of crawl			2
however , in june he will travel to @entity9 for pioneering surgery to address the problem			1
paediatric neurosurgeon dr @entity98 will carry out a @entity99 ( @entity100 ) procedure at the @entity102 in @entity103			0
the operation will involve examining the sensory nerve fibres that enter the spinal cord from the muscles , and removing the abnormal ' rootlets ' that cause his disability			1
the operation will involve examining the sensory nerve fibres that enter the spinal cord from the muscles , and removing the abnormal ' rootlets ' that cause his disability mr and mrs @entity10 found out about the procedure because another child at their local hospital had it and improved dramatically as a result the procedure reduces the number of messages sent from the muscles and gives a better balance of nerve cell activity in the spinal cord			1
to pay for the procedure and the stay in @entity9 , @entity12 ’s parents have launched a fundraising campaign raise £ 75,000			1
they have so far raised £ 35,000			0
mrs @entity10 said : ‘ @entity12 is already starting to notice the differences between what he and @entity13 can do			2
‘ surgeons in the @entity145 would not look at @entity12 until he was four and a half , and they would n't operate until he was five			1
in the @entity145 , @entity12 ( right ) would not be eligible for surgery until he was five - years - old ‘ the younger they get the operation the better			1
i do n't want him to grow up feeling different to his twin			0
‘ @entity13 can sit , crawl , walk , run , get himself up and down stairs			2
@entity12 has no mobility at all without being assisted			2
‘ he can sit on the floor if he is supported but he ca n't crawl or kneel			1
she added : ‘ sometimes he is cheeky with it			0
he will sit and tilt his head at you then throws himself back on the floor and start laughing			0
‘ he is such a good boy			0
ninety per cent of the time he is happy			0
he can wake up during the night and have tightness in his legs			0
that 's when he gets upset			0
it is thought that the boys ' traumatic birth may have caused @entity12 to have periventricular leukomalacia ( @entity69 ) - a type of brain injury which can lead to cerebral palsy @entity13 ( pictured ) is completely healthy despite being born so early ‘ as far as everything else goes , he 's fine			1
his speech is actually better than his brother 's			0
’ @entity12 has frequent hospital appointments and follows a strict regime of physiotherapy to build up his core muscles			1
his parents found out about the @entity100 operation when another young patient at the @entity184 underwent it and experienced a massive improvement			0
they researched the surgery then contacted the @entity102 hospital and sent doctors a video of @entity12 to see whether he would be a suitable candidate			1
he was approved , and the couple began a fundraising campaign called @entity193			0
they will travel to @entity9 for a pre-surgery assessment in june , followed by the operation three days later .			2

@entity12 and @entity24 were born three months prematurely
@entity12 was diagnosed with @entity18 as a baby
he ca n't walk or crawl because the muscles in his legs constantly spasm
his parents need to raise £ 75,000 to allow him to have surgery in the @entity9
surgeons will remove abnormal sensory nerve fibres from his spinal cord
