by @entity0 for @entity1 @entity2 , @entity3 and @entity4 have more in common than wealth , beauty , style and success			1
the a-list trio all share a deep passion for wholesome living - and they credit their daily meditation , powerful chakras and positive affirmations for keeping them sane in an industry prone to self - destruction			1
thanks to the glossy stars , mindfulness and clean living , which were once perceived as reserved for ' hippy ' and ' bohemian ' types , have become synonyms with success , fortune and , quite frankly , all things cool			2
the a-list way : a new retreat at @entity30 teaches mindfulness , mediation , and yoga loved by @entity2 , left , and @entity4 @entity2 is the postergirl for positive living - she has even penned two self - help books , @entity37 and @entity38 , packed with uplifting affirmations , while @entity3 keeps her crystals on hand at all times when preparing for fashion shows			1
and it 's not just supermodels and fashionistas at it			0
@entity48 , who established the hugely successful @entity49 , credits daily mindfulness and meditation for changing her life			1
meanwhile , @entity53 puts his success , in part , down to positive affirmations and visualisation			0
but can mere mortals incorporate these beliefs and practises into their daily life and create a living as alluring , lucrative and , seemingly , as fulfilling as the world 's most powerful ? @entity63 and @entity64 , who have launched a programme at @entity30 based around these principles , think so and believe that if we all acted a little more like @entity2 , the world would be a better place			1
retreat : @entity63 and @entity64 are running a course , which is called bring yourself back into your life , and aims to help people discover how to put yourself in control of your life , at luxury health retreat @entity30 facilities : in between the hourly sessions , guests are treated to all the usual luxuries that @entity30 offers , including a @entity83 pool session , which claims to help beat cellulite , pictured @entity63 and @entity64 are hosting weekend retreats within the luxurious grounds of @entity87 with the intent of helping people find themselves and put themselves back into their lives using the techniques and practises that the most successful of a-listers employ on a daily basis			1
' our retreats aim to help you facilitate your ongoing transformation , growth and empowerment			0
we will work with you on your energy levels of awareness , self - assessment and self - healing and teach you energy management using meditation giving you the skills to take control of your life and your future , ' the couple from @entity101 say			1
@entity63 and @entity64 's course , which is called bring yourself back into your life , aims to help people discover how to put yourself in control of your life , learn who you are , how to create a positive reality and be aware of the negative influences in your life			0
the duo aim to help guests find inner peace - that quiet place so rarely experienced in today ’s stressful world - via mindfulness and meditation			1
and what better place to host it than at @entity30 , which was the vision of @entity129 , who over 85 years ago pioneered the concept of holistic wellbeing , creating a place where people could escape the world ’s cares and re-emerge revitalised			1
revamp : while the property is currently undergoing major refurbishment , the bedrooms have been given a makeovera unrivalled views of rolling green hills ( 170 acres worth to be precise ) sleep , meditation and mindfulness are vital skills taught on the course and three things that entrepreneur @entity48 , who describes herself as a ' sleep evangelist ' , swears by			1
having trouble switching off or need a little ' me time ' in the middle of a hectic day ? @entity63 and @entity64 believe meditation and mindfulness are essential			1
' we do n't call it meditation , but rather " sitting " ' , says @entity64			1
so how do you do it without getting distracted by thoughts of what to have for dinner ? ' sit comfortably , close your eyes and focus on your breath , ' advises @entity64			0
' meditation teaches you to manage your energy : to know how to respond spontaneously to any situation , when to allow your emotions to flow , when to suppress them , and to know the condition of your body			1
above all , it enables you to take time out from the relentless activity of your mind , and shows you how to reach a place of peace whenever and wherever you choose			0
' however little you can fit into your day is useful , pop to the toilet for five minutes twice a day and sit quietly			0
if distracting thoughts pop into your head , acknowledge them and let them pass			0
there are some great apps for guided meditation out there if you find it hard to do it alone			2
next time you ca n't get to sleep , meditate for thirty minutes instead of reading a book or watching tv ; you 'll really notice the benefits			2
' visualisation , also known as @entity192 , is a technique that has been proven to be extraordinarily successful in producing a specific outcome and is another key skill taught on the course			0
make like @entity2 : sleep , meditation and mindfulness are vital skills taught on the course and there 's daily yoga sessions on offer too ' the next time you achieve something you 're really proud of , make a note of what it feels like and conjure up that exact feeling when you need a little boost of confidence			1
it will get you in to the right mindset , ' says @entity64			0
want proof that it works ? just ask @entity53 ( a.k.a the real @entity217 who was a multi-millionaire by the age of 26 and was played by @entity220 in this year 's most talked - about movie )			2
he used visualisation before every important business meeting throughout his career			0
@entity63 and @entity64 also teach guests the power of their @entity227 - or spinning ' wheels ' of energy located at seven points in the body			2
' @entity227 help to maintain your physical , mental , emotional and spiritual balance			0
@entity235 crystal gems , colours and scents are often used in @entity238 , ' said @entity64			0
while some find the notion of this a little far - fetched , @entity3 recently revealed her ‘ weird ’ ritual of using crystals backstage at her fashion shows , specifically @entity244 and @entity245 , to balance her chakras			2
famous fan : @entity2 , who has penned two self - help books , swears by the power of yoga and mindfulness and practises every morning well , if it works for her ! @entity3 recently revealed her ' weird ' ritual of using crystals backstage at her fashion shows , specifically @entity244 and @entity245 see it to believe it : @entity53 ( a.k.a the real @entity217 who was a multi-millionaire by the age of 26 and was played by @entity220 in this year 's most talked - about movie ) used visualisation before every important business meeting throughout his career - it sure worked revealing the rituals she credits for her success , the former @entity265 said : ‘ if i told you my backstage rituals , and was honest you would think i was a little weird			1
i carry my crystals with me which some people might think as odd but it works for us			0
’ the rocks are popular among many celebrities including @entity276 and @entity277 who believe they have healing powers , although there is no basis in science			0
in between the hourly sessions , guests are treated to all the usual luxuries that @entity30 offers , including a @entity83 pool session , which claims to help beat cellulite , and indulgent massages and facials using the super luxe @entity289 and @entity291 ranges			1
there are also plenty of exercise classes on offer from high intensity spin to relaxing hatha yoga , and enough surrounding gardens to while away an afternoon if crashing out is more appealing than working out			2
while the property is currently undergoing major refurbishment ( some of the changing facilities could use some work and a good scrub ) , the newly revamped bedrooms have unrivalled views of rolling green hills ( 170 acres worth to be precise ) and the spa , which is packed with 60 treatment rooms , is top notch			0
health kick : food wise , eating like a supermodel is a prerequisite here			0
the day starts with a green shot ( a potent concoction of cucumber , spinach , lime and pear ) - and ends with flaxseed pizzas food wise , eating like a supermodel is a prerequisite here			2
the day starts with a green shot ( a potent concoction of cucumber , spinach , lime and pear ) - and ends with flaxseed pizzas			2
portion sizes are , however , generous and if it 's going to give you skin to rival @entity4 - who credits her daily ' delicious green juice ' for leaving her bright eyed and bushy tailed - then hold your nose , knock it back , and let it work its magic			1
several green juices down and armed with the ' tools ' loved by @entity2 and her glossy pals , you 'll feel ready to take on the world , one meditation session at a time			1
the weekend , which includes two nights ' accommodation , costs from £ 349.00 per person at @entity349 and @entity350 .			0
