by @entity0 published : 06:12 est , 20 february 2013 updated : 21:02 est , 20 february 2013 when he bought it for £ 6,500 , it was little more than a shack to shelter in while he worked as a lifeguard			1

he did little with it for much of that time , but after marrying and moving further along the coast to @entity43 , he and his new wife @entity30 decided to invest £ 100,000 to create a luxury bolthole			2
they now rent out the retreat all year round for between £ 1,500 and £ 2,900 a week			1
with an occupancy rate of 80 per cent , the annual return should be around £ 100,000			2

‘ i lived in it for 18 months ... and nearly got blown away with it a few times			2
i left it as it was for 25 years and could n’t really afford to do anything with it			0
it has only been the last 18 months that we managed to get the funding and planning permission in place that we could really do something with it			0
eco-friendly : the chalet measures 23ft by 13ft and has been made out of eco-friendly cedar wood inside : along with being well insulated , the building has underfloor heating and triple - glazed windows ambitions : the couple hope to buy another chalet nearby and transform it into a holiday let geared up for families worth it : mr @entity8 said : ' people are happy to pay the rental price for it because of the views and the high standard finish ' ‘ we are delighted with how it has turned out			1

previously : how the old shack looked before it was demolished and turned into the luxury retreat bargain : mr @entity8 bought the shack , pictured before it was renovated , for £ 6,500 while working as a lifeguard on the beach below demolition : mr @entity8 clearing the old shack before work began on the new chalet underway : mr @entity8 admires the view as the construction of the new building begins to take shape building work : the couple spent £ 100,000 rebuilding the hut , which they now rent out to holidaymakers bidders will have the chance to own a piece of the @entity151 coast when an historic four - mile stretch goes under the hammer			1

the land , which includes pockets of woodland and is a @entity164 , belongs to @entity165 , former senior partner of @entity166 , who bought it from the @entity168 around 18 months ago			0
mr @entity165 has sold much of the surrounding land locally , but the five areas of foreshore remain ' superfluous ' and @entity172 auctioneer @entity173 has been tasked with selling them			0
mr @entity173 said nearby former crown plots of one acre to one - and - a - half - acres have sold for between £ 2,000 and £ 4,000			2
he said the title of the land dates back to @entity178 , who gave it to the first baron le @entity180 - whose family owned large amounts of land in @entity184 during the 12th and 13th centuries			0
but he said no matter the outcome , public access to the foreshore can not be impeded , and the owner can not remove the shingles or fence from the land			0
ownership would give the highest bidder powers such as the authority to move on a travelling community or exercise the 28 - day rule - which would allow them to reside on the land for up to a maximum of 28 days			0
the experienced auctioneer said he had never sold anything like this in almost half a century in the profession			0
' it 's a beauty spot , it 's a pretty place in a lovely location and it 's a very unusual sale , ' said mr @entity173			0
' in 46 years of professional auctioneering , i 've never been asked to sell anything like this and i do n't think i ever will again			0
