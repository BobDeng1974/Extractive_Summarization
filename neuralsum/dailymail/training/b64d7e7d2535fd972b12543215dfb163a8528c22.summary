by @entity0 published : 06:28 est , 9 may 2012 updated : 11:28 est , 9 may 2012 a camera trap in @entity2 caught video footage of the world 's rarest gorilla - capturing a group of eight @entity8 gorillas casually making their way along a forest path			1
with fewer than 250 individuals remaining , @entity8 gorillas are the world 's rarest gorilla and a notoriously elusive species rarely observed directly by field researchers			1
' this video gives us all a spectacular view into the hidden world of one of our closest relatives , which is in dire need of our help to survive , ' said @entity26 , @entity26 president and ceo			0
' @entity33 , director of @entity34 , added : ' the video represents the best images to date of @entity8 gorillas , normally shy animals that flee at the slightest hint of human presence			1
' the footage provides us with our first tantalizing glimpses of @entity8 gorillas behaving normally in their environment			1
a person can study these animals for years and never even catch a glimpse of the gorillas , much less see anything like this			0
' at one point , a male silverback appears , surveying the area ( and perhaps aware of the camera ) before running past the camera lens giving a classic ' chest - beating ' display			0
another gorilla ( appearing in the footage at around 1:18 in the sequence ) appears to be missing a hand , a healed injury but a disquieting indicator of the presence of snares within the family group 's range in the past before increased patrolling in the now - protected area			0
' @entity8 gorillas occur in very low densities across their entire range , so the appearance of a possible snare injury is a reminder that continued law enforcement efforts are needed to prevent further injuries to gorillas in the sanctuary , ' said dr. @entity79 , @entity80 for @entity26 's @entity81			1
at one point , a male turns towards camera and is clearly visible the @entity84 was established by the government of @entity2 in 2008 for the sole purpose of protecting the @entity8 gorilla			2
the sanctuary is now managed by a conservator ( chief warden ) assisted by two ecoguards , all appointed by the @entity93 ( @entity94 ) , and a strong team of local staff from the eight villages near the protected area			0
@entity99 is the only site where daily monitoring of @entity8 gorilla movements takes place			2
' spectacular footage such as this , which we 've never had before for @entity8 gorillas , is absolutely vital to inspire local people , the governments of @entity105 and @entity2 , and the global community to care about and to save this unique subspecies , ' said dr. @entity112 , executive director for @entity26 's @entity113			1
' continued research of this kind will help fine - tune management plans to protect this rarest of apes			0
' the @entity8 gorilla is the rarest of the four subspecies of gorilla , with fewer than 250 individuals remaining across its entire range , limited to the remote forested mountainous terrain on the border region of @entity105 and @entity2			2
the subspecies is listed as ' @entity128 ' and is threatened by both habitat destruction and hunting , as the entire population lives in a region of high human population density and heavy natural resource exploitation			0
local community residents in the area surrounding @entity99 do not directly hunt @entity8 gorillas due to traditional beliefs , but they do set snares for other forest animals , and these could occasionally injure gorillas .			2

fewer than 250 @entity8 gorillas survive
