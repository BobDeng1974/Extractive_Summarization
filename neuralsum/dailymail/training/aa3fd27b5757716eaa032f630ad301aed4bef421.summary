@entity0 proclaimed the message loud and clear : they are sick and tired of life in the championship			1
they believe they are good enough for the @entity4 and they intend to return there as quickly as possible			0
here they showed why and how			0
this was a very polished performance against one of their promotion rivals			0
@entity12 are usually so assured on the road , here they looked lost			1
@entity14 ( centre ) wheels away after opening the scoring in @entity0 's defeat of @entity12 @entity0 : @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity24 ( @entity25 71 ) , @entity26 ( @entity27 52 ) , @entity28 , @entity29 ( @entity30 82 ) , @entity14 , @entity31 substitutes not used : @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35 scorers : @entity14 24 ; @entity28 45 +2 booked : @entity31 @entity12 : @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 ( @entity40 62 ) , @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 ( @entity44 46 ) , @entity45 , @entity46 , reach , @entity47 , @entity48 ( @entity49 62 ) substitutes not used : @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 booked : @entity48 , @entity39 , friend referee : @entity55 ( @entity56 ) attendance : 21,187 ( 1,111 away ) in the end , two goals were ample			1
if @entity61 ’s team do make their return to the top flight , @entity14 ’s contribution will have been priceless			2
he rifled home midway through the first - half and @entity28 made it two on the stroke of half - time			1
they could easily have scored more but the point had been made			0
after 12 years away from the top division , @entity0 feel another crack at it is long overdue			2
the win was n’t sufficient to take them top for @entity77 - @entity76 ’s seaside stroll at @entity78 put paid to that - but second place , a mere point behind , will do very nicely			2
this constantly fluctuating @entity83 promotion race had taken another twist at lunchtime , with @entity87 ’s last - gasp goal for @entity88 at @entity89 doing their @entity90 rivals a small favour			1
it meant both of these teams had the chance to go top , though leaders @entity76 were unlikely to surrender first place by faltering at strugglers @entity78			0
that proved correct , the @entity98 cruised to victory			0
@entity28 ( left ) celebrates after the @entity0 midfielder put the home side 2 - 0 ahead just before the break whatever the complex permutations , something had to give here			1
@entity0 had won seven of their 10 home league matches this season , while @entity12 had won six of their last nine on the road			1
while @entity113 ’s side had lost just one of their last 16 , @entity61 ’s had been defeated in just one of 17			2
with so much at stake , it was perhaps understandably a cagey opening with the only real chance of the opening 20 minutes arriving when @entity29 fired over after a deft touch brought him infield from the left			0
the hosts had been the better team on the balance of play and their 24th - minute lead was just about deserved			0
they profited down the left side when @entity24 threaded a pass to @entity28 , who advanced to the byline			2
his cut - back fell perfectly for @entity31 , only for his strike to be blocked by the legs of @entity37			1
the ball ricocheted nicely for @entity14 to drill home his 14th goal of the campaign			1
@entity12 had to play on the counter-attack but @entity139 and @entity45 looked effective at times			2
a searching ball over the top by @entity142 was just beyond the outstretched leg of @entity144			0
@entity142 , who had earlier been cautioned for a foul on @entity31 , appeared to bring the @entity0 striker down again after being turned in the box			1
referee @entity55 disagreed and booked @entity31 for diving			2
@entity0 boss @entity61 shouts some orders from the sidelines during his side 's 2 - 0 victory @entity12 ’s best chance of the opening half arrived four minutes before the break			1
reach found himself in plenty of space to cross from the left and @entity43 flicked a header wide of the far post			0
it was an opportunity they would regret not taking			0
in the second minute of added time , following a fine exchange of passes down the right involving @entity31 , @entity170 and @entity24 , the latter swung in a cross and @entity28 - all 5ft 7in of him - somehow got between two burly defenders to head home			1
@entity113 introduced @entity44 at the break to try and spur his team into life but @entity0 had the first chance of the second - half when @entity20 headed straight at @entity37 from @entity29 ’s free - kick			1
@entity142 was fortunate not to see red when he scissored down the advancing @entity29 wide right and @entity113 wisely replaced the defender moments later			0
home keeper @entity19 had not put a foot wrong but he was stranded when @entity139 tried to lob him from 30 yards out			0
@entity22 recognised the danger and read the trajectory to head off the line			0
@entity0 were starting to showboat by the midway point and they really should have made it three - from @entity28 ’s corner , a @entity14 header was blocked on the line by @entity45 and @entity21 then struck the post with the follow - up			1
it did n’t matter , @entity12 had produced precious little			2
the points had long been secure after this statement of a performance .			0

@entity0 defeated @entity12 2 - 0 in their @entity83 clash
@entity14 opened the scoring after a rebound from @entity31
@entity28 headed home @entity204 's cross on the stroke of half - time
