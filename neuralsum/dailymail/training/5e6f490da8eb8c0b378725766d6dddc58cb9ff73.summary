the landscape for dating has changed a little since the days of @entity2 with many of us turning to match - making websites and apps such as @entity7 in hope of finding true love			1
however , one young singleton was determined to bring a bit of old - fashioned romance back to online dating			2
lifestyle website @entity14 set one of its writers , @entity16 , the hilarious task of using some of history 's greatest love letters as the script for @entity7 conversations with potential new dates			1
love online : many of us now use dating websites and apps such as @entity7 while looking for a relationship some of the letters used as the basis for conversation included those to @entity33 from @entity34 during @entity35 and entries in @entity38 's diary dedicated to her lover @entity39			1
once @entity16 had her conversations ( mainly ending in being blocked ) she then rated her potential suitors out of ten and gave the lessons that she learnt from each man			2
the results range from the completely outraged to the surprisingly charming and for some guys the clincher still remains on what football team you support			2
@entity50 to @entity51 , 1943 @entity50 wrote this in a touching letter to a @entity51 of @entity54 , @entity55 while he was away during @entity35 it is one of the many love letters @entity59 wrote to his future wife to have survived because she kept it in her engagement scrapbook – the others were lost in one of their many later moves			1
that 's the problem with love letters – there 's no backing - up system			1
straight to the point : @entity16 appeared to scare off her prospective date when she discussed having children so early on in their conversation original letter : ' this should be a very easy letter to write — words should come easily and in short it should be simple for me to tell you how desperately happy i was to open the paper and see the announcement of our engagement , but somehow i ca n't possibly say all in a letter i should like to			1
i love you , precious , with all my heart and to know that you love me means my life			1
how often i have thought about the immeasurable joy that will be ours some day			2
how lucky our children will be to have a mother like you ... ' @entity92 @entity93 : hi @entity16 :-) @entity16 : how lucky our children will be to have a father like you j : haha indeed s : how often i have thought about the immeasurable joy that will be ours some day j : ok … where based ? you * s : @entity104 , @entity105 j : that 's quite far away lol i 'm in @entity108 s : i love you , precious , with all my heart and to know that you love me means my life hopeless romantic			1
@entity34 would write to his wife @entity33 while he was away during @entity35 two j : great you sure you 're not a bot s : fairly j : when you coming to meet me then ? s : i ca n't possibly say all i should like to j : what team do you support ? s : @entity117			2
you ? j : spurs [ blocks me ] rating : 6/10 lessons : it looks like @entity7 is responsive to romance @entity34 - style ( lol ) , but is definitely not ok with you supporting the wrong football team			1
oscar wilde to lord @entity127 , 1897 love letters between @entity126 and lord @entity127 were eventually read out in the court case that saw @entity126 serve two years for indecency and sodomy			1
this letter to his lover of six years was written just after @entity126 was released from prison and had fled to @entity136			2
@entity127 , who was known as ' @entity137 ' to his friends , had a tempestuous relationship and would often argue and break up , but would always reconcile			0
deep conversation : the confused @entity7 user tries to decipher the @entity126 quotes used in this exchange original letter ' everyone is furious with me for going back to you , but they do n't understand us			1
i feel that it is only with you that i can do anything at all			0
do remake my ruined life for me , and then our friendship and love will have a different meaning to the world			1
i wish that when we met at @entity158 we had not parted at all			0
there are such wide abysses now of space and land between us			0
but we love each other			2
' @entity92 @entity164 : how are you ? s : do remake my ruined life for me m : would love to what 's happened ? s : there are such wide abysses now of space and land between us m : how long have you been single ? old fashioned love : @entity126 with his lover lord @entity127 who he used to write to , his letters were eventually used against him in court that saw him spend two years in prison for indecency s : i feel like it is only with you that i can do anything at all m : what would you like to do ? s : meet at @entity158 ? m : where 's @entity158 ? s : in @entity136 on the @entity188 m : lovely rating : 10/10 lessons : we 'll get back to you on that one once we 're back from @entity158 @entity38 and @entity39 , 1940s this is only one of numerous love letters @entity38 addressed to @entity39 in the diary she kept during the 1940s			1
it speaks of the deep and abiding bond the couple had despite several infidelities ( on both sides ) and a brief divorce			0
confused : this potential @entity7 date seems utterly baffled by the topic of conversation original letter ' nothing compares to your hands , nothing like the green - gold of your eyes			1
my body is filled with you for days and days			0
you are the mirror of the night			0
the violent flash of lightning			0
the dampness of the earth			0
the hollow of your armpits is my shelter			0
my fingers touch your blood			0
all my joy is to feel life spring from your flower - fountain that mine keeps to fill all the paths of my nerves which are yours			0
' @entity92 @entity230 : hey you ( smiley face ) s : you are the mirror of the night			0
the violent flash of lightning			0
the dampness of the earth			0
n : huh ? ! ( embarrassed face ) secret love : @entity38 wrote her letters to @entity39 in the diary she kept during the 1940s s : the hollow of your armpit is my shelter n : hahahahahahahahaha wtf are you on ? s : my fingers touch your blood [ @entity250 ] rating : 2/10 lessons : no matter how intense and painterly you 'd like your romance to become , probably best not to mention either blood or armpits within the first ten minutes of meeting someone on @entity7			1
