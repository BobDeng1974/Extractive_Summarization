by @entity0 published : 03:43 est , 16 october 2012 updated : 04:02 est , 16 october 2012 a nurse has admitted administering ten times the correct dose of salt to a baby who later died but denied falling asleep on duty			1
after the overdose , four - month - old @entity6 suffered fatal brain damage and died at a hospital in @entity10 in july 2009			1
just days before the blunder , staff nurse @entity12 , 35 , posted a picture of herself appearing to be asleep next to the baby on @entity16 , without the consent of the hospital or parents , a medical tribunal heard yesterday			1
posted on @entity16 : nurse @entity12 appears to be asleep next to @entity21 's cot in intensive care days before he died of an overdose at a hospital in @entity10 in 2009 intensive care : @entity6 had been born prematurely at @entity10 's @entity26 and weighed around a sixth of the normal weight for a full - term baby an inquest into the death the year after the incident had heard that two nurses , who were involved in a ' dreadful mistake ' which led to the death , could not explain how the error occurred			1
the inquest heard that sister @entity38 and @entity12 were ' distracted ' by another staff member as they prepared a solution to correct @entity6 ’s low salt levels			1
as a result of the mistake , @entity6 was wrongly given 50ml of a sodium chloride solution despite a registrar prescribing just 5ml			2
tests conducted on a syringe after the mistake was spotted showed that the sodium chloride had also not been mixed with dextrose , as required by the prescription			0
the error meant the infusion given to @entity6 was ten times the required concentration , causing swelling to his brain from which he died			1
yesterday the @entity56 heard mrs @entity12 , who was not present for the hearing , had admitted administering an overdose of sodium chloride to @entity6 ( @entity60 )			1
she admitted that the overdose related to a concentration of sodium chloride approximately 10 times that expected from the prescription			0
she has also admitted posting on @entity16 , on or around june 23 , 2009 , a photo of herself on duty at the @entity68 , and the baby			1
this was without the consent of the @entity68 , or the baby ’s parents			0
she denies charges that on the nightshift of june 22 - 23 , 2009 , she fell asleep while on duty , and that she appeared to be asleep in the photo			2
a fitness to practice panel is to consider whether her alleged actions amounted to misconduct and if her fitness to practise is impaired			0
if found guilty of misconduct she could be kicked out of the profession			0
at the earlier inquest , @entity86 , the solicitor acting for @entity6 ’s parents @entity84 and @entity85 , urged the @entity89 , dr @entity90 , to consider a verdict of unlawful killing			2
but dr @entity90 recorded a narrative verdict after ruling that @entity6 died after a ' drug error ' on the high dependency unit at @entity10 's @entity97 ( @entity97 )			2
he said there was no doubt that a dreadful mistake had taken place , but ruled that it did not fall into the category of a gross failure			0
@entity85 , left and @entity105 , right , both pictured with their baby @entity6 before he died sister @entity38 , who was in charge of the unit , told the inquest that she had no clear memory of what she actually did			1
there had been ' a bit of an interruption ' , she said			0
mrs @entity12 told the inquest she could not recall opening five 10ml vials of sodium chloride , saying : ' nothing occurred to me at all that we had made an error			2
' @entity6 had been born prematurely at @entity10 ’s @entity26 on march 1 , 2009 , and weighed 1lb 4oz - around a sixth of the normal weight for a full - term baby			1
he was given a 25 per cent chance of survival			0
he was transferred to the @entity97 aged 18 days to receive intensive care and by june there was talk of him going home			1
but he became unwell again on july 4 and after blood tests it was discovered that his sodium chloride levels were low and he was put on a course of fluid infusion			0
@entity6 pictured at one day old			2
aged 18 days he was transferred hospital and he was expected to survive @entity6 was prescribed three milimoles of the fluid infusion per kilogram per day			1
but his sodium chloride levels remained low and after observations it was decided to give him a separate salt solution infusion			0
it was then that mrs @entity12 made a ‘ catastrophic drug administration error ’ by giving him the fatal overdose			2
as a result , by 3.40am he had lost 340grams of weight , 12.5 per cent of his body weight , and was suffering swelling to his brain			0
@entity152 , speaking for the @entity56 , said : ‘ over the next 24 hours @entity60 remained significantly unwell			0
@entity10 's @entity97 where @entity6 was transferred to aged 18 days to receive intensive care ‘ he remained ventilated and he received fluids to correct his sodium level			1
‘ @entity156 had a decreased consciousness level and persistent seizures			0
‘ his sodium level gradually improved , however , there was no improvement in the neurological status			0
’ two days later @entity6 ’s heart stopped and he had to be resuscitated			2
at this point doctors determined that the damage caused to this brain was ‘ non-survivable ’			0
@entity6 ’s parents were told and a joint decision was taken to stop his intensive care @entity169 died at 11am on july 7 , 2009 , sparking a trust investigation			1
