drugs such as low - dose aspirin would be more effective if timed with the body ’s natural rhythms , new research says many popular pills – including some cholesterol - busting statins – would be better taken at night than in the morning , scientists believe			1
they say widely - used tablets such as low - dose aspirin would be more effective if timed with the body ’s natural rhythms			1
scientists showed that individual genes are governed by the body clock and become more or less active at certain times of the day			1
they found that nearly half of all mouse genes work harder at some points in the 24 - hour cycle than others , with ‘ rush hours ’ of activity just before dawn and dusk			1
although the study was on mice , most mouse genes have ‘ twins ’ in humans			1
many common drugs home in on these genes and so should be most effective when the genes are most active			1
this is particularly important in the case of medicines such as aspirin , which are broken down quickly by the body			1
the @entity37 study found 56 of the 100 best - selling drugs in the @entity40 act on genes that ebb and flow over the day			1
similarly , 119 of the 250 pills on the @entity47 ’s list of essential medicines may work better at a certain time of the day , the journal @entity44 reports			1
@entity37 ’s pharmacology professor @entity50 said more work is needed to say when is the best time to take each pill			2
however , research already shows that low - dose aspirin , taken daily by millions of @entity55 who have survived a heart attack or stroke to keep their blood thin , is best taken at night			0
this ensures the drug has time to work before morning – the peak time for heart attacks			2
likewise , simvastatin , one of the most widely - used cholesterol - lowering statin pills , should also be taken at bedtime			0
this is because the drug works by blocking a key step in the production of cholesterol , and the gene behind this step is most active at night			2
patients are already told to take simvastatin in the evening , however many still take it at the wrong time			0
some will take the drug in the morning to prevent them forgetting			0
individual genes are governed by the body clock and become more or less active at certain times of the day			1
many common drugs home in on these genes – and so should be most effective if given when the genes are most active , say @entity40 researchers professor @entity50 said : ‘ there ’s a huge opportunity for improving the action of existing drugs through better timing			1
’ @entity91 , of the @entity92 , said : ‘ simvastatin … is best taken at bedtime as your liver makes most of your cholesterol at night			0
‘ low - dose aspirin works by making your blood less sticky			0
there is research that says more heart attacks occur in the morning , so … reducing this stickiness by the morning could help prevent heart attacks			0
’ women are putting their lives at risk by ignoring the symptoms of heart disease , researchers warn			0
many brush pain off as indigestion or a pulled muscle and wait days or weeks before seeing a doctor			0
but in fact it could be a symptom of angina , where one of the arteries to the heart gets blocked , or a mild heart attack			0
@entity123 researchers urge women not to assume heart attacks are a ‘ man ’s disease ’ and to seek help			0
statistically , women are less likely to have a heart attack than men before the menopause , but afterwards they overtake them and are more at risk			0
furthermore , heart attacks in women tend to be more severe than in men – possibly because they have ignored the warning signs			2
lead author dr @entity139 , of the @entity140 , said : ‘ both men and women go into a phase of denial – but women seem to stay in this stage longer			2
