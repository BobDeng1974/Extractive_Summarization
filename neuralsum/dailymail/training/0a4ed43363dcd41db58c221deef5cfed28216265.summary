’ @entity4 mp @entity10 , a practising gp , said people who eat doughnuits for breakfast should be charged for their prescriptions if they later develop diabetes ( file image ) @entity4 mp and gp @entity10 said most patients these days were suffering from lifestyle - related illnesses that could bankrupt the @entity15 dr @entity10 also warned that members of the ‘ baby boomer ’ generation were less ‘ stoical ’ than their parents – with potentially disastrous consequences for the finances of the @entity15			1
he said there a ‘ stark difference ’ between the way in which those in their eighties dealt with pain , compared to those in their late sixties and early seventies			2
dr @entity10 said the majority of patients he saw were now suffering from illnesses caused by their lifestyles , or complaining of conditions that their forebears would have suffered in silence			1
he suggested ministers should study the system used in @entity59 where individuals are allocated a ‘ modest ’ annual drugs budget , after which they are expected to pay for their own prescriptions			0
and he said charging people for the cost of their prescriptions would encourage them to take more responsibility for their own health			1
‘ if you want to have doughnuts for breakfast , fine , but there is a cost implication down the line , ’ he said			2
‘ we need to match actions to consequences – at the moment that does not happen in this country			0
’ dr @entity10 said people had to take more responsibility for their own health politicians have traditionally fought shy of telling people to take responsibility for their own health , because of fears of a public backlash			1

he warned that only socialist @entity90 attempted to maintain a healthcare system on the same line as the @entity93 ’s			0
he went on : ‘ we have got to be bold here , we have got to be decided that the @entity95 in its current form is not sustainable			0
‘ it probably can limp on for the rest of this decade but the reality is the pressures coming from the baby boomer generation and their expectations of health care , their perceptions of pain and suffering is profoundly different to their stoic parents who survived the war			0
" ‘ it 's time we actually got quite realistic about this because if we do n't we are going to lose what most people would want in this country which is access to care when you need it irrespective of your means			0
‘ in which case , if we do n't start reforming now and actually accepting that the way @entity122 designed it in post-war stoic @entity93 has got to change then we are going to end up with collapse and the free for all and the pretty disgraceful situation you find in the @entity129			0
’ dr @entity10 said £ 400 million could be saved from the drugs budget by allowing @entity11 surgeries to dispense medicines			1
