town hall chiefs are defying the government and launching cctv spy cars even after they were told the ' cash cows ' will be made illegal , @entity0 can reveal			1
local government secretary @entity5 has announced he will ban the controversial vehicles , which film people breaking traffic rules and send them fines of up to £ 130 in the post			1
yet since his pledge in september , 20 authorities - including one of the country 's biggest , @entity14 - have either introduced a new spy car regime or have firm plans to do so			1
on the lookout : last september , communities secretary @entity5 condemned the use of @entity20 against drivers as a ' step too far '			1
but councils have simply ignored him - with 20 authorities so far buying new spy cars another 38 councils have had meetings about the controversial technology in the last year , and have yet to reveal if they will introduce it			1
about a fifth of authorities in @entity32 and @entity33 now use @entity20 cars despite complaints by motorists , ministers and civil liberties groups			1
local government secretary @entity5 said councils used @entity20 on an ' industrial scale ' they handed drivers more than 340,000 fines worth at least £ 30 million in the last year			1
yet of the 2,500 drivers who appealed to an independent tribunal , almost half ( 44 per cent ) won their cases			2
some 697 won outright while another 379 had their cases dropped by the council once they mounted a formal challenge			0
mr @entity5 said : ' @entity20 spy cars are just an excuse for councils to raise money from issuing parking fines on an industrial scale			1
' they undermine natural justice , as car owners receive the fine weeks later in the post making it extremely hard to challenge on appeal			0
this is why the government has published proposals to ban @entity20 being used for parking purposes			0
' we are going to rein in the town hall parking bullies			0
' @entity0 obtained the figures by sending @entity71 requests to 373 councils , of which 296 replied within the legal deadline			0
we asked about @entity20 car use between november 2012 and the end of october 2013 , and asked if councils which did not run the technology had held meetings about it or made firm plans to introduce it			0
five authorities - @entity14 , @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity84 and @entity85 – said they had already launched @entity20 cars in the time between mr @entity5 ' landmark announcement on september 27 and the end of october			1
another 15 areas had made firm plans to do so , with many claiming they were inundated with requests for @entity20 from the public			0
we 're watching you : @entity20 cars were legalised in 2004 and there are now more than 100 in use across @entity97 only one of the 15 , @entity99 in @entity100 , said it was delaying introducing the cars until the government released firm guidance			1
cllr @entity104 , @entity14 ’s cabinet member for the environment , defended the technology			0
with more than 100 specially adapted cars across @entity97 , ' mobile cctv ' has become the bane of many motorists ' lives			1
the technology was legalised under @entity112 in 2004 , allowing councils to break from the tradition of always using traffic wardens			2
since then more councils have brought in the technology every year - but while a traffic warden can be reasoned with , said critics , a machine can not			1
high - profile ' victims ' included one driver who pulled over to vomit and another whose windscreen had smashed			0
drivers who feel they have been wronged can take their cases to a @entity126 , a network of independent adjudicators , or a parallel system for @entity130			0
adjudicators often criticise councils and have questioned their definition of the ' difficult or sensitive ' circumstances in which @entity20 fines should be given out			2
@entity136 , south west @entity130 , faced having to repay thousands of fines in 2011 after campaigner @entity138 discovered its four cars had not been properly registered			2
she said : ' parents , teachers and children regularly tell us that illegal parking on roads outside schools is a major problem			0
' despite their efforts to urge people to park more responsibly , a minority of motorists still persist in putting the lives of school children at risk			0
' these clearly marked cars have been introduced to improve road safety and protect children and while it is disappointing that @entity5 does not share this view , we would be more than happy to meet him and explain why we believe it is important to effectively manage parking outside schools			1
' the @entity163 also attacked mr @entity5 ' pledge			2
policy adviser @entity165 said : ' parking outside schools can be a big problem			0
many drivers take risks to avoid the rush such as ignoring the hatched areas outside or speeding			0
' cllr @entity172 , transport board chairman of the @entity173 , added : ' cctv cameras cars account for just two per cent of total council parking income			2
' these figures also show that less than one per cent of motorists are appealing fines issued by @entity20 enforcement and that when they have grounds for appeal the system works			2
' the reality is that the average motorist is paying 30 times more to @entity186 in charges and taxation each year than they do to their town hall through parking			2
' among more than 60 councils which already run @entity20 cars , the biggest earner was @entity194 - which handed out 27,719 fines worth almost £ 2 million			1
@entity196 , director of the @entity198 pressure group @entity197 , said many councils ignore strict rules which say @entity20 cars must only be used where it is dangerous for a traffic warden to work			1
he added : ' the huge numbers of tickets given out in error and later dropped highlights the risk to innocent people of these spy cars			1
' when people see the multi-million pound enterprise cctv cars have become they will rightly be asking if this is less about public safety and more about revenue raising			1
a fine mess : @entity20 cars are allowed to park on double yellow lines in many areas , leading to claims of double standards			0
countless drivers have complained that using a machine does n't take circumstances into account transport secretary @entity225 , pictured , has tabled an investigation into councils ' use of @entity20 with the intention of scrapping the controversial cars			1
town halls now issue nine million parking fines a year @entity233 * @entity234 of @entity235 * @entity236 * @entity237 * @entity238 * * @entity239 * @entity240 * @entity241 of @entity243 @entity242 * areas are all overseen by the @entity245 , which plans to introduce mobile cctv in early 2014 * * introduction will be delayed depending on further statements from the government ' equally , the high revenues highlight what a lousy deterrent @entity20 is – even when it is a blindingly obvious spy car			1
' councils should be working to solve the underlying problems of congestion around schools and understand why so many children arrive by car			0
' just one council in @entity97 which could introduce @entity20 cars has publicly ruled out doing so			2
a spokesman for @entity262 said it ran ' contrary to the spirit of fair [ ness ] and common sense of on - street traffic management			2
' it emerged on december 15 that transport secretary @entity225 has tabled an investigation into @entity20 cars with a view to banning them			0
the government 's changes will also extend the grace period before motorists receive a fine from five minutes to 15			0
a @entity277 spokesman said : ' we have recently published proposals to ban @entity20 for parking			0
' subject to the consultation process , the government will then amend legislation and associated statutory guidance to deliver on this pledge			0

ministers say the 100 - plus cctv cars fleece motorists on ' industrial scale '
the cars *automatically* catch drivers breaking traffic rules as they pass
@entity5 vowed to outlaw them - but more keep hitting the streets
councils with new spy cars include @entity301 , *eighth* - biggest in @entity97
the ' cash cow ' fines were worth £ 30 million in the last year alone
