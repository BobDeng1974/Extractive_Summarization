the war veteran who successfully campaigned for a medal to honour the @entity2 has died at the age of 93			1
commander @entity4 was the leading force in the 17 - year fight to award a medal to 70,000 sailors whose service on what @entity10 called ‘ the worst journey in the world ’ to @entity14 went unrecognised when the conflict ended			1
his death comes just three months after the survivors were finally presented with their @entity19 medals by @entity20			1
honoured : commander @entity4 , who passed away just three months after his @entity21 was presented to him after a 17 - year campaign the retired naval officer passed away at his daughter @entity25 ’s home in @entity27 yesterday			1
she said : ‘ i want to pay tribute to his determination , his tenacity and strength			2
he was an unstoppable force who fought for what he believed in and what was right			2
’ @entity37 , a radar operator , was serving on @entity39 when she was torpedoed during one of the supply missions to ship arms to the @entity43 in 1942			0
he was blown more than 30ft clear of the ship in the blast , then survived more than ten minutes in the freezing seas before he was rescued			0
@entity25 , 65 , said her father had been in poor health and in and out of hospital for the past 18 months after he suffered a heart attack			2
‘ he was a wonderful , wonderful gentleman with true spirit , ’ she added			0
after the war , he was stationed at the @entity53 in @entity54 , @entity55 , and used his supreme naval knowledge to advise and rebuild the nation ’s navy along @entity60 lines			0
awarded : @entity37 was surrounded by his family when he was presented with a medal after campaigning for the last survivors of the 70,000 soldiers of the @entity65 the @entity67 - born sailor spent 35 years living in @entity55 , before returning to the @entity60 in the late 1970s			1
in the meantime , he had built up quite a following travelling @entity55 giving lectures in schools about @entity73 ’s @entity72 warship , the @entity74 , and his beloved adopted home of @entity27			0
as an early volunteer for the @entity77 , @entity37 was instrumental in driving @entity27 ’s burgeoning tourism industry and was lauded by civic leaders			0
however , efforts to get him awarded an obe never materialised			0
in the mid- 1990s , @entity37 became president of the now - defunct @entity83 and was elected by fellow veterans to start a campaign for their own @entity19 medal			1
the war heroes , who faced a gauntlet of @entity90 u-boats and warplanes during the icy supply missions to @entity93 , were aggrieved that their efforts were lumped in with the separate @entity95			0
some 3,000 sailors lost their lives in the vital missions , which were dubbed ‘ the worst journey in the world ’ by @entity10			0
following the collapse of the @entity43 , it was felt that time had come for an @entity104 medal to be struck			2
the campaign thrust @entity37 into the spotlight , and he attacked the mission with typical military vigour			0
he often spent up to 18 hours a day writing letters to politicians , and inundated @entity111 with facts , figures and arguments outlining the veterans ’ injustice			0
his quest was strongly supported by his local newspaper @entity118 in @entity27 , which obtained a 46,000 - signed petition and organised for 500 convoys survivors to march on @entity121 to call for a medal			2
hero : the chief of defence staff general sir @entity124 presents @entity37 with the first @entity19 medal at a special ceremony at one point , the octogenarian was given his own office in the paper ’s print room			1
despite numerous setbacks , the @entity134 government relented under public pressure and awarded an @entity19 emblem badge in 2006			1
however , the lapel badge was far from an official medal and @entity37 fought on			1
his campaign received renewed vigour in 2010 when the @entity142 came to power			0
previous @entity146 leaders @entity144 and @entity147 had backed the cause , and made public promises that a @entity146 government would finally strike a medal			2
however , now aged 91 years , @entity37 still had to fight for another two and a half years before the campaign was finally won			1
during that time , he clashed publicly with the armed forces minister @entity153 and accused @entity20 of betraying to @entity146 party ’s medal promise			1
it was typical of the man , whose soft @entity159 voice belied the fire which burned ferociously in his belly			0
finally , after an independent @entity121 review , mr @entity20 announced last december that a new @entity19 would be struck			1
cdr @entity4 was by this time in rude health following his heart attack and could not travel to @entity111 to be given his medal			1
civic leaders instead honoured him with a special event held at @entity168 earlier this year , which was the last time @entity37 was seen in public			0
the chief of defence staff general sir @entity124 paid tribute to @entity37 yesterday			0
the @entity60 ’s most senior military officer presented @entity37 with his @entity19 at a ceremony at @entity168 in march this year			1
general sir @entity124 said : ‘ i was delighted and truly humbled to be able to present commander @entity4 with his @entity104 medal in @entity27 in march			1
‘ @entity4 was a young sailor when he endured the hardships of the @entity104 convoys which @entity10 called the worst journey in the world			2
‘ it is in great part through his tireless efforts that the achievements and endurance of those involved in the convoys have been recognised			0
’ the second sea lord vice-admiral @entity185 said : ‘ i was greatly saddened to hear cdr @entity4 has passed away			2
‘ he fought bravely for our country in the @entity189 , especially on the @entity65 , and he fought just as valiantly to gain the recognition for his comrades , who endured the terrible hardships of those convoys , that they so richly deserved			1
‘ i am thankful that he was able to receive his @entity19 from the chief of defence staff back in march before his passing			2
‘ on behalf of the @entity195 , i would wish to pass my sincere condolences to his family			0
