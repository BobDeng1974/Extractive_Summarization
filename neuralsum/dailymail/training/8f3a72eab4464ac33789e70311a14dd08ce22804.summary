by @entity0 a former @entity3 fighter serving four life sentences for trying to recruit home - grown terrorists to kill @entity7 soldiers can keep his family home , a court has ruled			1
in a legal first , police tried to confiscate @entity13 's four - bedroom home after he turned the property in @entity15 into a ' production centre ' for extremist propaganda			1
but in a landmark @entity20 ruling , senior law lord sir @entity18 refused to make the order because of the effect it would have on @entity13 's ' wholly innocent ' family			1
a judge has ruled @entity13 ( left ) can keep the @entity15 home he used to recruit terrorists ( right ) the judge found that the family home , which once contained a collection of 50,000 extremist books , dvds and cds , can not be forfeited to pay @entity13 's £ 400,000 in legal aid costs and £ 100,000 in prosecution costs			1
the case is believed to be the first ever bid to seize the home of a convicted terrorist using new laws under @entity42 of the @entity43			2
@entity13 had argued that the family home and the two rented properties were not owned by him and were in the names of other family members including his wife @entity48 and daughter @entity48			1
his family said it would be unfair to confiscate the their home , which houses three generations			2
they also said the two other properties are the main source of income and the livelihood for the families and confiscation of those would be a ' gross injustice '			0
father - of - three @entity13 was at the centre of a plot to radicalise and persuade vulnerable young men to ' fight , kill and die ' in a jihad in @entity68 , his trial in 2011 heard			1
the judge ruled @entity13 's family were ' wholly innocent ' and should not have to move out @entity13 was inspired to head to @entity68 by the allied invasion which followed the 9/11 terror attacks			1
he joined the @entity3 as an ' active terrorist ' but was captured and jailed in november 2001			0
but by may 2002 he was released by the authorities in @entity76 and headed back to @entity15			0
the father - of - three ran a @entity78 , @entity80 book stall , on @entity82 market in @entity15 to spread the word of @entity80			2
@entity13 's operation was ' sophisticated , ruthless and well honed ' , the judge said , with him dedicating his life to the recruitment of men willing to fight abroad in the name of extremist @entity80			1
his son , @entity90 , was cleared by the jury in the same trial as his father of a single count of engaging in conduct in preparation for terrorism			0
but after @entity13 's conviction , his son and other family living at the property fought the authorities ' attempts to get a forfeiture order for the house			1
@entity13 's family say they can not live in one of his two other properties , which have been divided into flats and provide them with income @entity13 owns two other houses in @entity15 , which are rented out , with those assets worth £ 510,000 in all			1
but , in his ruling today , judge sir @entity0 said that the two other houses were ' unsuitable ' to rehouse the family if the main home was forfeited as they are divided into flats			1
however , the judge did order that @entity13 should be liable for the legal costs of bringing the trial			1
@entity76 - born @entity7 citizen @entity13 , was captured in a police sting when two undercover anti-terrorism police officers infiltrated his group wearing secret bugging devices			1
he had bragged to the officers how he had fought with the @entity3 and told them they could become ' martyrs ' for the cause			0
under @entity129 of the @entity43 a convicted terrorist can have their assets seized by the state under a forfeiture order			0
the @entity13 family were informed of the @entity135 's @entity137 's intention to seize the house at the end of @entity13 's trial			1
the courts found @entity13 attempted to radicalise men and recruit them for jihad at the house			2
but the judge ordered the seizure proceedings to take place after the outcome of @entity13 's appeal			1
his outraged family say they are entitled to a private and family life and will use the @entity153 to fight the move			0
their solicitor @entity155 said the act had been misinterpreted and would be in breach of the @entity159 if it created case law			0
the @entity135 has said the power to forfeit residential premises in these circumstances is a new power under the @entity165 2008			0
he also found ' amusement ' in the sight of the flag - draped coffins of fallen allied troops returning from @entity68			0
@entity13 was given four life sentences and told he must serve a minimum of nine years before he can be considered for parole after being convicted of preparing for acts of terrorism , three counts of soliciting to murder and one count of dissemination of terrorist publications , following a four month trial at @entity183 in 2011			2
the forfeiture proceedings had been brought by the @entity185 ( @entity186 ) and the @entity135			0
outside court today , detective superintendent @entity187 said : ' @entity13 was convicted and sentenced in 2011 of preparation for terrorist acts overseas , three counts of soliciting to murder and dissemination of terrorist publications and given four life sentences			0
' all of the offences took place at @entity196 , @entity82 , @entity15 , which is the @entity197 home			2
' the ruling by sir @entity18 demonstrates a proportionate response to the evidence placed before the court			0
' @entity202 agreed that the ruling give due consideration to those ' interested parties ' so that no innocent party was unduly punished or made homeless as a result of this hearing			0
' the £ 500k costs order should draw to a conclusion this protracted and complex investigation into the most serious offences that threatened the lives of coalition forces overseas			0
' @entity13 threatened to kill 40 - 50 military personnel when planning his attacks			2
the ruling provides some redress to the state for the significant cost to the public purse and hopefully acts as a deterrent to those considering terrorist acts			0

@entity13 turned home in @entity15 into a *factory* of extremist *material*
he tried to recruit home - grown jihadists to attack @entity7 soldiers
police *wanted* to seize the property to pay off £ *500,000* cost of his trial
but senior judge has ruled the former @entity3 fighter can keep property
he *feared* the order would make @entity13 's ' wholly innocent ' family homeless
@entity13 owns three properties in @entity15 , two of which are rented out
judge ruled it was unfair to force family to live in the other flats he owns
