by @entity0 @entity2 's silver medal was a rare highlight for @entity4 at @entity5			1
at the @entity6 he will go for gold for @entity8 on the opening evening , and might need to break the world record to get it			1
despite receiving £ 25m in funding during the four - year build up to the @entity6 , @entity10 returned a paltry three medals			1
focused : @entity8 swimmer @entity2 is determined to win gold after grabbing silver at @entity5 decent bet : @entity6 and @entity17 medalist @entity16 has backed @entity2 , pictured , to shine the other two were bronze , both won by @entity19			1
they fell two medals short of their pre-games target and had their funding slashed by 15 % ahead of the 2016 @entity25			2
but @entity16 , who won one @entity17 and three @entity6 medals during his career , claims @entity29 swimmers are about to bounce back in @entity30			1
‘ at the @entity17 we were always there or thereabouts , but we did n’t get medals and obviously that looked like the @entity29 swimmers had underperformed , ’ said @entity16 , ‘ but there are over 200 countries that compete at the @entity17 — it is incredibly competitive and @entity29 have never managed to get more than three medals since the mid- 80s			1
so it was n’t a disastrous games for us			0
‘ but @entity30 is a massive opportunity to put that right			0
it ’s still on home soil and that will be a benefit			0
there will be a great deal of energy in there and it ’s up to the athletes to feed off that and fulfil their potential			0
’ @entity2 will lead the charge in the 200m breaststroke			1
his @entity17 final , where he came second behind @entity55 ’s @entity54 , was screened live at @entity56 before his beloved @entity59 ’s @entity58 clash with @entity60 that same night			2
he will take centre stage on thursday evening when the action gets underway			0
form : @entity2 , right , poses with @entity63 and @entity64 after the @entity29 championships formidable : @entity2 competes at @entity66 for @entity67 in december last year swimming legend @entity68 says @entity2 will be aiming for a world record			2
‘ he ’s got the body to do it , he ’s got the ability to do it , he ’s got the mind to do it , ’ @entity68 said , with @entity2 ’s @entity70 standing at 2:07.43mins — just 0.42seconds outside the world record			2
‘ there ’s no reason why he ca n’t do it			0
@entity2 might have to break the world record to win gold , such is the quality of the field			1
@entity84 @entity83 , the @entity17 silver medallist in the 100m , will be a threat as will the @entity89 ’s training partner , @entity91 @entity90			1
if @entity2 can win gold , it could the pave the way for further glory in the years to come , with the @entity25 just two years down the line			1
given that @entity19 , now retired , won over half of @entity10 ’s swimming medals at the last two @entity17 , @entity4 could struggle in @entity99			1
but @entity19 thinks it ’s back on the right track			2
faith in @entity29 swimming : @entity16 and @entity19 think performances will improve in @entity30 ‘ i do n’t see the amount of medals in @entity109 being hugely different because we have never won more than three , it ’s predicting the colour that ’s hard , ’ said @entity19 , who was speaking at an @entity105 , @entity106			1
‘ @entity2 is likely to still be up there and there are good youngsters coming through			2
to have something like the @entity6 is such an amazing stepping stone so hopefully there ’ll be a roll - on effect			0
we ’re definitely in a better place than we have been in a long time			0
‘ my old coach @entity120 is now @entity121 and @entity122 is performance director			0
we should have had them for the last ten years			0
we ’ve been attempting to replicate @entity124 and @entity84 , now we ’ve got our own plan			0
‘ let ’s not follow , let ’s lead			0

@entity2 finished second in the 200m breaststroke at @entity5
@entity89 wants gold at @entity131 in front of a home crowd
@entity4 has spent £ 25m on funding in last four years but @entity10 only won three medals at @entity5
despite that , @entity17 and @entity6 medalist @entity16 thinks @entity4 will bounce back at the @entity6
