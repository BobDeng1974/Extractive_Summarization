the doctor doing the scan was dr @entity65 , consultant in foetal medicine at @entity67 , @entity68			1
‘ he looked at my medical history and said he would personally ensure this time we ’d go home with a baby , ’ recalls @entity30			0
‘ there was something about the way he talked , the way he took control and spoke in such a positive way that made me feel for the first time there was a chance things would be all right			0

he even did my scans himself			0

‘ how many patients can text their busy consultant day or night and know they will always get a text back ? ’ asks @entity30			0

the pregnancy was ectopic — where the foetus develops in the fallopian tube instead of the uterus			0
the embryo and both @entity30 ’s fallopian tubes had to be removed			0
after eight heartbreaking miscarriages , having spent close to £ 80,000 on @entity46 cycles , the couple decided to have one last attempt			1

with dr @entity65 ’s help , @entity40 was born naturally at 37 weeks in december 2010			1

‘ @entity65 was on holiday when i sent him a text at 6am , ’ @entity133 says			1
‘ despite being hundreds of miles away , he rang the hospital to make sure two intensive - care cots were available and that they knew it had to be an emergency caesarean			0
’ @entity133 is now expecting a third baby			0
