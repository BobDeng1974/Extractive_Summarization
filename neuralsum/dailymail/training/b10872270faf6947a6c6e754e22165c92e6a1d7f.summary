ms @entity51 said @entity14 needs to be able to work through problems with @entity10 in order to maintain that trade serves both nations but @entity10 sees the purchase as an affront to its claims and its past calls for negotiations and , despite @entity14 ’s attempts to calm the dispute , responded with fury			1

‘ we are closely monitoring the development of the situation and reserve the right to take necessary measures			0
’ @entity88 , an expert on regional security at the @entity90 in @entity91 , said the sending of the @entity3 patrol boats ‘ ups the stakes ’ although it is unlikely that the @entity3 boats would go within the 12 nautical miles around the islands that are considered @entity4 territorial waters			1
‘ it 's a tit - for - tat response because @entity3 is extremely sensitive about sovereignty matters , ’ he said			0
@entity4 's coast guard said it has not taken any special measures in response to the @entity3 patrol boats although it continues to monitor the situation			2
' @entity4 has a pretty robust navy , a very strong and active professional coast guard			2
it 's a game of who blinks first , ’ @entity88 said			0
@entity10 's anger has been accompanied by heated reporting in @entity3 's state media with a commentator in the @entity114 called @entity4 's move ‘ the most blatant challenge to @entity3 's sovereignty since the end of @entity119 ’ @entity3 on tuesday also started broadcasting a daily marine weather report for the islands			1
about a dozen protesters gathered outside the @entity4 @entity123 in @entity10 chanting , ’ @entity4 , get out of @entity3			1
’ the protests have spread , with a number of people waving placards and the @entity3 flag and shouted ‘ defend the @entity8 ’ outside the @entity4 consulate general in southern @entity131 and about 200 people marched in @entity133 in @entity135 province , singing the national anthem , local media reported			0
rising tensions : protesters in @entity139 , @entity3 , hold placards and banners at a demonstration against @entity4 's claim of the disputed islands last month top @entity4 government officials maintain that the flare - up has n't affected official ties with @entity3 , although deputy prime minister @entity148 acknowledged that emotions on both sides were being fanned by activists			1
@entity3 also has announced coordinates marking out the waters off the @entity8 that it considers its territory			0
the coordinates are another step , along with recent announcements of @entity3 's intention to use law enforcement vessels , to defend its sovereignty claim , said @entity162 , northeast @entity163 project director for the @entity164			0
‘ it 's primarily about being seen as taking action to pave the way for further actions to assert @entity3 's sovereignty , ’ she said			0
in @entity14 , gov. @entity50 renewed his calls for the islands to be developed for future use by fishermen			1
‘ it appears that the matter is decided , ‘ he told reporters			0

" @entity50 said he was freezing the 1.4 billion yen ( £ 11.2 million ) donated toward his purchase plan for the islands and would only release the funds to the government once it was clear whether a port or other facilities would be built			2
he also suggested that @entity4 cooperate with the @entity188 and @entity189 , which also have disputes with @entity3 in the @entity191			0
‘ we should n't see this as an issue that only concerns @entity4 , ’ he said			0
