by @entity0 with his handsome chestnut plumage and rapacious sexual appetite , the ruddy duck has long been designated a ruddy pest			0
every year , the promiscuous male of the @entity7 species flies south to @entity8 where he ravishes females of the rare white - headed duck			1
such is the ruddy duck ’s success with the ladies in @entity8 – to the humiliating detriment of the cuckolded male white - heads there – that @entity17 complained of the threat to its native bird ’s survival			1
the @entity8 government fears the @entity7 - bred ruddy duck is putting their country 's species at risk not satisfied with one partner , the blue - billed @entity7 birds with snow - white cheeks have let their fancies take flight			1
they fathered so many cross-breed ‘ @entity34 ducklings ’ that the precious line of white - heads was in danger of being bred out of existence , causing all manner of a flutter in diplomatic corridors			0
and so , to appease the @entity8 , @entity7 ministers have spent ten years and £ 4million trying to slaughter the ruddy duck			1
yesterday it emerged they have found a further £ 120,000 of taxpayers ’ money to fully exterminate the @entity7 species , even though it causes no harm in the @entity48			1
an estimated 100 – or even as few as 20 – remain , hiding among the reeds in remote watery corners of @entity51 , @entity52 and @entity53			2
now there is a £ 2,500 bounty on each coppery head , and one day the final ruddy duck will peer above the rushes and stare down the barrel of a hunting rifle			2
the massacre of the ruddy duck was ordered in 2003 by the @entity62 following a series of protests from @entity17			1
the massacre of the ruddy duck was ordered in 2003 by @entity62 ( the @entity62 ) , following a series of government - level protests from @entity17 so far the cull has claimed some 5,500 ruddy ducks , causing anger among @entity7 conservationists , bird lovers and landowners			1
the @entity73 has taken the government ’s side , leaving some of its members incensed			0
one , @entity77 , 69 , of @entity78 , @entity79 , told the @entity80 : ‘ if the @entity8 government or environmentalists do not like the idea of the ruddy duck mating with their white - head ducks , then they should cull them when they arrive in @entity8			2
' it ’s what ducks do , and why should we foot the bill ? the @entity94 goose is becoming a problem in @entity48 , but any culling will quite rightly be paid for by the @entity7 taxpayer			1
‘ tell @entity8 to leave well alone or do its own dirty business , and send them a bill for costs incurred to date			0
’ the ruddy duck is native to @entity102 , where its population is around 700,000			0
it was introduced to @entity48 from the @entity105 more than 50 years ago by sir @entity106 , and since then has slowly established itself across @entity108			1
@entity109 , chairman of @entity110 in @entity111 , told the @entity112 : ‘ they are beautiful things			0
it ’s very sad and i ca n’t make sense of it			0
‘ they ’ve never been a nuisance here and it seems a ridiculous amount of @entity75 money to spend on getting rid of them			0
’ @entity124 , of the @entity125 , said : ‘ the whole thing is a fiasco			0
‘ it ’s a total waste of public money , and all that will happen when the cull stops is that new ducks will fly over from the @entity133 , and we ’ll be back to square one			2
’ there are still relatively large populations of ruddy duck in @entity139 and @entity140 , meaning that even if the @entity7 effort is successful , the tragic loneliness of male white - head ducks in @entity8 may continue			0
@entity62 said the government ’s action was ‘ in line with the commitment of other @entity108 countries to eradicate ruddy ducks elsewhere by 2015 ’ .			2

promiscuous males fly to *mainland* @entity108 where it ravishes females
*officials* in @entity17 feared their native species was at risk as a result
ministers have found a further £ 120,000 to fully cull the birds
more than 5,500 killed so far , and only around 20 are left in the @entity48
