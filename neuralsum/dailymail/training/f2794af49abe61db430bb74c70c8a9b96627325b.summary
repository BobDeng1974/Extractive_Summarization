cockroaches are known to be able to survive a nuclear explosion – and once day they could be saving trapped victims in a variety of disasters			1
researchers have fitted the hardy creatures with electrical backpacks complete with tiny microphones to detect the faintest of sounds			1
the idea is that cyborg cockroaches , or ‘ biobots ’ , could enter crumpled buildings hit by earthquakes , for example , and help emergency workers find survivors			1
they could one day be used in emergency situations to detect survivors ‘ in a collapsed building , sound is the best way to find survivors , ’ said @entity30 , an assistant professor of electrical and computer engineering at @entity31			1
‘ the goal is to use the biobots with high - resolution microphones to differentiate between sounds that matter - like people calling for help - from sounds that do n't matter - like a leaking pipe			2
‘ once we 've identified sounds that matter , we can use the biobots equipped with microphone arrays to zero - in on where those sounds are coming from			0
’ cockroaches to the rescue ? cyborg cockroaches , or ‘ biobots ’ could one day enter crumpled buildings hit by earthquakes and help emergency works find survivors			1
a rescue worker searching for victims is pictured professor @entity30 's team has recently demonstrated technology that creates an invisible fence for keeping biobots in a defined area			0
this is significant because it could be used to keep them at a disaster site and to keep the biobots within range of each other so that they can be used as a reliable mobile wireless network			0
the technology could also be used to steer biobots to light sources , so that tiny solar panels on biobot backpacks can be recharged			2
the ‘ backpacks ’ control the robo - roach 's movements because they are wired to the insect ’s cerci - sensory organs that cockroaches usually use to feel if their abdomens brush against something			1
by electrically stimulating the cerci , cockroaches can be prompted to move in a certain direction			2
in fact , they have been programmed to seek out sound			1
one type of ' backpack ' is equipped with an array of three directional microphones to detect the direction of the sound and steer the biobot in the right direction towards it			0
another type is fitted with a single microphone to capture sound from any direction , which can be wirelessly transmitted - perhaps in the future to emergency workers			1
they ‘ worked well ’ in lab tests and the experts have developed technology that can be used as an ‘ invisible fence ’ to keep the biobots in a certain area such as a disaster area , the researchers announced at the @entity105 2014 conference in @entity106 , @entity107			0
a previous study led by dr @entity116 , who is also at the university , showed that biobots can be used to map a disaster area			0
dr @entity116 and professor @entity30 plan on merging their research to both map disaster areas and pinpoint survivors			0
the idea of turning cockroaches into cyborg slaves is not new , @entity126 reported			2
kits are available for under $ 100 ( £ 63 ) that enable people to control their own insect by stimulating its antennae with electrical signals			2
this lets people ' drive ' an insect for a few minutes			0
while the creators of the ' @entity142 ' claim the cockroach forgets the experience after 20 minutes , some people think it is cruel .			0

researchers at @entity31 have fitted cockroaches with electrical ' backpacks ' to control their movement
device is wired to their sensory organs and contains microphones
cyborg roaches are programmed to seek out the faintest of *noises*
they could one day be sent into crumpled buildings to seek out trapped survivors of earthquakes and send data to emergency workers , for example
