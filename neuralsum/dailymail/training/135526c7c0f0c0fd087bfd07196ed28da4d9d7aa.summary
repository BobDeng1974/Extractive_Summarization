by @entity0 published : 03:14 est , 8 april 2013 updated : 06:01 est , 8 april 2013 finally off the dole : @entity2 will be made to work as a cleaner at @entity4 once he comes off suicide watch after being jailed for life for killing six of his children in a house fire child - killing benefits scrounger @entity2 is finally being forced to get a job - as a prison cleaner			1
the father - of - 17 , who has n't worked for ten years , claimed tens of thousands in state hand - outs before being jailed last week for burning six of his children to death			1
now he faces having to mop floors at notorious high - security @entity4 for just £ 14 a week , it was reported by the @entity21 he will be punished if he refuses			1
a source told the paper : ' he is used to getting his women and kids to do all the work for him — but he wo n’t just be able to lean on the mop for half an hour and say he ’s done			1
' officers will inspect his handiwork and report to the governor			2
the same goes for the cleanliness of his cell			2
' his £ 14 wage can be spent on cigarettes and sweets , but this will be axed if he does n't pull his weight			1
@entity2 , 56 , has not done a proper day 's work since 2003 and has not held a full - time job since 1991			1
instead , he claimed the equivalent of a £ 100,000 salary in benefits for the 11 children in his custody and the wages from wife , @entity48 , and live - in lover , @entity50 , which he forced them to pay into his bank account			1
he was jailed for life with a minimum term of 15 years for killing children @entity56 , 13 , @entity58 , ten , @entity59 , nine , @entity60 , eight , @entity61 , six , and @entity62 , five			1
@entity48 , and best friend @entity2 were also jailed for 17 years for manslaughter			0
@entity2 will be put to work once he is off suicide watch at @entity4 - also known as @entity66 - where some of @entity68 's most dangerous criminals are held			1
but it is possible he will never have to take up the cleaning job as he may need to be locked up in solitary confinement for his entire life sentence to protect him from attacks , it was reported in @entity75			1
prison bosses fear it will never be safe for him to mingle with other inmates after reportedly learning of two separate plots to target him just days into his term			1
not for the faint - hearted : @entity2 will be made to scrub his wing at notorious @entity4 ( pictured ) where some of @entity68 's most dangerous criminals are held hate figure : @entity2 may have to locked up in solitary confinement at @entity4 for his entire life sentence over fears he will forever be the target of attacks by other inmates neighbours from hell : other inmates being held at @entity4 include ' @entity68 's most - violent prisoner ' @entity94 ( left ) and child killer @entity95 ( right ) one of those has apparently come from a group of gypsies who gave him £ 3,000 thinking his children were victims of a mystery arsonist			1
he is currently being housed in a @entity105 - fronted cell and prison bosses do not see ' any immediate prospect ' of him being transferred to a normal wing			2
guards can monitor him 24 hours a day and he will wear special clothes that can not be torn into strips to make a noose			2
keeping him in isolation would double the cost of housing a prisoner on an ordinary unit from £ 600,000 to £ 1.2million			2
a source told the @entity75 : ' while he is in the plastic - fronted cell , he is as safe as any prisoner in the country			2
but threats are already coming in			0
' victims and killer : @entity2 was jailed for killing children @entity56 , 13 , @entity58 , ten , @entity59 , nine , @entity60 , eight , @entity61 , six , and @entity62 , five			0
his wife , @entity48 , and friend @entity2 were also jailed for 17 years for manslaughter horrific reminder : the scorched home where the @entity2 children died will now be bulldozed in an attempt to help the community move on from the tragedy child benefit @entity2 : £ 20.30 a week for eldest son , £ 13.40 for the other ten			0
yearly total : £ 8,023.60p working tax credits @entity48 : up to £ 20,560 a year for her six children @entity50 : up to £ 17,870 for her five children estimated earnings from their cleaning jobs : £ 14,000 yearly total : £ 38,430 housing benefit @entity2 : £ 150 a week yearly total : £ 7,800 @entity146 : £ 68,000 this is the approximate take - home pay of someone earning £ 100,000 it is thought @entity2 will eventually be placed in the segregation area away from the main prison population			2
but the unit is still home to @entity68 ’s most violent inmate , 60 - year - old @entity94 , who has moved prisons 120 times due to his long record of attacks on staff and other prisoners			1
the @entity162 jail is also home to child murderers @entity95 , 44 , and @entity165 , 65			1
it is where @entity168 murderer @entity167 , 39 , was attacked and where serial killer dr @entity170 , 57 , hanged himself			2
@entity2 will exercise alone , supervised by three guards so he can not be attacked en route to the yard or gym			0
he will eat all his meals in his cell , and everything he does will be recorded in a log			0
a source said : ' @entity2 is going to be looking over his shoulder for the next 15 years			0
' @entity2 masterminded the botched attempt to frame @entity183 , who had moved out of their family home in @entity186 , @entity187 , earlier in the year with her five children , taking with her the £ 1,000 a month they were worth in benefit payments			0
the scorched home where the @entity2 children died will now be bulldozed in an attempt to help the community move on from the tragedy			0
sickening behaviour : @entity197 captures trilby - wearing @entity2 taking the microphone to perform karaoke just days after killing six of his children in the blaze despicable betrayal : @entity2 and his wife @entity48 put on a tearful performance at a press conference appealing for information about the fire knowing full well it was them who killed the children yesterday , @entity197 footage emerged of the moment @entity2 was seen drunk and swaying in a t - shirt and trilby , while performing karaoke at a pub party just days after the blaze			1
locals watched in disgust as he downed shots , embraced his wife @entity48 and took centre stage to sing @entity225 ’s hit @entity224			0
the bizarre behaviour in the wake of the deaths prompted witnesses to call the police , who arrested the couple just nine hours later			0
on may 26 last year , just 15 days after the fatal fire , @entity2 and his wife went to the @entity234 in @entity187 , located across the road from the conference centre where they sobbed for the cameras days earlier at a now infamous press conference			0
they arrived at about 4.30pm and were seen drinking vodka , gin , rum and @entity244 ’s before @entity2 , clearly revelling in the attention , got up to the microphone			0
he sang the 1975 @entity225 classic @entity224 , with the line : ‘ we ’re caught in a trap , i ca n’t walk out , because i love you too much baby			0
’ a number of people who had seen the performance were so stunned they called the police to report them acting suspiciously			0
