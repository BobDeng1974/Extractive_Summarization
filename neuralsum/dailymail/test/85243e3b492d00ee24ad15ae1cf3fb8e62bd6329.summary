a @entity1 goal was enough to put @entity3 top of the @entity4 with just two games of the season remaining following a 1 - 0 win over @entity8			1
the @entity9 went into the game knowing a win would take them back into the automatic promotion places following @entity15 's victory at @entity16 on friday			1
they looked as though they would have to settle for second after @entity20 put @entity21 ahead against @entity22 and on course for top spot , but @entity26 's stoppage - time penalty at the @entity27 denied the @entity28 and left @entity3 on top of the pile			1
@entity1 fired @entity3 into the lead with a stunning strike in the 56th minute @entity8 goalkeeper @entity33			1
is powerless to stop @entity1 's sublime effort the decisive goal at @entity36 came in the 56th minute when substitute @entity37 crossed from the left and @entity1 sent a fine volleyed finish into the top corner past goalkeeper @entity33			1
despite looking good in possession going forward , it took the @entity9 almost 20 minutes to begin to open up the @entity8 defence			2
they were unfortunate not to take the lead , though , when a fine pass from @entity48 created the opportunity for @entity50 who was denied by a good save with his legs by @entity33			0
the ball then broke for @entity54 , whose follow - up was deflected up and onto the crossbar			0
@entity54 and @entity48 threatened before the home side went close again when the ball was played into @entity59 and he spun superbly away from his man to shift the ball onto his left foot before curling a shot narrowly wide of the far post			0
@entity1 races away to celebrate his decisive goal for the @entity9 @entity3 continued to press for the breakthrough in the remainder of the first half but they were unable to seriously threaten again before the interval			1
but it was a double change from manager @entity72 in the 54th minute that was to prove the catalyst for his side taking the lead as he brought on @entity78 and @entity79 for @entity80 and @entity54			0
within two minutes , @entity78 had been released down the left by @entity50 and the @entity83 international 's first - time cross into the near post was met by a superb effort over his right shoulder by @entity1			2
@entity83 forward @entity37 made a huge contribution when he was introduced in the 54th minute having gone in front , @entity3 missed a great chance to double their lead a couple of minutes later when @entity59 's floated free - kick picked out the unmarked @entity92 , but he headed over the top			2
@entity92 had another chance and on this occasion he did nothing wrong , meeting an @entity59 corner with a downward header only to see it cleared off the goal - line			0
there was little else in the way of goalmouth action , with the drama instead coming on the south coast as @entity72 's men were left with their destiny in their own hands .			0

@entity1 stuck the only goal of the game in the 56th minute
if the @entity9 win their final two games , they will be promoted
@entity21 were held 2 - 2 at home to @entity22
