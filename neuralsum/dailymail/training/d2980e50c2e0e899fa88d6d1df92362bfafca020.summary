’ ex-treasury minister @entity9 attacked the ' action plan ' issued by the @entity11 which says public sector bodies should be ' simplifying adverts and using language which will encourage candidates ' mrs @entity9 , who has positions in both public and private sector boardrooms , said : ‘ i am all in favour of equal opportunities and there is certainly some evidence from the @entity30 that women on boards improve company performance			1
‘ but i do n’t think things need to be made simple just so women can get their heads around things			2
i think organisations should use plain @entity18 to attract the right candidates regardless of gender			1
’ mrs @entity9 , 63 , sits on the board of @entity42 , a public body which mr @entity4 chairs			1
she is also chief executive of @entity44 , the industry body for @entity46 ’s biggest power firms			0
mrs @entity9 added : ‘ none of my jobs have been traditionally “ female ” , so i can honestly say it makes no difference to me if my colleagues are male or female			1
in the end , it ’s ability that counts			0
’ @entity56 , @entity3 mp for @entity57 , also criticised the plan and asked for the document to be reworded			2
the guidelines have been published by the @entity61 ( @entity61 )			0
its job is to meet the government ’s target of ensuring that half of all senior posts within government and public sector organisations are filled by women by 2015			0
but despite the criticism from mrs @entity9 and ms @entity56 , some female business leaders support the action plan			1
the document adds : ' job adverts and specifications [ should ] use plain @entity18 and avoid jargon to appeal to the widest field of applicants ' @entity81 , of independent pressure group @entity82 , said : ‘ top women are being put off when it comes to applying for roles by job advertisements laden with historic public sector jargon			1

commissioner sir @entity92 ’s report for 2012 - 13 paints a rather bleak picture of public sector appointments for women			0

but in 2012 - 13 , that figure had dropped to 35.6 per cent			0
the @entity11 ’s own figures for 2012 - 13 , show that most government departments have failed to reach the equality target			2
departments such as the @entity104 had women filling only 17 per cent of vacancies , while the @entity106 fared even worse at 16 per cent			0
the @entity11 last night denied its action plan was patronising towards women			1
it said : ‘ as part of our wider work to reform @entity112 , we want job advertisements to be clear and free of jargon			2
