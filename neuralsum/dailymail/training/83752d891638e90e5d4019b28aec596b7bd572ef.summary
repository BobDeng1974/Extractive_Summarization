@entity0 was unable to extend his winning run at the @entity2 despite a hugely creditable performance against 17th seed @entity4			1
the @entity5 took the first set in pouring rain on @entity8 but @entity4 hit back to win 4 - 6 6 - 4 6 - 2 6 - 4			1
@entity0 became the first @entity10 man to qualify at @entity2 for 41 years when he beat @entity11 in the final qualifying round on friday but the draw was not kind			1
@entity14 , a former top - 10 player , is a man of significant clay - court pedigree and a quarter - finalist here last year , when he came back from two sets down to win three successive matches			2
going home : @entity0 took the first set but was eventually undone by @entity4 although he has not been in great form this season , his movement and remarkable defensive skills are tailor - made for clay			2
@entity0 , who spent part of his junior days training in @entity29 , is also happy on the dirt and has pulled off some impressive wins , not least beating @entity33 @entity32 in @entity34 in february			0
it was @entity4 who made the better start in steady drizzle , breaking the @entity0 serve in the third game , but back came the @entity10 number three to level at 3 - 3			1
he then saved a break point to hold for 5 - 4 , his serve getting him out of trouble , and piled the pressure on @entity4 as the rain became ever heavier			2
brave : @entity0 took the first set before being beaten by no 17 seed @entity4 steady : the @entity14 showed his class to pull away from @entity0 and claim his place in the second round soon it was teeming down but on they went			1
@entity4 saved three set points but not a fourth , @entity0 taking it with a forehand winner and a pump of the fist			0
on friday , his good friend @entity57 touted @entity0 as a potential top - 50 player , describing his cross-court backhand , which was much in evidence against @entity4 , as ' maybe world class '			0
the quality and conviction of his play was hugely impressive but a break for rain did not seem to help him as on the resumption a series of loose points saw him drop his serve to start the second set			0
he continued to put pressure on @entity4 and took his chance in the eighth game to level at 4 - 4 when the @entity14 missed a backhand only to drop his serve again straight away			1
achievement : @entity0 was the first @entity10 man in 41 years to come through the qualifying rounds in rain reminiscent of the end of the opener , @entity4 served out the set , and the pair stayed in their chairs while the worst of the weather passed			1
@entity0 did not seem happy about starting again and , like in the second set , he dropped his serve straight away			0
when @entity4 held from 0 - 40 in the next game , @entity0 began to look a little weary , and the third set quickly slipped away			2
he renewed his efforts at the start of the fourth but must have felt like he was playing a wall as @entity4 retrieved everything			0
the @entity14 broke @entity0 's serve for the sixth time in the match to move 3 - 2 ahead and clinched victory after two hours and 53 minutes			1
it was not without some final heroics from @entity0 , though , who saved two match points in fine style on his own serve			0
the 27 - year - old demonstrated once again that he performs at his best on the big stage and he will have high hopes for the grass - court season .			0

@entity0 beaten 4 - 6 , 6 - 4 , 6 - 2 , 6 - 4 by no 17 seed @entity4
@entity107 took first set before rain delay and then @entity14 hit back
@entity0 was first @entity10 man to qualify for @entity2 in 41 years
