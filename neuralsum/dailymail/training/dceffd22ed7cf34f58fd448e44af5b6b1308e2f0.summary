by @entity0 0 if @entity2 could transform an abandoned railway into a beloved park , why ca n't @entity1 ? that is what landscaper and @entity1 history buff @entity6 asked himself in 2010 when he founded @entity8 , an organization dedicated to raising awareness of a blighted three - mile stretch of train tracks slicing through the heart of the @entity13			1
the idea was to transform the vast , long - defunct @entity15 covering 55 city blocks , encompassing both elevated and submerged portions , into a lush green space on the model of @entity2 's famed @entity20 - a one - mile elevated track on the lower west side			1
for nearly a century beginning in 1890 , the @entity15 carried trains laden with goods into @entity1			0
at the height of the @entity56 , the @entity1 and @entity38 , which owned the tracks , was considered the largest company in the world			2
but in early 1980s , the railroad folded following a bankruptcy			0
@entity1 ’s once - celebrated railway made up of two parts - the @entity65 tunnel and the @entity15 – has stood abandoned for the past two decades			1
in 2003 , a study commissioned by the @entity67 of @entity1 found that demolishing the viaduct would cost 10 times more than turning the space into a park			1
developing the derelict railway into a green space with bike paths , landscaping , benches and staircases for public access would set the city back $ 5.1million , while razing the tracks and the surrounding structures will cost anywhere between $ 35million and $ 51mllion			2
advocate : landscaper @entity6 had lead regular tours to the @entity15 until his death earlier this year secret space : a portion of the railway is submerged under @entity1 storied past : the train tracks had been owned by the now - defunct @entity38 , which in a video about the project produced for @entity91 just months before his passing , @entity6 described the railway as the very embodiment of @entity1 ’s spirit and its illustrious industrial past			1
‘ every city , every place has these post-industrial spaces , and they 're becoming great gardens , ’ @entity6 says in the video while making his way through one of @entity15 ’s gloomy tunnels			0
‘ @entity1 does n't have one yet - we think this is it			0
’ @entity6 was not the only one working behind the scenes to make the park plan a reality			0
a group called @entity110 have been around for more than a decade advocating for the redevelopment of the three - mile stretch of train tracks			0
money talks : a study showed that razing the rusted train tracks will cost 10 times more than redeveloping them inspiration : @entity1 activists want to model their elevated and submerged railway park on @entity2 's celebrated @entity20 members of the organization , which has come to spearhead the @entity15 project , are convinced that turning the dilapidated , rusting railway into a landscaped promenade will help revitalize the surrounding neighborhoods , which is what the @entity20 did for @entity2 's once - gritty @entity128			1
in april of this year , the advocates ' efforts finally began to bear fruits when city and state officials quietly earmarked millions of dollars toward the first phase of the @entity15 's makeover : turning a quarter - mile of the tracks into a park			2
the @entity138 below @entity1 - unusual spaces no. 2 from @entity140 on @entity141 .			0

activists in @entity1 have been working since 2003 to turn 3 miles of train tracks into a park
@entity146 and @entity15 once belonged to @entity1 and @entity38
@entity148 *declared* bankruptcy in the 1970s and train tracks have stood abandoned since 1990s
study found that demolishing the tracks will cost 10 times more than turning them into green space
