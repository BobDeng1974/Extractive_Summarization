the analysis says the statistical analysis behind that conclusion is flawed			0
the original study , reported last august , included more than 1,000 people who 'd been born in the town of @entity23 , @entity24			2
their iq was tested at ages 13 and 38 , and they were asked about marijuana use periodically between those ages			0
researchers at @entity29 and elsewhere found that participants who 'd reported becoming dependent on pot by age 18 showed a drop in iq score between ages 13 and 38			1
the findings suggest pot is harmful to the adolescent brain , the researchers said			2
but not so fast , says an analysis published online monday by the @entity40			0
@entity41 of the @entity42 in @entity43 , says the @entity45 trend might have nothing to do with pot. rather , it may have emerged from differences among the study participants in socioeconomic status , or @entity52 , which involves factors like income , education and occupation , he says			1
he based his paper on a computer simulation			0
it traced what would happen to iq scores over time if they were affected by differences in @entity52 in ways suggested by other research , but not by smoking marijuana			0
in an interview , @entity41 said he 's not claiming that his alternative explanation is definitely right , just that the methods and evidence in the original study are n't enough to rule it out			1
he suggested further analyses the researchers could do			0
the @entity29 scientists , who learned of @entity41 's analysis late last week , say they conducted new statistical tests to assess his proposed explanation			1
their verdict : it 's wrong			0
@entity29 replies : researchers from the prominent institution were among the first to discover the pot / iq link			1
they are now saying the @entity70 study is wrong @entity41 says they need to do still more work to truly rule it out			1
experts unconnected to the two papers said the @entity41 paper does n't overturn the original study			1
it ' raises some interesting points and possibilities , ' but provides ' speculation ' rather than new data based on real people , said dr. @entity110 , who studies alcohol and drug use in adolescents at the @entity114			0
dr. @entity115 , director of the @entity116 , said observational studies of people like the @entity29 work ca n't definitively demonstrate that marijuana cause irreversible effects on the brain			2
in an email , she said @entity41 's paper ' looks sound ' but does n't prove that his alternative explanation is correct			2

the new study out of @entity43 , @entity70 suggests socioeconomic factors are to blame for the apparent *correlation*
the research directly challenges a 2012 study by @entity29 researchers
@entity41 is n't claiming *victory* , but says his new study must be at least considered
@entity29 scientists react with *chagrin* , say @entity41 is wrong
