by @entity0 published : 15:11 est , 6 november 2013 updated : 15:03 est , 23 november 2013 victim of discrimination : @entity3 pictured arriving at her first employment tribunal in july this year a @entity6 banker was fired by a firm dubbed ‘ @entity11 ’ when she complained about bosses slashing her £ 95,000 - a - year salary to the £ 6.08 - an - hour minimum wage because she was a woman			1
@entity3 , 42 , told a tribunal how sexist managers at @entity14 stripped her of lucrative client accounts			1
she said that boss @entity16 gave the best business to ' his boys ' , who could bond with male clients over beer , rugby and hunting			2
another manager referred to her as ' sweetheart ' and male colleagues compared their firm to the notorious sex parties of @entity31 ’s @entity30 in emails discussing ‘ bunga bunga ’ , the tribunal heard			1
when miss @entity3 alleged gender discrimination over the sudden , £ 80,000 cut to her basic salary , she was fired the very next working day			1
a panel at @entity39 employment tribunal found that she suffered sex discrimination , victimisation and unfair dismissal			2
it ruled that @entity44 ' falsely claimed that there had been a real investigation ' into miss @entity3 ’s discrimination complaint			1
it noted that the firm would not let her approach her key contacts when they moved firms to drum up new business - but expected her to introduce her clients to new colleagues			1
and a poorly performing male colleague had staged reductions to his salary rather than being put on the then @entity60 hourly minimum wage of £ 6.08			1
miss @entity3 is now set to receive substantial compensation from @entity44 for lost earnings and injury to feelings			1
in its judgment , the panel ruled : ' looking at the evidence as a whole - and particularly the difference in treatment between the claimant and her colleagues - there is evidence from which we could infer , in the absence of an adequate explanation , that the claimant has been subject to sex discrimination in her dismissal and the process leading up to it			2
' the boss : @entity85 ' @entity84 pictured in july			2
the firm says it will appeal against the tribunal 's findings it added : ' we find that the claimant ’s gender was a factor in @entity44 ’s decision to dismiss her			1
' in particular , we find that when the claimant ’s figures reduced , mr @entity16 was less willing to assist her to gain alternative clients than he would have been had she been a man			2
' speaking after the judgment , miss @entity3 ’s solicitor @entity100 , of law firm @entity101 , said : ' the tribunal had a full view of all the evidence and came to its decision , which vindicates @entity3 and she is delighted by the decision			1

miss @entity3 became an executive director for @entity44 , in charge of @entity124 equity sales			1
giving evidence , she said : ' there were many comments about bunga bunga			2
that was done all the time			2
' i kept my head down and worked rather than listening but there were also emails sent around , such as the reference to @entity135 as ‘ bunga bunga securities ’ ( when bunga bunga refers to erotic parties with sexual favours dispensed to men by women ) which to my mind was demeaning			0
' i could n’t believe this was being sent around			0
of course i was offended by this kind of thing			0
' in each of 2009 and 2010 , miss @entity3 made around £ 1.2 million in revenue for the investment bank			1

' and then the boys in the office would shout ‘ @entity158 , @entity158 ’			0
she had to prepare his lunch every day in the kitchen			0
' i remember a couple of occasions when he told me : " @entity3 , i do n’t understand why my wife works			1
i bring in the money			0
" things like that really shocked me			0
' miss @entity3 said her plight worsened when another boss , @entity172 , stripped her of more accounts and called her ‘ sweetheart ’			1
he said he was handing over her @entity177 accounts to @entity178 because the clients were all ‘ boyos ’			0
she said : ' he called the @entity177 a bunch of lying , cheating , stealing time - wasters			0
he then went on to explain it is mostly about beer and rugby in @entity177 , and so he thought i should be removed from the @entity177 accounts and they should be given to mr @entity178 who could take the clients to rugby matches			0
' it was also said that it would not be appropriate for her to join male clients on hunting trips			0
but mr @entity196 insisted he only removed her from the @entity177 accounts because she was ' irrelevant and unknown ' to the clients			0
he said his comments were a light - hearted attempt to take her off the accounts without hurting her feelings			0
mr @entity16 told the tribunal that @entity108 was ' caught up in a fantasy of her own making ' after being abandoned by her core client base			1
miss @entity3 said she ' begged ' to be given more accounts and be allowed to contact potential clients but was ' ignored '			1
