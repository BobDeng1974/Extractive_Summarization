" in these conditions and despite the efforts of the medical staff , who i thank sincerely , my absence was inevitable			0
" coach @entity26 said in a press conference screened on the @entity18 's official website : " it 's a sad day			2

he had hoped to rejoin the full squad on friday but @entity26 said : " we increased the intensity of his work but this morning , before he could join the collective training , he stopped dead on a movement with a sharp pain			1
" as of today , everything leads us to believe that he will be unable to train for several weeks , and still less able to play			0
" regarding @entity9 , he added : " he had a groin problem in the second half of the season but had an operation and returned for the last match			2
" he played in the ( warm - up ) matches against @entity83 and @entity84 and on wednesday he trained as normal , thursday morning as well , but on thursday afternoon in the game he felt a violent pain in his right adductor and had to leave the session			0

but i have other players			0
" part of my job is to anticipate things and try out different options			0
there are lots of possibilities			0
( @entity141 ) @entity140 has done some good things			0
" with @entity0 at 100 per cent , we are better			2
but we have to be ambitious and we will continue to be			0
" @entity0 added : " i depart from my team - mates with a heavy heart but i know they will do all they can for the blue jersey and go as far as possible in the competition			2
i will be their number one supporter			0
" @entity152 star @entity140 , @entity12 and @entity123 's @entity109 will provide the wide options for @entity26			1
