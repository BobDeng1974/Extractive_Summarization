by @entity0 @entity1 : 11:58 est , 20 december 2013 @entity2 : 12:21 est , 20 december 2013 for most of us , tomorrow 's @entity4 is little more than another chilly december day			1
but for @entity6 , 55 , from @entity7 in @entity8 , it has a much deeper meaning			1
for @entity6 is a white witch , and for him , and others like him , the shortest day of the year is one of the most important			1
the reason , explains @entity6 , is because the day marks the turn of the season , the rebirth of the sun and the slow march towards warmer summer days			1
nature : @entity6 taps into the power in the atmosphere around him as he prepares for an outdoor ceremony ' the main thing will be to celebrate rebirth of the sun , ' he explains			1
' i will be lighting a big bonfire to welcome the sun back			1
' but @entity6 's day wo n't end there			1
as the self - described high priest of @entity31 witches , his day will also involve another ceremony - a hand - fasting or pagan marriage			1
' it 's basically a nice little ceremony , ' he elaborates			2
' a circle will be cast in my garden , although at moment with forecast , it looks like it will be in my living room instead , for the four elements of air , fire , earth and water			0
' the couple will be wearing robes and will be inside the circle with me			0
it 's spiritually binding like a @entity54 marriage - the only difference is that there 's no pagan divorce ceremony ! ' the handfasting will be followed by a feast for @entity6 and 30 guests , complete with lashings of wine , to celebrate the @entity4			1
important : @entity6 is the high priest of @entity31 witches and also conducts hand - fasting ceremonies important : candles are a favourite tool for spell - casting and are particularly precious at the @entity4 ' they range from policemen to housewives , ' adds @entity6			1
' people bring what they want to eat and we 'll have a mini feast			0
' it 's a far cry from @entity6 's usual day , which involves channelling his power for the benefit of supplicants from all over the world with problems that only a white witch can solve			1
most , he admits , involve mending broken relationships and finding lost pets , although he also reveals that there are some requests that he simply wo n't entertain			0
' the most common request is to do with relationship break ups , ' he explains			0
' there are lots of women who are married to people having affairs			0
' quite a lot of them want to make the man 's willy stop working for anyone else			0
if i hear all of the circumstances and i feel that what i 've heard is genuine , then i 'll help but i 'm very strict about it			0
' i wo n't help people who 've been out and cheated on their partners and have decided they want them back or anyone who has been violent			2
' most of the rituals he performs , all of which are unique to him , involve lighting candles or using crystals - both of which he has been doing since he was 16			1
' the first spell i ever did was when i was 16 and it was to find someones lost cat , ' he remembers			0
' the lady lived by the marina and was convinced the cat had died			0
@entity4 : the @entity4 is celebrated by pagans like @entity6 with bonfires to welcome the reborn sun service : another part of @entity6 's work is infusing crystals with energy aimed at tackling illness and infertility ' i did my hocus pocus and lit a candle over a photo of the cat , and three days later , she called me and said " you have to come down here and see this "			1
' ' i went along to her basement flat and found eight to nine cats sitting outside - including her own			2
' other popular services include charms to boost fertility , the removal of jinxes caused by intense hatred or black magic , and getting rid of unwanted paranormal visitors			2
for now , @entity6 is looking forward to the coming holiday , which he says , also shines a light on the origins of @entity31 @entity154 traditions			1
' in [ pre-christian ] pagan culture , people used to light fires and candles to celebrate the rebirth of the sun. ' later , of course , the @entity161 replaced the rebirth of the sun with the birth of @entity165 but most of what we do at @entity154 is pagan			2
' and what will he be doing on christmas day ? ' i 'll be chilling out and watching the telly like everyone else ! ' for more on @entity6 and his work , visit kevthewitch.co.uk ' it 's a particularly good time to wish for improved relationships as well as help with fertility problems , ' explains @entity6			2
' and it 's nice to put a bit of holly and mistletoe around your candle too			0
' what to do get a brand new candle and place it inside a circle made from a piece of string or in a round bowl			0
visualise your wish and light the candle just before 5.11pm on the 21st			0
as you light it visualise your wish and say ' as i make my wish , be it done , speed it well , power to the sun '			2
blow out the candle and as the smoke rises , visualise your wish going out to the world .			0

@entity6 , 55 , from @entity8 is a self - described witch
he has been practising magic since he was just five years old
the @entity4 is an important *festival* for witches and pagans
most celebrate by lighting bonfires to welcome back the reborn sun
