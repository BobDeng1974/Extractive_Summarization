by @entity0 published : 12:48 est , 23 august 2013 updated : 14:29 est , 23 august 2013 seven years after conjoined twin girls from @entity3 were separated in an operation that had never been performed before , they are happy and healthier than ever			1
@entity6 are now 11 - years - old and are living active lives with their younger twin brothers , big sister and parents in @entity11 , they told the @entity12			1
they were four when their parents , @entity15 and @entity16 , made the agonizing decision to separate them after they were born fused at the mid-torso and sharing two legs			1
the 26 - hour surgery in august 2006 was the first time the operation had ever been performed on twins sharing a kidney , but it was successful - and little @entity26 was given a kidney transplant from her mother months later			1
the girls were born joined at the chest strong : the girls were born sharing two legs and now have one leg each , but are working with prosthetics the girls , who had shared an abdomen , pelvis , liver , kidney , large intestine and two legs , were left with one leg each			1
after six weeks at the hospital , they returned home and had their bandages changed three times a week , a job which took two hours for each child			2
@entity26 also needed extra nutrition through a feeding tube , and underwent dialysis three times a week to prepare for her new kidney , which she received in april 2007			2
now 11 , they are ' healthier than ever , but prone to infections because of the titanium rods in their backs ' , their mother @entity15 said as they appeared on the @entity12			1
early years : the girls , who are now 11 , shared an abdomen , pelvis , liver , kidney , large intestine and two legs happy : the twins , pictured before their separation , underwent a 26 - hour operation in august 2006 @entity73 family : @entity16 and @entity74 pose with their eldest daughter @entity75 , twins @entity6 and @entity26 , and second set of twins @entity79 and @entity81 at their home in @entity3 before the separation roughly one out of every 200,000 live births worldwide results in conjoined twins , according to the @entity87			1
around 40 to 60 per cent of conjoined twins arrive stillborn , and about 35 per cent survive only one day			2
the overall survival rate of conjoined twins is between 5 per cent and 25 per cent , the @entity89 reported			2
the condition is three times more likely to occur among females than males and a third of conjoined twins are attached at the lower chest , sharing organs			0
chances of successful surgery and survival are greater if the twins have separate sets of organs , experts say			0
although success rates have improved over the years , surgical separation is still rare			0
since 1950 , at least one twin has survived separation about 75 percent of the time			0
after separation , most twins need intensive rehabilitation because of the malformation and position of their spines			0
source @entity6 and @entity26 have surgeries to straighten their spines every six months and undergo daily physical therapy			1
they are also learning how to use crutches and prosthetic limbs			2
and they do not let anything stop them ; in a clip that aired on @entity33 's ' where they are now ? ' segment on sunday , the girls giggled as they talked about their busy lives			1
on their @entity131 page , the @entity132 , they are pictured enjoying days out at swimming pools , jumping on trampolines and visiting amusement parks with their friends and siblings			0
' i like swimming , playing with friends , riding bikes , jumping on the tramp [ oline ] , ' @entity6 says in the clip on the @entity33 show			1
' eating , ' @entity26 adds			0
' yeah , eating ! ' @entity6 says			1
the girls even stayed upbeat as they talked about how their surgeries ' stink ' and how they miss seeing their dog when they go to the hospital			2
their mother keeps friends , family and strangers updated on the girls ' progress on their family blog			2
loved : the family were worried about the separation because the twins shared the same kidney success ! they are seen leaving the @entity89 for home in september 2007 beautiful : they are pictured after the operation			0
' their wills are so strong , ' her mother said afterwards ' @entity6 and @entity26 are so happy ! ! they have so many people that love them so much			1
their smiles light up a room , ' @entity15 wrote in one entry			0
' they have taught me so much about being who i need to			0
and taking one day at a time			0
' it took them years to recover from their separation surgery , and it takes them sometimes weeks to recover from other surgeries and sicknesses			0
they take everything in stride and they move forward			0
' the girls have had this drive since the very beginning			2
five months after they were separated , they met @entity33 for the first time and their mother spoke of their determination			1
active : the @entity74 twins said they love swimming , cycling and bouncing on their trampoline all smiles : the girls said they hate undergoing operations to straighten their spines but remain positive fighters : the 11 - year - old girls are now learning how to walk with prosthetic legs and the use of crutches standing tall : they undergo physical therapy every day and surgeries every six months to straighten their spines ' their wills are so strong , ' @entity15 said at the time			1
