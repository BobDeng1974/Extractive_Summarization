by @entity0 last updated at 2:42 pm on 16th december 2011 the unmanned @entity2 spy plane captured by @entity3 appears to be a fake , a former @entity6 official has claimed			1
it is the wrong colour and the welding along the wing joints does not appear to conform to the stealth design that helps it avoid radar detection , he said			1
but @entity2 military officials have told @entity14 the drone was on a surveillance mission of suspected nuclear sites in the country			1
they said it was a @entity2 bat - winged @entity33 and boasted they guided it down electronically by hacking into its gps system			1
but the @entity40 worker , who does not wish to be named , questioned why the landing gear was covered up when displayed by the @entity3 military			2
the drone 's underside is obscured with banners that read : ' we 'll trample @entity2 underfoot ' and ' the @entity2 can not do a damn thing			0
' on wednesday , state tv reported that data was still be recovered by @entity3 engineers from the @entity33 , which is regularly used in stealth missions			2
the day before , another @entity2 drone , the @entity53 , reportedly crashed at @entity55 on the island of @entity57 after developing engine problems			0
captured : @entity3 says it will not return the @entity33 reconnaissance drone that crashed in @entity3 this week according to the @entity61 , @entity3 scientists guided the @entity33 to ground by ' spoofing ' its gps coordinates - tricking the plane into landing in @entity3 territory instead of where it was programmed to touch down			1
an article in the @entity61 quoted an unnamed @entity3 engineer who claimed he had been studying the inner workings of the captured @entity33			2
he said the ' spoofing ' technique made the craft ' land on its own where we wanted it to , without having to crack the remote - control signals and communications ' from the @entity2 control centre			0
monitor writer @entity78 and an @entity3 journalist publishing under the pen name @entity81 said the gps weakness of aircraft has long been known to @entity2 military officials			1
they cited a 2003 report titled @entity87 that appears to warn of the type of attack claimed by the @entity3 engineer			2
' a more pernicious attack involves feeding the gps receiver fake gps signals so that it believes it is located somewhere in space and time that it is not , ” says the report			0
' this attack is more elegant than jamming because it is surreptitious			0
' the drone is used for covert surveillance such as the operation to spy on the @entity101 compound of @entity102 before he was killed in a @entity2 raid in may			0
@entity2 officials have blamed the loss of the sophisticated spy plane on a malfunction , but have yet to explain how it was in such pristine condition after its recovery by the @entity3			2
@entity2 and @entity111 officials have said it was on a mission to patrol the @entity114 - @entity3 border and had veered off course when it went missing			2
now military officials have told @entity14 that the @entity114 government was unaware of the use of its territory to fly surveillance drones over @entity3			1
the @entity120 had not informed the @entity6 of the drone 's mission when reports first emerged that it had crashed			0
one official told the station that the @entity2 military ' did not have a good understanding of what was going on because it was a @entity120 mission			0
' in @entity131 , @entity2 defence secretary @entity130 did not deny that it had been spying on @entity3 and said the drone programme carried out ' important intelligence operations which we will continue to pursue			1
' the @entity33 is one of the @entity2 ' most sophisticated spy planes and flies at up to 50,000 feet			0
it is designed to evade sophisticated air defenses			0
one former intelligence official told @entity14 that it 's ' impossible to see ' and discounted @entity3 claims that it had been brought down by some form of electronic counter-measures			1
' it simply fell into their laps , ' he said - after satellite communication was lost			0
@entity3 officials have said the drone came down over eastern @entity3 , hundreds of miles from the cluster of nuclear sites in the central and north - west of the country			1
graphic : the @entity33 was reportedly used to watch former @entity154 leader @entity102 during the @entity156 mission that killed him they believe they can ' mass produce ' the captured drone by ' reverse engineering ' the aircraft			0
meanwhile , @entity3 member of parliament has hit back at former @entity2 vice president @entity164 , who said president @entity165 should have ordered an airstrike into @entity3 to destroy the drone and deny @entity3 access to its technology			1
@entity170 told @entity171 , @entity3 's state media agency : ' the @entity3 … can give a crushing response and cut off hands of anyone who wants to violate its air , navy and land borders			1
' @entity164 said the @entity3 will likely ' send ( the drone ) back in pieces after they 've gotten all the intelligence they can out of it			2
' @entity130 said he did not believe @entity3 would agree to the @entity2 request for the drone 's return but told @entity185 that the stealth missions along the @entity3 - @entity114 border would ' absolutely ' continue			1
he added : ' our request for return of the drone is an appropriate request , ' @entity130 said			0
' i do n't expect that will happen , but i think it 's important to make that request			0

wrong colour and wrong welding on wing joints
we hacked into gps system to bring it down , says @entity3
drone was looking for nuclear sites , @entity14 told
