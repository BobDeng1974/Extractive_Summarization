@entity0 called it the ‘ @entity8 hump ’ and for certain @entity5 players the chief executive ’s words might be tweaked to read ‘ taking the hump ’			1
it ’s to his credit that , with typical candour , @entity11 admits he had teething problems with the regime change that saw @entity15 walk into @entity5 intent on wholesale reform			1
@entity0 knew that by appointing the @entity18 in the wake of @entity21 ’s resignation he was taking a risk , and recently likened the gamble to @entity24 ’ decision to install @entity26 in 2006			2
after a difficult start , @entity11 has now build a strong relationship with @entity5 manager @entity15 the @entity29 lasted barely six months at @entity30 and departed in the wake of a dressing - room revolt			1
yet , while the likes of @entity36 and @entity37 actively railed against @entity26 ’s methods , the resistance to @entity15 ’s changes was more subtle			1
there was , however , bemusement that the club should seek to change the winning formula that had seen @entity21 land three titles in a row alongside consecutive qualifications for the @entity48 group stage			2
having clinched the major @entity50 honours and scored 32 times last season , commons more than most was perhaps entitled to feel his game had little need for refinement			1
he readily admits to feeling unsettled by the changes that saw the former @entity60 chief place a greater emphasis on fitness as he attempted to realise a high - tempo pressing game			1
as with most human squabbles , communication has proved the key to a solution			1
@entity15 ’s policy of regularly sitting down to speak individually with his players has given commons a right of reply and he has used it , returning to first - team prominence and signing a new contract last month			1
commons has adapted well to the manager 's demands of his players to be physically fitter than before commons is likely to start the @entity79 and has declared himself all in as @entity15 bids to win his first trophy as @entity5 manager			1
‘ it is always difficult when you feel like you ’ve come off a season doing really well then someone comes in and wants to change things , as he sees it , for the better , ’ he said			2
‘ but through that transitional period we got knocked out the @entity48 and did n’t get off to a great start in the league			2
it had an effect on the park			2
‘ i was n’t playing every week and , when i was in , i ’d try to do the things the manager wanted			2
in recent weeks , when i have been fit and healthy , i ’ve felt like a different player and added more to my game than usual			2
‘ we speak one - to - one on a regular basis about what he wants and what i want			0
he ’s good that way , super			0
he ’s not telling me anything i do n’t know already , it ’s just sometimes you need a push in the right direction to make you a better player			0
’ @entity110 , articulate and possessed with a healthy sense of his own ability , @entity11 is one of the bigger characters in the dressing room and it was always crucial that @entity15 found a way to bring the @entity119 - born attacking midfielder on side			1
even @entity21 had a rocky spell with @entity11 during the player ’s first full season at the club but the pair went on to forge a productive working relationship to the extent that the @entity128 admitted he would happily take commons off @entity15 ’s hands as he settled into his new job at @entity133			1
commons talks with captain @entity135 in training ahead of the @entity137 cup final on sunday a return to the @entity139 , where the 31 - year - old had performed comfortably and without the incessant pressure to win inherent at @entity5 , would have been an easier and possibly more lucrative option			1
‘ i ’m not looking for an easy way out , ’ he contends			0
‘ i was n’t looking just to plod away through these next two or three years			1
i have a lot of goals for myself — to win more trophies , more cups			0
i want to win a @entity149 and play in the @entity48 these next couple of years			1
i ’ve not signed a deal where i think : “ oh , that ’s great , i can get my feet up ”			0
‘ the manager will put pressure on me to keep improving , so i ’ve got to show signs of doing that and that ’s one of my goals — i want to get better as a player as i get older			2
’ commons admits he is ‘ three to four kilos ’ lighter thanks to @entity15 ’s demands that his players cut their body fat and admits he feels fitter as a result			1
where @entity21 would borrow from the likes of @entity168 in allowing his players to freewheel on the proviso that they delivered on matchdays , @entity15 demands that , in his own words , his players are 24 - hour athletes			1
commons is desperate to win the competition , which has eluded him in his four years in @entity173 he may never boast a physique to rival @entity175 or @entity176 , but he has bought into the new manager ’s philosophy — and regards the november win at @entity180 as a pivotal moment for the new boss			1
‘ i think @entity183 away was a big result , when big @entity185 ) scored in the last minute			0
i think that was a turning point			0
even before that game we saw the benefits on the training field			0
‘ we are trying to play this high pressing game and everyone is looking to try and improve as much as possible , whether that is a 19 - year - old kid that ’s just come in or me at 31			0
‘ the manager wants everyone to make targets to get fit , get healthier , make better touches , make better decisions on the ball and things like that			2
it is just completely different from last year			0
‘ then if you were doing well , it was a case of just keeping doing what you were doing			0
‘ @entity175 , is this supreme athlete			0
he ’s the pinnacle , is n’t he — he is the quickest , he can jump highest , he can score most goals			0
he probably has no fat			0
that is the target , so whatever i am over that , that is the target			0
‘ that is not just myself			0
even @entity215 has had words about it , @entity218 and @entity219 , too			0
‘ the manager has goals and aspirations			0
he wants to makes us better , not only as professionals , but as a team			2
he wants us to dominate domestically and then take that on to the @entity228 stage next year — and not just take part there , but put pressure on teams , especially away from home			2
‘ i think @entity234 away we showed signs we are getting there			0
even though we were down to 10 men , we showed a really gutsy performance			0
’ @entity239 and the @entity79 provided @entity11 with a glorious @entity5 debut yet , four years later , he is still waiting to get his hands on the trophy in celebration			1
commons is battling a hamstring injury but hopes to be fit in time to face @entity246 on sunday having completed his £ 300,000 move from @entity249 a day earlier , commons took just eight minutes to rifle home his first @entity5 goal in the 2011 semi-final against @entity183			1
yet although his spectacular strike set the tone for a largely fulfilling period of his career , he went on to suffer disappointment in the final as @entity24 prevailed courtesy of @entity261 ’s goal in extra-time			0
a year later and caught in a personal form slump , he was a substitute and restricted to the final four minutes as @entity5 unsuccessfully tried to equalise @entity266 ’s shock winning goal for @entity267			1
the past two seasons have seen @entity269 and @entity270 provide further misery as the trophy became the one honour to escape the clutches of @entity21			0
the glaring absence from his own medal collection was just one of the reasons @entity173 ’s reigning @entity50 elected to sign a new contract in january and put an end to persistent talk that he was on his way out of the club			2
a hamstring injury has dogged commons since he penned his new deal last month but he ’s trained this week and , with @entity287 and @entity288 cup - tied , he looks a good bet to claim one of three attacking midfield slots in @entity15 ’s team to face @entity246			1
‘ i feel fine and i ’m looking forward to playing — if selected , ’ said @entity11			1
‘ it ’s the only cup i ’ve not won in @entity173 , so it ’s a big deal			0
‘ i think @entity135 is the only member of the squad who has won it			1

@entity11 has been a key member of @entity5 squad for four years
commons admits he struggled when @entity15 arrived
@entity15 put *increased* emphasis on fitness in new regime
but @entity11 has met his targets and is now back in the first team
