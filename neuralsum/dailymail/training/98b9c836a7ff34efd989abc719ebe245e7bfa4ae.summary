@entity0 became the ' most hated mother in @entity2 ' during her two - month trial for the murder of two - year - old daughter , @entity0			1
now , defense attorney @entity7 , says that ‘ the world owes an apology , ’ to the young mother whom he has described as having ‘ endured the unthinkable with the courage of a lion			1
’ it is three years since a @entity13 court acquitted @entity14 of the murder of toddler @entity0 whose skeletal remains were found six months after she went missing in june 2008			1
@entity0 , who was found not guilty of murdering her daughter three years ago , is seen with @entity7 last summer , presumably taken at her home in an undisclosed location in @entity13			1
@entity7 's new book ' justice in @entity2 ' has just been released ' chainless imprisonment ' : @entity0 's attorney says that despite her acquittal for the murder of her two - year - old daughter @entity0 , she 's still serving a heavy sentence today , with the publication of ‘ justice in @entity2 , ’ attorney mr @entity7 provides an excoriating insight into @entity14 ’s prosecution and mounts an impassioned defense of @entity14 with whom he and his wife , @entity36 , have formed a close relationship			1
in a forensic examination of the case , and the very notion of justice in @entity2 , he has slammed @entity43 ’s prosecution as ‘ corrupt ’ ; revealed how evidence was suppressed ; claimed defense witnesses were intimidated and told of his ‘ astonishment ’ at @entity14 ’s father , @entity49 ’s testimony in court			1
and he has revealed that , to this day , not only @entity14 lives ‘ like a prisoner ’ in an undisclosed location , afraid to go out and battling a bankruptcy case , but he , his wife , and other members of the defense team endure persistent and serious threats			0
according to mr @entity7 the @entity58 , @entity59 and @entity60 have all been called to investigate such threats			2
meanwhile @entity14 lives in a shared house , somewhere in @entity13 , attempting to make some sort of living through clerical work from home			0
speaking to @entity66 last week mr @entity7 revealed that @entity14 who accused her father of sexually molesting her , ‘ does not have any blood family anymore			1
’ instead he and his wife , @entity36 , have become surrogate parents of sorts to @entity14 who was 22 when the case was first brought to national attention in july 2008			0
no evidence : @entity7 says there was no forensic evidence linking @entity0 's car or her person to the death of her daughter by then toddler @entity0 had been missing for 31 days			1
her mother @entity83 and father @entity49 testified that @entity14 left the family house with her almost three - year - old daughter on 15 june			1
on 30 june the family car , being used by @entity14 , was towed and when @entity83 and @entity49 contacted their daughter she claimed she was on a mini-vacation in @entity91 , @entity13			1
she subsequently claimed that she had left the child with a babysitter and returned to find both mysteriously gone			0
when @entity0 ’s disappearance was discovered @entity14 claimed to have mounted an investigation of her own			2
on 15 july her mother @entity83 made three 911 calls , reporting her granddaughter as missing and infamously stating in one , ‘ i found my daughter ’s car today and it smelt like there had been a damn body in the car			1
’ it was , according to mr @entity7 , a statement never borne out by forensic evidence and yet , in spite of @entity14 ’s ultimate acquittal that statement continues to be a defining moment in the minds of many who reacted with outrage at the not guilty verdict			1
insight : despite being acquitted , @entity0 has not been forgiven the crime by the @entity2 public , who largely believe she got away with murder , says @entity7 in his new book in a methodical survey of the trial and coverage mr @entity7 has knocked down what he presents as prevailing myths that cling to the case and point to @entity14 ’s ‘ guilt ’			1
he has dismissed reports that @entity0 ’s head was bound in duct tape as a ‘ distortion ’ and untrue , pointed to the fact that no blood or incriminating stains were ever found in @entity14 ’s car , or clothes and no toxic substances found on @entity0 ’s hair , or dirt similar to that of the discovery site found on @entity14 ’s shoes or clothes			1
exactly where , and when , the body was found is , according to mr @entity7 a key and contentious point			2
@entity0 ’s remains were finally , officially , found in december 2008			2
in fact meter reader @entity150 first reported finding human remains there in august 2008			0
breathtakingly , mr @entity7 has pointed out , that the sheriff ’s office failed to follow up on the report at a time when the nation was gripped with the search for the toddler whom many hoped might still be alive			2
the area had already been searched on multiple occasions and mr @entity150 ’s report was dismissed			0
it was only his persistence and return to the site that led to law enforcement following through and the grim discovery being made official			0
according to mr @entity7 the fact that the exact location where @entity0 was discovered had been searched on multiple occasions before mr @entity150 ’s first report suggests that the body had not been missed – it just had n’t been there			1
he is clear in his assertion that the body had been placed there somewhere between the time of @entity14 ’s arrest and its discovery			0
as @entity14 could not possibly have done this from her jail cell mr. @entity7 points to this as proof of there having been another involved			2
the prosecution suggested that the area had been under water when initially searched			0
when their expert witness , an hydrologist , did not corroborate this theory , mr. @entity7 reveals , they simply did not call him			2
mr. @entity150 was not called either			0
similarly mr. @entity7 points to the prosecution ’s assertion that a software search programme had revealed that @entity14 had searched the word chloroform 84 times on her computer			2
though the cause of death has never been established this was presented as damning evidence			2
but the expert who had testified to this in court had also subsequently informed the prosecution that this was a mistake and that the data was wrong			0
in fact there was only one search			0
the defense team asked for that testimony to be removed and the jury made aware of the mistake			0
the motion was denied by a court that , according to mr. @entity7 , was prejudiced against @entity14 and caught up in the media circus that surrounded the trial from the start			2
vanished : when @entity219 s disappearance was discovered , @entity14 claimed to have mounted an investigation of her own public condemnation : @entity7 says that because of the prosecution and unfair media coverage , many believe @entity0 murdered her child , despite her being acquitted by a jury during the trial @entity13 attorney general @entity228 went on television and asserted her belief in @entity14 ’s guilt – conduct which mr. @entity7 has slammed as ‘ reprehensible , unethical and grossly unprofessional			1
’ in an amusing aside mr. @entity7 has revealed how he attempted to weed out potentially bias jurors with a simple enquiry as to whether or not they watched @entity238 ’s @entity237			0
an admission to doing so was enough to guarantee exclusion from the jury			0
on one occasion , mr. @entity7 writes : ‘ we noticed that ms. @entity237 herself was in the courtroom … during a round of interviewing that was already going very well , i said to the prospective juror , “ @entity249 , i realize that the question i ’m about to ask you , and your answer , may prove to be very embarrassing to yourself ; but remember , no one here knows your name , nor can they see your face , and i do need to know the answer			0
” ’ pausing for effect in the now silent courtroom mr. @entity7 pressed on , ‘ @entity262 , as hard as it might be to admit , do you watch @entity237 ? ” ’ when the woman answered , ‘ no ’ to spontaneous laughter in the court ms. grace ‘ stormed out slamming the door			0
’ but there were few moments of levity in the case that held the nation in thrall and exerts a powerful hold over the popular imagination to this day			0
one of the most shocking days , for mr. @entity7 , was the very opening of the trial when defense attorney @entity278 set out @entity14 ’s allegations that her father had abused her and the prosecution called @entity43 to the stand and asked him about the claims made in mr. @entity278 ’s opening statement			1
@entity43 testified that he was ‘ appalled ’ by the allegations , which he claimed never to have heard before			0
two and a half years earlier when the jail letters containing the allegations first became known , mr. @entity7 has no revealed that he called @entity43 into his office to inform him of them ‘ man to man			1
’ convoluted : defense attorney @entity291 displays a crime scene photo during the 2011 trial			1
@entity7 says a man reported a body in the area where @entity0 's body was found but police failed to follow it up most hated woman in @entity2 : @entity0 ( pictured after being acquitted ) and her defense team still receive threats , three years after she was found not guilty to mr. @entity7 ’s great surprise @entity43 did not react , at all			1
he then called in @entity14 ’s mother , @entity83 , to tell her of her daughter ’s claims			0
in a meeting which he has now described as ‘ one of the most uncomfortable of my career , ’ mrs. @entity306 wept openly at her daughter ’s claims			0
in what mr. @entity7 refers to as a ‘ parade of truth ’ he points to the witness who took to the stand admitting a long - term affair with @entity43 and stating that ‘ @entity0 ’s death was an accident that snowballed out of control			1
’ but @entity14 ’s acquittal has had little impact on the public hostility which still burns fiercely and sees @entity14 living a life ‘ in hiding ’ to this day			0
as an example of her ‘ courage ’ and innocence mr. @entity7 points to the fact that the most vocal opponent of a plea deal , in a case in which conviction could mean the death penalty , was @entity14 herself			2
after just 11 hours of deliberation the jury acquitted @entity14 of the murder charges and convicted her on four counts of lying to detectives			0
ultimately the court reversed two of the four counts but by then @entity14 had already served time for the wrongful convictions			0
in january 2013 she filed for bankruptcy claiming about $ 1,100 in assets and $ 792,000 in @entity345 she lives in an undisclosed location in @entity13 in what mr. @entity7 describes as ‘ her present chainless imprisonment			1
’ ' justice in @entity2 : how the @entity351 and prosecutors stack the @entity353 ' by @entity7 is out today , published by @entity354 $ 24.95			1

' justice in @entity2 ' by defense attorney @entity7 out today
