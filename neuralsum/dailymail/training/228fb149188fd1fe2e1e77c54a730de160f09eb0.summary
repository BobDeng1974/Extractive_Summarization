as a professional dancer , @entity0 is used to pushing his body - and , apart from an occasional sniffle , it 's served him well			1
' i had a few colds , but nothing serious			2
i was always on the dancefloor , which kept me in good shape , ' says the 33 - year - old , who has appeared on @entity10 since 2011 , partnering celebrities such as singer @entity13 and , in the new series , countdown 's @entity14			1
but it was this hard - working lifestyle , he believes , which led to a bout of illness so severe it could have cost him his life			2
in step : @entity10 partners @entity14 and @entity0 in 2006 , @entity0 was living in @entity25 , where he came down with a sore throat - accompanied by fever , heavy limbs , trouble swallowing and extreme fatigue			1
' i assumed it was just a common cold , ' says @entity0 , who is from @entity32			1
but over the course of six days he became so ill his friend called an ambulance			2
after a battery of tests , he was diagnosed with @entity39 's syndrome			1
a complication of tonsillitis , it causes inflammation in the head or neck			1
the condition causes the bacteria infecting the throat to get into the jugular vein - – the main vein that runs through the neck and connects the head to the heart			1
this leads to the lining of the vessel becoming inflamed , disrupting the flow of blood and triggering the formation of a blood clot , which is infected with the bacteria			2
after a scan found @entity0 had a blood clot , doctors told him there was a danger of it spreading into his brain , where it could result in a stroke			1
he was given antibiotics and blood - thinners to try to prevent it from getting bigger so his body could break it down			2
another potential risk is of bacteria escaping into the bloodstream within broken pieces of clot or independently			2
this could lead to life - threatening blood poisoning , or septicaemia			0
hooked up to drips and unable to eat solid food , @entity0 lost 20lb in less than a fortnight and felt weak , but he stayed positive			1
' i am quite chilled out and my attitude was : “ if the blood clot moves , it moves , but for now i am still here			0
” ' deceptive : @entity0 thought he had a minor cold , but after a slew of tests he was diagnosed with @entity39 's syndrome , a complication of tonsillitis thankfully , @entity0 's clot did dissolve and he was discharged from hospital within three weeks - but he was left with a weakened immune system for months			1
though @entity39 's is rare , complications stemming from throat infections are not uncommon			1
' sore throats are more common than any other type of infection , ' says @entity104 , ear , nose and throat ( @entity109 ) consultant and spokesman for @entity109 @entity111			1
' though the majority will be nothing to worry about , if it gets nasty , bacteria can get into the bloodstream , make you very sick and interfere with the function of organs			0
in exceptional circumstances , they can cause septicaemia , which can lead to death			0
' the three main structures of the throat that can feel sore are the larynx ( voice box ) , pharynx ( the throat ) and tonsils			1
inflammation of these areas are known as laryngitis , pharyngitis and tonsillitis			1
the latter is the most common , with most children experiencing it at least once			0
experts are warning that tonsillitis is on the rise , and this is causing an increase in a condition called quinsy			1
this is a complication of tonsillitis , and causes pus to develop between the tonsils and the back of the throat			1
' @entity151 is common , ' says mr @entity104			0
' we see two or three cases a week where i work , and there are 6,000 admissions for quinsy across the country every year			0
we 're seeing more as we witness a reduction in the number of tonsillectomies			0
' as well as a painful abscess ( up to the size of a walnut ) and sore throat , patients with quinsy may have trouble swallowing , which can lead to drooling , bad breath and an earache			1
if the infection gets into the bloodstream , it could lead to rigors ( shivering ) , though doctors are unsure why , says @entity109 surgeon @entity178 , of @entity179			0
' cases have increased two to three times in the past few years compared to previously , ' says mr @entity178			0
' it 's not just more common , it is also more severe			1
' i see more complications , such as the pus spreading			0
if it gets to the spinal cord , it could potentially cause paralysis			0
' in the past year i 've seen three major complications of quinsy			0
when i started 25 years ago , you 'd see it once every couple of years			0
' he puts the increase down to gps prescribing fewer antibiotics for sore throats - due to concerns over antibiotic resistance - as well as fewer children having their tonsils removed			0
' the government is keen to reduce the costs of surgery			0
previously , the decision on whether you 'd benefit from a tonsillectomy was made by the gp , ' says mr @entity178			0
we see two or three cases a week where i work , and there are 6,000 admissions for quinsy across the country every year			0
we 're seeing more as we witness a reduction in the number of tonsillectomies			0
' ' now it 's increasingly more difficult for @entity197 to refer patients for tonsillectomies			1
you need to have many more episodes of tonsillitis - usually seven a year - before you have the operation			2
' but quinsy is n't the only complication of a sore throat			2
a quarter of children with throat infections will have a middle ear infection , or glue ear , where the fluid between the inner ear and eardrum becomes infected by bacteria			1
' the bacteria can spread up the eustacian tube , which connects the back of the throat to the ear , ' says mr @entity178			2
' it can also happen when the tonsils and andenoids - lumps of tissue above the tonsils - swell up , blocking off this tube and meaning you ca n't ventilate it properly			0
this can lead to hearing loss			0
fortunately , it 's reversible			2
' another potentially serious , but thankfully rare , complication arising from a throat infection is scarlet fever - characterised by a distinctive pinkish rash - and rheumatic fever , which leads to joint pain and swelling , and inflammation of the heart			1
these conditions develop in response to so - called ' strep throat ' - a throat infection caused by streptococcal bacteria			2
throat infections can also result in glomerulonephritis - an inflammation of the kidneys that can ultimately lead to renal failure			1
it can be caused by the immune system attacking healthy tissue as a consequence of the infection			0
and research has even pointed to a link between throat infections caused by the streptococcal bacteria and obsessive compulsive disorder ( @entity286 ) , characterised by anxious thoughts and repetitive behaviours such as handwashing			1
@entity290 : @entity0 , pictured with @entity13 , says ' now if i push myself , i make sure i have time to recuperate ' a 2009 study from @entity293 concluded some cases of @entity286 could be caused by the body 's attempt to attack the bacteria			1
one theory is that antibodies made by the body to attack the bacteria react with parts of the brain			0
however , many experts are unconvinced of the link			2
despite the potential complications of a sore throat , mr @entity104 stresses most are minor and unlikely to lead to a serious problem			2
' if it 's an isolated sore throat , i would n't be too stressed , ' he says			1
' but if you also have joint pain , which could indicate bacteria spreading into the bloodstream , muscle ache , a temperature , headache and you feel really rotten , give it up to 48 hours and do the sensible things , such as taking on fluids , painkillers and anti-inflammatories			0
' but if you feel worse after 48 hours , consider seeing your gp			0
' after @entity0 recovered from @entity39 's , he decided to stop putting himself through gruelling dance competitions and concentrate on performing in shows			1
this led him into the world of tv via the @entity329 version of @entity330 , where the @entity10 producers spotted him			0
' for most of us , if everything is going well , you take things for granted - and that includes your health , ' says @entity0			1
' now if i push myself , i make sure i have time to recuperate			0
strictly can be intense , so i go on holiday as soon as it 's over			2
