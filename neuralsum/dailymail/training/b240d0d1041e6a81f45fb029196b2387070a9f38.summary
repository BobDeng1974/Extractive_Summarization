the effect on her was catastrophic			0
' ( the burns ) covered 80 to 95 per cent of her body			0
injuries of that magnitude are just not survivable			0
' the jury was shown a video interview with another resident of @entity16 , @entity38 , who encountered @entity10 outside the flats holding a small axe and a plastic carrier bag			2
mr @entity38 rang police after @entity10 walked past him into the building and upstairs to miss @entity8 ’s flat			1
@entity46 footage played in court showed @entity10 using a screwdriver and the axe to try and break in , before @entity13 opened the door to him			1

she later died on the first day of the trial , @entity62 was shown disturbing footage of the night @entity8 , 35 , was fatally burned footage taken from a camera worn by a police officer showed miss @entity8 sitting in the lobby of the building - her clothes almost entirely burned off and her hair singed			1

@entity10 and @entity13 met last winter while they were both being treated at the ward of a local hospital for mental illness , mr @entity21 said			2

he bought her presents and asked her to spend @entity101 with him			0

when he was interviewed by police , @entity10 denied attacking miss @entity110 said she had been rolling a cigarette while he left her to go to the toilet and was already alight when he came out			2
