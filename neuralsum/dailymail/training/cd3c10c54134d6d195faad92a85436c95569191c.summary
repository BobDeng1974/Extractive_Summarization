published : 07:58 est , 11 october 2012 updated : 10:31 est , 11 october 2012 a hero @entity0 saved her owners ' lives by raising the alarm when a @entity5 caught fire			1
@entity7 says five - year - old @entity9 's barking alerted them to a blaze that swept through their home in @entity14 , @entity15			1
mr @entity7 , a hotel owner , said he was very proud of @entity9 , who raised the alarm and alerted his wife @entity17 to a ‘ terrifying ’ bathroom blaze			1
i 'm all right , @entity0 : @entity17 and her two daughters were able to flee after @entity9 raised the alarm gutted : the fire started in the jacuzzi and rapidly engulfed the bathroom			1
the family was unaware until @entity9 alerted them to the blaze she suffered smoke inhalation which made her breathless as she dialled 999			1
mr @entity7 , who was away at the time , said : ' the whole house could have gone			2
@entity9 really did save the day			2
' mrs @entity32 said she did not smell smoke as she settled down to watch television in her living room for a ' quiet ' friday night with daughters @entity36 and @entity38			0
' i had got myself comfortable and the girls were downstairs in their bedrooms , ' she said			0
' i did hear a bang , which i now know was some sort of cosmetic or deodorant exploding but at the time i put it down to the weather or fireworks			0
@entity9 obviously heard it though			0
' she kept barking and i thought she just wanted to go outside , but she was very agitated and would n’t give up - she knew something was wrong			1
' @entity51 : owner @entity7 says the dog saved his family 's life , calling the five - year - old @entity55 a ' hero '			1
eventually mrs @entity32 gave in to the canine 's yapping and found the fire in her en - suite bathroom			1
' i opened the door and the smoke and fumes just hit me			0
' it was terrifying but my main priority was to get the girls out			0
@entity9 already knew - she got herself out			2
' you hear of animals saving people ’s lives and that really was the case - she brought my attention to it and if she had n’t it could have been much worse			2
' the bedroom and bathroom have been left a shell , the whole house covered in a layer of soot , and mrs @entity32 lost her clothes to the fire			1
warning : fire officers say @entity9 's heroics would not have been needed if smoke alarms at the home were working ( stock image ) it has prompted fire officers to renew calls for people to test their smoke alarms			1
they said that had the alarms been working in the @entity7 household , the response would have been faster			0
mr @entity7 , who owns @entity103 , in @entity104 , @entity15 , was also told that had the fire started when his wife was asleep , she would have been dead without an alarm			2
mrs @entity32 said it was ‘ just an oversight ’ that the detectors were not in order			0
' of course now i will get a working smoke alarm fitted very soon			0
i would also say to other people , you just do not know when it is going to happen , ' she said .			0

' @entity118 ' would not stop barking while fire raged in bathroom
owner @entity17 and family were *oblivious* to the *danger* *enveloping* their home
