oh be still my beating heart			1
here we are , standing on the gravel outside the library doors at @entity5 , the @entity6 stately home in @entity7 that provides the ravishing setting for the television series , @entity10			1
we are on the very spot where @entity12 asked @entity13 to marry him in the first @entity14 special , broadcast in 2011			1
remember when the violins soared and snowflakes fell ? when @entity12 got down on one miraculously recovered knee to propose ? for many viewers , this was their all - time favourite @entity10 scene			1
‘ the crew were using ash to recreate the snow			1
it got inside the house and we had to spend ages dusting and cleaning the rooms			1
and the smell ! very acrid			1
we reached the point where we had to stop them doing it			1
’ @entity23 has always been quite frank about the travails of letting a film crew loose inside her beautiful home			1
on the plus side , there are the location fees and increased visitor traffic ; the crowds paying £ 20 a head to goggle at the splendour of her @entity27 interiors and the red velvet sofas where the @entity55 gather to take tea			1
it ’s like that show , @entity60 , ’ she says			1
on the downside , damage and disruption			1
‘ i do get annoyed when visitors chuck litter about , but my husband goes around picking it up			1
we fill black bags with the stuff			2
’ and since the very first day of @entity10 filming , when a technician smashed a much - loved green objet de vertu trinket box , she has been on red alert for transgressions			1
when she is not telling the crew that she pops open the champagne the minute they leave , she is issuing instructions on the correct way to move precious antique furniture			2
‘ you lift a girl in your arms and a chair by its bottom , ’ she will say			2
as @entity91 the butler ( ‘ oh , i adore him , he is divine ’ ) would no doubt agree , the problem with having high standards is that so few manage to live up to them			2
another who has incurred her displeasure is @entity97			2
the wealthy @entity99 designer and his family recently attended a swanky dinner at @entity27 , hosted by the @entity102 and @entity23			1
the @entity103 committed the social faux pas of taking numerous photographs of themselves grinning cheesily on the famous @entity106 , and elsewhere in sumptuous @entity27 , then proudly posting the snaps online			2
her ladyship was not best pleased			2
‘ my interpretation of dinner is having a meal and his interpretation is taking photographs			2
it seemed to get out of hand			2
i have to live with that			2
’ has she seen the pictures ? ‘ no and i do n’t want to , because i do n’t want to be irritated by them			2
my idea of a nice evening is having a conversation , not taking snaps			2
i have never knowingly taken a selfie , i am useless at photography			2
’ the @entity23 is the equivalent of @entity10 ’s @entity25 , played by @entity129 to whizz down the mile - long drive to @entity5 is to travel back in time to a more gracious age			1
the stately home made famous by @entity10 has been the ancestral seat of the @entity102 since 1679			1
flanked by elegant pines planted from seed three centuries ago , the house sits in a rolling landscape designed by @entity139			2
to look upon the soaring architecture of @entity27 is to understand the ambition and conceit of the old @entity6 upper classes , who once thought that life behind these ramparts of @entity148 stone , surrounded by @entity149 , @entity150 and walls covered in green @entity153 silk , would go on for ever			1
yet even the lavish lifestyle enjoyed by @entity155 and @entity29 in the fictional series is far removed from the realities of today			2
my dears , in the real @entity10 , the current chatelaine does n’t even have a lady ’s maid			1
‘ certainly not ! ’ she says			2
‘ and sadly not , because i would absolutely love one			2
’ in this house , with more than 300 rooms and ‘ about 80 ’ bedrooms , the servants ’ bellboard is still there outside the kitchen , just as it was over 100 years ago			0
but now , instead of tinkling bells , estate staff are summoned by the crackling walkie - talkie her ladyship carries in her hand			1
here , amid her six dogs , her horses , her staff and her husband , @entity23 gives the impression of a woman who reigns supreme			1
she was @entity183 before she married @entity184 , the @entity185 ’s godson and soon to be eighth @entity102 , 16 years ago			1
@entity183 was a foxy blonde and arch @entity186			0
the eldest of six sisters , she was raised in @entity190 , @entity191 , and is a trained accountant who once designed and sold crushed velvet evening wraps to other @entity186			0
only two years after they married , she and @entity184 took over @entity27 when the seventh @entity102 died			0
‘ then you understand that you marry the man and the house , ’ she says today			0
while her husband runs the estate , the jolly , sporty 52 - year - old has become the face and force of the real @entity10 , in charge of monetising the legacy from the popular tv show			1
in this , she has been enormously successful , writing two best - selling books about previous @entity207 wives ; @entity208 and @entity209			1
@entity23 gives the impression of a woman who reigns supreme , much like @entity213 's @entity212 of @entity29 she also gives talks all over the world			1
in @entity217 next month , the socialite @entity216 is hosting a champagne @entity219 where @entity217 fans of @entity10 can meet the countess over cake , all for the price of a £ 440 ticket			1
she is quite the draw , happy to take on the ambassadorial role while her husband stays in the background			0
right on cue , @entity207 appears in his @entity231 jeans and trainers , coffee mug in hand			0
seeing that the morning room where we are talking is occupied , he quietly reverses out the door , like a dog in a @entity240 obedience trial			0
‘ he is very shy , ’ his wife explains			0
no one , least of all the couple themselves , imagined that @entity10 would be so successful			1
now screened in more than 100 countries , it brings @entity99 and @entity249 visitors here in droves			0
‘ who would have thought an @entity254 drama beginning in 1912 would have such huge appeal ? ’ she wonders			0
who indeed , but shooting began this week on the sixth @entity10 series			1
‘ i am sure they would like to go on making more series , ’ she says			0
@entity262 director @entity261 has told her that he wants @entity10 to go on for 18 years			1
‘ that made me gulp			0
’ the money that flows into the @entity27 coffers as a result of the series must surely , however , cushion the blow of domestic disruption			0
after all , before @entity10 hit our screens , the @entity270 admitted that their estate needed £ 11.75 million of repairs , including £ 1.8 million of urgent work on the main house			1
although the family will not say how much money they get for the rental of the castle for filming , @entity207 has since said the show had ‘ taken the pressure off ’ them financially			0
there is also talk of a @entity287 film , which @entity288 does not deny			0
‘ i try not to lie awake at night worrying about money , ’ she says			0
‘ obviously , like everyone else , i have a sense of complete panic every so often			0
i am not in a position where i have so much money i worry about what to do with it			0
’ on sleepless nights , she roams the @entity27 corridors , and likes to sleep in her son ’s bed when he is at boarding school			1
she soothes herself by listening to the @entity303 on @entity304 , feeling grateful that she is not ‘ alone in a boat on the ocean ’			0
@entity23 first met her husband at a dinner party where they bonded over a love of @entity312 poetry			1
her former lover , an eccentric cove called sir @entity315 , had sued her for the return of a pet labrador and claimed she was ‘ the ruthless golddigger of the year ’			0
@entity5 , the @entity6 stately home in @entity7 , provides the ravishing setting for @entity10 it ’s far more likely that the @entity321 were two slightly broken people who made each other complete			1
he had recently separated from his first wife and two young children ; she was grieving over the early death of both her parents			0
they married in february 1999 and had their son @entity329 in october ; a honeymoon baby for a gilded life			1
it is to her credit that she does all her work on @entity27 in the full knowledge that it is her husband ‘ s son , not hers , who will inherit the @entity207 title and all the lands			0
@entity329 gets nothing , but that does not bother her			0
‘ i am not worried			0
if i make some money from books , that is his			0
in life it is not what you take , it is what you give that matters most			1
’ she and @entity184 appear to have a healthy working partnership , one that she describes as ‘ 50/50 with a one per cent swing either way			0
’ they eat breakfast , lunch and dinner together every day and never get tired of each other			0
@entity361 for them is supper on a tray in front of the television			0
her transition from confident and capable young woman to countess is fascinating			0
‘ i would hate to be considered snobbish , ’ she says , although she learned , in the upper class way , to use charm as a weapon to get what she wants			0
‘ you could walk into somewhere like @entity27 and just stand like a petrified creature in the headlights , doing nothing			0
or you could take it one step at a time			0
it is the end , not the journey , that matters			0
’ a journey that sometimes takes in some aggravating neighbours along the way			0
‘ i am a woman , ’ she says , ‘ who knows which battles to fight			0

the @entity23 is the real - life equivalent of @entity10 ’s @entity25
