getting a selfie with a celebrity appears to be the latest craze , but two scuba girls from @entity4 prefer to take their photos with some more colourful creatures			1
divers @entity7 and @entity9 have been snapping exotic underwater life for nearly a decade			1
the recent addition of a selfie stick has helped them get incredible shots next to some of the most dangerous sea creatures in the ocean , such as sharks and sting rays			1
since investing in the fad item , they have been able to mount a @entity72 camera to the end of the pole and obtain incredible lasting memories of their dives , whilst keeping a distance away from the creatures			0
@entity7 said : ' since @entity9 and i were always taking photos and videos of each other , the challenge was often finding a way to get the photographer in the photos too			2
' several years ago we started using @entity72 cameras			0
' with these small cameras we started to find ways to get into the photo even when they were taking the shot - hence the selfie			0
' because we had to stretch out our arm to take the selfie , it was still a challenge getting the surrounding sea life and the photographer in the shot			0
' then one day a company made the selfie stick - and everything changed			2
' pipefish selfie ! before the selfie stick , the co-owners of @entity4 - based diving school @entity64 , seldom took pictures of themselves underwater with the animals as the equipment was n't available with the ability to use a @entity72 camera from an extended vantage point , the diving instructors now take every opportunity they can to take selfies with underwater animals , including eels ( pictured ) now that 's a selfie ! a photograph with a stingray is added to their list in this extraordinary shot the snap happy girls from @entity47 have an impressive dive history , having travelled to @entity37 , the @entity38 and @entity39			1
they mainly have harmless encounters with marine life , but have to be on their guard when around more dangerous creatures like lionfish , sting rays , sharks and eels			2
@entity9 said : ' we have to be very careful and respectful with different sea life			2
' there are some creatures that sting or bite , and some sea life is delicate and can be injured if not treated with caution			0
' having the extendable pole most often allows the animal a comfortable distance from the photographer while being photographed			0
' but yes , it can be an adrenaline rush , no doubt about that			0
' @entity153 selfie ! ' because we had to stretch out our arm to take the selfie , it was still a challenge getting the surrounding sea life and the photographer in the shot ' @entity9 said : ' we have to be very careful and respectful with different sea life			1
there are some creatures that sting or bite , and some sea life is delicate and can be injured if not treated with caution ' the pair from @entity47 mount a @entity72 to the end of their stick to get close to the fish , but remain at a comfortable distance the camera is over here ! the divers aim to first and foremost be respectful to the marine life and not disturb any creatures shark tales ! the divers get a picture perfect shot with a passing shark , which is probably his first selfie !			1

divers @entity7 and @entity9 have been photographing marine life for nearly a decade
