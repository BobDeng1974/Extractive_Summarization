by @entity0 avian flu experiments risk unleashing an accidental global pandemic putting the lives of millions across the world at risk , public health experts have today warned			1
scientists are taking part in controversial tests to create and manipulate strains of bird flu to try and understand how they evolve into more dangerous forms and pass between different species			1
but public health experts at @entity15 and @entity17 universities in the @entity18 have warned the experiments , which aim to track mutation in a bid to better protect against them , pose a risk to the public , if the strains are released accidentally or deliberately			1
the report , published on tuesday , saw experts argue that the dangers of conducting the @entity30 tests far outweigh the benefits			1
a study has claimed experiments into new strains of bird flu pose a risk to public health if the virus is accidentally released , unleashing a global pandemic ( file picture ) @entity15 professor of epidemiology @entity42 and @entity17 professor @entity44 collaborated on the study @entity46 to experiments with @entity48 ' , that appeared in journal @entity49			1
the pair have called for greater scrutiny of such experiments , urging countries across the world to consider an international agreement on the potential risks			0
@entity42 and @entity44 's research state the ' dangers are not just hypothetical ' , citing the theory that the h1n1 influenza strain responsible for ' significant morbidity and mortality around the world from 1977 to 2009 is thought to have originated from a laboratory accident '			0
the report adds : ' there is a quantifiable possibility that these novel pathogens could be accidentally or deliberately released			1
' the study estimates that in the type of containment labs these experiments are carried out in , the number of laboratory - associated infections occur at a rate of two per 1,000 laboratory years in the @entity18 @entity42 and @entity44 say a moderate research programme involving 10 laboratories over a decade would run a 20 per cent risk of at least one instance when an infection is released , risking the threat of it spreading across the world			1
the report said : ' the probability that a laboratory - acquired influenza infection would lead to extensive spread has been estimated to be at least 10 per cent			2
the report , published on tuesday , saw experts argue that the dangers of conducting the @entity30 tests far outweigh the benefits			1
picture shows a strain of avian flu ' simple branching process models suggest a probability of an outbreak arising from an accidental influenza infection in the range of 5 per cent to 60 per cent			2
' the report comes after a @entity18 biosecurity panel ruled in 2012 that two separate studies on mutant bird flu were too dangerous to publish , the @entity104 reported			2
the studies revealed new mutant strains that spread among ferrets - a proxy for humans			0
the panel was concerned the recipe for the influenza strain could fall into the hands of bioterrorists			0
the authors of the research - which was eventually published months later - @entity121 at @entity123 medical centre in @entity124 , and @entity125 at the @entity126 , criticised tuesday 's report			2
they said their work had full ethical , safety and security approval , @entity131 at the @entity104 reports			0
@entity125 said : ' the authors imply that gain - of - function studies are going on without proper reviews			0
' this is not so and suggests they do not understand how highly regulated this work is and the approvals and planning required to conduct this research			0
' this commentary lists many experiments they think we should be doing			0
we are doing many of those experiments already			0

new report was *compiled* by experts at @entity15 and @entity17 universities
warns experiments to create new flu strains and develop more virulent lines pose a risk to public health if released accidentally or deliberately
tests aim to predict mutations to better protect *people* in event of breakout
but authors of new study argue dangers outweigh the benefits
study in 10 labs over a decade would pose 20 *%* risk of infection release
