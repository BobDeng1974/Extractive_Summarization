by @entity1 reporter published : 11:50 est , 7 november 2012 updated : 15:42 est , 7 november 2012 voters in @entity3 , @entity4 and @entity5 legalized gay marriage last night in historic shift on the controversial issue			1
the three referendums , combined with @entity10 voting down a constitutional amendment banning same - sex matrimony , mark the first time supporters of ' traditional marriage ' have ever lost at the polls			1
all 32 previous times the issue has come before the people - weather banning it or legalizing it - voters have chosen to define marriage as between one man and one woman			1
six states allow gay couples to wed , but each of those measures were been enacted either by a court decision or a vote of the state legislature			1
in the weeks leading up to the vote , @entity10 for @entity57 ran a @entity60 photo campaign of @entity62 students , who were photographed with signs that read : ' i 'm voting yes because ... ' with their own personal message			2
similar measures were approved in 30 other states , most recently in @entity68 in may by a wide 61 - to - 39 - percent margin			0
' the tide has turned - when voters have the opportunity to really hear directly from loving , committed same - sex couples and their families , they voted for fairness , ' said @entity77 of the @entity78 , a @entity79 - based gay rights group			2
' those who oppose the freedom to marry for committed couples are clearly on the wrong side of history			0
' backing : @entity10 for @entity57 started a @entity60 campaign featuring @entity62 students showing their support for a state ban on same - sex marriages divisive issue : in the images , students displayed a sign that read ' i 'm voting yes because ... ' with their own personal message the outcomes of the marriage votes could influence the @entity97 @entity96 , which will soon consider whether to take up cases challenging the law that denies federal recognition to same - sex marriages			1
the gay - rights victories come on the heels of numerous national polls that , for the first time , show a majority of @entity97 supporting same - sex marriage			1
@entity3 's referendum marked the first time that gay - rights supporters put same - sex marriage legalization to a popular vote			2
they collected enough signatures to schedule the vote , hoping to reverse a 2009 referendum that quashed a gay - marriage law enacted by the @entity117			2
it passed 53 percent to 47 percent , with 272,000 @entity119 voting against it			0
in @entity4 and @entity5 , gay - marriage laws were approved by lawmakers and signed by the governors this year , but opponents gathered enough signatures to challenge the laws			2
emotion : three young men sobbed in @entity128 , @entity10 , sobbed with happiness when they learned that a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage had failed celebration : gay marriage supporters in @entity5 turned out to cheer as a referendum legalizing the practice passed @entity4 gov @entity136 , who campaigned vigorously for the marriage measure , spoke to a jubilant crowd in @entity139			1
those ballot proposals each passed by a 52 - to - 48 - percent margin			0
@entity142 , 31 , danced with his partner of four years after the result in @entity4 became clear			0
he said they would like to marry now that it 's legal in @entity4			0
' it feels so good to be accepted by so many people of all different backgrounds , ' he said			0
' it just feels wonderful			0
' in @entity10 , gay marriage remains illegal , but an act of the state legislature could overturn the law			1
had it become a constitutional amendment , it would have been more difficult for gay rights advocates to undo the measure			1
the vote was 51 percent against the ban and 48 for it			0
the president of the most active advocacy group opposing same - sex marriage , @entity166 of the @entity167 , insisted tuesday 's results did not mark a watershed moment			2
' at the end of the day , we 're still at 32 victories , ' he said			0
' just because two extreme blue states vote for gay marriage does n't mean the @entity96 will create a constitutional right for it out of thin air			1
' he made his remarks before the outcome of @entity5 's referendum became clear .			0

@entity10 voters reject constitutional amendment banning gay marriage
outcomes mark a *sea* change in the way @entity97 voters view the issue
six states that have previously legalized gay marriage have done it through legislature or by court order
