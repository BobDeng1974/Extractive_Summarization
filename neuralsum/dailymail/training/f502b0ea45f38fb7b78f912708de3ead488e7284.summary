by @entity0 follow @ @ martinkeown5 some people think @entity2 are mad to bring @entity3 to @entity4 , but he is the kind of signing that gets fans buzzing with excitement			1
he is a unique character but he can galvanise the club and has the potential to be a real success at @entity2			1
he looks to pull off the shoulder and get in behind defenders , and he did just that when he drifted off the back of @entity31 to head in for @entity32 at the far post			0
handful : striker @entity3 is strong in the air and good with both feet striking mentality we all know about his problems off the field but he ca n’t let them affect his game on it			1
if he keeps his focus he is deadly			0
he is cool in front of goal — he has scored 17 out of 19 penalties for club and country — but he is susceptible to being wound up			1
in @entity50 at @entity2 have the perfect coach to get the best out of him			1
sometimes it does n’t matter if your team - mate is wearing crazy clothes or setting off fireworks in his bathroom — as long as he does the business on the pitch you put up with it			0
relaxed : @entity3 gets to grips with fellow @entity63 @entity62 during a training session on friday deadly technique often @entity3 relies on raw power to beat his man but he still has excellent technique			2
he is strong in the air and good with both feet , particularly his right			0
if he can get in behind defenders in that right - hand channel then more often than not the ball will end up in the back of the net threat : @entity3 scores against @entity22 at this summer 's @entity24 time for some team - work @entity3 is not an out - and - out striker , but he never wants to wander too far from that central area where he can score			1
he may have to adapt at @entity2			2
@entity81 was forever popping up all over the pitch and , though @entity3 is not a direct replacement , he has to be prepared to rotate			2
hard to handle : defenders have to stand up to the physical challenge with @entity86 pure power @entity22 failed to get a grip on @entity3 and a large part of that was because of his raw power			2
he is so strong and , combined with his pace , it makes him a fearsome striker			0
i might be a bit ‘ clumsy ’ around him to see how he reacts , because he can be wound up			0
it ’s not clever to get too tight when marking him unless you ’re favourite to win the ball .			0
