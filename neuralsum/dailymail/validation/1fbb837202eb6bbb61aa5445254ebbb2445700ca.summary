@entity0 reacted angrily to a @entity3 minister 's warning against banning hate preachers @entity0 reacted with fury after a @entity3 minister warned against banning radical preachers from universities during a fiery @entity10 meeting , it has been revealed			1
the prime minister ' jumped on ' the universities minister @entity14 after he spoke out against @entity15 plans to force universities to ban non-violent ' extremists ' , sources said			1
mr @entity0 was backed up by the home secretary @entity18 and communities secretary @entity19			1
the extraordinary row comes after it emerged mrs may is at loggerheads with the @entity24 dem business secretary @entity23 over the issue			1
the @entity15 wants all campuses to become no - go zones for all ' extremist ' speakers to prevent students becoming radicalised			1
but mr @entity23 insists that the move could force debates ' underground ' , where extreme views will go unchallenged			1
last month 's @entity10 row suggests the issue is dividing the @entity3 as well as the @entity37			1
the issue has come to the fore after the unmasking of @entity41 – a @entity43 graduate thought to be the @entity45 executioner known as @entity46			1
@entity48 was named in a 2009 report as having invited three hate preachers to give a talk in 2006 , and just days before @entity41 's identity was revealed , thousands signed a petition to block an event where an anti-gay figure was due to speak			1
former students at the university have claimed it is a ' hotbed of radicalism ' where students ' celebrated 9/11 '			2
@entity48 pupil @entity61 , who campaigns against extremism at @entity64 universities , said the conditions at the university are right for the radicalisation of someone like @entity41			2
new laws passed by the government put a legal requirement on universities to prevent terrorism			2
mrs may insists this should include barring people with extreme views from speaking on campus			0
but mr @entity23 , who is responsible for university policy , warns a blanket ban on radical preachers could backfire			1
' if the default option is to ban outright , there is a chance the debate will happen anyway outside the campus in an uncontrolled ' underground ' environment , with no challenge to extreme views at all			0
' but mrs may said : ' if colleges and universities did n't realise before what we are up against , they should know now			2
we 're not talking about regulating legitimate debate — we 're saying they need to do more to stop radicalisation on campus			0
' since news of @entity121 's connection with @entity45 in @entity122 broke , the @entity43 's @entity118 has distanced itself from having any involvement			0
@entity41 - the @entity124 militant known as ' @entity46 ' - studied at the @entity43 @entity3 party chairman @entity126 mr @entity125 accused the @entity127 of blocking attempts to crack down on radicalisation			2
he said : ' yes there is a difference of opinion			0
@entity23 does n't want to do what @entity3 want to do which is that on campus we do n't want radical preachers saying things which incite violence which ultimately can lead to the radicalisation of young people			1
' we have seen these three girls go off to @entity122 , we have seen @entity46 , we do n't want think that sort of preaching should happen in our universities			2
' i 'm afraid to say that conservatives just have a simple view that people in @entity23 's constituency of @entity150 or around the country deserve that protection and that means we have to put proper , decent , tough rules in place which do n't ban free speech but do stop people from preaching death			1
' the @entity43 has hit back at claims it is a fertile breeding ground for @entity118 fundamentalism as arguments rage over who is to blame over @entity46			0
@entity164 - born @entity163 had been pinpointed as a potential terrorist by the @entity64 authorities but was nonetheless able to travel to @entity122 in 2013 and join a group responsible for the murder of several @entity170 hostages			0
responding to claims from a fellow former student that the university allowed extremism , a spokesman for the institution said : ' we condemn the promotion of radicalisation , terrorism and violence or threats against any member of our community			0
' we have strict policies to promote tolerance among our 20,000 student community , who come to study from over 150 nations			0
' there was also a renewed suggestion - from a former independent reviewer of government anti-terror laws - that @entity41 might have been prevented from joining up with @entity118 had restrictions on suspects not been relaxed			0
' had control orders been in place , in my view there is a realistic prospect that @entity41 , and at least two of his associates , would have been the subject of control orders with a compulsory relocation , ' @entity196 said			0
' if that had been the case , he would not have done what he 's done in recent times , ' the @entity127 peer added .			0
