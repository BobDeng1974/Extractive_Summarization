@entity0 : @entity1 with his grandmother he has always described himself as boring – and his diet is clearly no exception			1
@entity1 has revealed that during @entity5 he survives on a rotation of three simple evening meals and smoothies and mushed banana on bagel for breakfast			1
all the dishes are prepared by his long - term girlfriend , @entity13 , at their £ 5m home in @entity15 , @entity16 , where she is also said to the laundry and grocery shopping at @entity20			2
writing on is @entity22 blog , @entity1 explained : ‘ you might not be surprised to hear that i do n’t order a pizza when i get in			1
my dinner options are kept simple during @entity5			0
‘ i have either salmon with rice , roast chicken with vegetables and potatoes , or steak with salad			1
my girlfriend @entity13 will cook and i know each night that it will be one of those three			2
‘ i had salmon on tuesday night , so i knew that on wednesday it would be one of the other two			1
‘ my guess was steak			2
’ luckily , @entity1 said he can be a little more ‘ creative ’ with breakfast			1
he said : ‘ i usually have a smoothie , and on tuesday morning it involved strawberry yoghurt , raspberries , apple juice - a bunch of stuff - and then i had an apple and a peach			2
‘ i also had a bagel with banana			0
i ’ve been asked a lot of questions about all sorts of things during my career , and i think i ’ve said somewhere in the past that i do n’t like bananas			0
‘ well , i can update you - if i mush it up and put it on a bagel , it ’s fine ! i guess it must be the consistency			0
’ @entity1 said on the nights before a match he drinks a litre of a sports drink to ‘ pre-hydrate ’ and after matches he usually has a protein shake			1
he added : ‘ it is supposed to be chocolate but , to be honest , it does n’t taste great ! ’ in the past @entity1 ’s diet has been a little more interesting			1
simply pour the ingredients into a blender and whizz			0
one pot of strawberry yoghurt one packet of raspberries half a glass of apple juice juice of two oranges handful of blueberries last year it included up to 50 portions of sushi in one sitting to build up his imposing 6ft 3in , 13½ stone frame			1
at @entity5 he has been known to put sushi in an ice cooler so he can have it brought to him at the end of a late game			0
and his grandmother said this week that to she had sent down some of her home made shortbread for him to eat after matches			0
while at home this week , @entity1 said he had been enjoying watching the @entity108 during the but finds the 11 o’clock kick offs for some of the matches too late for him			1
asked by a fan on @entity113 in april to describe himself in one word , @entity1 replied ‘ boring			2
’ but @entity1 ’s mother , @entity115 , said this his son benefitted from a simple domestic life during @entity5			2
she said : ‘ he certainly seems to be very relaxed			0
he can stay at home during @entity5 and he has his girlfriend and his dogs there			0
‘ he can go back to his house and his own bed			0
the dogs are a great distraction for him			0

instead of a turbo - *charged* diet @entity1 eats salmon , chicken or steak
but he does have a litre of sports drink to ' pre-hydrate ' the night before
in the past the 6ft 3in star has eaten up to 50 sushi portions in one sitting
