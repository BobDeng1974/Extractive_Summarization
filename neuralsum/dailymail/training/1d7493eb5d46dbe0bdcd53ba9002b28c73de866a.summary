@entity1 winner @entity0 has told @entity2 he is the perfect man to develop the next generation of @entity2 starlets			1
the former @entity5 and @entity7 midfielder has applied for the @entity10 manager 's job and is hoping that the wisdom garnered from a glittering career will work in his favour when the @entity2 directors make their decision			1
applications for the vacancy created when @entity18 left for @entity19 close on wednesday and @entity20 understands the @entity2 board are keen to have a new manager in place by the middle of next week			1
caretaker @entity25 will remain in charge for wednesday 's clash at @entity29 and saturday 's home fixture with @entity31			1
former @entity7 midfielder @entity0 has applied for the vacant managers 's job at @entity2 ' i know a lot about @entity2 , ' said the @entity36			1
' they have a great academy there and have already produced so many good young players			0
' with the experience i have gained during my playing career , i can teach them a lot			0
i like working with young players			0
' another @entity46 connection for @entity0 is that his wife , @entity47 , is @entity48 but his reasons for wanting to return to the dear green place are , he insists , purely professional			1
' i will not be coming to @entity46 for a holiday , ' he said			0
' i will work as hard as i possibly can to be successful			0
' i think my style is perfectly suited to the way the game is played in the @entity55			2
i like aggressive football and for players to put pressure on the ball			0
@entity0 was signed for @entity5 by @entity60 in 1997 , but was moved on 15 months later ' my agent has already spoken to the people from @entity2 and i have told him to put everything on hold until we have a response from them			1
' there have been clubs from @entity70 , @entity71 and other countries who have contacted us to offer me jobs but @entity2 is at the top of my list and i will not speak to anyone else for the next few weeks			1
' i have family in @entity46 but that is not the only reason i want to work there			0
the football is a good standard and there is a good atmosphere at the matches			0
' @entity2 are also a nice club to go to			1
their results this season have been impressive – especially beating @entity91 at @entity92 – and they are in the top half of the table			2
' their previous manager has just been chosen by @entity19 and he is younger than me so that proves it is a good job ! ' the tigerish midfielder is , of course , no stranger to the @entity46 game			2
signed for @entity5 by @entity60 in 1997 , @entity102 sold him to @entity103 for £ 4million just 15 months later , setting in motion a career which saw him lift the @entity106 twice with @entity7			1
caretaker @entity25 will remain in charge of @entity2 for wednesday 's clash at @entity29 but @entity0 , who won the 2006 @entity1 with @entity110 , has n't enjoyed the best of luck in his initial attempts at management			1
he lasted just three months in his first two jobs , as player / coach of @entity118 side @entity117 in 2012 and as manager of @entity121 club @entity120 the following year			2
he then spent six months with @entity123 side @entity122 before finally throwing in the towel just three weeks ago			0
@entity125 , meanwhile , has still not officially applied for @entity18 's job but would welcome discussions with @entity128 and his board			1
should he ultimately be overlooked by the @entity2 , however , @entity25 insists he would happily work under @entity36 @entity1 winner @entity0 or whomever lands the post			1
at 33 , he feels time is on his side to finish his career as a defender before one day eventually fulfilling his dream of taking charge of a team			2
' if someone else comes in as manager i 'll be fine going back as a player , ' said @entity25 , who has his b - licence and has coached the @entity145 since 2012			1
' i always knew that could be the case			0
i 'd like to continue playing and there will be no hard feelings on my part if another man is in charge			2
applications for the vacancy created when @entity18 ( above ) left for @entity19 close on wednesday ' but management is something that interests me			2
i feel i have a decent knowledge in football and it 's something i see myself doing , if not now then certainly in the future			2
' i 've not applied but the chairman and board will decide what way they want to go			0
and if they want to come and speak to me then that 's great but until that happens i will continue to do what i 'm doing and look to try and win games			0
' the most important thing for me is the next game and right now that 's @entity29 on wednesday night			1
' @entity25 believes the success of @entity18 , who stepped up from captain to replace manager @entity173 , shows that promoting from within can be the right move			1
and should he get the job , he jokes he has already planned his first major signing			0
' my playing contract is up in the summer and i have n't spoken to the club about that yet , ' he smiled			0
' but i still think i 've got something to offer on the pitch			0
i feel good physically and experience-wise i think i can be a help to the younger players round about me			0
so if i get the job maybe i can give myself a five - year deal ! ' i 'm best mates with @entity18 and it shows how you can progress from player to manager and be a success			2
' a few clubs have gone that way recently in terms of promoting players from within the squad and it 's certainly been successful at @entity2			1
' but you just do n't know what 's going to happen			0
until i do , i 've got a lot more to think and worry about in terms of preparing the team than worrying about things i ca n't influence			0

@entity0 has applied for the vacant @entity2 manager 's job
