and he plans to bring back that option for criminals sentenced to death in his state			2
rep. @entity14 , a @entity15 from the northern @entity2 city of @entity17 , plans to introduce his proposal during @entity2 's next legislative session in january			2

in the wake of a bungled execution in @entity5 last month , a @entity2 lawmaker wants to resurrect firing squads as a method of execution in his state what a choice ! following last month 's botched execution in @entity5 , a @entity2 lawmaker is proposing a ' humane ' policy throwback : give death row inmates the option of being executed by firing squad @entity2 already has a tradition of execution by firing squad , with five police officers using .30 - caliber @entity47 rifles to execute @entity48 in 2010 , the last execution by rifle to be held in the state			1
@entity14 argues the controversial method may seem more palatable now , especially as states struggle to maneuver lawsuits and drug shortages that have complicated lethal injections			0
' it sounds like the @entity58 , but it 's probably the most humane way to kill somebody , ' @entity14 said			0
@entity2 eliminated execution by firing squad in 2004 , citing the excessive media attention it gave inmates			1
opinionated : rep. @entity14 , a @entity15 from @entity17 , says firing squads would be a quick and humane way to put someone to death as lawsuits and drug shortages have hampered lethal injections in recent years			2
@entity14 plans to introduce his proposal during @entity71 next legislative session in january no change : the botched execution of @entity5 inmate @entity75 has n't dampened public enthusiasm for execution but those sentenced to death before that date still had the option of choosing it , which is how @entity48 ended up standing in front of five armed @entity2 police officers			1
@entity48 was sentenced to death for fatally shooting a @entity86 attorney in 1985 while trying to escape from a courthouse			2
he was third person to die by firing squad after the @entity90 @entity89 reinstated the death penalty in 1976			1
a couple other death row inmates have opted to die by gunfire instead of lethal injection in @entity2 , but they are all several years away from exhausting the appeals of their death sentences , assistant utah attorney general @entity92 said			1
@entity14 's proposal would give all inmates the option			0
lethal injection , the default method of execution in the @entity90 , has received heightened scrutiny after secrecy and drug shortages in recent years and the april incident in @entity5 , when inmate @entity75 's vein collapsed and he died of a heart attack more than 40 minutes later			1
@entity14 and lawmakers in other states have suggested firing squads might be the cheapest and most humane method			0
' the prisoner dies instantly , ' @entity14 said			0
it sounds really bad , but the minute the bullet hits your heart , you 're dead			0
' execution chamber : @entity2 stopped allowing death - row inmates to choose execution by firing squad after 2004			1
@entity2 last used the method in 2010 , when a firing squad of five police officers with .30 - caliber @entity47 rifles executed @entity48 the results of @entity134 's poll of 800 @entity90 reveals : opponents of the proposal say firing squads are not necessarily a fool - proof answer			1
it 's possible an inmate could move or shooters could miss , causing the inmate a slow and painful death , said @entity144 , executive director of the @entity146 , - based @entity145 , which opposes capital punishment			2
' the idea is that it would be very quick and accurate but just a little movement by the person could change that , ' he said			0
' things can go wrong with any method of execution			0
' he cited a case from @entity2 's territorial days in 1897 , when a firing squad missed @entity159 's heart and it took him 27 minutes to die , according to newspaper accounts of the execution			1
@entity144 said that if @entity2 brought back firing squads as a default option rather than leaving it up to inmates to choose , as was the practice before 2004 , it could be challenged in court			2
the @entity90 @entity89 upheld the use of the firing squad in 1879 , but as tastes have changed in the country since then , @entity144 said it 's possible a modern court could rule the practice violates an inmate 's protection from cruel and unusual punishment			1
beyond the legal challenges , @entity144 said it will probably bring back the kind of ' voyeuristic attention ' the state wanted to avoid			0
for @entity14 , the option makes sense to avoid a situation like @entity5 or legal fights over the blend of drugs used in lethal injections			2
' there 's no easy way to put somebody to death , but you need to be efficient and effective about it , ' @entity14 said			0
' this is certainly one way to do that			0
