published : 13:03 est , 3 april 2013 updated : 13:37 est , 3 april 2013 @entity1 has hit major delays with its flagship @entity4 software due to a radical new look and feel , it was claimed today			1
experts say engineers have had to be pulled from its @entity10 software group so the new version can be finished in time for a rumoured summer launch			0
it will be the first major overhaul of its software under @entity17 designer sir @entity16 , and is believed to look completely different with a cleaner , uncluttered design			1
@entity1 's sir @entity16 in may 2012			1
he is now overseeing a major overhaul of the firm 's @entity4 software , which is believed to have hit delays			2
sir @entity16 was given the responsibility the software earlier this year after the company fired @entity27 in a move believed to be related to the firm 's huge problems with its @entity32 app. ' what i 've heard : @entity35 is running behind , and engineers have been pulled from @entity37 to work on it ' said @entity39 of the @entity1 blog @entity41			1
he also claimed engineers working on the project had been given special handsets			0
' @entity45 is that @entity35 engineers with carry privileges all have some sort of polarizing filter on their @entity51 displays , such that it greatly decreases viewing angles , thus making it difficult for observers to see the apparently rather significant system - wide @entity57 overhaul			0
' @entity1 's next @entity51 could go on sale in the summer alongside the new software , it has been claimed			1
sources close to the electronics giant say the handset , expected to be a speed - boosted version of the current @entity51 with new software , will begin production within weeks and go on sale in the summer			2
this will break with @entity1 's traditional autumn unveiling of a new handset , and is likely to pave the way for a lower cost iphone to be revealed later in the year			1
customers queue up to purchase the @entity51 smartphone at the @entity1 flagship store on @entity77 in @entity78 , @entity79			2
the firm is believed to be preparing to unveil the next version in the summer			0
@entity1 's next two @entity83 had already been designed before @entity84 died in october 2011 , it has been claimed			1
at a meeting with the @entity88 district attorney , @entity87 , who is keen to cut phone thefts in the region , @entity1 's liaison officer @entity85 is reported by the @entity91 to have said the designs for the next two phones ' preceded @entity94 [ being chief executive ] '			1
the new model is believed to look identical to the current @entity51 but include a faster processor and updated camera , according to online reports			2
' @entity1 plans to begin production of a refreshed @entity51 similar in size and shape to its current one in the second quarter of the year , according to people familiar with the device 's production , teeing up a possible summer launch for the next version of its flagship device , ' claims the @entity110			1
' at the same time , @entity1 continues to work with its manufacturing partners in @entity112 on a less expensive @entity51 that could be launched as soon as the second half of this year , these people said			1
' the report is in line with the expectations of company watchers and @entity119 analysts			0
the @entity51 costs around $ 600 in the @entity121 , and while @entity1 maintains older iphones in production , even those are n't cheap enough to compete effectively against low - end smartphones running @entity127 's @entity126 software			1
@entity1 does not comment on future products before its launch events			2
earlier this year it was claimed the @entity130 will be revealed in april and go on sale in august			0
it also claims that new @entity133 models are set to be announced in april , including a new version of the firm 's hugely successful @entity135 with an upgraded screen			0
already obsolete ? two models display the @entity51 during the product 's release at a store in @entity142 on december 14			0
an analyst has claimed production of the next @entity51 will begin in march for a summer launch ' @entity147 has learned that @entity1 is planning the release of the @entity130 for this summer , currently for august , ' the site said			2
' next generation @entity133 , presumably the @entity133 5 and potentially the ipad mini 2 , may also debut as soon as this april , ' it added			0
sir @entity16 , who was born in @entity151 , north - east @entity152 , is one of @entity1 's most high - profile executives and is widely credited with the unique , groundbreaking designs for the @entity155 , @entity51 , and @entity133			1
the 46 - year - old , who was born in @entity151 , north @entity152 , studied design at the @entity158 and joined @entity1 in 1992 , where he has been based in @entity159 ever since.in 2003 he was named @entity160 by the @entity161 in @entity152 and was given the title @entity163 by the @entity164 of @entity165 has also won the prestigious @entity166 in the @entity16 , who has been described as a perfectionist , first worked on the @entity168 , an all - in - one personal computer where all the physical components and screen were packaged @entity171 then led a design team in creating the @entity155 , @entity51 , @entity133 and a number of other well - known products that are regarded as having turned around the firm 's fortunes , transforming it from a bit - player in the computer industry to the world 's biggest tech company			1
' if these plans stick , we should be in for a fun spring and summer			0
' it comes as @entity186 @entity1 blog @entity184 reported that @entity187 is starting to ramp up production of @entity1 's @entity51 successor , according to @entity190			1
it claims that because the design of the ' @entity130 ' is substantially the same as the company 's existing handset , little to no tooling is needed to manufacture the two models on the same production lines			0
leaked photo ? this image purports to show the case of the new @entity130			0
published by @entity205 website @entity203 , the differences in internal attachment points suggest an update to the latest @entity1 phone the claims echo those made by @entity210 of investment bank @entity211 earlier this year , who said @entity1 will begin making a new @entity51 model in march for an expected launch in june or july			1
mr @entity210 predicted that @entity51 sales could begin to drop as customers anticipate the arrival of the next model , but he nonetheless said he expects around 44 million to ship in the quarter to march			0
' as word of the earlier production schedule starts to spread , we believe we could see a slight slowing of demand @entity224 in anticipation of the new product launch and @entity1 will likely start curtailing channel inventory , ' he was quoted as saying by @entity229			0
' therefore we tweak down our @entity231 shipment estimate from @entity232 to @entity233 , which is still well above widespread fears of shipments in the mid- @entity236			0
' the analyst 's prediction of a summer launch date for the @entity130 is a reiteration of claims he made last month , when he said he expects the new phone to ship in various colours and with improved battery life			0
on rumours of an entry - level @entity51 , mr @entity210 claimed @entity1 could release a low - cost device made of polycarbonate with no @entity249 ( @entity251 ) capability			2
the speculation seemed to contradict comments made by @entity254 , @entity1 's marketing chief , who recently told @entity256 newspaper the @entity257 that ' despite the popularity of cheap smartphones , this well never be the future of @entity1 's products			2

@entity4 7 expected to have an entirely new ' clean ' look and feel
will be first version overseen by @entity1 's sir @entity16
expected to launch alongside an updated @entity51 later this year
