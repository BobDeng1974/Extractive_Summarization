researchers have discovered red wood ants prefer to build their colonies along active faults , fractures where the @entity10 ruptures , in @entity11			1
@entity12 , of the @entity13 , in @entity11 , said the behaviour of the ants significantly changed before an earthquake above magnitude 2.0 hit the area			1
their behaviour did not return to normal until a day after the earthquake			2
sense : red wood ants ( pictured ) significantly change their behaviour before an earthquake , researchers have discovered colony : the researchers tracked the ants round the clock for three years between 2009 and 2012 @entity12 presented her research at the @entity33 annual meeting , in @entity34 , @entity30 has reported			1
her team , who counted 15,000 ant mounds lining the active faults , tracked the ants round the clock for three years between 2009 and 2012			2
the team discovered the ants would undergo their usual activities during the day before retreating into their mound at night			0
but before an earthquake , the ants would stay awake and remained outside the mound during the night , leaving them vulnerable to predators			0
the research suggested the ants only changed their behaviour when the earthquake was over magnitude 2 , which is the smallest earthquakes humans can feel			0
@entity12 has suggested the insects are able to predict the earthquakes by picking up changing gas emissions or shifts in the @entity10 's magnetic field			1
communication : red wood ants , pictured here communicating by touching antennae , prefer to build their colonies along active faults , the team found damage : buildings damaged by an earthquake in @entity68 , near @entity69 , in may last year @entity12 said : ' red wood ants have chemo receptors for carbon dioxide gradients and magneto receptors for electromagnetic fields			1
' we 're not sure why or how they react to the possible stimuli , but we 're planning on going to a more tectonically active region and see if ants react to larger earthquakes			0
' the @entity81 has reported @entity12 and her colleagues are hoping to continue their research in areas where larger earthquakes are more common .			0

ants in @entity11 prefer to build their colonies along active faults
researchers discover their behaviour significantly alters before earthquake
behaviour only returns to normal a day after the earthquake
ants may pick up changing gas emissions or shifts in @entity10 's magnetic field
