@entity2 ’s @entity1 diving team , led by @entity3 , arrive in @entity4 on thursday after a mid-air plane drama in which they felt certain they were about to die			1
the eight divers , who also comprise @entity9 ’s ‘ a team ’ of talent at @entity12 level , were left shaking and tearful after a flight from @entity14 to @entity15 had to make an emergency diversion which ended with a plunging , shuddering landing in @entity18			1
the incident happened on monday , as the world remained in shock about the appalling loss of life in the @entity25 tragedy last week over @entity26			1
‘ i thought we were going to die , ’ said @entity27 , a 21 - year - old springboard specialist , who is one of the athletes @entity44 is following on the @entity45			2
‘ it was scary beyond belief			2
’ speaking exclusively to @entity44 , @entity27 was the first of the divers to describe in detail how the incident unfolded			1
he was travelling with seven other divers — @entity3 , @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 and @entity60 and eight gb support staff on the way back from a @entity63 event in @entity64			2
the party also included @entity3 ’s boyfriend @entity66 , aboard an aircraft carrying 301 people in total			2
the plane took off on monday morning , @entity14 time and it became apparent after around three hours into the trip that something was badly wrong			1
on board : @entity75 ( left ) and @entity60 were also on the plane @entity78 ready for 2014 @entity77 ‘ people around me were sleeping but i wanted to stay awake to try to get my body clock right for landing back in the @entity34 , ’ @entity27 said			2
‘ i was watching movies , and keeping an eye on the flight time to destination ( clock )			1
‘ and then suddenly it dropped from around eight hours remaining to an hour and 10 minutes , within a few seconds			1
‘ i knew something was n’t right , and within a few moments an alarm went off , like a blaring klaxon , and then there was an announcement that there was a mechanical fault and we would need to land in @entity95			1
’ @entity27 was near the back of the plane , with his synchro partner @entity55 on one side and @entity75 on the other			2
@entity60 , distraught and panicking , was nearby			2
@entity3 , equally concerned , was seated a few rows back			2
the time to destination clock then changed again , falling within a few minutes from 50 minutes left to 30 minutes and then 14 minutes			0
in action : @entity3 was competing in the @entity63 before heading to the @entity1 ‘ they ’d seen that we were n’t going to reach @entity95 , ’ @entity27 said			1
‘ we were obviously going to come down wherever we could			0
‘ one of our team overheard a staff member on the plane suggesting that the pilot might have to land on water			1
there was no confirmation of this , no announcement , but there was a lake ahead			0
’ the pilot began dumping all the fuel stored in the wings			0
some passengers mistook the hazy dispersal to be smoke and began to fear the plane could be on fire			1
‘ only a handful of us heard what we thought was a reference to landing on water , ’ @entity27 said			1
‘ @entity60 was so upset			0
@entity55 and i were trying to keep it together , almost laughing , although it was hysterical			0
what was going through my head was “ the whole of @entity136 is going to die here ”			0
’ the plane descended rapidly , although under control			0
@entity27 assumed the pilot needed to get to the ground as quickly as possible to reach the runway at the small airport where they touched down , as opposed to ditching on water			1
‘ when we hit the ground , the braking was about 10 times more sudden than usual , maybe because we did n’t have a lot of runway left , ’ he said			0
more to come : @entity3 is looking to add to his @entity12 bronze medal the plane landed at a small airport near @entity154 in @entity18			0
there was a wait of around an hour as the craft was surrounded by fire engines before all the passengers disembarked , safe but shaken			1
‘ @entity3 was beside himself , ’ @entity27 said			0
‘ it was so scary for everyone			0
we thought that was it			0
’ the passengers spent monday night in a hotel in @entity18 while @entity39 sent another plane to bring them back to @entity9			1
they arrived back on tuesday and spent thursday in @entity15 , preparing for their trip to @entity169 by train			1
‘ what happened to us was insignificant compared to the awful events on flight @entity174 , ’ @entity27 said			2
‘ of course all our thoughts are with those victims and their families			0
‘ we also have nothing but thanks for @entity39 , who got us safely on the ground , and then home			0
‘ something like this definitely puts things in perspective for all of us			0
‘ we ’re just glad to be here , and grateful to be in a position to take part in a sports event			0
