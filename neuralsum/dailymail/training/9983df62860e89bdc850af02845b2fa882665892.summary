by @entity0 nearly a quarter of young @entity4 men are now obese and the impact on their health is similar to premature ageing , new research has revealed			1
a team at @entity11 's @entity10 studied 2,500 men and women aged 20 to 96 , using whole body scans to accurately assess fat and obesity levels			1
they concluded that 24 per cent of young men in the 20 to 29 age group were obese - a significant rise on the previous estimate which was just eight per cent			1
researchers say that the huge discrepancy is due to problems with the @entity24 ( @entity24 ) , which does not distinguish between different body shapes			1
crisis : around 24 per cent of @entity4 men aged 20 to 29 are now overweight , new research has revealed professor @entity28 , deputy director of the @entity10 and @entity29 of the @entity30 for @entity31 , said that the problem was particularly acute when assessing men			1
' while we found @entity24 - based estimates for obesity in most women were fairly accurate , the use of the @entity24 markedly underestimated the amount of body fat in young men aged 20 - 29 , ' she said			1
' the fat to weight ratio appears to be disproportionately high in this group , which means many young men are carrying more fat , proportional to their weight , than expected			1
' global and @entity4 estimates of obesity have been based on @entity24			2
yet , as a measure of body weight for height , this technique does n't account for different body types			0
' it does n't distinguish between fat , muscle or bone , which contribute to body weight differently for men and women , and for different age groups			0
' professor @entity62 blamed an active lifestyle and poor diet for the trend and added that the effect on the body left younger men prone to problems that usually come with age			2
' it means that an alarming number of young men are exhibiting the physical characteristics of older men , where muscle mass has been replaced by fat , ' she said			2
' this has particular implications for muscle weakness and potential osteoporosis later in life			0
' the number of people who are obese worldwide has nearly doubled over the last 30 years , with women bearing the brunt of the trend			0
approximately one in three women and one in five men are obese - and an estimated two thirds of the adult population are either overweight or obese			2
@entity24 has been the medical standard of measuring weight for many years			0
however , research over the last few years - including the latest study - indicates that it is not the most accurate of assessments			0
' we knew that the @entity24 overestimates obesity in muscular body builds and underestimates obesity in the elderly , but the underestimation of obesity in young men is a new finding ' , professor @entity62 said			1
' we have an obesity epidemic on our hands			0
we need the most accurate information possible so that we can address this issue and encourage people to improve their diet and lifestyle			0

24 per cent of @entity4 men aged 20 to 29 are now *classed* as obese
@entity121 is a huge jump from the previous estimate of eight per cent
researchers at @entity11 said discrepancy due to issues with @entity24
obese young men experience health problems similar to premature ageing
