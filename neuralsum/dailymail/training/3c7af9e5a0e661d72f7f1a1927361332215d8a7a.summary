by @entity0 published : 08:26 est , 21 june 2013 updated : 06:03 est , 22 june 2013 a seven - month - old boy is suffering with a large growth that resembles a tail and it is growing longer every week			2
the growth developed a result of the boy , named @entity9 , being born with spina bifida			1
his mother @entity12 , from @entity13 in @entity14 , said she has asked for the growth to be removed but surgeons say it is n't possible , at least at the moment			2
seven - month - old @entity9 was born with spina bifida , a condition that causes the spine to become deformed			1
it is this that has caused the unusual growth at the bottom of his spinal column she said : ' we have asked the surgeons to remove the tail but they tell us it is not that simple			2
' @entity33 or ' split spine ' is a fault in the development of the spine and spinal cord which leaves a gap in the spine			2
the spinal cord is responsible for connecting all parts of the body to the brain			0
in the first month of life , a developing baby in the womb grows a structure called the neural tube			0
it is this that will eventually form the spine and nervous system			0
but in cases of spina bifida , the spinal column - the bone that surrounds and protects the nerves - does not fully close			1
the exact causes are unknown , but several risk factors have been identified , the most significant being a lack of folic acid before and at the very start of pregnancy			0
there are a number of different types of spina bifida but @entity9 has myelomeningocele , the most serious variant of the condition			1
it affects one pregnancy in every 1,000 in @entity73			0
surgeon @entity74 says that if they operate now the 10 cm long ' tail ' it will return unless they repair the spinal canal first @entity33 or ' split spine ' is a fault in the development of the spinal cord which leaves a gap in the spine			1
in @entity9 's case the spinal membranes and cord have pushed out to create a sac in the baby ¿ s back			1
@entity91 causes the spinal column to remain open along the bones making up the spine			0
the membranes and spinal cord push out to create a sac in the baby ’s back			1
this sometimes leaves the nervous system vulnerable to infections that may be fatal			0
in most cases surgery can be can close the defect but damage to the nervous system will usually already have taken place , resulting in a range of symptoms , including paralysis and incontinence			0
@entity112 medics say the growth at the base of @entity9 's spine has been caused by damage to the outer wall of the child 's spinal canal			1
surgeon @entity74 explained : ' @entity9 's growth is quite well developed and now measures some 10 centimetres			1
' ' if we cut it off it will simply grow again			0
we need to repair the spinal canal first to stop it reoccurring			0

@entity9 , from @entity14 , was born with spina bifida - a condition that stops the spine developing normally and causes it to split
@entity9 has myelomeningocele spina bifida which causes the spinal membranes and cord to push out of spine and create a sac in the back
the ' tail ' continues to grow but surgeons say they can not remove growth until they repair @entity9 's spine
