obesity and diabetes could be prevented by switching off a receptor in the brain which causes overeating and food cravings			1
researchers have blocked the effects of the nuclear receptor @entity9 in a small number of brain cells in mice , causing them to eat less and become resistant to a high fat diet			1
it is hoped that the same results may one day be possible in humans to prevent weight gain			0
obesity could be prevented by switching off a receptor in the brain , which causes overeating and food cravings , scientists say trendy diets are leaving millions of @entity23 with stomach aches and other digestive problems , according to new research			2
just under half of all adults suffer some pain when they try and lose weight and 55 per cent of people aged 25 - 34 – who are most likely to try ‘ faddy ’ diets - are in discomfort			2
a report by @entity37 's @entity36 said that the age group was most likely to try regimes such as @entity40 and @entity41			0
in a survey of 2,000 adults , it found that half are on a diet			0
those suffering stomach ache are likely to give up their quest to lose weight and pile on the pounds			0
health expert dr @entity51 said : " it is so important to be aware our digestive health can affect our weight , with so many of us apparently unable to maintain our weight at a healthy level			0
’ ‘ keeping our digestive health in tip - top condition is vital for weight management as well as our overall health			2
’ the study , by @entity62 in @entity63 , aimed to prevent obesity associated with a high - fat and high sugar diet			1
the mice ‘ ate fat and sugar , and did not gain weight , while their control littermates did , ’ said @entity66 , professor in the @entity67 at the university			2
‘ we showed that the @entity9 receptor in neurons that produce @entity77 could control responses to a high - fat diet without resulting in obesity			1
' @entity77 neurons are found in the hypothalamus and regulate food intake			0
they are the neurons that when activated make us feel full and curb appetite			0
@entity9 regulates the activation of these neurons			0
professor @entity66 and her team genetically engineered mice to delete the @entity9 receptor from @entity77 neurons in order to see if they could stop obesity , despite the creatures eating a sugary and fatty diet			1
‘ when we blocked @entity9 in these hypothalamic cells , we found an increased level of free radical formation in @entity77 neurons , and they were more active , ’ she said			1
while the findings could potentially solve the widespread obesity crisis , they could also have implications for people with diabetes			1
@entity109 gamma is a target of a class of drug called thiazolidinedione ( @entity114 ) – used to treat type 2 diabetes – which lowers glucose levels - but at the cost of some patients gaining weight			1
the findings could have implications for people with diabetes.the scientists think that people treated with the thiazolidinedione drugs such as @entity125 ( illustrated ) gain weight as a side effect , but that future medication could solve this problem ‘ our study suggests that the increased weight gain in diabetic patients treated with @entity114 could be due to the effect of this drug in the brain , ' ' professor @entity66 said			1
' therefore , targeting peripheral @entity9 to treat type 2 diabetes should be done by developing @entity114 compounds that ca n’t penetrate the brain			1
' she believes it may also be possible to keep the benefits of @entity114 without the side - effects of weight gain			2
‘ our next steps in this research are to test this theory in diabetes mouse models , ’ she said			0
the study was published in @entity148 .			0

researchers from @entity62 have blocked the effects of the nuclear receptor @entity9 in a small number of brain cells in mice
this caused the animals to become resistant to a high fat diet
findings could cure obesity and could also have implications for diabetes
could be used to create new drugs to manage type 2 diabetes without weight - gaining side effects
