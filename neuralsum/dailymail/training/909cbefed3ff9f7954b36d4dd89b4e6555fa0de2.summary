shake - up : a review ordered by education secretary @entity2 says children should be made to study history and geography to improve standards pupils may be forced to study history and geography until they are 16 under plans for a shake - up of the national curriculum			1
an independent review ordered by education secretary @entity2 called for the move yesterday as part of a wider drive to address concerns that @entity18 ’s schools are falling behind the rest of the world			1
a separate report yesterday warned of a sharp decline in history teaching , with 159 schools not entering a single pupil for a gcse in the subject last year			1
recent studies have exposed a shocking ignorance about history among school - leavers			1
one found that half of all 18 to 24 - year - olds did not know @entity34 led the @entity35 to victory at the @entity37 , with a similar proportion unaware that the @entity39 built @entity40			1
under the proposals , all pupils in @entity18 would be required to study history , geography , a foreign language , design and technology and the arts until at least 16 , even if they are not planning to take a gcse in them			1
at present pupils can drop these subjects at 14			0
an expert panel appointed by mr @entity2 found that the curriculum in @entity18 narrows earlier than in countries with more successful education systems , where pupils are required to study key subjects such as history for longer			2
as a result , many youngsters are ‘ deprived of access to powerful forms of knowledge and experience at a formative time in their lives ’ , the panel said			0
gaps in knowledge : under the proposals , teenagers would have to study history , geography , a foreign language , design and technology and the arts until at least 16 even if they do n't sit the gcse a move to make these subjects compulsory would tie in with the government ’s new @entity77 , awarded to pupils who gain at least five cs at @entity81 in @entity18 , maths , science , history or geography and a foreign language			1
@entity88 mp @entity87 , vice-chairman of the all - party history group , warned that the decline in history teaching had potentially far - reaching consequences			2
mr @entity87 , who will use a @entity95 debate today to call for history to be made compulsory , said : ‘ at the moment we are the only country in @entity100 , apart from @entity101 , that allows children to finish history at 14			2
warning : mp @entity104 will use a commons debate today to call for history to be made compulsory ‘ there are dozens of schools where not a single pupil is studying history beyond that point			1
‘ yet history is a subject that binds us as a nation			2
having a common understanding of the past helps us to create a more coherent and tolerant society			0
’ mr @entity87 said the subject was becoming increasingly confined to the most academic schools , particularly in the south			0
yesterday ’s proposals are part of wider reforms designed to boost @entity18 ’s competitiveness by improving the curriculum			0
other suggestions include requiring children to learn their times tables at a younger age			0
n @entity134 teachers should be ordered to smarten up , the incoming head of @entity132 said yesterday			0
sir @entity135 said teachers should set an example and dress in a ‘ professional ’ manner			0
he added : ‘ i think it ’s patronising to children for staff to dress poorly			0

aims to address fears that standards are falling behind rest of the world
