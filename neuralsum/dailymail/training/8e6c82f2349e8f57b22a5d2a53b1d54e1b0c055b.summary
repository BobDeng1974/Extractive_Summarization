@entity0 begins his 22nd year as a professional at the @entity2 on thursday and he 's relishing the prospect more than any other season in recent times			1
it 's amazing what a win can do for a man , but it was also the manner of the @entity11 's triumph in his last event in @entity13 last month that has transformed his outlook			1
' most of my recent wins have come when i have been a few ahead in the final round , so it was nice to make up shots on the final day and do so by holing a lot of good putts , ' he said			2
@entity0 picks the ball out of a hole on the practice green ahead of the @entity2 @entity0 watches an iron shot during a challenge match in aid of @entity28 in @entity29 ' i ca n't remember when i last felt that comfortable on the greens battling down the stretch			1
you 'd have to go back years , but that 's how you 've got to feel if you 're going to win tournaments			1
' i remember when i was young i shot a lot of 63s and 64s to win and it 's like a habit â€“ once you start doing it , it becomes easier and easier			1
and it 's a lovely feeling			2
why it starts happening i do n't know			2
there 's no panic to your game , even if you miss a couple of putts or shots early on			2
you just remain calm , and things start to happen in your favour			2
' the belief started to return following his excellent performance at the @entity54 in september			0
' if you 're a captain 's pick you 're always under a bit more pressure , so it was nice to play well for @entity59 ( @entity60 ) and return his faith , ' said the 41 year old @entity11			1
' so it had an influence			0
but , to be honest , i 'd put in a lot of hard work before that , and i felt it was going to pay off			0
' @entity0 emerged victorious at the @entity69 in @entity70 last month @entity0 ( third from left ) poses with stars including @entity72 ( @entity73 ) and @entity74 ( r ) in @entity29 @entity0 has put in the hours in the gym during the off - season and looks fitter than he has for some time			1
it certainly paid off last week while on holiday in @entity79 , where he saved a man from drowning by carrying him out of the water			1
' i only did what anyone would have done under the circumstances , ' said the modest @entity86 , who was as surprised as anyone when the man he saved decided to put the story in the public domain			0
the man in question said he hoped the gods would shine on @entity0 to the extent he would win three majors , but @entity86 himself would assuredly settle for one			1
' that 's the goal this year as always but i 'm not going to put pressure on myself , ' he said			0
' i 'll be going to enjoy them , and i like the venues this year			0
i 've always done well in recent years at the masters , and the @entity100 is being staged at a new course that is supposed to have tight fairways and small greens , so that will suit me			1
and i 've finished runner - up in an @entity100 at @entity105 , so yes , there 's plenty of reasons for me to look forward to them			0
' @entity0 admits he is feeling comfortable on the greens after suffering putting problems in recent years the @entity11 is hoping to win his first major as he begins his 22nd year as a professional the one change this year will come as good news to his many admirers in these isles			1
although he will continue to be based in @entity117 , @entity0 will play more in @entity118			1
as well as the @entity119 at @entity120 and @entity121 , he will add the @entity123 and @entity124 opens , plus the @entity125 in @entity126			0
' for a couple of years in @entity129 it has been nice to go easy on the travelling but i 've missed not playing in those events , ' he said			2
' the @entity133 always has a special atmosphere and the @entity135 is held in a great spot in @entity137 , while @entity138 in @entity126 is a spectacular place			0
so the ambition is still the same , and i want to get back in the world 's top ten			0
i know my game is good enough and i do n't see anything to scare me out there			0
' sounds like the old @entity86 , does n't he ? with renewed confidence , it 's going to be interesting to see how he gets on .			0

@entity0 will play in the @entity2 this week
the @entity11 is in confident mood after winning in @entity13 last month
@entity0 is yet to win a major in his 21 years as a professional
