by @entity0 @entity1 went into work today as he remains on bail ahead of his sentencing hearing on friday victims of disgraced pr expert @entity1 could sue him for his millions following his convictions for indecent assault			1
the 71 - year - old was found guilty of carrying out sex attacks on four victims yesterday , with a jury clearing him of assaults on two other women			1
the convictions , the first under the @entity17 investigation set up in the wake of the @entity20 scandal , could now pave the way for a string of civil law suits			1
lawyers say the jury 's verdicts will strengthen any case for damages brought before civil courts , with victims able to claim damages for any trauma or potential loss of earnings caused by his offences			1
@entity37 , who represents over 150 complainants in the @entity40 inquiry for law firm @entity41 , said : ' the victims have already proven their case to the higher standard of proof required in a criminal trial , so would have good grounds to bring a civil case			2
' they will have to make claims against him individually rather than any organisation , but he is a man of significant assets			0
' it emerged yesterday that there were 23 alleged victims who came forward to police , but prosecutors decided to proceed only with what they perceived to be the strongest cases			1
experts say the civil claims may not be limited to those accusers whose claims led to conviction , meaning other women could also sue @entity1			1
@entity67 , expert in abuse claims at law firm @entity69 , added : ' others may not have as strong a case , but the standard of proof is lower in civil proceedings so , it would be a challenge for them , but it does n't necessarily mean their cases would fail			1
' the time limit for bringing claims of this kind is the victim 's 21st birthday or three years from the date of the abuse			2
' but exceptions are made in cases where victims can still get a fair hearing			0
the fact that there has so recently been a fair trial of the facts in this case means victims would have a very strong claim that they are still in time			0
' the @entity97 refused to confirm whether further alleged victims have come forward since @entity1 's conviction yesterday			1
@entity1 has two large homes in @entity101 , @entity102 , one he valued at £ 3.5million in 2008 and another , which his daughter @entity103 lives in , he valued at £ 2.5million five years ago			2
@entity1 , pictured leaving his home in @entity105 yesterday , could be set to lose his millions to compensation claims from his victims the @entity108 says property prices in the area have increased by around five per cent a year since then , meaning the two homes could now have a combined worth of up to £ 8million			1
the pr expert also has a house in an exclusive golf development in the hills near @entity117 , southern @entity118 , which he valued at £ 1.5million in 2008			0
@entity1 has said he made £ 2.5million a year from his pr work			2
the latest accounts for his company , @entity122 , in 2012 show a turnover of around £ 3.5million and give the firm an estimated worth of £ 1.2million			0
@entity1 has also boasted he gets a new @entity125 - each worth £ 200,000 - every two years			1
@entity1 is bundled into a car after he was found guilty of eight counts of indecent assault at @entity129 yesterday the disgraced publicist was seen arriving at his scaled - down offices in @entity132 , @entity105 today , a far cry from his former palatial hq in @entity136 's @entity135			2
@entity137 said they thought he would stay at home while he awaits his sentencing hearing on friday and were surprised to see him out and about			0
one local , who asked not to be named said : ' you would have thought he 'd keep his head down knowing the fate awaiting him but his appearance today in public only underscores his arrogance			0
' @entity1 has said his lawyers have advised him not to comment on his situation			0
prosecutors are still deciding how to deal with one count of indecent assault upon which the jury could not reach a verdict			0
@entity1 continues to deny that charge .			0
