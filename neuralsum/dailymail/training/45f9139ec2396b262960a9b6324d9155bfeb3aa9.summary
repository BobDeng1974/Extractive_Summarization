when asked to say which car the main party leaders would be voters named the retro car or a ‘ four - by - four with illegal bull bars on the front ’			2
@entity9 , meanwhile , is seen as ‘ something smooth ’ like a @entity39 or a @entity40 , according to focus groups quizzed by the @entity8 peer @entity43			1
deputy prime minister @entity44 was seen as a @entity45 – or a people carrier , carrying round everybody else ’s baggage			0
@entity10 was more difficult to pin down			0
one voter said he was a @entity50 – because he was ‘ average ’ , but changed their mind because the ‘ a @entity50 is reliable ’			0
mr @entity9 used a speech in @entity54 today to set out the ‘ moral and practical ’ case for cutting taxes			2
he hopes to contrast conservative policies on tax , welfare and growth with @entity3 ’s lack of trust on the economy			0
but the prime minister has yet to persuade voters that he has their best interest at heart			0
detailed polling shows more than two - thirds of voters think mr @entity9 ‘ does n’t understand the lives of people like me ’ , that the conservative party cares ‘ more about the rich and affluent than ordinary people ’ and that the @entity8 party ‘ contains many people with bigoted and intolerant views ’			1
almost half - 46 per cent say – mr @entity9 has ‘ no clear principles ’ , and 42 per cent think the @entity8 are still the ‘ nasty party ’			1
however , 48 per cent say the @entity1 will take ‘ tough but necessary ’ decisions			2
meanwhile , mr @entity9 's personal net satisfaction rating has improved markedly in recent weeks , up to 7 per cent , while mr @entity10 's has tumbled to minus 50			2
the five - point lead on the ‘ forced question ’ of who voters would prefer in power is the highest in a @entity89 / @entity88 survey for two years			0
at the same time , @entity3 is three points ahead when voters are asked who they intend to vote for , with the views of those planning to support smaller parties likely to decide the outcome of the election			0
on the forced question , @entity99 supporters back the @entity1 over @entity3 by 50 per cent to 18			0
@entity102 ’s @entity101 said : ‘ @entity103 , the @entity1 feel frustrated that so many of their past supporters have moved to @entity99			0
‘ however , our figures suggest that the @entity1 may be able to win many of them back in the key marginals by stressing their message , “ vote @entity27 , get @entity10 ”			2
’ support for a @entity8 government with mr @entity9 at the helm has remained steady at 40 or 41 per cent for the last two years			1
@entity9 's personal net satisfaction has improved markedly in recent weeks , despite two thirds of voters thinking he ' does n’t understand the lives of people like me ' @entity9 and @entity119 , pictured today , helping to make cider at @entity121 in @entity122 , @entity123 labour leader @entity10 , pictured today , visiting to the @entity124 in @entity125 69 % @entity9 does n’t understand the lives of people like me 46 % @entity9 has no clear principles 69 % the conservatives care more about the rich and affluent than ordinary people 63 % underneath the surface the conservative party contains many people with bigoted and intolerant views 67 % the conservatives are too close to big business and the banks 48 % the conservatives are prepared to make the tough but necessary decisions the country needs 34 % the conservative party have changed for the better since their time in opposition 25 % the conservative party cares about helping all groups in society , not just the few 42 % it is true today that the @entity8 are the ' nasty party ' the increase in the @entity8 lead is a result of falling enthusiasm for a @entity3 government			1
‘ @entity10 ’s reputation and @entity3 ’s support have declined , but @entity9 ’s and the @entity8 ’ figures have not improved , ’ mr @entity152 writes in @entity153			1
‘ in short , many voters have lost faith in @entity3 but not transferred their affections to the @entity1			1
’ there was renewed speculation at the weekend that the @entity162 could prop up a minority @entity3 administration			0
@entity162 leader @entity165 suggested it would be better for the whole of @entity168 if nationalists were sitting in a @entity170			0
mr @entity9 said the remarks were further evidence of the need for a @entity8 government			1
speaking in @entity54 , he said : ' if there was anyone who thought the worst possible outcome of the election was an @entity10 - led @entity3 government , actually i can now tell you something that would be even worse , and that is @entity10 in @entity122 , supported by the @entity162 who want to break up our @entity168			2
‘ the battle of this election has become even more important			0
' however , mr @entity152 said cautioned that this approach will not be enough to secure an overall majority for the conservatives			0
‘ frightening @entity99 supporters with the nightmare of a @entity10 government could help the @entity1 remain ahead of @entity3 – but wo n’t be enough to reach the 326 seats needed for an overall majority in the new @entity196			1

41 % want @entity8 government with @entity9 , 36 % want @entity3 with @entity10
pollsters say ‘ many voters have lost faith in @entity3 ’ over last two years
