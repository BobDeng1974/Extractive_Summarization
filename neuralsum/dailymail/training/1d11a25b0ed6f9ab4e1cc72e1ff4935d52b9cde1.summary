by @entity0 published : 10:39 est , 13 december 2013 updated : 20:51 est , 13 december 2013 one of the government ’s first flagship free schools was axed yesterday after inspectors condemned its poor teaching standards			1
the @entity5 in @entity6 , @entity7 , was among the first free schools to open under the @entity9 in 2011			1
however , it will now be the first to be closed down after the @entity11 decided to terminate its funding , and parents of the 65 pupils will be forced to find places elsewhere from april			1
free schools are state - funded but free of local authority control , and can be set up by parents , groups of teachers and charitable trusts			1
some 174 have opened , including 93 this year alone			2
closure : the @entity5 on @entity6 , @entity7 is to shut after inspectors found none of the teachers provided good quality lessons flagship : the school was one of the first of 24 to open in 2011 @entity5 – which has received millions of pounds of state funding – was declared failing and placed in special measures by @entity34 in may			1
it was re-inspected in november when it was warned that not enough progress was being made			0
yesterday , schools minister @entity36 wrote to @entity5 ’s chairman of governors , @entity37 , warning him that the @entity11 was terminating its funding agreement			1
in his letter to mr @entity37 , @entity36 said he had expressed ‘ grave concerns ’ about the primary school ’s education standards			1
he added : ‘ none of the school ’s teachers were delivering good lessons and all were still consistently inadequate or required improvement			2
’ the letter said it was also unclear whether the trust running the school , which was supposed to be part of the @entity54 movement , had identified what was needed to make improvements			2
it said : ‘ the staff are currently unable to deliver teaching and learning even at the most basic level , with the consequence for the pupils of continued inadequate teaching for an unacceptable length of time			0
’ blow : the closure of the @entity68 is a significant setback for education secretary @entity71 's flagship reforms the closure is hugely damaging for education secretary @entity71 ’s free schools programme and comes after a damning @entity34 report into the country ’s first @entity76 free school , @entity78 in @entity79			1
a @entity11 spokesman said : ‘ since [ @entity5 ] was placed in special measures in may we have monitored progress closely			1
the trust has not provided evidence they are making the changes required			0
lord @entity36 has today notified the trust that the department will terminate its funding agreement at the end of the spring term			2
plans for the first new grammar school in 50 years were thrown out yesterday			2
@entity96 councillors in @entity97 hoped to use newly relaxed @entity9 rules on school expansions to create an ‘ annexe ’ to an existing grammar in @entity101 that could take up to 1,300 pupils			0
but the @entity11 dismissed the plan , saying it was the ‘ establishment of a new selective school ’ rather than an expansion , which is not allowed by law			0
campaigners reacted angrily , claiming that the law needs to be changed to give parents choice over their children ’s education			0
‘ we are now working with @entity115 to ensure the children have suitable alternatives in place and their transition is as smooth as possible			0
’ @entity120 , general secretary of the @entity121 , said : ‘ when a school closes it is the children who suffer and their education that is affected			0
there will be many worried parents in the run - up to @entity129 concerned about what this means for their child ’s education			0
‘ the blame for the closure of this school lies squarely with @entity71 and his free school programme , which has failed to ensure schools opened under the policy can provide a decent standard of education			1
’ @entity144 , chief executive of the @entity145 , said : ‘ we advised the @entity11 to allow us to oversee the implementation of the @entity54 element and curriculum			0
‘ that advice was ignored and the result is the waste of a large amount of money , the name of @entity54 tarnished and a large number of parents very badly let down			0

@entity5 in @entity7 to close by april next year
ministers pull the plug on funding after ' grave concerns ' about standards
school was among the first of 24 free schools to open in 2011
it was placed in special measures by @entity34 in april but did not improve
