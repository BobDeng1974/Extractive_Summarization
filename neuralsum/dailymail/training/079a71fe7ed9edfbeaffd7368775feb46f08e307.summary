by @entity0 on an individual level there were occasional moments of brilliance from @entity5 during @entity7 ’s draw with @entity8 - not least his fabulous series of skills in the fourth minute and his perfect assist for @entity12 's late leveller - but collectively his team suffered because of his positioning , or lack of it			1
in the first half he started on the left of a forward three , but minutes in he was yards away from @entity20 on the right			0
his unpredictable movements , perhaps in part to do with the knee injury that has been troubling him this last month , made it difficult for his team - mates to know where to play			0
there was one passage of play that had fans of both sides on their feet in the opening minutes of the game			0
after stealing the ball from @entity48 on the left he drove forward , chopped inside a challenge from @entity51 , pulled off a @entity53 turn to get away from @entity54 , and then stroked the ball from one foot to the other as @entity51 came in for a second helping			0
somehow , @entity5 emerged with the ball on the other side , where he teed it off to @entity61			2
magic : @entity5 spins past the challenge of @entity51 as he bewilders three @entity8 players in one dribble other than that dribble his first half was punctuated by overhit passes and hugely ambitious attempts on goal that flew way off target			1
on more than one occasion it was the pitch that let him down - if his dramatic gestures were anything to go by			0
off target : his set pieces were below - par against @entity8 , with a number of free - kicks flying high and wide his tactical indiscipline left @entity7 ’s left side wide open , and @entity8 boss @entity83 was clever enough to exploit it			1
in need of a spark : @entity5 was isolated at times as his team - mates failed to provide him with chances chance after chance was created down @entity8 's right and it was surprising the @entity92 were not level at the break , after @entity20 had lifted an effort over @entity96 to give @entity7 an early lead			1
@entity92 threw players forward after the break and @entity100 made it 1 - 1 with a phenomenal swerving effort that @entity5 would have been proud of			2
then , the inevitable happened , @entity83 's side scored from an attack down their right			0
@entity106 failed to clear the cross and @entity108 had a shot saved , before the ball was cannoned back in by @entity111 and @entity112 was on hand to deflect it over the line			0
goal of the night : @entity51 celebrates after pulling @entity8 level with a wonderful individual goal yet , when @entity121 's side were chasing a late equaliser , there was @entity5			1
four - and - a - half minutes into the allotted five of added time , the @entity123 forward received the ball in space on the right and whipped an inch - perfect cross to the back post for @entity12 to thump a header home			2
saviour : an incredible cross by @entity5 sets up @entity12 's equaliser for @entity7 that made it 2 - 2 in @entity136 late drama : @entity12 peels away in celebration after nodding @entity5 's cross past @entity96 one perfect cross : @entity5 points to the heavens after providing a moment of class when his team needed him			1

@entity7 left it late to grab a point against @entity8 at the @entity148
@entity5 *flickered* in and out of the game as @entity8 nearly *shocked* @entity7
but when his team needed him most he provided an assist for @entity12
@entity7 need a win in their final game to have any hope of qualifying
