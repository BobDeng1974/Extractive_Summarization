@entity0 said there had been an @entity3 cover - up of child abuse there was an @entity3 cover - up of horrific child abuse because powerful figures looked after themselves , former judge @entity0 warned today			1
senior members of @entity11 society in the past did not think child abuse was as serious or important as protecting politicians and other members of the elite , she suggested			1
@entity0 was forced to quit as chairman of the wide - ranging inquiry into allegations of a cover - up because her brother was in the @entity21 in the 1980s			1
but she insisted if she had stayed in post and been able to run the inquiry she would have ' cut the whole thing open '			2
@entity0 's resignation in july came less than a week after @entity26 agreed to an inquiry into allegations that politicians , the police , the judiciary , celebrities , the @entity33 , the @entity34 and the @entity35 conspired to cover - up abuse over several decades			1
it followed concerns that her brother @entity40 sat in the @entity21 as attorney general during the 1980s - the period on which claims of a cover - up are focussed			1
@entity0 insisted she could have done the job , arguing that ' as a judge with 35 years ' experience on the bench , i was quite able to be independent and say that people got it wrong and to be critical of them '			1
speaking on @entity52 's today programme , which she guest edited today , she said abuse over decades was kept from public view			1
' i do believe the establishment has in the past looked after itself , partly because people did not really recognise the seriousness of child abuse and they did not think it was so important , and it was important to protect members of the establishment , ' she said			2
' so i would want to go in with a knife and cut the whole thing open and expose it , as to what happened , bearing in mind , of course , that the views of those people are not the views of people today and that is a difficulty			0
' she said she took the job of chairing the inquiry not because she want to do it but it ' needed to be done '			2
' it never crossed my mind that my brother would be an impediment			2
' in october the second chairman of the inquiry , @entity82 , was forced to resign after failing to declare the extent of her links to @entity88 peer @entity86 , who was allegedly handed a dossier detailing abuse			1
an mp battling to expose a suspected @entity93 child sex ring has been accused by fellow politicians of ‘ peddling conspiracy theories ’			2
@entity96 said he has been vilified for championing those who claim they were abused by paedophiles in positions of power			0
but the @entity102 mp said he will not be deterred from pursuing a full public inquiry into their ordeal			0
he said time was running out for the authorities to get to the bottom of claims aimed at the heart of the @entity3			1
the government is expected to announce the timescale and terms of reference for an inquiry within weeks			0
campaigners are gearing up for a crunch meeting at @entity118 in a fortnight as police continue to probe claims three boys were abused and murdered			0
groups representing victims and survivors of abuse warned home secretary @entity126 may they were losing confidence in the inquiry			1
but @entity0 said that effectively giving campaign groups the final decision on who chairs the inquiry ' creates real problems '			1
she said : ' i worry that the victims , survivors - for whom i have the most enormous sympathy , and as a judge i tried a great many child abuse cases , i really have huge sympathy for them - but for them to be deciding who should become the person chairing it creates real problems			1
' because if you did not have , in the past , a position of authority , how are you going to be able to run the inquiry ? ' you need someone who knows how to run things and if you get someone from an obscure background with no background of establishment , they will find it very difficult and may not be able , actually , to produce the goods			0
' she also defended the decision to make @entity82 a dame in the @entity157 , so soon after her resignation			0
she said criticism of the honour was ' very unfair ' as it was in recognition of her term as lord mayor of @entity165			0
defending the decision to award the honour , she said : ' she was lord mayor of @entity165 , she is only the second woman ever to be lord mayor of @entity165			0
@entity82 ( pictured ) becomes a dame two months after being forced to resign as chairman of the government 's child abuse inquiry ' the very least that the honours system could do would be to honour a woman who has got such a distinguished post			1
' unfortunately she had , like myself , a brief period where she had agreed - for goodness sake , she had agreed to do a very disagreeable job to become chairman			0
' and because she happened to know @entity86 , she was unacceptable to the survivors and therefore she stood down			0
' but @entity102 mp @entity181 , who exposed the @entity183 child sex scandal , said the damehood ' seems inappropriate ' , adding : ' i can think of many more worthy recipients … once again it looks like the @entity3 are looking after their own			2
' he added : ' the public will be disappointed that people such as @entity82 are receiving honours when there are people who are much more worthy of an honour , people who have done courageous things , or have achieved things for their country			0
' i 'm sure her achievements warrant an honour but the timing is a bit off			0
i suspect some people might be upset and it might have been more appropriate to let a bit of time elapse			0
