by @entity0 published : 21:24 est , 3 march 2014 updated : 06:48 est , 4 march 2014 families are paying more on average for part - time childcare than they spend on their mortgage , according to a new report			1
it reveals parents are handing over more than £ 7,500 a year for childcare for two children , around 4.7 per cent more than the average mortgage bill			1
the report , by the @entity13 and @entity14 , also suggests that some families may be spending more on childcare than they do on their weekly shopping			1
families are paying more on average for part - time childcare than they spend on their mortgage , according to a new report the study is based on information gathered by the @entity14 from local authority family or children 's information services in @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity28			1
each authority was asked to give the cost of 25 hours and 50 hours of childcare as provided by nurseries and childminders			0
they were also asked to give figures on the average cost of 15 hours childcare in an after - school club , or for a childminder picking youngsters up from school			0
it found that a family with one two - year - old child attending nursery part - time ( 25 hours a week ) and a five - year - old in an after - school club will pay out £ 7,549 a year on average			2
this is higher than the @entity50 average annual @entity50 mortgage , which the report says is £ 7,207 according to official data			2
for a family with two youngsters in full - time childcare the average yearly cost is £ 11,700 , the report adds , 62 per cent higher than the average yearly mortgage bill for a family home			1
the study says that since 2002 , childcare costs have risen more than inflation each year and that international data shows that parents in @entity50 hand over more than a quarter of their salary ( 26.6 per cent ) , more than most other @entity69 nations			1
for a family with two youngsters in full - time childcare the average yearly cost is £ 11,700 in the last five years alone , the price of part - time nursery care for a child under two has risen by 27 per cent , with parents paying around £ 1,214 more in 2014 than in 2009			1
the report concludes : ' our research shows that the current childcare system is not working for anyone			2
' children are losing out on vital early education and families remain trapped in poverty because they can not make work pay			2
' childcare providers struggle with debts			0
women fail to return to the labour market after they have children and the economy loses their skills and their taxes			0
' the state faces greater welfare bills and high administrative costs for delivering a complex support system			0
' the @entity14 's report warns that 25 hours in a nursery for a child aged under two costs an average of £ 109.89 a week - which it calculates is twice the average price of a weekly food bill ( £ 56.80 a week )			1
overall , during the last 12 months , nursery costs for under twos have risen in all areas of @entity50 , it says , with an average increase of 3.3 per cent			0
it adds that the cost of after - school clubs has fallen in @entity26 and @entity28 , but not in @entity27			0
@entity112 , chief executive at @entity13 said : ' when even part - time childcare costs outstrip the average mortgage for a family home - and many parents have to spend more than a quarter of their income on childcare - it 's clear that our childcare system is n't fit for purpose			1
' we need a childcare system that helps parents who want to work and contribute to the economy and gives children the best start in life			2
@entity129 and @entity14 wants to see all political parties commit to a long - term childcare strategy that delivers for parents , providers , and crucially , for children			1
' @entity135 's shadow childcare minister @entity134 said : ' under @entity137 childcare costs are soaring , adding pressure to family life and shutting parents out of work			0
' at the same time as sky - high costs , there are fewer places available and wages are down £ 1,600 a year			0
rather than help families facing a cost - of - living crisis , this @entity150 - led government has slashed tax credit support for childcare and hit family finances so that work does n’t pay			0
