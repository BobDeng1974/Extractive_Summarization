while most of us will happily splash out on a deluxe kitchen or the perfect leather chesterfield , decorating the humble toilet is often overlooked when it comes to home improvements			2
but if you 've been neglecting your loo , then you might be missing a trick as these incredible pictures show			0
from the toilet that cleans itself to the £ 3 million bling bog encrusted with jewels , it seems that not everyone is happy with a lick of paint and a porcelain potty when it comes to decorating the lavatory			2
among the eye catching examples is a space toilet , complete with a vacuum flush that pulls waste away from the astronaut 's body , the intergalactic privy , which is to be found at @entity29 's @entity28 , also has a royal fan in the shape of the @entity32 who inspected it during a visit to @entity36 in 2008			2
bling : this @entity38 bathroom is made from solid gold and the toilet alone is worth £ 3million			1
visitors have to wear shoe coverings to avoid scratching the golden floor @entity44 : the @entity47 ' @entity46 ' toilet disinfects itself after every use while @entity50 's effort allows you to poo while enjoying the surrounding view although the @entity54 leads the way when it comes to eye catching toilets , courtesy of one @entity38 store 's £ 3million gold toilet encrusted with jewels , there are plenty of creative commodes closer to home			1
across the @entity65 in @entity47 is the @entity46 , a self - cleaning public restroom			0
after a patron exits the restroom , a 60 - second wash cycle begins inside the toilet , and the toilet fixture itself is scrubbed and disinfected automatically			0
in @entity75 , the most striking entry into the toilet hall of fame is architect @entity77 's spectacular creation made from one - way glass which sits outside the @entity79			1
initially intended for use in prisons , the designer bog lets you take in your surroundings while dealing with your bodily necessities in peace			0
another technically advanced throne is the ' @entity89 ' toilet found in the bathroom of @entity75 restaurant , sketch			1
guests at the celebrity hangout can climb into little egg shaped capsules in order to complete their business			0
but though the eggs look high tech , they are n't a patch on the @entity103 ' @entity102 ' found in @entity29			0
hidden : despite the glass walls ( and the ability to see out ) , @entity105 's bog is made from one way glass which means that passersby definitely ( we hope ) ca n't see in out of this world : this space toilet , complete with a special vacuum , was seen by @entity114 during a visit to the @entity28 in @entity29 totally potty ! @entity29 's ' @entity102 ' have pressure sensors at the back which allow users to play urine operated video games while carrying out their personal business the unusual urinals come complete with games that you play by accurately aiming urine at a pressure sensor located at the back of the urinal			1
the four games include ' @entity129 ' , which enables the toilet goes to use their stream to erase graffiti on a wall and ' @entity134 ' - named for the @entity136 landmark - that measures how much urine has been expelled			0
in ' @entity141 and me ' , the strength of the urine stream produced determines how much a virtual girl 's skirt gets blown up by the wind			0
finally , in ' @entity146 : milk from nose ' the user has to try and beat the previous urinator 's stream strength			0
in addition to its bling bog , @entity38 also boasts urinals with entertainment included , although the former @entity157 colony has chosen not to offer video games , instead plumping for tv shows			2
back in @entity36 , there 's also an underwater toilet built into the side of an aquarium in @entity164 as well as a toilet that simulates the feeling of taking off from a ski jump at the @entity169 hotel in @entity170			2
scary though the ski jump commode might prove for some , nothing is more likely to induce bowel - loosening terror than @entity176 's bottomless bathroom			1
located at the top of the 15 - storey @entity179 in @entity180 , the toilet is perched atop an open lift shaft and was built , according to architects @entity183 , with ' concepts of transparency and the simplicity of materials ' in mind			1
terrifying : @entity180 's bottomless bog overlooks a 15 - storey drop , making @entity192 's ' @entity89 ' toilets look positively benign by comparison slippery slope : the toilet at the @entity169 hotel in @entity36 's @entity170 makes you feel as if you 're atop a mountain and ready to tackle a scary ski jump high tech : while you ca n't play games with them , the public urinals in @entity38 's @entity205 shopping mall do come complete with individual televisions to entertain you			1

the @entity54 has the most creative approach to toilet design , with ski simulators and ' @entity102 ' among those on offer
@entity75 is home to a spectacular one - way glass toilet , while in @entity38 , you *'ll* find a throne worth £ 3million
the world 's scariest loo is perched atop a 15 - storey lift shaft in the city of @entity180 in @entity176
