finding space for all the @entity2 guests is never easy – even in a mansion like the @entity5 ’s estate at @entity6			1
but then , not many families have the option of stashing their relatives in the servants ’ quarters			0
her majesty has invited the largest gathering in decades to celebrate @entity15 ’s first @entity2 , meaning her frantic staff will have to put some visitors in servants ’ rooms			2
the @entity5 and prince @entity20 arrived at @entity21 in @entity22 by train			1
the couple will host 30 royals at their nearby @entity6 estate for @entity2 although even with some 30 of her nearest and dearest arriving today , the @entity5 still could find no room for prince @entity29 ’s ex-wife , @entity28			1
the @entity30 and his daughters @entity32 and @entity33 are reportedly on the guest list , but their mother was left off			0
many who did get an invitation will have to share bedrooms , move to cottages on the estate or sleep in servants ’ quarters			1
it is quite a change from last year , when the @entity30 and @entity45 spent @entity2 with @entity45 ’s parents in @entity47 and prince @entity48 was on duty in @entity50			2
the year before , prince @entity20 was in hospital for an operation			1
those likely to have servants ’ rooms include the @entity5 ’s nephew @entity56 , his wife @entity57 and their children			2
his sister @entity59 , her husband @entity60 and children are also likely to be included			0
the @entity30 and @entity45 , pictured with their son @entity15 , spent last @entity2 with her parents in @entity47 though sprawling by most 's measures , the @entity6 estate will still struggle to house all 30 guests they could be housed in what is known as the @entity67 because it houses single male staff members , usually chefs and kitchen porters			1
the influx of guests could see them relegated to the footmen ’s bedrooms			0
off the list : prince @entity29 's former wife @entity28 was not invited a source said : ‘ @entity6 is a large house but everyone will be crammed in like sardines			0
there are just so many young royals now with children and the numbers keep going up			0
‘ it ’s great for the @entity5 but a nightmare to cater for			0
’ @entity6 , in @entity22 , has been the private home of four generations of @entity89 monarchs since 1862			2
despite being set in 600 acres of woodland , the house is small by royal standards and quarters are said to be ‘ cramped ’			0
the @entity5 will insist on guests joining her today			0
the family follow the @entity97 tradition of opening presents on christmas eve before donning black tie for a candlelit banquet			1
at 10pm , the women adjourn , leaving prince @entity20 to serve port or brandy to the men			1
on christmas morning , they attend @entity105 , the church on the estate , before a turkey lunch at 1pm			0
they watch the @entity111 message on television before playing games			2
prince @entity20 usually organises a @entity115 shoot .			1

some 30 members of the royal family to spend @entity2 at @entity22 estate
