@entity44 , director of the @entity9 , said : ' the public responded enthusiastically to our call for threatened buildings			1
' it shows the public cares - but it also shows there are still too many historic buildings at risk , without recognition or protection			1
' whether the solution is restoration or finding a new use for a building , it always takes money and often a long time			0
' in the meantime it â€™s vital that historic buildings are secured against weather and vandals			2
we owe it to future generations to ensure such memorable buildings are still around in 100 years			0
' the @entity9 is calling on the public to help in protecting historic buildings			1
a small @entity74 listed railway station which was closed with the 1960s rail cuts and has fallen into disrepair under private ownership a @entity74 listed pumphouse which originally contained a steam engine to operate the locks but has become derelict a @entity74 listed spillway that resembles a giant staircase			0

it is the only listed spillway in the @entity5 but is under threat from plans for a concrete replacement a @entity74 building which once boasted wood panelling and stained glass windows , but has been at the mercy of vandals , thieves and squatters since being sold to a private owner , the @entity9 said a tall @entity74 mortuary chapel with @entity100 stained glass windows which was closed and abandoned in the 1980s and now faces a bleak future with no obvious viable use a @entity74 church which was abandoned 20 years ago and now has rotten wood floors , crumbling stonework and a weathercock which was damaged by a low - flying @entity107 a grade ii * building paid for by rail workers , which contained the @entity5 's first lending library and ran many activities and classes , but which has become prey to vandals and arsonists since it closed in 1986 a meeting place of six roads which terminate at a statue of @entity119 suffered @entity121 damage that led to buildings being demolished			1
