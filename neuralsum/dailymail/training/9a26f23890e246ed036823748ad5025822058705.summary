by @entity1 reporter published : 22:27 est , 22 november 2012 updated : 08:41 est , 26 november 2012 he was a skinny bear with only one arm , who could do little more than scavenge for food in order to survive			1
but the disabled black bear made the crucial mistake of rummaging through bins at the upscale housing community in the @entity11 of @entity12			1
he was a common sight as he ambled along golf courses and the neighbourhood , but finally some residents had enough - particularly when he stole two pies from a kitchen counter - and he was shot dead by the area 's @entity20			1
now his death in @entity23 , about 35 miles north of @entity24 , has become a flashpoint for the community - with wildlife advocates and some residents outraged at the way the disabled bear was destroyed			1
killed : this three - legged bear was killed by management at the @entity23 development in @entity12 residents in the @entity23 community first saw the injured bear in november 2011			1
at the time , its right front leg was still attached but appeared to be hanging by a flap of skin			1
it is unclear how the leg was injured			0
when the bear reappeared in the spring , its leg was missing			1
construction workers building a house on the development began feeding the bear because he was so skinny , said @entity51 , who lives in the community			1
for some , @entity23 is their second home			0
so when they returned to the development for spring and summer , they began complaining about the bear breaking into homes			2
after the bear started breaking into homes looking for food , some people had enough			2
wildlife advocates scrambled to find a sanctuary for the animal , but time ran out : in august , the bear was shot and killed by management			1
those who were left distraught by what they say was an inhumane response say officials need to find non-lethal ways to handle so - called nuisance bears			2
' when it comes to nuisance bears , the state 's policy is simple : shoot them , ' @entity73 said			2
' and that 's just wrong			2
' pest : some residents of the wealthy @entity23 community complained about the bear 's presence @entity12 has seen a major resurgence in black bears			1
a generation ago , their numbers had dwindled because of hunting and development , and the animals were only found in the most remote mountains and coastal swamps			0
now there are about 15,000 black bears in @entity12 , with about 5,000 in the western @entity12			1
bear complaints began to increase in the 1990s , primarily in residential areas of western @entity12 where developers began building multimillion - dollar homes in gated communities			1
the number of bear complaints has doubled in the last decade - from 277 in 2001 to 671 in 2011 , according to the agency			1
many involve bears who have become too comfortable around humans			0
they wander into backyards , looking for food			0
most of the blame can be placed on humans , said @entity115 , a nature photographer and naturalist who tried to find a sanctuary for the three - legged bear			1
if people do not lock up garbage cans , bears will sift through the trash			0
if people leave food in bird feeders , bears will find it			0
' bears that have learned to get food from people - either direct feeding , or the garbage and bird feeders ... and they subsequently lose their fear of people , ' @entity126 said			2
management sent emails and posted notices advising people to keep their windows and doors closed on the ground level			0
some residents ignored the warnings , @entity144 said			2
by early summer , @entity144 and other activists were racing to find a sanctuary to take the bear			2
she said she begged for another day or two , but the community 's management refused , and the commission also offered no help			1
' everyone in our development wanted the bear to be removed , but most wanted him to be removed alive and taken to @entity160 , and not removed from our development dead in the back of a pickup truck , ' she said			1
' it was just devastating			0
' this is the latest controversy surrounding the @entity166			0
wildlife advocates were upset last year when state biologists killed nine penned deer on a homeowner 's property in @entity172			2
the commission said the deer were killed because they had to be tested for a fatal disease called chronic wasting , which can not be done on live animals			0
but the owner , @entity179 , and supporters said they were outraged			0
wildlife and environmental groups are also angry that the commission allowed overnight hunting of coyotes throughout @entity12 this year , including in the area inhabited by the only wild population of red wolves , one of the world 's most endangered animals			1
the groups opposed the rule because red wolves resemble coyotes and are hard to tell apart even during the day			0
@entity196 , chief of the agency 's @entity197 , said the @entity23 community decided to kill the three - legged bear			1
' this was an animal that had caused damage to property multiple times , and the property owners decided they were going to address that issue			2
and they did , ' he said			0
complaint : management at the community said they had no other way to deal with the bear but wildlife advocates say the state did not do enough to help them relocate the bear			0
' the idea of shooting bears should be an absolute last resort , ' said @entity219 , who lives on @entity220 and runs the @entity221			0
some states - mostly in the @entity223 - capture and relocate nuisance bears to remote wildlife settings			0
the @entity226 and @entity227 routinely relocates and removes black and grizzly bears as part of normal department operations			0
but in many states , there is no place remote enough to relocate them			0
and the bears seldom stay where they are released and may return to where they were caught			0
in @entity12 , the agency can relocate a bear but it is done on a case - by - case basis , and it usually only involves orphan cubs , @entity196 said			1
' there are very few places you can put a bear that wo n't be in somebody 's backyard , ' said @entity249 , the agency 's private lands program coordinator			1
upscale : many of the residents of @entity23 use the community as a vacation residence			0

@entity256 was a regular feature in @entity12 estate , and some residents took pity on disabled animal and fed him
but complaints led to area 's @entity20 shooting bear dead and *carting* corpse off in ' pickup truck '
fans of the bear begged for more time to *re-home* him - but were *over-ruled*
