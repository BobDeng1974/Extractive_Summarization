@entity0 has been hammered time and time again for the scandal which erupted after it emerged that she used her personal email account for government business			1
but she made light of the scandal at a gathering of reports on monday night , looking forward to ' new beginnings ' ... including a new address			1
@entity11 , who is expected to declare her bid for president in the coming weeks , even promised ' no more secrecy ' after weeks of being pressed to turn over @entity16 emails she had hitherto kept to herself			1
joker : @entity0 showed her lighter side , joking with reporters about her recent email scandal , and promising ' no more secrecy '			0
she is pictured about at a speech earlier on monday the former secretary of state and @entity25 , who was speaking at the awards ceremony for a political journalism prize , admitted it was odd for her to willingly put herself in the way of the press - but tried to spin the occasion as a fresh start			1
she said : ' i am well aware that some of you may be a little surprised to see me here tonight			1
you know my relationship with the press has been at times , shall we say , complicated			0
' ' ... but i am all about new beginnings			1
a new grandchild , another new hairstyle , a new email account – why not a new relationship with the press ? ' so here goes			2
no more zone of privacy - after all , what good does that do me			2
' prank : @entity11 joked that everyone at the prize - giving in @entity55 , had a non-disclosure agreement under their seat however , she could n't help but indulge her secretive side , even in jest , by pretending the guests would all be stopped from talking about the event with a legal gagging order			1
she said : ' but first of all , before i go any further , if you look under your chairs , you ’ll find a simple non-disclosure agreement			0
my attorneys drew it up			0
' she was speaking at a ceremony held for the @entity73 in @entity74 , which is awarded by @entity75			2
the event in @entity55 honors @entity77 , a political reporter who died in 2008 , but interviewed @entity11 several times in the preceding decades			1
@entity80 , a @entity81 reporter , won the $ 5,000 prize this year			2
the event could be one of @entity11 's last public appearances before announcing her much - anticipated candidacy for president in 2016			0
at one point in the her remarks at the event she seemed to make a joke about her longstanding position that she is still considering whether to run or not			0
it came on the day that @entity95 became the first to throw his hat into the ring and announce himself as the first official candidate in the presidential election			0
