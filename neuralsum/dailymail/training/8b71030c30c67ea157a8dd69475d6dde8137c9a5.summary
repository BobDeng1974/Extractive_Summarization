by @entity1 reporter published : 10:23 est , 8 august 2013 updated : 16:47 est , 8 august 2013 the @entity2 has now decided to scrap the @entity3 due to budget cuts instead of fixing the nuclear submarine , which a civilian shipyard worker set fire to in 2012 because he wanted to go home early			1
@entity2 officials said repairing the @entity11 , @entity12 - based sub would have meant canceling work on dozens of other ships because of new budget constraints into which the @entity3 ’s $ 450 million repairs just wo n’t fit			1
while @entity2 officials said the military 's overall readiness would be compromised if the @entity3 were given precedence over so many other ships , several representatives in @entity18 were quick to criticize the decision			1
scrapped : the @entity3 , a @entity25 - class attack sub was set on fire by civilian shipyard worker @entity27 in may 2012 and the @entity2 has now decided to scrap the vessel due to budget cuts ‘ the @entity2 and the nation simply can not afford to weaken other fleet readiness in the way that would be required to afford repairs to @entity3 , ’ said rear admiral @entity30 , director of undersea warfare			1
pricey : @entity36 is now serving 17 years in federal prison after admitting he intentionally set the fire that caused $ 450 million in damage to the @entity3 the @entity2 originally said it planned to repair the submarine but the discovery of additional damage raised the cost			1
the @entity25 - class attack sub was commissioned in 1990 at a cost of $ 900 million shipyard worker @entity36 , of @entity45 , @entity46 , was sentenced to 17 years in prison after admitting he set fire to the @entity3 , which was in dry dock during a 20 - month overhaul at the @entity52 shipyard			1
he said at the time that he was suffering from anxiety and having problems with his ex-girlfriend and set the blaze in order to get out of work early			2
it took 12 hours and the efforts of more than 100 firefighters to extinguish the flames			0
the fire , set on may 23 , 2012 , damaged forward compartments including living quarters , a command and control center and the torpedo room			0
weapons had been removed for the repair , and the fire never reached the rear of the submarine , where the nuclear propulsion components are located			0
@entity75 senators @entity74 and @entity76 of @entity77 and @entity78 and @entity79 of @entity46 issued a statement blaming the decision to scrap the submarine on the automatic budget cuts known as sequestration			1
‘ we are disappointed by the @entity2 's decision to discontinue repairs to the @entity3			2
inactivating the @entity3 will mean a loss to our nuclear submarine fleet — yet another unfortunate consequence of the across - the - board cuts known as sequestration			2
we will continue to work together to find a responsible budget solution that replaces sequestration , ’ they said			0
not worth it ? @entity2 officials say repairing the @entity3 , seen here in a 2004 photo , would harm the military 's overall readiness by taking resources away from dozens of other vessels in need of repair critics : several @entity75 lawmakers criticized the @entity2 's decision			1
' yet another unfortunate consequence of the across - the - board cuts known as sequestration , ' wrote @entity109 and @entity79 , among others the @entity2 announced last summer that it intended to repair the @entity3 with a goal of returning it to service in 2015			2
the @entity2 said it would be cost - effective because the 23 - year - old submarine could serve another 10 years			0
the decision to inactivate the @entity3 was a difficult one , ‘ taken after hard analysis and not made lightly , ’ @entity30 said in his statement			2
‘ but in exchange for avoiding the cost of repairs , we will open up funds to support other vital maintenance efforts , improving the wholeness and readiness of the fleet			0
’ the repairs have potential implications for both @entity128 workers and workers from @entity130 in @entity11 , who expected to play a major role in the repair effort			0
@entity75 representative @entity134 , whose @entity77 district includes the shipyard , blamed the submarine 's loss on @entity18 ' inability to come up with a budget			1
‘ it 's outrageous that the yard wo n't get the chance to put the @entity3 back in service because of sequestration , ’ she said			0
farewell : it took 12 hours and 100 firefighters to stop the blaze at @entity149 in @entity46			0
the sub will now be inactivated			0
