a close - up of her eye area is pictured @entity26 's body was preserved when it sank into mud which later froze			2

professor @entity102 , a mammoth researcher at the @entity6 , said : ' it 's an honour to be showcasing the world 's best preserved mammoth for the first time in western @entity49			0
' @entity9 is hugely important for helping us to understand the lives of ice age animals			0

woolly mammoths finally died out in eastern @entity2 around 4,000 years ago			1
@entity136 , vice president of the @entity19 @entity137 , said : ‘ the data we are about to receive will give us a high chance to clone the mammoth			0
’ but he called for responsibility in bringing the ancient beast back to life , urging that competing teams seeking to win a race to clone the mammoth , not to play @entity148 for the sake of it			0
‘ we must have a reason to do this , as it is one thing to clone it for scientific purpose and another to clone for the sake of curiosity , ’ he said			0
a cloning attempt would involve a female elephant – the closest living relative of the mammoth - acting as a surrogate mother .			0
