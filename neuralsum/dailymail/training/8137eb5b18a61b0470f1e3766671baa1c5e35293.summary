the president of the @entity1 has come under fierce scrutiny today after leaked documents show hundreds of firms used @entity6 tax avoidance deals while he was in charge of the country			1
@entity10 's previous pledge to bring some ' ethics ' to @entity13 's tax laws is now in doubt after the documents showed more than 300 companies such as @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22 were among those to channel funds through the tiny @entity13 nation using complex financial structures			1
the @entity1 said it was already probing the country ’s tax practices with a review of @entity29 , and would widen this inquiry in the light of new evidence			0
the leaked papers relate to 340 companies , including @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 and @entity22			1
it comes just days after mr @entity10 declared he was ' not frightened ' of facing down @entity41 prime minister @entity40 in the latest salvo of what is becoming an increasingly public spat over @entity41 's @entity46 tax bill			1
the so - called ' @entity48 ' documents show that billions of dollars were funneled through @entity6 , much of it during mr @entity10 's time in charge , thanks to financial structures that allowed companies to slash their tax liabilities , depriving hard - up governments around the world of revenue			1
@entity1 president @entity10 ( pictured ) presided over @entity6 while many of the tax avoidance schemes were operating mr @entity10 presided over the tax affairs of @entity6 for over two decades , transforming the country from a sleepy @entity13 backwater to a prized destination where hundreds of the world 's biggest companies channel their affairs			1
the leaks threaten to undermine his vow to be a more politically involved head of the @entity1 , the @entity46 's financial enforcer , especially as he is already embroiled in bitter rows with @entity40 and @entity73 over their budgets			2
on wednesday , asked about the tax policies he once led , mr @entity10 said he ' had his ideas ' about the matter but would keep them to himself do nothing to affect the @entity46 's investigation			1
the arrangements – used by hundreds of top companies - were signed off by the @entity46 state and are all legal			1
' these revelations are a major blow to the credibility of new commission president @entity10 and his capacity to act for the public interest , ' said @entity88 , of the @entity89 in the @entity90			1
mr @entity10 's spokesman said the veteran politician was ' serene ' about the revelations , though he pulled out of a public speaking engagement with former commission chief @entity95 scheduled later today			0
under an hour - long barrage of questions from reporters , the spokesman stressed that @entity46 regulators were already investigating whether @entity6 's deals with @entity102 internet giant @entity29 and the financial arm of @entity73 carmaker @entity104 amounted to illegal state aid			1
spokesman @entity106 said that if the @entity46 found it was in breach of the rules ' @entity6 will have to take corrective actions '			2
he added that the @entity46 could widen the probe to companies mentioned in the @entity113 investigation			0
scheme : some of the world 's largest firms including top @entity41 companies like @entity19 are using a @entity6 tax avoidance scheme ' like a magical fairyland ' to get out of paying billions of pounds the leaked tax papers , analysed by the @entity102 - based @entity121 ( @entity113 ) in a six month investigation , totall nearly 28,000 pages connected to more than 1,000 firms			1
mr @entity40 and mr @entity10 have been engaged in a bitter dispute in recent weeks as mr @entity40 battles to reduce the £ 1.7billion surcharge demanded by the @entity46 to cover years of strong economic growth in the @entity41 while @entity13 struggled			1
the @entity1 president said he was ‘ not the type who trembles in front of prime ministers ’ and warned mr @entity40 that he had ‘ a problem ’ with other @entity46 leaders			1
the prime minister was stung last month after the budget demand was leaked during a @entity139 summit			0
he has vowed not to pay ‘ anything like ’ the £ 1.7billion being demanded by @entity139 by december 1			0
but the revelations are predicted to trigger more calls for politicians to work harder to stop firms taking advantage of international tax rules avoid their tax bills			1
the @entity148 reported last night that @entity19 had set up companies in the @entity150 and @entity6 to put £ 300m of internal loans into its @entity41 operations in 2011			1
the interest payments made on the loans were taxed at only around one per cent in @entity6 – saving the firm millions			1
the newspaper also said drugs firm @entity156 and city trading company @entity155 had also cut their tax bills with help from @entity6			1
the @entity148 said the leaked papers showed ' @entity6 was acting as a go - between , both enabling and masking tax avoidance , which always takes place beyond its borders '			1
president : the new president of the @entity1 , @entity10 ( pictured ) - a former @entity6 prime minister - has insisted the country is not a tax haven in its investigation , the @entity113 said global accounting giant @entity168 had helped multinationals in question secure at least 548 tax rulings in @entity6 between 2002 and 2010			1
the documents uncovered details of so - called @entity174 - pre-negotiated deals which set out how companies will be taxed , the same practice that the @entity46 is investigating in the @entity29 and @entity104 cases			2
' it 's like taking your tax plan to the government and getting it blessed ahead of time , ' the @entity113 quoted @entity187 tax expert @entity185 as saying			0
the @entity46 has no power over member states ' tax affairs as such , but it can probe whether they amount to illegal state aid , which breaches the 28 - nation bloc 's single market rules			2
similar cases have been opened against @entity196 for tax deals with tech giant @entity36 and the @entity198 with coffee chain @entity199			0
the @entity113 said its investigation had involved a team of more than 80 journalists from 26 countries working for outlets including @entity148 , @entity205 and @entity207 's @entity206			0
the @entity148 acknowledged in its report of the investigation that the @entity6 arrangements were ' perfectly legal ' but noted that they were enabling tax avoidance on ' an industrial scale '			1
other companies that benefited from the schemes included @entity17 , @entity38 , @entity18 , @entity215 and @entity216			0
the @entity113 said some companies had been able to achieve effective tax rates of less than one percent on profits channelled through @entity6			2
@entity220 , a @entity221 professor who has held senior tax roles in the @entity223 , said : ' clearly the database is evidencing a pervasive enabling by @entity6 of multinationals ' avoidance of taxes [ around the world ]			2
' he described @entity6 as being ' like a magical fairyland			0
' it comes as only last week prime minister @entity40 told business leaders he would not tolerate large multinational firms avoiding tax			2
cracking down : last week prime minister @entity40 told business leaders he would not tolerate large multinational firms avoiding tax mr @entity40 said : ' we 've cut the rate of corporation tax down to 20 per cent , we 're the most competitive place to come and start a business , but here 's the deal – if they have a low tax rate , those companies have damn well got to pay it			1
' and @entity247 is next month expected to announce new measures to stop such businesses diverting its money offshore			0
@entity10 this summer pledged to ' try to put some morality , some ethics , into the @entity13 tax landscape '			0
he has also insisted the country was not a tax haven , @entity148 reported			0
the newspaper said the findings were put to @entity156 , @entity155 and @entity19 but all three declined to answer questions and instead issued statements saying they do not engage in tax avoidance and they pay tax in the countries where profits are made			2
it was also reported last night that a joint venture between the @entity267 and private equity group @entity268 in 2008 also used a @entity6 structure when it invested in magazine and events group @entity272 , now @entity273			0
a spokesman for @entity267 said : ' we partnered with a private equity company which regularly used such structures			0
a @entity6 entity was used because @entity268 already had that structure in place			0
the fact that the parent company is a @entity6 company does not give rise to any @entity41 corporation tax savings for @entity267			2
' executives including @entity286 , the former chief executive of @entity287 's , have appeared to defend the multinationals			0
mr @entity286 , who left the supermarket giant in july , said the situation was ' not black and white ' and that , if people did not like the tax methods used by a particular firm , they should shop elsewhere			0
he said : ' they are not loopholes			0
they are legitimate tax systems put in place by legitimate governments legitimately elected			0
taxing question : last month , it emerged that @entity302 had not paid any corporation tax in the @entity41 for a second year in a row , despite recording sales of £ 50million ' it is wrong to lay that at the door of companies operating their business in a structure … constructed by government			2
' the first thing you have got to do is hold governments to account for putting those structures in place ; that we have seen in @entity196			0
' the @entity196 have come to the conclusion that the ' double irish ' is not acceptable in their own parliament			0
' last month , it emerged that @entity302 had not paid any corporation tax in the @entity41 for a second year in a row , despite recording sales of £ 50million , after pushing much of its revenues through a complex scheme in @entity196 .			2
