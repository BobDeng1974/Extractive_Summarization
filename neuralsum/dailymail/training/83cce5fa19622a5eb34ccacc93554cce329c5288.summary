the technique is all the rage at the chic dermatology clinics that cater to legions of wealthy women here who invest serious time and big bucks into looking their bikini best			0
but @entity6 is n't a socialite , nor did she fork out the $ 450 that a single radio - frequency session typically runs in @entity22			1
the struggling housewife got the treatment free of charge at a clinic that provides the poor access to the kinds of pricey cosmetic treatments that have become almost de rigueur among @entity30 's moneyed elite			1
fair : @entity32 receives a free of charge radio - frequency treatment by dr. @entity35 , right , at the @entity30 society of @entity38 clinic in @entity22 , @entity30 free botox and laser hair removal , free chemical peels and anti-cellulite treatments may at first seem shockingly frivolous in a country like @entity30 — which , despite phenomenal economic growth in recent years that has lifted millions out of extreme poverty , still battles with diseases like tuberculosis and dengue			1
but the philosophy behind the more than 220 clinics across @entity30 that treat people like @entity6 and thousands of maids , receptionists , waitresses and others is simple : beauty is a right , and the poor deserve to be ravishing , too			1
the @entity30 society of @entity38 's @entity22 clinic has performed free procedures on more than 14,000 patients since its founding in 1997 , said dr. @entity63 , who heads the @entity22 branch			1
good looks , doctors argue , are more than skin deep , and by treating what patients view as physical flaws doctors are often also healing their psyches			2
' what 's a wrinkle ? something minor , right ? something with precious little importance , ' @entity63 said			2
' but when we treat the wrinkle , that unimportant little thing , we 're actually treating something very important : the patient 's self esteem			2
' the notion that beauty treatments can act in much the same way as psychoanalysis , helping free patients from crippling neuroses , was pioneered over the past decades by celebrated @entity30 plastic surgeon @entity88			1
free of charge : doctors perform an abdominoplasty surgery at the @entity93 hospital in @entity22 , @entity30 on march 21			1
the hospital focuses on reconstructive operations for burn victims and people with serious deformations , but it also provides discounted cosmetic procedures nicknamed the ' philosopher of plastic surgery ' for his intellectual and psychoanalytical take on the vocation , 85 - year - old @entity88 is largely responsible for @entity30 's reputation as a world leader in the field and a top destination for cosmetic surgery tourism			1
his skill with the scalpel catapulted him to international fame — the surgeon is arguably @entity30 's second most famous person after soccer legend @entity113			1
it 's made him the go - to man for a-list celebrities , international statesmen and royalty seeking a quick fix to their aesthetic woes			0
@entity88 's long and illustrious patient roster is said to include such luminaries as @entity124 , @entity125 and @entity126 , although the discreet doctor has rarely named names			0
@entity88 's handicraft on the world 's rich and famous allowed him to join their ranks — he commutes to @entity22 by helicopter from his own private island			1
but he has remained attentive to the less privileged			0
more than half a century ago , he founded a surgical wing to help treat the poor			0
while the wing at the @entity93 hospital in @entity22 focuses on reconstructive operations for burn victims and people with serious deformations , it also provides discounted cosmetic procedures			1
other hospitals have since followed suit			0
now , at least two dozen mostly public hospitals in @entity22 alone offer discounted or sometimes free cosmetic surgeries to low income people , according to a website aimed at informing potential patients			1

at least two dozen , mostly public hospitals in @entity22 alone offer discounted or sometimes free cosmetic surgeries to low income people with more than 11.5 million operations a year , @entity30 is the world 's second biggest consumer of plastic surgery after the @entity165 , but here there 's none of the kind of stigma that still clings to the practice in the @entity165 local celebrities appear on the cover of glossy magazines with titles like ' plastica e @entity175 , ' or ' @entity176 , ' and wax poetic about their latest face - lift , breast implant , or round of @entity181			1
actors on the prime time soap operas that captivate the public here regularly get surgical makeovers , as do the characters they play as part of the soaps ' high - drama story lines			0
@entity194 , on prominent display at the beach all year round , takes center stage during @entity196 , when samba queens wearing only a sprinkling of sequins and feathers flaunt their pumped - up bustlines and gravity - defying rear ends at @entity22 's extravagant @entity204 parade			1
( @entity205 and buttock implants are among the most popular plastic surgeries here , along with liposuction , facelifts and procedures to flatten prominent ears )			2
the senate is currently debating whether the government 's national health service should fully cover breast reconstruction for cancer patients			2
the state - funded health service already pays for gastroplasties for the morbidly obese and some surgeries to repair serious deformities or injuries , including correcting cleft palates in children			0
' in @entity30 , plastic surgery is now seen as something of the norm , ' said @entity229 , an anthropology professor at the @entity230 and author of @entity232 : @entity233 in @entity30			1
' in a way , surgery is becoming the standard of care among middle class and wealthy women , and so it 's not surprising that lower class people aspire to it , too			2
' surgery : @entity6 receives a free of charge radio - frequency treatment on her abdomen by doctor @entity63 , at the @entity30 society of @entity38 clinic in @entity22 , @entity30 while he acknowledges the potent psychological benefits that sometimes result from plastic surgery , @entity249 warns that @entity30 's overwhelmingly pro-plastica attitude can be dangerous			1
' the word beauty in @entity30 kind of obscures the fact that you 're talking about real surgery , ' he said			1
' the problems and risks of surgery are often minimized , and these operations tend to be seen like a ' beautification ' like any other , which of course they 're not			0
' still , worries about risk do n't appear to be holding many here back			0
on the few days a year when low - income people can apply for free or cut - rate cosmetic surgeries , the lines snake out and around the hospitals			0
once their case has been approved , patients often spend months or even years on the waiting list ahead of the actual surgery			2
the free surgeries are widely seen to benefit the hospitals , too , as they allow young doctors to hone their skills			0
@entity32 said she waited three years for her first free laser treatment there			0
though the clinic , which is also a private training institute for doctors , does n't perform surgical procedures that require anything more than local anesthetic , @entity32 says she 's experienced the kinds of psychological benefits described by superstar surgeon @entity88			1
' since i was a teenager , i had lots of horrible hairs on my chin and i tried everything to get rid of them but nothing worked , ' said @entity32 , a 48 - year - old secretary whose entire monthly salary is less than a single laser hair removal treatment session			0
' i had heard that lasers were effective but they 're so expensive , they seemed like an impossible dream for me			0
' six free laser hair removal sessions later , @entity32 's chin is silky smooth and she says she 's a new woman			2
' i never knew what it was to look into the mirror and like what i saw , ' she said			0
' it 's an amazing feeling			0
