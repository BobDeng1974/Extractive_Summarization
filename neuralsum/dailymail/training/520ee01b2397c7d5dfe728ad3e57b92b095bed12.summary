a student has privately prosecuted the man who harassed him after filming evidence of the abuse on a video camera hidden inside a pair of sunglasses			1
@entity7 , who lives in @entity8 , bought the surveillance glasses in a bid to document the abuse he was suffering at the hands of his tormentor			1
the 20 - year - old student says he complained repeatedly to the police about insults and intimidation he suffered from the man			1
@entity7 , 20 , from @entity8 , mounted a private prosecution against his tormentor by using footage which he obtained through his surveillance sunglasses ( file pic of @entity22 ) he claims he called officers over the incident five to ten times but no action was taken			1
so mr @entity7 , a student at @entity27 , decided to take matters into his own hands			2
he bought a pair of sunglasses - similar to @entity22 - which contain a covert video recorder in the frame			1
he then went about collating evidence which could be used against the man in court			2
once he had evidence of the man swearing at him on camera , mr @entity7 brought his own charge against the man under the @entity41			1
the landmark case - believed to be one of the first of its kind - may lead to more private prosecutions of this kind			0
the defendant , who can not be named for legal reasons , pleaded guilty at @entity51			1
mr @entity7 alleged the defendant 's conduct involved ' threatening , abusive and insulting words or behaviour ' which caused him ' harassment , alarm or distress '			1
as the defendant pleaded guilty , the way in which the video evidence was obtained was never scrutinised			1
he spent one day in prison , after being given the option by magistrates of paying a £ 500 fine or spending the day in custody			1
mr @entity7 told @entity66 : ' it was like having a camera between your eyes			2
' after mr @entity7 contacted a lawyer for advice , a lawyer for the defendant wrote to the @entity74 asking it to take over the case , according to the paper			1
the defendant pleaded guilty at @entity51 ( pictured ) to the harassment offence the @entity74 wrote back saying there was a realistic prospect of conviction but decided not to intervene			1
it said it was satisfied that both sides were represented and there was no need for an independent prosecutor			2
@entity88 , a solicitor with the @entity90 law firm @entity89 , who gave @entity7 advice about the case , told the paper : ' this is very rare			2
this is the first time we have done a case like this			0
' if it was the @entity74 themselves doing it , it might have cost them a lot of time on a not very serious case			2
' a @entity74 spokesperson said : ' we decided that there was no need for the @entity74 to take over this prosecution and therefore the private prosecution should be left to continue			1
' earlier this year , @entity22 went on sale in the @entity112 , costing around £ 1,000			0
similar to a pair of spectacles , the hands - free device is equipped with an optical display which shows digital information and allows users to access apps using voice commands and movement			0
@entity123 has contacted @entity124 for comment			0
the right to bring a private prosecution dates back to the earliest days of the legal system			0
under @entity112 law , anyone has the right to bring a private prosecution in front of the criminal courts			0
cases have historically been rare due to the high costs involved in investigating and pursuing such cases			0
legal aid is not available for private prosecutions , meaning they have to be paid for by the alleged victim			0
there are a number of organisations that regularly prosecute cases before the courts but do so as private individuals , using the right of any individual to bring a private prosecution			0
one example is the @entity150			0
according to @entity74 guidance , there is nothing wrong in allowing a private prosecution to run its course through to verdict and sentence			1
there is no requirement for the @entity74 to take over a private prosecution			1
the fact that a private prosecution succeeds is not an indication that the case should have been prosecuted by the @entity74 , it says			2
however , the @entity166 ( @entity167 ) has the power to take over private prosecutions and there will be times when the @entity74 will exercise this power			0
there has been a growing trend towards private prosecutions in the past few years , raising concerns about a divided justice system , which could only allow private companies or wealthy individuals to seek justice			0
the most high - profile private prosecution was by the family of @entity183 in 1996			0
it was made against five suspects - only three of whom made it to trial - after three years of failed police investigations			0
all the defendants were acquitted on the orders of the judge .			0

@entity7 , from @entity8 , complained to police about being *bullied*
the 20 - year - old bought surveillance sunglasses to record evidence of abuse
using footage , he took tormentor to court under a harassment charge
@entity74 said it would not take on prosecution as both sides were represented
defendant pleaded guilty to the charge and spent one day in custody
