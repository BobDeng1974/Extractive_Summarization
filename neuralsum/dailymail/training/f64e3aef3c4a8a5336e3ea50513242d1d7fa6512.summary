by @entity0 published : 12:11 est , 9 july 2013 updated : 12:17 est , 9 july 2013 designers in @entity2 have invented an @entity4 docking station that doubles up as a smoke and gas alarm - and they claim it can be more effective than the traditional ceiling - mounted alarms			1
the sense + dock has built - in sensors that detect smoke from fires as well as carbon monoxide			1
when these sensors detect the life - threatening gases an app is launched on the docked @entity4 and a loud alarm will ring			2
when the built - in sensors detect smoke or carbon monoxide , an app on the docked phone will open and an alarm will ring			1
the sense + can then automatically call a list of customisable emergency numbers the sense + docking station has a built - in photoelectric sensor			1
this sensor , also known as a photo eye is used to detect the distance , absence , or presence of an object by using a light transmitter , often infrared , and a photoelectric receiver			0
the sense + 's photoelectric alarm aims a light source into a sensing chamber at an angle away from the sensor			1
smoke enters the chamber , reflecting light onto the light sensor and this triggers the alarm			0
if this alarm is not manually turned off within 30 seconds , a list of emergency phone numbers is displayed on the @entity4 's screen before the system begins automatically calling these numbers for help			1
the user can also shut down the app or decline from making emergency calls			0
these emergency numbers can be customised and the app will only call the numbers added to the @entity70 - it ca n't access the user 's phone book			2
the sense + uses a ' photoelectric ' sensor that can detect cold smoke which some traditional smoke alarms have difficulty sensing			1
this is combined with a carbon monoxide sensor			1
the designers claim that in certain situations the sense + could be more effective at alerting the user to a fire or dangerous gases than wall and ceiling - mounted sensors			1
however , instead of replacing them , the inventors designed the sense + to work with the existing alarms to increase protection			2
the majority of ceiling - mounted smoke detectors rely on ionisation smoke detection and respond more effectively to smoke caused by flaming fires			0
the sense + , pictured , uses a photoelectric sensor that detects cold smoke which some traditional alarms have difficulty sensing			1
this is combined with a carbon monoxide sensor			2
the designers claim that in certain situations the sense + is more effective at detecting dangerous chemicals than ceiling - mounted sensors the sense + 's photoelectric smoke sensor is more effective at detecting smouldering fires			1
this photoelectric alarm aims a light source into a sensing chamber at an angle away from the sensor			0
when smoke enters the chamber it reflects light onto the light sensor and this triggers the alarm			0
the sense + device is designed by company @entity124 based in @entity2 and costs Â£ 65			2
the design team developed the @entity122 + after looking at deaths caused by smoke inhalation in houses in developing countries			0
they discovered that many of these households did not have smoke alarms yet they did have the latest smartphones			0
this led them to create the sense + as a flexible personal alarm that works as a backup detector and a device that helps quickly when needed			1
the current version has been designed specifically for the @entity4 yet it also supports the connection of other smart devices through a usb port			0
the makers also have future versions planned for @entity149 and @entity150 smartphones			0
@entity151 , spokesman for sense + , said : ' sense + is an emergency aid solution consisting of an app and a charging dock			2
' it uses the latest smoke and carbon monoxide detectors to detect cold smoke and automatically take action for you in case of an alarm			1
the current version of @entity122 + has been designed specifically for the @entity4 yet it also supports the connection of other smart devices through a usb port			0
it was designed by @entity124 in @entity2 and the makers have future versions planned for @entity149 and @entity150 smartphones ' the thinking behind it was to potentially save lives			0
' it uses photoelectric technology smoke sensors because it is best for detecting smoke which is the major killer in house fires			0
' it also uses carbon monoxide detectors			2
as invisible , odorless and tasteless , carbon monoxide is a very poisonous gas that can kill quickly and without warning			0
' the combination of the two detectors is very powerful especially in situations like caravanning , boating , camping , and travelling			0
' we tested the sense + against a group of off - the - shelf ceiling type sensors and with the smoke testing the sense + always outperformed the photo voltaic models			1
' but when the sense + was at bedside height , the off - the - shelf models at ceiling height went off quicker			2

sense + detector is an @entity4 docking station with a built - in smoke sensor
when the sensor detects smoke or carbon monoxide an alarm is triggered
if the alarm is n't turned off manually the sense + makes an emergency call
