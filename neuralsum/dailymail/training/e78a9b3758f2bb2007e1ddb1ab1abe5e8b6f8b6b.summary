by @entity0 published : 18:04 est , 6 december 2012 updated : 07:11 est , 7 december 2012 the loving wife of a desperately ill musician yesterday won her fight to force a hospital to keep treating him			2
doctors had wanted to withhold potentially lifesaving care from @entity8 , 68			1
but a senior judge overruled them , saying they had failed to fully credit the importance of his ‘ continued existence ’			0
' continued existence ' : @entity8 , 68 , will continue to receive care after a senior judge ruled that doctors had undervalued the limited quality of life mr @entity8 could still enjoy sitting at the @entity20 , mr @entity19 said the doctors had undervalued the limited quality of life mr @entity8 could still enjoy			1
he described the patient ’s relationship with his family as ‘ of the closest and most meaningful kind ’ and this carried ‘ great weight ’ in his decision			1
in emotional evidence , relatives had insisted mr @entity8 smiled when they visited and enjoyed reading the newspaper , listening to music and seeing his grandchildren			1
the landmark ruling means hospitals will have to pay greater attention to the wishes of families seeking continued treatment against medical advice			0
mr @entity8 walked into hospital seven months ago with a stomach complaint , but contracted pneumonia that led to multiple organ failure			1
he has been kept alive despite suffering a stroke , a heart attack and kidney problems that have left him unable to speak or to breathe unaided			0
earlier this week , the hospital treating him launched a legal bid to refuse ‘ aggressive ’ treatment – including restarting his heart – if he deteriorated further			2
it said the potential suffering outweighed the tiny chances of recovery			0
but his family opposed the hospital in court – accusing doctors of placing mr @entity8 on the controversial @entity59 for end - of - life care to free up his intensive care bed			1
mr @entity19 found for the relatives , saying that while mr @entity8 ’s position was ‘ grim ’ , the proposed treatment was not ‘ futile or overly burdensome ’ – as doctors claimed			1
‘ although the burdens of treatment are very great indeed , they have to be weighed against the benefits of a continued existence , ’ he concluded			0
he said while there was next to no chance mr @entity8 would ever leave hospital and resume his musical career , that did not mean there was ‘ no prospect of recovery ’			1
‘ recovery does not mean a return to full health , but the resumption of a quality of life that @entity8 would regard as worthwhile , ’ he said			2
to insist otherwise ‘ set the standard unduly high ’			0
loving wife mrs may @entity87 , left , with her daughter @entity88			0
mrs @entity87 yesterday won her fight to force a hospital to keep treating him mr @entity8 ’s daughter @entity88 , 48 , said : ‘ i feel absolutely overwhelmed			1
it just proves what the hospital has been trying to do is unlawful			0
it ’s disgusting that we should have had to come to court in the first place			0
‘ it ’s been a terrible time for us all , but the people i feel most sorry for now are the patients who do n’t have families to fight for them like my dad has			0
‘ to be brutally honest i think it all comes down to costs – he ’s been there for seven months , he ’s become a liability and they want to free up a bed			0
‘ but the judge agreed with us , and hopefully it will stop other families having to go through what we have			0
’ mr @entity8 , a well - known guitarist in his native @entity59 , who played on the 1974 hit @entity116 by @entity117 , overcame bowel cancer ten years ago			2
but in may he was admitted to the hospital – which can not be named for legal reasons – with constipation , initially seeming to be doing well , the court heard			0
however later that month he became critically ill after contracting hospital - acquired pneumonia and was moved to intensive care			0
mr @entity8 , pictured earlier this year , walked into hospital seven months ago with a stomach complaint , but got pneumonia that led to multiple organ failure			1
judge @entity19 , right , overruled doctors yesterday doctors warned his family he was unlikely to survive , and over the next few weeks he sustained brain damage from a stroke and became dependent on a ventilator			1
mr @entity8 has also suffered a heart attack and near - kidney failure as well as contracting repeated infections , but each time bounced back			1
he can no longer speak and although his family believe they can lip - read words that he mouths he has been unable to express his wishes over further treatment			0
the hospital trust applied for a court order stating that it would be lawful for them to withhold three types of potentially lifesaving treatment if his condition were to deteriorate further			1
the three were : invasive support for chronic low blood pressure – treatment the hospital claimed was painful and distressing ; renal replacement therapy – a form of kidney dialysis that can leave patients shivering uncontrollably for hours ; cardiopulmonary resuscitation – chest compressions to restart his heart which could fracture his ribs			1
the court heard that if the judge agreed to this course , mr @entity8 would eventually suffer further infections which would cause him to slip into a coma and die			1
an independent intensive care consultant who examined mr @entity8 for the @entity171 , who is acting on his behalf independently of his family , backed the hospital ’s argument that he is in distress			1
@entity175 concluded mr @entity8 was only ‘ minimally conscious ’ and gave a less than 1 per cent chance of recovery			2
may , his 67 - year - old wife of 50 years , told the court that when he overcame bowel cancer a decade earlier , his attitude was ‘ this is n’t going to beat me ’ and she was convinced he still felt the same way			0
yesterday the @entity171 ’s barrister , @entity183 , said that while mr @entity8 derived some limited pleasure from life , to provide the treatment the hospital wanted to withhold would be disproportionate given the minimal good it would do			1
but @entity188 , for mrs @entity87 and her daughter , pointed out he enjoyed visits and appeared to retain his sense of humour			0
she said the family accepted there may come a time when it would be hopeless to keep trying to save him , but that point had not yet been reached			0
‘ it may be that there is n’t a joyous outcome , but surely what mr @entity8 does deserve is time , ’ she concluded			2
rejecting the hospital ’s application , the judge stressed that exactly how to treat mr @entity8 in future remained a matter for the doctors to decide			1
‘ if there is another crisis , the doctors and the family will have to try to reach a common view , ’ he said			0
‘ it may be that this will involve treatment of one kind or another ; it may be that the family will agree that mr @entity8 has had enough			1
’ he paid tribute to the skill of the medical professionals treating mr @entity8 and accepted that they had not put him on the @entity59			2
@entity224 , representing the trust , applied for permission to appeal , but mr @entity19 refused , saying it would need to apply to the @entity228			0
afterwards a trust spokesman said : ‘ our critical care teams continue to give mr @entity8 dedicated , specialist care to meet his clinical needs			2
we will review the judgement and decide on the appropriate next steps for mr @entity8 ’s care			2
