the stunning revelation came ten days after a @entity13 @entity12 congressman spilled the beans with a public but little - noticed claim that there were 40 such ' foreign fighter ' jihadis back on @entity4 soil			1
in a gathering with selected journalists , the administration official acknowledged that it 's true			1
the @entity24 's latest determination , the official said , ' includes those who 've gone , those who 've tried to go , some who 've come back and are under active – the @entity9 is looking at them			2
' i refer you to them on specifics			0
' the revelation marks the @entity1 administration 's first confirmation of what rep. @entity37 said sept. 12 when he described to a @entity59 audience how as many as 40 @entity4 have returned to the @entity4 after fighting for the @entity6 terror army overseas			1
he said also that the @entity9 already has all of them all under surveillance			0
' one of the concerns is the number of @entity4 citizens who have left our country to go join up with @entity6 , ' he told the @entity38 , a regional economic development organization			1
' it is believed there have been some number up to 100 that have done that			2
' ' it is also believed that some 40 of those who left this country to join up with @entity6 have now returned to our country			1
those 40 are under @entity9 attention and surveillance			0
so they are known and they are being tracked by the @entity9			0
' ' @entity6 ' refers to the self - declared @entity6 , a murderous terror army that has left a wake of death , destruction , kidnapping and rape as it conquered more than one - third of @entity87 and @entity88			1
@entity30 , the @entity89 , said monday during his regular press briefing that he could n't comment on what would by definition be ' relatively sensitive intelligence information			0
' but he did say that the @entity4 is ' working very closely with our international partners to try to mitigate this threat , to keep eyes on these individuals and to monitor their movements			1
' ' we 've also been working closely with @entity100 ... to track the movements of these individuals , ' @entity30 said			0
' so this is an inter-agency response to a significant threat that we 're watching closely			0
' the official who spoke monday said the @entity24 now estimates that 15,000 militants from 80 countries have at least made attempts to fight for @entity110 groups in @entity87 and @entity88			1
that number includes 100 americans and another 2,000 from @entity113			0

@entity123 ( right ) is listed among the september 2013 attackers on the @entity125 in @entity126 , @entity127 @entity4 : @entity128 ( left ) was killed in @entity129 , the capital of @entity116 , in july 2009 while fighting with an @entity110 group			2

@entity135 ( right ) remains at large after being indicted for aiding a terrorist group in 2010 an @entity6 leader told followers on monday that they should execute lone - wolf attacks in the @entity4 and @entity140 because those two nations are the ones that have been flying bombing sorties against the group in @entity87			1
@entity145 reported that an @entity6 spokesman issued a call to ' hinder those who want to harm your brothers			2
the best thing you can do is to strive to your best and kill any disbeliever , whether he be @entity140 , @entity4 or from any of their allies			1
' ' civilians should not be exempt from brutality , ' he said			1
' do not ask for anyone 's advice and do not seek anyone 's verdict			0
kill the disbeliever whether he is civilian or military , for they have the same ruling			0
both of them are disbelievers			0
both of them are considered to be waging war			0
' @entity6 can now muster 31,000 troops overall , the @entity174 reported on sept. 17			2
that number has grown dramatically since june 29 , when @entity6 declared itself a ' caliphate ' – an @entity6 nation led by a supreme religious authority			2
@entity4 jihadis , part of a swelling ' foreign fighter ' contingent aiding @entity6 and other terror networks , could put their ideologies and experience to work in the @entity4 , a fact that has some in @entity189 clamoring for easier ways to revoke their citizenship			1
the @entity40 said two weeks ago that only about a dozen @entity4 had left the country to join up with @entity6 , while as many as 100 are suspected of taking up arms with a wider range of @entity110 extremist groups in the @entity196 and @entity197			1
foreign fighters : as many as 12,000 soldiers in the 31,000 - man @entity6 terror army have traveled into @entity88 or @entity87 to join the @entity110 group in battle @entity37 , the member of @entity189 who first discussed the size of the @entity4 > foreign - fighter problem publicly , insisted that they do n't pose a serious threat			1
' at the present time , ' he told his sept. 12 audience , ' the intelligence is @entity6 does not present a threat to the homeland , although that is not something that will remain static going out into the future			2
' ' but there is a concern , ' @entity37 allowed , ' that it could metastasize in such a way that it could become a threat to the homeland			0
' @entity37 backed president @entity1 's approach to defeating the terrorist would - be country , which he said ' is a very , very complex and very , very dangerous threat			1
' referring to remarks @entity1 delivered on sept , 10 , he said , ' i think the plan that the president outlined the other night [ in his national speech ] is a good plan			2
' the president ' is correct to recognize the threat , and it clearly is a threat to the stability of the @entity196 , a region that is already remarkably unstable			0
' on thursday , @entity231 thwarted legislation that would have revoked the citizenship of @entity4 who swear allegiance to terror groups that threaten the @entity4			1
