meanwhile , just a day after the gaffe - prone @entity150 got himself stuck on a zip - wire , he decided to do his bit for @entity70 - @entity8 relations , with similarly embarrassing results			2
as the two countries prepared for their delicate talks , the mayor of @entity9 instead challenged @entity8 leader @entity5 to ' strip to the waist ' and take part in the judo contest			1
