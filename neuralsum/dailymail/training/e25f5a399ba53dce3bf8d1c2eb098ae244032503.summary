it has raked in a staggering £ 800,000 in fines in just six months and flashes an average of 71 motorists every single day - making this speed camera in @entity5 every driver 's worst nightmare			1
the device , located on @entity9 in the @entity11 capital , has become the most lucrative speed camera in the @entity13 and has already caught an astonishing 13,624 drivers this year			1
the shady title was previously held by a camera at @entity17 on the @entity18 in @entity19 which caught 26 speeding drivers per day			1
the data comes from research conducted by @entity32 insurance , who have also revealed that in 2013 speed cameras cost @entity13 motorists £ 22million in fines			1
the new speed trap on a busy junction in @entity5 was at the centre of a storm yesterday - with drivers calling it ' nothing but a cash cow '			1
motorists have been left angered by the speed camera after road chiefs hailed it a massive success			0
mother - of - three @entity50 , who was caught going at 34mph through the speed trap , said : ' it 's is ridiculous - i 've been driving on that road every days for years without any problem whatsoever until this camera was put up			1
' it is nothing but a cash cow			1
it 's outrageous , the camera does nothing to improve safety of this road			1
it may be a busy stretch but it 's perfectly safe			1
driving trap : the device , which catches an average of 71 motorists every day , has been met with outrage by drivers who claim that it does nothing to improve the safety of the road ' i did n't notice the camera going up , i got caught doing 34mph and i had to pay £ 85 for a speed awareness course			1
' it was a complete waste of my time and money - i 'm sure that most of the other 13,000 people would tell you exactly the same thing			0
' the camera has been in place since 2012 but it has only just became ' fully commissioned ' catching thousands of motorists in the first six months of this year			2
according to the latest statistics , the cameras generated 13,624 penalty notices for speeding and 146 for red - light offences			0
and in february there were more than 100 tickets issued , on average , each day			0
@entity13 's worst : the camera has taken the title of ' @entity13 's most lucrative speed camera ' after its activity was monitored for six months - the previous holder was located on junction 25 of the @entity18 in @entity19 in the first half of the year 5,906 people completed speed awareness courses after being caught speeding at the junction			1
a further 3,064 people paid speeding fines in the same six months			2
figures show that with a minimum fine of £ 100 and a typical cost of £ 85 per place on speed awareness courses , the camera could have netted an astonishing £ 808,410			0
research by @entity32 insurance has revealed that a speed camera installed on @entity9 in @entity5 has detected 13 , 624 speeding drivers this year and raked in a staggering £ 800,000 in fines in six months			1
here are three other prolific @entity13 speed cameras : the @entity117 partnership , which operates @entity11 ' road safety cameras , say the area has a high flow of traffic and motorists should always comply with the speed limit			2
but road safety groups have said the camera is not doing it 's job properly and should be there to reduce speeds rather than bring in money			2
@entity130 , from the @entity131 , said : ' the whole purpose of speed cameras is to slow people down , because it 's felt that excessive speed in that area causes casualties			0
' if a camera is issuing a small number of fines , or none at all , it 's doing its job			2
if it 's ticketing that many people , it 's not having that effect			0
' the local authority , which is responsible for road safety , should be looking at those figures and saying , ' we seem to have an issue here - the camera is catching a lot of people			2
' let 's make sure that it looks like a 30mph highway , and that the cameras are clearly visible and the signs are n't obscured by vegetation '			0
' a spokesman for @entity5 council said : ' the speed camera in question does not have advance signs in place alerting drivers , as this is not a legal requirement			0
although this camera has been in place for some time , due to maintenance issues it has not been operational			0
@entity172 is alarmed at the number of tickets generated since the camera has been working and would urge drivers to reduce their speed for the safety of other road users , or face the consequences			0
@entity172 is committed to working with the @entity180 through the @entity181 and speed cameras have and will continue to play an important role to improve road safety for those using @entity5 ’s highways			0
a recent example is the 20mph zones which are operational in @entity189 and @entity190 to improve public safety , encourage walking and alternate forms of transport			0

@entity197 , on city 's @entity9 , only became fully operational at start of 2014
so far this year it has caught more than 13,000 speeding drivers
it catches three times as many people as @entity13 's former busiest camera
drivers call it ' outrageous cash cow ' claiming road was ' perfectly safe '
@entity32 insurance exposed device and claim @entity215 paid £ 22million in fines in 2013
