by @entity0 last updated at 9:33 am on 10th november 2011 as many a forecaster will cheerfully admit , predicting the weather is n’t an exact science			2
but the @entity4 is about to try to make it that little bit more precise with a new format			1
rather than telling us that rain , sun or snow will be ‘ likely ’ or ‘ very likely ’ , they will use percentages to describe the probabilities of what the weather could be			0
100 % chance of rain : hundreds of golf spectators huddle beneath their umbrellas at the @entity20 , @entity21 , in july this year so , for example , tomorrow ’s forecast could tell you there is a 45 per cent chance of rain			0
the @entity4 said the system would ‘ empower people to make their own decisions ’ based on the information available			1
but anyone who ’s ever been caught in an unexpected downpour may feel they have simply come up with a way to deflect blame when they get it wrong			0
in the @entity38 , forecasts often outline multiple scenarios for what could happen , so people have to make up their own minds as to whether to brave a day out , or stay home			1
yesterday the minister who oversees the @entity4 , @entity44 , told mps that an @entity38 - style system of percentages was the ‘ direction of travel ’			1
the system is being tested on a separate @entity4 website to gain public feedback , and is expected to be launched formally next year			1
the information on it includes ‘ probability of precipitation ’ – rain , sleet or snow – the percentage of humidity , wind speed and a uv level between one and ten indicating how strong the sun will be			0
@entity44 , who oversees the @entity4 , told mps that an @entity38 - style system of percentages was the ' direction of travel ' it also gives actual temperatures and what it ‘ feels like ’ taking into account these factors			1
consumer affairs minister mr @entity44 told the @entity75 : ‘ the @entity4 is working with a number of people to look at how best to get over those risks and probabilities			1
‘ we do know that other countries use percentages to try to get that over			0
on the website they are beginning to use a lot of probability data , fan charts and so forth , so this is the direction of travel			0
‘ but if we do move away from “ it is likely to rain ” or “ it is very likely to be foggy ” or the phrases we see and hear on our tv screens , we need to make sure where we end up is something the @entity97 public feel happy with and are able to use in their daily lives			2
’ @entity4 spokesman @entity100 said : ‘ it would mean the public can assess the likelihood of what they do			2
instead of us saying it is likely to rain , it will empower people to make their own decisions based on the best information we ’ve got			1
’ he said that broadcasters such as the @entity111 would have to decide whether or not to use the probabilities in their weather reports			0
in 2009 , the @entity4 came under fire for predicting a barbecue summer which turned out to be a washout , then months later was accused of failing to warn the public of the coldest winter for 30 years			2
as a result , it ditched its 90 - day seasonal forecasts .			0

@entity4 says it will ' empower people to make their own decisions '
