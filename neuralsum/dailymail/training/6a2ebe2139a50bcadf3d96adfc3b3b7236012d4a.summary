by @entity0 back surgery : @entity2 and @entity4 's chief fire officer @entity3 , used £ 3000 of taxpayer money for his back operation a fire chief who earns £ 122,000 - a - year has been criticised for spending £ 3,000 of taxpayers ’ money to fund a private back operation			1
@entity3 , 50 , the chief fire officer for @entity2 and @entity4 's @entity12 spent the money on surgery which took place at a private hospital in october last year and was part - funded by the taxpayer			1
since his operation he has received widespread support from the county 's fire authority which said that the money was ‘ well spent			1
’ but critics argue that the high - earning officer should not have used taxpayers ' money to sort out his private health problem			2
a freedom of information request revealed mr @entity3 had refused to have the routine surgery carried on the @entity30 after he was told that he would have to wait 12 weeks to have it done			1
instead of waiting , mr @entity3 spent £ 5,090 on the surgery and the next month he asked @entity2 and @entity33 , which is funded by the taxpayer , to cover the cost			1
the @entity33 agreed to pay £ 3,000 towards the operation as well as £ 240 for his physiotherapy			1
the fire service he heads is currently facing significant cuts to services with stations at risk of closure and engines due to be removed to help save £ 4million by 2016			2
@entity46 , director of the @entity47 ’ @entity45 said : ‘ residents will be angry that they ’ve had to cough up to pay for private treatment , when very few of them are able to afford it for themselves			0
‘ it says something when the public sector top brass do n’t use the @entity30 for their treatment , especially as everyone else is expected to be happy with it			0
‘ these perks must be scrapped , as taxpayers already foot hefty salaries and pensions			0
’ but councillor @entity64 , chairman of @entity2 and @entity33 , defended the decision saying mr @entity3 was ‘ very brave ’			1
he said : ‘ before the operation , he did get into work , but he was struggling at his desk , he was very brave			0
‘ if he went into an @entity30 hospital , it would have taken much longer			0
we wanted the chief back quickly and it was money well spent in my view			2
‘ he had no real length of time off ( before the surgery ) , but we looked at the figures and felt it was more expedient to get it done quickly			0
‘ @entity82 took the decision to make a payment towards the cost of the chief fire officer ’s back operation as it was at a time when the @entity33 was running a very detailed public consultation which affected the future of @entity91			1
‘ as such a significant piece of work was taking place we felt it necessary to have the chief fire officer back to work and fully fit as quickly as possible			1
’ headquarters : the fire service mr @entity3 heads is currently facing significant cuts to services with stations at risk of closure and engines due to be removed to help save £ 4million by 2016 but councillor @entity106 , who opposed granting mr @entity3 the money , said : ‘ i think it is shocking that he managed to get this operation virtually fully paid for			1
‘ it simply is n’t right that the public sector should subsidise private sector health care			0
‘ mr @entity3 clearly is a well paid man , he had a very good salary , better than most and during the meeting i made my position very clear			1
‘ i do n’t think the other councillors and mr @entity3 can be surprised at the backlash they are receiving			2
‘ it was common sense for me to reject his operation being paid for from the taxpayers , it is n’t fair and he should have enough money to cover the costs			0
’ burning building : @entity91 crews attend the scene of a fire - but their fire chief has come under fire for using taxpayer money @entity136 , secretary of the county ’s @entity137 said : ‘ this is very disappointing			2
we are facing losing jobs and engines			0
‘ if the fire authority can get railroaded into something like this what is the chance of saving appliances ? ‘ yet again the fire service is being dragged to the forefront and its nothing to do with firefighters , it ’s senior management			0
’ in a statement , @entity2 and @entity155 , said : ‘ he ( mr @entity3 ) was likely to be off work for up to 12 weeks whilst waiting for an @entity30 operation			1
‘ where @entity30 waiting lists are lengthy , the service has previously paid for staff members to be referred privately for consultant appointments			0
‘ in addition , we also fund other services for counselling and physiotherapy through occupational health			0
‘ each instance is reviewed on a case - by - case basis and all options are considered where it is deemed to be cost effective in progressing a diagnosis or treatment to enable an earlier return to work , and shown to be in the best interests of the service			0
‘ elected members considered it was in the @entity33 ’s best interests that he was able to return to work as soon as possible and therefore agreed to contribute £ 3,000 towards the total £ 5,090 cost of having the operation privately			2
‘ this contribution was less than the estimated £ 8,500 cost of additional payments to other officers if he had been absent for a prolonged period			0
’ mr @entity3 , who took over as chief fire officer in april 2010 , was unavailable for comment because he is on annual leave until march 26 , the fire service said .			1
