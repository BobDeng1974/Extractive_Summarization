@entity0 has launched an attack on @entity2 - saying the search giant has turned ' big and bad ' , and characterizing its chairman @entity4 as a government agent trying to further @entity8 ' imperialist ' ambitions			1
the @entity10 founder , who is under a @entity12 criminal investigation for leaking thousands of classified diplomatic cables , lashed out at the internet giant in an extract from an upcoming book			1
@entity0 , who has spent the past two years claiming asylum to avoid facing rape accusations , also detailed connections between @entity4 and the @entity8 establishment and implied @entity2 is acting as a front to enact @entity8 foreign policy			1
in a lengthy extract @entity0 hits out at the friendly image of the company - which has the official motto ' do n't be evil '			0
despite its cuddly image and free services , he said , @entity2 's mass harvesting of data and dominance of the internet are cause for ' serious concern ' worldwide			0
he said : ' nobody wants to acknowledge that @entity2 has grown big and bad			0
@entity4 ’s tenure as ceo saw @entity2 integrate with the shadiest of @entity8 power structures as it expanded into a geographically invasive megacorporation			1
' he then listed personal visits by @entity4 to politically sensitive countries , and referred to alleged support from the @entity58 for him to advance their objectives			0
he wrote : ' @entity4 ’s emergence as @entity2 ’s “ foreign minister ” - making pomp and ceremony state visits across geopolitical fault lines - had not come out of nowhere ; it had been presaged by years of assimilation within @entity8 establishment networks of reputation and influence			1
@entity71 : @entity0 has spent the past two years in the @entity72 in @entity73 , to which he fled to escape extradition to @entity76 over rape accusations ' on a personal level , @entity4 and @entity78 [ the other @entity2 executive he met ] are perfectly likable people			1
' but @entity2 ’s chairman is a classic “ head of industry ” player , with all of the ideological baggage that comes with that role			0
@entity4 fits exactly where he is : the point where the centrist , liberal and imperialist tendencies meet in @entity8 political life			2
' he later warns of @entity2 's ambitions to become an ' empire ' with influence reaching across the world			0

' its influence on the choices and behavior of the totality of individual human beings translates to real power to influence the course of history ... ' if the future of the @entity94 is to be @entity2 , that should be of serious concern to people all over the world - in @entity110 , @entity111 and @entity112 , the @entity114 subcontinent , the @entity115 , @entity116 , the @entity117 and even in @entity118 - for whom the @entity94 embodies the promise of an alternative to @entity8 cultural , economic , and strategic hegemony			1
' ' a “ do n’t be evil ” empire is still an empire			0
' @entity124 has contacted @entity2 for a response to @entity0 's claims			2
the publication comes as he awaits a decision tomorrow from @entity76 prosecutors over whether the international arrest warrant against him will be dropped			0
