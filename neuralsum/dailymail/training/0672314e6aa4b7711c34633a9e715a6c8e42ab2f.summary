there were more questions than answers for @entity3 on thursday night after an unbeaten qualifying run stretching back 36 games across eight years came to an end			0
it was not so much the defeat , as the symptoms of malaise that were so apparent at the @entity11 and show no signs of lifting			2
no one quite knows why @entity15 can score nine goals in nine matches for @entity18 and yet fail to score in any of his first six games for his adopted country			1
and no - one can fathom why a team that conceded just one goal as it won @entity41 now struggles to put together a defence worthy of the name			1
@entity15 ’s drought is made all the more baffling by the fact that he has club team - mate @entity25 alongside him in the national team			1
the pair linked well against @entity28 but without success			1
@entity15 struggled for his country again , failing to score in any of his first six games for his adopted country some commentators argue that @entity3 are too narrow to give @entity15 the service he requires			1
@entity57 ’s decision to drop @entity59 ’s @entity58 was one that puzzled most commentators and with @entity62 and @entity63 on the wings – both preferring to come inside with the ball – there is a lack of decent service into the striker from wide areas			2
while @entity15 has failed to score in six , @entity73 ’s young striker @entity72 has two in two and played instead of @entity15 when @entity3 beat @entity74 in their first qualifying match 5 - 1			1
there were calls for him to be kept in the side and when he came on , on thursday night he scored almost immediately			2
@entity18 's star endured another frustrating night in a @entity3 shirt as his international goal drought continued @entity73 ’s young striker @entity72 came off the bench to equalise for @entity57 's side no one doubts @entity15 ’s ability			1
but if @entity3 are to play the style of football that saw them win three straight tournaments many argue @entity72 ’s mobility and ability to link with his midfielders better suits the team ’s needs			0
in goal @entity35 cuts a sad figure			1
on thursday he pulled off one brilliant save from @entity98 but 10 minutes later could be seen fumbling at a free - kick that back in his pomp he would have thrown his proverbial cap on			0
he is desperate for the disappointing @entity11 not to be his last tournament and there have been signs in recent weeks at @entity106 that he is getting back to his best			2
here 's the view from the @entity109 press with as stating ' @entity111 from the @entity11			0
without aim , without luck and a gift from @entity35 ' whereas @entity115 highlights @entity35 ' calamitous performance in goal @entity106 's keeper @entity35 made a glaring error , fumbling a free - kick for @entity28 's opening goal but the latest mistake will encourage those who want him out of the side			1
in @entity125 has an in - form replacement			0
but @entity3 ’s defensive problems go deeper than @entity35 ’ form			2
there is a serious centre - back shortage not helped by the fact that most top sides in @entity133 do n’t have a @entity109 central defensive partnership			0
a lack of homegrown talent has been a typically @entity138 problem in the recent past but now @entity57 , like @entity140 , is scratching his head at a serious shortage of options			2
@entity144 have preferred @entity146 @entity145 and @entity148 @entity147 so far this season , leaving @entity150 watching from the bench			0
@entity144 's @entity150 ( left ) and @entity3 coach @entity57 ( right ) look glum at the final whistle at @entity106 @entity153 either has a @entity148 partner in @entity155 or a @entity157 accomplice in @entity158			1
and last season ’s title - winning campaign at @entity162 was based on a pairing of @entity165 @entity164 and @entity167 @entity166			0
such are the changes made by @entity169 to @entity170 qualifiying that there seems little chance @entity3 will not be in @entity148 for the 2016 tournament			0
but the questions will need answering in the meantime			0
perhaps some of the solutions will be on show on friday afternoon when the likes of @entity182 striker @entity181 , @entity179 full backs @entity183 and @entity184 , former @entity186 loanee @entity185 , and @entity188 defender @entity187 will all be on show for the @entity190 .			0

@entity57 's side last lost a qualifier in 2006 against @entity194
@entity28 's @entity29 scored in the 87th minute to secure 2 - 1 win
@entity106 keeper @entity35 was at fault for @entity28 's opening goal
@entity15 continued his international goal drought in defeat
