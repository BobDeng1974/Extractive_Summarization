by @entity1 reporter published : 09:37 est , 27 october 2012 updated : 16:52 est , 27 october 2012 ministers were last night accused of being ' asleep on the job ' for failing to act faster to combat a disease that could devastate the nation 's woodlands			2
the new environment secretary , @entity7 , was asked to explain why he is only now banning imports of ash trees when a fungus that kills them was first found in a @entity13 tree nursery in february			1
ash die - back , caused by the fungus chalara fraxinea , has wiped out 90 per cent of ash trees in @entity17 and is widespread in central @entity18			1
@entity20 imports : @entity22 tree imports from @entity18 will be banned from monday due to a fungus , which causes leaf loss and crown dieback , which is becoming widespread in @entity18 ash dieback had previously been identified in nurseries and recently planted sites including a car park , a college campus and new woodland , but has now been found in the wider environment at sites in @entity34 , increasing fears it could wreak the same kind of damage as @entity40 elm disease in the 1970s			1
mr @entity7 told the @entity42 4 today programme : ‘ i will bring in a ban on monday , having discussed this over the weekend with officials and experts			1
‘ i have already prepared the legislation and we are ready to go			0
the evidence is clearly there			0
’ the president of the @entity52 , @entity53 , welcomed the import ban but said it may not be enough to stop an epidemic			1
with chalara fraxinea already present in woods in @entity60 and @entity61 , @entity57 faces the threat one of the best - loved features of its landscape , he said			0
mr @entity53 said : ‘ we are very pleased to hear that the ban is going to be announced on monday			1
' national tragedy ' : @entity22 trees make up around 30 per cent of the wooded landscape and the fungus has already been discovered in at least 11 woods in @entity60 and @entity61 ‘ i think the real concern is that geographically , it looks like the disease may have arrived into the wild on the wind			2
’ asked if the ban would make a difference to the spread of the disease , he said : ‘ it may not			1
it depends on the extent to which we find the disease in the wild throughout the rest of the country			2
‘ it has already have been discovered in at least 11 woods in @entity60 and @entity61			0
’ it was ‘ a great pity ’ that the discovery of the disease in @entity57 in spring was not announced at the time			2
he said : ‘ it would n’t have made a great deal of difference banning imports in the spring , because most of the imports would have taken place			2
‘ but we certainly should have been told about it in the spring			0
ready to stop them : environment secretary @entity7 is ' ready to go ' on the ban which has been blamed for the introduction of the fungus in @entity57 ‘ it ’s a great pity that we were n’t told about it until two or three weeks ago , whereas it clearly had been discovered in nursery stock and young trees in the spring			1
i think we could have started looking for it - the real concern is to find out the true extent of it			0
’ ‘ if the ash stock in the countryside is devastated , it will be a national tragedy			1
’ in the @entity57 , ash trees make up around 30 per cent of the wooded landscape , across woodlands , hedgerows and parks			2
the @entity124 has called for an emergency summit or taskforce to be set up by the government to tackle tree diseases , before another species is lost for good			2
the @entity130 is urging forest managers and tree professionals to use the information on its website about the disease , inspect trees again and report any suspected to be infected			1
as a precaution , the @entity130 is suspending the planting of ash trees in public forests it manages			1
the @entity141 has also urged members to abide by a voluntary moratorium on importing ash trees for planting in this country			2
mr @entity7 said that the import ban would be accompanied by very strict movement restrictions on ash trees already in the country , to prevent the danger of spreading the disease to areas of the country which have not yet been affected			1
he denied that the @entity127 had acted slowly since the disease was first detected in the @entity57 in february , pointing out that more than 1,000 sites had already been checked and 50,000 trees burnt			0
mr @entity7 , who was appointed @entity157 in @entity159 ’s september reshuffle , told today : ‘ the disease was first identified in a nursery in @entity162 on february 24 during a routine inspection			0
‘ it was then confirmed on march 7 and through the summer a very detailed process has gone on of identifying where the trees have come from and where they have gone			0
during this process , more than 1,000 sites have been investigated and 50,000 trees have already been burnt			0
ash dieback is a serious disease of ash trees caused by a fungus called @entity174 ( @entity176 fraxinea )			1
the disease causes leaf loss and crown dieback in affected trees , as pictured right , and it can lead to tree death			1
@entity18 trees now believed to have been infected with this newly identified pathogen were first reported dying in large numbers in @entity185 in 1992 and it spread rapidly to other @entity18 countries			1
however , it was 2006 before the fungus ’s asexual stage , @entity191 , was first described by scientists , and 2010 before its sexual stage , @entity194 pseudo-albidus , was described			0
in february 2012 it was found in a consignment of infected trees sent from a nursery in the @entity40 to a nursery in @entity162			0
since then it has been found in a number of locations and situations in @entity205 and @entity206 , including a car park in @entity208 ; a @entity130 woodland at @entity210 , near @entity211 , west of @entity212 ; a college campus in @entity214 ; and a property in @entity216			0
he said : ‘ when i came in in september , a consultation with the industry had just started and i made absolutely sure it took as short a time as possible			0
‘ over the weekend , i will be talking to experts who will already have prepared , on my instruction , legislation so if the evidence shows it is necessary , and i think it will , we will bring in a ban on monday morning			1
’ the chief executive of the @entity124 , @entity228 , said : ‘ we are clearly pleased to see @entity7 finally taking action to introduce a ban on the import of ash trees in to the @entity57			1
‘ we would also urge the secretary of state to ban the movement of ash around the @entity57 until the extent of ash dieback , and how it is spread , has been determined			1
‘ we also ask @entity127 scientists to give urgent and clear advice to all woodland owners on how to manage the disease			0
@entity242 will do all it can to mitigate spread in line with this @entity127 instruction and advice			0
‘ we must stress however , that ash dieback is only one of numerous tree pests and diseases present in the @entity57			2
‘ with more than 15 separate pests and diseases listed on the @entity130 website as already present , it is crucial that the wider issue is tackled			0
‘ the government must set up an emergency summit bringing together representatives from all areas of forestry , plant health and conservation because today it ’s ash but tomorrow yet another of our precious native trees could be at risk			0
