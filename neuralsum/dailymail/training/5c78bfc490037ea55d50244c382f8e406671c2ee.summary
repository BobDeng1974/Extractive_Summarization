whistleblowing @entity1 officer @entity0 , who exposed extensive police corruption among his peers , has spoken about the february 1971 day in which he suffered a gunshot wound to the face - and how his fellow officers failed to help him			1
in an essay for @entity8 , @entity0 describes how he and two narcotics officers were investigating an alleged drug dealer in @entity11 - before he goes into what he sees as the continued need for the police to be externally reviewed and held responsible for their actions			1
on the day of the shooting , @entity0 says his body became stuck when the man they were investigating tried to shut a front door			1
dangerous : @entity0 , seen in this december 2011 file photo , says two officers failed to offer aid when he was facing off with an alleged drug dealer in 1971 @entity27 adaptation : @entity0 's life story was later turned into the 1973 movie ' @entity30 , ' starring @entity31			1
a still from the film is seen here ' i could n’t move , but i aimed my snub - nose @entity36 revolver at the perp [ ... ] from behind me no help came , ' he writes			0
' at that moment my anger got the better of me			0
i made the almost fatal mistake of taking my eye off the perp and screaming to the officer on my left : " what the hell you waiting for ? give me a hand ! " i turned back to face a gun blast in my face			1
i had cocked my weapon and fired back at him almost in the same instant , probably as reflex action , striking him			0
' he later says that ' when i opened my eyes i saw an old @entity60 man looking down at me like @entity62 ’s @entity61			0
my " backup " was nowhere in sight			0
they had n’t even called for assistance — i never heard the famed " @entity68 , " meaning " @entity67			2
" they did n’t call an ambulance either , i later learned ; the old man did			1
one patrol car responded to investigate , and realizing i was a narcotics officer rushed me to a nearby hospital [ ... ]			2
' @entity0 writes that ' the next time i saw my " back - up " officers was when one of them came to the hospital to bring me my watch			1
i said , “ what the h * * * am i going to do with a watch ? what i needed was a back - up			0
where were you ? ” he said , “ f * * * you , " and left			0
both my " back - ups " were later awarded medals for saving my life			0
' poor treatment : @entity0 , seen next to an image of @entity31 playing the @entity1 cop , says people continue to send him hate mail @entity0 says in the essay penned for @entity8 ' even now , i do not know for certain why i was left trapped in that door by my fellow police officers			1
but the narcotics division was rotten to the core , with many guys taking money from the very drug dealers they were supposed to bust			2
i had refused to take bribes and had testified against my fellow officers			1
' he continues ' police make up a peculiar subculture in society			2
more often than not they have their own moral code of behavior , an " us against them " attitude , enforced by a @entity115			0
it ’s their version of the @entity119 ’s omerta			0
speak out , and you ’re no longer " one of us			0
" you ’re one of " them			0
" ' @entity0 claims to ' still get hate mail from active and retired police officers ' in the years following his testimony before the @entity128 on police corruption			1
his life story was later made into a movie , called ' @entity30 , ' with @entity31 playing him			0
@entity0 writes that ' an even more serious problem — police violence — has probably grown worse , and it ’s out of control for the same reason that graft once was : a lack of accountability			1
' corruption : @entity0 says of his time with the @entity1 that ' the narcotics division was rotten to the core , with many guys taking money from the very drug dealers they were supposed to bust ' the former @entity1 cop says ' today the combination of an excess of deadly force and near - total lack of accountability is more dangerous than ever : most cops today can pull out their weapons and fire without fear that anything will happen to them , even if they shoot someone wrongfully			1
all a police officer has to say is that he believes his life was in danger , and he ’s typically absolved			1
what do you think that does to their psychology as they patrol the streets — this sense of invulnerability ? the famous old saying still applies : power corrupts , and absolute power corrupts absolutely			0
' he also dismisses the idea that police officers should use certain types of equipment while on the job			1
' the automatic weapons and bulletproof vest may protect the officer , but they also insulate him from the very society he ’s sworn to protect , ' he asserts			2
' all that firepower and armor puts an even greater wall between the police and society , and solidifies that " us - versus - them " feeling			2
' @entity0 says in the years following his testimony before the @entity190 ' politicians who wanted to make a difference did n't ' - and uses president @entity192 and mayor @entity193 as examples			2
' as for @entity196 and his attorney general , @entity197 , they ’re giving speeches now , after @entity199 , ' he writes			0
' but it ’s 20 years too late			0
' at the end of his essay for @entity8 , @entity30 offers a six - point solution , which he says includes police using better methods to find new police officers , offering ' examples - based training and simulations , ' making sure cops understand their communities and are active in them , holding police accountable when they do something illegal , rewarding and recognizing honest police officers , and also making sure police are monitored externally .			1
