a committee of @entity1 is under fire after claiming cuts in @entity5 's spending on international aid could have contributed to the spread of the ebola virus			1
ministers were accused by the international development committee of undermining £ 20 million of previous @entity5 - funded work in @entity12 by failing to help prevent the government there holding back @entity16 - channelled aid from the health sector			1
but government sources dismissed the idea @entity5 was to blame for the spread of the deadly disease as ' factually wrong '			1
a summit on how to tackle the spread of the virus is being held in @entity41 today			1
foreign secretary @entity42 , development secretary @entity43 and @entity44 , the president of @entity45 , are among those taking part in the global event at @entity49 in central @entity41			1
the @entity50 has promised a further £ 20 million aid to pay for vital medical supplies including chlorine , personal protection equipment such as masks , protection suits and gloves , and essential water and sanitation facilities			0
it will also be used to deploy clinicians , global health experts , epidemiologists and infection control advisers from @entity65 , @entity66 and the @entity67			0
but the @entity69 international development committee said that while that was a welcome move , far wider action was needed to reverse a failure to prioritise @entity45 and @entity12			1
in a scathing report , the parliamentary watchdog said the crisis ' demonstrates the dangers of ignoring the least developed countries in the world ' , accusing ministers and aid agencies of switching focus to ' higher - profile ' places			1
international development secretary @entity43 insisted the government was acting to help countries affected by the outbreak the mps accused the @entity87 ( @entity87 ) and the @entity16 of doing nothing to deal with the fact that tens of billions of pounds of @entity16 - led health aid was not being passed on by @entity12 's finance ministry			1
' there is an alarming lack of capacity in the health system , including a shortage of skilled clinicians , ' the @entity1 said , noting that 10 per cent of @entity45 's domestically trained nurses are working in the @entity5 health system			2
the committee said it was ' shocked ' to discover that only 3.9 million @entity102 dollars ( £ 2.4 million ) of 60 million dollars ( £ 37 million ) @entity16 health sector support was passed on by @entity12 's ministry of finance to the ministry of health over a two - year period			2
' neither the @entity16 nor @entity87 seemed to be doing anything to resolve the situation			0
@entity87 has been working for the last five years on building up the @entity12 health system and have spent £ 20 million doing so			0
' ministers should be concerned that this work is being undone , not least because @entity87 provides 16 per cent of its total budget to the @entity16 ( £ 1.23 billion )			0
' but miss @entity43 insisted said @entity5 was ' working urgently with @entity45 to scale up the international response to the disease '			1
' last month , @entity5 pledged to support 700 treatment beds in @entity45 , but keeping basic public health services running is vital to halt the spread of the disease			1
' our latest support will allow stretched medical staff and aid agencies to prevent further infection			1
' a government source added : ' it is just factually wrong to claim that an @entity25 outbreak could have been prevented , and factually wrong to suggest @entity5 is not helping @entity45 in its hour of need			2
' more than 40 @entity5 military personnel and aid experts are working in @entity45 following a direct request for assistance from the @entity131 and the country 's government			1
more than 160 @entity135 staff are due to travel to @entity45 after answering a call for volunteers to help fight the disease earlier this month			0
doctors and scientists are in a race against time to find a medical solution to the epidemic that is spiralling out of control			0
select committee chairman sir @entity146 said the scale of the crisis ' may well be connected to declining levels of international support for health system improvements ' in @entity12 and @entity45			1
' in the midst of this devastating epidemic , and at a time when the @entity5 has reached its 0.7 % target for overseas development assistance , it is wrong for the @entity5 to cut its support to these two countries by nearly a fifth , ' he said			1
' the planned termination of further @entity5 funding to the @entity12 health sector is especially unwise			2
' the @entity5 can be proud of the work @entity87 has done to help deliver many improvements in @entity45 and @entity12 following the civil wars in both countries			2
we believe that this work should continue through bilateral aid programmes			0
' it is also good that in the short time since our report was agreed @entity87 has provided extra support for @entity25 and many @entity135 staff have volunteered to go to @entity45			0
' however , @entity5 ministers must now work harder to track the use of sector support given to @entity12 and @entity45 through multilaterals we help fund			2
' experts believe they have a 90 - day window to halt the spread of @entity25 , which could otherwise have infected around 1.5 million people by january experts believe they have a 90 - day window to halt the spread of @entity25 , which could otherwise have infected around 1.5 million people by january			2
the death toll from the highly infectious condition , which has spread across @entity189 , @entity12 and @entity45 , has reportedly risen to more than 3,000			0
at least 3,700 children have lost one or both parents to the virus since the start of the outbreak , according to preliminary @entity196 figures , with fears that this could have doubled by the middle of next month			0
@entity201 chief executive @entity200 said : ' the @entity50 has taken the lead on supporting @entity45 to tackle this crisis , but it can not act alone			0
' the scale of the @entity25 epidemic is devastating and growing every day , with five people infected every hour in @entity45 last week			0
' we need a co-ordinated international response that ensures treatment centres are built and staffed immediately			0
' this is not only an immediate humanitarian threat , but risks completely undoing the hard work which has been done to build up fragile health systems in @entity45 and @entity12 after the devastating wars of the past few decades			0
