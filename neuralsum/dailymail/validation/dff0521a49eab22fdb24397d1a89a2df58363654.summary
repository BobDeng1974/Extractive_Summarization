mr @entity0 said the final decision on whether or not to ring - fence military spending would not be made until after the election			1
the failure to protect military spending – while guaranteeing cash for foreign aid – has sparked fury on the @entity1 backbenches			1
up to 30 conservative mps are thought to be backing a bid by @entity31 , mp for @entity32 and @entity33 , to force a protest vote against defence cuts in the commons this week			2
@entity29 claim that if the chancellor @entity38 gets his way @entity22 's military spending will fall below 2 per cent of gdp – despite the prime minister using a @entity4 summit in @entity43 to publicly shame other countries into hitting that target			1
mr @entity46 fears it will damage relations with @entity50 president @entity49 , who urged him last month not to set a bad example to other @entity4 nations by cutting spending			1

but defence spending in the @entity22 is forecast to drop to 1.7 per cent by 2020 defence spending in the @entity22 is forecast to drop to 1.7 per cent by 2020 , even without further cuts			1
mr @entity0 , speaking this morning on the @entity81 's @entity80 show , was asked if @entity22 could afford to cut defence spending with the growing threat posed by @entity83 and @entity84 in the @entity85			1
it came after he admitted @entity22 's relations with @entity88 could be ' prickly ' for many years - and described the country as an ' adversary '			0
he said it was clear @entity22 was ' not going to fight the @entity88 in @entity92 ' , but insisted there was a ' hard red line ' protecting @entity4 's @entity96 members from @entity88 incursions			0
mr @entity0 added : ' we 're the second largest defence spender in @entity4 , we 've got a huge equipment programme modernising our armed forces			1
' ' we led the charge encouraging our @entity4 partners to make this commitment			0
many of them are far , far away from two per cent			0
' but he said the government would not set out its defence spending plans until after the next election at ' the beginning of the next parliament '			1
he said : ' there are two things i ca n't do today			0
i ca n't tell you what will be in the conservative manifesto but you 'll find out soon enough , and i ca n't prejudge the outcome of the security and defence review and the spending review that will take place after the next election			1
' but @entity46 led the charge on the @entity4 two per cent commitment at the summit in @entity43 last year			0
' he is passionate about our armed forces , he has always been absolutely clear that he is not prepared to preside over any further cuts in our regular armed forces			0
so he knows where he wants to go			0
' but we 've got very difficult decisions to make in delivering our long - term economic plan to get @entity22 out of deficit and staring to pay down instead			0
' we 've got to make those difficult balanced decisions , but we will protect the integrity and the strength of our armed forces			0
' @entity80 tried 10 times to get the foreign secretary to guarantee military spending @entity80 : ‘ we have @entity88 submarines testing our waters and @entity88 jets buzzing our airspace , and at the same time we are not committing ourselves to maintaining the @entity4 minimum defence spending			1
where do you stand on that ? ’ @entity0 : ‘ well , clearly i was defence secretary for nearly three years , i ’m a passionate supporter of the armed forces and of maintaining @entity22 ’s military strength			1
and we are spending two per cent of our gdp			1
’ @entity80 : ‘ you ’re not committing the party to doing that at the next election			2
’ @entity0 : ‘ well , we ’re the second largest defence spender in @entity4 , we ’ve got a huge equipment programme modernising our armed forces			1
‘ we ’re building the two largest aircraft carriers the @entity161 has ever had			0
we ’re equipping them with the world ’s most advanced fighter aircraft , we ’re launching a submarine			0
’ @entity80 : ‘ but you do n’t commit to two per cent going ahead			0
’ @entity0 : ‘ well , we led the charge at the @entity167			2
’ @entity80 : ‘ we ’re going to look damn silly if we do n’t do it ourselves			0
’ @entity0 : ‘ we led the charge encouraging our @entity4 partners to make this commitment			2
many of them are far , far away from two per cent			0
’ @entity80 : ‘ so we want it too then do n’t we ? ’ @entity0 : ‘ we will have a strategic defence and security review at the beginning of the next parliament and a spending review and we will set out our future plans then			1
but we are committed to the two per cent target			2
’ @entity80 : ‘ through the course of the next parliament ? ’ @entity0 : ‘ we will set out the defence spending			1
’ @entity80 : ‘ i ’m sorry , but a lot of people want to know whether the country can trust the conservatives over defence and the two per cent target is crucial to this			2
‘ there ’s an argument going on about it , we all understand that , inside the @entity194			0
as foreign secretary surely you can commit yourself personally to the two per cent			1
@entity0 : ‘ there are two things i ca n’t do today			2
i ca n’t tell you what will be in the conservative manifesto but you ’ll find out soon enough , and i ca n’t prejudge the outcome of the security and defence review and the spending review that will take place after the next election			1
’ @entity80 : ‘ can you at least therefore … ’ @entity0 : ‘ @entity46 led the charge on the @entity4 two per cent commitment at the summit in @entity43 last year			2
’ @entity80 : ‘ and therefore you could at least commit yourself to agreeing with @entity209 that he would look pretty damn silly if he did n’t then commit himself to two per cent for this country ? ’ @entity0 : ‘ look , i worked closely with the prime minister on this subject when i was defence secretary for three years			1
he is passionate about our armed forces , he has always been absolutely clear that he is not prepared to preside over any further cuts in our regular armed forces			0
so he knows where he wants to go			0
‘ but we ’ve got very difficult decisions to make in delivering our long - term economic plan to get @entity22 out of deficit and staring to pay down instead			0
we ’ve got to make those difficult balanced decisions , but we will protect the integrity and the strength of our armed forces			0
’ @entity80 : ‘ so no cuts to the @entity22 army – no further cuts to the @entity22 army			0
no ifs , no buts , that ’s an absolutely clear policy ? ’ @entity0 : ‘ the prime minister has been very clear that he is not prepared to see further cuts in the size of the regular armed forces			2
