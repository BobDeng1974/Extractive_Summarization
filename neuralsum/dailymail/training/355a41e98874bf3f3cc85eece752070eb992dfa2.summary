@entity0 has hit out at @entity1 , claiming that the @entity3 star will win the @entity4 as much for his image as his skills			1
the @entity8 goalkeeper is considered one of the front - runners for this year 's award , but some way behind the favourite @entity1			1
@entity0 seemed to suggest his chances are hampered because , unlike @entity1 , he does n't go in for the ' red - carpet ' lifestyle , or have underwear modelling deals			1
' i 'm not some guy who poses in his underpants			0
' ' i do n't like the red carpet			1
i prefer the green turf			0
i feel better on the pitch trying to be the best i can be			0
' @entity0 was a key part of the @entity8 team that won last summer 's @entity26 , and the most likely from the squad to win the individual award			1
@entity1 , who will be playing at @entity43 on tuesday night , is the favourite for the @entity4 the @entity3 star has won the @entity4 twice , most recently in 2013 , and looks set to win again @entity0 says it is difficult for goalkeepers to win the award , which has n't gone to a stopper since 1963 but the @entity51 stopper believes that goalkeepers have little chance of winning individual awards			1
the @entity4 has not been awarded to a goalkeeper since 1963 , and only two defenders have won it in the past 20 years			0
' after the games , the main things they show are goals , the chances , the assists , ' explained @entity0			2
' spectators do n't tend to remember that the keeper stopped difficult balls by taking a big risk or organised the play from the back			0
' @entity70 captain @entity69 will hope to show on tuesday night that he is still on a level with @entity1 @entity1 has won the @entity4 twice while @entity69 has been given the award on four occassions @entity1 is on course to win the @entity4 for the third time , and the second in a row , but faces competition from @entity79 and four - time winner @entity69			2
the two front - runners will meet in an international friendly at @entity43 on tuesday night when @entity70 take on @entity82 , in a game that is being billed as a shoot - out for the top individual award			0
both players have been backed by their respective international managers and team - mates ahead of the voting , with @entity82 manager @entity90 conceding ' they are both genius '			0
@entity69 and @entity1 , unlike @entity0 , are the most famous and most marketable players in world football , and whatever happens at @entity43 , are likely to dominate the votes			2
