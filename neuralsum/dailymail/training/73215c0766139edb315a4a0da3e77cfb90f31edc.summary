sure , @entity1 's claws were impressive , but how would one of the most famous x-men have coped if he 'd tried to survive at a height of over 14,000ft ? the answer would most likely be ' not well ' , but while off - limits to some , it turns out that people such as @entity9 can thrive in the thin air of high - altitude areas thanks to an 8,000 year - old mutation			1
researchers say they 've successfully identified this genetic variation for the first time , and it could explain how some people can survive in these extreme environments			1
researchers say @entity9 ( pictured ) have a genetic variation that enables them to survive in high altitude , low oxygen environments			1
this could explain how they can survive at heights of 14,800 feet ( 4,510m ) the research from the @entity25 appears in the journal @entity27 and looked at areas such as the @entity29			1
' these findings help us understand the unique aspects of @entity29 adaptation to high altitudes , and to better understand human evolution , ' said dr @entity36 , senior author and @entity25 professor of internal medicine			0
in 2010 @entity40 ’s group was the first to establish that there was a genetic basis to @entity29 high altitude adaptation			1
since then , together with dr @entity45 , the team have proved that the @entity46 of @entity9 has a slight variation that prevents their body struggling with a lack of oxygen			2
instead , 88 per cent of @entity9 have the mutation that enables their bodies to thrive in low - oxygen environments , something that is virtually absent from closely related lowland @entity55			1
it is believed the change began 8,000 years ago , when the gene @entity58 changed by a single dna base pair			1
the findings indicate the tiny genetic change endows its carriers with a selective advantage			1
for his research , dr @entity36 needed @entity9 to donate blood , from which he could extract their dna , a task that turned out to be more difficult than he ever imagined			2
it took several trips to @entity55 , meeting with @entity74 officials and representatives of exiled @entity9 in @entity76 , to get the necessary permissions to recruit subjects for the study			2
but he quickly learned that official documents would not be enough			0
wary of foreigners , the @entity9 refused to participate			0
to earn the @entity9 ’ trust , dr @entity36 obtained a letter of support from the @entity29 spiritual leader , the @entity86			0
' @entity86 felt that a better understanding of the adaptation would be helpful not only to the @entity29 community but also to humanity at large , ' said dr @entity36			0
he also enlisted the help of native dr @entity92 , an author and clinical fellow at the @entity94 at the @entity25			0
more than 90 @entity9 , both from the @entity95 and abroad , ultimately volunteered for the study			0
when traveling with dr @entity92 in @entity55 , dr @entity36 was surprised at how he got @entity9 to grasp the research they were being asked to take part in			0
dr @entity92 simply helped them realise that their ability to adapt to life at high altitude was unique			2
' they usually responded by a little initial surprise quickly followed by agreement , ' said dr @entity92			0
' it was as if i made them realise something new , which only then became obvious			0
' the mutation , believed to have originated 8,000 years ago , gives @entity9 a selective advantage in their environment over other humans			1
the finding could lead to novel solutions for diseases such as cancer			2
@entity117 is a high - altitude plateau region north - east of the @entity119 in @entity74 ( shown ) for his research , dr @entity36 ( shown ) needed @entity9 to donate blood , from which he could extract their dna , a task that turned out to be more difficult than he ever imagined			1
it took several trips to @entity55 , meeting with @entity74 officials and representatives of exiled @entity9 in @entity76 , to get the necessary permissions dr @entity36 collaborated with experts throughout the world , including co-senior author dr @entity131 from @entity132 in @entity133 , to determine that the newly identified genetic variation protects @entity9 by decreasing an aversive over-response to low oxygen			1
in those without the adaptation , the thin air causes their blood to become thick with oxygen - carrying red blood cells , often causing long - term complications such as heart failure			0
the @entity58 variation however , together with other unidentified genetic changes , collectively supports life at high altitudes			2
dr @entity36 says the research also has broader implications			0
because oxygen plays a central role in human physiology and disease , a deep understanding of how high altitude adaptations work may lead to novel treatments for various conditions , including cancer			1
' there is much more that needs to be done , and this is just the beginning , ' he said			0
