the birth of a child is one of the most significant moments in a family 's life			2
many are fortunate enough to experience this in the comfort of a hospital , before driving home with nothing but a table - load of presents and sleepless nights to worry about			2
for this family from @entity17 , @entity18 , the situation was quite different , as they were forced to travel on foot for 45 miles to get to the nearest hospital			1
a different world : as there is no doctor or hospital facility in the village where the family live , they were forced to travel on foot down river @entity28 , at an altitude of 11,123ft , for nine days - and then make the same journey back when the baby was born latest addition : the newborn baby is wrapped up warm for the nine - day journey back to their home town in @entity17 , @entity18 long journey : another member of the family carries the newborn 's older sibling as they make their way up the frozen river , walking for eight hours a day it took them nine days to get to their destination , @entity49 , the nearest town with a hospital , after which they had to return the same way they came - up a frozen mountain river in temperatures of -35c			1
a photographer encountered the family during their nine - day journey home with their newborn baby in a basket , carrying a young child			1
the frozen river @entity66 is at an altitude of 11,123 ft , and the family walked for eight hours - a - day over the frozen river often up to their knees in bitingly cold water			1
the family were forced to carry both provisions and children , and camped in mountain caves at night as they trekked back to their home town			1
the photos were captured by photographer @entity80 from @entity81 who was trekking up the @entity66 with his friends when he spotted the weather - beaten family			0
no other option : the family had to bring food , blankets and other provisions on their backs or on sleds and camped out in caves at night before continuing their gruelling walk in the morning tough trek : the family were sometimes forced to wade through icy water and snow after the cold weather blocked the roads from @entity17 to the hospital in @entity49 keeping warm : a cave in the mountainside serves as shelter for the night as the family gathers around a fire in the freezing cold night @entity80 said : ‘ one day we met then this family with the little son and newborn , i was amazed what it is normal for someone to go through to get a child ! ‘ for me its just incredible , how easy and how much help we get in the western world to give birth in comparison - when you saw this little child and baby , how cold they have been , what they have to do			1
’ ‘ the @entity126 is big and fast flowing			0
for most if its length between @entity128 and the @entity129 is confined within a steep canyon			0
‘ walking over the frozen river and very cold rushing water just a few inches below your feet is terrifying			0
‘ travelling from @entity136 , the capital of @entity17 to @entity49 takes four to five days under the best conditions and the long winter snow closes the roads and passes entirely for six months annually			0
‘ the local people use the river to carry goods for their livelihood and sometimes people die during the dangerous trip			0
’ as one : family members brought larger sleds to be able to provide some relief for the mother as she recovers from giving birth travelling from @entity136 , the capital of @entity17 to @entity49 , where the hospital is takes around five days in the summer , but during the winder , snow closes the roads and mountain passes and the frozen river is the only way out			2
