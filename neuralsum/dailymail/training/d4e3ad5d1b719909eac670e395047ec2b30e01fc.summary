by @entity0 published : 03:13 est , 4 july 2013 updated : 03:13 est , 4 july 2013 middle class squatters who turned a contaminated site near @entity3 into an organic market garden have lost their appeal against eviction			1
but senior judge sir @entity7 , who dismissed their challenge to a county court decision to evict them , said ' not all squatters were bad '			1
the group , known as @entity3 , trespassed onto the private land , in @entity14 , @entity15 , in march 2010			2
they cleared the former plant nursery of car fuel spillage and rubbish before restoring it with a range of glass houses , which became their homes			0
@entity3 , squatters who turned a contaminated site near @entity3 into an organic market garden , have lost their appeal against eviction @entity3 , also known as @entity28 , describes itself as a grassroots action group described as mature , intelligent and highly articulate individuals who has simply chosen a different way of life , they won the praise and support of the villagers			1
but judges at the @entity38 said , they - or at least some of them - were experienced squatters and knew precisely what they were doing when they entered the land			0
dismissing their challenge to a county court decision , in july 2012 , to make a possession order in favour of land owner , @entity45 , sir @entity7 said the idea that an @entity48 's home is his castle was firmly embedded in @entity48 folklore			1
' but what if the invaders occupy for long enough to establish their home within the keep ? whose castle is it now ? whose home must the law now protect ? ' he said			0
the group were described as mature , intelligent and highly articulate individuals who has simply chosen a different way of life , they won the praise and support of the villagers he added that the castle metaphor was quaint but outmoded and had been overtaken by human rights legislation			0
he said the traditional understanding of landowners ’ rights should be rethought			0
sir @entity7 said that an owner was entitled to the return of his property unless some exceptional circumstances militated against it			1
he said the county court which had ordered the eviction was fully alive to the fact that the group were ' good ' squatters and was obviously impressed by them and , to that extent , sympathetic towards them			2
sir @entity7 said that an owner was entitled to the return of his property unless some exceptional circumstances militated against it - even though the group were ' good squatters ' sir @entity7 added that he , too , could admire the good work they had done			1
he said that the position should be the same for private land as it is for public authorities , meaning that applications for possession orders should be subject to a proportionality test			0
however , his two fellow judges , @entity95 and @entity96 gave a majority decision that the traditional rule should still apply until a case that directly raises the point			0
they agreed that the appeal should be dismissed on the basis that the judge was entitled to find that immediate eviction would not be disproportionate			1
he said under provisions outlined in the @entity107 ( @entity107 ) , squatters have a right to respect for their homes ' , he said			0
' the castle metaphor is quaint but outmoded : the correct legal question to be asked since the @entity112 came into force in october 2000 is how , if at all , if squatters have established homes on the land without the leave of the landowner , does the court , faced with a claim for possession by a private landowner against the trespassers , give effect to the squatters ' right to respect for their homes guaranteed to them by @entity129 ? ' the judges ruled that the eviction order did not conflict with the squatters ’ rights under the @entity107			2
later , lawyer @entity133 of @entity134 , said : ' when @entity3 moved to the land , it was being used as a dumping ground for hazardous items			2
the @entity3 occupiers have since transformed the land into a flourishing community garden			1
they will now look to appeal directly to the @entity143 and will do everything they can to protect their community from being trashed again			0
