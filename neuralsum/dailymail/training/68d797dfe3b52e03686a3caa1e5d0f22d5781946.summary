@entity0 could be the man to end @entity2 ’s four - year tenure at @entity3 — and is keen on replacing him if the position becomes vacant			1
the atmosphere turned toxic at @entity6 ’s as @entity2 watched his team crumble against @entity8 to leave them bottom of the table and without a win in their first four league games			1
owner @entity13 was in the stands to witness his club ’s diabolical performance and could hear the away fans turn on @entity2 and constantly call for his head			1
@entity19 manager @entity0 is keen on replacing @entity2 if the position becomes vacant sources close to the @entity3 boss indicated he was in the dark about his future at the club yesterday , but @entity2 hosts @entity19 at @entity26 on saturday when there will be no let - up from the home supporters and defeat could spell the end			1
tensions will already be high			2
it is the first time @entity2 has been on the touchline against @entity19 since he headbutted their midfielder @entity35 last season			1
that earned him a seven - match ban from the @entity40 and a £ 100,000 fine from @entity3			2
@entity19 boss @entity0 remained coy on the possibility of taking over at @entity3 , the club he supports , but it is understood he is interested in the job if @entity2 is sacked			1
@entity3 fans have never really taken to @entity2 and are now calling for his head @entity0 said : ‘ after what happened to me at @entity47 i know how difficult the @entity48 is			1
i have only been at @entity19 a couple of years and they have been really good			2
they gave me the chance to get up and running again and for that i will always be grateful			0
’ on saturday , @entity8 were as good as @entity3 were bad			1
new signing @entity51 scored a header and tap - in in the opening 20 minutes which set the travelling supporters on @entity2 ’s back			2
goals from @entity59 , who had never scored a league goal in three years at the club , and @entity62 , in second - half stoppage time , finished them off			0
@entity2 's @entity3 have performed poorly since january when they sold @entity65 the travelling supporters who made a 660 - mile round trip unfurled banners saying ‘ @entity2 is a @entity69 ’ and ‘ @entity70 ’			1
@entity2 famously signed an eight - year contract with @entity3 just under two years ago , having led them to fifth place in the 2011 - 12 season			1
he told @entity74 : ‘ it is not easy to digest and not easy for the players either to play under those circumstances , so we have to be strong and try to tough it out this week and come back next week			0
‘ we just have to put ourselves on the line , really , and be brave			0
certainly , we have a bit more quality than we showed today , for sure , and we need to get that on the pitch			0
’ @entity8 manager @entity88 said : ‘ i understand how difficult the situation is for them , and for their manager			1
they have qualities , they showed that as well , and for that reason it was a great result for us			0
’ @entity3 owner @entity13 handed @entity2 an eight - year contract less than two years ago @entity3 legend @entity96 admitted @entity2 is under huge pressure			1
he said : ‘ results have not been good enough since january			0
‘ from the first minute , @entity8 went after @entity3 and they could not cope			1
having said all that , i am led to believe they spent nearly £ 40million but that the manager does not have a say in that			2
inevitably , in the long run , that does not work			0
’ the last time @entity3 failed to win their first four league games was in 2005 under @entity105			2
by february that season , he was gone			0
