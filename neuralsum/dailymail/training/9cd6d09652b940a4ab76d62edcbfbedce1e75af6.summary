balancing 100ft above the ground these @entity1 daredevils attempt a one of a kind high octane race			2
looking to cross 60 feet between two turrets at @entity6 in @entity7 , these daring highliners are set to appear on new @entity8 show @entity9 or @entity10			1
top @entity12 slackliners @entity13 , 24 , from @entity14 , and red - shirt @entity15 , 20 , from @entity17 , were to show off their skills in front of millions of @entity1 viewers			1
@entity21 ' n ' safety gone mad : @entity15 walks between two turrets at @entity24 for @entity25 on @entity8			1
it is the first time slackliners have been granted access to one of @entity12 's most picture - perfect castles do n't look down : @entity15 balances as he walks along the line which is a lot more wobbly than an ordinary tightrope slacklines are more like trampolines than tightropes because they move around a lot as the daredevil inches across			1
on @entity25 competitors fighting for the Â£ 1m prize will have to guess whether @entity13 or @entity15 will be first to get across			1
slackliner director , @entity42 , 36 , from @entity43 , @entity44 , was approached by the show 's producers to make sure they had the right people for the stunt performed in front of a live audience			2
' @entity8 called my office because we 're seen as the leading slackliners in the country , ' explained @entity42			2
daredevil : @entity13 walks along the line at the castle in @entity60			2
contestants on @entity25 take it in turns to bet which of them will be first to get across the line terrifying : @entity15 raises his arm above his head as he balances on his way across the wobbly slackline daredevils : @entity15 , left , and @entity13 were approached by @entity8 as they are the best slackliners in @entity12 ' they wanted to know about our experience and find out if this feat was even possible			1
' we started to discuss likely candidates and i decided on @entity13 and @entity15 because they both had climbing as well as slacklining backgrounds			1
' there was only going to shot at this , so we had to make sure we had people who could pull it off			2
' @entity13 has been a slackliner for four years and and @entity15 for three years - both are seasoned rock climbers in their own right			1
while this training has given them nerves of steel and they spent two full days practising for the stunt , nothing could have prepared them fully for the pressure of performing at such an impressive venue - as part of a televised competition			0
' before the event , @entity15 and @entity13 were both saying - is this really going to happen am i really going to step out over this massive void in front of masses of people ? ' said @entity42			1
' usually when they highline they 're doing it for their own satisfaction			0
' suddenly when your put in front of a massive crowd of screaming contestants you 've got that added pressure and expectation on your shoulders			0
' this is on top of the discipline and concentration you need to complete this incredibly demanding stunt			0
' the crowd were all jumping up and down - they could n't believe how good it went and the realise of tension was amazing			0
' even @entity127 could n't believe their eyes			0
' @entity129 may be new to most people - but surprisingly the sport has taken off in many parts of @entity12			0
' for this kind of high - lining you do need to have had years of training and a head for heights , ' said @entity42			0
' but other types of slacklining are hugely accessible and local clubs are running across the country			0
' this is the entry point to more spectacular stunts like this one			0
' it 's fantastic exercise with the kinds of eye - popping acrobatic moves that young people love to see and take part in			0
' high line : @entity15 edges across in the @entity8 competition			1
competitors on the @entity8 show try and guess how long it will take to get across			2

@entity13 , 24 , and @entity15 , 20 , will appear on @entity25 on @entity8
