the midwife ’s sister by @entity2 within the very sentimental world of sunday night television , @entity7 ’s heroine , @entity6 , was played with gentle reserve by actress @entity9			1
@entity7 ’s heroine , @entity6 ( left ) , is based on a real person but a startling new memoir by the sister of the midwife on whom the character is based suggests the real @entity6 was a more fiery and difficult character			1
the young @entity6 actually came to midwifery after being dismissed from her nursing course at the @entity19 for losing her temper and smacking a small child			1
then only months away from qualifying , the consultants pinned her near - perfect exam papers up on the notice board as an example to others			2
but she was deeply in love with a much older married man at the time , and @entity2 now believes that her sister ’s romantic frustrations were the cause of her angry outbursts			1
reading the details of the sisters ’ childhood , it ’s obvious that @entity6 had cause for anger long before her married lover refused to leave his wife			1
@entity42 was born in 1936 , the daughter of a post office clerk called @entity45 — a woman with ‘ bedroom eyes , fabulous hour - glass figure and great legs ’ — and a handsome chancer , @entity51 , who had whisked @entity45 away on his milk float from the dance at which they met			1
@entity2 came along in 1939 as @entity51 built up a successful haulage business			2
the first seven years of @entity2 ’s life were idyllic — she had parents who laughed and holiday adventures on the @entity60 coast with her fearless older sister			1
their mother flirted her way to extra luxuries during rationing			1
but everything changed one summer day in 1945 , when @entity45 came home to find her husband in bed with his secretary , @entity70			0
the girls were sent to a convent school run by nuns whose metal rulers left savage , red weals on dyslexic @entity2 ’s hands as she struggled to write			0
@entity42 kicked back at her tormentors and got the pair expelled			0
meanwhile , @entity51 married @entity70 and the wealthy couple moved to a luxurious country home — except for the room set aside for his two girls			1
that boasted bare boards , a bare lightbulb and one camp bed			0
the real @entity6 ( played in the @entity90 series by @entity9 , second right ) ended up in midwifery after being dismissed from her nursing course at the @entity19 for losing her temper @entity45 went on to marry a violent bully called @entity96 , who demanded the girls be out of his sight when he came home from work at 5pm			1
by this point , @entity2 claims , @entity42 had become quite violent , sometimes ‘ grabbing me by the hair and repeatedly banging my head against the wall ’			1
on one occasion , her older sister chased her around the house with a carving knife			0
@entity2 had done nothing to provoke the attacks — ‘ her fury was all to do with the collapse of home life ’			1
that collapse became total when 14 - year - old @entity42 accidentally stayed downstairs playing the piano after the 5 pm curfew			0
@entity96 slammed the piano lid onto her fingers and she was thrown out of the house the next morning			1
a year later , she lied about her age and got a job as secretary to a headmaster her mother would come to call ‘ @entity126 ’			2
@entity42 fell in love with him and there was a local scandal			0
he was the one who eventually insisted she move away to begin a career in nursing			2
@entity42 adored the profession , but while her sister studied , @entity2 preferred to party			0
marriage to an ambitious doctor seemed an easy way out , but when she needed spinal surgery shortly after the birth of her first daughter , she realised her husband was straying			0
she would go on to marry four times and have two more children , while @entity42 settled for a marriage with good friend @entity145 and had two daughters			0
@entity147 remained the love of her life			2
both girls moved into the arts after having their children			2
while @entity42 built a career as a concert pianist then a writer , @entity2 became a sculptor			1
@entity2 married into money , which @entity42 resented			2
and @entity42 ’s experience working with the nuns of @entity162 led her to become religious in a way that alienated her from @entity164 , who felt shut out by her sister ’s reliable response of ‘ go with @entity167 ’ to any dilemma			0
@entity2 felt she used it to justify a lack of engagement with other people ’s problems			0
but @entity2 says she found peace with her ‘ fierce , no - nonsense , brisk and kind ’ sister at the end			0
beneath the large ‘ @entity181 ’ notice pinned over the bed in which she died from cancer in 2011 , @entity42 finally relaxed and talked openly with @entity164 for the first time in decades			0
the following year , @entity2 celebrated their enduring bond in an 8 ft sculpture for @entity185 — two angels , strong and loving , with a narrow but unbreachable space between them .			0
