by @entity0 how it works : the new procedure could save lives a machine that hoovers away blood clots in the brain could save thousands of stroke patients from death or serious disability			1
clots are a leading cause of stroke – when the blood supply is cut off to part of the brain – and need to be removed as soon as possible to restore oxygen supply to cells and prevent further damage			1
usually intravenous drugs are used to break up the blockage			2
now 20 @entity21 hospitals are trialling the new procedure , known as intra-arterial thrombectomy , which takes just 12 minutes			1
a tube is inserted into an artery via the groin , then travels to the brain to suck up the clot			1
it has already saved patients such as 60 - year - old @entity31 , who suffered a massive stroke on the golf course two months ago			2
he was found to have a 2in blood clot starving his brain of oxygen			1
‘ his was a very dramatic recovery , ’ recalls dr @entity37 , a neuro - interventional radiologist at @entity38 , @entity39 , who says he has never before seen such a remarkable recovery from a stroke			2
‘ when he got him on to the operating table he was weak and could n’t move the left - hand side of his body			2
but we pulled the clot out and almost instantly he gave us the thumbs - up with his previously paralysed hand			0
’ the recovery was particularly striking as the standard clot - busting drug treatment had failed to help @entity31			1
about 152,000 @entity21 suffer a stroke each year and there are two main types – those caused by clots and those due to burst blood vessels			1
for nearly two decades , doctors have been able to reach up into the brain through the groin and stop bleeding caused by burst blood vessels			1
but the use of such technology to deal with a clot is more recent , and patients with clots in large blood vessels and arteries do less well than those with smaller clots			1
now medics want to show the @entity75 ( @entity75 ) that the ‘ hoover ’ is worth introducing on the @entity76			0
speed is crucial as there is an urgency to removing a clot , says dr @entity37			0
‘ millions of neurons a minute are being lost while the clot is blocking the flow of blood to the brain			1
' so every minute counts			0
we aim to treat patients within six hours of a stroke , but the target is three hours or even less – two if possible			0
’ a stroke team decides which patients qualify to have their brains ‘ hoovered ’ by performing a brain @entity96 scan			0
the procedure works by inserting a catheter ( a thin tube ) up to the brain through the arterial system			1
a smaller catheter is fed through it , with a probe on the end that breaks up the clot into small pieces which are then hoovered down the larger tube			1
dr @entity37 says it is aimed at removing clots from the top of the carotid artery running up from the neck , the middle cerebral artery feeding the top of the brain and the basilar artery at the back of the skull			2
need for speed : when removing a blood clot , speed is crucial in order to avoid a stroke , and the intra-arterial thrombectomy takes just 12 minutes ‘ these are the ones with the largest clots that do n’t respond at all well to intravenous drugs			1
they are often several inches thick and the drugs either do n’t work or take too long to break up the clot			0
’ @entity75 accepts the technology works but claims it still does n’t know enough about how patients fare			0
‘ this technology is well established in other @entity135 countries , but the @entity21 has lagged behind and we are catching up , ’ says dr @entity37			1
hundreds of patients are now being offered the hoover , either as part of the trial or separately like @entity31			0
he arrived at @entity39 ’s @entity141 paralysed down one side but within 48 hours found the weakness and paralysis had almost completely gone			0
dr @entity37 is convinced that without the treatment , @entity31 would have been left wheelchair - bound and severely disabled for the rest of his life			2
instead , he was back on the golf course just weeks later			0
@entity31 , a father of four from @entity149 , has suffered no long - term effects			0
he says : ‘ i have a friend who had a stroke seven years ago and she has not got her speech back and ca n’t move her arms and legs			0
‘ yet for all intents and purposes i am the same as i was before , and i play golf to virtually the same standard			0
if i had n’t had the procedure i would have been in hospital for six months trying to get my functions back and i would have had to have carers and be in a wheelchair			2
it ’s a miracle , really			0
