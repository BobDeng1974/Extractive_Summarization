@entity1 president @entity0 blew off @entity4 president @entity3 's claims this morning that he not telling the truth about his government 's relationship with @entity9 separatists in @entity10			1
' who is he to judge , ' @entity0 told @entity12 during an interview this morning			1
' who is he to judge , seriously ? ' he repeated , according to a translator			0
' if he wants to judge people , why does n't he get a job in court somewhere ? ' ' if [ president @entity3 ] wants to judge people , why does n't he get a job in court somewhere ? ' @entity1 president @entity19 said during an interview today @entity0 , right , told , @entity12 ' anchor @entity25 , left , during the @entity26 in @entity27 , @entity1 23 , that maybe @entity4 had put sanctions @entity1 businesses because it wanted an economic edge @entity0 made the comments during an on - stage interview at the @entity26 as @entity12 host @entity25 was telling him @entity3 had ' accused you , as you know , of untruths when it comes to supporting some of the separatists groups ... ' at that point , @entity0 interrupted @entity25 to make fun of president @entity3 , which drew laughter from the audience			1
in a more somber tone , @entity0 told added , ' i do n't think he accused me			0
' ' it 's his point of view			0
and i have my point of view , when it comes to certain things , ' he said			0
@entity25 then tried to ask him if his country would allow @entity10 's scheduled election to take proceed peacefully this sunday , to which @entity0 said , ' oh come , on , really ? he 's a difficult man to deal with			1
where did you get this guy ? ' pro-russian armed militants stand guard at a barricade which faces a position manned by @entity10 army soldiers , near the eastern @entity10 city of @entity62 , @entity63 region			0
@entity0 said today that the crisis in @entity10 had evolved into a full - scale civil war and blaming the @entity66 for escalating the crisis @entity1 and the @entity4 have been engaged in a stand off over the former country 's invasion @entity71 , which was under the control of @entity10 until february			1
in march , @entity71 broke off from the @entity10 with the help of @entity1 separatist forces and joined @entity1			0
@entity1 - backed separatists have since invaded other eastern areas of @entity10 , taken over government buildings , kidnapped journalists and engaged in deadly assaults with @entity10 security forces			1
@entity1 made an agreement with the @entity4 and @entity82 in mid-april that it would use its influence on the @entity9 forces in @entity10 to get them to vacate power , but the promise never came to fruition			1
' so far at least we have seen them not abide by the spirit or the letter of the agreement in @entity93 , ' president @entity3 said days later			2
' instead we continue to see malicious , armed men taking over buildings , harassing folks who are disagreeing with them , destabilizing the region and we have n't seen @entity1 step out and discouraging it			0
' when @entity1 still did not fulfill its part of the agreement , the @entity4 introduced sanctions on a handful of the countries businesses , singling out the ones whose executives had close ties with @entity1 's leader			2
' the goal here is not to go after mr. @entity0 personally , ' president @entity3 said in announcing the sanctions			1
' the goal is to change his calculus , ' @entity3 said , and ' encourage him to actually walk the walk and not just talk the talk when it comes to diplomatically resolving the crisis in @entity10			0
' on friday @entity0 claimed that the @entity66 was the blame for the instability in @entity10 , not @entity1 , and ' now , they want us to clean up the mess they created			2
' @entity0 called the sanctions on his friends ' illegal ' and said they ought to sue the @entity4 ' they do n't have any relation to the events in @entity10 or @entity71 , he said			1
' maybe the @entity4 , who are quite shrewd , want to win a competitive edge over @entity130 by insisting on introducing sanctions against @entity1 ? ' @entity0 acknowledged that that sanctions have hurt his friends ' businesses but said they are ' experienced entrepreneurs ' and will be just fine			2
the @entity1 leader also predicted that the @entity4 ' sanctions on his country would end up backfiring			0
' economic sanctions as a tool of political pressure are eventually going to attack the economy of the countries who have initiated the sanctions , ' he said			0
@entity0 joked that ' you ca nâ€™t force people to like you ' but he hopes ' common sense , good sense and national interest , will push ' the @entity4 and the other @entity130 countries that have place sanctions on his country to continue working with his country .			2
