it is n't easy being the backup qb to @entity2 - just ask @entity3			1
hilarious footage of the 23 - year - old being shut out of playing by the 38 - year - old @entity7 legend was broadcast to a sympathetic nation on sunday			0
with the @entity9 holding a 31 - point lead over the @entity11 , @entity3 excitedly grabbed his helmet in expectation of a rare start			0
scroll down for @entity15 what ? ! ! @entity3 turns to see @entity2 running out to marshal his troops - like he does every sunday oh man ... ... ... the realization that @entity2 will never yield to him , despite throwing the @entity9 to a 31 point victory dawns on @entity3 however , in a split second his face becomes a picture as he turns to see the older man running onto the field causing him to raise his other arm in total exasperation			1
at that priceless moment , @entity3 probably realized why @entity2 has in excess of 1,000 career touchdowns and is widely regarded as one of the best quarterbacks of all time			1
however , it was n't all that bad for @entity3			0
probably protecting his ageing frame , @entity2 did let the younger man take to field in the fourth quarter			0
however , whereas @entity2 finished with 31 - of - 44 completions for 340 yards and five tds , @entity3 came on for two of five passes for a grand total of 13 yards			2
am i ever gon na get a go ? massive disappointment crashes over @entity3 's face as @entity2 seemingly ignores him i give up ! @entity3 is resigned to defeat as @entity2 stares down his offensive line and prepares them for battle can i have just one go ... ever ? @entity3 is a man defeated as some of his backroom staff turn to commiserate with him			2

priceless *reaction* from back - up qb @entity3 as @entity2 *denies* him the *chance* to play despite rout
