@entity1 look set for a third consecutive @entity3 relegation battle this season and supporters are beginning to turn on manager @entity6 and owner @entity7			1
the @entity9 club are currently 13th in the league just three points clear of the dreaded drop - zone and @entity1 have only scored 11 goals from 21 games this season			1
supporters have proposed a large - scale protest in the @entity19 of @entity19 ahead of the visit of @entity22 urging fans to leave their seat vacant for the first eight minutes , the number of years @entity7 has been in charge of the club			1
@entity26 of @entity1 blog @entity27 says supporters want their club back			1
@entity1 supporters are losing patience with manager @entity6 and owner @entity7 there ’s a saying among @entity1 fans , that you do n’t chose @entity1 , it chooses you			1
at the moment though , supporting the club feels like having to serve a sentence for a crime you did n’t commit			0
since @entity42 stormed out of the club after having drained chairman @entity7 ’s resources in a bid to reach the honeypot of the @entity47 , @entity1 have been in free fall			1
@entity42 ultimately failed , @entity7 was n’t impressed and @entity1 supporters simply suffered			1
current boss @entity6 said after @entity1 ’s last game , when responding to questions about agitated supporters calling for his head , that ‘ the expectancy levels outweigh the realism ’			1
@entity6 knows , though , considering his 41 and 38 - point season finishes and the unwanted records he ’s collected , including having the worst @entity3 record of any @entity1 manager , one thing fans have been is patient with him			1
@entity1 were beaten 1 - 0 by @entity3 strugglers @entity63 last weekend sections of the @entity1 crowd called for @entity6 to be sacked during the defeat to @entity68 's side i ’ve lost count of the number of managers local rivals @entity73 have fired during @entity6 ’s time at @entity19			1
even in the face of constant humiliation ( losing to @entity76 in a semi-final , being beaten 8 - 0 by @entity80 , suffering a record 10 home league defeats in a season , and losing six games in a row this season ) , we ’ve always hoped @entity6 could turn it around			0
with 11 goals in 21 league games our ‘ expectancy levels ’ have now dropped to praying for shots on target and maybe seeing a @entity1 goal some day			2
certainly in my lifetime , @entity1 have traditionally been considered a top - half team with ambitions of @entity98 football			2
i ’ve personally seen them win everything bar the @entity101			0
yet , as the club enters its fifth consecutive relegation battle , fans ' ambition has been dumbed down to @entity3 survival			1
tempers flared on the pitch after a bad challenge by @entity63 's @entity110 led to a red card relegation should n’t even be in an @entity1 supporter ’s vernacular , and you have to feel sorry for the younger generation of @entity1 fans who have experienced nothing but the bland decay of their beloved club			1
the overriding problem is a lack of strategic consistency			0
there was a change in transfer policy from young and hungry ( and cheap ) to low - cost journeymen , an astonishing u-turn on the exiled ‘ bomb squad ’ players			0
while on the pitch , @entity6 , recently switched to the same possession - based ethos he abandoned during his first season in charge			0
the latest edition , again offers a chronic lack of cutting edge in the final third , but hopefully the signing of @entity140 will remedy that and make the increasingly disillusioned @entity142 a threat once again			0
@entity1 have signed midfielder @entity140 from @entity144 for £ 3.25millon @entity6 attends press conference with his new signing , who he will hope can add a creative spark off the pitch , the last we heard directly from our chairman was a statement in may last year , saying he was selling the club			2
he told us : ‘ i owe it to @entity1 to move on , and look for fresh , invigorated leadership , if in my heart i feel i can no longer do the job			2
’ he ’s still the chairman , yet we have n’t heard from him since , although we are often reminded by @entity6 that @entity7 owns a telephone and television , so he knows what is happening at the club			0
but do you know he gave the @entity1 boss a new four - year contract , a mere four games after he ended the previous season with relegation form of 38 points ? it ’s baffling			2
@entity1 have only managed to scored 11 goals from 21 league games this season the new @entity1 ceo @entity173 talks about the club ’s future being in @entity98 , but increasingly - worried supporters feel it ’s more likely to be in the @entity177			2
after all , we ’ve heard the @entity98 line before from @entity181 ’s predecessor			0
the proposed supporter demonstration of vacating the @entity19 for the first eight minutes of the game against @entity22 is simply saying ‘ enough is enough ’			0
this compromised version of @entity1 ca n’t continue			0
we want to be confident of what the custodians of our club are doing			0
and most of all , we want our @entity1 back			0
