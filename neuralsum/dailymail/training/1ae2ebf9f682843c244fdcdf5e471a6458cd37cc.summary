by @entity0 last updated at 9:10 am on 27th december 2011 two solar - powered @entity2 spacecraft will fire their engines starting on @entity4 to slow into an orbit round the moon			1
the washing - machine - sized grail craft are to ' map ' the interior of the moon by scanning its gravity field - measured by its effects on the flight paths of the the two craft			1
it 's a mission that @entity2 described as a ' journey to the centre of the moon ' , and will map the moon 's interior 100 to 1000 times more accurately than any previous moon mission			1
@entity2 's grail spacecraft will fire their engines to move into orbit on @entity4 and @entity26 - the twin probes will eventually orbit at just 35 miles up and will ' map ' the moon 's gravity by measuring its effects on their flight paths the twin spacecraft have been travelling to the moon since launching from the @entity37 coast in september - a leisurely journey over a distance that took the @entity41 astronauts just three days			1
' both spacecraft have performed essentially flawlessly since launch , but one can never take anything for granted in this business , ' said mission chief scientist @entity46 of the @entity47			0
on @entity4 , one of the @entity50 probes - short for @entity50 - will fire its engine to slow down so that it can be captured into orbit			0
this move will be repeated by the other the following day			0
engineers said the chances of the probes overshooting are slim since their trajectories have been precise			0
but things could still go wrong			0
cosmic rays might interfere with the probes ' engine burn and they wo n’t get boosted into the right orbit			0
' i know i ’m going to be nervous , ' said project manager @entity65 of @entity2 ’s @entity66 , which manages the $ 496 million , three - month mission			0
the twin grail probes have been travelling to the moon since september - a journey that took the @entity41 astronauts just three days			2
the probes launched on a smaller rocket to keep costs down once in orbit , the spacecraft will spend the next two months flying in formation and chasing one another around the moon until they are about 35 miles above the surface with an average separation of 124 miles			2
data collection will begin in march			0
previous missions have attempted to measure lunar gravity with mixed success			1
grail is the first mission dedicated to this goal			0
as the probes circle the moon , regional changes in the lunar gravity field will cause them to speed up or slow down			2
this in turn will change the distance between them			0
radio signals transmitted by the spacecraft will measure the slight distance gaps , allowing researchers to map the underlying gravity field			2
once in orbit , the spacecraft will spend the next two months flying in formation and chasing one another around the moon until they are about 35 miles ( 56 kilometers ) above the surface with an average separation of 124 miles ( 200 kilometers )			2
data collection won ¿ t begin until march using the gravity information , scientists can deduce what ’s below or at the lunar surface such as mountains and craters and may help explain why the far side of the moon is more rugged than the side that faces @entity120			2
spectators on the north coast of @entity123 observing in awe as the @entity126 rocket launches towards space the probes are officially known as grail - a and @entity130 months ago , @entity2 hosted a contest inviting schools and students to submit new names			0
the probes will be christened with the winning names after the second orbit insertion , @entity46 said			0
' grail , simply put , is a journey to the centre of the moon ' said @entity140 , head of @entity2 's science mission			2
spectacular : a huge moon - shaped ball of smoke is produced as the @entity126 rocket lifts off lead scientist , @entity46 said of the mission , ' it will probe the interior of the moon and map its gravity field 100 to 1,000 times better than ever before			1
we will learn more about the interior of the moon with @entity50 than all previous lunar missions combined , ' @entity140 said			1
@entity46 , the grail mission 's principal investigator and a planetary scientist at the @entity47 , said the precise lunar gravity measurements will help her and other planetary scientists better understand how the moon evolved over the past 4 billion years			1
the findings also should help identify the composition of the moon 's core : whether it 's made of solid iron or possibly titanium oxide			1
another puzzle that @entity50 may help solve , @entity46 said , is whether @entity120 once had a smaller second moon			0
astronomers have speculated that some of the ' landmarks ' on the moon 's surface are a result of a collision with a second , smaller moon			1
knowing where the moon 's gravity is stronger will enable the @entity182 and other countries to better pinpoint landing locations for future explorers , whether robot or human			1
the gravity on the moon is uneven and about one - sixth @entity120 's pull			1
' if you want to land right next to a particular outcrop ( of rock ) , you 're going to be able to do it			0
there will be no reason to do another gravity experiment of the moon in any of our lifetimes			0
' sparks fly as the @entity126 begins its take - off ( left ) before catapulting into the sky ahead of its four - month journey @entity46 said the grail findings should eliminate cliffhangers like the @entity206 landing in 1969 by @entity207 and @entity208			1
they overshot their touchdown site in part because of the subtle gravity changes in the moon 's surface below ; they almost ran out of fuel before safely touching down on the @entity217 .			1

@entity221 spacecraft will ' measure ' moon 's gravity by its effects on *flightpaths*
@entity227 's interior 100 to 1000 times more precisely than previous missions
window into moon 's 4 - billion - year *history* - was there once a second moon ?
could help future missions land on moon - @entity207 overshot landing point in 1969 partly *due* to subtle gravity changes on surface
