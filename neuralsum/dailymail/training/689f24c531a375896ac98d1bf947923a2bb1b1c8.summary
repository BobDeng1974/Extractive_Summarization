the designs - which seek to defy the laws of physics - are among an dizzying array of weird and wonderful products that have been cataloged by an amateur historian			0
businessman @entity15 , from @entity16 , south east @entity17 , came across the unusual objects as he trawled through a collection of images spanning the last 100 years			1
the eccentric inventions of years gone by also include what appears to be an early version of a videophone - with a static photograph of the recipient of the call - and an amphibious @entity53 scooter			1
other photographs capture a not - so - portable hairdryer , a mini-submarine , a side - by - side tandem bicycle and a motorcyclist 's daring back - facing sidecar			1

going under ? looking out from a transparent dome on top of the tiny amphibious vehicle , this man looks uncertain about how ready the invention is to take to the seas on your marks , get set : a daring man wears a thick helmet and tweed jacket as he takes his position in a reverse side - car that is attached to an early motorcycle jetting off : looking sharp in a boating blazer and hat , this young man takes a spin on this amphibious vehicle - made by attaching a scooter to two floating boards			0
