the latest app that 's sweeping the web is the fiendishly addictive , and surprisingly difficult , @entity2			1
it has been designed to put your colour vision and eyesight to the test by showing boards of coloured squares			1
on each board , one of the squares is a slightly different shade of the same colour and the aim is to find this odd square by tapping it with your finger or clicking it with the mouse			1
click the @entity23 button below to play @entity24 @entity24 ( pictured ) is available for free on @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity27 and on desktop browsers			1
scores lower than 11 are poor , scores between 15 and 20 is ' lower than average ' , 21 to 30 is considered normal or average , and a score higher than 31 means your eyesight is considered great ' although the game appears relatively simple , and starts with a board of just four coloured squares , it quickly grows to a board of up to 81 squares			1
and the differentiation between the shades becomes more subtle over time			1
players get a point for every correct square identified , but if they click or tap the wrong square they lose a point			2
plus , players get just 60 seconds to find the odd square on each board before the timer runs out and the game ends			2
it was created by @entity56 - based @entity55 and is available for free on @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity27 and on desktop browsers			1
although the game appears relatively simple , and starts with a board of just four coloured squares ( left ) , it quickly grows ( right )			1
the differentiation between the shades becomes more subtle over time there are eight levels , and as a player progresses the squares change orientation or add borders to make it harder			1
on the desktop version the game lets you continue until the timer runs out , but on the mobile apps ( pictured ) players ca n't progress until they have scored more than 20 on each level there are eight levels , and as a player progresses the squares change orientation or add borders to make it harder			1
on the desktop version the game lets you continue until the timer runs out , but on mobile apps players ca n't progress until they have scored more than 20 points on each level			1
the app makers said scores lower than 11 are poor , scores between 15 and 20 is ' lower than average ' , 21 to 30 is considered normal or average , and a score higher than 31 means your eyesight is ' great			1
' ' this puzzle is designed to evaluate the quality of your colour vision , ' said the developers , but is n't intended to replace a full or partial eye examination ' this puzzle is designed to evaluate the quality of your colour vision , ' said the developers			2
' you should identify the difference , if possible , and share your result with your friends			1
' but they stressed : ' even though this test can be very accurate , it should never be used to replace a doctor 's visit			2
' [ it ] provides basic information and guideline for your eyesight and colour test , and is not intended to replace a full or partial eye examination			1
' eyesight and colour was recently linked to how we perceive the world by @entity124 , chief scientist from @entity25 - owned virtual reality ( @entity127 ) experts @entity128			1
he explained that humans only have three colour sensors , we ca n’t see infrared or ultraviolet and we have a blind spot in each eye			2
‘ our visual data is actually astonishingly sparse and even if we were able to accurately record and process every photon that reaches our eyes , we ’d still have too little data to be able to reconstruct the world accurately , ' he said			2
he used the recent black and blue / white and gold dress as an example			2
‘ our visual system takes its best guess and sends that to the conscious mind , ’ he continued			2
the blue and black ( or gold and white ) dress that sweeped the internet last month revealed just how differently two people can see the world			2
but it 's not just about lighting conditions or optical illusions - evidence is mounting that until we have a way to describe something , we may not see its there			2
ancient languages , for instance , did n't have a word for blue and scientists believe as a result our ancestors did n't notice the colour even existed			0
in 1858 @entity167 , who later became the @entity169 prime minister , counted the colour references in the @entity171 and found blue was n't mentioned at all			0
@entity172 is mentioned nearly 200 times and white about 100			0
@entity174 , meanwhile , is mentioned fewer than 15 times , and yellow and green fewer than 10			0
and blue does n't appear in @entity179 texts , the @entity180 , ancient @entity182 stories , and an ancient @entity184 version of the @entity185 , according to a @entity187 philologist named @entity188			0
@entity189 , who were the only culture that could produce blue dyes , were the first ancient civilisation to have a word for the colour blue and there remain tribes today who do n't have a word for blue , such as the @entity200 people in @entity201			0
several years ago , researchers showed some of the @entity200 tribe a circle with 11 green squares and one blue			1
the study found they could not pick out which one was different from the others , or took much longer to make sense of it			0
however , the same tribe has many different words for green			0
when they were shown squares with one green a different shade , they could pick it out immediately			1
researchers showed the @entity200 tribe in @entity201 11 green squares with one blue			1

when they were shown squares with one green a different shade , they picked it out immediately ( second top left ) ' the way that the brain compensates for the limited data it receives is by maintaining a model of the real world that it constantly updates as new data comes in			1
' and it is that model , not the real world , that you experience and trust implicitly			0
we are inference machines , not objective observers			0
he then showed a red and blue pill on hands that were shown on a yellow background to give an example of how this inference model breaks down			0
@entity124 , chief scientist from @entity128 recently used this image to show how vision is simply our perception of the world , but is n't realty			0
the pills are the same shade of grey , and the red and blue colours that people see are simply what their brains perceive , based on the rest of the information around them the colours of the pills are the same shade of grey , and the red and blue colours that people see are simply what their brains perceive , based on the rest of the information around them			1
and even when a person knows that the pills are grey , they still see them as red or blue			0
‘ your visual system is n’t interested in whether the photons coming from a tile on a random image are red or blue or grey , ' mr @entity124 continued			0
' knowing that did n’t keep anyone from being eaten by lions on the @entity287			0
what it is interested in is identifying potentially relevant features , in the real world , under a variety of conditions			0
' your visual system constantly corrects for the colours in the scene			0
it is reverse engineering reality rather than just recording it			0
the colours seen are your brain ’s “ best guess			0

free app is available on @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity27 and on desktop browsers
it starts with four squares and asks you to identify the different shade
@entity310 grows to up to 81 squares and differentiation is subtle each time
and a score of 31 or above is a considered a sign of ' great eyesight '
