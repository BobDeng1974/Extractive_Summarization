by @entity0 @entity1 has admitted he has already forgotten his time as an @entity4 player			2
the 29 - year - old spent seven years at the @entity6 before joining @entity7 on a free transfer earlier this summer			1
@entity1 only started one league game last season - though he did start the @entity11 final victory over @entity12 in may - and has revealed he has already put his time at @entity4 behind			1
hoping to kick on : @entity1 has left @entity4 for @entity7 in search of more game time no chance : @entity1 is left helpless as @entity17 score in a pre-season friendly glory boy : @entity1 celebrates winning the @entity11 with @entity4 in may ' it was not hard leaving @entity4			2
i have already kind of forgotten about it			0
it 's behind me , ' he told @entity25 ' i had many wonderful years there			0
but i am a @entity7 player now and want to focus on that			0
