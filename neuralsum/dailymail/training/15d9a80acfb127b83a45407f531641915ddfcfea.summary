@entity0 was unable to stop @entity1 losing to @entity7 after they performed poorly in the field @entity0 discusses tactics with @entity20 during their 111 run loss to @entity7 @entity0 told @entity22 : ' they 'll probably be the toughest two games of the group stage and we know they 're a good test of where we 're at			1
' if we keep testing ourselves against the best sides and learning as the tour progresses , hopefully we 'll hit our straps come the quarter - finals			1
' but i think the senior players have got to stand up , myself included , and lead the way from the front			1
' the @entity37 admitted @entity1 had fielded poorly , with @entity39 centurion @entity38 among the big - hitters dropped on saturday			1
@entity41 celebrates dismissing @entity0 for a duck in at the @entity43 ' i think we probably let ourselves down in the field - we did n't have a great day there			2
i think we needed all guns firing to chase down 340 , ' added @entity0			0
' that 's probably the most frustrating thing			0
we started a little bit slowly and a bit cold , which again has been disappointing			0

@entity7 made their highest ever one - day score against @entity1 in their @entity4 opener he added : ' @entity60 taking the second five - for on this tour has been great and @entity56 was clearly very unlucky not to get a hundred at the end , as he struck the ball very cleanly			1
' @entity7 were largely indebted to @entity65 , who hit 135 from 128 balls on his home ground			0
' it was nice , a little bit surreal and it will take time for it to sink it but it 's a great feeling to get a win first up , ' he said			0
' it 's always a little bit iffy the first game of the tournament and there were a few nerves about but it 's nice to get that out of the way			0
' everyone contributed right through the order with either bat or ball , or did something special in the field , so it 's a great feeling to get this one out of the way and hopefully we 'll take a lot of momentum through the rest of the tournament			0
