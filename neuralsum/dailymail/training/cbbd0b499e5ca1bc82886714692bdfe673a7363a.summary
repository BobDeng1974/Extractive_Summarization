professor sir @entity2 , a senior @entity3 health adviser , claims more than 20,000 lives could have been saved if ministers and the @entity6 had paid attention to alerts about higher than average mortality rates			1
in an email sent in 2010 , seen by the @entity19 , he gave the then health secretary @entity20 a list of hospitals where he warned there were alarming numbers of patient deaths			1
several of those hospitals have now been the subject of a @entity3 review into their high mortality ratios , due to be unveiled to @entity30 today			1
@entity6 medical director prof sir @entity31 is set to detail failings at 14 trusts in @entity34 thought to have been responsible for up to 13,000 excess deaths going back years			0
he is expected to describe poor care , medical errors and management blunders , suggesting that the @entity39 was far from a one - off			0
@entity41 will seize on the findings to attack @entity10 ’s handling of the health service			2
health secretary @entity45 is expected to tell mps today that at least ten of the trusts are being placed in ‘ special measures ’ , with @entity6 troubleshooters sent in to take over their management and high risk services suspended			1
in the leaked email , professor @entity2 , a former president of the @entity53 and expert on hospital death rates who now advises the government , noted mr @entity20 ’s ‘ public statements that you are dedicated to reducing death rates in @entity34 hospitals ’			1
he said he had send data identifying 25 hospital trusts which in 2007/08 had one of several ‘ mortality alerts ’ or over 150 more deaths than expected in that year			2
professor @entity2 noted that @entity68 and @entity69 , @entity70 and @entity71 trusts had had high mortality rates for around ten years - but had been deemed to have ‘ fair ’ or ‘ good ’ levels of care by watchdogs			1
saying a process of ‘ self assessment ’ used by health regulators ‘ may be fundamentally flawed ’ , he said ‘ on - site ’ inspections suggested poor standards at all three			2
‘ i realise that on - site inspections are relatively expensive but i thought that it might be possible to arrange on - site inspections for the high @entity84 [ hospital standardised mortality rates ] hospitals , ’ he added			1
@entity88 went on to be at the centre of the biggest @entity6 scandal in a generation			0
a review of deaths at @entity88 by police and other officials has identified hundreds of cases between 2005 and 2009 where poor care could have led to deaths			0
in an email sent in 2010 , seen by the @entity19 , then health secretary @entity20 was given a list of hospitals where he warned there were alarming numbers of patient deaths professor @entity2 noted that @entity68 and @entity69 , @entity70 and @entity71 trusts had had high mortality rates for around ten years - but had been deemed to have ' fair ' or ¿ good ¿ levels of care by watchdogs in all , professor @entity2 estimated the deaths at the trusts he identified amounted to 4,609 in 2007/08 and over 20,000 in total			1
in a reply to his letter , sent in april 2010 as the parties prepared for a general election the following month , a junior health minister , @entity117 , told him it would be more appropriate to take up his concerns with the @entity120			1
a @entity122 source said : ‘ this is yet further evidence that @entity20 personally had information about failing trusts which he failed to act upon			2
@entity10 claim to be the party of the @entity6 but ignoring warning signs and covering up failure lets down both the @entity6 and the patients it serves			0
’ conservative mp @entity131 tabled the questions in @entity133 suggesting more than 1,500 further representations were made to @entity10 ministers about the trusts with high death rates six of the 14 hospitals which have been subject of professor @entity31 ’s review were on the original list sent to mr @entity20 , now @entity10 ’s shadow health secretary : @entity68 , @entity70 , @entity143 , @entity144 , @entity145 in @entity146 and @entity147			1

they included over 400 letters about @entity147 , 300 letters about @entity144 and over 200 letters about @entity68			0
conservative mp @entity131 , who tabled the questions , said : ‘ @entity20 must take responsibility for @entity10 ’s record : thousands of unnecessary deaths , an appalling cover - up on his watch , and a wall of silence			2
' new evidence suggests @entity10 ignored more than 1,500 warnings about these hospitals , where there was terrible suffering and cruelty			0
' @entity20 must now apologise to the families who lost loved ones			2
he must publish the official papers he is keeping secret			0
and he must support the @entity6 reforms that the @entity122 are making , to put caring back at the heart of our @entity6			0
’ @entity10 has strongly denied putting pressure on the healthcare regulator and other @entity6 organisations to cover up bad news in the run up to the 2010 general election			0
the party is expected to attempt to blame falling numbers of staff in areas such as midwifery and a decline in meeting its four - hour @entity186 target as being responsible for some of the latest failures in the @entity6			0
a source close to @entity190 said : ‘ in every one of these hospital trusts we are seeing standards declining , not because of what @entity20 did			2
this government has spent £ 3 billion on an unnecessary reorganisation of the @entity6			0
' ‘ we will reject what is a political attempt by this government to undermine the health service			0
