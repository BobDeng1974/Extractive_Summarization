by @entity1 reporter published : 13:56 est , 1 january 2014 updated : 17:32 est , 1 january 2014 two @entity6 students married mentally handicapped @entity8 women so they could stay in the @entity8 with one being deported but the other now claiming he has a human right to family life with his young son , @entity4 judges have heard			1
the first man , who is in his 20s , began a relationship with a woman in her late teens two months after exhausting his rights of appeal			2
they were married in a @entity22 ceremony in june 2012 , but last month the judge declared that marriage a sham and the man was deported			1
in both cases , it has been claimed that the women 's disabilities meant they did not have the capacity to enter into a sexual relationship or consent to marry the second man , who is in his 30s , married a woman , also in her 30s in a @entity22 ceremony in late 2011 about six weeks after his application to stay in the @entity8 was refused by immigration authorities			1
an anonymous informant had called to tell officials that the woman 's stepfather had received £ 20,000 ' in consideration ' of that marriage			1
the woman became pregnant ' almost immediately ' and gave birth to a son in the summer of 2012			2
the man is now demanding to stay in the @entity8 , basing his claim on his right to family life enshrined in the @entity51			2
but in both cases , it has been claimed that the women 's disabilities meant they did not have the capacity to consent to marriage			1
details have emerged in written rulings published on a legal website following separate hearings in the @entity61 in @entity62			2
judges said no - one involved in either case could be named			2
in the first case , a local authority had asked mr @entity67 to make rulings about whether the teenager had the mental capacity to make decisions about her life - including the capacity to decide about entering into a ' contract of marriage '			1
mr @entity67 concluded that one of the women had the capacity to consent to sexual relations but said she did not have the capacity to enter into a marriage contact he said social workers became aware that she had begun a relationship with a @entity6 man in his 20s			1
local authority officials and police had warned that the man might commit an offence because the woman was unlikely to have the capacity to consent to sex and marriage			1
nevertheless the couple had ' entered into a purported @entity22 marriage ceremony ' at the man 's home about 18 months ago			1
mr @entity67 said the man had arrived in the @entity8 to study in 2009 but an application to stay was refused after an immigration tribunal concluded that he had submitted forged documents and attempted to deceive officials			2
' his rights of appeal were exhausted in june 2011 , ' said the judge			0
' it is in this context that he began a relationship with ( the woman ) in august 2011			0
' the judge said that days after the marriage ceremony the man had claimed asylum because ' he feared he would be killed by his family who disapproved of his marriage to a white @entity8 woman '			0
he said the man had been refused asylum and deported in august 2012			0
mr @entity67 concluded that the woman had the capacity to consent to sexual relations but said she did not have the capacity to enter into a marriage contact			1
and he ruled that the wedding ceremony she had been involved in was a ' non-marriage '			0
in the second case , a local authority had asked mrs justice @entity129 to make decisions about whether the woman in her 30s had the capacity to consent to marriage and sexual relationships			1
' a @entity22 marriage , not recognised in this jurisdiction , was performed between them , ' said mrs justice @entity129			1
' an anonymous informant had telephoned to state that the ( woman 's stepfather ) had received £ 20,000 in consideration of the marriage			1
' she said six weeks earlier the man 's application to stay in the @entity8 following the expiry of a two - year student visa had been refused			0
he had subsequently applied for ' leave to remain on the grounds of his marriage '			0
the judge said ' immigration proceedings ' were ' as yet unresolved '			0
the judge concluded that the woman lacked the capacity to consent to sexual relations and lacked ' sufficient understanding ' to consent to marriage			1
mrs @entity129 said the man was basing a claim to remain in the @entity8 on his right to family life enshrined in the @entity51			0
' the reality is that he is now relying on his married and fatherhood ... in support of his claim to remain , ' said the judge			2
' so , the reality is that whatever his original motivation , ( the woman ) is being used			0
' she added : ' ( the man 's ) position is bound to be self - serving			0
' mrs @entity129 said the case had been about the woman - not her son			0
she was told that man wanted stay in @entity182 with the baby			0
she said plans for the little boy 's care would need ' rigorous evaluation ' .			0

both women were married in @entity22 ceremonies
but disabilities meant they ' did not have the capacity ' to consent to marry
stepfather of one of the women was paid £ 20,000 ' in consideration '
