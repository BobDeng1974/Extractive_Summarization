an animal lover who lives in a remote mountain town keeps two adult lions as pets much to the annoyance and criticism of his neighbours and friends , who he says think they are just ' killers '			1
@entity9 , 53 , from @entity10 in the @entity11 , has been keeping lions since 2012 , and has done everything from nursing them back the health to playing with them in the garden			1
his neighbours and friends meanwhile have been very critical of decision to keep and raise the lions , and many others around the world have disagreed with keeping lions as private pets			1
the cub , named @entity46 , was born with deformities including a deformed spine			0
at the time , mr @entity9 was convinced that the lion cub would have died without his help			1
a short while later , lioness @entity52 , just four weeks old at the time , joined the family at their home in the @entity11			2
@entity57 - fect : the lions , such as @entity46 ( pictured ) are friendly and would never attack their owners , but they do sometimes accidentally scratch them huge : the lions have outgrown their earlier and more cub - like beginnings , but still remain just as playful and enjoy socialising with mr @entity9 and his family dangerous : sometimes the lions , during play - fighting , common among adult lions , cause their owners to suffer scratches or slight injuries mr @entity9 's daughter @entity67 with lioness @entity52			1
she explains that their relationship has changed since the lions ' childhood from friend to sometime competitor mr @entity9 remembers @entity46 's road to recovery , and especially how his deformity could have possibly killed him			1
he said : ' @entity46 was very ill and suffered from a twisted spine when he first came here - he had to spend four months in hospital			0
' but now he is in good condition and is thankfully okay			0
' i think if he stayed in the circus he would have died because they would not have been able to care for him			0
' earlier days : mr @entity9 with one of the lions during their adolescence - they have since grown to their full weight and height tiny : one of the lions as a cub , playing with a pet parrot in the garden - the lions have grown up around their human owners and so are very social with them when they were cubs , owning both @entity46 and @entity52 was like owning a pair of slightly larger housecats - but now they are fully grown , it is very different both lions are from different areas of the @entity46 ( pictured ) is a male @entity105 lion weighs 250 kg @entity46 is a male @entity105 lion weighs 250 kg , and @entity52 , a female @entity108 lion , weighs 100 kg. together they eat more than 200 kg of meat a month , which could be made up from 70 chickens , nearly an entire cow , or two whole pigs			1
mr @entity9 said : ' they eat beef , chicken , pork and the wild animals from the nearby forest			1
' also for a treat i like to give them cream and ice cream which they absolutely love			0
' together both @entity46 and @entity127 eat more than 200 kg of meat a month - the equivalent of almost an entire cow occasionally the lions will play fight together , and while sometimes mr @entity9 will join in , he has to occasionally step back as the lions might get carried away mr @entity132 believes his raising on the lions is about preserving the species - which could be in danger of becoming endangered , for future generations mr @entity9 said : ' a lot of people do n't agree with people keeping lions in private hands but i think it 's important to protect the genetic code of these animals ' while mr @entity9 treats the lions like pets , he is very aware of the dangers of keeping big cats in the garden , and deals with them on a daily basis			1
things like play fighting can lead to accidental wounds , because despite the fact that the lions are just playing , they often do n't know their own strength in relation to their human owners			1
' i 'm not afraid of them but i must respect that the lions are big			2
' ' when we 're playing together i must be attentive - but they never attack me - only little scratches that is all			2
mr @entity9 first rescued lion @entity46 when he was a cub at only seven months old , from a circus			1
he claims that @entity46 would have likely died if it were n't for his and the hospital 's care @entity52 joined @entity46 in the mini-pride months after , and they formed a tiny family of eventually massive pets ' my daughter could play with both lions when they were small but now that has changed			2
' because @entity52 now protects her pride like in the wild she fears my daughter - almost seeing her like an enemy - which is not good			0
' mr @entity9 's daughter @entity67 , who has been involved with the lions since she was young , and they were cubs , has had to adapt to how their dynamic and relationship has changed			1
she said : ' i think @entity52 remembers when she was small and we were friends			0
' we could play together go to bed and sleep together			0
moving from outside in the garden , to inside their house in the @entity11 is a slightly different transition , considering they are fully grown lions @entity46 the lion , now fully grown , can be seen with a proper mane around his neck , which denotes his maturity and dominance mr @entity9 claims that the people who criticize the lions have the wrong idea about lions , and think they 're only killers ' but now she 's became a woman and she 's jealous of me - everything has changed			1
' @entity46 is like her husband now and i 'm another woman - she 's scared of that			0
' when they were little , mr @entity9 's daughter would play with the lions and sleep in bed with the female one - but now she 's older this has gotten harder as the female lion sees her as a threat despite the criticism he has experienced from friends and neighbours mr @entity9 believes he is doing the right thing by keeping the lions in captivity			1
he said : ' most people have the wrong idea about lions , they think they 're only killers but that is not right			2
' @entity233 are social , sensitive animals and they 're great			0
' a lot of people do n't agree with people keeping lions in private hands but i think it 's important to protect the genetic code of these animals			2
' it 's about preserving this type of lion for future generations			2
' they 're very important to me - i love them so much			0
' they give me back love the love i give to them			0
it 's great for me			0
' mr @entity132 's is one of several stories featuring in new @entity257 series @entity255 which begins on thursday april 3 at 8pm .			0

@entity25 , 53 , from @entity259 in the @entity11 has raised two lions
@entity262 and @entity127 , are now fully grown , but still enjoy playing
raise the lions is *controversial* , many think they should n't be owned
mr @entity9 believes he is preserving their species for the future
despite criticism from neighbours he is *adamant* they are not ' just killers '
