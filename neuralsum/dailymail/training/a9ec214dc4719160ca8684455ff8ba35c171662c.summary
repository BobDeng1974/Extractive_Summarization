@entity2 fashion label @entity0 has been accused of defacing its store on @entity5 's prestigious @entity4 after painting one of the upstairs rooms brown			1
the leisure - wear chain met with protests when it announced it was moving to the @entity11 listed store in @entity5 's upmarket @entity12 in 2013			1
and now tailors from the surrounding boutiques have accused the brand of defacing the store after they painted a first floor room brown			1
@entity0 has been accused of defacing this @entity11 listed building on @entity4 after tailors on the exclusive street say they painted an upstairs room brown without the colour being agreed on the conditions attached to a @entity11 listed building mean that any colour scheme on the ground or first floor must be agreed with the council before going ahead ( stock images of @entity0 interior ) @entity32 ’ court was told that the conditions of @entity11 status meant that any colour scheme on either the ground or first floor had to be agreed with the council beforehand			1
court papers accuse @entity40 of breaching this condition on march 24 last year at their 3 @entity4 shop			1
protesters have long objected to the @entity44 , saying its all - american leisure clothing is out of keeping with the famously upmarket street of largely @entity49 tailors			2
prosecutor @entity51 , on behalf of @entity50 , asked for a delay so a senior barrister could review the case			0
he said : ‘ it ’s a complicated matter and needs to be looked at in the round , and which companies are the appropriate defendants			0
‘ we also need to consider the merits of the case , which involve a certain amount of artistic judgement that involves looking at the painting of walls			0
’ the fashion chain 's @entity4 store has long been the source of criticism , as people feel its all - american leisurewear is out of keeping with the upmarket , traditionally @entity49 boutiques on the street he said the barrister for the prosecution was currently ill , but added : ‘ it is hard to anticipate a trial , either the case will be withdrawn , which is unlikely , or there will be a guilty plea with potential substantial mitigation			1
’ @entity40 and @entity87 are in the dock along with with @entity90 based @entity89			2
they both face the same charge of failing to comply with a condition in a listed building contrary to the @entity94			2
if convicted , they face a maximum £ 20,000 fine			0
@entity97 adjourned the case until march 25 for further assessment of the case			0
