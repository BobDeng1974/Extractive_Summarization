by @entity1 reporter published : 23:44 est , 1 january 2014 updated : 05:34 est , 2 january 2014 ' deliberate inflation ' : @entity5 energy secretary @entity4 said the so - called @entity6 paid £ 4billion more for power than the market rate energy firms ‘ deliberately inflated ’ the price they paid for electricity from their own power stations - leaving customers out of pocket by up to £ 150 over the last three years , it was claimed today			1
the so - called @entity6 - @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 , npower , and @entity20 - paid £ 4billion more for power than the market rate , according to shadow energy secretary @entity4			1
the @entity25 politician accused the companies of paying over the odds to increase profits in other divisions of their companies or doing deals that were bad for customers			1
she told @entity34 : ‘ these figures reveal the full extent of the way consumers have been overcharged for their electricity			0
‘ energy companies always blame wholesale costs when they put up bills , but it now looks like they could have deliberately inflated prices to boost profits from their power stations			1
‘ the time has come for a complete overhaul of our energy market			1
@entity25 will break up the big energy companies , put an end to the secret deals and force them to do all of their trading on the open market			1
’ @entity25 's analysis compared the price paid for electricity by the energy giants , the weighted average cost of fuel , with the average market price a year ahead provided to them by small supplier @entity65			1
but @entity66 , which represents the big six suppliers , told @entity34 that @entity25 's research was wrong because the figures could not be compared			2
a spokesman said : ‘ it also covers losses , the energy element of reconciliation - by - difference ( @entity75 ) costs and balancing and shaping costs incurred by the supply			2
‘ the additional costs included in the weighted average cost of fuel make them a totally different figure to the basic wholesale market price			2
' @entity83 , the government 's watchdog for the energy industry , said today they were ' looking into ' the accusations , but said the energy markets were so so difficult to analyse that they could not know for sue			1
@entity88 , a senior partner at the organisation , told the today programme : ' what we identified in our recent work was that actually there is n’t enough transparency to be able to actually look at that			0
' however , he added that planned reforms to the industry would help eliminate any problems by increasing competition and removing the possibility for such loopholes			0
he said : ' we ’ve effectively created more transparency ... [ before the reforms ] there was n't enough trading going on at the point at which people wanted to buy energy			2
' we ’re making it far easier for independent suppliers to buy the electricity they need to compete with the big six			0
' the accusation from @entity25 comes as @entity116 energy secretary @entity115 called for @entity117 to be part of a fully integrated @entity120 power market to bring bills down			1
the @entity116 dismissed @entity25 's plans for a price freeze and insisted a giant network of underground and under - sea cables allowing energy to be shifted between the @entity117 and mainland @entity120 would push down prices			1
he said there was an urgent need to build a giant network of electricity interconnectors across @entity120 , allowing vast amounts of energy to be moved between countries , driving down prices - shaving a possible 10 per cent off bills			2
urgent need : energy secretary @entity115 has called for @entity117 to be part of a fully integrated @entity120 power market to bring bills down mr @entity115 told @entity142 : ‘ literally in the last three or four years , there has been a complete change in the differential between the @entity147 price for gas and energy and the @entity151 price for gas and energy			1
‘ that represents a strategic change in the terms of trade and is very significant			0
the @entity151 needs to respond to this very quickly			0
’ although there are some gas interconnectors already linking countries within @entity120 and electricity interconnectors between the @entity117 and @entity163 , the @entity164 and @entity165 , mr @entity115 called for swift action to boost the system to ensure @entity117 can compete with the @entity168 , where energy prices are far lower			2
‘ we need much better grid interconnectors around @entity120 to enable energy to flow across the @entity151			2
connecting the @entity117 with mainland @entity120 and different parts of the periphery of @entity120 with central @entity120 , ’ he told the newspaper			0
the government 's energy regulator has said that changes to energy bills coming into force today will show consumers that ' there are savings out there ' and stop them being ' bamboozled ' by complicated tariffs			1
' bamboozled ' no more : @entity88 of @entity83 , pictured , said energy market reforms would help consumers the changes brought in by watchdog @entity83 mean that a wide array of tiered plans and discounts - which often did not provide the savings people expected - have been banned			1
now energy companies are limited to offering four tariffs for gas and four for electricity , which is meant to make it easier to compare companies and access the best deals			2
hailing ' the most radical set of reforms to the retail and wholesale market since competition began ' , @entity83 senior partner @entity88 told the today programme that ' this market is getting easier and there are savings out there they can make			0
he said : ' we ’re responding to what consumers have told us			0
what they want is that combination of choice and simplicity and that ’s what we ’re delivering			0
' putting all this package of reforms together is actually about making this market much more competitive so that there ’s appropriate pressure on prices , profits and quality of service for consumers			1
' the real message to consumers today is this market is getting easier and there are savings out there they can make			0
' however , @entity83 was criticised by consumer group which ? for not going far enough to help customers			0
a statement said that the reforms are ' a welcome step in the right direction ' , but ' do not go far enough ... at a time when millions are struggling with the cost of living			0
' ‘ this is why the government should intervene with more radical measures including simpler pricing , greater transparency and scrutiny of the cost of energy policies , and the separation of supply from generation businesses			0
' more must be done to keep prices in check and give consumers confidence that the price they pay for their energy is fair			0

it 's left customers out of pocket by up to £ 150 over the last three years
@entity4 says @entity6 paid £ *4bn* more for power than market rate
firms accused of paying over odds to increase profits in other divisions
energy regulator says they are ' looking into ' accusation , but that the market is not ' transparent ' enough to know for sure
