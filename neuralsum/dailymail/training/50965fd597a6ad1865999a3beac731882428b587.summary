they gathered in the same studio to record the same song ... but what a difference 30 years makes			2
back in 1984 , the group that sang the original @entity4 ? included such global superstars as @entity8 , @entity9 and @entity10			1
today ? the new @entity11 features three social media celebrities with millions of fans on the internet – but no experience of professional singing			1
in a sign of the times , @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19 – all made famous by @entity21 – are part of the group of performers sir @entity27 has gathered around him for the project , which is raising money to help alleviate the @entity32 crisis			1

and in another modern twist , some of the biggest acts in the line - up are those made famous by reality television – such as boy band @entity70 , who were formed on @entity77 in 2010			1
they have gone on to become a worldwide phenomenon and have topped the @entity114 charts three times			0
fellow x factor star @entity78 has had four number one hits			1
elsewhere , however , the new @entity11 line - up includes 11 musicians who have never had a @entity114 number one single – a stark contrast to the original group that included members of @entity123 , @entity124 and @entity125			1
@entity96 ( centre , facing ) , one of the men behind @entity11 , directs singers ( l - r ) @entity84 , @entity94 , @entity75 and @entity74 sir @entity27 ( left ) put together the modern group , which includes reality show singers such as @entity77 runner - up @entity78 lead singer of @entity43 , @entity55 ( centre ) at a recording session for @entity11 30 , which is raising funds and awareness to combat @entity32 the new cohort does have 28 number ones between them , but half of these come from veteran stars @entity97 , 54 , @entity96 , 61 , @entity62 drummer @entity61 , 65 , and sir @entity27 , 63			1

however , their luck might be about to change – as the power of the internet has allowed do they know it 's @entity153 ? to climb the charts three weeks before it is even released			2
so many fans have pre-ordered a copy on @entity157 that it has shot to second on the shopping website 's list of most purchased singles			2
the line - up of performers on the track also includes two @entity165 rising stars who do not feature in the studio picture – 22 - year - old @entity167 and @entity168 , 23			1
the official @entity170 single has topped the @entity114 chart			0

but there is one conspicuous absence from the line - up – @entity85 , 26 , who has reportedly not been taking sir @entity27 's calls			1
the @entity202 singer , whose album 21 is one of the top - selling records of all - time in @entity165 , was said to have been asked ' hundreds ' of times , but will not appear on the track			2
according to sir @entity27 , this is because she is focusing on her family			1
he said : ' @entity85 is doing nothing			0
she 's not answering the phone			0
she does n't want to be bothered by anyone			0
' she wo n't even pick up the phone to her manager			0
she 's bringing up a family , you know			0
' the original 1984 line - up included global superstars such as @entity8 , @entity9 , @entity10 and @entity125 it 's not only the line - up that has changed since @entity11 first released do they know it 's @entity153 ? in 1984			1
the lyrics have also been altered to reflect the ebola crisis			0
the original line ' where the only water flowing is the bitter sting of tears ' has been replaced with ' where a kiss of love can kill you and there 's death in every tear '			2
the words ' well tonight thank @entity237 it 's them instead of you ' have become ' well tonight we 're reaching out and touching you ' , while the chorus is a call to ' feel the world ' and ' heal the world ' as well as ' feed the world '			0
and instead of ' there wo n't be snow in @entity247 this @entity153 time			0
the greatest gift they 'll get this year is life			0
no rain or rivers flow			0
do they know it 's @entity153 time at all ? ' , they sing ' no peace and joy this @entity153 in @entity247			0
