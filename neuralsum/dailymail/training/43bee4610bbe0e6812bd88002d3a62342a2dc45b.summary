by @entity0 we hardly ever think about it , but the @entity3 we ’re standing on rotates at around 1,100 miles per hour ( 1,670 km / h )			0
but what if that rotation suddenly stopped ? that 's what @entity8 , also known as @entity8 on @entity9 , set out to answer with his latest video			1
the @entity13 - based scientist has outlined the devastating impact that a sudden halt to the @entity3 ’s rotation would have on life as we know it			1
the gravity of the still @entity3 is the strongest at the polar regions ( shown in green )			0
it is intermediate in the middle latitudes and weakest at the high altitudes of the @entity25 , close to the equator everything would be launched in a ballistic trajectory - around 1,100 mph ( 1,670 km / h )			2
those who are somehow able to survive turning into ' supersonic tumbleweed ' would have powerful winds to content with , which could destroy everything in their path			2
meanwhile , @entity3 ’s magnetic field would cease to exist and we would be dosed with deadly amounts of ionising radiation			1
the @entity3 would become an almost perfect sphere , as the current rotational velocity causes the @entity3 to bulge out around its equator			1
on perfect sphere @entity3 , the world ’s oceans would redistribute , flooding many areas of the planet with a huge volume of water			1
if the @entity3 stopped spinning , it would take 365 days for the @entity51 to move through the sky and return to the same position			0
if the @entity3 stopped spinning suddenly , the atmosphere would still be in motion with the @entity3 's original 1,100 mile per hour ( 1,670 km / h ) rotation speed at the equator			0
@entity8 describes how most people would die a horrific death			0
‘ immediately everything that was n’t on @entity3 and was n’t safely at the poles would continue to moving as it had , ’ he explains			0
‘ it would be flung due east at 1000mph … your body would immediately become a 9inch calibre bullet			0
’ those who were somehow able to survive turning into ' supersonic tumbleweed ' would have powerful winds to contend with , which could destroy everything in their path			1
‘ gusts of wind as fast as those near an atomic bomb detonation would blast past the surface and up into the sky forming worldwide storms of unprecedented magnitude , ’ continued mr @entity8			2
‘ the friction alone , caused by the now stopped @entity3 colliding with these winds would be enough to cause massive fires and unparalleled erosion ’			2
meanwhile , @entity3 ’s magnetic field would cease to exist and we would be dosed with deadly amounts of ionising radiation			1
the @entity3 would become an almost perfect sphere , as the current rotational velocity causes the @entity3 to bulge out around its equator			2
because of the @entity3 ’s bulge in the middle , the oceans are held out at the equator by 5 miles ( 8 km )			2
on a perfect sphere @entity3 , the world ’s oceans would redistribute , flooding many areas of the planet with a huge volume of water			1
those who are somehow able to survive turning into ' supersonic tumbleweed ' would have powerful winds to contend with , which could destroy everything in their path			0
‘ gusts of wind as fast as those near an atomic bomb detonation would blast past the surface , ’ explained @entity8 if the @entity3 ’s rotation slowed to one every 365 days , a condition called ' sun synchronous ' , every spot in the @entity3 would have permanent daytime or night - time all year long			1
this is similar to the situation on the moon where for two weeks the front - side is illuminated by the sun , and for two weeks the back side is illuminated			0
if it stopped spinning completely , the world would have half a year daylight , and half a year night time			0
‘ the yearly change in the sun 's position in the sky would now be just its seasonal motion up and down the sky towards the south due to the orbit of the @entity3 and its axial tilt , ’ @entity126 said			0
‘ as you moved along constant lines of @entity3 latitude , you would see the elevation of the sun increase or decrease in the sky just as we now see the elevation of the sun change from a single point on the @entity3 due to the @entity3 's daily rotation			0
’ but while this may sound horrific , according to @entity126 , the probability for such an event is ‘ practically zero ’ in the next few billion years			1
@entity3 ’s magnetic field would cease to exist and we would be dosed with deadly amounts of ionising radiation			1

@entity8 outlines the devastating *scenarios* in his latest video
he claims everything would be launched in a ballistic trajectory *sideways*
there would be powerful winds as fast as those felt near atomic explosions
@entity3 ’s magnetic field would *disappear* *exposing* planet to deadly radiation
if it stopped turning , the planet would become an almost perfect sphere
the world ’s oceans would redistribute , flooding many areas of the planet
probability for this happening is ‘ practically zero ’ in next few billion years
