if you can hardly bear the thought of your mother - in - law coming over for lunch , look away now			1
@entity6 's biggest family gathering was held in @entity7 in @entity8 as 130 people celebrated their gene pool and enjoyed a bit of a catch - up			1
four generations of the @entity15 family travelled from far and wide to be there with some flying in from @entity17			1
we are family : 130 of @entity15 and @entity21 's descendants met in @entity8 to celebrate most of the clan live in @entity8 and @entity24 but some family emigrated to @entity26 and @entity17 in the 1800s sparking a geographical split from the herd			1
with far too many to fit inside a house , pub or any other local venue , organisers borrowed a giant marquee to house the monster celebration			2
one for the album : guests wore name stickers to identify themselves all present were descendants of @entity15 and @entity21 , who were stalwarts of the rural farming community in the 19th century and are buried in the local cemetery			1
the last family gathering of the @entity46 brood took place in 1987 but only attracted 30 to 40 people			2
originals @entity49 had nine children , who had dozens more between them , and their children went on to have scores more themselves			2
their great granddaughter @entity54 , 89 , was the oldest relative in attendance and the youngest , was six week old @entity57 's great , great , great granddaughter			1
family matters : luckily , the sun shone during the gathering in the village of @entity7 the jolly affair was organised by @entity63 , 65 , and her cousins who used genealogy records to build a family tree before sending out invites			2
she said : ' we always knew we had family overseas , it was quite common for people to emigrate from here back then			0
four generations of the @entity46 clan met in a wedding marquee because they could not fit inside a house or pub ' in my grandfather 's generation , three of five boys emigrated			0
only one of the boys lived at home the whole time			0
' some of my cousins had been meaning to have this event for a long time , and it finally seemed like the right time to do it			0
' despite the success of this meeting , they are n't planning another reunion any time soon			0
some relatives travelled from @entity17 to ensure they were there for the big day @entity63 added : ' we had a marquee from a wedding and we did a " bring and share "			1
' it was a great fun day , lots of sitting around and chatting			0
living so far apart we had lots to catch up on			0
' it 's not the sort of thing you want to do too often though - the logistics are a little daunting and the novelty would soon wear off			1
' we might do one in another 10 years or so			0
