many motorists dream of the day they can sit back and relax while their car drives itself			0
and while @entity3 and other companies are working hard to make autonomous vehicles a reality , it could take years to create a car that can negotiate complex situations on the road – including wet weather conditions			1
@entity3 ’s self - driving cars ca n’t currently cope in heavy rain or snow – or find their way around 99 per cent of the @entity16 , an insider has admitted			1
a bump in the road ? a @entity18 has admitted that the firm 's cars ( pictured ) are incredibly reliant on maps , ca n't cope with wet weather conditions and are unable to ' see ' potholes			1
all these safety concerns will have to be addressed before the technology becomes mainstream , but experts think it is only a matter of years according to @entity28 , the current prototype cars are very reliant on maps to navigate and ca n’t react like a human driver , dodging potholes and other hazards			1
@entity3 ’s cars have driven themselves over 700,000 miles ( 1,126,540km ) but they ca n’t cope in snowy conditions and can not negotiate heavy rain			1
@entity36 , director of the @entity3 car team , said this is because the detection technology is not yet strong enough to separate certain objects from weather conditions			1
while the cars ’ cameras can spot a traffic light changing , they can be confused by strong sunlight			0
@entity3 tests its cars virually ( pictured ) as well as on real roads			1
@entity3 ’s cars have driven themselves over 700,000 miles ( 1,126,540km ) - but there is still a long way to go to hone the technology in the @entity16 , driverless cars are only allowed on roads in certain states if someone sits in the driver 's seat			1
the @entity59 is expected to start granting licences to certain driverless cars and their human co-pilots as soon as this month			2
changes to the @entity65 @entity64 , which dates back to 1968 , are also afoot			0
it used to state : ' every driver shall at all times be able to control his vehicle or to guide his animals			0
' an amendment agreed in may would allow a car to drive itself , as long as the system ' can be overridden or switched off by the driver '			0
a driver must be present and able to take the wheel at any time			0
the convention covers @entity81 countries , @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity84 and @entity85 , although not the @entity16 , @entity86 or @entity87			2
they do n’t distinguish between an empty plastic bag - which could be easily driven over - or a rock , so cars must drive around both			2
they also ca n’t detect uncovered manholes or potholes			0
mr @entity36 told the publication : ‘ i could construct a construction zone that could befuddle the car			2
’ the cars ‘ see ’ pedestrians as moving blocks of pixels and know to stop , but unlike a cautious human driver , they could not spot a traffic policeman at the side of the road , waving for traffic to stop - which could lead to trouble			2
despite the cars being allowed on public roads , they need to prepare to set off in more detail than a human driver , because a precise map must be created of exactly where to go – and a car can not deviate from its route			2
an area has to be mapped multiple times by a sensor vehicle to record details such as driveways , in order to make the cars ' routes			0
these details then need to be pored over metre - by metre by humans and computers , in a much more labour - intensive process than in needed to maker @entity128			0
despite best efforts , routes can lack details such as temporary traffic lights that have been installed , or if there are road works or potholes to avoid , which the car might drive over			0
in addition , maps have only been made for a few thousand miles of road , so in order for the cars to roam the @entity16 , @entity3 would need to pour a vast amount of resources into mapping the rest of the vast country , down to the tiniest changing detail			1
the company is working on ironing out all these problems			0
for example , if a @entity3 car notes new lights and street signs , it sends a message to update the mapping software			1
@entity3 unveiled a compact version of its car without a steering wheel , but it will now have to re-introduce the wheel to comply with the @entity59 ’ new regulations			2
despite all these set - backs , mr @entity36 said autonomous cars will ‘ happen more quickly than people think ’ – perhaps as soon as in five years ’ time			1
@entity3 said its current cars ca n't drive in snow ( stock image ) and heavy rain			1
experts say this is because the detection technology is not yet strong enough to separate certain objects from weather conditions the prototype two - seater cars have buttons to autonomously begin and end the drive			1
the car makes turns and react to other vehicles and pedestrians based on computer programs that predict what others might do , and data from sensors including radar and cameras that read in real time what other objects are actually doing			0
the route might be set by typing a destination into a map or using spoken commands according to @entity36 , the leader of @entity3 's self - driving car team			1
the car will be powered by electricity and could go about 100 miles ( 160 km ) before charging			0
its shape suggests a rounded - out @entity203 - something that might move people around a corporate campus or congested downtown - with headlights and sensors arrayed to resemble a friendly face			0
the front of the vehicle has a soft foam - like material where a traditional bumper would be and a more flexible windscreen , in a bid to be safer for pedestrians			0
in these prototypes speed is restricted to 25mph ( 40 km / h ) and the ability to self - drive will depend on specifically designed @entity3 road maps tested on the company ’s current fleet of vehicles			1
ultimately the vehicles will be faster and will be able to use @entity3 's extended maps service			1
driving works by using gps technology to locate the vehicle ’s exact position on an electronic map			0
a combination of radar , lasers and cameras sitting on top of the roof give the car a 360 - degree ‘ view ’ , with sensors linked to computer software able to ‘ see ’ and identify people , cars , road signs and markings and traffic lights .			2

@entity3 's autonomous cars ca n't navigate 99 *%* of the @entity16 , an insider said
current prototype is very reliant on maps and ca n't react like a human
cars are n't driven in the rain or snow as detection technology ca n't distinguish between *droplets* or *flakes* and *obstacles* on the road
despite current pitfalls , @entity36 , director of the @entity3 car team he believes the cars will be fully functional in five years
