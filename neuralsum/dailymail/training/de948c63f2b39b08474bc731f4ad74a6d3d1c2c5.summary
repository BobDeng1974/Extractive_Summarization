having tried for a baby for seven years , @entity0 and @entity1 were heartbroken when two expensive rounds of @entity4 failed to yield a pregnancy			1
but determined to try and have child , they decided to opt for one more cycle - this time , with a twist			2
the couple asked for a special procedure they had read about in the hope it might give them the son or daughter they had dreamed of			1
the technique involves using a special adhesive to fix the couple 's embryo to the wall of mrs @entity24 's womb			1
and to their delight , this resulted in the birth of @entity29 - may , described by her parents as their ' little miracle '			2
@entity0 and @entity1 , 34 and 47 ( left and right ) , finally achieved their dream of being parents after seven years of trying			1
their daughter @entity38 ( centre ) after surgeons used a special adhesive to attach an embryo to the wall of mrs @entity24 's womb before @entity43 ( pictured ) was born , @entity42 and mrs @entity24 had endured two failed attempts of @entity4 , which had cost them £ 10,000 mrs @entity24 , 34 , of @entity46 , @entity47 : ' we 're so happy			1
i did n't think it would work but i 'm so glad it did			0
@entity29 is everything we wished for			0
' all i wanted was to be a mummy , but there were so many problems to sort out			0
now she 's here , we 're so happy			2
' mrs @entity24 was told to lose weight to help her conceive and mr @entity1 , 47 , a self - employed builder , was advised to take a variety of vitamins and minerals such as zinc to give his low sperm count a boost			1
but they also received the advanced glue treatment before @entity29 was born in july			1
mrs @entity24 said : ' my embryos were dipped in glue and the lining of my womb was scratched so that everything would implant			1
' as the lining heals , doctors think it helps to keep the embryo safe and in place			2
' mr and mrs @entity24 started trying for a baby in 2007 , two years before they married , but when nothing happened after a year , the pair went to see the doctor			1
' a test revealed that @entity1 's sperm count was desperately low and i was told that my @entity87 was too high , ' mrs @entity24 said			1
' it was a shock to find out that @entity1 had problems and i did n't know just how serious being overweight was in terms of becoming a parent			1
@entity93 has been used in a handful of fertility clinics since 2012 , but is unknown to most couples struggling to conceive			0
it is usually used as a last resort after couples have tried two rounds of @entity4 without success			0
in the final stages of their third course of @entity4 , the embryo is dipped in a strongly adhesive gluey substance prior to being put back into the womb			1
it sticks to the side of the mother 's womb , increasing the chance of implantation of the embryo to the uterus			1
the product , which doctors describe as working like ' superglue ' , is made with naturally occurring ingredients			0
it also supports embryo development as it is enriched with nutrients and energy sources			2
research has shown that using the glue increases birth rate by eight per cent			1
dr @entity125 , embryology manager at @entity126 , @entity127 , said : ' there are lots of new ways for us to be able to maximise the chances of a pregnancy following @entity4 and it seems that @entity135 and @entity0 have used all of them at once , which is quite unusual			1
' @entity93 is a natural substance we use to help ' super glue ' the embryo in place and it seems to have done the trick this time			1
' ' my @entity87 was 36 and that was way too high and i was advised to get it down to 31 , which meant losing about three stone			1
' before the first @entity4 effort , i had lost a stone			0
i was feeling quite hopeful			0
' @entity1 had managed to produce some healthy sperm and we were positive			1
' but two attempts ended in failure and the couple were devastated			2
mrs @entity24 said : ' we decided to have one last attempt at @entity4			1
we were offered a new treatment in which the embryos are incubated in a different way			0
' we just wanted it to work			0
we would have done absolutely anything to have a healthy baby			2
' a new video technique to monitor embryos was used and mrs @entity24 was given the glue to help the embryo implant in the womb			1
she said : ' i was so nervous because i knew we 'd done so much this time			0
if this attempt failed , i knew we would be in serious trouble			1
the chances of having a baby would be zero			2
' two weeks after treatment , a pregnancy test confirmed she was pregnant			0
' i cried and cried			0
it was a dream come true			0
all i ever wanted was to be a mum			0
@entity1 was completely overwhelmed , too , ' mrs @entity24 said			1
' i think it was 6am when we did the test			0
i had n't slept a wink			0
' we waited until i was 13 weeks ' pregnant before we told our family			0
' everyone was so thrilled for us			0
our parents had been so supportive			0
all we wanted was to tell them we were having a baby			2
' it had taken us seven years to get pregnant			0
i never dreamed it would be such a long journey			0
' @entity29 was born on july 14 , 2014			1
she weighed a healthy 7lb 10oz			0
' she was adorable and we were the proudest parents , ' mrs @entity24 said			1
' everything we 'd been through seemed like a distant memory			0
' when i held her in my arms , i cried with joy			0
@entity1 cut her cord and it was wonderful			1
' one day , we 'll tell her just how special she is			0
but for now , all i 'm interested in is having some special time with my family			0
' mr and mrs @entity24 , were unable to get @entity4 treatment on the @entity202 because they did n't meet the criteria			1
mrs @entity24 was delighted when baby @entity38 was born			1
' she was adorable and we were the proudest parents , ' mrs @entity24 said , ' everything we 'd been through seemed like a distant memory ' two weeks after the procedure in which mrs @entity24 's fertilised embryos were dipped in special glue , a test confirmed she was pregnant			1
pictured is a scan of @entity213 - may they decided to fund private treatment themselves by missing out on holidays and trips out to save the cash to pay for treatment			1
they had two failed attempts , costing a total of nearly £ 5,000 each before the final successful effort which cost more than £ 7,000			0
self - employed builder mr @entity1 worked extra hours to help raise the money and family members also chipped in to help them			1
' @entity228 was never an issue we said that would give ourselves the best hope of having a baby no matter what it cost , ' mr @entity1 said			1
' we went without holidays and stopped going out as much			0
we just said " it 's either a holiday or a baby " - and it was no contest			2
' ' there was a lot of tears and heartache after the first two attempts failed			0
we had decided that with the third attempt it was all or nothing			2
' we 've gone through a lot over the last six years , but it has all been worth it in the end and we have our perfect little girl , ' mr @entity1 said ' basically we were given a list of the things we could do to give us a better chance and the price list			1
' @entity0 had been all internet forums and discussion groups and everybody was saying how successful the ' glue ' option was so we asked for that as well			1
' when @entity0 did her first pregnancy test and it was positive we did n't dare believe it			2
' during that week she must have used seven or eight pregnancy testing kits and we still did n't really believe it until the first scan confirmed she was pregnant			0
' we 've gone through a lot over the last six years - particularly @entity0 , but it has all been worth it in the end and we have our perfect little girl			2
