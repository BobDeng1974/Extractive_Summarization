@entity0 looks fantastic in wellies — and so does my 14 - year - old niece			1
so why do i always resemble a flat - footed troll when i pull on my ancient black pair ? according to @entity7 , founder of fashion brand @entity8 , my mistake is that my welly wardrobe is woefully out of date			1
‘ choosing the right pair of rubber boots is as important as finding that perfect leather pair , ’ she says			2
‘ all of us want wellies that make us feel good , especially in a long winter			1
’ so wellies , it seems , are no longer just a practical choice for country walks and gardening			1
they can be fashionable , too			2
newly informed , here is my pick of this winter ’s selection on the @entity25			2
are they mad ? but that ’s what @entity33 has come up with this autumn			2
the towering rubber boots , which raise you 4in above the mud , are surprisingly flattering and make feet look tiny and almost cartoon like			2
that ’s something your average welly never does			2
but i felt self - conscious in them and they ’re not very comfortable because my foot slid forward			2
in fact , they made me totter , so i did n’t risk a dog walk			1
if you ’re planning to stride out in these at @entity51 next summer , let ’s hope the heels do n’t get stuck in the mud			2
2/5 @entity57 quilted wellies , £ 60 , @entity58 if , like me , you get chilly feet then this faux fur lined pair are a canny choice			1
though cosy , they ’re elegant and sturdy enough for a country romp			0
i love the chestnut brown colour and the quilted upper fits snugly			0
looked great with jeans , skirts or dresses			1
5/5 floral calf wellington boots , £ 13 , @entity71 bring a splash of colour to jeans or trousers			0
they hit mid-calf , which is not flattering with skirts , but are snug on the foot			0
good value , though the rubber is quite thin and wrinkles when you walk			1
4/5 original tall wellingtons , £ 90 , @entity28 favoured by the fashion set , they make short legs look elongated			1
a little loose , but stylish			0
4.5/5 polka - dot mid-calf welly , £ 36.95 , @entity89 playfully natty , they ’re comfy and good for walkers			1
overall , very pleasant to wear			0
4/5 @entity93 rain boots , £ 45 , @entity94 - store.com a fun colour , but do n’t reach very high , so my feet looked long and my legs stumpy			0
2/5 black rider wellington boots , £ 40 , @entity100 a welly that looks like a winter boot			0
a smart choice for trudging to work			0
4/5 @entity107 wellies , £ 39.95 , seasaltcornwall.co.uk flattering length , good fit and the washable red laces are stylish			1
they look good with a skirt			1
5/5 heeled welly , £ 35 , @entity114 a welly with a wedge seems absurd , but i loved this shiny pair			0
the wedge is comfortable and acts as a bouncy shock absorber			0
they have an excellent grip in a muddy field			0
4.5/5 @entity126 leopard - print rubber wellies , £ 35 , @entity127 the print is bang on trend and looks great with jeans			1
go down a size for the best fit or wear thick socks			0
wide at the top , but adjustable			0
3.5/5 biker wellies , £ 55 , @entity136 @entity138 and pink zip detail show potential , but they are not chunky enough to pass as a biker boot			1
they are rather dainty looking at the front with a pointed toe and the heel is too low , so i felt flat - footed			0

wellies are no longer just for gardening and walking the dog
they are now a fashion *statement*
@entity0 looks great in wellies and so does @entity154 *'s* niece
so why do hers never quite look as good ?
