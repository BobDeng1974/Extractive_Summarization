it was the only way to make money			0
what else could i do ? i ca n't read or write - my family did n't send me to school - so this was the only way , ' she said			2
she had initially planned to give up the disguise as soon as her daughter married , but unfortunately her son in law fell seriously ill shortly after the wedding and was unable to seek employment			0
as time went by she grew to enjoy spending time around men and drinking at the local male - dominated cafes without suffering she kind of sexual harassment she claims she would have experienced if she was living openly as a woman			0
despite this , @entity17 says she never actually lied about her gender and never denied being a woman if she was asked			0
