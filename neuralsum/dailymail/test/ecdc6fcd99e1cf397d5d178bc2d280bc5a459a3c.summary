@entity0 has ended speculation over his next opponent by announcing he will fight former light - welterweight world champion @entity3 on may 30			1
the @entity5 fighter had earlier this week come under increasing pressure to take on @entity8 rival and @entity10 welterweight champion @entity9 in june			2
however , @entity0 , who was also linked with bouts against @entity12 and @entity13 , said he was already deep in negotiations to fight somebody else			1
@entity0 ( left ) has announced his next fight will be against @entity3 at welterweight on may 30 @entity0 's ( right ) last fight came against @entity19 in december , whom he beat to take his record to 30 - 3 @entity3 ( left ) lost his last bout against @entity22 in november - his first defeat in his professional career @entity3 was knocked down six times en route to a heavily lopsided points loss in @entity28 and on his wife 's @entity30 channel @entity0 announced : ' the next opponent will be @entity3			1
i will be taking that fight at 147lbs ( the welterweight limit )			0
' the fight has yet to be rubber - stamped , but @entity0 added : ' i 'm looking forward to getting this fight announced officially by my manager and advisor @entity39			2
' ( his management team ) think it 's the right fight for me , they want to keep me going			0
' @entity3 's only defeat in his 21 - fight professional career came in his last bout against @entity46 superstar @entity22 , who faces @entity47 in a mega-fight on may 2			1
@entity3 was knocked down six times en route to a heavily lopsided points loss in november last year			2
yet @entity0 believes his @entity53 foe is a credible opponent as he wrested the @entity56 light - welterweight title off the much feared @entity57 in june 2014			2
@entity0 said : ' you can class him as an @entity60 opponent			0
' he has fought decent opponents , beaten decent opponents , and just fell short against @entity22 , which is an a star opponent			0
' he 's a decent boxer overall			0
he knows how to box and knows how to move well			0
he takes a decent amount of shots and he 's got a decent amount of power , so i think overall it 's going to be a good fight for me			0
' the 28 - year - old hopes to fight in @entity74 's home city of @entity75 , with @entity0 's only previous outing there an 11th - round stoppage of @entity78 at @entity79 in may 2010			1
@entity12 ( right ) had been relentless in calling out of @entity0 since his comfortable win over @entity81 @entity0 ( pictured in march 2014 ) hopes to fight @entity3 's home city of @entity75 next month @entity0 ( right ) has fought once before in @entity75 - where he defeated @entity78 in may 2010 this time , though , @entity0 wants the non-title bout at the @entity84 as he said : ' we 're looking at fighting in @entity75 , i think @entity75 's a great venue for me			1
' having that fight in @entity75 will be good for the @entity8 fans in a way because it will give them a chance to travel and it wo n't be as far as going to ( @entity93 ) vegas			2
' this time i 'd like to fight at the @entity84 , which i 've never fought at			0
' @entity0 has made no secret of his desire to chase lucrative showdowns against @entity47 or @entity22 and is confident a win over @entity74 can lead him to that			1
' hopefully this can lead me on to the bigger fights in the future , which is what i 'm looking at , ' he added			0
but @entity0 's announcement has left @entity10 welterweight champion brook disappointed			2
@entity106 's @entity9 retained his world strap with a four - round destruction of @entity109 a week ago and immediately called out regular verbal sparring partner @entity0			1
the two have spent the week trading barbs - with @entity9 offering a june 13 date at @entity113 for an all - @entity8 bout - but @entity0 made it clear he was going his own way when announcing his next opponent on thursday			1
the @entity5 man said he will face @entity3 in @entity75 on may 30 and @entity9 can not understand the move			1
after @entity9 's victory over @entity109 on march 1 , he called out @entity0 in a post-match interview @entity0 has previously refused a fight with @entity9 , but now promises it will take place within 12 months ' if someone said to me you can get five million quid , a world title , fight at @entity113 with a fight that every fan wants to see , it 's a no - brainer for me , ' 28 - year - old @entity9 told @entity132			1
' he 's fighting @entity3 who did n't win a round against ( @entity22 ) @entity22 , a feather puncher , not a big puncher			1
it does n't make sense to me			0
' i 'm world champion , i 'm calling him out , we want the fight , there 's a word title and a bagful of money and it does n't make sense that he 's fighting this guy who 's bringing nothing to the table			0
' he 's said he 'll fight me before but when it comes to it , i do n't get why he does n't want to fight me			0
yes ( i feel frustrated ) , wherever i go it 's always @entity0 , when are you going to fight him ? ' he 's delicate around the whiskers , he knows i 'm a big strong welterweight and he knows i 'm coming for that chin of his			2
' @entity0 hit back on @entity157 , though , saying : ' seems to me @entity158 is dying to fight me for the big pay day before he faces a half decent opponent and loses that @entity10 title			0

@entity0 will fight @entity3 in @entity75 next month
@entity0 has won 30 bouts - *including* victory over @entity19 last year
