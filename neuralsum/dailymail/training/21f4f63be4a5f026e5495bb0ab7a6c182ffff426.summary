by @entity0 published : 18:09 est , 4 october 2012 updated : 01:48 est , 5 october 2012 the @entity2 hands out 25,000 contracts a year that can help its workers pay less tax , mps reveal today			1
the off - the - books arrangements create ‘ suspicions of complicity in tax avoidance ’ , according to commons spending watchdog @entity8			0
the workers include 4,500 presenters and backroom employees paid through ‘ personal service companies ’ that allow them to limit substantially their tax liabilities			1
arrangement : @entity2 stars @entity21 and @entity22 have both set up private service companies in order to be paid , but said that it was not their choice			1
the @entity2 is reported to hand out 25,000 contract a year so its stars can pay less tax that figure – revealed by the @entity2 last night – is much higher than previously thought and covers 400 stars paid at least £ 50,000 a year			1
of these , 148 are news presenters such as @entity21 and @entity22			0
treasury chief secretary @entity31 told the @entity32 he expected the corporation to take ‘ swift and decisive action ’ to address public concern about the tax arrangements			1
thirteen thousand of the off - the - books contracts are for on - air roles			0
the @entity2 stressed that most are normal freelance contracts , rather than personal service company deals			1
the corporation , which said the 25,000 figure includes individuals with multiple contracts , has launched an internal review into the issue , while insisting it has done nothing wrong			0
shock : @entity8 said that the practice happens in other public sector areas and is almost always ' staggeringly inappropriate ' but mps last night said they were shocked by the scale of the issue at the @entity2			2
in a damning report , the commons public accounts committee said it was alarmed the @entity61 could not ‘ provide any assurance that these individuals are paying the correct amount of tax ’			1
mrs @entity8 , the chairman of the committee , said the practice , which has been uncovered elsewhere in the public sector , ‘ generates suspicions of complicity in tax avoidance and fails to meet the standards expected of public officials ’			2
the @entity71 mp added : ‘ we were shocked to discover that the @entity2 has about 25,000 off - payroll contracts			2
some 13,000 of these are for individuals who are on our screens and on the radio every day			0
they are the public face of the @entity2			0
‘ avoiding tax and national insurance when paying public sector staff is almost always staggeringly inappropriate			2
‘ the public sector must maintain the highest standards of propriety in its employment practices if it is to show leadership in the fight against tax avoidance			0
’ mr @entity31 ordered a crackdown on the use of personal service companies in the public sector after it emerged that 2,400 senior civil servants were employed in this way			1
as an independent organisation , the @entity2 is beyond the scope of the @entity98 review , but mr @entity31 has written to the @entity61 ’s new director - general @entity99 asking him to follow suit			1
he told the @entity32 : ‘ we took swift and decisive action to improve tax transparency in central government			0
i see no reason why , just like we have in central government , the @entity2 should n’t be able to provide assurance that its employees are paying the proper amount of tax and @entity111			1
the @entity2 is beyond the scope of a treasury review into the practice but mr @entity31 has written to the new director general @entity99 asking him to crack down on personal service companies ‘ with a new broom at the top of the @entity2 there is an opportunity to look again at this issue			1
i look forward to seeing the findings of their review			0
’ so far the @entity2 has moved just two workers on to its payroll as a result of its investigations			2
those employed through personal service companies are responsible for ensuring they pay the right amount of tax and national insurance because it is not deducted from their salary at source			1
unlike normal freelance contracts there is no liability against the @entity2 if a mistake is made			0
mps heard evidence that the @entity2 requires some on - screen stars to set up these arrangements – a claim disputed by the corporation			2
treasury chief secretary @entity31 told the @entity32 he expected the @entity2 to take ' swift and decisive action ' to address public concern about the tax arrangements the @entity2 denies that the arrangement reduces its tax bill or that of top stars			1
it claims the practice is standard in the industry and reflects the fact that many presenters have other outside earnings			0
the commons inquiry was launched in the wake of controversy over @entity163 boss @entity162 ’s employment through a personal service company without tax being deducted			1
following a review , the @entity98 disclosed in may that more than 2,400 @entity168 staff , each earning more than £ 58,200 a year , were being paid directly and without @entity171 deductions			1
but the public accounts committee warned that the @entity98 ’s review of off - payroll arrangements had been ‘ limited ’ because it did not cover the wider public sector like local government , the @entity177 or the @entity2			0
mrs @entity8 said the committee suspected ‘ many individuals and employers in local government and in the health service do not pay their proper tax and national insurance contributions ’			0
in a statement last night the @entity2 said : ‘ we note the conclusions of the @entity188 report and will respond to the points raised as part of our detailed review of tax arrangements			2
’ a spokesman added : ‘ the @entity2 pointed out that this relates to 25,000 contracts and not 25,000 people , and that in many cases an individual – such as an occasional contributor to programmes – could be issued with a contract each time he or she is booked to appear			0
’ mr @entity22 has said it was not his choice to be paid through a private service company			0
the @entity207 presenter insisted the @entity2 had ‘ required me to form a company if i wanted to continue to present @entity207			2
it claimed it had been told to do so by the @entity209 ’			0
@entity210 presenter miss @entity21 said she had formed a company because ‘ it was a stipulation laid down by the @entity2 ’			0
last year tax inspectors launched just 23 investigations into breaches of the law surrounding personal service companies – down from more than 1,000 a year a decade ago .			1

workers paid via personal service companies include 4,500 presenters and backroom staff with 400 paid at least £ 50,000 a year
@entity224 say they are alarmed @entity2 could not offer assurance stars are paying correct amount of tax
treasury chief secretary @entity31 writes to director general asking them to crack down on practice
stars say they were forced to form companies
