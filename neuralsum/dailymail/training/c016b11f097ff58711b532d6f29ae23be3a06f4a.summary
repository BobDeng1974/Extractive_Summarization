the search giant bypassed privacy settings built into @entity13 's @entity20 web browser on @entity21 , pcs and @entity23 , according to a recent report			1
other advertising companies , and @entity7 , reportedly used a similar method			0

@entity3 allegedly circumvented the protection to build up profiles of web users , using a ' cookie ' that collected advertising information			1
the move has caused outcry among privacy advocates			0
it comes shortly after @entity40 privacy groups wrote to the search giant to ask it to ' halt ' a new privacy policy that would allow it to ' share ' customer data between services such as @entity47 , @entity48 and @entity49			1
@entity3 allegedly used a ' trick ' which sends a blank message to the browser to make it accept unauthorised ' cookies '			1
@entity13 says it is ' working to put a stop ' to the practice			2
the code was uncovered by a @entity58 researcher @entity57 and was reported in the @entity59			0
@entity3 has since disabled the code , and claims that the report is in error , and that its cookies only collected anonymous information			2
the revelation caused outcry among online privacy advocates			0
@entity69 's @entity68 says , ' coming on the heels of @entity3 's controversial decision to tear down the privacy - protective walls between some of its other services , this is bad news for the company			1
' it 's time for @entity3 to acknowledge that it can do a better job of respecting the privacy of web users			1
' @entity3 says that the report was in error			2

last year , we began using this functionality to enable features for signed - in @entity3 users on @entity20			0
' to enable these features , we created a temporary communication link between @entity20 browsers and @entity3 ’s servers , so that we could ascertain whether @entity20 users were also signed into @entity3 , and had opted for this type of personalization			0
