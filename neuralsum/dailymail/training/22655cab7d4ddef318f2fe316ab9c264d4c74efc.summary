@entity1 died in a house fire sparked by a model of fridge that had a long history of safety problems ignored by the manufacturer , an inquest heard today a father died saving his children from a blaze caused by a fridge - freezer that the manufacturer knew was a potential fire risk , an inquest heard yesterday			1
@entity1 , 36 , passed his baby daughter to a neighbour but was overcome as smoke filled the family home			1
his wife @entity20 , a paediatrician who was on maternity leave , was left in a coma for two weeks but survived along with their three - year - old daughter , who had been pushed out of a window on to a flat roof by her father			2
mrs @entity20 told the inquest that there had been a problem with the @entity32 fridge - freezer icing up days earlier but she had not had time to call the manufacturer			1
if @entity32 had sent her a recall notice about the model – linked to several house fires over the previous seven years – the tragedy would not have happened , she said			1
investigators found the fridge ’s manual open at the page containing contact numbers			0
they discovered that the fire in november 2010 was caused by a fault with the defrost timer mechanism			2
@entity32 , one of @entity49 ’s largest white goods brands , had been aware of a problem with components as far back as 2003 but failed to rectify it , @entity47 heard			2
in 2007 independent testing firm @entity53 recommended a product recall but its conclusions were rejected by @entity32			0
@entity53 later amended its rating of the dangers from ‘ serious ’ to ‘ moderate ’ meaning no recall was required			0
@entity59 had written to @entity32 following a number of fires on similar fridges , but the @entity64 firm recalled the model only after mr @entity1 ’s death			1
the @entity68 software engineer was pulled unconscious from the blaze at his home in @entity71 , @entity72 but died eight days later			1
in a statement read to the inquest , his wife said : ‘ since @entity1 ’s death i am aware that @entity32 issued a voluntary recall of the relevant fridge - freezer models			1
‘ had i received notice of this recall i am adamant that i would have acted immediately and contacted the manufacturer			0
’ @entity83 @entity82 heard that the fire was caused by a faulty @entity32 fridge freezer , which the company knew had defects dr @entity88 said that the fridge - freezer ‘ had been playing up a bit ’ , adding : ‘ i did not think it was anything serious			1
‘ i had got the appliance manual out ready to call up to ask about it but did not get round to it because i was ... busy with my new baby			0
‘ as food was not spoiling i did not think [ it ] an urgent issue			0
’ @entity99 , @entity32 ’s managing director between 2002 and 2010 , confirmed that despite receiving some 15 reports of fires caused by appliances between 2003 and 2006 , the firm did not feel the fault was serious enough to warrant a recall			1
he told the coroner that @entity32 did not believe lives were at risk but admitted ‘ that may have been the wrong view in hindsight ’			2
he said : ‘ i had no particular concern around the fires reported to us at that time			0
some were component faults where there had been smoke or the smell of smoke , but nothing so dramatic			0
’ last night @entity32 issued a statement saying none of its current range of appliances is affected by the issues surrounding this case			0
the firm urged anyone with a pre- 2007 model to check its website http://refsafety.beko.co.uk to see if their product is affected			0
