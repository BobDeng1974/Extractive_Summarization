by @entity0 published : 02:45 est , 10 october 2012 updated : 07:01 est , 10 october 2012 it 's been in need of a roof to protect it from the elements for 328 years			0
and now @entity5 in @entity6 has finally got some respite with an art installation inspired by @entity10 's wet summer			1
the exhibit , a canopy of 45 colourful umbrellas suspended within the castle 's walls of @entity16 's , will keep visitors to a historic tower under cover for the first time since 1684			2
it is the first time the medieval tower has had any kind of covering since an explosion blew off the roof in that year			0
under cover : @entity27 and @entity28 from @entity29 stand inside a new art installation called @entity31 inside @entity5 in @entity6 umbrella art : the installation was inspired by @entity10 's wet summer the umbrellas are hung level with the walk around the ramparts of @entity5 so that views over the city of @entity6 are not interrupted			1
@entity27 , site manager at @entity5 , said : ' the idea came out of the rather damp summer that we 've had , when someone joked that it would be wonderful to have a huge umbrella over the open courtyard - and then we started thinking about what else could be done with umbrellas			1
' we found some pictures online of streets in @entity50 that had been covered with suspended umbrellas and realised that the quatrefoil shape of @entity5 would lend itself to such a display fantastically			2
' ms @entity27 added : ' the tower was used as a store for gunpowder and munitions in the 17th century and , on april 23 , 1684 , an explosion blew off the roof and the floors , leaving just the shell that you see today , so it has been over 400 years since the tower last had any kind of roof covering			0
' the @entity31 will remain in place until sunday october 21 , weather permitting			0

temporary : the umbrellas are hung level with the walk around the ramparts of @entity5 so that views over the city of @entity6 are not interrupted the @entity31 will remain in place until october 21 , weather permitting			1
@entity5 is all that remains of @entity5 , originally built by @entity78 downpour : the umbrellas would have come in handy when the area surrounding the tower flooded two weeks ago			2

the temporary art installation within the walls of @entity5 in @entity6 was inspired by our wet summer
