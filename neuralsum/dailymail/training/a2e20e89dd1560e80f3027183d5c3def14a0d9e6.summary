by @entity0 published : 18:38 est , 16 september 2013 updated : 08:32 est , 19 september 2013 @entity1 says he was given a new lease of life by a hip operation			2
following the surgery , he took up rambling in his 60s and now , aged 75 , regularly covers five miles a day			0
but little did he imagine that having prosthetic hips - the most common orthopaedic operation in the @entity10 - could drastically reduce his options for cancer treatment and even his chances of survival because radiotherapy beams bounce off the implant			1
fortunately , new technology offered him an alternative			0
' prostate cancer is the most common male cancer and the challenge for treatment is that it occurs in the area where many men have metallic implants ' the former plumber was diagnosed with prostate cancer three years ago			1
' prostate cancer is the most common male cancer and the challenge for treatment is that it occurs in the area where many men have metallic implants , ' explains dr @entity32 , consultant oncologist at the @entity33 in @entity34			1
' this is something we see on a fairly regular basis , as around 30,000 men have hip replacements every year in the @entity10 and one in nine of all men will develop prostate cancer			1
' implants pose problems when patients need radiotherapy			1
this is because the metal or ceramic devices either block the path of the radiotherapy beam , preventing it from hitting the cancer , or they deflect the radiation to other parts of the body , damaging healthy tissue and organs			1
@entity1 , from @entity34 , was faced with this problem after a routine check - up led to his cancer diagnosis			2
he had both hips replaced in his late 50s , after years of crouching and bending under appliances took theirs toll on his joints			2
' my new hips gave me a new life , ' says @entity1			2
' i joined the @entity68 with my wife , @entity69 , and we became regular ramblers in our local group			0
' then at the age of 70 , @entity1 had a general health check at his gp surgery			0
this included a @entity78 test , a blood test to measure levels of a protein called prostate specific antigen ( @entity78 )			0
high levels of @entity78 may be a sign of prostate cancer risk			2
his first @entity78 result was normal , but when the test was repeated 18 months later , it was slightly raised for his age , at 6.3 ( for men aged 70 and above , any result over five is considered elevated )			2
for another 18 months , @entity1 had further tests and when his @entity78 rose above seven , he underwent a biopsy			0
he was diagnosed with locally advanced prostate cancer , which means the disease had not spread beyond the prostate but was sufficiently aggressive to need treatment			1
source of the problem : x-ray of human pelvis showing double hip replacement ' even though i had been through three years of @entity78 tests , you are never prepared to hear you have cancer , ' says @entity1			2
' it was a big shock			0
' as he discussed the different treatment options with his doctor , @entity1 discovered the implications of having artificial hips			1
' surgery was not recommended for two reasons , ' says dr @entity32 , his oncologist , who specialises in prostate and other cancers affecting the pelvic area			2
the prostate is surrounded by a capsule made of fibrous tissue and although the cancer had not spread beyond the prostate , it was close to the edge of the capsule			2
' this meant that if surgery was chosen , there would be a high risk of leaving cancer cells behind			2
and we also take mr @entity1 's age into account			0
' furthermore , his cancer was deemed too aggressive for brachytherapy , where radioactive seeds are implanted directly into the cancerous areas of the prostate			2
@entity136 , where the treatment is delivered by a machine , was the only option for a cure left - but this presented a challenge			2
' if you imagine the pelvis area as a circle , the prostate is in the middle with the hips on either side , ' says dr @entity32			1
' so the hip prosthesis is very close to the area of treatment , about 5 - 10cm from the prostate			1
' it is not just this proximity - it is the fact that the prosthesis lies directly in line with the prostate , which makes it hard for the radiotherapy beams to reach without hitting metal			1
' beams ca n't go through metal			1
this means there is a risk that the patient wo n't get the right dose			0
also , if the beam hits the metal , it will bounce off in an unpredictable direction , with a risk of seriously harming nearby organs , such as the bowel and bladder			1
' the same problem exists whether the artificial joint is made up of metal or ceramic material or a combination of both			0
' the prosthesis lies directly in line with the prostate , which makes it hard for the radiotherapy beams to reach without hitting metal			1
' women with a hip replacement who develop uterine or cervical cancer as well as men and women with bladder cancer can also have problems			1
together , these cancers affect more than 20,000 people every year and , like prostate cancer , often strike around the same time as hip replacements are undertaken			0
so @entity1 's only option would have been hormone treatment , drugs that block testosterone , which fuels prostate cancer			1
however , it does not cure the disease and is on average only effective for 18 to 24 months			0
@entity1 was able to benefit from new technology that made curative treatment a safer and feasible option			0
@entity211 is based on delivering radiotherapy using the same sort of machine as a ct scanner			0
@entity34 's @entity33 is one of a handful of @entity10 cancer centres to have a £ 4 million @entity211 machine ( others are found in @entity221 and @entity222 )			1
treatment is delivered through a device shaped like a ring doughnut			0
the patient lies in the middle of the ring and beams can be aimed from every part of the ' doughnut '			0
' this is a really important development for people with prosthetics and pelvic cancer , ' explains professor @entity235 , consultant clinical oncologist at the @entity236 , @entity237 , and spokesman for @entity239 on radiotherapy			1
' with a traditional machine , we are delivering the radiotherapy beam from five or six fixed positions			0
' @entity211 is a type of arc therapy , which means rather than working with a small number of fixed positions , beams are directed from all positions and angles in the arc			0
' it means the radiotherapy beams are able to reach the tumour more easily , without hitting metal , and avoiding the risk of harm to nearby areas			1
' radiotherapy is involved in the cure of half of all patients with cancer , many of whom will not need surgery or expensive drugs , ' says professor @entity235			1
' although the initial investment in the machine is high , that machine will then treat 30 patients a day for ten years			0
' adds dr @entity32 : ' a 78 - year - old today may be playing golf and have ten to 15 years ahead of them			0
we need to have curative options for these patients that do the least amount of harm and @entity211 is ideally suited to do that			0
' this group of men aged 70 and above who want active treatment for prostate cancer , rather than management ( meaning limited survival ) , is growing by 10 to 15 per cent a year , says dr @entity32			1
' older men should not be afraid to ask : “ are there any other options for me ? ” ' says @entity296 @entity10 's director of policy and campaigns , dr @entity295			1
@entity1 completed his treatment 18 months ago , which involved 37 consecutive days of radiotherapy			1
' the only side - effect i had is needing the toilet urgently and more often because the treatment irritated the bladder , but that 's settled down , ' he says			0
' i 've got a good quality of life and feel in good health			0
of course , i wanted to have an option that actually treated and cleared my prostate cancer so i can put it behind me			0

prosthetic hips can drastically reduce options for cancer treatment
radiotherapy beams bounce off metal implants
and cancer occurs in the area where many men have these implants
prosthetic hips are the most common orthopaedic operation in the @entity10
