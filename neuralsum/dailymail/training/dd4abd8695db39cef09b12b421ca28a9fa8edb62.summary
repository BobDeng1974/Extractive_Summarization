the minister urged people to report unreasonable applications of the law to the new ' myth busters ' panel at the @entity70			2
the panel has ruled on more than 220 cases since being launched earlier this year in a bid to improve the reputation of health and safety laws , which have been tarnished by years of abuse			1
among the absurd cases which the @entity70 denounced were pubs which refused to offer glasses with handles , and a restaurant removing toothpicks from its tables			2
one school banned shredded paper from the lucky dip stall at its fete for ' safety ' reasons , while a hotel chamber maid refused to make up a cot bed on similar grounds			0
