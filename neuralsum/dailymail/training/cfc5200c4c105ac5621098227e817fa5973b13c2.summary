therapy traditionally consists of sitting on a comfortable sofa while pouring your heart out to a counsellor			0
but in this digital age , online therapy is just as beneficial - if not more so - than conventional therapy			0
according to a new study from the @entity10 , therapy sessions carried out online have become increasingly common in recent years			1
death of the therapist 's couch ? a new study found that online therapy is more effective than the traditional face - to - face kind many sites , like @entity18 and @entity19 , have created a network of therapists who use instant messages , emails and even video chats to help their patients			1
to investigate how effective this method was , researchers asked six therapists to treat 62 patients suffering from moderate depression			0
after being randomly divided into two groups , one was treated online - through email or instant messenger - while the other received face - to - face therapy			1
both groups received eight sessions consisting of cognitive therapy techniques			0
speaking about the results , professor @entity39 said : ' in both groups , the depression values fell significantly			0
' online treatment : researchers put its success down , in part , to the paper trail it generates			2
fifty - three per cent of those treated online were no longer diagnosed with depression , compared to 50 per cent of those who had face - to - face therapy			1
during follow - up sessions , it was found that rates of recovery among those treated online were higher than the patients who saw counsellors in person			1
at the end of the study , 57 per cent of patients who underwent online treatment were free of depression , compared to 42 per cent of those who had traditional therapy			1
researchers put the online success down , in part , to the paper trail it generated			2
patients were able to re-read the correspondence with their therapist , keeping it fresh in their mind , whereas those who had real - life therapy quickly forgot advice given			2
@entity39 added : ' in the medium term , online psychotherapy yields even better results			0
' our study is evidence that psychotherapeutic services on the internet are an effective supplement to therapeutic care			0

@entity10 found *virtual* therapy more successful than face - to - face sessions
fifty - seven per cent of online patients *completed* course depression free
only 42 per cent of cases who saw therapist in person felt better
down to paper trail : online subjects looked over notes from time to time
