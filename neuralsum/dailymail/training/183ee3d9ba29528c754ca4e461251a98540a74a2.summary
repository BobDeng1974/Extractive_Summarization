it was the second failure of the system to circulate seawater to cool spent fuel rods at the plant in the past three weeks			1
@entity18 ( @entity18 ) said it was alerted by an alarm that the cooling system for the no 3 reactor had shut down at around 2.27pm ( 5.27am gmt ) after a power board failed			1
safety alert : workers at @entity4 's @entity3 nuclear plant lost the ability to cool fuel rods in reactor 3 ( seen here after the earthquake in 2011 ) after tripping the power supply while setting up a rat trap crippled : the plant was the site of the worst nuclear disaster since @entity36 in march 2011 when a magnitude - 9 earthquake triggered a tsunami that destroyed back - up generators at @entity3 technicians fixed the problem by about 5.20pm , the utility said			1
@entity18 said workers appeared to have had inadvertently caused the power outage when they were trying to install a net to keep small animals from crawling into the reactor building			2
a rat caused a power outage at @entity3 last month when it triggered a circuit breaker by bumping into exposed wires			0
in that case , the cooling system was shut down for almost a day			0
workers appeared to have had inadvertently caused the power outage when they were trying to install a net to keep small animals from crawling into the reactor building the utility has faced a range of problems with controlling ground water and maintaining the massive cooling system built to keep the reactors stable			2
the plant was the site of the worst nuclear disaster since @entity36 in march 2011 when a magnitude - 9 earthquake triggered a tsunami that destroyed back - up generators at @entity3 and disabled the plant 's cooling system			0
three of the reactors melted down			0
work to decommission the plant is projected to take decades to complete .			0

system went down for three hours at 2.27pm ( 5.27am gmt ) today
