published : 08:48 est , 11 november 2013 updated : 08:49 est , 11 november 2013 we all have memories of twisting pipe cleaners together as children to make stick - figure animals			1
however one woman has taken the hobby to a whole new level by turning the fuzzy sticks into extremely detailed models			0
@entity10 , an artist from @entity11 , has managed to make life - like animals using nothing but pipe cleaners , felt - tip pens and a few plastic buttons			1
these incredibly detailed animals are made by @entity10 using only pipe cleaners and strictly no glue , as she considers it cheating			1
the wolf mask ( left ) , which she made for @entity23 , has a mouth that moves when the wearer talks while the red fox ( right ) has realistic fur thanks to the pipe cleaners ' texture this is an okapi , a deer - like mammal from @entity32 , which was made only using the cleaners , including the stripes around the legs her most impressive creation is a full - sized wolf mask she made for @entity23 with a moving mouth			1
@entity10 , from @entity11 , makes the pipe cleaner animals in her workshop and has been practicing since she was 12 @entity43 said : ' i gave it complete whiskers and made the jaw able to move when the wearer talks			1
unfortunately , i put off sewing and colouring the faux fur until the very end , so it ended up a bit sloppy			0
but the neighbors ' reactions were priceless			0
' in fact several of her works are able to move about thanks to special hinges woven into their bodies , and the flexible material they are made from			0
@entity43 has a passion for animals , and uses her hobby to make sculptures of some of her favourite exotic and endangered species			2
she has woven animals from @entity73 , deer - like mammals found in @entity32 , to a @entity75 , the world 's largest carnivorous marsupial which is thought to be extinct , though sightings are still reported across @entity79 , @entity80 and @entity81			2
she has even made @entity82 , the wolf - like incarnation of ancient @entity85 sun goddess @entity86 from the video game @entity88			0
writing on her blog about one of her wolf sculptures , she says : ' i never use glue ( to me that is like cheating ) , and only occasionally use scissors			2
a little bit of marker colors the eyes , mouth , and paw pads			0
' @entity43 builds a basic skeleton from chenille stems , the technical name for pipe cleaners , before gradually building up the layers by weaving others on top to create the full sized sculptures			1
wolves are a favourite subject fro @entity43 , from @entity11 , and this starved creature is just one example this miniature of a wildcat has whiskers made from stripped - down wire and looks especially life - like while perched among this ivy @entity43 constructs skeletons made either from pipe cleaners , for the smaller pieces , or wire , for the larger pieces such as the wolf mask ( bottom left ) and then builds layers of the furry brushes on top because of their furry texture , the cleaners make an ideal material for weaving animals as it gives their coats a realistic texture			1
she also uses stripped down wires to make whiskers , with projects lasting for anything from a few hours for small , basic animals , all the way up to several months for the larger beasts			2
discussing her technique when making a model of a @entity143 , a nocturnal fox found in @entity145 , she said : ' it â€™s mostly hollow , just the legs , head , and tail tip are solid			0
while @entity43 says she sometimes uses beads for the eyes and felt pens for the markings , she refuses to use glue and considers it cheating the animal enthusiast enjoys making exotic an endangered animals including these two fennecs , a type of nocturnal fox from @entity145 @entity43 holds herself to a very high standard and says she was ' no pleased ' with this sculpture because of his ruffled fur ' usually the more detail required , the tighter an area becomes			1
' i generally use the most common pipecleaner size , around 6mm wide , 12 inches long , found in most stores			0
' i sort of just smooth them down with my fingers so the wires do n't show , and they are tightly woven together			0

@entity10 , from @entity11 , weaves animals out of pipe cleaners
the sculptures take an average of *40* hours to make
she refuses to use glue as she considers it cheating
created a full - size wolf mask for @entity23 this year with moving jaw
sell work online but does n't say how much each creation costs
