@entity0 may have been described as the ‘ @entity2 @entity1 ’ but many believe ' @entity4 ' – the new @entity2 prime minister 's partner for 20 years – is the true radical			1
@entity8 , who is the mother of his two children , encouraged the 40 - year - old to enter politics when he was apparently more into sport			2
they were fellow engineering students and miss @entity8 convinced him to join the @entity17 in 1990 despite his middle - class background			1
the new prime minister has deliberately kept his family out of the limelight as he led his anti-austerity @entity36 party into power			0
but many believe the strong willed @entity4 , who has been at his side for more than 20 years , may become the power behind the throne			1
mr @entity0 was born into a bourgeois family and before meeting miss @entity8 was more interested in sports than politics			2
then a knee injury kept him out of sport			0
that coincided with him meeting miss @entity8 , a fellow student who convinced him to join the @entity17 in 1990			2
a year later , when the students of @entity23 revolted against unpopular education reforms , the pair , as leaders of the movement , led protests at the @entity55			1
changing direction : a knee injury kept mr @entity0 out of sport at the same time as he met miss @entity8 , a fellow student who convinced him to join the @entity17 in 1990 couple : mr @entity0 and ms @entity8 got together in 1987 when they were at high school together in @entity23 pupils ate and slept at the school and mr @entity0 told an interviewer at the time : ‘ we want the right to judge for ourselves whether to skip class			1
’ they both went on to attend the @entity68 and became engineers			0
according to friends from the @entity72 , where miss @entity8 graduated in electrical engineering , she is strong - willed , militant and dynamic			0
she once took one of her professors to court when he tried undermine her work on a doctoral thesis , it was reported by the @entity2 reporter			2
she also hates spending hours shopping and does n’t like going for regular trips to the hairdresser			0
miss @entity8 avoids the media spotlight and the couple have made very few public appearances			0
they live in a flat in a seven - storey apartment block in @entity91 - a modest , working - class area of @entity23			1
@entity93 : the ramshackle block of flats where @entity0 and his partner , @entity96 , an electrical and computer engineer , live with their two children in one of the most densely populated areas of @entity23 new home : the couple will now have to get used to the opulent surroundings of the @entity104 wave : new prime minister @entity0 on the steps of the century - old official residence in @entity23 once a brash motorbike - riding @entity17 activist , mr @entity0 preferred to take advantage of the cohabitation law that has been in effect since 2009 rather than get married at the courthouse or the church			1
the unconventional political leader - regarded as a true man of the people – takes out the rubbish , is an avid football fan and puts their boys , @entity121 and @entity122 , to bed			1
his youngest son ’s middle name is @entity126 – a tribute to @entity1 , one of his idols			0
there will be one major change , as the family swaps their modest working - class home for @entity23 ' @entity135 palace			1
with its grand portico and white marble columns , the opulent @entity104 has been the official residence of @entity2 prime ministers since 1982			1
it could be a culture shock for a leader who has lived so far as a man of the people			0
avoiding the perks of political life , mr @entity0 still opts to get around on a motorbike , flies economy and has never been seen wearing a tie			0
in the weeks before sunday ’s momentous election , the question of whether he would opt to wear a tie as prime minister was widely asked			0
invariably mr @entity0 replied no , ‘ after all , ’ he joked ‘ i did n’t wear one to see the @entity152			0
’ right behind her man : mr @entity0 , followed by his partner @entity8 ( @entity4 ) @entity21 , greets his supporters outside @entity36 's headquarters after his party 's win in sunday 's general election fighter : as the excitement of his election win dies away , the @entity36 leader will face a battle against the @entity166			2

@entity96 has been @entity0 ' partner for more than 20 years
she urged sporty , middle - class new *pm* into hard - left student politics
they joined @entity17 in 1990 and led student protests
pair raised children @entity121 and @entity122 in working - class @entity23 flat
now they will swap it for the opulent @entity104 in @entity2 *capital*
it wo *n't* faze @entity183 , an engineer who shuns *glitz* and hates shopping
