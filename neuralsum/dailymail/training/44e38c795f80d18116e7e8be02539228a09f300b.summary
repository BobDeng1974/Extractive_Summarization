by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 13:10 est , 22 february 2013 updated : 18:02 est , 22 february 2013 @entity2 has passed an ' historic ' bill making it legal to play online poker within the state and with other players across the country			1
the legislature , @entity10 , was passed unanimously in both the @entity11 and @entity12 on thursday before it was signed into law by governor @entity14			1
while the legislation ruled that interstate gambling is now allowed , players from across the country will only be able to play legally once @entity2 makes agreements with individual states			1
the federal @entity21 has previously cracked down on sites that let people illegally gamble across states , but @entity14 said he was confident @entity2 was on firm legal footing			1
' historic day ' : @entity2 gov. @entity14 , surrounded by state lawmakers in the state 's @entity27 , signs @entity29 legalizing online gambling in @entity2 on thursday on thursday , he promised to communicate with the @entity21 on the language of the agreements made between states			1
exactly how the federal government will react to the legislation following its major crackdowns on online gambling sites in the past is yet to be seen			2
in april 2011 , the @entity38 and @entity39 shut down three of the biggest internet poker sites and charged the owners with fraud , money laundering and illegal gambling			0
the poker companies - including big sites such as @entity47 , @entity48 and @entity49 - were all based overseas and argued they operate outside the reach of @entity52 law , but 11 defendants were accused of the charges			0
should online poker be legalized in every state of @entity52 ? the @entity2 bill had been declared an emergency measure and the process had been somewhat hurried as @entity2 rushed to beat @entity61 @entity60 , who could sign a similar legislation next week			1
@entity29 keeps @entity2 at the front of the gambling market , legalizing online gambling for the first time in the state and potentially netting it millions of dollars in licensing and other fees			1
' this is an historic day for the great state of @entity2 , ' @entity14 said , flanked by state lawmakers			2
' today i sign into law the framework that will usher in the next frontier of gaming in @entity2			0
' @entity14 , a former chairman of the @entity78 added , ' this bill is critical to our state 's economy and ensures that we will continue to be the gold standard for gaming regulation			0
' the @entity85 had previously made gambling across state lines illegal , but in 2011 the @entity88 ruled this only applied to sports betting			0
law : the bill makes interstate online poker legal for the first time - once other states compact with @entity2 new frontier : the bill will change the landscape of gambling and some fear the impact on smaller casinos the ruling put @entity2 in position to legalize internet gambling if the federal government sanctioned it - but when those efforts failed in @entity106 , @entity14 said @entity2 would work toward agreements with other states			1
for the bill to reach its potential , @entity2 still has to convince other states to partner with it , but officials are reportedly confident that this will not be any issue			2
partnering with other states gives @entity2 an expanded customer market and provides other states with @entity2 's expertise in gambling regulation			1
@entity122 , a lobbyist representing the @entity123 , said expanding the customer base was key			0
' it 's imperative for the success of this that we compact with other states because we do n't have a universe of players , ' @entity122 said			0
the benefit for other states , he said , is @entity2 's ' most mature regulatory infrastructure '			2
' we have the most mature financial , auditing and collection capabilities , much greater than some of those states , and they have the players , ' he said			0
beating him to it : the bill was rushed through in @entity2 after @entity61 governor @entity60 , pictured , indicated he could sign a similar legislation next week @entity144 , chairman of the @entity145 , said the state already has about 20 applications from operators , equipment and software vendors to be licensed for online gambling			1
one assemblyman , @entity153 , voted for the bill but voiced his concern for smaller casinos in @entity157 , @entity158 and @entity2 's outback who could be hurt by the bill , the @entity152 reported			0
' the smaller casinos in the state , especially in @entity2 , which are already hurting , ' he said			2
' i 'm hoping this is actually going to be beneficial to them and pick up some new ( business )			0
i just wanted to get on the record that is my concern , for the little guy in this whole argument			0
' but supporters of the bill argued that those casinos too will have the opportunity to enter into agreements with compacts in other states the bill means @entity2 beat @entity61 , its @entity180 casino rival			1
gov. @entity60 had previously vetoed an online wagering bill but indicated he may sign an amended version next week .			0

state legislation signed on thursday legalized interstate gambling
players throughout the country will only be able to play online poker once their states enter agreements with @entity2
regulators now coming up with parameters of these agreements
@entity10 was rushed through as @entity61 *threatened* to beat them to it
