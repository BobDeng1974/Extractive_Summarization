he failed to win over the public at the tempestuous meeting , held at @entity45 on the street , and was interrupted regularly			2
from the outset , audience members turned up with banners reading ‘ @entity50 , we do n’t want you filming here ’			2
one furious resident said : ' do you realise the stigma that you are bringing on a community ? for you it ’s a six - to - eight - week project - for us it will go on for a generation			0
do you appreciate that ? ' filming has been taking place over the last few months , with the production company saying the show will ‘ reflect the honest experiences of people who have settled in the @entity22 and [ have ] come to consider it as home ’			1
local @entity69 said she saw people being filmed outside the centre and one of them had ‘ quite distinctive @entity74 markings ’			2
@entity10 , @entity11 , where the show is based and filming has taken place for the past few months more than 200 locals attended the meeting last night and tv show producers were routinely heckled and booed she said : ' i personally think you chose that particular person because you wanted to incite some racial disharmony in the community			1
' but mr @entity26 responded : ' we are not cherry - picking vulnerable individuals and we are not here to cause racial tension			2
' @entity10 was picked by @entity13 to be the focus of the programme , which is due to be aired on @entity19 next year			1
@entity26 , creative director for @entity13 , told the audience the show 's name conveyed the message it was an area ' transformed ' by immigration over several decades mr @entity26 said the name , which is still a working title , conveyed the message that the street had been ‘ transformed ’ by immigration over several generations			1
any resident who was filmed would have a chance to see the footage before it was used , and he denied residents were offered cash to take part			2
several times , he was asked what it would take for the company to decide not to continue filming the programme			2
but mr @entity26 said he was not in a position to cancel the programme or make changes as it would be a joint decision between @entity13 and @entity19			1
he said : ' what we wanted to do with this series is find a street and we found @entity10 in an area which over the years has been transformed by immigration			1
' what we ’re not doing is saying that everyone who lives in it is an immigrant			0
' what we wanted to do was to observe and reflect who lives in one street			1
' @entity131 mp @entity130 was one of the politicians who had urged @entity13 to stay away when the plans were first announced			1
he addressed the meeting , organised by @entity135 ’ association , and urged @entity13 to think again			1
speaking afterwards , he said : ' i think the meeting showed that this company has picked the wrong community			2
' residents have said they want nothing to do with this and they really ought to listen to that			0
' two senior @entity145 city councillors - @entity146 and @entity147 - also addressed mr @entity26 at the meeting and urged him to listen to the residents			1

@entity155 , 58 , a social worker from @entity156 , said : ' this is a multicultural community that has a lot of culture , passion and harmony			0
' this would evoke all sorts of emotions nationally and bring up the old chestnut of immigrants coming to our country and taking our jobs and houses			0
' @entity172 , 34 , a marketing consultant from @entity10 , added : “ i think it ’s really disgusting			2
it ’s not a true representation of what the local community is about and it is just a commercial move to get more viewers			0
' a local speaking at last night 's meeting			2
many who attended voiced strong opposition to the show mr @entity26 told @entity185 he was invited to the meeting but there had been a gathering before that and he felt ' people had been a bit whipped up to not really listen '			0
he also completely rejected claims the show was inciting racial disharmony			1
@entity16 is not the first @entity13 show to attract controversy			1
its predecessor @entity18 was a five part series first aired in january 2014 which provoked hundreds of complaints to police , broadcast watchdog @entity201 , and @entity19			2
among them were claims it portrayed criminal activities , foul language and misleading portrayals of those on benefits			0
some critics labelled it ‘ poverty porn ’ and said it painted a false picture of life in modern @entity22			0

the show even attracted fierce political debate and was the subject of the prime minister 's questions in early january			0
@entity19 was criticised for demonising those living on the breadline , while some of the residents claim they were misled into appearing			0
' i genuinely do n't understand that			0
one , why would we even want to do that , and two , how would we ever be allowed to do that ? ' there are places in the country that if that was our intention we could have filmed a neighbourhood a lot less harmonious , a lot less cohesive			0
' it just seemed that a lot of people were n't prepared to listen to that so really our hope is that people will start to listen			0
' he said production for the tv show will continue			0
he added : ' my hope that the misinformation that is out there can be corrected and that was the hope of the meeting last night			0
that we can try again			0
' @entity19 is screening the show sometime next year and a spokesperson said claims of racism were ' pure fiction '			0
' we understand immigration is a much debated issue which is why @entity19 , as a public service broadcaster has a duty to explore it and not shy away from difficult subject such as this			0
' anyone who does not want to be in the series wo n’t be but we intend to continue to film with residents who are very happy to share their experience of living on @entity10			1
