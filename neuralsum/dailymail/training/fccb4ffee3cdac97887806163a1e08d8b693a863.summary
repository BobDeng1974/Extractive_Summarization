the @entity133 graduate had been described as a polite and intelligent man whose interest in infectious disease was inspired by a family tragedy , according to former classmate @entity138			0
silent killer : the germ that @entity10 had been studying is known to cause inflammation of the bloodstream and meningitis ' it really troubles me thinking about it , ' @entity138 told the @entity147			2
' it 's really sad to hear about him passing away after he wanted to follow that dream			0
' the 25 - year - old 's death is being investigated by the @entity85 , the @entity152 , the state @entity153 and the @entity155			2
