by @entity0 published : 00:03 est , 21 september 2013 updated : 18:00 est , 21 september 2013 one yankee drugs cheat stole the spotlight from another on the day he announced his retirement			1
in a sequence of events almost too bizarre to be true , @entity5 hit his 24th career grand slam to pass @entity11 legend @entity10 on the all - time list and set a new record only hours after admitted drugs cheat @entity15 announced his retirement from baseball			1
despite all three holding major records and having @entity20 caliber careers , only one was never called a cheat – and he was n’t in pinstripes friday night			0
alone at the top : @entity5 watches his record - breaking home run up to the plate with the bases loaded in a tie game in the bottom of the seventh inning , @entity5 mashed the first pitch he saw from reliever @entity32 for a grand slam home run			1
the shot was his 24th career home run with the bases loaded , passing @entity10 ( who has 23 such homers ) to go into first all - time			1
it also gave the @entity11 a badly needed 5 - 1 victory over the defending @entity42 champion @entity40			2
@entity5 has a penchant for stealing others ’ spotlights			0
in 2004 , during the middle of the first @entity42 won by the @entity48 since 1918 , the shamed slugger shocked the sport by opting out of his then - record $ 250milloin contract with the @entity11			0
only hours before , mr @entity51 announced his second retirement from baseball			2
having retired after the 2010 season to spend more time with his family , the admitted @entity55 user came out of retirement prior to the 2012 season			0
mr @entity51 pitched 15 of his 18 seasons with the @entity11 , the other three with his hometown @entity63			1
his 255 career wins place him among the all - time greats , but it 's his playoff resume that turns heads			0
hangin'em up : @entity15 announced his second retirement at a friday afternoon press conference at @entity70 with 19 postseason wins , he is the career leader – by a wide margin			1
these wins were against great teams playing at their peaks , remarkable by any measure			0
he is considered one of the greatest pitchers of his era , but will never make it to the @entity20 – instead eventually fading into obscurity with mr @entity5			2
after admitting to using @entity55 during the 2004 season to heal an elbow injury , @entity15 likely sealed his fate despite having better career number than several pitchers enshrined in the @entity87			2
never needed help : @entity10 never used drugs , and played until @entity90 - eventually named after him - robbed him of the strength needed to play , and then eventually his life while @entity15 has been allowed to go out on his own terms , @entity5 still has a legal battle ahead of him			1
an arbitrator ’s hearing scheduled for sept 29 looms large , and could force him into retirement whether he ’s ready or not			0
a 39 - year - old fading slugger suspended for 211 games does not return to baseball			0
while @entity15 ’s story comes to an end , @entity5 ’s is long from over .			1

@entity5 hit his 24th career grand slam home run , breaking a tie with @entity10 for 23
earlier in the day , @entity11 pitcher announced his retirement after 18 seasons with the @entity11 and @entity63
mr @entity15 has also *previously* admitted to using @entity112
