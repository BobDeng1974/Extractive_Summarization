' @entity9 will be taken care ( of ) at home in @entity23 , ' her brother , @entity24 , wrote in an e-mail to supporters			2
' we just wanted you to know that this would n't have been possible without your help			0
' bitter battle : @entity9 , centre , is on breathing tubes following a seizure from a brain tumour , but her parents will not allow her to be removed from the tubes ms @entity9 had told her parents and the doctors : ‘ i want to die			1
’ but because her parents are deeply religious and belong to a @entity40 in @entity20 , they believe that allowing her daughter to choose death over life is a sin			1
a judge at the state appeals court yesterday sided with ms @entity9 after the rift with her parents led to an agonising legal battle for the family			1
but 24 hours later , she signed over her decision - making abilities to her father , rev. @entity51 , according to @entity52			2
he is certain to keep her on life support for as long as possible , as he believes that if she removes her breathing tube she will have committed suicide , which he regards as a sin			2
ms @entity9 , a 28 - year - old former bank manager from @entity57 , said the decision would allow her ' to make peace with my @entity60 '			1

she is paralysed from the neck down due to the tumour on her brain stem			1
ms @entity9 ’s father is @entity86 reverend @entity51 , and practices out of his church in the @entity71 neighbourhood of @entity20			1
his congregation flocked behind him to pray for ms @entity9 and tell her of @entity60 's plans for her life			1
the sin of suicide , they said , would condemn their daughter 's soul to hell			2
the difference in beliefs led to an emergency end - of - life hearing at the hospital , with the two sides bitterly re-affirming their respective stances			0
smiling : ms @entity9 had worked as a manager at @entity107 and lived in @entity10 meeting : on october 1 , there was a press conference at @entity79 to inform the media of @entity9 's condition speaking on behalf of ms @entity9 , dr @entity112 testified that the patient ‘ consistently asks that her breathing tube be removed			1
’ however , @entity116 and his wife argued that their daughter is heavily medicated , and is not lucid enough to make the life - or - death decision			0
doctors said that her medications , including morphine and an anti-anxiety medication , are not strong enough to cloud her judgment			0
ms @entity9 ’s troubles began last year			1
before her illness , she worked as a manager for @entity107 , living and working in @entity10			0
she was also training for the famous @entity57 marathon			0

but ms @entity9 was devastated when she was diagnosed with a tumour in her brain stem			1
though she received chemotherapy and radiation , the treatments did not successfully target the tumour , and last month , she had a seizure that eventually left her paralysed			2
ms @entity9 had apparently talked to nurses at @entity79 about removing the tubes , but her parents interceded			1
offering support : members of the congregation in ms @entity9 's room , praying for her to be healed full of life : @entity9 pictured before her illness a facebook page entitled @entity149 cited a passage from the @entity151 , which reads : ‘ ” for i know the plans i have for you , ” declares the @entity155			1
“ plans to prosper you and not to harm you , plans to give you hope and a future			0
” ’ a post from reads : ‘ we can see @entity60 ’s powers working every day and know that @entity60 has a plan for her too ! ’ children from the congregation have written notes of encouragement for the 28 - year - old , with one writing : ‘ i hope you feel better			0
i miss you , @entity171			0
’ @entity172 , as well as religious differences have come to play in ms @entity9 ’s case			1
@entity175 said : ‘ in @entity177 culture ... we believe that the decisions that the parents make have a lot more influence in this type of matter			2
’ words of love : young members of the church offered kind words to ms @entity9 , calling her ' @entity171 , ' and pleading with her to come back soon ‘ the role of religion in medial decision making really pertains to the patient , ’ @entity189 , @entity190 , the director of @entity191 , told @entity192			2
‘ if the patient is capable of making her decisions , then that ’s where we would honour			0
’ dr @entity202 added that while it may be heart - wrenching for the parents to face , she said the goal of bioethics is to bring the families together			0
‘ the question is not whether she ’s going to die , it ’s how she ’s going to die			0
‘ there ’s nothing worse than losing a child , ’ she said , ‘ but there are limits to medical treatment			0
there are many things we can not fix , we can not perform miracles			0
’ dr @entity202 said that there are some practices that could help ms @entity9 ’s parents come to terms with their daughter ’s illness			1
‘ these are religious people , and they know we are all mortal , ’ she said			0
‘ being clear about that can maybe help decrease their suffering			0

@entity9 , 28 , is paralysed from neck down due to brain tumour
her parents are taking her out of the hospital and bringing her to their @entity20 home
her parents , *originally* from @entity132 , are deeply religious and think that allowing her to die is suicide , a sin

but she has then signed over all medical decisions to her father
