by @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 a peace has been negotiated between a @entity4 , @entity5 's and the group of local seniors hogging up their tables for hours , sustaining themselves on cheap coffee and packets of small fries			1
assemblyman @entity12 held a press conference across the street from the fast food chain monday to announce that management would loosen the 20 - minute seating rule during off - peak hours after the seniors in turn agreed to give up their seats between10am and 3pm if asked by diners			1
additionally , the restaurant will be looking into hiring employees who speak @entity24 and @entity25 - the primary languages of the neighborhood seniors - and a group will start providing transport to a local senior center to alleviate congestion in the restaurant			1
' we had to dig deeper to comprehend the pride of a small business owner as well as the pride of our seniors to seek a place to socialize , ' assemblyman @entity12 said			1
the new deal : a @entity42 's branch in @entity43 , @entity4 made a deal with the group of elderly locals who caused problems taking up all their seating the franchise 's owner @entity50 made a statement , saying the deal would create an environment ' where all customers who wish to enjoy this restaurant have the ability to do so '			1
' i â€™ve been proud to serve this community for nearly 20 years and my restaurant has been happy to welcome these customers for years , ' mr @entity50 added			1
@entity61 , the president of @entity62 , will also be providing a bus to a senior center that was previously hard to get to since it is several miles away			0
his group will be working with the @entity68 to hire @entity25 and @entity24 speakers for the @entity43 regulars			0
concessions : according to the new deal , management will loosen the 20 - minute seating rule if the seniors agree to give up their tables to diners eating in alternatives : a local senior center will also be providing transport to their facility several miles away to alleviate some of traffic in the restaurant the battle between the pensioners and @entity68 had escalated over the past few months with the police receiving four 911 calls since november about the group			1
some customers , with nowhere to sit , asked for refunds on their meals			2
a police source told @entity94 that people usually leave when asked by officers without any problems			0
however the defiant patrons admit that they just take a walk around the block and come back in again			0
the elderly patrons return to the @entity68 because they enjoy the long opening hours and find it convenient , patrons said today the @entity5 's in @entity43 is the popular hang - out spot for some of the elderly @entity24 community in the area police could prosecute patrons for trespassing if they refused to leave and the restaurant requested , but hope the matter could be worked out before that stage			1
@entity115 , 64 , who was enjoying a coffee , fries and reading newspapers with a group of six friends in @entity42 's last week , told @entity94 that she understood it was bad for business but that they needed a place to go			2
she said : ' it is open so early and stays open until after dark when it 's late			0
it 's warm and the old people like to have a place to meet and talk together			0
' an elderly customer leaves the branch where employees are becoming frustrated with how many hours the pensioners spend hogging the tables the conflict between management and the seniors may also be cultural , since coffee shops in @entity139 do n't have seating limits and they are considered places to meet with others to socialize			1
local people admit they bypass the location - which only has around ten booths and a few counter places - because there are never any seats			1
@entity149 , who was pushing an elderly woman in wheelchair whom she cares for , said they head to a @entity5 's further away because it is always so busy			0
she says : ' some people sit there all day long and and there 's no room for the wheelchair			0
' @entity43 resident @entity160 said : ' i think that place must do no business			2
people go there to read the newspaper			0
i go shopping for two , three hours and it 's always the same people sitting in the same places when i return			2
' the elderly people sometimes alternate with a @entity172 nearby on @entity173 which has more space and community boards inside for customers in @entity177 , @entity178 and @entity24			2
@entity179 offers the @entity24 community breakfast and lunch daily			0
they have even started offering coffee for 25c to ease the @entity5 's battle			0

staff at the @entity1 branch were becoming *increasingly* frustrated with the pensioners who are driving away business by spending hours at tables
on *sunday* , a local politician *brokered* a deal between the two groups that loosens the 20 - minute *searing* rule
in *exchange* , the seniors agree to give up their seats to customers wishing to eat in during the hours between 10am and 3pm
