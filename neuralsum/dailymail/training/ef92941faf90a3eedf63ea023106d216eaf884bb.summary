by @entity0 follow @ @ charliesale @entity1 have shamelessly altered their customer charter to allow them to change all three of their new @entity4 - supplied shirts every season			1
the club ’s merchandising code of conduct stated at the start of last week that the home strip would stay in place for a ‘ minimum of two years ’			0
but that promise was no longer there last thursday when the club launched their @entity4 kit			2
now home , away and third - choice strips last just one campaign — with the amended charter dating from the @entity4 launch saying : ‘ kits will have a life - span of one season			1
’ expensive habit : @entity1 are set to release three kits a season , sport manufactuters @entity4 have revealed ‘ we changed the charter for transparency reasons , ’ said a club spokesman			1
‘ there is a huge demand from our fans for new kit every year , similar to other clubs			0
’ meanwhile , @entity1 and their supporters are furious with the club ’s official partner @entity39 for using last season ’s 5 - 1 defeat at @entity44 and 6 - 0 beating by @entity46 in tv and radio advertising for the new season			2
a @entity39 spokesman said : ‘ we are sorry our tv ad has offended some fans			0
’ @entity53 have also forced @entity39 to drop their @entity55 promotion for the 2015 - 16 @entity56 because @entity39 ’s advertising rights for the tournament have n’t started yet			0
hold your horses : @entity39 have been forced by @entity53 to drop their @entity62 advert the @entity63 are expected to select 15 to 20 women members after the inevitable ‘ yes ’ vote in the @entity67 referendum on september 18 - rather than a token female representation as at @entity69			1
the first intake of @entity63 women is likely to include former world no 1 @entity73 , whose @entity75 junior tournament is supported by @entity67			1
the @entity78 ’s @entity77 golf presenter @entity76 could also join the @entity63 membership			1
welcome addition : former women 's world no 1 @entity73 is expected to join the @entity63 @entity83 golfer @entity82 was so impressed by the course knowledge of caddie @entity85 during a practice round that he has signed up the @entity88 local to carry his bag in @entity77			1
that last - minute decision makes gobbledegook of @entity77 sponsors @entity93 ’s bid to grab publicity by commissioning @entity96 research to show the impact of a caddie			1
it revealed the right bagman can improve a golfer ’s performance by 30 per cent			0
another poor publicity stunt has seen @entity104 placing their giant octopus advertising figure on a house overlooking the fourth green to showcase betting markets			0
the @entity63 swiftly ordered it to be removed , despite it being outside their grounds			2
you 're hired : @entity82 has signed up @entity85 as his caddie after being impressed by @entity88 knowledge the @entity115 ’ annual awards dinner at @entity77 had always been a rich feeding ground for stories due to the terrible speeches that were a marvellous feature of the event			1
but sadly that is no longer the case with the @entity115 closing the door on any controversy by no longer having speakers			0
instead , @entity128 ’s golf correspondent @entity127 conducts interviews			0
the ageist agenda that has caused problems for many talented female @entity78 broadcasters certainly does n’t impact on the @entity78 ’s continuing employment of 83 - year - old @entity134			1
he is on a roll - over contract , with @entity78 golf boss @entity137 saying : ‘ age does n’t come into it , @entity134 is as good as ever			2
’ so worryingly it looks like @entity134 will stay behind the mic until the current @entity77 contract ends in 2016 , when @entity143 will challenge strongly for the rights			2
golden oldie : @entity134 ( centre right ) is set to continue commentating golf for the @entity78 until at least 2016 @entity63 chief executive @entity148 , reacting to questions about @entity151 ’s story that the @entity78 are in danger of losing @entity77 , said : ‘ the value of golf rights has accelerated dramatically , particularly in the @entity155 , just in the last 12 months			1
and that ’s a bigger item in the equation than it might otherwise have been			0
’ @entity148 also wants to avoid the regular clash between @entity77 and the @entity158			0
on the same day adidas announced their £ 750m @entity161 kit contract , their golf arm @entity163 surprisingly did not hold their traditional @entity165 event , leaving @entity166 to grab all the attention			0
@entity163 ’s excuse was they had already paraded @entity170 before the @entity171 .			0

@entity1 's kit sponsors @entity4 to release three kits a season
@entity4 say ' kits will have a life - span of one season '
the @entity63 expected to select 15 - 20 women after the @entity67 referendum
@entity82 has hired caddie @entity85 for @entity77
