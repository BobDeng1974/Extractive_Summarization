by @entity0 published : 10:43 est , 10 august 2012 updated : 10:48 est , 10 august 2012 a @entity2 jet touched down in @entity3 without two of its first class passengers , because they refused to fly when the airline could not provide them with the right size of luxury pyjamas			1
the extraordinary dilemma facing the @entity11 ’s crew could not be resolved before the aircraft took off from @entity13 and so the angry couple demanded to leave the plane just as it was preparing to taxi from the terminal			0
the @entity19 couple absolutely refused a pair of business class pyjamas and insisted they had the first class type in xl - size or they would wait for another flight			1
delayed : a @entity28 flight from @entity13 to @entity3 was delayed when two first class passengers demanded they were given the right sized pyjamas finally the aircraft crew agreed , the doors were opened and the grumpy pair walked back into the terminal			1
it meant the aircraft was delayed for departure for the 15 - hour flight across the @entity39 by 30 minutes while the couple ’s baggage was unloaded			1
but rather than feeling angry about the situation , the other passengers on board were said to have roared with laughter when the captain announced the reason for the delay , @entity3 ’s @entity43 newspaper reported			1
business class passenger @entity51 said the captain had no hesitation in explaining the reason for a delayed take - off			1
‘ he said : “ just to inform you all , the reason we ’ve had the delay is because two of our first class passengers refused to fly on this plane as there were no extra large pyjamas on board for them , ’ said miss @entity51			2
she added that ‘ the pyjama guy ’ wanted the crew to tell everyone why the plane was late			0
‘ in his mind , he thought everyone sympathised with him , ’ said miss @entity51			0
‘ if you did n’t laugh , you would have cried			0
’ back to the terminal : the couple were left behind at @entity13 after refusing to stay on the @entity2 flight another passenger , who wanted to be known only as @entity80 , said passengers in first class could not believe what they were hearing			2
‘ they ( the couple ) were quite upset and simply refused to fly without pyjamas that fitted , ’ he told the @entity43 ‘ in the end , they disembarked and the flight was delayed as their baggage was removed			0
’ according to the airline , first class passengers are usually offered ‘ soft and luxurious pyjamas and slippers			0
' it also describes first class as a ‘ private sanctuary in the sky			0
’ last night @entity2 confirmed two passengers chose to get off a jet prior to departure in @entity13 , but other passengers were unaffected and the aircraft touched down in @entity3 on schedule .			2
