after @entity2 claimed a 3 - 1 against @entity3 at @entity4 , @entity1 's @entity0 runs the rule over how both sets of players rated			1
@entity8 7 to be here with a 3 - 1 win over @entity3 , after where he was on the podium after the defeat at @entity15 , shows how mentally tough he is			1
@entity16 3 he has made batting look hard at times and the @entity20 tour this winter will be a big one for him			2
he obviously has technical issues			2
@entity24 9 looks like a fluent version of @entity26			1
and that catch he took yesterday was a blinder			2
man of the moment : @entity24 showed his composure to help his side to victory against @entity3 @entity35 7 played outstandingly at @entity36 and he ’s allowed the odd quiet game , as he had at @entity4			1
still a slight flaw when the ball ’s around off stump			2
@entity42 9 he ’s been in phenomenal form this summer and has got his tempo spot on			2
he looks so well - suited to @entity45 — and must now stay there			2
@entity47 7 his off - spin has developed superbly after people were calling him a part - timer			2
one or two soft dismissals with the bat , but he ’s here to stay			2
@entity53 8 looks more thoughtful with the bat than some of us imagined he would be — he ’s not just a biffer			0
apart from a few bad moments at @entity60 , he kept well			0
utility man : @entity53 proved that he is capable of using the bat as well as the gloves @entity64 6 has been unlucky with the ball for much of the series , but he ’s put on a yard of pace from last summer			1
the key will be how he fares when there ’ s no swing			0
@entity74 6 got better as the series progressed			0
still some wayward deliveries there , but @entity2 can live with that as he mixes in some wicket - taking balls			1
handy contributions with the bat			0
@entity83 8 showed a lot of character , bowling through five tests with a dodgy knee , then batting yesterday against the short ball after breaking his nose in @entity91			0
@entity92 9.5 my admiration for him grows by the day			1
to keep setting top - class batsmen up takes serious skill			0
when the ball ’s swinging , there ’s no one better in world cricket			1
key player : @entity92 has proven that he is currently among the best bowlers in world cricket @entity105 and @entity92 thrilled with win total 79.5/110 @entity107 6 his fate mirrored the @entity110 team : he faded as the series progressed			1
was worked over beautifully by @entity92 : outswing , outswing , then inswing for the lbw			1
@entity115 1 a really odd selection when he had n’t played @entity117 for so long			1
his run - out summed things up — it was as if he wanted to escape the strike			0
@entity121 4 he kept getting good deliveries			0
looks like the most technically organised of the @entity110 batsmen , but that counted for little			0
nightmare : @entity115 was run out from a throw by @entity64 during the fifth test @entity128 3 @entity2 exposed his technical deficiencies superbly			1
tried to fight hard yesterday but against @entity83 , @entity92 and the moving ball , he was n’t up to it			1
@entity132 5 his superb hundred at @entity135 ’s set up @entity3 ’s only win , but — like @entity136 — he faded			1
drove a bit too early , which led to three caught and bowleds			0
@entity139 6 showed that you can score runs without a great technique , but some of the decisions he made out in the middle were a little strange			0
his position as @entity117 captain will be under pressure			0
under pressure : @entity139 , pictured with @entity149 , will be under extreme pressure after his side 's loss @entity153 4 i just could n’t work out what he was doing in the side			2
@entity139 obviously had no confidence in his bowling and he just looked to tee off with the bat			0
@entity160 6 his bowling held up an end and at least gave @entity139 some control — when he was n’t trying too many variations			0
his batting looked in good nick			0
@entity166 7 the only one of @entity3 ’s bowlers to play all five tests and it showed			1
he started the series superbly , but his bowling ( and his batting ) fell away			0
@entity173 7 hostile and unlucky — there were a few dropped catches off his bowling			0
he was the only @entity110 bowler to regularly unsettle @entity2 ’s batsmen			1
@entity178 7 @entity178 bowled well here at @entity4 to follow up his excellent display at @entity15			1
he ’s one of the few @entity110 players to emerge from this series with his reputation enhanced			0
bright spark : @entity3 bowler @entity178 can leave the @entity4 with his head held high total 56/110			1

@entity92 proved he is among the best bowlers in world cricket
@entity24 played a major role in @entity2 's triumph against @entity3
@entity3 's @entity115 was by far the worst player at @entity4
