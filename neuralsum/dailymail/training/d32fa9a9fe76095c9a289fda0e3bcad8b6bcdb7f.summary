by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity3 fans will be hoping that their team 's @entity5 final victory against @entity7 on saturday will provide a stepping stone for more silverware in the future			1
@entity12 boss @entity11 will know his squad will need a shake - up if the north @entity16 club are to challenge on four fronts next season			1
with that in mind , @entity19 's @entity0 takes a look at the potential ins and outs at the @entity25			0
potential ins @entity27 ( goalkeeper , unattached ) - the keeper will be available on a free transfer this summer			1
wages will be high but @entity3 are stronger financially now			1
safe : @entity35 's @entity34 future could be in doubt if @entity37 decides to bring back @entity38 @entity35 ( goalkeeper , @entity34 ) - @entity11 is a big fan			1
the club will be monitoring how the current situation with @entity42 pans out			0
@entity43 ( defender , @entity45 ) - been watched extensively by club scouts			2
unproven in the top - flight is @entity3 's biggest concern			1
@entity49 ( defender , @entity51 ) - would be available for around £ 5million			2
an @entity3 supporter , too			2
his versatility is key selling point			0
versatile : @entity49 would cost the @entity12 around £ 5million and he 's an @entity3 fan @entity55 ( defender , @entity57 ) - has impressed scouts during his breakthrough season			1
would add to the club 's @entity61 core			0
@entity63 ( midfielder , @entity65 ) - @entity11 tried to sign him last season			1
feeling is , bid £ 20million and he 's an @entity3 player			2
@entity67 ( midfielder , @entity57 ) - a cheaper alternative to @entity63 , but has his fans among the @entity12 backroom staff			0
talent : @entity63 has been on @entity11 's wishlist for a while and would fit into the team well on the list : @entity77 ( left ) and @entity78 could be lining up for @entity3 next season @entity77 ( midfielder , @entity81 ) - a dream midfield target for @entity11 , but the club fear he 's unobtainable			1
@entity78 ( striker , @entity85 ) - regularly linked with the @entity12 , is this the year @entity11 finally takes the plunge ? @entity87 ( striker , @entity89 ) - impressive goal record in @entity91			1
club thought about an offer in january			0
has a £ 34million release clause			0
wanted : @entity87 would be an expensive option but his goal record speaks for itself pedigree : @entity99 striker @entity98 would surely boost @entity3 's @entity101 title hopes @entity102 ( striker , @entity104 ) - could leave @entity104 this summer when @entity105 arrives			1
@entity98 ( striker , @entity99 ) - @entity11 has made repeated attempts to sign him over the past couple of summers			1
he is ready to try again			0
@entity110 ; @entity111 , @entity112 , @entity113 , @entity114 ; @entity63 , @entity115 , @entity116 ; @entity117 , @entity118 ; @entity98 @entity12 ? both @entity3 and @entity34 are rumoured to be in for the signing of @entity102 potential outs @entity123 - the club 's @entity5 hero will leave when his deal expires next month			1
@entity126 - his season - long loan from @entity128 has expired and he 'll leave the @entity25			0
@entity129 - the club have n't been able to resolve his long - running contract dispute and he 'll leave for either one of the @entity133 clubs			0
off : @entity129 ( right ) is yet to sign a new contract with the club and looks certain to leave out of favour : both @entity138 ( left ) and @entity139 could be on the move @entity139 - signed as the man to replace @entity114 at left - back but it has n't worked out that way			2
@entity138 - the @entity12 skipper has hardly featured this season and could ask to move on			0
@entity147 are keen @entity148 return to @entity149 after his largely ineffective loan spell			0
sign : @entity151 ( centre ) has had a good season but the @entity154 has just 12 months left on his contract @entity151 - has been a terrific signing but question marks over his future with just 12 months left on his deal			2
@entity160 - the self - professed ' best striker in the world ' will see his contract expire next month			2
@entity162 - has played a key role in the closing weeks of the season but struggled for games at the start			0
@entity169 - is likely to be pushed down the striking pecking order this summer			0
will he be happy with a place on the bench ? second best ? @entity169 has been @entity3 's star man but could get pushed down the pecking order moving on ? 28 - year - old @entity162 ( left ) could also leave @entity3 in the summer			1

@entity3 could look to sign under - threat @entity34 goalkeeper @entity35
@entity11 will hope to boost his squad in most areas
