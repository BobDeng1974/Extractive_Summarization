a trove of sunken treasure from the has been unearthed thanks to a drought that reduced a @entity5 river to puddles			1
more than ten tons of ornate marble statues , fountains and palace pillars appeared on the bed of @entity5 's @entity11 as its waters gradually receded to record lows over the summer			1
the haul is believed to have been left behind by marauding @entity16 invaders who plundered @entity5 's rulers in the 17th century loading the spoils onto barges to transport home			1
but experts believe the masonry proved too heavy for their wooden warships which eventually sank under the weight			2
artefacts : historians salvage 17th century marble and alabaster decorative structures in the bed of the @entity11 in @entity31 , @entity5 , after its waters ebbed to record low levels spoils : the haul is believed to have been left behind by marauding @entity16 invaders who plundered @entity5 in the 17th century , loading the spoils onto barges to transport home and while the ships were long - since swept away their cargo remained , entombed in mud at the bottom of the river for more than 400 years			1
the period is known in @entity5 as @entity46 , when the @entity48 hordes launched the @entity49 in 1655			1
while they had one of @entity53 's most powerful armies , @entity16 warlords had little with which to pay their troops so they swept through eastern @entity53 pillaging everything in their way			2
the armies plundered vast quantities of @entity5 's riches - most of which were never returned			2
@entity31 was so badly ravaged that its pre-war population of 20,000 was reduced to 2,000 by the time the @entity16 set sail for home			2
they even appeared to break up the stonework , large blocks of carved marble which were used in the columns , fountains , and staircases of @entity5 palaces , into manageable pieces which historians believe they planned to reassemble in their homeland			2
lost : the stonework has lain at the bottom of the @entity11 since the boats carrying it sank before reaching the @entity79 revealing : historians say the find is the best material evidence they have so far to recreate the events of the war nearly 500 years ago relics : the artefacts now lie exposed apart from a coating of foul - smelling yellow mud the drought also revealed other fragments of @entity5 history , including unexploded mines from the @entity93 and pieces of @entity96 gravestones - the legacy of successive @entity98 and @entity100 schemes to wipe out all traces of the @entity31 's jewish community			1
researchers knew about the artefacts , but , before the drought , retrieving them was a painstaking task because they were under several feet of water			0
now though , they are lying exposed apart from a coating of foul - smelling yellow mud			0
trove : more than ten tons of elaborate marble statues , fountains and palace pillars appeared on the bed of @entity5 's @entity11 as its waters gradually receded to record lows over the summer ' the drought helped us a lot because what had been lying underneath is now at the surface , ' said @entity119 , deputy director of the @entity120 , who is leading the effort to retrieve the marble stonework			1
speaking at a building owned by the @entity31 river police , where some of the stonework is being temporarily stored , he said historians ' knowledge about what happened four centuries ago had previously been sketchy			0
' now we have evidence , the best material evidence of the @entity16 invasion so far , ' mr @entity119 said			0
he said the gravestones , or matzevah , would be handed over to the city 's @entity133			0
finds of @entity96 artefacts are quite common in @entity31			2
spoils of war : the haul is believed to have been left behind in the river at capital @entity31 by marauding @entity16 invaders who plundered @entity5 rulers in the 17th century historians believed that the @entity16 who invaded @entity5 in the 17th century planned to move the looted cargo up the @entity11 to @entity146 , where the river joins the @entity79 , and from there transport it home			1
there is still no firm explanation of why the boats sank on the way			0
mr @entity119 said he and his team had so far located up to 10 tonnes of stonework , but this was only the beginning			0
' the boats had a capacity of 50 - 60 tonnes ( each ) , so we think that we should find much more , ' he said			0
the deluge : @entity162 's 1656 painting shows @entity16 king @entity163 in skirmish with @entity5 tartars at the battle of @entity31			1
@entity16 armies plundered vast quantities of @entity5 's riches during their invasion that began in 1655 once it has been removed from the river bed and catalogued , the plan is to take the masonry to @entity31 's @entity174 , one of the sites from which , historians believe , it was looted by the @entity16 invaders			1
for now though , the low water levels that revealed the artefacts are hampering efforts to retrieve them			0
regular lifting equipment would sink into the mud , but the river is too low for the researchers to bring in floating cranes			0
' we need to wait until it gets higher , ' @entity119 said .			0

the 10 - ton haul includes more than ten tons of elaborate marble statues , fountains and palace pillars looted from @entity5 rulers
the haul is believed to have been left behind by marauding 17th century @entity16 invaders stolen during the @entity49 in 1655
*possibly* was too heavy for the warships which sank outside @entity31
drought also revealed @entity93 bombs and @entity96 gravestones
