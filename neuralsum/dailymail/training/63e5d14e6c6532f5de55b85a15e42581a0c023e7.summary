by @entity0 published : 17:36 est , 6 may 2013 updated : 17:37 est , 6 may 2013 @entity1 have called for an urgent crackdown on foreign students who abuse the immigration system as figures show barely one in 1,000 suspected cases ends in deportation			1
universities reported a record 106,000 cases of suspected abuse by foreign students last year , following pressure to clamp down on bogus applications from those looking to come to @entity15 to work			1
but @entity17 figures reveal the @entity18 took action over just 658 individuals			1
of these , 153 cases – fewer than a quarter – ended in the suspect being deported			1
the @entity18 took action over just 658 individuals , of these only 153 of them were deported the figures , released under the @entity26 , suggest just 0.14 per cent of cases lead to deportation			1
they will fuel criticism of the @entity18 , which is set to be broken up following a warning from home secretary @entity32 that its performance is ‘ not good enough ’			2
@entity34 , a @entity35 member of the @entity37 home affairs committee , said the apparently lax enforcement risked undermining @entity40 efforts to crack down on bogus students			0
mr @entity34 said : ‘ it is extremely important that the @entity18 take this issue seriously , and thoroughly investigate where there are concerns			2
sir @entity47 of @entity48 said that the figures showed the scale of the abuse of the @entity15 education system ‘ these figures suggest the performance is nowhere near good enough			1
on the face of it they are looking into far too few cases and that is a serious matter because we ca n’t afford to have any holes in our system of immigration control			2
’ rules introduced in 2009 mean @entity66 students must be sponsored by a licensed college or university , which must report any concerns to @entity18			2
in the academic year 2011/12 colleges reported 106,698 warnings to @entity18 – up from 77,757 the previous year and 4,795 in the first year of the scheme			2
@entity47 , chairman of the think - tank @entity48 @entity48 , said the figures provided ‘ astonishing evidence of the sheer scale of abuse of the @entity15 education system by foreign students ’			1
in may last year the @entity18 launched @entity79 to deport those who had breached or overstayed their visas			0
but the latest figures suggest the initiative produced only modest results			0
a report last year accused @entity18 of ignoring tens of thousands of alerts from colleges , potentially allowing huge numbers to remain in the country on false pretences			0
of the 190,000 warnings since the system began , more than 70,000 involved reports of a significant change in a student ’s circumstances , 52,000 related to the college ending its visa sponsorship of the student , and almost 17,000 said a student had finished or dropped out of their course			0
other significant reasons included more than 32,000 reports of students failing to register for their courses on time and more than 1,700 reports students may have breached the conditions of their leave to remain in the @entity48			0
@entity17 sources yesterday stressed the rules require colleges to report a wide range of concerns , from the serious to the relatively innocuous			0
they also insisted hundreds of bogus colleges have been shut down in a bid to prevent people using further education as a backdoor route into @entity15			1
since 2009 more than 800 bogus colleges have been stripped of their licences			0
a @entity17 spokesman said : ‘ our education system is one of the best in the world			1
‘ we have overhauled the student visa regime to tackle abuse and figures show our changes are having the right effect			0
more university students are coming here and bogus students are being kept out			0

the @entity18 took action over just 658 individuals
of these , 153 cases - fewer than a quarter - ended in deportation
@entity47 said it showed the ' sheer scale ' of the abuse of the @entity15 education system
