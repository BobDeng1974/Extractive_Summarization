@entity0 today urged @entity2 leaders to ‘ be good to their word ’ and stop funding @entity6 fanatics by paying ransoms			1
the prime minister said ‘ tens of millions of dollars ’ had been paid to extremists in @entity10 and @entity11			1
he said this was helping to promote terror against @entity14			1
mr @entity0 told @entity16 @entity15 , @entity17 and other countries in the @entity20 group of wealthy countries had pledged not to pay ransoms at a summit in @entity24 last year			1
but the pm indicated they were not sticking to this agreement			2
@entity0 , speaking during prime minister 's questions today , said ransoms were directly funding @entity6 the prime minister ’s remarks , in the @entity30 this afternoon , come after @entity6 extremists threatened to murder a @entity14 hostage after releasing a video of themselves beheading two @entity38 journalists			1
the @entity40 ’s capture emerged in a propaganda video titled ' a second message to @entity38 ' , in which @entity38 journalist @entity43 is murdered by an @entity6 executioner who speaks with a @entity14 accent			1
the murderer is believed to be the same man who beheaded @entity48 two weeks ago			0
former @entity50 leader sir @entity49 asked the prime minister today whether those who were paying ransoms were aware that the cash was being used ‘ to advance the malevolent objectives of terrorism ’			2
the prime minister said : ‘ there is no doubt in my mind that the many tens of millions of dollars that @entity6 has raised from ransom payments is going into promoting terrorism , including terrorism affecting our own country			1
‘ at the @entity66 , i launched an initiative to try to get other countries to sign up to a very clear doctrine that in the case of terrorist kidnap , no ransom should be paid			2
@entity14 continues with this policy ; @entity38 continues with this policy ; but we need to redouble the efforts to make sure that other countries are good to their word			1
’ mr @entity0 ’s remarks are a barely - veiled rebuke to @entity15 , @entity17 and @entity81 who are known to pay ransoms			1
the prime minister last month faced calls to confront the @entity15 president @entity86 over claims the country is funding @entity6 terrorists by paying ransoms to free hostages			1
mr @entity0 's remarks today are a thinly - veiled rebuke to @entity2 leaders , including @entity86 and @entity95 , to stop authorising ransoms to terrorists @entity14 and the @entity38 refuse to negotiate with terrorists in an effort not to encourage further hostage taking			1
but this policy is being undermined by @entity2 countries negotiating secret deals to free their citizens			0
over the last five years @entity6 is thought to have earned £ 75million ransoming more than 50 captives			0
kidnapping @entity2 has become the main source of revenue for @entity108 and its spin off			0
four @entity15 and three @entity111 hostages have been released this year after money was delivered through an intermediary			2
fears have been raised that @entity2 countries ’ policy of secretly negotiating with terrorists is undermining the @entity118 ’s response to the growing threat from @entity6			2
@entity121 mp @entity120 , who sits on the respected @entity122 , said : ‘ if they are paying ransoms they are harming the interests of the free world and by playing the game of terrorism by paying ransom money they are funding and furthering the cause of @entity6 and @entity108			0
‘ the @entity15 and the @entity111 should really look at themselves in the mirror and ask whether this is the right thing to do			2
’ ‘ the prime minister should be raising this with president @entity86			0
the @entity15 are undermining all of us by doing this			2
’ a @entity142 source told @entity143 it was a concern for the government			0
‘ it is definitely an issue , ’ the source said			0
‘ all you can do is emphasise what we do and why we think it is right			0
a lot of countries wo n’t talk about it			0
some countries will say one thing and another thing happens			0
’ @entity48 ( left ) and @entity43 ( right ) were murdered by @entity6 fanatics thought to be operating in @entity11 but a former senior cabinet minister told @entity143 that there was no point ‘ tweaking the @entity15 tail ’ because the @entity14 would not get anywhere			1
he added : ‘ they do n’t admit it			0
it comes out through what other people say			0
when you see a @entity15 president on the tarmac greeting a freed hostage you can be fairly sure they paid			1
’ militants are now thought to hold more than 20 captives , mostly aid workers , journalists and photographers who they are ransoming in order to raise funds .			0

@entity183 said ' tens of millions of dollars ' had been paid to @entity185 terrorists
he said @entity15 , @entity17 and other @entity20 countries vowed not to pay ransoms
but mr @entity0 suggested only the @entity38 and @entity14 were sticking to this
