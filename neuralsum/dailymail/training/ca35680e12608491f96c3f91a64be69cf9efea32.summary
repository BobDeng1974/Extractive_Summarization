@entity0 remain in talks with @entity3 defender @entity2 over a possible £ 10million move with @entity5 on course to sign a centre - half in the january window			1
@entity5 is likely to delay making a final bid for the 24 - year - old @entity10 for another 48 hours as the club assess alternatives before making a final decision			2
the @entity10 is high on @entity0 ’s list of wanted defenders - but they will have to act quickly to get him as he is yet to play for @entity17 and does not meet work permit criteria			1
@entity20 defender @entity2 ( left ) shields the ball from @entity23 's @entity22 with work permits due to be tightened up in the summer by the @entity26 and @entity27 , this may be the last chance to sign him before the stricter criteria rules him out			0
but @entity5 has now whittled down his short list to two or three candidates and appears determined to make a signing by the end of the month			0
@entity33 ( right ) beats @entity35 's @entity34 to a high ball at the gps stadium in december			0

@entity3 defender @entity2 may move to @entity0 for £ 10m
@entity2 signed a five - year deal with @entity3 in 2013
the @entity10 is high on @entity0 ’s *defensive* *wishlist* list
@entity5 is determined to sign a defender before the end of january
