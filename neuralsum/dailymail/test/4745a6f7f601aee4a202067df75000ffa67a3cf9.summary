an unknown illustrator who films her every move and interacts with strangers for hours at a time has become one of the internet 's biggest celebrities - and she 's only been online for 29 days			1
@entity9 , 25 , is one of the stars of @entity11 , @entity13 's new live broadcasting platform and has been ' loved ' over 7.5 million times in less than a month since it launched			1
branded the @entity18 of the social platform , when the brunette starts a live stream , thousands of @entity11 users around the globe stop what they 're doing to watch			1
' this is crazy ! ' @entity9 continued during her bedroom broadcast , and before she has even taken a breath , hundreds of hearts flutter on to her screen - more tokens of ' love ' from the thousands of people watching			2
last month , the art graduate was going about her anonymous life as an illustrator for entertainment site @entity49 online but her periscope broadcasts , which show her going about her daily business in @entity31 , have catapulted her into the limelight			2
and so far she has had little competition from ' real ' celebrities			2
@entity56 is the highest ranking star but is trailing behind @entity9 with a mere three million ' loves '			1
' this is like a reality show , but it ’s not scripted , ' @entity9 tells her thousands of viewers continuing her bedroom broadcast			2
' before this happened i always thought i 'd love to share my life with more people because i ’m always up to really spontaneous things			0
' @entity9 mulls over the day during a live broadcast , whilst she chats to the viewers messaging her ( which appear on left of screen )			1
so far she has been ' loved ' 7.5million times , shown by hearts on the right the new app not only allows users to stream live video to anyone on @entity79 who wants to watch , but allows viewers to chat to the broadcaster in real time by typing messages that pop up on screen			1
so @entity9 's monologue is peppered with shout - outs and answers to questions from her viewers			1
' hey @entity89 , ' she says acknowledging a new follower			0
' i was going to sleep when i thought about this last broadcast			0
@entity94 you ’re funny ! ' she continues in reference to a message , then ' you ’re so beautiful ' pops up from @ @entity94			0
' i do n’t know how many of you saw me tonight , ' she says			0
' we randomly talked to my neighbour , then i went to see my friend @entity100			0
then i met with a periscope follower for the first time			0
' a little yellow square with the message ' show us your boobs ' flashes up on screen			0
' why would you do that ? ' she adds			0
' now you 're blocked forever			0
' a live webcam platform , may seem to have porn written all over but users wo n't be flashing anything x-rated during broadcasts - nudity is banned			2
although bought by @entity13 in january for close to $ 100million ( £ 67million ) , periscope is a tech mash - up of selfies , social networking and reality tv , only launched last month , twitching curtains to peek at the neighbours may still be a ' no ' but watching @entity9 randomly go about her day ? that 's ' way cool ' , to quote the star herself			1
and like all the best social networking platforms , the content need not be thrilling to grab considerable global attention			0
in the last 24 hours , @entity9 has broadcast some mundane errands , some sitting in traffic in her @entity131 ( phone in recording mode balanced on her dash board , of course ) and a random chat with her neighbour periscope allows people to live - stream video from their phones to their @entity13 followers with the click of a button			1
the periscope team outlined a range of possibilities for the service , including how it can turn any smartphone user into a global reporter			0
in the last 24 hours , @entity9 has broadcast herself going on mundane errands , sitting in traffic in her @entity131 ( phone in recording mode balanced on her dash board , of course ) and a random chat with her neighbour			1
five hours before her bedtime round - up , @entity9 was broadcasting live from an @entity31 bar , watching her friend @entity100 perform the bass guitar			1
' i 'm drinking water			0
i do n't like to drink alcohol , ' @entity9 tells viewers in answer to their questions , before introducing some followers she 's come across at the bar			2
' hey we 're double @entity171 , ' she says capturing her new friends waving their phones in the air capturing her capturing them			0
but it 's all too much - even for @entity9			2
' we ’re going to get off the phone soon so we can enjoy each others ' real company , ' she says			0
what will today hold for @entity9 when she wakes up in a few hours time ? judging by today , perhaps a trip to the post office , a bit of sitting in traffic and a lot of mulling over the wonders of her new found mutual love for @entity11			1
sound thrilling ? do n't be shy to admit it			0
@entity9 broadcasting live from an @entity31 bar			1
' i 'm drinking water			0
i do n't like to drink alcohol , ' she tells viewers in answer to questions about what she 's drinking despite the initial hype surrounding the launch of @entity11 , @entity13 's @entity29 app , which is being touted as a revolutionary new way to share news , there are already a concerning number of users , particularly women , reporting that they have been sexually harassed , or trolled			1
@entity206 , app developer of the app @entity207 , told @entity209 that because @entity11 ' allows users to share even more of their intimate lives with each other than ever before ' , there are ' apparent dangers ' that users have to consider before accessing it			1
@entity215 features : the app , which is owned by @entity13 , allows users to follow certain people ( @entity218 ) and scroll through a ' watch ' feed of live videos ( r ) @entity222 , sex and relationships editor at @entity224 , noted that the app is already crawling with men who are using the anonymity afforded to them by the app 's settings in order to sexually harass women - including one of her female friends			1
she explained that her friend recently tried out the app by sharing a conversation she was having with her female roommate			0
they were fully clothed , sitting on a couch and casually conversing , yet ' within the first 20 seconds the first comment popped up ’ , asking for the women to ‘ show butt ’			0
while neither of them were speaking in an even remotely sexual manor , the lewd comments continued to pour in and included phrases such as : ' @entity249 ? ' and ' i would soooo swipe right on both [ sic ] ! ' streaming revolution : @entity11 , an @entity29 app that allows users to broadcast live video and audio to the internet , launched last thursday one particularly creepy user asked : ' do you get out of the shower to pee ? ' according to @entity11 's community guidelines , the app prohibits ' pornographic or overtly sexual content ' as well as ' explicitly graphic content or media that is intended to incite violent , illegal or dangerous activities '			1
and while a spokesperson for the app told @entity222 that @entity11 has a team dedicated to content review , there does n't appear to be anything specific being done to prevent sexual commentary and online harassment			2
the app 's policies are , unsurprisingly , similar to @entity13 , which is currently testing out a ' quality filter ' that monitors and removes threats and offensive language out of users notifications feeds			1
it 's not clear as to whether or not @entity11 will be given a similar screening system .			2

strangers watch @entity9 , 25 , from @entity31 , all day long
she 's the star of @entity11 , @entity13 's new live broadcasting *mobile* app
it streams live video and users can chat and message in real time
she 's already more popular than celebrities including @entity56
