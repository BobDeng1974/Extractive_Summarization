@entity1 people are becoming more and more sleep deprived - and it 's all down to bringing laptops and tablets into the bedroom			1
according to a new survey , bingeing on tv box sets is now our top ' lights on ' bedroom activity with 34 per cent delaying much - needed kip just to watch their favourite shows			1
as a nation our average bed time is 10.43pm , but we 're busy for nearly an hour ( 52 minutes ) before we actually go to sleep , according to new research			1
binge - watching box sets is number one sleep - stealers with 34 per cent watching dvds in bed the survey of 1,000 adults , which excluded sex as an option , found that binge - watching dvds or streamed programmes from the internet is now the number one sleep - stealer			1
checking social media feeds was still a high second at 30 per cent , followed by writing emails or working ( 17 per cent ) , online shopping ( 11 per cent ) and reading at just four per cent			1
guilty pleasures such as eating biscuits , having a cuppa away from the rest of the family and playing addictive games like @entity42 also sneaked into the top answers in a poll by @entity45			2
although 83 per cent questioned claimed to love sleep , and that it was more important to them than food ( 66 per cent ) , we 're actually getting less and less every year			0
according to the survey , the average amount of sleep is now six hours 28 minutes , compared to our grandparents ' generation who got a good eight hours every night			1
although 56 per cent of us claim to be unsatisfied with the amount of sleep we have every night , but we ca n't seem to tear ourselves away from our favourite shows			1
some respondents admitting that it was all too easy to press play again and miss out on beauty sleep			0
a minority will enjoy a snack in bed and a moment alone , while one per cent of us admit @entity42 keeps them awake in bed when they should have turned their lights out 1			2
internet tv / streaming / box sets 34 % 2			0
checking @entity73 / social media 31 % 3			1
working / emails / accounts 17 % 4			0
online shopping / browsing / magazines 11 % 5			0
reading @entity78 / books / mags 4 % 6			0

playing online games / gambling 1.2 % it seems there is also a male / female divide when it comes to going to bed times , with the majority of men questioned saying they go to bed between 11pm and midnight , but most women were already snuggled up an hour earlier between 10 and 11pm			2
@entity91 of @entity45 said : ' it seems we are becoming a nation of binge - watchers , unable to wait another week for the next episode			0
' perhaps it 's time to bring a bit of balance back into the bedroom and try some sleep - enhancing activities a few nights a week			1
instead of switching on a screen ; try some gentle yoga stretches , listening to soothing music or even meditating			0
' there are lots of apps available designed to enhance sleep and can easily be listened to in bed , putting that mobile phone to good use			2
' what do you like to do in bed , apart from sleeping ( only clean answers please )			0

watching top shows in bed costs us nearly an hour of sleep a night
