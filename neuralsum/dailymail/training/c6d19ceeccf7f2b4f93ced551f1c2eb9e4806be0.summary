by @entity1 reporter published : 18:27 est , 2 december 2012 updated : 04:44 est , 3 december 2012 this is the dramatic moment when a whole chunk of @entity5 coastline came crashing down on to a beach			1

local people claim it is the fifth fall in a week after the ground became saturated with torrential rain with residents in @entity40 seeing large parts of their elongated rear gardens disappear from sight			1
in one garden a wooden shed sits on the edge of the fall - with its owners no longer going anywhere near the hut			2
security barriers erected at the end of another garden lay crumpled on the beach below along with grass and trees			2
the latest massive fall has led to calls for emergency action to be taken as more heavy rainfall is due to hit the region			2
the @entity21 and @entity10 world heritage site stretches 95 miles with rocks recording 185 million years of the @entity65 's history			1
another section of the @entity67 at @entity68 on the @entity10 - @entity21 border was also cordoned off after a crack was spotted in the cliff			1

' another local resident @entity83 has been studying the cliff for the last 25 years			2
making waves : the collapsed segment of cliff is gradually washed out to sea he was one of dozens of people who were at the scene at the weekend looking at the crumbling cliffs which have become a local attraction			2
he said : ' we had exceedingly heavy rain and it was saturated on the top part of the cliff			1
' water tends to dribble out at various sections but the water can not permeate the top section and it makes it unstable			0
it normally dries out before it comes down but there is too much pressure on it now			0
' it is to do with the weather pattern			0
the sea is not doing the damage at the base of the cliffs			0
there is n't much anyone can do about this			0
surveyors have been out looking at it			0
' we used to have two minor falls a year for the last 20 years			0
but there are a lot more now			0

the @entity9 based councillor said : ' i am of the opinion that unless some form of emergency rock revetment work is carried out and put in place it will only be a matter of a short period of time before we lost the last section of cliff that is protecting both eastern town and @entity144 from south easterlies and , with it , the threat of tidal flooding			1

residents claim it is the fifth collapse along the 95 mile stretch of historic coastline in a week
