@entity12 is accused of administering fatal doses of drugs or reducing the amount of oxygen given to patients in the hospital 's intensive care ward			1
the doctor was arrested last month over the premature deaths of seven terminally ill patients ( file picture ) the doctor was initially charged with involvement in the deaths of seven patients			1
but an inquiry by @entity1 's @entity30 has already increased that number to 20 with around 300 other suspicious deaths at the hospital still under investigation , it was revealed today			1
dr @entity36 , leading the investigation , told @entity1 's @entity38 programme his team had analysed patient deaths overseen by @entity12 over the last seven years			2
he said @entity12 ' played @entity41 ' by deciding which patients should die in order to free up beds in the ward			2
he said : ' there are 20 cases which have already been closed , and we have nearly 300 cases still open which we are looking at			2
' in each case , the testimony of people who worked inside the hospital confirmed what we have found on the patient records			2
' if confirmed , @entity56 would surpass @entity58 's @entity57 as the world 's most deadly doctor			1
@entity57 , who hanged himself in prison aged 57 , murdered at least 215 patients aged between 47 and 93 over 25 years			1
one of the deaths de @entity12 is accused of is that of @entity64 , who was on a life support system and died in january this year			1
if the @entity67 's fears are confirmed , @entity12 would surpass @entity58 gp @entity57 as the world 's deadliest doctor @entity12 is accused of reducing the oxygen he was receiving from 45 per cent to the minimum level of 21 per cent , a concentration too low for anyone to survive			1

according to dr @entity36 , the reduction of oxygen and the administering of @entity77 was the cause of most of the other suspicious deaths which occured during @entity12 's watch			1

' this patient had asked his family to bring his glasses so he could do some reading while he was in the intensive care ward			0
' another patient had just asked a nurse for a cup of water			0
' this nurse testified that one of the things she will never forget is that she did n't manage to give him the cup of water because by the time she returned he had already died			0
' @entity12 's lawyer , @entity120 , said the doctor will protest her innocence			0
she said : ' soon we will be able to prove that what happened in that ward can be justified in medical writings			0
