by @entity0 last updated at 5:42 pm on 11th october 2011 looking tired and dejected , @entity2 's rugby team finally appeared to be taking things seriously as they arrived back in @entity4 today			0
after being dumped out of the @entity5 by @entity6 at the weekend , @entity2 had looked in high spirits as they boarded a plane home from @entity10			0
but their demeanour as they touched down at @entity12 this afternoon was more suitable for a side that had delivered poor performances on the field and poor behaviour off it			2
facing the music : @entity18 ( left ) and @entity19 exit a side - door after landing at @entity12 today @entity2 coach @entity21 appeared more relaxed as he prepared for the final leg of his journey home @entity18 and team - mate @entity19 looked like players preparing to face the music as they exited an airport side - door - in sharp contrast to their high jinx at @entity29 yesterday			1
there , @entity19 kissed his team captain ’s head in what was believed to be a reference to @entity18 's encounter – captured on a nightclub ’s @entity36 – with old friend @entity38			1
@entity18 , of course , is newly married to @entity40 , the @entity41 ’s grand - daughter			1
not that @entity19 had any reason to be playing the jester			2
hours earlier he had been held by police after jumping from the deck of a ferry - the final embarrassment of the trip			0
the 20 - year - old , who came close to being deported from @entity4 last year for overstaying his visa , was held in @entity29 after he jumped from a ferry as it was about to berth and swam ashore , apparently egged on by other players			0
back home : the @entity2 team 's demeanour was more suitable for a side that had delivered poor performances on the field and poor behaviour off it copycat : @entity19 mimics the kiss from @entity38 on @entity18 at @entity29 yesterday embarrassing : while in a @entity10 bar @entity18 , the newest member of the royal family , was kissed on the head by a blonde his antics came after @entity2 were knocked out of the @entity5 by @entity6 at the quarter - final stage and at the end of a team visit to @entity72 , which lies 35 minutes by ferry from @entity29 , during which the players and management toured vineyards			1
it was the latest controversial incident to involve an @entity2 player during the team 's ill - fated campaign which has seen @entity18 caught on cctv kissing a blonde in a @entity83 nightclub			1
three other players – @entity85 , @entity86 and @entity87 – were reprimanded for their actions involving a female member of staff in the team hotel in a separate incident			0
other incidents include the suspension of two players for dangerous play , the suspension of two coaches over ball - switching against @entity100 and the fining of @entity19 for wearing a gumshield with unauthorised advertising			1
in big trouble : @entity19 is spoken to by a security officer after jumping off a ferry in @entity29 , which ended with him being fined £ 3,000 evening swim : @entity19 , circled , makes his way across the harbour from the ferry as people gathered on deck to watch the prank @entity19 - considered by many as @entity2 's best player during the tournament - jumped from the catamaran ferry , @entity118 , as it prepared to berth at the @entity29 waterfront with the defeated @entity2 team on board			1
the @entity124 - born player swam a short distance to pier 3 and while there were shouts of encouragement from many passengers on the ferry , the police were not amused and @entity19 was taken to @entity132 police station			1
he could have been charged with disorderly conduct , but was given a warning and allowed to return to the team hotel			0
@entity19 was later seen with other players out at a bar until the small hours			2
passionate : @entity19 , centre , with arm across his chest , sings the national anthem with other members of the @entity2 team ahead of the quarter - final with @entity6 , which @entity2 lost kick in the teeth : @entity19 was also fined for wearing this gumshield displaying unauthorised sponsorship he was fined £ 3,000 by the @entity148			1
@entity2 manager @entity21 said : ‘ this was an irresponsible thing to do			0
@entity19 has been disciplined internally and i have warned him about his future conduct			2
’ angry officials of the company that operates the ferry said the incident was ‘ extremely dangerous ’			0
spokesman @entity156 said : ‘ the ferry had made a turn and was about to reverse to its berth when this happened			0
‘ it could have been tragic with vessels coming in here and someone jumping off the back of a vessel when it is going to be reversing shortly			0
' just mates mucking around ' : @entity18 and @entity38 were seen drunkenly kissing , but @entity40 was reassured that nothing untoward happened just married : @entity18 and @entity40 after their wedding in @entity170 in july			2

@entity18 and @entity19 looked ashen - faced as they left @entity12
