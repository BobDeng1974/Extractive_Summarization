doomsday fanatics claim that a 12th century prophecy states the successor to @entity3 will be the last pope before the @entity5			1
after the @entity8 2012 prophecies failed to materialise , apocalypse aficionados have turned their attention to the purported writings of @entity11 , an @entity13 saint and archbishop of @entity15 , who lived between 1094 and 1148			1
@entity11 is said to have travelled to @entity16 in 1139 , where he experienced a vision of future popes , writing down a series of 112 cryptic phrases that described each one in turn			1
prophecies : @entity11 , an @entity13 saint who lived between 1094 and 1148 is said to have travelled to @entity16 in 1139 , where he experienced a vision of future popes the saint 's final prediction ' @entity28 ' is now being linked to leading contender @entity30 cardinal @entity29			1
according to @entity11 's visions , ' @entity32 ' will be the 112th and final pope after whom it is stated that the ' the seven - hilled city will be destroyed and the dreadful judge will judge the people '			1
although not part of official @entity41 teaching , the @entity38 is well known by @entity43 officials and @entity41 scholars			1
naysayers have found ways to successfully link each of the phrases to a corresponding pope throughout the centuries			1
pope @entity52 , for instance is associated with phrase no. 110 , ' from the labour of the sun , ' because he was both born and entombed on the day of a solar eclipse			1
and current pope @entity3 , is linked to phrase no 111 , ' glory of the olive ' due to the fact that some members of the monastic order founded by @entity63 are known as @entity64			1
the ominous phrase no 112 , reads : ' in the final persecution of the @entity68 there will reign @entity32 ( @entity38 ) , who will feed his flock amid many tribulations ; after which the seven - hilled city will be destroyed and the dreadful judge will judge the people			1
' current pope @entity3 , is linked to phrase no. 111 , ' glory of the olive ' due to the fact that some members of the monastic order founded by @entity63 are known as @entity64 , while the final prediction ' @entity32 ' is being linked to leading contender for his successor @entity30 cardinal @entity29 and with @entity29 being a member of the @entity80 or @entity81 , it is enough to have doomsday prophets heading back to their bunkers			1
however many experts believe the so - called ' prophecy of @entity87 ' is a fake and was made up in an attempt to increase a 16th - century cardinal 's chances of becoming pope			1
one of the biggest holes is the fact they only came to light in 1595 , in a book by @entity99 monk @entity98			2
the original text was said to have lain unnoticed in @entity16 's archives until @entity98 published it			2
sister @entity103 , a historical theologian at the @entity104 who specializes in medieval texts , told @entity106 : ' there are just a number of red flags , ' ' the material that implies they 're talking about future popes is rather scanty indeed , and there are factual errors			2
... the likelihood is that they 're some kind of forgery			2
' while it is an accepted fact that our planet will one day be consumed by the @entity122 , modern science has calculated that that will not happened for several billion years			0
but that has n't stopped mankind repeatedly predicting that the world is about to end			0
in fact , doomsday prophecies have been made ever since we started using calendars , with flood , famine , incoming asteroids and nuclear wars among the favoured causes of annihilation			0
biblical scholars point out that in the @entity139 , @entity137 himself implies that the world will end within the lifetime of his contemporaries , while a host of scholars made similar predictions in the first millennium			0
the craze appears to have reached a peak in @entity148 in the @entity149			0
in 1500 , @entity151 reformer @entity150 proclaimed that ' the kingdom of abominations shall be overthrown ' within 300 years			0
others to get in on the act included @entity156 ( 1656 ) , mathematician @entity157 ( 1688 ) and astrologer sir @entity158 ( 1948 )			0
the town of @entity163 in the @entity164 , with the mountain in the background from which , according to the @entity8 prophecy rumour , a spaceship would emerge to carry people to safety more recently , the fad for making @entity172 predictions has become popular amongst @entity174 groups in the @entity175 according to website @entity176 , prophecy teacher @entity169 announced in 1976 that president @entity177 would be ' the president who will meet mr. 666 - soon ' , and about 50 members of a group called the @entity181 gathered at @entity182 , @entity183 , in white robes , awaiting their ' rapture ' from a world about to be destroyed on may 25 , 1981			1
' a small crowd of onlookers watched and waited for something to happen			0
the members chanted prayers to the beat of bongo drums until sunset			0
the end did not come , ' the website notes			0
the year 2000 was also expected to usher in an apocalypse of sorts , with aeroplanes falling from the sky and computer systems crashing			0
in the days leading up to september 9 , 2009 , fans of @entity204 insisted that the world would end - 9/9/9 being the emergency services phone number in the @entity207 and also the number of the @entity209 - albeit upside down			2
surprisingly there was n't the same hyperbole on june 6 , 2006			0
but if the world does manage to get through today unscathed , believers wo n't have to wait too long before another popular doomsday prediction date looms			2
the @entity214 of @entity215 was for several centuries one of the most advanced in the world			0
along with their architectural achievements , the @entity214 left us with calendars that , some argue , predicted the end of the world on december 21 , 2012			0
according to internet rumours circulating at the time , a mountain near the @entity164 town of @entity163 would burst open just in time for a spaceship to emerge to carry people to safety .			2

ominous prediction is part of the writings of @entity13 saint @entity11
he wrote down 112 cryptic phrases which describe each @entity87 in turn
pope @entity52 is linked to phrase 110 ' from the labour of the sun '
while 111 ' glory of the olive ' has been associated with @entity3
' when the seven - hilled city will be destroyed and the dreadful judge will judge the people , ' is the 112th and final line
