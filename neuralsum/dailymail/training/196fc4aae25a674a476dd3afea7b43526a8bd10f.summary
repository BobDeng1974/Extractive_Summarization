the first @entity1 drug trial in @entity2 has started with three healthcare workers in @entity4 receiving an experimental vaccine			1
it comes as the @entity7 ( @entity7 ) today warned the virus is now ' entrenched ' in the capital cities of the three worst - hit countries , and is accelerating in almost all settings			1
the trial started on october 8 , with the first health worker receiving the drug , followed by two colleagues yesterday			1
over the course of the trial 37 more healthcare workers will be given the vaccine			2
the first @entity1 drug trial in @entity2 has started with three healthcare workers in @entity4 receiving an experimental vaccine			1
scientists say if successful it will ' alter the dynamic of the outbreak ' the trial is taking place at @entity4 's @entity27			1

the @entity7 said the disease has so far claimed the lives of more than 3,800 people , infecting at least 8,000 people in @entity2			2
the organisation 's deputy head @entity57 warned that the world 's response is not keeping up with the disease in @entity62 , @entity44 and @entity63 - the three worst - hit nations			1
yesterday @entity66 leaders chided the international community for its slow response to the epidemic and appealed to the world to turn promises of aid into action on the ground			2
in emotional appeals to a high - level meeting of major donors gathered at the @entity79 , the leaders of @entity63 , @entity62 and @entity44 , said they needed everything from treatment centres to healthcare workers , equipment and funding			1
professor @entity28 , from the @entity85 , who helped developed the experimental drug , said if successful the trial ' could alter the dynamic ' of the current outbreak			1
while the university 's dean @entity90 , said the research ' will play a key role in helping solve ' the crisis			0
@entity63 's president @entity95 told the meeting in @entity97 via video conference : ' our people are dying			2
healthcare workers are at the front line of the epidemic , and are most likely to become infected with @entity1 if successful it will be months before any vaccine is available and the initial quantities will be reserved for healthcare workers fighting the crisis the @entity7 ( @entity7 ) today warned the virus is now ' entrenched ' in the capital cities of the three worst - hit countries , and is accelerating in almost all settings the @entity7 's deputy head @entity57 warned that the world 's response is not keeping up with the disease in @entity62 , @entity44 and @entity63 - the three worst - hit nations scientists at a @entity120 company say they have come up with a test to fight the @entity1 epidemic			1
experts at @entity124 said it has developed a fast and simple way to screen suspected victims			0
they say the kit detects the dna fingerprint of the @entity130 in the blood in just 90 minutes and is ' affordable ' and ' easy to use '			0
the firm is now in talks with the @entity7 about plans to roll out large numbers to the frontline in @entity2 as soon as possible			2
doctor @entity137 , managing director of @entity124 , a spin - off company from the @entity139 , said it meets an ' urgent ' need			0
dr @entity137 said : ' accurate diagnostics is essential in controlling an outbreak like @entity1			0
' there is an urgent need for rapid testing to screen suspected patients and people travelling in and out of the region			0
' our test is quick , affordable and easy to perform			0
' by picking up minute quantities of the disease in the early stages , the kit makes pre-emptive healthcare intervention possible			2
it works on the principle that viruses all have a unique genetic fingerprint , like humans , only its encoded in @entity162 ( @entity164 acid ) rather than @entity165			0
a blood sample is taken from the patient before @entity162 is extracted , placed in a tube with the kit 's ingredients and run through a machine			2
the result is ready within 90 minutes			0
' without you we ca n't succeed , without your quick response a tragedy unforeseen '			0
professor @entity28 , said : ' this research will give us crucial information about whether the vaccine is safe , well tolerated and capable of stimulating adequate immune responses in the highest priority target population , health care workers in @entity2			2
' ' if it works , in the foreseeable future it could help alter the dynamic of this epidemic by interrupting transmission to health care and other exposed front - line workers			1
' the drug consists of an adenovirus ( cold virus ) that does not cause illness in humans			0
it has been modified so it ca n't multiply in humans , but produces a single attachment protein of ebola virus			0
the body 's immune responses against this single @entity1 protein have been found to be highly protective in studies carried out on animals , researchers said			0
prior to september the vaccine had only been tested in animals			0
a second trial on @entity66 soil is expected to begin soon in the @entity213 , to run in parallel with the @entity4 study			1
ordinarily it would take between six to 11 months to obtain the necessary ethical , technical and administrative approvals to move from animal vaccine trials to one in a developing country , where subjects are at risk of the natural disease			2
but the consortium behind the vaccine study worked in unison to achieve the goal in two months			0
professor @entity30 , director general of @entity4 's centre for vaccine development said : ' this is just the critical first step in a series of additional clinical trials that will have to be carried out to fully evaluate the promising vaccine			1
the @entity7 said the disease has so far claimed the lives of more than 3,800 people , infecting at least 8,000 people in @entity2 @entity238 , 16 , fills a bottle with a chlorine solution with the help of a community activist who visits promise and her two brothers on a daily basis at their home in @entity45 , @entity44 after they were orphaned by the @entity1 outbreak yesterday @entity66 leaders chided the international community for its slow response to the epidemic and appealed to the world to turn promises of aid into action on the ground ' however , if it is eventually shown to work and if this information can be generated fast enough , it could become a public health tool to bring the current , and future , ebola virus disease epidemics under control			1
' and dr @entity265 , the clinical investigator overseeing the trial in @entity4 , added : ' ' @entity4 health care workers are showing keen interest in participating in the clinical trial to help evaluate this vaccine			1
' praising the work of the scientists involved , @entity271 of the @entity85 , said : ' @entity1 is among the most urgent international public health issues we are facing			0
' this research will play a key role in helping to solve it ... ( the scientists ) have done an extraordinary job , and are working hard to contribute their expertise to the worldwide effort to fight this virus			0
' but it is likely to be months before any effective vaccine will be made available			1
and in the first instance , any small quantities produced , would be given to healthcare workers on the front line fighting the disease			1
it is hoped the move will help encourage doctors , nurses and other health workers - who are at highest risk of becoming infected - to join the fight against the disease in @entity2			1
the vaccine was developed at the @entity299			0
ebola vaccine trials are also underway in the @entity120 , led by @entity301 and the @entity302 , and in the @entity304 , at the @entity303			0
while @entity4 is yet to sucummb to the spread of the vicious disease , experts say it is vital vaccines are trialled in @entity2 .			2

two health workers in @entity4 have received an experimental vaccine
the new clinical trial launched on october 8 and another 37 @entity66 medics will receive the vaccine
a second @entity66 clinical trial is *due* to start soon in @entity213 to run parallel
scientists say if successful trial ' could alter the dynamic of the outbreak '
but it will be months before any effective vaccine is available they say
and the first small quantities would likely be reserved for health workers
@entity7 deputy head @entity57 said the world 's response is not keeping up with the disease , adding it is accelerating in almost all settings
he said the virus is ' entrenched ' in the capital cities of @entity63 , @entity44 and @entity62 - the three worst - hit nations
