@entity1 presidential hopeful @entity0 insists he is not being squeezed out of the race despite @entity3 entering the contest			1
@entity0 , the @entity5 former @entity1 deputy general secretary , has conceded that gaining the minimum five nominations may not be straightforward but rejected suggestions that the @entity10 prince 's decision to run against @entity11 has made things more difficult			1
he claimed that @entity13 is not united behind prince @entity14 and pointed out that the @entity16 football world , lead by @entity18 confederation president @entity17 , had already declared support for @entity11			1
@entity0 is confident that he can become @entity1 's next president and replace @entity11 @entity0 told @entity21 : ' prince @entity14 is not squeezing anyone - look at who the @entity16 leaders are supporting			1
' i am not squeezed at all and prince @entity14 has not issued any programme yet , just slogans			0
' @entity28 and [ president ] @entity29 have made strong statements in favour of prince @entity14 but @entity13 is not united , it is very diverse , and i do n't feel the squeeze at all			1
' i welcome prince @entity14 's candidacy as it is important for the future of football to have an open , democratic process but i am the only one who has placed on the table a detailed , concrete and financially viable list of proposals			2
' incumbent @entity11 ( right ) poses with hopeful candidate @entity3 of @entity10 ( left ) @entity44 expanded on an interview last week in which he said it was easier to win 50 votes in a secret ballot than the five nominations , and said he was still working flat out on his campaign			2
nominations for the presidency have to be in before january 29 , with the election being held in @entity54 on may 29			0
he added : ' i am in full activity and i am continuing the style of the campaign to convince people			0
i am speaking to a lot of federation presidents in order to explain my ideas and i feel very optimistic			0
@entity0 believes he is the only presidential candidate to have laid out details and viable proposals 78 - year - old @entity11 has overseen four terms as @entity1 president since assuming the office in june 1998 ' but i have said it is more difficult to gain five open published letters of nomination than 50 voters in secret ballot			2
' @entity0 , 56 , said this was due to all the confederations except @entity75 , which represents football in north and @entity77 and the @entity78 , having already taken a position in support of either @entity11 or prince @entity14			1
@entity28 has yet to formally declare their backing but its president @entity29 has made it clear he will not support 78 - year - old @entity11 for a fifth term			0

@entity0 says the prince will have trouble gaining @entity13 backing
the @entity1 presidential elections will be held in @entity54 on may 29
