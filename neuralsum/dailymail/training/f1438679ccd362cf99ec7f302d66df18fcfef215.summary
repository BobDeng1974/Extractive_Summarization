by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 08:29 est , 9 july 2012 updated : 02:03 est , 10 july 2012 a top @entity3 executive was yesterday accused of being asleep on the job despite repeated warnings that @entity7 ’s banks were fiddling key interest rates			1
@entity9 was slammed for ignoring the warnings and failing to take notes of key meetings – shortly after a string of newly - published emails detailed his cosy relationship with top bankers and civil servants			0
during a ferocious grilling by mps on the @entity19 , @entity20 , the chairman and a @entity23 mp , warned : ‘ this does not look good , mr @entity9 ' denial : @entity9 , deputy governor of the bank of england , told the @entity19 he did not encourage the manipulation of @entity28 by @entity29 scrutiny : @entity20 mp ( left ) , chairman of the @entity19 , grilled mr @entity9 ( right ) on what he knew about rate - fixing but the @entity3 ’s deputy governor fought back , insisting he was simply not aware that banks had been ‘ low - balling ’ their submissions on @entity28 , the inter-bank lending rate			1
‘ low - balling ’ is a slang reference to banks submitting lower libor rates in a bid to make themselves appear stronger than they actually are			1
in an explosive warning , mr @entity9 said the whole financial system needs to be reviewed amid fears the unfolding libor rigging debacle is just the start of the scandal			2
he said : ‘ we ca n’t be confident of anything after learning of this cesspit			0
’ questioning : the committee heard from mr @entity9 after @entity53 released his note of a phone conversation between the two men insight : new e-mails from @entity3 deputy governor @entity9 , left , to former @entity29 boss @entity53 , right , have been released under fire : @entity29 has had billions wiped off its shares since it was rocked by the @entity28 - fixing allegations and the resignation of @entity53 all financial indicators , such as @entity28 , which are based on a bank ’s opinion , rather than an actual transaction rate , should be over-hauled , even if they appear ‘ squeaky clean ’ , he said			1
@entity9 flatly denied that any senior figure in the former @entity71 government asked him to ' lean on ' @entity29 to lower its submissions			2
his comments appeared to contradict statements made last week by chancellor @entity75 , who claimed that members of @entity78 's inner circle had put pressure on the bank			0
speaking to @entity82 last week , the chancellor said people around mr @entity78 ' were clearly involved ' in the discussion about how to keep @entity28 down and had ' questions to answer ' about rate - fixing			0
in a reference to shadow chancellor @entity87 , mr @entity75 said : ' my opposite number was city minister for part of this period and @entity78 ’s right - hand man for all of it			0
' so he has questions to answer as well			0
' to avoid any doubt about who he was referring to , mr @entity75 added : ' that ’s @entity87 , by the way			0
' mr @entity75 did not mention any other individuals by name , but it was widely assumed that he was referring to former treasury minister @entity102 , a close ally of the ex-prime minister			0
however , mr @entity9 challenged these suggestions in a key exchange with committee member @entity106 , a @entity71 mp			2
mr @entity106 asked : ' did ( the @entity108 chief of staff in 2008 ) @entity109 or any other government official that you have mentioned ... ever encourage you to lean on @entity29 or any other bank to lower their @entity28 submissions ? ' mr @entity9 replied : ' absolutely not			1
' @entity115 : ' did any government minister from the last government ever encourage you to lean on @entity29 or any other bank to lower their @entity28 submissions ? ' @entity9 : ' absolutely not			1
' @entity115 : ' specifically , did @entity102 ever ask you to lean on @entity29 or any bank to lower their @entity28 submissions ? ' @entity9 : ' absolutely not , and if i may just add , what is more i do n’t think that i spoke to @entity102 throughout this whole period at all			1
' @entity115 : ' did @entity87 ever ask you to lean on @entity29 or any other bank ? ' @entity9 : ' no , no. ' @entity115 : ' or any other government minister ? ' @entity127 ' mr @entity87 seized on mr @entity9 's comments and swiftly issued a statement calling on mr @entity75 to apologise			1
' it is now absolutely clear that the chancellor ’s allegations last week were totally false and completely without foundation , ' mr @entity87 said			0
' @entity75 should now publicly withdraw these false allegations and apologise			0
' with the economy in a double - dip recession and our banks in need of serious reform , the country needs a chancellor who works full - time in the national economic interest			0
' mr @entity9 , who had asked to give evidence to mps , used the word ‘ cesspit ’ several times to refer to the manipulation of @entity28 by @entity29 and up to 20 other banks			1
emails released yesterday after a @entity153 request by @entity71 mp @entity154 reveal that mr @entity9 was in regular contact with @entity29 boss @entity53 at the height of the financial crisis			1
in one email sent to mr @entity53 and the then @entity29 chief executive @entity160 , he wrote : ‘ could i talk to one of you about @entity28 , please ? it ’s a slightly sensitive point			2
’ other communiques between mr @entity53 , who was forced out of @entity29 last week , and mr @entity9 and former no 10 permanent secretary sir @entity109 reveal how informal their conversations were			1
messages were exchanged on a sunday and references made to ‘ dinner ’			0
in one email sent on october 21 , sir @entity109 , who had recently had ‘ supper ’ with mr @entity9 , asks why @entity28 is not falling ‘ as fast as [ in the ] @entity173 ? ’ five days later , he emails mr @entity9 on a sunday to say he is ‘ an advocate ’ of finding ways to speed up the fall in @entity28			2
although the emails fail to prove that the @entity3 put @entity29 under pressure to fiddle the @entity28 rate , mps from all parties attacked mr @entity9 amid suspicions that he knew that @entity28 was being fiddled but did nothing about it			1
they quoted from minutes of a @entity3 meeting , chaired by mr @entity9 , on november 15 , 2007 , at the height of the credit crunch attended by all @entity7 ’s banking giants			1
in paragraph 2.1 , it says : ‘ several group members thought that @entity28 fixings had been lower than actual traded interbank rates through the period of stress			0
’ mr @entity20 said : ‘ this does not look good , mr @entity9			2
' that you have [ in these minutes ] what appears to any reasonable person a clear indication of low - balling about which nothing was done			2
in a further blow , he was lambasted for failing to do anything after mr @entity53 appeared to clearly tell him that other banks were fiddling their @entity28 rates			2
mr @entity53 , who resigned last week , wrote a note on october 29 , 2008 , following a phone call from mr @entity9			1
mr @entity53 wrote : ‘ i asked if he could relay the reality , that not all banks were providing quotes at the levels that represented real transactions			0
’ questioned by @entity23 mp @entity213 , mr @entity9 said : ‘ a bell did not go off in my head [ that banks were lowering their @entity28 submissions			1
] ’ he said : ‘ i did not understand @entity53 ’s conversation to be a whistleblower conversation at all			0
he did not say , “ @entity220 , @entity9 , i ’m trying to tell you something absolutely terrible ”			0
’ as a result of mr @entity53 ’s note , his deputy , @entity226 , who also resigned last week , instructed @entity29 staff to start cutting its @entity28 submissions			1
mr @entity9 also came under fire for failing to keep a note of this crucial conversation despite the fact that it is the @entity3 ’s policy to make a note of all important conversations			2
he told @entity237 yesterday that he ‘ greatly wished ’ he had taken a note , but said his note - taking had imploded when the financial crisis struck in 2007			0
when mr @entity20 said the situation at the @entity3 was ‘ a bit of a mess ’ , mr @entity9 agreed : ‘ it was a mess , mr chairman			2
’ disillusioned : police and security guards stand in front of a @entity249 last week where protesters stuck messages to a banner during a demonstration against former ceo @entity53 october 22 : mr @entity9 asks for meeting with @entity29 chief exec @entity160 to discuss ' a slightly sensitive point			1
' he then writes to another @entity29 worker asking about ' the structure and sources of your money market funding before the turmoil began			0
' october 25 : mr @entity9 sends an e-mail to @entity53 and writes he was ' struck that your govt gnteed bond was issued at around 140 ( points ) over gilts ' , ' that ’s a lot , ' he said.october 29 : @entity53 and @entity9 speak on the phone , and he writes a note suggesting mr @entity9 was condoning @entity29 submission of low @entity271 30 : mr @entity53 writes again saying simply : ' investor confidence is slowly ( very slowly ) returning			1
