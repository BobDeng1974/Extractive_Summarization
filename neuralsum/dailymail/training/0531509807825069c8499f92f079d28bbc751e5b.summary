the so - called ' tiger mom ' has been the subject of massive debate over parenting methods			2
however , researchers at @entity5 say they have finally solved the problem of which is the best parenting method			1
they claim that in fact both methods are equally as effective			0
motivation , the researchers wrote , is understood to come from within an individual in @entity15 families , while @entity17 children find strength in parental expectations			1
in 2011 , @entity21 law professor @entity20 ( pictured ) provoked a cultural clash with a @entity24 article , ' why @entity26 mothers are superior , ' that advocated a strict approach – ' tiger parenting ' – common in @entity30			0
the article suggested @entity15 - style parenting was too permissive			1
in the backlash to the article , critics accused @entity20 of over-controlling her children in her quest to make them succeed			2
@entity5 researchers @entity38 and @entity40 suggest in a new study , both culture - centric approaches can be effective			1
motivation , the researchers wrote , is understood to come from within an individual in @entity15 families , while @entity17 children find strength in parental expectations			1
the bottom line is that children can be motivated either way , they say			1
' these findings underscore the importance of understanding cultural variation in how people construe themselves and their relationships to others			0
' while @entity56 parents give their children wings to fly on their own , @entity17 parents provide a constant wind beneath their children 's wings , ' wrote @entity63 , a doctoral student in psychology and the lead author of the study , and @entity68 , a professor of psychology			1
the debate was sparked in 2011 , when @entity21 law professor @entity20 provoked a cultural clash with a @entity24 article , ' why @entity26 mothers are superior , ' that advocated a strict approach – ' tiger parenting ' – common in @entity30			0
the article suggested @entity15 - style parenting was too permissive			1
in the backlash to the article , critics accused @entity20 of over-controlling her children in her quest to make them succeed			2
in the @entity17 family model , the authors suggest , children learn the value of being interdependent with one 's close others , especially one 's mother			1
in contrast , @entity56 @entity88 families tend to emphasize that the person is and should be independent , even from one 's mother			2
the focus is on developing self - esteem and self - efficacy in the child			0
' we were interested in finding out how interdependence could be a motivating factor , ' said @entity63 , who is is presenting the research at the annual convention for the @entity102 in @entity103			0
' the idea was to compare the @entity17 cultural context to the @entity56 one			1
' in four separate studies involving 342 students from a @entity111 high school , students were asked for open - ended descriptions of their mothers			0
they also answered questions about how connected they felt with their mothers , as well as how much pressure they received			0
in two of the experiments , they examined how @entity17 and @entity56 @entity88 students thought about their moms after they experienced failure in a word puzzle task that required them to think about themselves and others who are close to them			1
the research findings suggest that @entity127 and @entity56 @entity88 see mothers differently			0
@entity56 families tend to emphasize that the person is and should be independent , even from one 's mother			2
for example , @entity133 schoolers were more likely to talk about their relationships with their mothers than were @entity56			0
@entity127 more often noted that their moms helped them with homework or pushed them to succeed			0
on the other hand , @entity56 @entity88 students were more apt to talk about their mothers as separate individuals – describing their appearance or their hobbies , for example			0
one defining trait of ' @entity146 , ' @entity63 said , is that they do not simply give orders to their kids without getting involved			0
' @entity146 throw themselves into everything that their children are doing , ' she said			2
' and when @entity17 kids see themselves as really connected with their mothers , they can benefit from their mother 's pressure			1
