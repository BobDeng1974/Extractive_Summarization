it was @entity1 and it was time for the @entity4 top babu to relax			0
but it had to be amid the tigers , in the loving company of his wife , son and daughter			0
so @entity4 chief secretary @entity12 chose to play @entity13 for his family and go on an ‘ all - expenses - paid ’ pleasure trip to the @entity16 on december 25			1
and it put the entire district administration and machinery into a tizzy			2
everyone scurried to ensure that the babu and his family were kept in good humour ; their ‘ pleasure ’ was the top priority for the @entity16 district magistrate @entity25 , the ssp and the rest of the officials who scrambled to satisfy @entity12			1
pleasure trip : @entity4 chief secretary @entity12 chose to play @entity13 for his family and go on an ‘ all - expenses - paid ’ pleasure trip to the @entity16 on december 25 vip travel : it was around 1pm on december 25 that the state government ’s helicopter carried @entity12 and his family members to the @entity16 chief @entity37 pictured with his wife @entity38 ( right )			1
the entire trip was kept as a closely - guarded secret , away from the eyes of the media administrative sources informed @entity44 that the government spent about rs 25 lakh for @entity12 ’s pleasure trip			1
about 23 air conditioners and 20 silent generators were installed to ensure that the chief secretary and his family members feel comfortable at the government ’s guest house			1
sources informed @entity44 that the air conditioners kept @entity12 and his family warm at about 22 degrees @entity56 inside the guest house , away from the freezing cold outside			1
additionally , a @entity60 artiste — junior @entity61 — and his troupe of six performers were reportedly paid rs 70,000 to entertain @entity12 and his family on december 25			1
however , the ruling @entity65 is claiming ignorance			0
@entity65 spokesperson @entity67 told @entity44 : “ he was on a three - day official visit to inspect various government schemes			2
" i have no knowledge whether his family accompanied him			0
if any such thing has happened we will probe the matter			0
” public money but , the opposition @entity76 is mincing no words			0
“ whether the ministers or the bureaucrats in this state … they all are using public money on such lavish activities			0
if @entity12 was on an ‘ official ’ visit then why did he take his family along with him to celebrate @entity1 holidays ? ” state @entity76 spokesperson @entity78 told @entity44			1
it was around 1pm on december 25 that the state government ’s helicopter carried @entity12 and his family members to the @entity16			1
confirming this fact forest ranger @entity92 told @entity44 : “ his chopper arrived here on december 25 afternoon			0
he was accompanied by his family members			0
” ideally , the helicopter should not have landed there at all			0
but flouting all norms about wildlife protection , a helipad was hurriedly set up at the @entity103 spot within the @entity104			0
the entire police machinery did whatever they could to ensure that the ‘ illegal ’ helipad becomes operational to ensure @entity12 and family ’s safe landing inside the tiger turf			1
both the district magistrate and the @entity113 were present at the helipad to welcome the chief secretary and his family			1
government officials unloaded their baggage and spared no effort so that the chief secretary and his family feel comfortable			1
the group was then escorted to the @entity121 guest house of the @entity104 as the staffers and the government officials got ready to “ look after the special guests for the next three days ”			1
@entity12 did not answer questions as to why his family accompanied him or about the expenses incurred by the government for this ‘ private ’ trip the holidaying group stayed there till saturday afternoon and then left the @entity104			1
from @entity132 they took a flight to state @entity134 the same day			0
“ @entity12 and his family stayed here for three days and left for @entity140 in the adjoining @entity132 district by road , ” an administrative official of @entity136 confirmed to @entity44 , preferring anonymity			1
it ’s not that @entity12 , a senior @entity144 officer , was unaware of the implications of using the government machinery and spending government ’s money for this ‘ private ’ trip on @entity1			2
so , the entire trip was kept as a closely - guarded secret , away from the eyes of the media			0
in fact , to avoid spreading of the news of his visit , the government helicopter was sent back to @entity134 on december 26 morning			0
however , the ‘ secret ’ visit did not remain a secret , thanks to a sanctuary staff who captured the babu ’s grand welcome in a video			0
this video has now reached journalists who are now raising uncomfortable questions with @entity12			2
however , the chief secretary appeared unperturbed with the questions			1
he claimed that the visit to the @entity171 was “ official ”			0
he also did not answer questions as to why his family accompanied him or about the expenses incurred by the government for this ‘ private ’ trip ; @entity12 preferred to duck the posers with a smile			2
talking to reporters in @entity132 , before leaving for @entity134 , @entity12 said : “ we are in talks with the @entity182 for ensuring a mobile network in this region as we have received various complaints about lack of communication network in this region			2
" the government is also working on connecting the @entity190 , @entity191 , @entity192 and the @entity16 with two - lane roads			2
" currently , these national parks have single - road connectivity and we are in the process of providing a two - lane road			0
” indeed , the area does n’t have functional mobile phone connectivity			0
and so , sources told @entity44 , the @entity113 and other police officials were tasked to communicate “ important information ” about the chief secretary ’s “ personal needs ” using the walkie - talkies — which are official resources			1
the whims and fancies of the top bureaucrat and his family members were put across to the concerned people outside the @entity104 so that the ‘ demands ’ were met with alacrity			0
the chief secretary and his family members , administrative sources told @entity44 , had a relaxed time at the @entity121 guest house			1
but even as he “ admired the beauty and biodiversity of the @entity104 ” , @entity12 took some time off on friday to distribute the ‘ @entity219 ’ pass books and 1,593 cycles to labourers at a programme organised by the district administration			2
it was @entity1 after all and all - powerful @entity12 wanted to share a dash of happiness with the subaltern .			2
