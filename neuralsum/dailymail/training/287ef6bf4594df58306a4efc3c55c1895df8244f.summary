the @entity1 director of a new action movie that was released this week has denied that a scene in which a @entity5 president gets his head blown off is meant to depict president @entity7			1
@entity8 said @entity9 : the @entity10 is not an attack on @entity7 and that the @entity5 commander - in - chief character is only meant to be ' reminiscent ' of him			1
the film , which stars @entity14 as a @entity1 secret agent attempting to save the world from a billionaire bad guy played by @entity18 , made headlines as a number of critics pointed wondered if it was the first major studio movie to kill a sitting @entity5 president			1
in one scene @entity18 's character @entity36 is seen pitching his evil plan at the @entity39 and he shakes hands with a man who - although he only see him from behind - bears a striking resemblance to the current president			1
@entity8 said in a recent interview that he only used an actor who looked similar to @entity7 to illustrate for viewers how powerful @entity18 's character was in the film , he told @entity49			1
' the easiest way to making the point where people knew that @entity36 was in power was to have the @entity39 , ' @entity8 said			2
' we needed someone who was reminiscent of @entity7 , so that people got the point			2
' he also pointed out that the film 's ending was an attack not just on the @entity5 president but on ' all politicians '			1
@entity8 had previously called the controversial character ' @entity7 - ish '			1
' the @entity39 and @entity7 - ish president — there 's no other symbol about a global power than the @entity39 , ' he told @entity69			1
' if i used 10 @entity72 , most people would go , " what 's that little black door ? where is that ? who is that ? " so i needed to show that @entity36 was — when you hear @entity36 saying , " politicians are s * * * , " you pull back and go , " oh , f * * * ! he 's in the @entity39 ! this guy 's powerful			0
'' ' director @entity8 has denied that the final scene , which features a @entity5 president bearing a striking resemblance to the current commander - in - chief , is meant to be @entity7 @entity8 said he only used an actor who looked similar to @entity7 to illustrate for viewers how powerful @entity18 's character was in the film star @entity14 likewise would not confirm if the character was meant to be president @entity7 and believed the movie was ' going more for the mischievous hint that it ’s him , ' he said in an interview with vulture			1
whatever the theories , @entity8 believes the movie would make @entity7 laugh if he decides to watch it			2
' i know he ’s a big comic book fan , so i think he ’ll go with it , ' he said			0
' i think @entity7 is a good man			0
this whole movie is meant to be fun			0
' @entity9 tells the story of a super-secret spy organization that recruits an unrefined but promising street kid into the agency 's ultra-competitive training program just as a global threat emerges from a twisted tech genius who decides to start a mass genocide in order to save humankind from going extinct			2
@entity18 's character achieves this by turning people into homicidal killers using subconscious signals sent out by his tech company			0
