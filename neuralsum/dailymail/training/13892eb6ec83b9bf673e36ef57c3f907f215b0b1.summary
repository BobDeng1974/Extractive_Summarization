by @entity0 at @entity1 @entity2 secured a merited point for @entity4 as they came from behind against @entity6 to continue their recovery under caretaker manager @entity8			1
it took the @entity11 side a long time to get going at @entity1 but a strong second half performance strengthened @entity8 ’s chances of getting the job on a full - time basis			1
owner @entity16 , sat in the stands , looked elated when @entity2 showed strength and perseverance inside the box to hold off the blue - shirted defenders and roll the ball into the far corner			1
@entity24 scored the opening goal at @entity1 as @entity6 took on @entity4 in the championship @entity24 's left footed shot was so fierce it broke the back of the net , causing a delay local boy @entity2 equalises for @entity8 's side in the second half at @entity1 @entity6 : @entity33 6 , @entity34 6.5 , @entity35 6 , @entity36 6 ( @entity37 46 , 6 ) , @entity38 6.5 , @entity39 6.5 , @entity40 ( c ) 6.5 , @entity41 6 ( @entity42 78 ) , @entity43 7 ( @entity44 66 ) , @entity45 5.5 , @entity24 6.5 substitutes not used : @entity46 ( gk ) , @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 scorer : @entity51 booked : @entity24 , @entity44 @entity4 : @entity52 6.5 , @entity53 6 , @entity54 ( c ) 6 , @entity55 5 , @entity56 6 , @entity57 6.5 , @entity2 7 , @entity58 6 , @entity59 6 ( @entity60 62 ) , @entity61 6 ( @entity62 62 ) , @entity63 5 substitutes not used : @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 scorer : @entity2 75 referee : @entity71 attendance : 15,266 @entity4 had trailed thanks to a “ netbuster ” from @entity24 late in the first half			1
it was n’t a netbuster by the standard definition - as in an unstoppable screamer of a shot - but rather because it did , quite literally , break the net			2
taking in a cleverly disguised pass from @entity43 , @entity24 spun into space inside the area and finished adeptly past goalkeeper @entity52			2
but the ball ’s impact snapped the net from its stanchion and nine farcical minutes followed as ground staff scrambled to find a replacement			0
it caused great amusement to the large @entity4 travelling contingent behind the broken goal and was their highlight in a depressing first half in which they failed to muster a meaningful shot on goal			2
however , things improved after the break and @entity4 might have snatched all three points had other chances - from @entity2 and @entity105 - found the net			1
@entity6 players celebrate the opening goal during their championship match @entity8 is in temporary charge of @entity4 after @entity111 left the club last month equally , they may have left with nothing as a late @entity6 onslaught led to substitute @entity44 being booked for diving after a clumsy challenge from @entity55 inside the box			1
as the home fans begged the referee , replays suggested they had a case and the hosts went close again in stoppage time when @entity52 spread himself to deny @entity44 in a one - on - one			0
the first half had been low key , with @entity43 , signed on a three - month loan from @entity128 during the week , offering the greatest impetus with his forward runs and passing			0
@entity6 approached the game having won only one ( @entity134 at home ) of their last five league games he tried his luck from range early on with @entity52 only managing to gather his powerful effort at the second attempt			0
@entity55 , who looked an accident waiting to happen at times , nearly scored a spectacular own goal when a routine clearing header from @entity33 ’s long free - kick almost flew past his own keeper			0
with the midfield uncreative and @entity61 failing to fire , it took @entity4 34 minutes to muster their first chance			0
@entity63 , who always seemed five yards offside , curling over the bar			0
@entity24 ’s goal was well deserved on the balance of play and @entity43 ’s neat assist a highlight on his first @entity1 start			1
@entity6 's @entity41 challenges @entity59 during their match at @entity1 @entity159 's @entity6 finished just outside the relegation places on goal difference last season @entity6 , who entered the match just a place above the drop zone , retreated after the break and @entity4 seized the initiative			1
@entity2 ’s long - range shot was parried away by @entity33 and sub @entity105 fired a low effort just wide of the post			2
their equaliser was deserved when it arrived with a quarter - hour to play and , in the week @entity16 suggested he might look within @entity173 for his next boss , he may just have a good case .			0

@entity6 beat @entity4 1 - 1 at @entity1
@entity24 scored the opener , breaking the net in the process
@entity2 equalises for @entity4
@entity8 *undefeated* as caretaker boss of @entity4
