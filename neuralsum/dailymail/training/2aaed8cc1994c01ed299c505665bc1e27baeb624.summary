by @entity0 published : 19:35 est , 3 march 2014 updated : 04:53 est , 4 march 2014 promotions for payday loans that suggest they could fund shopping sprees , birthday celebrations or buying an engagement ring have been branded irresponsible			1
citizens advice has compiled a list of marketing initiatives that may have broken advertising rules			1
alleged breaches across tv ads , texts , emails , flyers and even on a sandwich wrapper include not declaring the cost of a loan – which can top 5,000 per cent apr interest – and suggesting frivolous uses			1
investigation : @entity23 is one of six companies accused of ' frivolous ' advertising exposed to children the @entity27 and @entity28 are to investigate the claims , which involve six lenders including @entity23 , @entity31 and @entity32			1
firms have also been accused of trying to normalise loans through daytime tv ads when children are watching			1
citizens advice wants a ban on ads that trivialise the loans by suggesting they can be used for treats			2
chief executive @entity43 said : ‘ animations , cheery puns and suggestions that loans could fund a shopping spree are a far cry away from the reality of payday lending many of our clients ’ experience			2
’ a birthday email from @entity55 to @entity56 implied a short term loan could be used to pay for birthday celebrations			2
the firm @entity59 was issuing voucher flyers suggesting its short - term loans could be used for shopping , which @entity37 said was irresponsible and trivialised taking out a loan			2
citizens advice warn people are tricked into believing they can borrow money for simple treats a tv commercial for @entity23 set in a café suggested a loan could be taken out to cope with unspecified ‘ financial quandaries ’ and failed to show the cost of the loan			1
a promotional film made by the same company featuring 12 case studies of people who had borrowed from the company has also been criticised			2
citizens advice said it did not contain any details on interest rates , while it implied one of its loans was a suitable way to pay for an engagement ring			2
@entity84 ran adverts for its loans on sandwich wrappers			1
citizens advice said it is irresponsible to promote borrowing in this way and that the ad made unsubstantiated claims the firm ’s loans were cheaper than available elsewhere			2
the chief executive of @entity37 has said that every day the charity had to help deal with the ' devastation caused by irresponsible payday lending ' ( file picture posed by models ) a text message from loan - monarch suggested the company gives money to 98per cent of people who apply			0
however the firm is actually a credit broker which passes on applicants to other companies and does not provide loans directly			0
similarly , a text message from spends4u.co.uk claimed a loan could be approved ‘ today ’ , when it is also a credit broker , rather than a loans company			1
the message said a loan could be offered ‘ no matter what your circumstances ’ , which was either misleading or ‘ very irresponsible ’			0
one of the key concerns about these loans is that they have been given to people who have no means of making repayments , so leaving them open to penalty charges			0
miss @entity43 said : ‘ day in day out @entity37 is helping people deal with the devastation caused by irresponsible payday lending			0
‘ loans taken out to cover a short - fall have turned into a long - term nightmare as people struggle to keep up with payments , and high charges increase debts further			0
’ she added : ‘ borrowing money is a very serious step and people need to be aware of all of the facts before they sign - up			0
consumers can not make informed decisions if the adverts are irresponsible and misleading			1
‘ the complaints made today are a strong reflection on the public distaste for financial products that exploit people and drive individuals deep into debt			0
‘ we ’d like to thank those who have taken time to make a stand against irresponsible adverts by reporting them to @entity37 and encourage others to tell us about other inappropriate adverts			1
’ ' borrowing money is a very serious step and people need to be aware of all of the facts before they sign - up			0
consumers can not make informed decisions if the adverts are irresponsible and misleading ' - citizens advice chief executive @entity43 citizens advice has long been calling for health warning on payday loan adverts			1
it also wants financial services companies to be banned from cold calling which would mean payday lenders could not text , email or ring people out of the blue offering them loans			0
as part of the charity ’s campaign to clean - up the payday loan industry , citizens advice has been pressing authorities to take action on irresponsible advertising and chief executive @entity43 has spoken out about the use of celebrities , such as @entity185 , to endorse financial products			0
the @entity27 will take evidence from the companies to defend the promotions before it rules whether they broke industry advertising rules			1
the organisation has indicated it is willing to ban payday loan ads which trivialise borrowing			0
the firms insisted all of their marketing is checked to ensure it meets industry rules before it goes public			1
@entity23 said : ‘ as a responsible business , our advertising is rigorously checked before it is aired and we look forward to engaging with the @entity27 should they have concerns			1
’ the founder of @entity207 , @entity208 , said : ‘ as a company we have spent a lot of time , energy and money on ensuring we maintain rigorous standards			0
‘ although we do not agree that our advert presents a casual attitude to taking out a loan , nor does it suggest that a loan with us is cheaper than elsewhere , we will look into the complaint as a matter of urgency to ensure that any future advertising does not cause similar confusion			0

branding on tv , texts , and sandwich wrappers ' breach rules ' , it is claimed
