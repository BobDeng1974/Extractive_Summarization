by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 03:28 est , 29 may 2013 updated : 03:42 est , 30 may 2013 @entity3 was embroiled in a costly legal farce last night over the fate of up to 90 @entity7 detainees suspected of trying to kill @entity3 troops			1
lawyers for the @entity10 – given a huge platform yesterday by the @entity12 – claimed the prisoners are being illegally detained at a ‘ secret ’ prison within @entity15 in @entity16 and demanded they be brought before a court or released			1
but when defence secretary @entity20 indicated that the military was prepared to release them to the @entity10 authorities , the same lawyers – funded by legal aid – said they might launch fresh action in the @entity3 courts to prevent that happening			1
held without trial : a chinook helicopter flies out of @entity15 , @entity10 , where up to 90 inmates are being held , it was revealed today defence secretary @entity20 , pictured left in @entity30 , has defended @entity3 's policy of holding @entity10 nationals at @entity15 while human rights lawyer @entity35 ( right ) , the lawyer representing inmates has claimed it is unlawful and amounts to internment they claim handing the prisoners over to the @entity10 police would place them in danger of being tortured , and therefore infringe their human rights			1
to add to the confusion , the @entity10 defence ministry is now demanding the detainees be delivered to be dealt with ‘ according to our judicial laws ’			1
the case had been presented on the @entity12 ’s flagship today programme as the scandal of @entity3 ’s @entity49			1
but last night it appeared more fiasco than scandal			1
until last year , @entity3 forces in @entity10 were allowed to detain suspects for a maximum of 96 hours except in ‘ exceptional cases ’ before handing them over to be dealt with by the @entity10 authorities			2
but in 2010 the @entity58 ordered that detainees should not be released into the hands of the @entity10 because of concerns over torture			2
military vehicles sit in a compound in @entity15 , @entity10 , awaiting redeployment to the @entity3 after returning from the battlefield in training : @entity15 is also used as a training ground for @entity10 forces so the only alternative to detention now is the release of prisoners into the local @entity10 community , with the clear risk they would soon be launching fresh attacks on @entity3 troops			2
yesterday it was revealed that up to 90 @entity10 are being held at @entity15 , including a teenager who has been in custody for 14 months , without trial or access to lawyers in what @entity3 human rights lawyer @entity35 said was a breach of international law			1
but mr @entity20 hit back , dismissing the claim of a secret jail as ‘ patently absurd ’ and warning that the release of the men – arrested by @entity3 soldiers in raids in @entity16 and @entity94 provinces and believed to be responsible for the killing and wounding of troops – would put the @entity3 military at risk			1
an armoured vehicle passes a watchtower at @entity103 at @entity15 in @entity16 , @entity10 he said : ‘ these are people suspected of murdering @entity3 troops by facilitating or planting or being involved with @entity106 ( improvised explosive devices ) at a time when most people are focused on how we protect our troops from being murdered , whether it ’s on the streets of @entity113 or on the battlefield			2
’ mr @entity20 said @entity3 had been working with the @entity10 to establish a ‘ safe pathway ’ for the transfer of the detainees and pointed out the legal proceedings were at ‘ the expense , of course , of the @entity3 taxpayer ’ because they are funded by the legal aid system			1
‘ we want nothing more than to be able to hand these people over , ’ he said			2
and last night the @entity126 said it had found a ‘ safe route ’ to hand over the prisoners			2
but mr @entity35 , of @entity130 , representing some of those involved in the court action , claimed the government was failing to deal with the suspects ‘ humanely ’ and according to international law			1
‘ the @entity3 could have trained the @entity10 authorities to detain people lawfully with proper standards and making sure that they are treated humanely , ’ he said			2
‘ they could have monitored that , including inspections to make sure the @entity10 were obeying the law			2
they have chosen not to do so			2
’ @entity143 from law firm @entity144 , who is representing one of the detainees , said : ‘ we have been asking for access to our client since march and , to date , it has still not been provided			1
’ last night general @entity151 , a spokesman for the @entity10 @entity126 , demanded : ‘ the prisoners must be handed over to the @entity10 authorities			0
‘ they will be dealt with according to our laws , and agreements reached with the international community			0
’ however the lawyers may take more court action to prevent the men being handed over			1
crusading : the @entity49 comparison was made by lawyer @entity35 , pictured , a long - time scourge of alleged wrongdoing by the armed forces in @entity164 and @entity10 listeners to @entity166 were assured that it was a scandal to compare with @entity49 and the @entity169 detention of terror suspects without time limit and without trial			1
breathlessly , reporters revealed that they had been given documents showing 85 @entity10 were in a @entity3 holding camp near @entity176			0
this might amount to unlawful detention and internment , they said			0
a little later a familiar name appeared in the @entity12 reports			0
the @entity49 comparison was made by crusading lawyer @entity35 , a long - time scourge of alleged wrongdoing by the armed forces in @entity164 and @entity10			1
indeed , it was mr @entity35 who led the case that ended with a 2010 @entity58 block on the transfer of detainees from @entity15 to the @entity10 authorities , which compelled the @entity3 military to keep so many prisoners in detention in the first place			0
in january 2010 he wrote on the @entity195 ’s website : ‘ my firm ’s next case focuses on the @entity3 ’s detention policy in @entity10 , where we routinely hand over @entity10 to the @entity10 authorities in full knowledge of the torture , summary executions and disappearances occurring within their facilities			1
’ mr @entity35 , 56 , was a @entity207 graduate who became an articled clerk and then a solicitor in the city			0
he worked for a decade for legal firms , a council estate project , a law centre and the @entity215 ’s charity before founding his own firm in 1999			0
the father of five is also a visiting professor at @entity218 , a visiting fellow at the @entity220 , and was awarded the title ‘ @entity222 ’ in 2004			0
he has repeatedly denied that he is an ‘ ambulance chaser ’ and calls the idea that he trawls for work ‘ laughable ’			0
his firm , @entity130 , made its name in @entity164 , where mr @entity35 represented alleged victims of abuses by @entity3 troops , including relatives of @entity232 , who died in 2003 in @entity3 custody			0
nearly £ 3million has been paid in compensation to the family of mr @entity237 and other men			0
mr @entity35 sent a representative to @entity164 to find and interview people who claimed to have been harmed by the @entity3 , and their claims were brought to the @entity3 courts			1
@entity130 says it is currently acting for more than 130 former detainees who allege that they or their family members were unlawfully detained , ill - treated , or killed by @entity3 forces in @entity164			0
controversial : the detention facility at @entity15 , where the @entity12 said up to 90 @entity10 are held the firm ’s interests are , however , not exclusively abroad			1
it says its mission is ‘ helping individuals like you challenge the unlawful behaviour of those who govern us both nationally and locally ’			0
its most recent highly - publicised domestic case was last month when it represented a campaign group who objected to the use of unpaid workers in @entity261 libraries on the grounds they had not received equality training			0
it won the case and the county council was barred by a high court judge from using volunteers to work in its libraries			0
this was , said mr @entity35 , a ‘ fantastic result ’			0
the libraries are now threatened with closure .			0

eight of the inmates have been held for as long as 14 months
they have *n't* been charged or given access to lawyers , it is claimed
defence secretary @entity20 today defended the policy
