' unprecedented ' pressures on staff in @entity2 mean for the 15th successive week the four - hour waiting time was missed across @entity3			1
but while crisis grips the @entity6 , the latest figures do offer a glimmer of hope , with a slight improvement on the previous week 's performance			1
emergency departments in @entity3 saw 89.8 per cent of patients within four hours in the week ending january 11 - short of the 95 per cent target			1
the gold standard was last achieved the week ending september 28 , 2014			1
but the figures , released today by @entity3 , do show a step in the right direction			1
the previous week just 86.7 per cent of those patients attending @entity2 were seen within four hours			1
experts say it is a further sign of the ' unprecedented ' pressures facing the health service this winter			1
in that time just 92.6 per cent of patients were seen within the four - hour target window			1
dame @entity38 , @entity3 's national director of commissioning operations , said : ' we continue to see and treat the vast majority of patients in @entity3 within four hours , and performance improved this past week			1
' although we have seen a slight easing in the number of attendances and emergency admissions to @entity2 , the @entity6 continues to face unprecedented pressures on its front line services - particularly @entity2 , @entity6 111 and ambulance services			1
' in light of the latest weather warnings across the country , we would urge people - particularly the elderly - to stay in the warm , ensure they have proper medication , get their flu jab if they have not yet done so , and seek advice from their pharmacist or their gps for colds , coughs and minor ailments			2
' in the week ending january 11 , 389,377 people attended emergency departments in @entity3 , down from 407,239 patients the previous week			1
but an increase of around 6,000 patients from the same week 12 months ago			1
of those , 39 , 705 people had to wait longer than four hours to be seen , down from 53,681			1
there were also high levels of emergency admissions , with a total of 105,200 - up 3,400 on the same week last year			1
the number of patients waiting more than four hours for admission after attending an @entity2 unit was 11,980 , down from 16,324 in the previous week			1
the latest figures show that on average more than 4,000 hospital beds a day were occupied by patients whose discharge was delayed , the highest point this year and worse than at any point last winter			1
the nhs 111 service took 255,000 calls for the week ending january 11 , down from 323,000 the previous week and a dramatic reduction from the peak of 439,000 for the week ending december 28			1
figures released on january 6 revealed from october to december 2014 92.6 per cent of patients were seen within four hours - short of the 95 per cent target and the longest waits since the target was introduced the latest weekly figures comes as the @entity94 ( @entity94 ) published draft guidance for the number of nurses that should be on duty in @entity2 units			1
the organisation said there should be enough nursing staff on duty to have one nurse for every four cubicles but two registered nurses to one patient in cases of major trauma or cardiac arrest , there should also be a registered children 's nurse on each shift , or at least one @entity2 nurse with education and training in children 's nursing			2
because demand in @entity2 can change rapidly , the guidelines recommend that departments , in planning , should allow for enough nursing staff to care for higher than the average number of patients who attend the department on a daily basis			1
by increasing weekly nursing staff hours to cover above - average attendance numbers , staff can deal with unexpected peaks in the demand for services and be moved around the department flexibly to respond to changing situations			1
the chief executive and general secretary of the @entity137 ( @entity137 ) said thousands more staff should be recruited for @entity2 departments			2
dr @entity140 told @entity141 's today programme : ' the reality on the ground is even if these guidelines are implemented , which we hope they will be , we are a long way from having the requisite number of staff in many @entity2 departments			0
' not all , but there is certainly a significant number of @entity2 departments that are woefully short of the requisite number of nursing staff that they currently need			0
' he added that @entity137 analysis due to be published shortly will ' demonstrate that you will still need to recruit several thousand nurses across the country in @entity2 departments ' to meet the guidelines , which would inevitably require staff to be brought in from overseas			0
professor @entity164 of @entity94 said the organisation was ' not absolutely sure at the moment ' how many hospitals already complied with the draft guidance			0
' the six experts who have been helping us and advising our committee on @entity2 staffing suggest that the recommendations we have got for the deployment of staff within the department are in common practice , ' he told today			0
he said that better planning and ' anticipatory ' recruitment would reduce the dependency on agency staff , potentially balancing out any cost to the @entity6			0
' if you plan to staff your departments at average demand , you will be understaffed half of the time , ' he said			0
' what we are proposing is that managers should plan to staff their departments so that they are only short of staff , on the random variation of demands on @entity2 , one day a week and that will reduce the dependency on agency staff			2
' so even though there will be more staff available , it wo n't cost the service more			0
' the target : the government wants 95 per cent of patients to be transferred , admitted or discharged within four hours of arriving at accident and emergency departments the challenge : there were 5,573,644 attendances at @entity2 departments across @entity3 in the october to december 2014 quarter , up from 5,294,269 during the corresponding period in 2013 record - long waits : the four - hour rule was met for 92.6 per cent of @entity2 patients this quarter - the poorest showing in a decade - down from 95.6 per cent during the corresponding period in 2013 where people waited : @entity217 in @entity218 had 75.2 per cent of its @entity2 patients in and out of the department within four hours this quarter , compared with 79 per cent of emergency department patients at @entity223 hospitals in @entity3 's @entity224 and 79.1 per cent of @entity2 attendees seen by @entity226 the biggest blow - out : the @entity227 had 100 emergency patients who waited more than 12 hours to be admitted once the decision to admit them was made the toughest week : across @entity3 in the last week before @entity230 - the week ending on january 4 , 2015 - only 86 per cent of emergency patients were dealt with within the recommended four - hour window			1
an investigation has been launched after a cyclist died the morning after she was sent home from hospital , having suffered a head injury			0
the 52 - year - old woman was taken to @entity239 on tuesday , after being found on a street in the town			0
the hospital was facing its tenth day of special internal emergency measures , implemented amid rising pressures with surging demand and a lack of beds			2
the measures give hospital bosses extra powers to call in staff and decline to treat patients , cancel or postpone operations or transfer patients out of the hospital			2
the emergency plans also applied to @entity258 's sister hospital , @entity259 in @entity260 , and lasted from sunday , january 4 until wednesday			2
the woman was treated for a head injury in the hospital 's emergency department , and discharged later the same day			0
@entity265 was placed intitiated special emergency measures on january 4 until wednesday after seeing a surge in patients and increase in pressures but paramedics were called to her home on wednesday , and she later died			1
two separate investigations are now underway , the first a police inquiry into what caused the woman to suffer the injuries on her bike			0
and the second is a formal inquest into her death , which is set to take place next week			2
a spokesman for the @entity285 said it was too early to confirm whether a third internal inquiry into the woman 's care on tuesday within the hospital would also take place			0
the emergency measures the hospitals were under at the time may have made absolutely no difference to the care the woman received , the decision to discharge her the same day and the ultimate tragic outcome			0
he said it would be inappropriate to speculate on the cause of the woman 's death , or comment on any aspect of her care or treatment , in advance of the post-mortem and any inquest process			0
' we would like to offer our sincere condolences to her family at what must be a terribly difficult time , ' he added			0
hospital bosses in @entity258 and @entity260 said that they had not yet calculated exactly how many routine operations were cancelled over the ten - day emergency measures period , or how long it would take a backlog of what could be hundreds of postponed appointments			0
dr @entity325 , the trust 's medical director , said even though the emergency measures status had been ended , the two hospitals were still under ' significant pressure '			0
' while the hospitals have been stood down and its status level reduced , they are still under significant pressure and this is likely to continue during the winter weeks ahead , ' he said			0
' therefore we would advise the public to access @entity2 only if they have life threatening or serious injuries			0
' throughout this extremely challenging period we 've continued to provide treatment to those patients who really needed acute , emergency or critical care			2
' ensuring that level of care was provided could only have been made possible through the commitment and dedication of our staff here at the hospitals and also from our partners across health and social care			0
their response in extremely challenging circumstances has been really exceptional			0
' finally , i do want to apologise to patients who have had their planned surgery postponed			2
that 's not a decision we take lightly and it is a last resort			0
we would like to reassure those patients that we will be doing everything that we possibly can to rearrange their appointments as soon as possible either with us or an alternative provider , ' he added .			2
