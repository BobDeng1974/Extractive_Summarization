employers could use new personality profiling software on jobseekers ' tweets to see if they are right for a role			1
@entity6 developers believe they can successfully assess a person 's psychological traits by analysing the 140 characters they use on @entity10			1
the software scans the most recent tweets , be it hundreds or thousands , to develop a personality profile			2
software being developed by @entity6 to analyse whether a jobseeker is right for a role through their tweets and developers say this technology , which is being tested , could be used by employers to whittle down the number of applicants for a job interview and could eventually be the deciding factor between two candidates			1
researchers believe the software can even establish how emotionally resilient a person is			0
people are classed as one of the five main personality traits - extroversion , agreeableness , conscientiousness , neuroticism and openness - depending on what they write			2
researchers say they can decipher someone 's personality trait by the words they use on twitter @entity6 tested the theory by analysing 300 @entity10 profiles and getting the users to take psychometric tests			1
it showed there was a close correlation between their analysis of the tweets and the results of the tests			0
according to @entity6 , the two ' highly correlated ' more than 80 per cent of the time			2
@entity56 , research director of @entity6 company , @entity57 , told @entity58 : ' it could have great potential for spotting future high - flyers '			0
researchers claim words used in tweets reveal a person 's character traits			2
according to the research , people who use words like perfect tend to be perfectionists			0
those who are deemed more caring use words like ' we ' , ' friends ' and ' family ' and people who were seen as more individualistic used words such as ' words ' or ' school '			1
longer words are associated with people likely to get on with their colleagues and conscientious people talk about their achievements			0
@entity84 , from @entity6 ’s @entity85 in @entity86 , which developed the software , told @entity88 : ' we want to use social media to derive information about an individual — what is the overall affect of this person ? how resilient is this person emotionally ? people with different personalities want something different			1
' the software could also be used to target adverts to people online , as well as in call centres or other customer service roles			0
in previous studies researchers have shown that to get a reasonable match for someone 's personality they need to assess just 50 tweets			1
however , the research has prompted warnings of the dangers of relying on social data when selecting a candidate			0
@entity114 , deputy chief executive of the @entity115 , told the newspaper hiring people based on their online use ' gives an advantage to people who live and breathe the digital space			0

@entity6 claim they can determine @entity10 user 's personality by words they use
software could help employers pick people with right *attributes* for the job
caring people use ' we ' , ' family ' and ' home ' and those who do not care for others use words like ' work ' and ' school ' more often
