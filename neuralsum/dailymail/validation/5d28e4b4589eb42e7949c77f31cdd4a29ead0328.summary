@entity0 says that @entity1 will be concentrated totally on winning - rather than potential mathematical permutations - when they tackle @entity5 opponents @entity3 at the @entity6 on saturday			1
@entity1 , courtesy of successive victories over @entity9 , @entity10 and @entity11 , have put themselves firmly in the @entity5 title mix alongside @entity13 and @entity11			1
although @entity1 ' inferior points difference means they have a mountain to climb in pursuit of silverware , a possible third @entity5 crown in four years can not be discounted			1
@entity19 ( left ) and @entity20 ( right ) lead the celebrations after beating @entity11 last week @entity0 ( left ) says @entity1 are only thinking about an @entity3 victory , rather than checking other results wales are first into action on so - called @entity26 , with @entity11 then tackling @entity9 before @entity13 host @entity10			1
' the main objective and focus for us is obviously winning a test match			2
if other things happen , well , so be it , ' said @entity1 skills coach @entity0 , speaking at the team 's @entity34 hotel on friday			1
' i am sure that we will be kicking ourselves if we did n't win and the other games went @entity9 's way and @entity10 's way			1
' the main objective is to win the game , and see where that takes us			0
' @entity13 will know what they have to do when they play last on saturday , but no matter what time you play , the focus is still the same for us			1
we have to win the game and win another test match			0
' @entity3 's preparations have been rocked by the absence of their inspirational captain @entity51 through injury , which has meant the @entity3 back - row being reshuffled and hooker @entity54 taking over as skipper			1
' @entity51 is obviously a fantastic rugby player , a world - class number eight , and no matter what side he plays in , if he is not playing they are obviously going to miss him , ' @entity0 added			1
' we played them two years ago in @entity34 and @entity51 did n't play , and they were pretty strong			0
conditions were n't great that day , but it was a pretty tough test match			0
' he played pretty well against us in @entity63 last year and caused us an awful lot of problems			0
he is a world - class player , and any team would miss him			0
' i think @entity3 have played some good rugby in the competition			2
' it was nip and tuck with @entity11 early on in that first game , and @entity3 probably just lacked a bit of possession			1
they played some good rugby against @entity13 , and then had a fantastic win in @entity80			2
' they will probably say themselves they were disappointed with their performance last week against @entity10			2
@entity1 , pictured this week in training , have travelled to @entity34 knowing a win could secure @entity5 glory @entity89 passes the ball during an open session in @entity63 on tuesday ' but look , every time we come here it is a very tough game			2
generally , we have been successful , but not by much , so we are expecting another tough game tomorrow			0
' @entity95 for @entity1 will be to set out their stall and build points , like they did in destroying @entity11 's @entity99 dream last saturday			1
' we started incredibly well last week and ticked the scoreboard over , ' @entity0 said			2
' up until @entity103 ( @entity102 ) got injured , which was a huge disappointment for us , it had been nigh - on perfect rugby			0
territory , possession and everything we did was spot - on			0
' the boys have recovered well			0
they know how important tomorrow is			0
it is an opportunity for us to go out and give ourselves a chance to try and win the championship			2
' @entity1 performed a title - winning feat in 2013 after losing their opening game - then it was against @entity11 , this time @entity13 - by reeling off four successive victories and taking the championship on points difference			1
while this season 's equation is far more complex , the desire is unchanged			0
' if you look at the @entity5 , the unpredictability is what 's great about the tournament , ' @entity1 full - back @entity123 said			1
' every game is competitive , and that is why it 's a huge achievement to win the @entity5			1
' all we can do is focus on our game in @entity34			0
that 's all we can do , before we wait and see what happens			0
' if we go on to win it , it would give us that confidence and belief ahead of the @entity140			0
' @entity141 will be hoping to get some points on the board early on against the @entity144			2

@entity141 's side have chance of winning tournament
skills coach @entity0 *insists* squad must focus on victory first
