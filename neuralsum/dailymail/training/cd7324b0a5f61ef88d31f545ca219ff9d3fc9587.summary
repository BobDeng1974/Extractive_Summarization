by @entity0 the fans have been camped out for days , the @entity2 's strawberry farmers are rubbing their hands in glee and industrial quantities of @entity7 are being delivered to south @entity8 : @entity9 is back			1
but it 's not all pimms and strawberries			0
descending on the @entity13 are some of the world 's best players and supporting them every step of the way will be there loyal wives and girlfriends			0
leading the pack is defending champion @entity22 's girlfriend , @entity23 - whose facial expressions reflect the feelings of the nation when she grimaces at @entity22 's double faults and smiles with joy when he clinches victory			1
his biggest fan : @entity23 was delighted when @entity22 clinched victory at last year 's @entity9			1
she 'll be cheering him all the way again as he defends his title while @entity23 will be cheering @entity22 on from the stands , another tennis @entity34 , @entity36 , will have work on her mind			1
fresh from victory at the @entity42 , @entity36 already seems to have inspired her other half @entity43 up his game , with recent wins including victory in the @entity48 at @entity49 a fortnight ago			1
but the glamorous , successful @entity36 is n't the only tennis @entity34 with a career to match - or surpass - her man 's			1
as the action gets underway in @entity8 , @entity53 rounds up the women who 'll be hoping their man is a winner at @entity9			2
@entity23 has been in a relationship with @entity22 for the nine years and he has admitted he could n't have come back to win @entity9 in 2013 following his 2012 defeat if it had n't been for her unwavering support			1
loyal : @entity23 shuns the limelight and spends her days painting dogs and cats and selling them online , but never misses an important tournament unlike many football wags , @entity23 shys away from the spotlight as she focuses on her career as an artist and looks after the couple 's beloved dogs @entity72 and @entity73 at their home in @entity76			1
she 's a fan of the @entity2 high street , with @entity78 and @entity79 among her favourites , and is likely to be spotted showcasing both at this year 's tournament - along with avoiding questions on when @entity22 will propose			2
top tennis player @entity36 will be backing her boyfriend @entity43 all the way but more importantly , she will also be on her own quest for @entity9 glory and is hotly tipped to do well			1
taking part : @entity36 will be supporting boyfriend @entity43 but the tennis champ will also be focusing on her own game both champs : @entity36 was in the stands to see @entity43 win the @entity48 at @entity49 earlier this month the @entity92 won the title in 2004 but has struggled with her form in recent years on the grass			1
tennis ' power couple have been dating since 2012 and @entity36 's winning ways certainly seem to be rubbing off on her other half			1
so far this year @entity43 has taken the men 's singles title at @entity48 and hopes for a good showing at @entity9 , while @entity36 herself triumphed at @entity42			1
rather sweetly , @entity43 credited his other half with helping him to his recent victory			1
he said : ' she 's just been unbelievable , supporting me throughout the year			0
the feeling is pretty mutual			0
' @entity109 's wife @entity108 could be forgiven for not watching him at every match this year , after giving birth to twins @entity113 and @entity114 in may			0
the couple already had twin girls , four - year - old @entity117 and @entity118			2

' my wife does a lot of work , as much as she can			0
and i try to help as much as i can , ' he explained			0
' we have the grandparents as well and all my team members , they sometimes just tag along			0
clearly we also need some help on the road , so @entity108 can have an opportunity sometimes to sleep in a little bit , or come to watch one of my matches			0
' you need to be well organised , but by now we know how it works			0
i am looking forward to life on the tour with the family , and it will be a long time without any travelling after the tennis is over			2
so i 'm looking forward to the next couple of years now			0

when @entity159 played in the @entity173 final earlier this year , he said his girlfriend had n't come to watch as it was ' too far '			0
speaking about their relationship earlier this year , a friend of the couple , @entity182 , said : ' @entity185 and @entity186 are both very shy and ordinary people who like to live simply			0
