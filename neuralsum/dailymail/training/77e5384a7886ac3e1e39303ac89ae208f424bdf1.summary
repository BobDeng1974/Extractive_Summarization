by @entity0 published : 12:39 est , 28 october 2013 updated : 12:39 est , 28 october 2013 two fossilised footprints made around 105 million years ago are believed to be the oldest known bird tracks in @entity3			1
scientists believe the prints found in a place called @entity7 were likely made by birds during the early @entity10 period			1
the journal @entity12 reports that much of the rocky coastal strata of @entity7 in southern @entity14 were formed in river valleys in a polar climate during the @entity17			0
the @entity10 bird tracks were found on a slab of sandstone			1
scientists believe the prints found in a place called @entity7 were likely made by birds during the early @entity10 period a great rift valley formed as the ancient supercontinent @entity26 broke up and @entity3 separated from @entity27			1
‘ these tracks are evidence that we had sizeable , flying birds living alongside other kinds of dinosaurs on these polar , river floodplains , about 105 million years ago , ’ said dr @entity28 , a paleontologist at @entity29 in @entity30			2
dr @entity28 added that the thin - toed tracks in fluvial sandstone were likely made by two individual birds that were about the size of a great egret or a small hero			1
great egrets measure between 80 to 104 cm ( 31 to 41 in ) in length			0
two fossilised footprints made around 105 million years ago are believed to be the oldest known bird tracks in @entity3			2
this illustration shows how the flight landing track was probably made as a bird set down on the moist sand of a river bank @entity55 - pointing toes helped distinguish the tracks as avian , as opposed to a third nearby fossil track that was discovered at the same time , made by a non-avian theropod			1
a long drag mark on one of the two bird tracks particularly interested dr @entity28 who said : ‘ i immediately knew what it was - a flight landing track - because i ’ve seen many similar tracks made by egrets and herons on the sandy beaches of @entity70			1
’ @entity7 has yielded a rich trove of non-avian dinosaur bones from dozens of species , but only one skeletal piece of a bird – a fossilised wishbone – has been found in the @entity10 rocks of @entity14			0
dr @entity28 spotted the first known dinosaur trackway of @entity14 in 2010 and a few other tracks have been discovered since then			0
a drag mark made by rear toe on one of the @entity10 bird tracks indicates that it was a flight landing track the tracks were made on the moist sand of a river bank , perhaps following a polar winter , after spring and summer flood waters had subsided			2
‘ the biggest question for me , ’ said dr @entity28 , ‘ is whether the birds that made these tracks lived at the site during the polar winter , or migrated there during the spring and summer			2
’ one of the best records of the dinosaur - bird connection has come from discoveries in @entity98 province of @entity99 , including fossils of non-avian dinosaurs with feathers			0
samples of amber have also been found in @entity98 , containing preserved feathers from both birds and non-avian dinosaurs going back to the @entity10			0
‘ in contrast , the picture of early bird evolution in the @entity109 is mostly incomplete , ’ said dr @entity28			1
‘ but with these tracks , it just got a little better			0
’ the journal @entity12 reports that much of the rocky coastal strata of @entity7 in southern @entity14 were formed in river valleys in a polar climate during the @entity17			0

@entity55 - pointing toes distinguished the tracks found on sandstone as avian
were likely made by two individual birds about the size of a great egret , which measures roughly a metre tall
finding could help fill gaps about bird evolution in the @entity109
