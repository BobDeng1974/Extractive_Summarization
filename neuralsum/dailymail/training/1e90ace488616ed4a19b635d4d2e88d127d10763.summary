by @entity0 blind to the danger , a gang of would - be immigrants run to board a moving lorry			2
to them it is a passport to a new life in @entity9			1
in fact it is a potential death trap			2
four other migrants died in just one week in @entity14 , it emerged last night , and scenes like the one pictured are being repeated every day at the @entity18 port			1
in @entity14 , hundreds of migrants from outside the @entity30 are living in a camp yards from the perimeter fence of the port			1
breaking in : as it halts they force open the back doors and they clamber on as the lorry moves off ultimate price : @entity51 @entity50 was one of four killed charities say there are more than 600 in the town , the greatest number since the closure of the @entity59 camp at @entity60 in 2002 – and they are taking advantage of gaps in security and a minimal police presence			2
on march 9 an @entity66 man was killed on a motorway outside the town			2
three days later , @entity51 @entity69 was hit by a lorry as he walked to the port			2
the body of a 25 - year - old @entity51 man , @entity50 , was found in @entity14 ’s @entity75 dock on march 14 and the next day a fellow @entity51 in his 20s was crushed to death by a car while hiding on a vehicle transporter			1
it is thought he had been among a group of three men who got on the truck and then realised it was going in the wrong direction			2
a @entity18 police spokesman said : ‘ the @entity90 driver heard a noise and stopped suddenly			2
one of the vehicles on board his truck backed into the stowaway and killed him			0
he was left lying in a pool of blood			0
’ let 's go : they leap into action as the lorry slows down but fatalities and failed attempts do nothing to weaken the remaining migrants ’ resolve to reach @entity9			1
when asked why they were trying to board the lorries , one told the @entity109 : ‘ we have to go to your country			1
’ most of the migrants are sleeping in the main camp on a disused railway line just beside the main port where ferries go to @entity120			1
men gathered for several hours at the junction near the port , relentlessly trying to break into vehicles or get underneath to sit on the axle , but police did nothing			0
when a force car passed by it did not stop and no attempt was made to apprehend the men			0
in wait : more migrants hide behind a wall near the port at a second location , migrants were able to get beyond the port ’s perimeter fence by freely walking through an unmanned entrance before climbing up on a bank beside the road that lorries have to drive down to get on to the ferries			1
the men were witnessed crouching down at the side of the road , which is inside the port , before jumping out and trying to get on to lorries when they were forced to slow down because of a build - up of traffic			1
@entity9 lorry drivers , who are fined £ 2,000 if found carrying an illegal migrant , said ‘ extremely light - touch ’ policing by the @entity18 meant they were ‘ sitting ducks ’ for those wanting to smuggle themselves across the @entity155			1
@entity156 , 31 , from @entity157 , who is one of the migrants sleeping in more than 100 tents in the camp , said he was confident he would get to @entity9			1
‘ i will get there – i have to			0
i have lived in countries throughout @entity164 since i left @entity157 five years ago , but @entity9 is where i want to be , ’ he said			1
‘ we either try to get in the back of lorries , or get underneath and on to the axle depending on how many seconds we think we have when they stop at junctions or have to slow down on the road into the port			1
’ another @entity157 man , 38 - year - old @entity174 , said : ‘ the police do not stop us			0
even if you get caught , the police let you go , and you can try again			0
’ lorry driver @entity178 , 57 , said he does not believe @entity18 police have any desire to stop migrants getting on to vehicles going to @entity9 , adding : ‘ they just turn a blind eye			1
why would they try to stop them ? ' they do not want them living here			0
i do not stop my lorry here if i am on my way to @entity120 as it is too risky			0
if you stop anywhere , you know they will try and break in			0
familiar tactic : a gang tries but fails to get into one lorry ... ... so they race to try their luck on another ‘ even if you drive straight into the port they can get on			0
they just walk straight through into the port and then when the lorries are backed up you are a sitting duck			2
’ fellow driver @entity208 , 38 , added : ‘ it is dangerous what they are doing and being able to get away with			0
they need more police and better security to stop them			0
they can get on your lorry and you have no clue			0
‘ the problem is , if we get caught with one of them on the lorry we get fined £ 2,000 per immigrant			0
at the moment the policing in @entity14 is extremely light - touch			1
you hardly ever see them out on patrol			0
’ a @entity18 police spokesman said : ‘ [ the migrants ] put themselves in extremely dangerous positions – this is the direct result			2
’ he refused to comment on ‘ specific areas for operational reasons ’ , but said , ‘ all areas are well covered to ensure maximum security ’			0
but @entity237 , @entity14 ’s deputy mayor , said he believes between ten and 30 stowaways cross the channel each day			1
he told the @entity109 : ‘ it ’s a difficult situation			0
we know why these people are in @entity14 , they want to go to @entity113			1
’ he called for @entity9 to add to the police presence in the area .			1

migrants are risking their lives jumping onto lorries at @entity14 to enter @entity9
@entity250 died in @entity14 in just one week , and more are *feared*
@entity30 migration ' will bring enough people to fill @entity34 every four years '
