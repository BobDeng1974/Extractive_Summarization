i was suppose to get the 12:42 from @entity179 in @entity180 but i got there early and asked the man what platform the train was on , and he said he did n't think a train was running at that time , so it did n't exist			0

transport secretary @entity297 yesterday described the situation as ' totally unacceptable ' , ' the situation on the railways this weekend has been totally unacceptable			0
' passengers must be able to trust that vital engineering works on the rail network will be completed on time			2
