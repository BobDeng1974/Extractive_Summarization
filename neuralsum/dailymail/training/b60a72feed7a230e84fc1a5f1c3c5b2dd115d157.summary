short - track skater @entity3 , who prefers the 1000m event , looked more relaxed before putting in a final burst which saw her edge @entity16 's @entity15 in a photo - finish before she was penalised and placed in last position			1
within minutes of the finish of the heat it emerged that @entity3 had been penalised for an infringement at the finish line			2

' i have had a few people threatening me , ' she told the @entity41			0
' it 's been a tough few days			2
' @entity43 understands the abuse originated in @entity45			1
the trigger is believed to be @entity3 crashing , when she sent @entity49 sprawling			1
controversial : but @entity3 still has the 1000m to look forward heartbreak : @entity3 's late burst took her over the line in the heat but an infraction meant she was disqualified the @entity56 skater recovered to finish the race and was bumped up to the bronze - medal position when @entity3 was pushed down the field			1

@entity3 's result was initially flagged up as ' penalty ' which was later changed to ' dnf ' ( did not finish )			2
@entity77 short track coach @entity94 , by way of explanation , said : " the referee has said @entity3 did n't cross the line			1
' she has crossed inside the finish line and he has ruled that that is off - track			1
' therefore he is saying she has n't finished the race			0
' she ( has ) done nothing wrong in the race , tried to make sure she was nowhere near @entity102 and get her on the line , but the referee has called off - track			2
' it has been called before but not something that normally happens			0
i looked at the video and you are talking centimetres			0
' @entity113 short - track speed skating performance director @entity111 said : ‘ we are talking about the smallest margin ever			1
there is nothing we can do			0

she was making sure she was safe and she went what we are talking millimetres			0
these things happen in sport and there is no accounting for it			0
