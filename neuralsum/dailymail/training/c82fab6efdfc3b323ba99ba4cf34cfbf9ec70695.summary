by @entity0 published : 19:51 est , 9 february 2013 updated : 03:02 est , 11 february 2013 for the first time , @entity4 's rover curiosity used its on - board drill to collect a sample of @entity9 bedrock that might offer evidence of a long - gone wet environment , the @entity2 space agency said last night			1
drilling down 2.5 inches - 6.4 cm - into a patch of sedimentary bedrock , @entity3 collected the rock powder left by the drill and will analyze it using its own laboratory instruments , @entity4 said in a statement			0
this is the first time a robot has drilled to collect a @entity9 sample			1
first sample : @entity4 's rover curiosity has drilled a hole 2.5inches deep to take a @entity9 planet sample groundbreaking : the rover curiosity is the first ever robot to drill for a @entity9 sample			1
the rock powder left by the drive will be analysed using instruments on the robot @entity30 , @entity4 associate administrator for the agency 's @entity31 said : ' the most advanced planetary robot ever designed is now a fully operating analytical laboratory on @entity9			1
' the hole can be seen in pictures taken by @entity3 next to a shallower test hole nearby			2
as images from the drilling operation streamed to @entity41 , some team members shared their excitement on social media			0
the ' full drill hole was a success ! i 'm sure it was loud and they heard the drilling action for miles ! ' tweeted rover driver @entity51			0
curiosity drilled into a rock named @entity54 ' after a @entity56 deputy project manager who died in 2011			0
pulverised : @entity4 's curiosity rover drilled this 0.8in deep hole on the surface of @entity9 as a test in advance of more drilling to collect samples for analysis to see if it could ever have harboured life drilling for life : completion of the ' mini drill ' test was confirmed in data from @entity9 received late wednesday at @entity4 's @entity71 in @entity72 , @entity73 in the next few days , ground controllers will command the rover 's arm to process the sample by delivering bits of it to the instruments inside @entity3			1
before the rock powder is analyzed , some will be used to scour traces of material that may have been deposited onto the hardware while the rover was still on @entity41 , despite thorough cleaning before launch , @entity4 said			0
the drilling and analysis is part of @entity4 's @entity92 , which is using the curiosity rover to figure out whether an area in @entity9 ' @entity95 ever offered a hospitable environment for life			1
previous @entity9 landings carried tools that scraped away the exterior layers of rocks and dirt			2
opportunity and @entity104 - before it died - toted around a rock grinder			0
@entity106 , which touched down near the @entity9 north pole in 2008 , was equipped with an ice rasp to chisel frozen soil			2
none , however , were designed to bore deep into rocks and collect pulverized samples from the interior			0
it 's continuing mission ...			0
the one - ton curiosity rover has been studying the area around the @entity95 on @entity9 to see whether it could have ever been habitable by microbial life .			1

pictures *beamed* back from @entity9 show small hole surrounded by dust
mission *scientists* to assess dust to see whether it can be analysed
analysis should show whether life has ever existed on the planet
