if you do not have any to hand , paper towel works just as well @entity155 , of of wardrobe organisers practical princess , is also an advocate of layering			1
in previous advice to the @entity159 , she advised : ' make sure everything is clean and pressed before you begin packing			2
pack things flat to stop them creasing during the journey			0
jackets are the most awkward : either wear one , pack it at the bottom or , if it 's a business trip , use a suit carrier			0
' the next layer is your cocktail dresses then your tops and bottoms			0
turn delicates and things whose colours might run , such as suede , inside out			0
' separate your clothes from items that might damage them , such as sequins , by using tissue paper			1
' use your underwear to fill in the gaps and put your shoes on the top , in either shoe bags or plastic bags			1
' the roll method is favoured by many , with creases minimised and space maximised			1
fans of this packing technique advise placing your shoes and heavy objects in the bag first			1
you then need to fill in all the space around them with your rolled up items , and fit your small accessories in the gap between clothes			0
if using a smaller bag for things like swimming costumes or underwear , roll the bag as well once you are ready to pack it			0
while packing a suitcase the correct way is all - important for squeezing all those essentials in , hand luggage is just as important			0
