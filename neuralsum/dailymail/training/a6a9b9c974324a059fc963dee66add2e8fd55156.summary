by @entity0 , crime reporter the treasurer of the scandal - hit police union admitted yesterday that even he did n’t know how much money it had stashed away in its secret accounts			1
just hours after the leaders of the embattled @entity10 quit , the shambolic state of the organisation ’s finances were laid bare as treasurer @entity11 told @entity12 that he had spent years trying to find out how many millions were in the coffers , but rules prevented him from seeing the full figures			1
mr @entity11 , who has been in the federation for almost two decades and held the £ 61,000 a year post of treasurer since 2009 despite having no financial qualifications , claimed that he faced ‘ abuse ’ by branch colleagues just for asking how much money they have in secret ‘ off - shore ’ reserves			1

it also emerged yesterday that the police federation spent 50 per cent more than previously thought on a controversial pr firm who advised using ‘ guerrilla tactics ’ against ministers just weeks before the @entity57 scandal			2
the body , which represents 127,000 rank and file officers , lavished £ 15,000 - a - month on a media strategy calling for a military - style ‘ blitzkrieg ’ to halt government plans to reform pay and conditions for officers			2
a @entity69 branch of the organisation , which was at the centre of the ‘ @entity57 ’ storm , also paid out an extra £ 60,000 to the same public relations firm for anti-government posters , adverts on buses and bus shelters in @entity78 and around the @entity69 during party conferences			0
the deal was agreed just weeks before the @entity82 incident in september 2012 , involving then chief whip @entity39 who allegedly called policeman at the gates of @entity86 ‘ * * * ing plebs ’			0
yesterday mr @entity11 disclosed for the first time to a parliamentary committee that the federation has more than £ 21million in the bank and total assets of more than £ 107million			1
a further £ 4.5million is buried in ‘ number two ’ accounts , but three branches in @entity95 , @entity96 and @entity97 have refused to declare even to their national leaders how much money they have to the astonishment of mps who said the organisation faced a ‘ last chance saloon ’			2
when chairman of the @entity34 , @entity105 asked why mr @entity11 did n’t know about the reserves , he told him that the rules do n’t currently allow the treasurer to see the figures , saying : ‘ i have been trying to find out for a while , probably when i started off in 2009			1
’ the @entity69 branch of the organisation , which was at the centre of the @entity57 ¿ storm , then chief whip @entity39 who allegedly called policeman at the gates of @entity117 * * * ing plebs ¿ he went on : ‘ the funding system is archaic , it ’s fundamentally wrong , that ’s one of the reasons i want to stay			0
’ mr @entity11 insisted that there was ‘ nothing illegal ’ in the secret accounts , exposing him to ridicule from mps who pointed out that he does n’t know how much is in the accounts and what they are used for			1
he told the committee that his health had suffered after being subjected to ‘ abuse ’ from colleagues who did not want to disclose the number two account details			2
amid allegations of rampant spending on wining and dining on federation credit cards , mr @entity11 confirmed that 30 board members had credit cards			1
under questioning from mp @entity139 , he also revealed that two senior figures flew out to @entity141 to source ‘ toilet pods ’ for the @entity10 ’s £ 26million luxury hq in @entity144 , @entity145			1
the revelations came just a day after two leading officials dramatically quit on monday			0
chairman @entity148 and general secretary @entity149 resigned following a series of investigations by the @entity152			0
in january an independent review of the union by former @entity157 mandarin sir @entity155 called for top - to - bottom reform and an end to a bullying culture			1
yesterday he warned the organisation faced a ‘ very dangerous moment ’			0
he said the resignation of mr @entity148 and mr @entity149 could pave the way for members who want to block much - needed reform to be elected as the new leadership			0
he said : ‘ i do think they need to think hard about this because the danger is - this is a very dangerous moment for the @entity10			2
it could be that the resignation of these two people will allow the people who want to block reform , it will allow them to be elected			0
’ yesterday outgoing chairman @entity148 said : ‘ @entity177 ( @entity178 ) is currently in a necessary period of change			0
‘ our purpose as a federation is to act as the representative body for our 127,000 members , the rank and file officers who bravely put their lives on the line every day to serve and protect the public			0
there is a huge amount of excellent work being done across the organisation to support these goals			0
’ ‘ we will endeavour to engage and engender debate around the recommendations of the review as the decisions we make will provide a blueprint for considered , lasting change and guide the @entity10 into the future			2
