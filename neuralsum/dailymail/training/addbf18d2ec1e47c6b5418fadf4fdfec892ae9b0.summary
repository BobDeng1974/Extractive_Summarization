for all @entity2 's faults , you ca n't knock his bravery			1
before taking part in the ice bucket challenge last week , the @entity4 nominated his old boss sir @entity7 to suffer the same freezing fate			1
it raised a few nervous chuckles inside the @entity12 camp but it would have to be an icy day in hell before @entity7 accepts this challenge , especially from a player who has flopped so spectacularly			2
@entity7 had such sky - high hopes for @entity2			1
back in 2007 , he was going to be the new @entity18 and the long - term replacement for @entity20			1
decline : @entity2 tries to stem the flow of goals in @entity12 's 4 - 0 humiliation at @entity24 too little , too late : @entity2 tries in vain to stop @entity24 ' @entity26 from scoring their second goal overpowered : the @entity4 , making a rare start for @entity12 , is outmuscled by @entity29 misery : @entity2 ( second right ) looks disconsolate after @entity24 score their second goal to borrow the words of @entity7 's scout brother @entity32 , he was set to be bigger than @entity33			1
he was destined to become an @entity36 icon , it was inevitable			0
these promises were enough to persuade @entity7 to part with £ 27m			1
@entity33 had cost just £ 20m , @entity39 £ 12m but @entity2 was tipped to rise above them both			1
today , @entity2 is still only 26 and @entity12 ca n't get rid of him quickly enough			1
there was a time when @entity2 against @entity44 's @entity43 was the new @entity45 and , often , the @entity4 was emphatically the victor			1
now , he is being spun around in circles by @entity49 defenders			0
on top : @entity2 gets the better of @entity44 's @entity43 during one of the battles between the pair better times : @entity2 celebrates one of his two goals against @entity57 in the semi-finals of the @entity59 back in 2011 power - packed : @entity2 was once rated as a very promising player who would excel at @entity12 joined @entity12 for £ 27m in 2007 honours @entity62 ( 4 ) : 2007 – 08 , 2008 – 09 , 2010 – 11 , 2012 – 13 @entity63 ( 2 ) : 2008 – 09 , 2009 – 10 @entity59 ( 1 ) : 2007 – 08 @entity64 ( 1 ) : 2008 @entity65 ( 2 ) : 2011 , 2013 @entity12 and @entity2 hit a new nadir in tuesday night 's 4 - 0 humbling at @entity24 and to say the player was ineffective was the understatement of the season			1
over the course of the last seven years , @entity2 has spiralled from one of the hottest properties in world football to an overweight laughing stock			2
it is one of the biggest falls from grace the @entity80 game has ever seen			0
the man has four @entity62 winners ' medals and lifted the @entity59 in 2008 , but nobody would deem his time at @entity12 a success			2
he should be in the prime of his career but looks like a man winding down in the twilight years			2
he is washed up , unloved and unwanted , with even a few months on loan at @entity92 last season failing to revitalise him			1
belly up : @entity2 celebrates with @entity93			2
the @entity4 has been mocked for being overweight vulnerable : @entity2 has suffered a succession of injuries that have checked his progress scuffle : fighting with @entity99 after @entity101 's triumph in the @entity103 semi-final in 2011 @entity2 is a lost talent and the @entity4 legend @entity105 summed up his demise in a recent interview with fourfourtwo magazine			1
' when [ @entity4 ] move to the @entity62 , i think they become more disciplined , get to know the importance of the collective game and develop the tactical part			2
' the point is to learn all this without losing technique			0
if they can not do this , it 's their fault			0
' @entity2 is a classic case			2
if you remember him as a young player , he was pretty much like @entity123 , but after playing there he became predictable			0
' but he 's the only one to blame for this			0
it 's not down to the @entity62			0
' little wonder the @entity4 national team selectors turned their back on him six years ago , they could see any skill had been sacrificed and there was n't a lot left			2
for someone billed as a devoted , box - to - box midfielder , it is surprising that fitness has been such an issue			0
in 71 starts for @entity12 , he has finished only 20 games			2
benched : with @entity143 on the bench at @entity36			0
it has become a familiar vantage point for the @entity4 unwanted : @entity147 included @entity2 in just eight games before sending him out on loan injuries to his knee , hamstring and calf have all struck over the last four seasons but , when fit , @entity2 has been unwilling to put in the effort to try and impress			1
@entity7 gave up on him long before his retirement and @entity147 included him only eight times , usually in short cameos from the bench			0
@entity160 has given every member of his squad a fair hearing but his inclusion at stadium : mk came only as a result of a debilitating injury crisis			0
now the future is uncertain			0
@entity2 is part of the deadwood the @entity172 wants off the wage bill , yet no one seems willing to take him			0
there was talk of a return to @entity92 for another loan spell but their interest has cooled			1
@entity12 will listen to any offers			0
it is , alas , a classic case of massive potential unfulfilled			0
@entity2 's nomination of @entity7 for the ice bucket challenge may well be the most memorable thing he does this season			1

@entity191 job : @entity2 spent time on loan at @entity92 last season @entity194 blames injuries , errors and luck			1

@entity2 was again poor in @entity12 's 4 - 0 humbling at @entity24
the @entity4 , who cost @entity12 £ 27m in 2007 , has long been in decline
he spent the second half of last season on loan at @entity92
now , he is unwanted by @entity160 and his future is uncertain
at 26 , @entity2 should be in the prime of his career
but he looks destined to spend another season on the *sidelines*
