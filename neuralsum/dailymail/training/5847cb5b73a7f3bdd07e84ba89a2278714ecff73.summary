@entity0 has urged @entity1 to retain @entity2 with the @entity6 driver ’s @entity4 future hanging in limbo			1
@entity1 will discuss their line - up for next season at a board meeting on thursday and it is likely that @entity2 will make way for @entity13 who re-joins the team from @entity15			1
the @entity16 is set to be partnered with the more affordable @entity17 , who managed less than half of @entity2 ’s points tally this season , or the team ’s even younger protege @entity21			1
@entity2 speaks to @entity24 driver @entity23 before the final race of the season in @entity27 , with the @entity28 's @entity4 future hanging in the balance following the arrival of @entity13 at @entity1 @entity2 tours the circuit with @entity13 following in the background during the @entity34 ‘ if you just look at results then @entity2 is the guy who should be in that seat next year ’ , said @entity0 , who spent nine seasons with @entity1			1
‘ he has outperformed and outscored his team - mate and that has nothing to do with personality or his nationality			0
but unfortunately for @entity2 , the business of @entity4 is what funds the sport so he may well be a casualty			2
’ @entity13 ’s move back to the team he left so acrimoniously in 2007 is expected to net him £ 25million - a - year			1
@entity2 currently earns about £ 13m against @entity17 ’s £ 500,000			2
‘ i do n’t know this for a fact , but there are all sorts of behind - the - scenes shareholding wrangling which is all about funding , ’ added @entity0			0
@entity13 has rejoined @entity1 for the 2015 season and is likely to be partnered by @entity17 , @entity2 or rookie @entity21 fans have urged @entity1 to keep hold of @entity2 with the @entity28 having outperformed @entity17 in 2014 @entity0 has called on @entity1 to retain @entity2 for the 2015 season @entity0 is offering the once in a lifetime experience to race around the @entity61			1
for more information and to bid head to @entity64 ‘ i believe some of the partners already involved with @entity1 are @entity67 companies so they are going to be supportive of @entity17			0
‘ he is a nice lad and has a bright future ahead of him , but @entity2 has got a lot of public support			0
he is a well - known , recognisable , likeable face , an asset to @entity4 and to @entity1			1
’ @entity2 will end a 15 - year career if he is not retained by @entity1 , and the @entity74 has already explored options outside of the sport , most notably the @entity77			1
but @entity1 ’s failure to determine his future before the season finale and thus depriving @entity2 , the 2009 world champion , an opportunity of a public farewell in @entity27 , has attracted widespread criticism			1
‘ @entity1 are in a public sport and the heroes of the sport are the drivers , ’ said @entity0 , a 13 - time race winner			2
‘ they are still the ones that get the public support because they humanise the raw dream of being able to drive a grand prix car			0
with that in mind i ca n’t help but think it has n’t been @entity1 ’s best year of @entity94 ‘ the occasion of life and sport is that it is not like @entity2 can come back in @entity99 and blow everyone a kiss			2
we have all moved on			0
‘ it would be easy to drop a one liner and say it is not right , but if you are a rational individual then you have to look at the bigger picture			0
‘ did he deserve to be treated with a little bit more respect given his time in the sport ? yes , i certainly think that is a valid argument			0
’ social enterprise and charity auction platform , @entity115 , officially launches in the @entity6 with a once in a lifetime experience to race around the @entity117 with @entity0 in a @entity118			0
for more information and to bid head to www.charitystars.com the money raised from the auction will be going to @entity123 www.laureus.com			0

@entity13 to make @entity1 return for 2015 season
@entity2 could be cut despite outperforming @entity17
@entity21 also in the hat to partner double world champion
@entity0 believes shareholding *disputes* at @entity1 could lead to @entity2 being driven out of @entity4 after a 15 - year career
