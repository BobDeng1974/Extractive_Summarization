by @entity1 reporter published : 23:58 est , 4 april 2013 updated : 02:12 est , 5 april 2013 criticized : professor @entity2 of the @entity3 is under fire after a blog post that questions whether it 's should be illegal to rape someone if they wo n't mentally or physically remember it a @entity3 professor will keep his job despite uproar after he posed hypothetical questions about whether the rape of an unconscious person should be illegal			1
professor @entity2 's provocative blog post followed the conviction last month of two high school football players in @entity19 , @entity20 , on charges they raped a drunken 16 - year - old girl			1
' as long as i 'm safely unconscious and therefore shielded from the costs of an assault , why should n't the rest of the world ( or more specifically my attackers ) be allowed to reap the benefits ? ' @entity2 wrote in a blog entitled ' censorship , @entity32 and @entity19			1
' the question was posed as part of a series of questions asking whether psychic harm should influence public policy			0
although published last month , the blog has gained recent widespread attention since appearing on the website @entity42 late last week			2
by thursday , an online student petition seeking @entity45 's censure had more than 500 signatures and the women 's rights group @entity47 had called for @entity45 's firing			2
a protest is planned for monday outside @entity45 's class			2
' the illegality of rape is not a debatable issue , that 's the bottom line , ' said graduate student @entity54 , who posted the student petition on @entity56			2
in a lengthy follow - up blog post on wednesday , @entity45 , an economics professor , said the original post ' was laden with unrealistic hypotheticals ' and that he regretted some things about it			1
' these things are dashed off pretty quickly , not pored over for months the way a journal article might be , ' he wrote			0
' they 're meant as fodder for thought , and sometimes they work better than other times			1
critical thinking : @entity45 , seen speaking at @entity70 in 2012 , posed the question as part of a series of questions asking whether psychic harm should influence public policy ' it was a post about where to draw lines between purely psychic harm that should receive policy weight and purely psychic harm that should n't , ' he said			1
@entity2 said by email thursday that the follow - up post said everything he had to say on the topic			1
the original post referred to the @entity19 case in parentheses : ' let 's suppose that you , or i , or someone we love , or someone we care about from afar , ' he wrote , ' is raped while unconscious in a way that causes no direct physical harm - no injury , no pregnancy , no disease transmission			1
( note : the @entity19 rape victim , according to all the accounts i 've read , was not even aware that she 'd been sexually assaulted until she learned about it from the @entity106 some days later			1
) ' despite the lack of physical damage , we are shocked , appalled and horrified at the thought of being treated in this way , and suffer deep trauma as a result , ' he wrote			0
' ought the law discourage such acts of rape ? should they be illegal ? ' he compared the situation to a neighbor turning on a porch light and causing ' trillions of photons ( to ) penetrate my body			0
' ' they cause me no physical harm and therefore the law does nothing to restrain them , ' he wrote			0
' even if those trillions of tiny penetrations caused me deep psychic distress , the law would continue to ignore them , and i think there 's a case for that			0
' outraged : some students and activists have expressed their outrage after the university 's decision not to punish or fire the professor for his hypothetical questions @entity3 spokesman @entity148 said the university had taken no action against @entity45 , whose comments were made on his personal blog			1
university president @entity154 indirectly referred to the outcry wednesday while addressing a previously planned conference on confronting sexual assault			0
' academic freedom is a core value of our university and vital to provide assurance that one can hold unpopular or provocative views in safety , ' @entity154 said , according to a transcript of his remarks			0
' this is not always an easy balance , but it is a balance vital to uphold in a university that both values respect for all of our students , faculty , staff and visitors and intellectual freedom			0
' a year ago , @entity154 responded to another of @entity45 's blog posts , this one supporting conservative talk show host @entity181 's criticism of @entity184 law student @entity183 after she testified to congressional @entity185 that she wanted her college health plan to cover her birth control			2
while @entity181 branded @entity183 ' a slut , ' @entity188 wrote that the right word would be closer to ' extortionist			0
' ' i am outraged that any professor would demean a student in this fashion , ' @entity154 wrote .			0

professor @entity2 of @entity3 specifically mentioned the @entity19 , @entity20 rape case in his blog
