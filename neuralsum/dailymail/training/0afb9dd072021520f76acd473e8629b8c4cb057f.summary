@entity2 , 35 , snapped the blurry image of the twister , which has now been classified the widest on record , from out the window of his moving pick up and sent it to pal @entity17 at around 6:05 p.m. ' he said , " i 'm having fun , ' " @entity18 recalled on monday			1
soon after , the father - of - two was dead			2

he said @entity2 told him he was riding around chasing the storms ... ' i said " you better quit that ! " and , then , i guess he was en route to the position that he got in because he said , " there goes @entity44 ! " he said , " you might even see me on tv			2
" and , then a few seconds later , he said , " oop , there 's @entity49 ! " ' when he received the worryingly close photograph , he picked up the phone and heard a loud popping noise coming from @entity2 's end			1
his pal cursed and asked if he heard the ominous sound			2
last photo : @entity2 send @entity18 this photo minutes before the twister pictured killed him huge : the deadly tornado that plowed through an area near @entity60 last week was even larger and more powerful than previously estimated - a record 2.6 miles wide with winds that reached nearly 300 mph , just shy of the strongest winds ever measured ' i said , " yeah , i heard it			1
what was it ? " and he said , " it 's debris hitting my pickup			1
" i said , " you better get your ass out of there			0
" ' then the phone went dead			2

@entity77 is the latest victim to be named			0

the tornado that struck @entity4 on friday night is believed to be the widest on record in the @entity89 at 2.6 miles across , the @entity86 reported on tuesday			1
victims : professional storm chasers @entity92 , center , partner @entity94 , left , and son @entity95 , right , also died in friday 's storm the may 31 twister beat the previous record , a 2.5 - mile wide storm that struck @entity100 , @entity101 , on may 22 , 2004			1

eighteen people died in the storm and subsequent flooding , including three storm chasers			1
the @entity60 area also saw an @entity103 tornado on may 20			0
that one raked @entity128 , a suburb 25 miles southeast of @entity4 , and killed 24 people			1
@entity128 was hit in 1999 by another @entity103 , which had the strongest winds ever measured on earth : 302 mph			0
the massive tornado that formed friday avoided highly populated metro areas , a fact that almost certainly saved lives			0
winds were at their most powerful in areas devoid of structures , said @entity140 , chief warning coordination meteorologist for the weather service 's office in @entity143			0
' any house would have been completely swept clean on the foundation , ' @entity140 said			0
the twister marched through the countryside between @entity4 and @entity148 , a region of largely rural farm and grazing land			1
most of the destruction came toward the end of the tornado 's 16.2 - mile path along @entity84 , where several motorists were killed when their vehicles were tossed around			2
like many @entity160 cities , the @entity60 metropolitan area continues to expand in the suburbs , but the rapid growth has n't quite reached as far west as where friday 's tornado tracked			0
@entity165 , a senior policy fellow of the @entity166 , said the continued growth of cities in tornado - prone areas makes it only a matter of time before another monstrous twister hits a heavily populated area			2
' you dodged a bullet , ' @entity165 said			0
' you lay that path over @entity60 , and you have devastation of biblical proportions			0
in @entity4 , the city of 18,000 suffered significant damage , including to its vocational - technical center and a cattle stockyard that was reduced to a pile of twisted metal			1
but mayor @entity184 said it could have been worse had the twister passed to the north			0
' if it was two more miles this way , it would have wiped out all of downtown , almost every one of our subdivisions and almost all of our businesses , ' @entity184 said			0
' it would have taken out everything			0
' the @entity103 storm that hit @entity128 decimated neighborhoods			0
' it 's very scary ... i do n't think a normal person can fathom just how scary , ' @entity184 said			0
' i do n't think they realize how lucky @entity4 was			2
' the storm 's 2.6 - mile - wide path surpassed a record set in 2004 in @entity100 , @entity101			1
and it would have made the storm hard to recognize up close , @entity140 said			0
' a 2 1/2 - mile wide tornado would not look like a tornado to a lot of people , ' @entity140 said , explaining that the twister would not have a tapered funnel and would instead resemble a dark cloud hanging below the horizon			1
@entity215 , a meteorologist for the @entity217 's @entity216 in @entity143 , said may in @entity23 is a time of weather transition , offering the perfect fuel for violent thunderstorms that can produce tornadoes - a combination of warm , moist air combined with cooler jet stream energy that causes massive instability in the atmosphere			1
' in these past two events , we 've had a lot of unstable air sitting around , a lot of moisture and warm air , ' @entity215 said			0
' that provides the fuel for thunderstorm development			0

@entity2 , 35 , snapped the blurry image of the twister and sent it to pal @entity17 ' @entity240 at around 6:05 p.m. on friday
the friends later spoke and @entity2 described debris hitting his pick - up before the phone went dead
@entity247 , which struck @entity4 , @entity23 , is believed to be the widest in @entity89 *history* at 2.6 miles across
at least 18 people were killed including three other , professional storm chasers , and a mother and baby now identified as @entity31 , 26 , and @entity254
