by @entity0 a @entity2 woman who was due to be sentenced on thursday for pushing her new husband to his death in @entity5 wants to withdraw her guilty plea to a second - degree murder charge			1
@entity8 , 22 , wants the change because prosecutors are still recommending life in prison , even though second - degree murder would normally carry a lesser sentence			1
her defense attorney @entity15 said in a motion that her ‘ extremely reckless but unintentional act ’ only warranted 10 years in prison			1
new plea : @entity20 wants to withdraw her guilty plea as she ' unintentionally ' pushed her husband off a cliff days after their wedding @entity15 said the request for a life sentence shows that prosecutors ' offer to dismiss the first - degree murder charge was an ‘ empty promise ’ and a way to avoid a possible verdict of manslaughter - a less serious offense than first or second degree murder			1
the plea agreement was reached in december after the trial testimony was complete but before closing arguments were held			2
@entity8 , of @entity39 , was charged with killing @entity40 on july 7 , eight days after the two married			1
@entity40 's body was found at the bottom of the cliff three days after he was reported missing by a friend and co-worker			1
unsure : prosecutors said she pushed @entity40 because she was having doubts about their marriage happier times : an image from their wedding on june 29 shows the couple days before his death @entity8 said at her trial that she was having second thoughts about being married so young and they went to the park to talk about it			1
they went over a retaining wall along the @entity62 and climbed down a rocky , steep slope to the edge of a cliff and a steep drop of a couple hundred feet to a ravine			0
there , facing the void , she told @entity40 that she was n't really happy and that she was not feeling like she believed she ought to be married , she said			2
it escalated , culminating with @entity40 grabbing her , @entity8 said			2
she thought he was going to pull her toward him - and that 's when she became angry			2
' i was n't thinking about where we were , ' she said			0
' she said she brushed away his hand and then pushed her new husband with one hand on his back and one hand on his shoulder , and he went over			0
it was n't planned , but she said it was ' definitely reckless with an extreme disregard ' for life			0
afterward , she ran back to where the car was parked			0
she had the keys in her pocket			0
previous plea : @entity8 is pictured here with her defense attorneys @entity15 , left , and @entity99 , as she leaves court in @entity101 , @entity2 heartbreak : @entity40 's mother @entity102 broke down outside the court following @entity8 's guilty plea in december last year she drove back home to @entity39 , about an hour away , without seeking help			1
she sent text messages to friends on the drive back - but told nobody what had just happened			0
' at that moment , i was so scared , i did n't know what to do , ' she said			0
she did n't tell anybody what had happened , instead making up a story that @entity40 had gone for a ‘ joyride ’ with friends from @entity118			2
that story unraveled when the versions she told to friends , relatives and authorities did n't match			0

@entity20 pleaded guilty in december to second - degree murder in the death of @entity40 in july 2013 - just days after they wed
her defense lawyers say she now wants to withdraw her guilty plea
they argue that her ' extremely reckless but unintentional act ' only *deserves* 10 years in prison
