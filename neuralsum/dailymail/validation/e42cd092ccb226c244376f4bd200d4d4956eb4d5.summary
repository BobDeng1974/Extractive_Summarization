the strike partnership outside the top six , they 've got to be the best two			0
' but on paper does n't make any difference , you have to go and prove it and go and do it			0
' it should n't be ignored and i think it was appreciated by the fans the other night , they were singing his name , you ca n't imagine how much players grow from that			0
