a @entity1 star has been accused of sexual assault after pinching women 's behinds in a viral video			1
@entity7 prankster @entity6 , 25 , has since insisted that all the girls were in on the joke and that it was simply to highlight how people have different reactions to assaults on men and women			1
but the video , which has since been removed by @entity1 , still has viewers in uproar , with some expressing skepticism over whether the girls knew , while others pointed out that he has created other insulting videos , including ' @entity23 ' and ' how to @entity24 with a @entity25 '			1
@entity6 , who has more than two million subscribers on @entity1 , posted the video to his account on friday showing him pinching women 's bottoms after pretending to ask them for directions			1
the video caused uproar - but he has now claimed it was all part of a social experiment ' trick ' : @entity6 pretended to ask women on the street for directions before grabbing their bottoms shock : the girls in the video look surprised and look around them to see who is responsible for the grope the women are all shocked , with some looking around them for the culprit , while one clearly says she does n't like it			1
' it â€™s completely inappropriate			0
it 's against the law , and it just sends the wrong message , ' women 's advocate @entity55 told @entity59 after the video went viral			2
fellow @entity1 stars also lambasted @entity6 for the video			1
' sexually harassing women is vile to begin with , but normalizing it by calling it a prank ? so harmful , ' @entity67 tweeted			0
the video gained more than 1.3 million views before it was removed by @entity1 for violating @entity1 's ' @entity70 '			2
@entity6 , who first gained fame in the @entity7 after appearing on the country 's reality tv show @entity72 in 2010 , stayed largely quiet about the scandal until posting about it on @entity77 on monday			1
' if you 've seen something one way , will it change what you would of thought of it another way ? ' he wrote , before sharing a similar video showing a woman pinching men 's behinds			1
prank : the women look shocked as he pinches them - but he later insisted the girls were all on the prank denial : he later posted a video showing women grabbing men 's behinds , and on tuesday he shared this video explaining it had been a social experiment to prove how people regard assaults on men different this video , which has also been removed by @entity1 , sparked some disgust too , but not the same amount as the earlier video , @entity6 said			1
on tuesday morning , he shared one final video to @entity1 explaining that the two videos had been part of a social experiment to show our flippant reactions to assaults on men			1
he explained that he had been inspired by a male friend who was in an abusive marriage and whose accounts were doubted by police , as well as his own experiences being sexually assaulted by fans			0
' at multiple events some of my viewers will grab my bum and giggle about it among their friends , ' he said			0
' i do n't like it			0
and if the roles were reversed would people think it was ok to pinch a female celebrity ? ' i wanted to do something that would highlight the difference between abuse towards a woman and abuse towards a man in a social experiment with you as unwitting participants at the heart of the experiment			2
' he added : ' i do n't want to turn off a light on a very real and scary issue women face i just want to shine a light on an otherwise dark corner - abuse on men			2
' explanation : on @entity77 , he said he could have carried out his plan in a smoother way - but that he was glad that it had made people think about how differently they treat men and women he added that the videos had all been ' staged and scripted ' and thanked the women by name for helping him put them together			2
some fans applauded @entity6 for the series			0
' to help out a friend who was afraid to admit he was being abused , @ sampepper risked everything he 's worked for			0
so much respect man , ' one @entity77 user said			0
yet others were n't quite so convinced			0
' so were all the other videos where you pressure women to kiss you also ' social experiments ' too ? ' one asked on @entity77			0
@entity6 added on @entity77 on tuesday : ' in hindsight we would all do things different in our lives , i could have executed this neater , but would have it as reached as many people ? '			0
