hands off in the box is our new campaign to rid football of the dark arts of the penalty box			1
whether it is wrestling , grappling , shirt pulling - or the outrageous headlocks witnessed in the @entity10 vs @entity12 match - the area has become a free - for - all for cheating			1
and that means fewer goals in the @entity16			0
for too long , referees have failed to punish players for blatantly stopping opponents from scoring			1
it 's time to end that			0
so join us in our campaign to say @entity24 to players and referees			1
we ’ll be naming and shaming the cheats and the officials who let them get away with it			0
@entity32 boss @entity31 has added his voice to @entity35 's campaign to stop the amount of fouls that take place in penalty boxes across the @entity16			1
the @entity41 campaign aims to rid football of the dark arts in the penalty area			1
acts such as wrestling , grappling and shirt pulling are now commonplace , as was so shockingly illustrated in the 1 - 1 draw between @entity10 and @entity12 on sunday as @entity49 and @entity50 manhandled @entity51 and @entity52 respectively to the ground in brutal fashion			0
both @entity10 defenders went unpunished			0
and the @entity32 manager has revealed that he shares the concerns that many have over the amount of blatantly stopping opponents from scoring			1
' when the @entity16 managers met [ with referees ] at the start of the season , this was one of the things we talked about , ' he said			1
' we said that that there was a lot going on and that were a lot of penalties [ not being given ]			0
' it is definitely something that happens and it is very hard for the referees			1
' equally , there are lots of fouls of goalkeepers – where the goalkeeper is not being allowed to move – and that is a problem also			1
' but @entity35 feels that enough is enough			1
it 's time referees and assistants eradicated bodychecking and wrestling inside the box , just as tackles from behind have been , and reckless challenges are in the process of being now			1
guilty defenders must be named and shamed - if everyone knows who the cheats are , referees will have no excuse not to punish serial offenders			2
@entity50 manhandles @entity52 ( left ) to the ground , while @entity51 wrestles with @entity49 @entity32 boss @entity31 adds his voice to @entity35 's @entity41 campaign @entity102 's @entity101 ( right ) did concede a penalty for this grapple with @entity106 's @entity105 last week @entity108 ( second left ) grabs hold of @entity110 defender per @entity112 's shirt at a set piece in february @entity51 , @entity12 captain ‘ me and @entity52 were double headlocked at every corner			1
’ @entity115 , @entity116 assistant manager ‘ grappling			0
that is the new word is it ? it is the referees ’ interpretation and we ’ll leave it to them			2
that ’s what the referees and the officials are paid for			2
so whatever they decide is grappling , or holding , it ’s in their hands really			2
did i do it as player ? no , i was a winger and did n’t have to mark anyone			0
’ @entity138 , @entity139 striker ‘ there should be an official specifically looking for holding in the box from set - pieces			1
it was like @entity145 in the @entity10 area			2
’ @entity147 , former top referee ‘ hold or grapple and you can expect to be cautioned			0
once fans , managers and — crucially — players accept it as normal , this campaign will have achieved its aims			2
’ @entity155 , @entity139 defender ‘ defenders are checking , blocking , holding , grappling , using force to foul opponents — and too often referees are allowing it to take place			2
’ @entity163 , @entity164 manager ‘ in a congested area how can you judge if someone ’s been blocked ? it ’s part of the game and some people are good at it			2
a local @entity184 referee came in and he was asking me about it			0
“ can you show me some blocking techniques ? ” that was great , he was trying to find ways of detecting it			0
the confusing thing for managers is that fouls outside the area are given as free - kicks , but the same wo n’t be given as penalties			1
there has to be consistency			0
’ and the readers of @entity190 ... ‘ it ’s more infuriating because we never hear from the refs themselves			0
it ’s about time the refs were made to answer the media just like players			0
’ @entity198 , @entity199 ‘ to those saying if there was a clampdown every game would be littered with penalties , that would be true for a couple of weeks then it would stop			0
i ’ve been watching football since the @entity209 and the cheating behaviour in the penalty area now is the worst i ’ve ever seen			1
’ sir @entity212 , @entity214			0
