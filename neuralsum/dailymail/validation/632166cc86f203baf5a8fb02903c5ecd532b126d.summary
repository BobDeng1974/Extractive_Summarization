food : $ 22.62 billion supplies / @entity72 : $ 13.72 billion vet care : $ 15.25 billion live animal purchases : $ 2.19 billion grooming & boarding : $ 4.73 billion the breakdown of pet expenses above is an estimation by the @entity7 based on its annual report on pet industry @entity82 the report says trips to the veterinarian were unchanged or slightly down last year , although expenditures per visit have increased as owners green - light more expensive procedures , @entity65 said			1

@entity127 sales of the animals themselves dropped from $ 2.23 billion in 2013 to $ 2.15 billion in 2014 , which was expected because spending in the category has fallen slightly each of the past several years , @entity65 said			1
there is likely no one reason , he said			0
but adoptions at shelters and rescues are strong , many cities banned the sale of dogs from puppy mills and the lifespans of dogs and cats have lengthened			0
