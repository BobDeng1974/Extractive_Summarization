babies conceived through @entity1 are now less likely to die in infancy , thanks to a policy of implanting just one fertilised egg back into a mother 's womb			1
they are also less likely to be born prematurely , underweight or stillborn compared with babies born 20 years ago , scientists in @entity9 have found			2
the strategy of transferring one egg back into the mother 's womb reduces the risk of a multiple pregnancy and the complications that come as a result			1
the new findings back a previous study showing women receiving a single embryo are five times more likely to have a healthy baby			0
a policy of implanting just one fertilised egg back into the mother 's womb during @entity1 treatment has reduced the likelihood a baby will die within its first year , scientists have found ( file picture ) @entity1 involves surgically removing an egg from the woman 's ovaries and fertilising it with sperm in a laboratory			1
the fertilised egg , or embryo , is then placed back into the woman 's womb to grow and develop			1
there is an increased chance of a mother conceiving twins or triplets , if more than one embryo is put back into the womb			1
multiple pregnancies can be problematic , significantly increasing the risk of complications for the mother and babies			1
around half of all twins , and 90 per cent of triplets are born prematurely or with a low birth weight			2
the risk of dying in the first week of life is also greater for twins and triplets			1
in the largest study of its kind to date , researchers at the @entity61 of @entity62 investigated the health of more than 92,000 assisted reproduction ( @entity68 ) babies born in @entity9 , @entity70 , @entity71 and @entity72 between 1988 and 2007			0
current recommendations in the @entity74 advise the number of embryos transferred into the mother 's womb during @entity1 should be limited to avoid the risks of multiple births			1
dr @entity81 - @entity82 , said : ' during the 20 - year period of our study , we observed a remarkable decline in the risk of being born preterm or very preterm			0
' the proportion of single @entity68 babies born with a low or very low birth weight - less than 5.5lbs ( 2,500g ) or 3.3lbs ( 1,500g ) respectively - also decreased			0
@entity1 involves surgically removing an egg from the woman 's ovaries and fertilising it with sperm in a laboratory			2
the fertilised egg , or embryo , is then placed back into the woman 's womb to grow and develop ' the rates for stillbirths and death during the first year declined among both singletons and twins , and fewer art twins were stillborn or died during the first year compared with spontaneously conceived twins			1
' her team analysed 62,379 singletons and 29,758 twins born after assisted reproduction and compared them with 362,215 singletons and 122,763 twins conceived naturally in the same @entity117 countries in the same period			0
dr @entity82 said : ' these data show if there is a national policy to transfer only one embryo per cycle during assisted reproduction , this not only lowers the rates of multiple pregnancies , but also has an important effect on the health of the single baby			2
' transferring several embryos in one cycle , even if it results in only a single baby , can still have a negative impact on the overall neonatal outcomes of singletons			0
' by transferring only a single embryo , you not only avoid multiple births and all the health problems for the babies and mothers associated with these			2
' it also results in healthier art singletons because there are fewer instances of ' vanishing twins ' or procedures to reduce the number foetuses developing after successful implantation of several in the mother 's womb			1
' but the study , published in the journal @entity154 , underlined other factors that have also contributed to the steady improvement in the health of @entity68 babies over the last two decades			0
dr @entity82 said : ' we have improved both the technical skills in the laboratory and the clinical skills of the doctors and also perform milder ovarian stimulation			0
' in addition , the culture media in which the embryos are first developed in the laboratory have improved in quality , as have the hormonal medications used to help women produce a sufficient number of high quality eggs at the right time			0
' the study carried out at the @entity61 of @entity62 found implanting one fertilised egg back into the womb reduces the chance of twins or triplets , which increase risks for the unborn babies			1
where one egg was transferred babies were less likely to be born prematurely , underweight or stillborn from 1989 to 2002 the proportion of @entity68 twins in the four countries remained stable at around 23 per cent , but it started to decline after that and by 2007 it was only 11.6 per cent overall			1
this decline was reflected in the health outcomes for @entity68 babies with the rate for premature singletons and twins born before 37 weeks gestation more than halving in @entity72 , and also dropping dramatically in the other countries			2
the rate of stillbirths also halved , while deaths among singletons within the first year fell by two thirds , and by almost as much among the twins			0
dr @entity82 , added : ' these findings show convincingly that , while there has been a considerable increase in assisted reproduction cycles over the past 20 years , this has been accompanied by a significant improvement in health outcomes for these babies , particularly for singleton babies			0
' the most important reason is the dramatic decline in multiple births due to policies of choosing to transfer only one embryo at a time			0

implanting one egg back into the womb of mother 's during @entity1 has reduced premature births , underweight , stillborn babies and deaths in infancy
reduces the risk of multiple pregnancies and the associated risks
risk of dying in the first week of life is higher in twins and triplets
