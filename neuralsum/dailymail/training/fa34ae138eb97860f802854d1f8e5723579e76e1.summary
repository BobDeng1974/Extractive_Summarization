in a single second the blinding flash of the detonating @entity1 knocks the solder to the ground in @entity5 as rubble and dusty debris are spewed out			1
the rare and disturbing pov footage was filmed two years ago , but the shock and sheer intensity of the leveling blast still shocks			1
presumably on a routine patrol in war - torn @entity5 , the @entity14 soldier is surrounded by his comrades after the blast and miraculously survived			1
scroll down for @entity19 @entity20 is clear : the soldier is wearing a pov camera at stares up and down the deserted stretch of road in @entity5 while the soldier in the video is unfortunately not identified , the video serves as a reminder of the perils that servicemen and women endure daily whilst deployed to the @entity34 nation			1
at the height of the war against the insurgency of the @entity39 in 2010 , 60 percent of the 400 weekly attacks in @entity5 were the result of roadside bombs			2
data released by the @entity43 in 2010 showed 1,059 ied incidents in april of that year , one of the highest monthly numbers on record and more than double the amount in april 2009			2
the work performed by bomb - disposal experts - made famous by the film @entity52 , which was set in @entity53 - became more deadly as the @entity39 became more sophisticated			0
detonation : the ied can be seen to explode as a blinding flash around the soldier as he walks on through the passageway debris : the ied throws up a huge cloud of rubble and dust that fill the lens of the camera the soldier is wearing on his head part of the problem was that the novice @entity5 army engineers were facing an enemy that had mastered the art of bomb - making and were becoming more creative			1
trained by @entity76 military experts , the @entity5 military 's progress has been arduous because the @entity39 had become so ingenious with their methods of killing			2
in the training session soldiers pass the metal detector past a disused anti-tank mine rigged with explosives			0
a cooker stuffed with an explosive device is placed on the side of the road			0
then there is a wired , old mortar on display			0
one soldier is told to take his weapon off before placing a rock down on a sand mound to mark the location of an ied			2
stay still : comrades rush to the aid of the stricken soldier as he lies on the ground after being struck by the @entity1 in @entity5 @entity99 soldiers attached the 91st @entity100 , @entity101 carry a wounded comrade injured in an @entity1 ( @entity1 ) blast during a patrol near @entity106 base in @entity107 on october 13 , 2012 infantrymen kneel along the side of the road , practising how to keep an eye out for @entity39 fighters who may stage an ambush during an ied - sweeping operation			1
the @entity39 are also now hiding bombs in trees and walls , not just the carcasses of dogs or donkeys			0
they often plant ieds in one area and melt away to do the same in another			0
the engineers are likely to be frustrated for lack of more sophisticated training and they need more devices to detect ieds activated by remote - controlled devices .			0
