by @entity1 reporter last updated at 11:30 am on 2nd november 2011 songs from @entity4 's posthumous album have been revealed - but reviews say she may not have liked how it turned out			1
@entity4 lioness : @entity8 , which contains original tracks as well as covers , is to be released on december 5			1
one song , between the @entity11 , reportedly tells of cheating ex-husband @entity13			1
hidden treasures : the 12 - track posthumous album by @entity4 will be out in december another was apparently recorded while the singer was high on drugs			1
most of the recordings are just the first takes of songs which have been reworked by producer @entity22 who added backing tracks and vocals			1
he had worked with the singer on her two albums @entity26 and @entity27 and was slated to produce her third			0
he says he only spent two weeks polishing the material after the singer died on july 23			0
seven of the 12 tracks were revealed to journalists in a @entity33 recording studio yesterday			0
in one of the recordings , @entity34 , @entity4 bursts into tears , @entity22 recalled			1
the album is said to feature original tracks and covers , one of which is a recording of jazz standard @entity45 with @entity46 , left one journalist wrote : ' it is hard to believe that @entity4 herself – who oversaw every aspect of the two albums she released – would n't have reworked much of the material that is to be put out			1
' there are certainly times when her vocal on a song sounds more like a sketch , even if she was an instinctive artist who appreciated the magic of capturing a first take			2
' musical legacy : the star was found dead in bed in her @entity63 flat in north @entity64 in july she added : ' at best , the seven tracks sounded like the basis for another hit album , although it 's hard to make any kind of judgment on the basis of one listen			2
' @entity73 declined to reveal a @entity26 - era live set opener called @entity75 , an early version of the hit @entity77 , a demo of the song @entity80 , a version of the @entity81 ' @entity82 and the @entity46 duet @entity45			1
he explained of the album : ' lots of people are going to want to remember other aspects of her life , but what we have here highlights that musically and creatively , she was the tops			2
she was a great musician and a great songwriter as well			0
she was n't a musical fluke			0
' after playing the seven tracks , @entity73 explained that he was in @entity64 the weekend @entity4 died			1
they had planned to attend a friend 's wedding with her on the sunday morning , but ' before i could make it from @entity106 's @entity105 to @entity107 , she had gone '			0
' for me , working on a record was a healing process			0
he said he had only needed to spend two weeks of further production on the tracks since his friend 's death			0
' i had a big brother relationship with her – with me , there was a musical space where she could be herself and not worry about anything else			0
and with this record : i wanted to get it off my chest			0
i knew what material was there , and i did n't want to rehash the pain that i feel now , in 12 months time ... these songs , i 'd like people to know them			0
i did n't want them sitting on a hard drive , wilting away			0
' @entity131 and his partner @entity132 , leave a @entity64 @entity133 after hearing the singer was more than five times the drink - drive limit when she died he added : ' i know there were times when she was n't in great shape – although personally , i did n't really see that side of her ; it did n't go on in my presence – but music for her was her escape			0
' a label executive said there was a trove of live material which could be released in the future			0
' we 're not looking to paper over any cracks with this record			0
' we want this album to be good enough to exist on its own merits , and we think it 's faithful to her legacy			2
whether you can hear every lyric on every song or not , you can always hear the emotion there			2
' between the @entity11 the song was recorded in may 2008 , for possible inclusion on @entity4 's planned third album			1
the song is another with a heavy doo wop influence , and ' shows one of the main directions in which she was heading ' , says @entity22			2
it has led to speculation that it references @entity4 's tempestuous relationship with her ex-husband @entity13 , whom she divorced in july 2009			1
but the big and brassy song starts with a spot of whistling and is not a maudlin ballad			2
the lyrics can not be clearly heard – at least , not on a first listen – although there is a reference to ' my husband '			0
' @entity4 was mostly a one - take person , ' said @entity22			1
' going through all the [ computer ] files of her music : it 's mostly all one or two takes			0
' @entity34 love hurts : the album is said to include a song about her ex @entity13 this version of the @entity196 classic made famous by @entity197 was recorded in one take at @entity4 's home studio in @entity63 in early 2009			1
' she said to me , we can make the new album here , ' @entity22 recalled			2
' we do n't have to worry about the paparazzi			0
' she was just lying down on a couch , with the mic in her hand and by about halfway through the song she was crying , really weeping , with makeup running down her face			2
' the song concludes with the lines : ' and when my life is over / remember when we were together			2
we were alone and i was singing this song for you			2
' after the song finishes playing , @entity4 is heard talking to @entity22 , discussing the relative merits of @entity219 and the singer who first made the song famous			1
' @entity197 , ' she says			0
' it was like he could n't contain himself … he had something in him , you know			0
' our day will come @entity22 explained that during the recording of @entity4 's debut album , @entity26 , the pair would play around with different versions of songs that they liked , once a vocal take was in place			1
this song is a reggae version from those sessions in 2002 of this 1963 hit by doo wop outfit @entity238			1
' it also points the way forward to the doo wop sound of @entity27 , ' the producer said			0
@entity244 the first take from november 2005 in @entity246 of the song which appears on @entity27			2
' it brings another light to the song , ' said @entity22			2
' it 's not so much about the production : it 's her … making a direct connection with the listener			0
' so , a ballad to which strings have subsequently been added			0
but not – for this listener at least – a real tearjerker			0
like @entity261 back then : @entity4 in 2004 when she wrote some of the songs this song was recorded two weeks after between the @entity11 and features a guest appearance from the @entity270 rapper @entity269 , whose verses were added subsequently to the recording			1
' he was one of @entity4 's favourite artists , ' @entity22 said , adding that the song in my bed from @entity26 , effectively sampled one of his tracks , while me & mr @entity279 told the story of missing one of his gigs			1
' they had an affinity			0
besides which , they were both born on 14 september			0
' @entity269 references @entity4 's death , when he raps about a visit to @entity63 , and his belief in heaven			1
halftime the song was recorded three or four times in 2002 but missed the cut for the record that became @entity26			1
it did , however , give that album its title , as @entity4 mentions @entity300 himself in the lyrics : ' and when @entity300 sings , it 's too much to take … he pacifies my ache '			1
it is @entity4 's vocal and guitar playing that form the basis of the track , but @entity22 later invited @entity311 of the roots to add a drum part			1
the song starts in acoustic fashion , but when @entity4 sings " when the beat kicks in , everything falls into place " , on cue , @entity311 does his thing			1
again , as with so many @entity4 songs , it 's a tale of heartache and fierce pride			1
' you can try and stop me , @entity4 sings ' ' but you wo n't get the chance '			1
the girl from @entity329 in may 2002 , @entity4 met @entity330 in @entity246 for the first time			1
' i did n't even know what she looked like at the time , but she came in with an acoustic guitar and sang this			0
her voice just filled and lit up the room			0
she really put something into the song that i 'd just not heard before			2
' this 1960s hit takes that recording as its basis , and it 's daft and fun , so never mind that it 's clearly a half - finished take , with @entity4 resorting to scat singing .			1

review says she probably would have reworked album if she had the chance
@entity350 ' tells of cheating ex @entity13 '
another was said to be recorded while @entity4 was high on drugs
version of song in which she cried has been kept on
