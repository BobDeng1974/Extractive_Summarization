‘ i have spoken to a number of nursery teachers who have concerns over the increasing numbers of young pupils who can swipe a screen but have little or no manipulative skills to play with building blocks or the like , or the pupils who can not socialise with other pupils but whose parents talk proudly of their ability to use a tablet or smartphone , ’ he said			1
‘ many of us have seen the brilliant computer skills of some pupils outweighed by their deteriorating skills in pen and paper exams because they rely on the instant support of the computer			1

sedentary : excessive tablet and smartphone use can also cause weight gain thanks to a ' lack of movement and exercise ' ‘ this had not been an issue in previous years and would suggest that because information is always instantly available there is less need to learn and to retain knowledge			1

’ mr @entity111 went on : ‘ it is our job to make sure that the technology is being used wisely and productively and that pupils are not making backward steps and getting obsessed and exhibiting aggressive and anti-social behaviours			0
’ the warning follows research from @entity178 last year which found children ’s access to tablets at home has more than doubled from 20 per cent in 2012 to 51 per cent			1
