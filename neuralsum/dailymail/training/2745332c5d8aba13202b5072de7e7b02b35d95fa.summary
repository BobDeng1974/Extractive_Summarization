when you have a disability , you have to learn patience ' cerebral palsy is the general term for a number of neurological conditions that affect movement and co-ordination			1
specifically , cerebral palsy is caused by a problem in the parts of the brain responsible for controlling muscles , according to the @entity96 website			1
the condition can occur if the brain develops abnormally or is damaged before , during or shortly after birth			0
the main symptoms of cerebral palsy normally become apparent during the first three years of a child 's life			1
they are : muscle stiffness or floppiness , muscle weakness , random and uncontrolled body movements , balance and co-ordination problems			0
some people with the condition may have communication and learning difficulties , although intelligence is often unaffected			0
although she had been unable to secure a place in a school , or indeed a computer , she got round the problem by getting hold of a tv and learning from the subtitles			2
her mother , @entity41 , said her daughter 's determination had been evident from an early age			0
while learning to speak , which was much slower and more painstaking than it would have been for a child who was not disabled , but she said her daughter would sometimes repeat a word 1,000 times until she could say it			0
she added : ' typing with just your foot does n't come easy for anyone , either			0
' @entity8 is not the only example of a disabled @entity1 person who , despite the lack of facilities for disabled people in the country , often overcomes huge obstacles to achieve remarkable things			2
