by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 19:33 est , 12 april 2013 updated : 19:34 est , 12 april 2013 @entity2 , the son of a billionaire @entity4 tycoon , has been involved in channelling a financial contribution to the anti-press hacked off campaign			2
the controversy centres on a £ 20,000 donation made to a body that mr @entity2 , the owner of the @entity12 and @entity13 , set up supposedly to champion free and independent journalism			1
the @entity15 was closed down after only a year when it failed to attract enough donations from outside the @entity2 family			2
but it has now emerged that mr @entity2 is planning to transfer the £ 20,000 donation to @entity20			1
@entity2 's ( left ) wealth comes from his father @entity22 , a former @entity23 agent who owns a bank in @entity25 the move is controversial because hacked off – which helped draft a new @entity28 to bring in state regulation of the @entity30 in a shadowy 2.30am deal in the office of @entity33 – does not itself have charitable status			2
the fear is that – if it gets the money – there will be no way of checking it is only being spent on charitable work that supports the objectives of the @entity15			0
mr @entity2 , who is a personal friend of hacked off director @entity42 , has railed against alleged @entity30 intrusion in the past			1
the £ 20,000 was donated to the @entity15 at a ‘ gala ’ evening attended by celebrity supporters including mr @entity42 in may last year			1
a spokesman for @entity2 said : ' i would like to make clear that this was a restricted donation from a third party to the @entity15 , specifically to be used for supporting the @entity52 activities of hacked off ' the revelations about the money were made by the @entity56 newspaper , which said hacked off was yet to receive the £ 20,000 donation			1
in a critical editorial , the paper wrote : ‘ it may be because some of mr @entity2 ’s colleagues see more clearly than he does the inherent difficulty in using an organisation set up to promote “ free and independent journalism ” to channel money to one committed to statutory press regulation			1
either way , the solution is obvious : mr @entity2 should ensure that any funds given to his foundation for hacked off are returned			1
anyone who wants to help fund the group can still do so , directly and openly			0
it ’s a free country after all			0
’ yesterday a @entity15 spokesman told @entity56 the donation was for a ‘ public interest defence project ’ and its trustees had decided to tell hacked off the donation would be honoured			1
a spokesman for @entity2 said : ‘ i would like to make clear that this was a restricted donation from a third party to the @entity15 , specifically to be used for supporting the @entity84 activities of @entity20			1
in other words , this was not @entity2 ’s money and not for funding anti newspaper legislation			0
and the money will not be given if the donation does not comply with charities legislation			0
’ mr @entity2 ’s wealth comes from his father @entity22 , a former @entity23 agent who owns a bank in @entity25			2
the @entity12 has supported statutory regulation of the @entity30			0
but , last month , @entity94 apparently contradicted the position adopted by his son			0
he said : ‘ the restrictions of the @entity98 in @entity99 – i would think that would be a very wrong decision			0
there are better ways to rectify the wrong things that have been done during the hacking affair			0
’ a spokesman for @entity20 said : ‘ hacked off understand that the donation from the @entity15 will be honoured			1
‘ when it is , the funds will be earmarked for research and campaign work into public interest defences in journalism			2
’ sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			0
