it has come under fire in recent months for becoming ever - more intrusive into the lives of the people who use it			0
however @entity6 's most revealing revamp yet will unveil the lives of its millions of users like never before as it delves into people 's histories and publishes the information in a ' magazine - style ' format			1
mixed reaction has met the social networking site 's impressive new revamp , with some labelling it as ' creepy but beautiful ' and other critics raising concerns about privacy			0
@entity6 's new ' timeline ' feature - a new , deeper profile which allows you to ' fill in ' more of your life @entity24 - was announced with some fanfare in september			1
the ' timeline ' view will give your @entity6 page a more ' magazine - like ' feel - and will , @entity29 promises , ' tell the story of your life ' timeline allows you to organise your life into a chronological view - and you can even add the years ' @entity34 ' today , the company announced , ' starting today , timeline is now available everywhere			1
' @entity29 described timeline as letting you ' tell the whole story of your life on a single page '			2
at present , the ' new look ' is voluntary - but a company spokesperson said it will become compulsory in ' a few weeks '			2
@entity44 described the makeover as ' creepy but beautiful ' , adding : ' @entity6 appears to have gained at least a minor awareness of how intrusive the site can feel			2
' with timeline , it is letting users have a week grace period to tweak and review the page before they spring their entire life on the rest of the world			1
' i strongly recommend everyone use this one week to understand how timeline works before hitting the ‘ publish now ’ button			0
' in a move which appears to try and reassure users of the timeline feature , both @entity6 creator @entity29 and pop idol @entity63 both now boast the new - look format on their profiles			1
the redesigned pages have a more magazine - like photo - heavy feel , with a large ' cover photo ' at the top of the page			1
on the right of the page there will be a timeline that breaks down all posts from a person 's time on @entity6 and allows viewers to jump back to people 's earliest posts with a break down month - by - month			1
@entity6 's new ' timeline ' profiles highlight pictures from years ago - but deleting pictures you do n't like may be no defence @entity6 's creator @entity29 led by example by opting - in to the new profile feature tech site @entity92 commented , ' @entity6 's new timeline has the potential to expose status updates and wall posts from years ago , ' and published a guide to ' @entity99 to adjust now			1
' you can choose to ' feature ' or ' hide ' posts that you particularly want highlighted or hidden - but from the moment you opt in , you only have seven days to do so			1
' when you upgrade to timeline , you 'll have seven days to review everything that appears on your timeline before anyone else can see it , ' the site says			1
' if you decide to wait , your timeline will go live automatically after seven days			2
your new timeline will replace your profile , but all your stories and photos will still be there			2
' the all - inclusive , show - everything approach has clearly made some users nervous , ' time to untag some old photos , ' commented one user via @entity121 in the minutes after launch			0
the redesigned @entity6 ' timeline ' has also been popular with users - although not with privacy advocates exposed : even people 's hobbies , such as film interests ( left ) and which games they enjoy playing ( right ) , will be revealed for all to see as part of the new - look site connections : @entity6 's links with music site @entity134 will also reveal exactly what bands you are listening to @entity139 business magazine @entity138 commented , ' this is going to force users to do some privacy housekeeping			1
limiting items to just your friends seems like a good privacy control , but that depends on how liberal you ’ve been in friending people			0
' a technology class at @entity148 has already created a quiz called ' what 's her face - book ' to work out exactly how well they know people who they are connected to via the site			0
the new look is much more ' picture - heavy ' - and your profile suddenly becomes a showcase for everything you have ever posted			0
friends become big pictures , and the site also posts much larger versions of pictures you 've taken , shared or been tagged in			0
timeline will also be open to app developers , so that the information can be used to supercharge apps such as music - sharing application @entity134			0
timeline has been available to a million developers in an early test version already - but so far has only been available to the public in @entity175 , chosen as a test bed , presumably , because it has a relatively low population - just 4.4 million - and is @entity179 - speaking , allowing @entity6 to iron out early problems with the service			0
one of the new features is ' cover ' - a big picture that you pick to represent yourself , and which forms the top of ' timeline ' , which replaces your old profile @entity6 are keen to trumpet the fact you can ' hide ' features from your ' timeline ' you can also edit your timeline for specific @entity6 users - but the site only gives you seven days to edit before ' going live ' , so this feature may be too fiddly for many the @entity196 lets you review and manage everything you share on @entity6 the new - look format may prompt many to re-evaluate how much they want to share on @entity6 , with some users proclaiming this latest change is one step too far			1
early reactions suggest this development could drive users away from the site , with some fearing the privacy settings could be so confusing it might be easier to leave @entity6 altogether			0
the biggest piece of advice offered so far on the changes is make sure you understand how timeline works before hitting the ' publish now ' button			0
this may force many to carry out some privacy housekeeping on the site			0
when profiles migrate to the timeline magazine format , users will have seven days to scrutinise and approve its content before it is published online			1
but it will be up to you to decide who sees this information			0
to friend or not to friend ? the what 's her face - book quiz helps users establish how many of their connections they truly know users are advised to use this week - long grace period to study the contents meticulously and to make the necessary privacy adjustments to ensure their life history is not published for the world to see			2
after seven days , the timeline format will automatically be published to your profile			1
every picture , comment and piece of information contained within timeline will feature a privacy drop - down menu , asking who you want to view it , whether it be the public , close friends , colleagues or any other sub-group of users on @entity6			1
many users might think they are being cautious by limiting their information to only their ' friends ' list , but this throws up another dilemma : how many of your @entity6 ' friends ' do you actually know ? if you have been too liberal in adding and accepting ' friends ' on @entity6 , there 's a chance you 'll be sharing information with people you barely know			0
a new quiz called what 's her @entity267 tests users on how many people they really know on the site by showing them randomly - selected pictures of their ' friends ' and asking them to identify them			2
based on your score at the end of the quiz , users will be advised on whether to keep friends or delete them before allowing them unrestricted access to personal pictures and other information in the timeline feature .			0
