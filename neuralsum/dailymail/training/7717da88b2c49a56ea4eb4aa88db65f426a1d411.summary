@entity23 , the chief inspector of prisons , said a number of ‘ procedural ’ failings resulted in the criminal being allowed out as part of preparations for his eventual release			1
he said there had been a ‘ failure to undertake a formal risk assessment ’ of the killer and told the justice secretary that it was not appropriate for him to have been released			1
an inquiry into his release found that staff did not review his offender assessment system on his arrival at the category d prison and concluded that staff should have considered his criminal past before allowing his temporary 12 - hour unsupervised release			1
@entity0 killed mr @entity1 on july 13 last year - the first day he was eligible for day release during his sentence for murder			1
within hours of hitching a lift from the prison , @entity0 went straight to the house of @entity53 , 87 , an @entity54 he met in prison two years earlier while @entity53 was serving a 30 - month sentence for indecently assaulting a ten - year - old boy			1
as @entity0 filled a pillowcase with family heirlooms and cash from the victim ’s £ 1million @entity62 home , @entity53 shouted for help from a window			2
mr @entity1 went over to investigate and was confronted by @entity0 , who dragged him inside the house and slashed his throat			1

it was only 17 months prior to that killing that he had been released from prison , having been jailed for ten years for manslaughter in 1984			2
aged 25 , he admitted admitted to police he had done a ‘ bad thing ’ after crashing a car while drunk			0

the house had been ransacked for cash			0

he was released after five years after behaving as a ‘ model prisoner ’			0
the full report into his release and those of two other offenders at different prisons will be published in full when an ongoing trial involving one of the men has concluded			2

he was on temporary day release from jail at the time of the murder @entity0 killed mr @entity1 when he tried to intervene and stop the criminal as he ransacked the £ 1million home after his latest killing , police issued a ' wanted ' poster in the major manhunt to find @entity0 @entity130 , also known as @entity131 , has been described as ‘ astonishingly bright ’ , with an iq of 140			1
born in @entity133 in 1958 , he spent much of his youth in care homes and picked up a string of convictions for petty theft and burglary			0
by his early 20s he was a drifter , reportedly earning money as a rent boy and sleeping rough when his cash ran out			0
he briefly married at 25 , but his marriage collapsed under the strain of his heavy drinking and his continued involvement in crime and prostitution			0
in october 1983 , he was stopped by police after crashing a stolen car in @entity92 while drunk			0
kept in a cell to sober up , he demanded to see the custody sergeant and told him : ‘ i ’ve done a bad thing			0
’ @entity0 had killed a gay man , @entity90 , smashing his skull seven times with a hammer before strangling him with a towel			2
at his trial , @entity0 told the jury that @entity90 , 49 , – who had previous convictions for sexually abusing teenage boys – had played him an audio tape describing a graphic sexual fantasy of having under - age sex with a teenage boy			2
@entity0 claimed he had ‘ panicked ’ and repeatedly struck out at @entity168			0
he said he had thrown the tape away			0
the jury convicted him of manslaughter , not murder , and he was sentenced to 13 years , reduced to eight on appeal			2
he was released in 1989 after serving only five years			0

in july 1992 , he was convicted of murder and given a life sentence , with a minimum tariff of 25 years			0
