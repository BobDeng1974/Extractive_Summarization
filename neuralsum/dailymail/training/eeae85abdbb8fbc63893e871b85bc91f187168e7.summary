a teenager born without any fingers on his left hand has been given a @entity4 - style ' bionic ' limb which was made using a 3d printer			1
@entity6 , 15 , was born six weeks premature with an upper limb deficiency in his left hand which meant his fingers did not form properly while in the womb			1
but in september last year , his father @entity10 , 40 , read an article about 3d printing techniques and contacted an organisation about the niche process			1
@entity6 , 15 , who was born without fingers on his left hand , has now been given a ' bionic ' limb , which took 20 hours to make using a 3d printer a volunteer used the measurements of @entity6 's right hand and a design inspired by @entity23 ' iconic star wars films to produce the £ 30 hand four months later , @entity6 and his father were ' lost for words ' when the £ 30 hand arrived at their home in @entity29			1
the hand was crafted by a volunteer from enabling the future , @entity33 , a global collective which encourages owners of 3d printers to make hands for those who need a prosthesis			2
@entity6 said : ' it is a bit like the one @entity4 had in @entity41			1
' i chose it deliberately as i was going for that kind of style and colour			2
i was very happy when it arrived			0
it was better than i thought it would be			0
' it is not robotic at all , which is great and it feels really comfortable on			2
i 'm able to do things i have n't before			2
' the charity used the measurements of @entity6 's right hand and a design inspired by @entity23 ' iconic @entity41 films to produce the ' bionic ' limb , which took 20 hours to make			1
mr @entity6 , a full - time artist , said : ' i was just browsing the internet last september and saw that a three - year - old from @entity61 had a 3d printed hand done			1
i got in contact with the same charity who put me in touch with @entity33 , a 3d - printing charity based in the @entity69 @entity6 , who lives in @entity29 , said : ' it is a bit like the one @entity4 had in @entity41 ' ' they use a special tool to measure @entity6 's hands and i sent the measurements across online after that			1
' it came the post last wednesday , it was amazing			0
it just came in the post and we were flabbergasted			0
i was lost for words			0
' he added : ' because it is mechanical and not electric at all , it is organic and it is all really functional			0
' it only costs £ 30 to make because they are volunteers we did n't have to pay anything - we are incredibly grateful			1
' within five or ten minutes , he was picking up bananas and picking up oranges			0
' the arm uses strings and no electronics at all			0
the strings act as tendons would do			0
it 's like something off @entity41			2
' his father @entity10 , 40 ( pictured left ) , decided to contact a group of volunteers who specialised in 3d printing techniques after reading an article about the niche process mr @entity6 said the 3d - printed version was ' more organic ' than previous prosthetics which he said can be very expensive and ' more cosmetic than practical '			1
he added : ' this new hand feels like part of him			0
when he rotates his wrist , his fingers clench			0
' it is quite rare in the @entity116			0
i know someone in @entity119 had one done but that is it really			0
' when @entity6 gets older and grows , we can just print out a new one or new parts to fit him			2
it is always going to be printable			0
that is the beautiful thing about it			0
' when @entity6 was born , i thought some kind of technology would be able to help him , and now , 15 years on , we are there			1
' it is great to get the word out there that there is hope for kids , and adults , with limb deficiency			1
' @entity33 - @entity33 , the volunteer who made the model , said : ' it 's a complicated bit of technology and it took about 20 hours to print the hand			1
' @entity144 , from charity reach , who work with children with limb deficiency , added : ' it 's something that 's moving really fast because printers are so accessible			1
' the 3d hands are not as all - singing , all - dancing as they could be , but prosthetic hands for children can be very heavy and cumbersome			2
the 3d printed ones are much lighter and they look funky and robotic			2

@entity6 , from @entity29 , was born with upper limb deficiency
his father @entity10 , 40 , contacted charity which specialised in 3d printing
they spent £ 30 and 20 hours making the @entity41 - inspired ' bionic ' limb
@entity6 , 15 , said : ' it is not robotic at all . i 'm able to do things i have n't before '
