@entity9 won the party 's nomination in last night 's primary @entity1 won his own @entity11 primary in 2012 after being endorsed by then - senator @entity30 , the upper chamber 's resident kingmaker at the time			1
@entity30 left the @entity11 to run conservative non-profit @entity33 just as @entity1 was taking office , and @entity1 has since sought to fill his mentor 's shoes			1
the former @entity38 solicitor general is only in his second year as a @entity11 , yet he is already considered a @entity2 leader and a likely 2016 presidential candidate			1
after making his maiden speech on the @entity11 floor during frenemie @entity44 's filibuster of the @entity47 administration 's drone policy in march 2013 , @entity1 held a talkathon of his own in october over @entity50			1
during the 21 - hour speech that resulted in a 16 day government shutdown , @entity1 quoted @entity53 , @entity54 , dr. @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 and tried to ' make @entity58 listen ' to the problems @entity50 has caused average @entity60			1
the speech , while not technically a filibuster , was the fourth longest speech in @entity11 history , and it propelled him to the finalist list for @entity66 's @entity65			1
@entity1 ended up losing the award to @entity68 , but his selection for the short - list showed that not only was @entity58 listening to him , the whole country was			2
@entity5 gubernatorial nominee @entity9 , left , and @entity5 @entity11 nominee @entity10 shake hands in @entity73 , @entity7 during a unity rally after @entity7 's primary election last night in a @entity77 presidential poll released last week , @entity1 landed in the middle of the pack , trailing @entity44 by six points and beating fellow @entity2 senator @entity81 by only a single digit			1
so far @entity1 has farer better than @entity44 in the endorsement race , however			2
@entity44 's @entity11 candidate in @entity85 lost to house speaker @entity86 in last week 's @entity5 primary			1
@entity81 has not made any endorsements this election cycle			0
in @entity7 , @entity1 's @entity11 candidate @entity10 , a university president , sailed to victory , winning 49 percent of the vote and beating out establishment candidate and former state treasurer @entity94 as well as self - funder and @entity97 president @entity96			1
@entity10 is the favorite to win the general election against @entity101 candidate @entity100 , a trial attorney			0
a @entity103 poll taken last week had @entity10 beating @entity100 by double digits - and that was with @entity94 still on the ballot			0

' @entity1 's success rate at hand picking winners and losers will have little effect on his presidential aspirations			2
it will affect how much power he has withing the @entity141 , however			0
if @entity1 - the vice chair of the @entity144 ' political arm - is able to build up the number of @entity146 who share his way of thinking , it will be more difficult for others in the @entity5 caucus who disagree with his approach to government to stand in his way			1
last fall 's government shutdown could be the first of many heavy handed tactics @entity144 use in the @entity11 to fight @entity101 ' agenda if @entity1 takes the reins			1

' @entity162 embodies the @entity60 dream			0
' ' i ’m proud to offer @entity178 my enthusiastic endorsement because not only will he vote the right way , but he ’ll stand up and fight with us in the @entity11 to stop president @entity47 ’s assault on our liberties and defend @entity60 ’s founding principles			0
' @entity162 faces congressman @entity187 in the june 24 primary			0
polls show @entity190 , who is in his second term in the @entity193 , leading @entity162 by a large margin .			0

@entity1 has only been a senator for a year and a half , but already he 's seen as a @entity2 leader and a national political player
if @entity1 is able to add more *republicans* to the @entity11 who share his way of thinking , last fall 's government shutdown could be the first of a more heavy handed approach by the @entity5 to halt the presidents agenda
