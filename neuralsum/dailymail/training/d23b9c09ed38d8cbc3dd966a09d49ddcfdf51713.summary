@entity19 worked with @entity6 , very much man of the moment after his remarkable success recruiting players for @entity5 , at @entity24 ’s last season			1
the @entity5 manager worked with him at @entity24 ’s last season and has made it known to @entity1 that he trusts @entity6 ’s judgement of players			1

@entity5 are second in the @entity25 after an extraordinary start to the season under new coach @entity58			0
they will fight to keep @entity6 , a former professional player with @entity35 and @entity59 , on the south coast despite @entity2 ’s advances			2
@entity6 , 33 , travels the world for @entity5 and is credited with the majority of incoming transfers since his arrival at the club two years ago			1
