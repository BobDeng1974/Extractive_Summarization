’ flights of fancy : there 's almost too much leg room in first class 2			2
) check for breakages it ’s not unusual to be upgraded if your seat or seat belt is broken			1
obviously this is not a green light to start causing willful damage , but it 's worth checking			2
on packed flights there may be nowhere else to put you other than in the lap of the @entity73			2
this includes if entertainment system and whether your seat can fully recline says @entity35 3			2
) fly outside of commuter times regular business travellers tend to get preference over casual holiday - goers in the @entity81			1
they 've got the air miles , they know the airport staff and they look the part			0
to give yourself a fighting chance book flights that laptop @entity87 are less likely to be on			1

you might get a worse seat near the loo or you might strike @entity102 gold			0
at the very least you ’ll probably get a complimentary drink to drown your sorrows			0
sitting next to a crying baby gives you an airtight case for requesting a seat switch 5			0
) arrive early or late the early bird catches the worm			0
@entity111 's @entity110 has seen it pay to be prompt to check - in			1
‘ if passengers need to be moved between cabins for operational reasons , the airline will probably know this several hours before the flight			0

’ enjoy the benefits of travelling alone			0
you 're more likely to be upgraded 7			0
) dress for success while experts agree that looking like an investment banker or @entity141 film star does n’t help as much as it used to , tracksuits and torn jeans certainly wo n’t further your cause			1
airlines want first and business class to look a league above , so make sure you do too			0

' a queue of flights ready for takeoff at @entity161			0
where will you be sitting ? 8			0
) just ask it ’s an obvious point but asking politely at the check - in desk is often enough			1
@entity35 says : ‘ if you do n’t ask you do n’t get and with more people checking in online there are less people asking the question , ‘ is the flight full ? ’ if they ca n’t give you a free upgrade , they might give you a heavily reduced one			1

if you ’re on your honeymoon or it ’s a big anniversary it ’s worth a mention too , but only if it really is			0
check - in staff and air stewards are old hands at spotting fakers			1
remember to be polite and if it 's your birthday or a special occasion let the check - in attendant know 14			1
