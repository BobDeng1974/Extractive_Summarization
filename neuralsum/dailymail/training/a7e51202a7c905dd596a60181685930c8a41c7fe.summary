@entity1 's absence from @entity3 's squad for the @entity5 clash against @entity6 was because of a thigh strain			1
the @entity9 star was replaced by @entity10 at half - time as @entity13 's side drew 0 - 0 with @entity14 at @entity15 last sunday			1
@entity1 has emerged as @entity3 's first - choice right back under @entity16 and had started the previous 10 @entity18 games			1
@entity1 was taken off at half time during the @entity18 game against @entity14 last week the extent of @entity1 's thigh injury and the length of time he will be absent is not yet known @entity3 manager @entity13 has lost faith in @entity26 right back @entity10 the extent of the injury and the length of time @entity1 will be missing is not yet known , but @entity16 will hoping it is not serious as the @entity30 has lost faith in @entity26 right back @entity10 , who was left on the bench for the clash at the @entity34			1
it is a position that @entity3 are prioritising in the january transfer window			2
the injury will irk the former @entity38 manager further after the 63 - year - old has vented his frustration at the number of fixtures during the traditionally busy festive period			1
@entity3 manager @entity13 speaks during a press conference on tuesday ahead of the @entity5 clash @entity16 told @entity46 : ' you can not recover your body			2
that 's my opinion , but it 's also scientifically proven			1
i do n't think you have to do that to the players			0
' the @entity3 boss was echoing his complaints made on tuesday where he insisted the players ' safety was being jeopardised by the quick turnaround of fixtures			0
' everybody knows that a body can not recover within 48 hours			0
a frustrated @entity16 makes a point to the fourth official during the match at @entity15 on sunday ' therefore , there is a rule at @entity69 and @entity70 that you can not play the games so close			2
ok , that i have said			0
' that ’s scientifically proven , i have said that also			0
everybody knows that and in spite of that , we have to play			0
' it ’s the culture of @entity80			0
i do n’t mind but it is not good for the players , for the health of the players and what i say now is it is not good for the game because i think that the @entity88 , but also the fans , want attractive games			2
