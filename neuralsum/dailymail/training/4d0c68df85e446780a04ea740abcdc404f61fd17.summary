a new record has been set for the deepest fish ever seen in the world , at an incredible depth of 26,722 feet ( 8,145 metres )			1
the snailfish was found at the bottom of the @entity6 in the @entity7 , and breaks the previous record by almost 1,640 feet ( 500 metres )			1
the finding was part of an international expedition that also found many other new species at the extreme depths			0
it was spotted 26,722ft down in the @entity6 in the @entity7			1
called a snailfish it has a ghostly tadpole - like body and no scales			1
it is seen here swimming with crustaceans the bizarre creature found is thought to be a snailfish , a ' ghostly ' looking creature that has a tad - pole like body they have large heads , small eyes and no scales , and are normally slightly larger than a human hand in length			1
dr @entity38 , from @entity16 said : ' this really deep fish did not look like anything we had seen before , nor does it look like anything we know of			1
' it is unbelievably fragile , with large wing - like fins and a head resembling a cartoon dog '			0
scientists say that fish can not survive deeper than about 26,902ft ( 8,200 metres ) in the oceans			1
they said this was the limit at which their tissues could withstand the crushing pressures			0
they survive using a molecule called trimethylamine n - oxide ( @entity58 ) , which gives them their ‘ fishy ’ smell			2
going deeper would require some other mechanism to survive			0
scientists from @entity16 and @entity64 captured footage of fish in more than 105 hours of video taken at the @entity6			1
this was done with an @entity16 - built machine used to venture into deep waters , known as the @entity71			1
it is the @entity73 's deepest diving vehicle and is equipped with a high definition underwater camera			0
the 30 - day voyage was run by @entity78 's research vessel , @entity79			0
scientists carried out 92 dives across the entire depth range of the trench , which lies in the @entity7 east of the @entity84 and south of @entity86 , from 16,400 to 34,600ft ( 5,000 to 10,545m )			1
they were also surprised to have discovered a rare ' supergiant ' amphipod , a shrimp - like crustacean that can be up to 11 inches ( 28cm ) long and was originally discovered in @entity90 in 2012			0
this is seen swimming with the snailfish in some of the footage			0
the bizarre creature found ( shown ) is thought to be a snailfish , a ' ghostly ' looking creature that has a tadpole like body			1
they have large heads , small eyes and no scales , and are normally slightly larger than a human hand in length scientists captured footage of fish in more than 105 hours of video taken at the @entity6			1
this was done using an @entity16 - built machine used to venture into deep waters , known as the @entity71 ( shown )			2
it is the @entity73 's deepest diving vehicle and is equipped with a high definition underwater camera dr @entity38 added : ' knowing these creatures exist is one thing , but to watch them alive in their natural habitat and interacting with other species is truly amazing , we have learnt a great deal			0
' the @entity123 , published online , will give researchers new insights into the complicated ocean ecosystems by looking not only at the deepest point of the trench but also at different depths			2
' many studies have rushed to the bottom of the trench but from an ecological view that is very limiting , ' said dr @entity133 , co-chief scientist from @entity64			0
' it 's like trying to understand a mountain ecosystem by only looking at its summit '			0
scientists carried out 92 dives across the entire depth range of the trench , which lies in the @entity7 east of the @entity84 and and south of @entity86 , from 16,400 to 34,600ft ( 5,000 to 10,545m )			2
they observed many species at diffferent depths including a large cusk eel , @entity145 , seen here rat - tails , decapods , supergiants and snailfish are seen here at a depth of 23,005ft ( 7,012 metres )			2
dr @entity38 of @entity16 said : ' knowing these creatures exist is one thing , but to watch them alive in their natural habitat and interacting with other species is truly amazing , we have learnt a great deal ' @entity16 researchers , who have carried out 13 previous trips to the trench , say they have also set records by filming three other types of fish at previously unrecorded depths			1
they also successfully reached the bottom of the @entity166 , the trench 's deepest point at 34,600ft ( 10,545 metres ) , solidifying their deep - sea lander as the @entity171 deepest diving vehicle			2
dr @entity38 added : ' we are particularly proud of this vehicle given it was designed and almost entirely built in villages in @entity174 in the @entity175 of @entity176			0
' @entity177 , co-founder of the @entity78 in @entity178 , also involved in the expedition added : ' rarely , do we get a full perspective of the ocean 's unique deep environments			0
' the questions that the scientists will be able to answer following this cruise will pave the way for a better understanding of the deep sea , which is not exempt from human impact			0

@entity16 researchers set new record for deepest fish found
it was spotted 26,722ft down in the @entity6 in the @entity7
called a snailfish it has a ghostly tadpole - like body and no scales
it breaks the previous record by 1,640 feet ( 500 metres )
scientists do *n't* think fish can live much deeper because the pressure becomes too intense
