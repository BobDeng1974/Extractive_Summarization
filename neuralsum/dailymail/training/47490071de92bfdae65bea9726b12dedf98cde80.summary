when @entity2 's @entity1 and @entity4 's @entity3 were trying to put off those taking penalties during their @entity8 shoot - out , referee @entity0 was losing patience with the goalkeepers			1
@entity1 and @entity3 were warned by the official for their antics several times and told to return to their line to wait for the penalty to be taken			2
but , with @entity1 already cautioned , the 24 - year - old was on thin ice , especially when @entity0 approached him with a yellow card in his hand			1
' @entity41 and @entity8 rules state a goalkeeper can be sent off during a shoot - out , whether for a second yellow or straight red , and only a player that finished the match can replace him in goal			1
at @entity33 , @entity0 approached @entity1 to give him a telling off , holding a yellow card in his hand , though the referee could have been using it to pencil in those that scored and missed their spot - kicks			1
but the @entity56 was one wrong move away from being dismissed , and he would not have been the first in football either			2
the only other reported sending off for a goalkeeper during a penalty shoot - out came in a @entity62 quarter - final between @entity63 and @entity64 on may 25 , 2003			1
@entity63 goalkeeper @entity65 got a pat on the back by opposite number @entity68 , and reacted by ' punching him in the face '			2
@entity3 took his gloves off to take the winning penalty against @entity2 as @entity1 lost the shoot - out 9 - 8 @entity3 runs away in celebration after scoring the winning penalty for @entity4 against @entity2 @entity63 goalkeeper @entity65 was sent off for ' punching ' his opposite number ' in the face ' in 2003 ' i over-reacted in an exchange of words between myself and my counterpart , ' @entity65 said			1
' this unbecoming behaviour has not only embarrassed me , but also the organisation that i work for , the @entity84 ( @entity85 )			0
' i hope my apology would be recognised and i pledge my commitment in serving the nation			0
' putting off those taking penalties was taken to another level by @entity27 's @entity26 during the @entity29 , with @entity92 bringing the @entity94 goalkeeper on purely for the shoot - out			1
@entity26 screamed ' @entity96 ! ' in the face of @entity99 's every penalty taker in @entity100 during the quarter - final , but the @entity102 did not regret doing so as it earned @entity27 the win			2
‘ i do n’t think i did anything wrong			0
i did n’t shout in an aggressive manner , ' insisted @entity26			0
‘ i did everything in my power and i would be happy to do it again , absolutely no problem			0
' there are no regrets			0
i was ready for the moment			0
i told them i knew where they were going and i had analysed it			0
i tried to get in their heads and it worked			0
' @entity94 goalkeeper @entity26 used the tactic during the @entity29 for @entity27 against @entity99 the tactic to put off @entity99 's penalty takers worked , though the @entity27 goalkeeper was not booked @entity26 , pictured after saving his first penalty , screamed ' @entity96 ! ' in the face of @entity99 's every penalty taker			1
