unpacking their @entity3 delivery earlier this month , one family from @entity1 found a rather unwelcome addition to their order : a lethal spider			1
the @entity8 — the world ’s most venomous species of arachnid — was nestling in a bunch of bananas and sparked a terrifying game of hide - and - seek before it was eventually captured by a pest control expert			1
while autumn is a time when spiders traditionally come into homes as temperatures fall outside , at least in @entity20 we ’ve always been able to console ourselves with the fact they will be harmless			1
whereas in the past the animals would be killed off by chemicals used in the growing process , or cold temperatures , it is thought the trend for pesticide - free food — combined with unseasonably warm weather this summer and autumn — has been behind a recent acceleration in cases of @entity8 being found in our homes			1
@entity20 has already seen an increase in false widow spiders ( native species and those accidentally brought in with imported items ) , which also pack a painful bite , for the same reasons			1
worryingly , no statistics are kept ; the government ’s @entity55 ( @entity55 ) said this week that responsibility lay with the retailers bringing in the deadly creatures with their produce			2
yet sightings of the @entity8 — whose scientific name is @entity8 , @entity64 for ‘ murderess ’ — have exploded in recent years			1
in the past two months alone , there have been two incidents involving potentially lethal spiders			1
in both cases , egg sacs containing thousands of spiderlings were found			1
caught : the @entity8 , which arrived in a bunch of bananas that were part of a @entity3 delivery , sparked a terrifying game of hide - and - seek before it was eventually captured by a pest control expert families who suspect the species has invaded their home are encouraged to evacuate so it can be thoroughly fumigated			1
worse still , the large arachnids — which can have a 6in legspan and are also known as banana spiders because of their penchant for nesting among the fruit — are extraordinarily aggressive			1
@entity87 , the naturalist and television presenter , said this week : ‘ most spiders wo n’t jump out and attack you			1
they only tend to bite as a last resort , when they are cornered and threatened			2
but @entity94 @entity93 can be extremely aggressive and they will bite you repeatedly , injecting more venom every time			2
‘ for about 10 per cent of the population , particularly the very young , the elderly and those who suffer allergies , there is a genuine risk of death from the venom			2
’ @entity105 lists the @entity8 as the most toxic on earth			1
its venom is 30 times more powerful than that of a rattlesnake , leading humans to suffer an irregular heartbeat , high blood pressure , vomiting and eventual death			2
despite an antidote being developed in the @entity116 , there is currently no anti-venom stored in @entity20			2
in homes , the @entity8 will usually search for cover and dark places to lurk during daytime , favouring clothes , shoes , boxes and log piles			1
if disturbed , it rears up and attacks			2
this was the risk facing the family in @entity1 with their @entity3 delivery			1
as the father put it : ‘ although people might think these things are funny , the spider could have killed me or my son if he ’d gone to get a banana			1
’ fortunately for them , the spider was caught by a pest control expert sent by @entity3 and its sac of hundreds of spiderlings was placed in the freezer to kill them			1
not everyone is so lucky , however			0
@entity147 , 32 , was working as a chef in a @entity150 pub when , while wiping down a surface , he felt a pricking sensation in his hand			0
he dropped the cloth and a large spider fell out			0
when he tried to move it , the spider bit him again			0
thinking fast , he took a photograph of the arachnid with his mobile phone and a colleague drove @entity147 to hospital			0
but with no major symptoms showing , he was sent home			0
surge : @entity20 has already seen an increase in false widow spiders ( native species and those accidentally brought in with imported items ) , which also pack a painful bite			1
above , file image of a false widow spider ‘ within ten minutes of getting home i was practically paralysed down one side , my hand swelled up like a balloon , ’ he said			0
he promptly collapsed , with his heart beating so hard ‘ i thought it was going to come out of my chest ’			1
he was taken by ambulance to a different hospital where the image on his phone was sent to a specialist centre and identified as a @entity8			1
@entity147 was put on a saline drip to clear the poison out of his system and gradually recovered			0
had he been a young child , he might not have been so lucky			0
with the long list of incidents which have unfolded since his experience in 2005 , many pest control experts believe it is only a matter of time before there is a tragedy			1
poisoned : @entity147 , 32 , was working as a chef in a @entity150 pub when he was bitten by a @entity8 in 2005 last month @entity198 , 30 , of @entity199 , was told to incinerate her vacuum cleaner after using it to collect hundreds of @entity94 wandering spiders which had fallen off a bunch of bananas			1
in march , @entity208 , his wife and two young children were ordered to evacuate their @entity210 home for the same reason , until it had been fumigated			0
@entity212 , 29 , bought some @entity215 @entity214 bananas at @entity216 ’s in @entity217 , @entity1 , and had eaten about half when she spotted a white nest at the bottom of the fruit			1
as she bit into a banana the tiny black dots she assumed were bruises fell to the floor and scuttled away			0
pest control experts identified @entity94 wandering spiders and the house was evacuated			2
supermarket staff are also in danger			0
some co-op and @entity232 stores have had to close temporarily after these spiders were spotted			2
@entity232 warehouse worker @entity234 , from @entity235 , spent almost a month in a coma after a suspected spider bite last year			2
he came home from work complaining of groin pains and discovered a rash			0
soon his fingers swelled up ‘ like sausages ’ and he was taken to hospital , where he suffered kidney and liver failure			0
yesterday , he told the @entity247 : ‘ there has been no definitive answer to what caused it , but a spider bite is one of the most likely			0
‘ i did n’t handle any fresh produce in that warehouse but there were containers from @entity257			0
i do n’t blame anyone for what happened			0
but this is a global market now and these things can happen			0
’ a spokesman for @entity55 said responsibility for dealing with imported venomous spiders lay with regional councils : ‘ it should be reported to the local authority , who would get an environmental health officer to look at it , as this is related to food safety			1
’ but @entity269 , chief executive of invertebrate protection charity @entity270 , says : ‘ people do n’t need to worry about finding spider eggs on bananas			2
the spiderlings would have to be an awful lot bigger to pose any threat			0
‘ in their native environment , hardly any survive to adulthood ; in @entity20 they ’ve got no chance			0
it ’s too dry for them to survive indoors and too cold outdoors			0
‘ frankly there is no need for homes to be fumigated			0
that only happens because of the corporate need for supermarkets to be seen as taking action			0
’ there is also a trend for keeping spiders as pets , one of the most popular in this country being the @entity8 , part of the @entity94 wandering family			1
‘ that ’s the most likely environment in which we ’ll see someone bitten by one of these spiders , ’ concedes mr @entity269			2
whether this reassures arachnophobes is another matter .			0

the @entity8 was found nestled in bunch of bananas
fruit was part @entity1 family **'s** @entity3 delivery earlier this month
in the past animals would be killed off by chemicals used in growing process
it **'s** thought pesticide - free food trend has been behind foreign spiders surge
two incidents involving potentially lethal spiders in past two months alone
