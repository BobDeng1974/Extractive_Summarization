the blow that killed @entity1 in battle was so powerful that it went up through the base of his brain and left an indentation on the inside of his skull , scientists studying his remains have revealed			1
footage that shows the moment when scientists discovered the extent of the injuries suffered by the @entity18 king - who was the last @entity19 king to die in battle - has been released			1
in the video , professor @entity21 , a forensic pathologist at @entity22 , is shown discovering two wounds at the base of the skull			1
the genetic analysis showed that @entity1 almost certainly had blue eyes and likely had blonde hair - although it may have darkened with age			0
@entity1 was depicted by @entity43 as a tyrannical hunchback who murdered two princes in the @entity47			0
but scans of the king 's skeleton show he was n't a hunchback , but only had a slight deformity that would have barely affected his appearance or prowess on the field of battle			2
the notorious description by @entity43 of a ‘ hunchback toad ’ , a machiavellian villain suffering a twisted body , a limp and withered arm , was almost certainly an attempt to blacken his reputation , experts claim			0
instead , a 3d reconstruction of the king ’s spine shows 65 to 85 degrees of ‘ scoliosis ’ , or sideways bending of his spine to the right			0
the condition , which would have developed in his early teens , means he was very far from being a hunchback			0
despite having one shoulder slightly higher than the other and a short trunk in comparison with his arms and legs , there is no evidence he walked with a limp			0
the findings suggest that a weapon such as a sword or a spike had been thrust upwards through the base of the king 's neck so hard that it had gone straight through his brain to the other side of his skull			1
it comes two months after genetic analysis of the battle scarred skeleton , discovered under a council car park in @entity104 three years ago , did belong to @entity1 scientists studying the remains believe the king was surrounded by a mob of enemy soldiers and hacked to death after he had lost his helmet			1
using modern medical scanners , they established that the @entity19 monarch suffered 11 devastating injuries at the @entity115 in 1485			0
dr @entity116 , who led the exhumation of the skeleton from the @entity120 car park , said : ' following the identification of a major sharp force trauma to the base of the skull , which was probably inflicted by a sword or the top spike of a bill or halberd , we were interested to determine the angle of the blow			1
“ professor @entity21 noted a small traumatic lesion on the interior surface of the cranium , directly opposite the sharp force trauma			0
' careful examination showed that the two injuries lined up with one another , and also with an injury to @entity1 ’s first cervical vertebra			2
' the combination of all three injuries provided evidence for the direction of the injury and also the depth to which the weapon had penetrated the skull			1
' scientists found injuries in the skull of @entity1 lined up ( above ) to reveal the blow that killed him in battle @entity1 's skeleton found under a car park in @entity104 was found to have 11 injuries sustained in battle according to findings published earlier by the scientists in the @entity164 medical journal , the lethal blows came from one of two devastating swipes to the back of the head			1
one was delivered by a halberd - a vicious axe - like weapon used in the late medieval period - and the other by a sword			2
the researchers found that the skeleton had two additional injuries , which they think may have been inflicted after his enemies tore his armour from his lifeless body			2
one injury - to the buttocks - probably came as his bloodied body was paraded around the battle ground , the researchers suggest			0
the medical evidence establishes the most detailed account of @entity1 ’s death ever attempted			0
the scientists used modern forensic methods to examine the injuries inflicted on @entity1 's skeleton professor @entity21 , who led the examination of the remains and has worked as a @entity195 pathologist for 19 years , described seeing the injuries in the skull lined up as a ' eureka moment '			1
he said : ' i was able to look at the large injury in the base of the skull and , through experience , i was able to identify the key injury			2
' professor @entity205 , a materials engineer at @entity22 also involved in the study , added : ' using modern forensic examination , we have discovered that @entity1 's skeleton sustained 11 wounds at or near the time of his death - nine of them to the skull , which were clearly inflicted in battle			1
' the injuries to the head suggest he had either removed or lost his helmet			2
the other two injuries that we found were to a rib and his pelvis			0

pathologists at @entity22 found injuries on the base of the skull and inside the cranium lined up , suggesting the same weapon made them
they think the lethal blow was caused by a sword or spike thrust upwards
the moment of the discovery was videoed as the skeleton was examined
scientists believe the king was hacked to death after losing his helmet
