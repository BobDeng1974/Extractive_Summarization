by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 12:59 est , 15 january 2014 updated : 10:52 est , 17 january 2014 as the @entity5 ’s political editor , he is supposed to bring gravitas and heavyweight analysis to the @entity9 ’s coverage of prime minister ’s questions			1
but @entity13 ’s most memorable contribution to today ’s programme was his @entity15 suddenly blaring out a @entity17 song			0
as his co-presenters and mps appeared by baffled by the interruption , he scrambled to turn it off before lyrics to ‘ @entity24 ’ could be heard on air			0
as miss @entity27 insisted that high fliers in the @entity47 are already well - paid , viewers were treated to the opening lyrics of @entity24 : ‘ are you gon na take me home tonight ? oh , down beside that red firelight ; are you gon na let it all hang out ? ’ host @entity52 picked up his tablet computer , asking mr @entity13 : ‘ is that you … is that me … oh it ’s you			2
’ miss @entity55 was trying to criticise @entity57 justice minister @entity41 about the need to cap bonus when she was distracted by @entity60 as the debate continued , mr @entity13 lent in to ask if anyone knew the next line of the song as miss @entity55 looked on – distinctly unimpressed – mr @entity13 quickly opened his @entity15 mini , and told viewers : ‘ i am going to turn it off before the really embarrassing lyrics start			1
’ he succeeded in pressing pause before @entity60 and co. belted out : ‘ @entity71 bottomed girls , you make the rockin ' world go round			0
’ mr @entity13 seemed to see the funny side to the gaffe , asking the @entity78 if they knew what the next line to the song was			0
but miss @entity55 was determined to get back onto bankers bonuses , claiming ‘ this is a conspiracy ’ against her scoring political points .			1

coverage of @entity87 was followed by debate on bankers ' bonuses
@entity28 's @entity27 *clashed* with justice minister @entity41
but political point scoring was *upstaged* by @entity94
