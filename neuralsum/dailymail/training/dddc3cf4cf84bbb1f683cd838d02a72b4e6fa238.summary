by @entity0 was the turbulent reign of @entity2 at @entity3 necessarily his fault ? one researcher says he might have been doomed from the outset , owing to how sir @entity7 ‘ over-achieved ’ at the club			1
but ultimately even science may not redeem him – the final straw was likely more to do with ‘ politics than the performance of the club ’			0
science behind the sacking ? research suggests @entity2 is the 10th greatest manager in the last 40 years of @entity17 football , so why did n't he survive at @entity3 ? the information is based on research by dr. @entity20 , a professor of @entity21 in the @entity22 at the @entity23			1
for the last three decades he has been measuring the performance of managers against the wage spending of their club			0
( points according to dr. @entity20 's data ) 1			1
sir @entity7 - 549.9 2			1
@entity50 64.9 what he has found is that some can be regarded as underachievers – but more often than not managers overachieve			1
the number of points a manager gets from a game from the data depends on the relative quality of the team and the opponent			0
if the team ’s wages are twice as high as the opponents then in a sense they are twice as good			0
if the points actually won are greater than this expectation than they are attributed to the manager , which is how points are accumulated			0
@entity3 , for example , won a lot under @entity7 simply because they had better players , says dr. @entity20			1
but they won even more than predicted , so the extra points are credited to @entity7			2
this gives @entity7 a total score 549.9 , putting him top of the pile			2
in second is @entity32 with 398.9 points			2
for managers that have underachieved , they find themselves with minus points			0
@entity90 , manager of @entity91 from 1974 to 1977 , comes in last with a score of -37.4 thanks to a rather dismal win percentage of 25 per cent with the club			0
@entity50 , meanwhile , comes in at 117th , owing to him having a ' boatload of money ' but not necessarily overachieving in his first stint at @entity98			1
the points so far , however , are based on provisional data and may still be revised			0
perhaps unsurprisingly sir @entity7 tops the list , and it may be this ' over-achievement ' that meant even a manager with the previous stature of @entity2 was not able to fill his boots ‘ basically my research has generally focused on the relation between team wage spending and performance , ’ dr. @entity20 tells @entity107			1
‘ a lot of my research has a strong correlation between wage spending and performance			0
‘ we also looked at things like nationality , whether they were a player or not , where they played and so on			0
‘ over time 90 % of variation in league position can be accounted for by the wage spending of the club			0
‘ @entity7 ’s obviously a great manager , but he did have a lot of money so you need to take out the impact the money effect had			2
‘ that ’s what this methodology allows you to do			0
' @entity7 was the biggest over-achiever over the period that he was manager			2
' you could have predicted he would be successful with money , maybe top five in the league			0
' however they did n't come in the top five every season , they won it more often than not			0
' you can take the difference between what an average manager would achieve with the money and the actual achievement with @entity7 , the " @entity7 difference " if you like			2
' and it is possibly this ' fergie difference ' that ultimately led to the sacking of @entity2			1
to compile the data , dr. @entity20 studied every manager in all four divisions of @entity17 football from 1974 to 2010			1
to qualify for the data a manager had to have been in charge for more than 30 games , which left a total of 528 managers			1
while @entity7 tops the list , perhaps as expected , it is the positions of others that are of most interest			1
@entity2 , for example , comes in at 10th place thanks to his ‘ success ’ during his time at @entity176			1
this was due to him overachieving with only limited amounts of money available			0
however , with his move to @entity3 dr. @entity20 says he perhaps should have been a success at the club			1
in the list @entity50 came in at a lowly 117th after his first spell at @entity98			1
according to dr. @entity20 this is due to him failing to over-achieve with ' boatloads of money ' ‘ managers that are successful in the data tend to be at on average several clubs , ’ he says			1
‘ is @entity2 an outlier ? it ’s a matter of too few observations			2
’ ‘ i do n’t think the number of games he was in charge at @entity3 is a good basis to judge his abilities as a manager			2
‘ i wonder if his sacking is not really more to do with politics than the performance of the club			0
’ he also points out that it may be difficult to update @entity2 ’ record as his stint at @entity3 was so brief			1
‘ we ’re talking about tracking managers over tens of thousands of games over a 40 - year period , ’ he explains			2
‘ so one manager being fired on one day is not a very big event in our database			0
‘ what we ’re trying to do is look what is generally true			0
‘ @entity2 is a good manager and i think everybody acknowledges that			2
‘ he had tremendous success with @entity176 – my take is he was n’t given a chance at @entity3			1
‘ surely he would need two or three years in the job to begin to assess if he could have done a job at the club in the long term			0
‘ @entity7 went three years without winning anything			1
‘ what happened in the last year tells us nothing			0

new research has tracked the success of managers over the last 40 years
it compiles data for 528 managers across @entity17 football 's four divisions
dr. @entity20 compared wages of clubs with their performances on pitch
this data was used to work out who were statistically the best managers
sir @entity7 topped the list *ahead* of @entity32
but thanks to his time at @entity176 , @entity2 came in at tenth
@entity50 , meanwhile , came in at a lowly 117th out of 528
the data suggests @entity2 should perhaps have been a success at @entity3
but @entity7 's ' over-achievements ' ultimately left him with too big a task
