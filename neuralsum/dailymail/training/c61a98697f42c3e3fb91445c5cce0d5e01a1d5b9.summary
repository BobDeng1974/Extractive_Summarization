by @entity0 published : 06:47 est , 29 august 2012 updated : 07:48 est , 29 august 2012 @entity1 used to be a classroom assistant and was too ashamed to admit he wanted to be a pe teacher @entity1 always dreamed of being a pe teacher			1
but , weighing 22 stone , the classroom assistant at @entity6 in @entity7 was too embarrassed to tell anyone			1
and , being too fat to run , the only exercise the @entity12 boy ever did was walking to his local takeaway shop to collect food			1
now 24 , @entity1 has spent the last year sticking to a regimental diet and exercise plan that he formulated himself			1
and in just 12 months he has shifted an enormous 10 stone , winning his dream job as a sports teacher			1
he said : ' it 's what i have always wanted to do , but i never had the confidence because i was too fat			2
' how could i seriously apply to be a pe teacher when i could n't even run without getting out of breath ? ' the kids would have laughed at me			2
it was hardly setting the right example			2
' the only real exercise i did was walking to my local takeaway			2
' @entity1 last year , before he lost 10 stone and won his dream job as a pe teacher @entity1 's former diet consisted of a constant supply of hot buttered toast , crisps and cakes until a big school lunch			1
he then continuously ate crisps and biscuits until picking up a takeaway after school and then having a late evening meal			0
he finally decided to do something about his weight when he realised he could n't find any trendy clothes in his xxxl giant size			0
he says : ' i had to dress like an old man while my mates wore fashionable stuff because nothing in @entity55 fitted me			2
i needed a 44 inch waist			0
they do n't make skinny jeans that big			0
' @entity1 ( pictured before his weight loss ) gave up alcohol when he realised how many calories he was consuming through beer alone @entity1 downloaded a calorie counter on his @entity64 , restricted himself to 1,500 calories a day and stuck to a healthy diet of cereal for breakfast , salad for lunch and grilled meat and vegetables for dinner			1
he said : ' at first i found the feeling of hunger odd			0
i had never experienced it before because i was always eating			0
he also ditched alcohol when the calorie counter revealed how many calories he consumed through drinking and how if he stopped buying beer he 'd be able to eat more			1
ryan on holiday after his dramatic weight loss @entity1 lost a stone in the first fortnight and started running to speed up the weight loss			1
' at first i could only do a few minutes before getting out of breath but the more weight i lost the easier it was and i really started enjoying it			0
' soon he was losing a stone a month			2
' the kids at school started noticing and knowing i was inspiring them kept me going			0
' i was desperate to became a pe teacher but did n't want to do anything about it until i reached my goal weight			0
' @entity1 went from super fat to super fit in just one year in may last year @entity1 reached 12 stone and ran his first half marathon			1
a few months later he spoke to his head teacher and was promoted to @entity105 teaching assistant			0
@entity1 with his new girlfriend @entity106 ' i was ecstatic			1
it made all the hard work worth it			0
when i helped take a lesson for the first time it was an amazing moment			0
@entity1 is now about to start his formal @entity105 teaching qualification and has since found love with fellow teacher @entity106			1
' i practice what i preach to the pupils and they know that			0
i hope they are as proud of me as i am of them			0
' i 'm really proud of what i have achieved and feel privileged to be able to help students achieve the same			2
' because i worked at the same school as a classroom assistant when i was fat all the kids have known me big and now			2
' i love it when they tell me " well done , sir , " and ask me how i did it			0
' they can see for themselves the huge difference healthy eating and exercise has made to my life and i tell them it can do the same for them too			1
' write caption here @entity1 now counts running and weightlifting as his favourite hobbies @entity1 is now a sports fanatic and teaches @entity105 in his school in @entity12			1

@entity12 man @entity1 , 24 , weighed 22 stone and was too fat to run
he devised his own diet and exercise plan and stopped drinking alcohol
*swapped* hot buttered toast for grilled vegetables
hopes his story will inspire his students to be healthy
