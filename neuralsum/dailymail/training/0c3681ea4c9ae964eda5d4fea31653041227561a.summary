by @entity0 alarmed by booming sales of highly potent edible marijuana products , @entity2 regulators have drafted an emergency rule making it easier for new users to tell how much pot they 're eating			1
the result ? weaker pot brownies and cookies on store shelves , and new packaging requirements			0
draft emergency rules require @entity2 's makers of edible pot to physically de-mark their products so that consumers can ' intuitively determine ' how much constitutes a dose of marijuana 's intoxicating ingredient , @entity22			1
but many consumers have complained they ca n't tell what a serving is and eat too much of a heavily - dosed product , leading to many reports of unpleasant experiences , including nausea and feelings of paralysis			1
those stronger - dosed edibles are holdovers from the medical pot marketplace , where sellers say consumers who have built up strong tolerances wo n't buy anything that has a dosage less than 100 milligrams of @entity22			1
@entity57 columnist @entity56 wrote in june of going into a ' hallucinatory state after eating too much pot candy in @entity2 @entity57 columnist @entity56 wrote in june of going into a ' hallucinatory state ' after visiting @entity2 and eating too much pot candy			0
and an edible pot cookie has been blamed for the death earlier this year of a college student who ate more than six times the suggested dose and then fell to his death from a hotel balcony			0
a spokeswoman for the @entity2 agency that prepared the rules could n't comment on them because they have not been made public			2
but @entity72 of the state @entity73 confirmed that the rules take effect in november if approved by the governor , as expected			1
the final rule could differ from the draft obtained by @entity0 on thursday			0
marijuana industry advocates who helped draft the rules said they 'll help consumers			1
' the problem of people overdoing it with edibles , accidentally , is going to be very much taken care of with these new rules , ' said @entity89 of the @entity90 , which represents several large @entity32 dispensaries			2
the draft rules also set new packaging requirements for products that ca n't easily be divided or perforated - such as liquids or granolas			1
gone is the requirement that pot - infused juices and sodas come in opaque packaging			0
instead , the liquids would have to be sold in transparent bottles surrounded by opaque packaging			0
the bottles would need to allow consumers to tell how much they 've drunk , so they could look like cough - syrup bottles , with dividing lines on the side			2
solids that ca n't be easily de-marked , such as granola , could not exceed 10 mg of active thc per package			0
so instead of a big bag , they 'd have to be divided into single - serve packages			0
a pot - infused cookie maker who has seen the emergency rules said they 'll lead to milder products on shelves			1
@entity120 : these drug - infused candies are sold at @entity123 marijuana store in @entity124 , @entity2 @entity125 of @entity126 said she 's planning to stop making cookies stronger than 10 mg of @entity22 per piece , at least for the recreational market			2
' that 's the way the industry will be going , where each piece is 10 ( mg of @entity22 ) and not something you 'll have to measure yourself , ' she said			2
the @entity73 starts work on friday on a bigger proposal - requiring edible pot products to be colored or stamped to indicate they contain pot. lawmakers have expressed alarm that marijuana treats look just like their straight - laced counterparts when out of the package			0
but it 's not clear how to give edible pot products a distinct appearance while still looking like something people would eat			0
taking action : @entity2 regulators have drafted an emergency rule making it easier for new users to tell how much pot they 're eating , including when devouring hash cookies ( pictured ) var p = new anv_pl_def ( ) ; p.config = { } ; p.config.width = 640 ; p.config.height = 360 ; @entity157 ( ' @entity158 1000011 @entity159 ' ) ;			1
