@entity1 supermodel and @entity2 has swapped lacy lingerie for a black and fuchsia shift dress , modelling the new uniform for @entity1 airline @entity7			1
but the flight attendants expected to wear the new attire while working on flights have complained that it is too sexy , impractically tight , and unflattering on anyone who does n't have the enviably slim curves of @entity15 's ex-wife			1
speaking about the @entity17 - designed uniforms - which @entity7 ambassador @entity18 , 30 , first modelled in april - one domestic short - haul flight attendant told @entity1 's @entity20 : ' the uniforms are really tight and they are simply not practical for the very physical job we have to do			1
one stewardess added : ' the uniform looks fantastic on @entity2 but unfortunately we do n't all look like her , " said another attendant			2
' @entity35 range in age from their 20s to their 60s and a lot of the older ones do n't want to wear tight - fitting uniforms , ' she continued			2
' we like the current @entity43 - designed uniforms			1
' over 12,000 @entity7 employees will wear the new uniform from thursday , despite the airline having recently announced plans to cut 1000 jobs in a bit to save aus $ 2bn over then next three years			1
a spokeswoman for the @entity52 said union members had been in touch with concerns about the new dresses			0
speaking to the @entity20 , she said : ' we have asked the airline to tweak the uniform a little to accommodate some concerns			0
' once it comes in and the crew are wearing it we will be having more discussions			0
if there are more issues , obviously we would expect the company to iron them out			0
' but a @entity7 spokeswoman said several crew members had been on a panel which gave input into the design , and that the new clothes had been trialled by 75 members of staff who wore int on the job for several weeks			2
she said : ' the feedback we 've had from staff on the new uniform has been overwhelmingly positive			0
' there are bound to be some adjustments needed as we roll out multiple pieces to 12,000 people , but it 's been going very smoothly and there 's a lot of excitement			0
