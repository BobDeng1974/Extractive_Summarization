after having leveled huge swathes of @entity3 and the @entity4 as it rampaged through the region on monday night , superstorm @entity0 inflicted a final indignity as it caused coffins to rise from their graves			1
at one cemetery in @entity12 , @entity13 , two caskets , one silver and the other bronze , rose up from the ground as the sheer force of the water unleashed by @entity0 swelled the ground			1
powerful enough to dislodge the cement slabs that covered the graves , the sad sight indicated the indiscriminate bombardment that mother nature brought to reign over the @entity28 @entity27 coastline			1
superstorm @entity0 killed at least 50 people , many hit by falling trees , and still was n't finished			1
it inched inland across @entity48 , ready to bank toward western @entity3 to dump more of its water and likely cause more havoc last night			1
behind it : a dazed , inundated @entity3 , a waterlogged @entity27 and a moonscape of disarray and debris - from unmoored shore - town boardwalks to submerged mass - transit systems to delicate presidential politics			1
' nature , ' said @entity3 mayor @entity60 , assessing the damage to his city , ' is an awful lot more powerful than we are			1
' more than 8.2million households were without power in 17 states as far west as @entity68			2
nearly two million of those were in @entity3 , where large swaths of lower @entity71 lost electricity and entire streets ended up underwater - as did seven subway tunnels between @entity71 and @entity75 at one point			2
the @entity77 was closed for a second day from weather , the first time that has happened since a blizzard in 1888			2
huge operation : a @entity83 truck evacuates @entity12 residents from their flooded homes yesterday nature 's revenge : police and the @entity83 work together as they assist another @entity0 refugee the shutdown of mass transit crippled a city where more than 8.3million bus , subway and local rail trips are taken each day , and 800,000 vehicles cross bridges run by the transit agency			1
images from around the storm - affected areas depicted scenes reminiscent of big - budget disaster movies			2
in @entity105 , @entity106 , a gaping hole remained where once a stretch of boardwalk sat by the sea			2
in @entity111 , @entity3 , rubble from a fire that destroyed as many as 100 houses in an evacuated beachfront neighborhood jutted into the air at ugly angles against a gray sky			0
in heavily flooded @entity120 , @entity106 , across the @entity121 from @entity71 , dozens of yellow cabs sat parked in rows , submerged in murky water to their windshields			1
at the ground zero construction site in lower @entity71 , seawater rushed into a gaping hole under harsh floodlights			1
one of the most dramatic tales came from lower @entity71 , where a failed backup generator forced @entity132 's @entity131 to relocate more than 200 patients , including 20 babies from neonatal intensive care			0
dozens of ambulances lined up in the rainy night and the tiny patients were gingerly moved out , some attached to battery - powered respirators as gusts of wind blew their blankets			0
airports were shut across the @entity4 and far beyond as tens of thousands of travelers found they could n't get where they were going			0
@entity148 in @entity3 and @entity149 in @entity106 will reopen at 7am this morning with limited service , but @entity151 will stay closed , officials said			0
@entity0 began in the @entity27 and knocked around the @entity153 - killing nearly 70 people - and strengthened into a hurricane as it chugged across the southeastern coast of the @entity28			0
by last night it had ebbed in strength but was joining up with another , more wintry storm - an expected confluence of weather systems that earned it nicknames like ' superstorm ' and , on @entity166 eve , ' @entity0 '			0
@entity105 's fabled @entity167 , the first in the nation , lost several blocks when @entity0 came through , though the majority of it remained intact even as other @entity174 boardwalks were dismantled			0
what damage could be seen on the coastline tuesday was , in some locations , staggering - ' unthinkable , ' @entity106 gov. @entity175 said of what unfolded along the @entity174 , where houses were swept from their foundations and amusement park rides were washed into the ocean			0
' beyond anything i thought i would ever see			0
' video : residents and business owners clean up after storm in @entity190			0

sheer force of flood water swelled *burial* ground in @entity12 , @entity13
two caskets , one silver and the other bronze , rose up from the ground
