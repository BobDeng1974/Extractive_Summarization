in 1928 motoring pioneer @entity0 said : ' mark my word			0
a combination airplane and motor car is coming			2
' now an incredible flying car that will allow drivers skip traffic jams and take to the skies has been unveiled			2
the vehicle can be driven on normal roads as well as being flown as a two - seater airplane , as it is able take off and land at any airport , ' opening the door to real door - to - door travel , ' according to the @entity20 company behind it			1
named the @entity23 hybrid invention was unveiled at a technology conference in @entity25			2
video of the car in flight below ... @entity29 : the @entity30 has a top speed of 124mph when it is airborne and can accommodate two passengers the company claims the vehicle can be parked in a standard parking space and can be driven on normal roads the vehicle has a maximum speed of 100mph when driven as a car , but in airplane mode can soar through the skies at 124mph			1
the prototype is part of an ongoing project by the @entity45 led by co-founders @entity47 and @entity48 , who are based in @entity49 , in @entity50			1
@entity51 : the vehicle can be driven on normal roads as well as being flown as a two - seater airplane , as it is able take off and land at any airport , ' opening the door to real door - to - door travel ' according to the @entity20 company @entity60 , @entity23 spokesman said : ' we have been developing the concept of a flying car since 1990			1
' our first model looked quite bizarre and it would have problems in the regular use			0
' that was a signal to improve the concept of the flying car in a way to become an integral part of the regular road traffic			0
' we got a positive feedback from several experts in avionics , which appreciated design and the technical solution of the process of transformation			0
the vehicle , which weighs 450kg , has a take - off speed of 90mph and a range of 430 miles as an airplane the flying car is powered by a large propeller at its rear			1
the company has been working on the concept to try and develop a vehicle that could become an ' integral part ' of the regular ways that people travel top speed : 124mph as a plane and 100mph as a car take - off speed : 90mph engine : @entity99 912 wings : @entity101 construction : steel framework and carbon coating dimensions : the car measures 6m long , 1.6m wide as a car and 8.2m wide as a plane weight : 450kg capacity : 2kg ' the car is constructed to be fuelled at regular gas stations using the fuel for @entity99 @entity115 engine			1
' the company claims the vehicle can be parked in a standard parking space and can be driven on normal roads			1
when used as a car , the vehicle has a range of 540 miles and measures just over two metres wide			2
built from light - weight steel framework and carbon coating , when converted into a plane , the vehicle measures just over eight metres wide and six metres long to accommodate two people			0
the increase in width is due to the unfurling of its collapsible wings			0

the @entity30 has a maximum speed of 100mph when driven as a car but in airplane mode can soar through the skies at 124mph
the hybrid vehicle is the *brainchild* of designers @entity47 and @entity48 based in @entity49 , in the @entity150
the vehicle can be driven on normal roads and fit into a standard parking space when its wings are *tucked* in , according to the designers
