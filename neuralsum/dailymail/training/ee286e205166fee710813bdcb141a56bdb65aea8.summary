by @entity0 last updated at 2:54 pm on 29th february 2012 its accents and vocabulary are as different as its vast and varied landscapes			0
and the diversity of dialects in the @entity8 are showcased in all their glory in the @entity11 ( @entity11 )			1
fifty years after its inception , the fifth and final volume of the @entity11 dictionary has been published , covering words beginning with @entity16 to @entity17 talking my language : the @entity11 dictionaries highlights the linguistic quirks that can be found in every nook and cranny of the @entity8 so now , words such as ' zydeco ' join other bizarre terms such as ' upscuddle ' , ' pinkletink ' and ' goozlum ' in the completed volumes			1
highlighting the linguistic quirks that can be found in every nook and cranny of the @entity8 , the @entity11 dictionary is a record of @entity31 as it is spoken by its residents - from its beginning up until the present			1
unlike other dictionaries , it does not record the standard language used throughout the country			0
it instead documents regional and folk speak ; words , phrases and pronunciations which vary from one part of the country to the other			1
and has proved to be an indispensable tool for many : teachers , librarians , researchers , historians , playwrights , journalists physicians are all said to be faithful users of it			0
@entity56 , the @entity57 's editor at large , told the @entity58 : ' it ’s a great and extremely comprehensive project that really shows more than we ’ve ever known before about @entity31 dialect			0
i use it every day			0
' sick to their stomachs in the @entity66 ( pictured ) : @entity67 who say they are feest mean they are disgusted or nauseated by something word jumble : ' @entity71 ' is the word for young frog and originates from @entity74 in @entity75 ( pictured ) the project began in 1962 when @entity77 , a professor of @entity31 at the @entity78 was appointed editor of the first dictionary - the first to highlight the diversity of the @entity31 language			2
between 1965 and 1970 , a team of more than 80 researchers travelled to 1,002 communities all over @entity8 to conduct face - to - face interviews with 2,777 people to gauge the depth and diversity of the spoken word			0
the results of those interviews formed the basis of the first dictionary			2
the dictionary was due to be published as one whole works by @entity96			1
however - after earnest editing - it became clear by 1980 that publishing @entity11 as a single unit would be impossible			1
it was then decided to publish each volume as and when it was ready , following the tradition of other historical dictionaries			2
@entity105 ( @entity107 mountains ) : a noisy quarrel @entity109 ( @entity67 ) : disgusted with / nauseated by @entity71 ( @entity74 , @entity75 ) : a young frog @entity111 ( @entity112 ) : a junk room / closet @entity115 ( @entity116 ) : to fool around , idle , waste time @entity118 ( @entity120 / @entity119 ) : dust or lint that collects in pockets @entity124 ( @entity125 ) : a viscous food such as sauce , gravy or pudding @entity130 ( @entity67 , @entity75 ) : an outing with no definite destination on the fritz ( @entity134 ) : out of order , a state of disrepair or ruin @entity138 ( @entity139 ) : unkempt , dishevelled @entity140 ( @entity141 ) : dance music in @entity144 culture			0
