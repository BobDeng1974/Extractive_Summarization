' i got shaved today , i was given an electric razor so i 'm feeling pretty good today , ' @entity10 said from behind the caged windows of the @entity15 factory			1
' i decided i 'm going to stick with the blue shirt all the way through , sort of like my little slogan thing			2
mr @entity10 , a co-owner of @entity38 , @entity39 - based @entity40 , said local officials had visited the 10 - year - old plant on the capital 's outskirts and coerced him into signing agreements saturday to meet the workers ' demands even though he sought to make clear that the remaining 100 workers were n't being laid off			1
he told @entity49 that he has tried to leave the plant but it his escape attempts have not worked			2
he said that the conditions of his captivity have been reasonable , with @entity54 and @entity55 getting delivered to him for breakfast and @entity15 food with rice for lunch			2
the local police authorities have been alerted and are on site , but he said that is more to insure that he receives sufficient food and they have little interest in ending the dispute			2
missed : @entity10 ' wife said that they have spoken every day since he has been in captivity but that is not enough ' they 're hands off here - they let the workers handle it themselves , ' he said of the local authorities			1

his wife told @entity81 that while they have been in contact , that is not enough for their family			0
' i just want him home , his kids want him home			0
every day we do get to talk to him but it 's very upsetting , ' she said			0

it is not rare in @entity15 for managers to be held by workers demanding back pay or other benefits , often from their @entity15 owners , though occasionally also involving foreign bosses			1

' i am not sure about the details of the solution , but i can guarantee the personal safety of the manager			0
' representatives from the @entity1 @entity171 stood outside the gate much of the day , and eventually were let in			0
@entity1 @entity171 spokesman @entity190 said the two sides were on the verge of an agreement and that @entity22 would have access to his attorneys			0

he arrived in @entity5 last tuesday to lay off the last 30 people			1
some had been working there for up to nine years , so their compensation packages were ' pretty nice , ' he said			2
some of the workers in the other divisions got wind of this , and , coupled with rumors that the whole plant was moving to @entity202 , started demanding similar severance packages on friday			1
@entity214 , president of the @entity215 in @entity15 , said he was n't familiar with @entity10 ' case , but that such hostage - taking was ' not a major problem ' for the foreign business community			1
