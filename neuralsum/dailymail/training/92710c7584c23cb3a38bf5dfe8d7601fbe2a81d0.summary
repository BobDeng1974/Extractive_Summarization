car manufacturers may be working on eco-friendly cars using hydrogen fuel cells and ‘ green ’ electricity			0
but three amateur inventors have come up with a steam - powered bike that uses sustainable wood chips for fuel			1
the @entity9 trio are testing their bike on local moorland and hope their biogas engine could one day be used to power homes and other machines in a more eco-friendly way than diesel			1
@entity23 , @entity24 and @entity25 are pictured from left to right the machine is endorsed by celebrity chef @entity27 and is a cross between a bicycle and trike			1
it works by woodchips being burnt inside the contraption ’s biomass engine , which gives off gas that is condensed into steam			2
rather than pedalling , the rider uses their feet to pump air into the ‘ expansion motor ’ to generate one horsepower – making the machine three times more powerful than the average cyclist			1
inventor craftsman @entity24 designed and built the bike with his friends @entity48 , a gallery curator , and @entity25 , who works in healthcare			0
friends in high places : the machine is endorsed by celebrity chef @entity27 ( pictured ) and is a cross between a bicycle and trike , relying on wood chips for fuel for when the chips are n't down : the bike works by burning wood chips ( pictured ) inside the contraption ’s biomass engine , which gives off gas that is condensed into steam			1

they are currently testing their new technology on moorland near @entity85 , @entity9 and hope one to day to see it power homes and other devices			1
mr @entity24 said : ‘ no - one has made any developments in steam technology for 200 years			0
‘ the motoring manufacturers are locked into what they are doing			0
the funding does n’t exist for this			0
‘ once we can put together the engine it will be a platform to demonstrate what we are doing and give us data			0
’ the bike can currently do around 25 miles for every 2.2lbs ( 1kg ) of wood chips and takes about five minutes to start up			2
mr @entity25 explained : ‘ it wo n’t replace the car , it might not work for bikes , but [ it may work ] for a small generator , for taking you off grid			0
the unusual bike is being put through its paces on the moors of @entity85 in @entity9 ( shown on this map ) the trio of inventors hope one to day to see their biogas engine power homes and other devices			1
here , they release a flame from the prototype engine ‘ we do n’t have a lot of trees in @entity9 but there will be countries that could use this technology			2
’ the trio say renewable energy experts from the @entity128 have expressed an interest in their designs			0
they are currently raising funds via the @entity133 website for further research into the so - called @entity135 , which is backed by @entity136 boss @entity27			2
he said : ‘ i ca n’t resist getting behind these guys , if only so i can get a step closer to my dream of a carbon neutral wood - chip powered flail mower for @entity136			0
and maybe an eco-jet ski			0

three inventors from @entity9 came up with the steam - powered **vehicle**
they hope the biogas engine could one day be used to power homes
wood chips are burnt inside the **vehicle** *'s* biomass engine and riders pump air into an ' expansion motor ' to generate one horsepower
invention is being tested on moorland near @entity85 and the machine is endorsed by celebrity chef @entity27
