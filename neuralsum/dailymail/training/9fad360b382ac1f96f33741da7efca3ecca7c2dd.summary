by @entity0 published : 17:48 est , 5 june 2012 updated : 19:34 est , 5 june 2012 they were filed away and for nearly 150 years , but now researchers have found the report of the young army surgeon who was first to reach @entity5 after he was shot in the head in @entity7			1
the 21 - page report , written by dr @entity9 , a 23 - year - old doctor just six weeks into his medical practice who happened to be 40 feet from @entity5 , details his original perceptions of the president ’s fatal injuries			1
the historians who discovered the report in the @entity16 in @entity17 believe it was filed , packed in a box , stored at the archives and not seen for 147 years			2
loss of a president : @entity22 , an actor and @entity24 nationalist , shot and killed president @entity5 during a performance at the @entity26 in @entity17 on april 14 , 1865 clinical report : dr @entity9 , 23 , the first to treat @entity5 after he was shot , wrote a detailed report on his treatment hours after the shooting ; the documents were recently discovered at the @entity16 discovery : 147 years after the shooting , a researcher has discovered an original copy of dr @entity9 's clinical 21 - page report from the night @entity5 was shot the doctor , who sat 40 feet from @entity5 at @entity26 that night in april 1865 , saw @entity22 jump to the stage , brandishing a dagger , and heard the cry that the ' president has been murdered ' before pushing his way through the crowd			1
@entity5 : @entity5 , the 16th president , led the country through the @entity46 thinking @entity5 had been stabbed , dr @entity9 ordered men to cut off the president 's coat			1
' i commenced to examine his head ( as no wound near the shoulder was found ) and soon passed my fingers over a large firm clot of blood situated about one inch below the superior curved line of the occipital bone , ' dr @entity9 reported			1
‘ the coagula i easily removed and passed the little finger of my left hand through the perfectly smooth opening made by the ball , and found that it had entered the encephalon			0
' dr @entity9 ’s long - lost report also states that he immediately ‘ sent a gentleman for brandy and water , ’ and that he found the @entity5 ‘ in a state of general paralysis			1
’ he describes : ‘ his eyes were closed and he was in a profoundly comatose condition , while his breathing was intermittent and exceedingly stertorous			0
’ a researcher for the papers of @entity5 , @entity77 , found it among correspondence of the @entity81 surgeon general from april 1865 , filed under ' l ' for @entity9			1
' what 's fascinating about this report is its immediacy and its clinical , just - the - facts approach , ' @entity82 , director of the papers of @entity5 , told the @entity88			1
' there 's not a lot of flowery language , not a lot of emotion			2
' physicians have long debated whether mr @entity5 could have lived with modern medicine			1
trauma treatment was virtually unknown in 1865 , and dr @entity9 's report illustrates ' the helplessness of the doctors , ' mr @entity82 said			1
' he does n't say that but you can feel it			0
' loss of a leader : an artist 's rendering that appeared in @entity106 depicts the grisly murder from another angle help nearby : @entity9 was some 40ft away from the president and rushed to his aide after the shooting at @entity7 dr @entity9 wrote a report for an 1867 congressional committee investigating the assassination that referenced the earlier account , but no one had ever seen it , said mr @entity82 , whose group 's goal is to find every document written by or to @entity5 during his lifetime			1
at least four researchers have been painstakingly scouring boxes of documents at the @entity16 for more than six years			0
they methodically pull boxes of paper - there are millions of documents packed away and never catalogued , mr @entity82 said - and look for ' @entity5 docs , ' as ms @entity129 called them			1
assassination site : @entity26 , located in @entity17 , was playing ' @entity131 ' on april 14 , 1865 consequences : on july 7 , 1865 , three men and one woman were hanged in @entity17 for their parts in the crime : mrs. @entity137 , @entity138 , @entity139 , and @entity140 she was assigned the surgeon general 's documents and was leafing through letters pitching inventions for better ambulances and advice about feeding soldiers onions to ward off disease when she hit dr @entity9 's report			1
' i knew it was interesting			0
what we did n't know was this was novel , ' ms @entity129 said			0
' we did n't know that this was new , that this was an 1865 report and that it likely had n't been seen before			1
' the surgeon never spoke or wrote about his experiences again until 1909 in a speech commemorating the centennial of @entity5 's birth			1
the papers of @entity5 , administered by the @entity166 in @entity167 , has found and is digitizing 90,000 documents , mr @entity82 said			2
i arrived at @entity26 about 8¼ p.m. april 14/65 and procured a seat in the dress circle about 40 feet from the president ’s @entity172			2
the play was then progressing and in a few minutes i saw the president , mrs @entity176 , @entity177 and miss @entity178 enter ; while proceeding to the box they were seen by the audience who cheered which was reciprocated by the president and mrs @entity176 by a smile and bow			2
the party was preceded by an attendant who after opening the door of the box and closing it after they had all entered , took a seat nearby for himself			0
the theatre was well filled and the play of “ @entity131 ” progressed very pleasantly until about half past ten , when the report of a pistol was distinctly heard and about a minute after a man of low stature with black hair and eyes was seen leaping to the stage beneath , holding in his hand a drawn dagger			1
while descending his heel got entangled in the @entity81 flag , which was hung in front of the box , causing him to stumble when he struck the stage , but with a single bound he regained the use of his limbs and ran to the opposite side of the stage , flourishing in his hand a drawn dagger and disappearing behind the scene			0
i then heard cries that the ' president had been murdered , ' which were followed by those of ' kill the murderer ' ' shoot him ' etc. which came from different parts of the audience			2
i immediately ran to the @entity224 box and as soon as the door was opened was admitted and introduced to mrs. @entity176 when she exclaimed several times , ' @entity222 , do what you can for him , do what you can ! ' i told her we would do all that we possibly could			0
when i entered the box the ladies were very much excited			0
mr. @entity5 was seated in a high backed arm - chair with his head leaning towards his right side supported by @entity176 who was weeping bitterly			1
miss @entity178 was near her left and behind the president			2
while approaching the president i sent a gentleman for brandy and another for water			2
when i reached the president he was in a state of general paralysis , his eyes were closed and he was in a profoundly comatose condition , while his breathing was intermittent and exceedingly stertorous			2
i placed my finger on his right radial pulse but could perceive no movement of the artery			0
as two gentlemen now arrived , i requested them to assist me to place him in a recumbent position , and as i held his head and shoulders , while doing this my hand came in contact with a clot of blood near his left shoulder			0
supposing that he had been stabbed there i asked a gentleman to cut his coat and shirt off from that part , to enable me if possible to check the hemorrhage which i supposed took place from the subclavian artery or some of its branches			0
before they had proceeded as far as the elbow i commenced to examine his head ( as no wound near the shoulder was found ) and soon passed my fingers over a large firm clot of blood situated about one inch below the superior curved line of the occipital bone			0
the coagula i easily removed and passed the little finger of my left hand through the perfectly smooth opening made by the ball , and found that it had entered the encephalon			0
as soon as i removed my finger a slight oozing of blood followed and his breathing became more regular and less stertorous			0
the brandy and water now arrived and a small quantity was placed in his mouth , which passed into his stomach where it was retained			0
dr. @entity297 and dr. @entity298 now arrived and after a moments consultation we agreed to have him removed to the nearest house , which we immediately did , the above named with others assisting			0
when we arrived at the door of the box , the passage was found to be densely crowded by those who were rushing towards that part of the theatre			0
i called out twice ' guards clear the passage , ' which was so soon done that we proceeded without a moments delay with the president and were not in the slightest interrupted until he was placed in bed in the house of mr @entity315 , opposite the theatre , in less than 20 minutes from the time he was assassinated			2
