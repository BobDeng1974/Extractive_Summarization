@entity0 readily admits that he fell out with every manager he played for — often because they felt he had an unsuitable attitude for a modern footballer			1
but as he recalls playing for the likes of @entity6 , @entity7 and @entity8 and explains why he decided to retire from football aged just 29 , @entity0 hardly appears to be someone with a problem			1
it was bold , maybe foolhardy , to give up potentially millions in earnings and a dream profession , but @entity0 spent his entire career struggling with the restraints of the game			1
‘ i did it for enjoyment			2
when you get to the top level it becomes a job			1
‘ there were a lot of reasons why at certain times i did n’t play			2
my point of view clashed with others			2
i fell out with pretty much every manager			1
they have five games now to save their job ( so ) if they see someone laughing and joking and having fun all the time , it might look like you ’re not serious about saving their job			1
’ growing up , @entity0 viewed football differently			1
he looked up to players who , in his view , broke free from the commercial , @entity63 - driven agenda which , he believes , shackles @entity65 players			1
his idols were @entity67 and @entity68			2
his favourite player was @entity70			1
@entity0 was fascinated by their charisma and stage presence			2
idols : @entity0 worshiped @entity68 and @entity70 when he was growing up in @entity75 ‘ i always looked at how players were as people , as a sort of performer , ’ he says , ‘ their stage presence was unbelievable			1
they could touch the ball four times but i loved watching them			2
‘ nowadays you do n’t see character and charisma			2
every team plays the same , every player does the same thing			1
you are n’t going to remember any of them			2
even the best players in the world — they just do their job and they ’re a brand , controlled by an army behind them			1
‘ i was never really good at that			2
my flaw was i ’d never touch my toes and take it like a good boy			2
’ it was april 1 , 2013 when @entity0 knew it was all over			2
he had gone back on loan to @entity28 and was starting a championship match against @entity108			2
but it just did not feel right any more			1
he knew it was not what he wanted			2
it was his last game of professional football			1
‘ i ’d gone back to @entity28 to try to get ignited again , to love the game again , ’ he remembers			2
‘ and i just thought , it ’s not for me			0
i ’d stopped enjoying it			0
i knew i was n’t going to do it again			0
’ calling time : @entity0 says when he was named on the bench for @entity28 against @entity108 during his second spell at the club he knew it was time for him to retire from the game final games : @entity0 steers the ball past @entity127 's @entity126 during an @entity129 match in 2013 @entity0 spoke to his agent , @entity130 — who he had been with since he was 15 — and friends and family about the decision			1
it is now all about family for @entity0			0
he has a stake in @entity137 , a restaurant chain in @entity138 which is soon to expand to @entity139 , but his partner @entity140 , daughter @entity141 and his newborn twins are his life now			1
the family have moved to @entity138 , although they came back for a spell so the twins would be born in @entity139			1
he arrives for this interview at a @entity150 hotel pushing the twins in a double pram , his wife and daughter in tow and with a big smile on his face			0
@entity141 interrupts early in our discussion to try to get daddy to come and play			0
‘ i ’ve got work to do , ’ he says			0
then asks : ‘ how much do you love me out of 10 ? ’ @entity141 holds up 10 fingers			0
‘ is that all ? ’ he asks again			0
she gives him a big hug			0
under the spotlight : @entity0 celebrates with @entity167 during his early days at @entity168 as a young player , @entity0 had it all			1
he trained with @entity168 ’s invincibles aged just 16 — having joined the north @entity75 club at 13 — playing alongside footballing greats @entity174 , @entity175 , @entity176 and @entity177			0
under @entity6 ’s tutelage he was tipped to become the best player of his generation			1
his ability had him labelled the new @entity181 by then - @entity139 manager @entity182			1
and @entity181 seconded that view			0
@entity0 played with flair and without fear , never afraid to try a trick and able to land a ball on a sixpence from 60 yards			1
great expectations : people compared @entity0 to @entity181 after his brilliant early performances promise : @entity0 showed signs of brilliance as a teenager for @entity168 and during a loan spell at @entity197 with that mixture of attitude and talent , he scored terrific goals — such as the 40 - yard volley against @entity168 shortly after moving to @entity27 , one of the moments for which he will be most remembered			1
but @entity0 could not force his way through at @entity168 and , as an ambitious 19 - year - old , he wanted to play			0
after a loan spell at @entity197 , he found his calling at @entity28			0
that was where he was happiest in football , in his first spell there			1
he initially signed on loan before making the move permanent on the final day of the transfer window in january 2006			0
the next day , he struck the first @entity218 hat - trick conceded by @entity219 to stun them in a 4 - 3 victory			0
at @entity28 he became a star and amid interest from @entity219 , @entity224 , @entity168 and @entity225 , he signed a long - term deal			0
blossomed : in his first spell at @entity28 he got called up to @entity139 squad and was likened to @entity181 ‘ it was a good environment , ’ recalls @entity0			1
‘ there was an old - school mentality			0
there was a family feel to it , i enjoyed going in			1
there were a lot of characters there : @entity239 , @entity240 , @entity241 , @entity242			0
‘ every day it did n’t matter what the score was , who was better at this or that , everyone enjoyed being there , enjoyed each other ’s company			0
’ but that all evaporated when he became the £ 15million man at @entity27 in july 2008 , a figure which had the potential to rise to £ 17m with add - ons			1
it was a hefty price - tag for a 23 - year - old			0
he signed a mammoth , five - year deal with wages in the region of £ 50,000 per week			0
within a week he realised it was the complete opposite of what he had left behind at @entity264			0
highlight : @entity168 goalkeeper @entity265 fails to stop @entity0 's fantastic long - range shot for @entity27 good times : @entity0 celebrates with @entity268 after scoring from distance against @entity270 transfer fee : but @entity0 failed to nail down a first - team spot at @entity273 ‘ it was a difficult environment , ’ he explains			1
‘ i had my opinion of football and i walked into the complete opposite of that			1
i did n’t see it coming			0
’ it failed to work there and four loan spells followed — including becoming the first @entity65 player to grace the @entity284 at @entity285 — before he was substituted in the 62nd minute of that game against @entity108 and it was all over			2
from the very start , seeds of disillusion were already germinating			0
however much he loved playing , @entity0 hated the element of control which plagues the modern game			0
being told what to say , what to wear , where to go , when to do it — do this , be here , say that			0
@entity0 believes this cripples ability and expression on the field			0
shipped out : @entity0 was allowed to leave @entity27 on loan , with @entity306 one of his brief destinations @entity309 : the former @entity139 international spent time at @entity311 in 2011 ‘ it ’s why @entity139 fail , ’ he explains			1
‘ that ’s why we ’ll never produce players			2
it ’s about the mindset of the @entity65 game			0
‘ you look at @entity320 or @entity321 ; do you think @entity322 or @entity323 are much better ? are they genetically built better ? or is it just in their mind ? ‘ when @entity322 or @entity323 go out on the field they ’re relaxed			0
they love to play , with their heart			0
young @entity65 players are mentally polluted so they ca n’t express themselves			1
‘ @entity139 will always struggle at major tournaments until somebody comes in to change the whole system			1
i played at every @entity139 youth level going and it was exactly the same			1
’ @entity0 captained @entity338 , was called up to play an @entity340 match after a scintillating season in 2006 - 07 at @entity28 and was soon in the senior side			2
but his @entity139 period , when he won seven caps , was mired in controversy			1
pedigree : @entity0 appeared for the @entity139 senior team seven times during his career in 2007 , he was called up by @entity350 for the @entity352 squad to play in the @entity353 but pulled out , citing the need to rest			1
it went down dreadfully in @entity139 ’s upper echelons and @entity182 punished him by exclusion from a friendly against @entity360			1
when he eventually made his senior debut against @entity363 , some @entity139 fans booed him			1
he laughs it off and adds : ‘ it ’s the control element in football that ’s difficult to handle every day			2
these days it ’s a business			2
i never saw it that way			0
‘ i ’m so grateful for the game and what it gave me , especially financially , but i never wanted to play like that			0
‘ i ’d coach my kids ’ teams but i ’d never go back to professional football			1
i do n’t think it can be changed			0
it ’s like politics now			0
’ people stop @entity0 in the street and ask him why he ’s packed it all in , given up the flow of riches , the dream			0
but , with a shrug , he responds : ‘ i just tell them i ’m happy			0
