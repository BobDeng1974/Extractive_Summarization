by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter published : 17:28 est , 25 april 2012 updated : 17:43 est , 25 april 2012 the @entity4 @entity3 appeared to endorse @entity6 's immigration crackdown on wednesday , rejecting the @entity8 administration stance that the federal government has sole power over those who illegally enter the @entity4			1
justices suggested by their questions and comments that states have significant latitude to adopt laws that discourage illegal immigrants from moving to and staying in the country			0
@entity6 two years ago became the first of half a dozen @entity4 states to pass laws aimed at driving illegal immigrants out , including requiring police to check the immigration status of anyone detained and suspected of being in the country illegally			2
the battle over the law goes to the heart of a fierce national debate between @entity70 and @entity71 over what to do with the estimated 11.5 million illegal immigrants in the country , a number that has held steady in recent years			0
critics have said the @entity6 law could lead to ethnic and racial profiling of the fast - growing @entity80 population , now equal to 16 per cent of all @entity4			2
the four conservatives - chief justice @entity82 and justices @entity57 , @entity84 , and @entity85 - all asked tough questions of the administration 's lawyer			0
@entity89 , right , argues for @entity6 ; justices , from left are , @entity92 , @entity93 , @entity94 , @entity84 , chief justice @entity82 , @entity57 , @entity95 , and @entity85 solicitor general @entity96 speaks before the @entity3 a decision for the @entity6 law would be a setback for president @entity8 , who has criticized it and has vowed to push for immigration legislation if re-elected on november 6			1
@entity71 presidential candidate @entity101 has said the government should drop its challenge to the law			0
@entity82 , who also could play a key role in deciding the case , spurned the administration 's arguments that the @entity6 law conflicted with the federal system and deemed it ' an effort to help you enforce federal law			1
' other parts of the @entity6 law require immigrants to carry their papers at all times ; ban illegal immigrants from soliciting work in public places ; and allow police to arrest immigrants without a warrant if an officer believes they have committed a crime that would make them deportable			1
@entity127 justices @entity93 and @entity92 asked how long suspected illegal immigrants could be held by authorities while their status was checked and whether that would violate their constitutional rights			0
there will be a ' significant number of people detained for a significantly longer period of time , ' @entity93 said			0
the third liberal hearing the case , @entity95 , asked more broadly about whether @entity6 's new law conflicted with federal policy : ' we do n't want competing ... schemes			1
' fellow conservative justice @entity94 did not ask any questions but is expected to support the @entity6 law , based on his past votes			2
the @entity3 's immigration ruling is likely to come by the end of june , as the political campaign season heats up			1
it is expected around the same time justices are likely to rule on president @entity8 's 2010 healthcare overhaul law			1
the case , heard on the last day of oral arguments for the annual term , drew more than 100 reporters to the courtroom press seats and scores of people on the sidewalk outside the building			0
the immigration dispute is the second most important case of the term , following the healthcare dispute heard in march			0
only eight of the nine @entity3 justices heard the arguments			0
liberal justice @entity166 , the former top @entity8 administration lawyer at the court , recused herself because she had worked on the matter previously			0
her fellow liberal justices appeared to accept that the conservative majority would vote to uphold at least part of the @entity6 law and focused their questions on how those provisions , which have been on hold during the litigation , would be applied on the ground			2
@entity82 tried to cut off the argument that the @entity6 law would lead to ethnic and racial profiling of @entity80 by interrupting the government attorney 's opening statement and asserting that profiling was not at issue in the case			2
the arguments , the last of the court 's 2011 - 12 term , offered a rematch of the same attorneys who squared off in last month 's historic battle over @entity8 's healthcare overhaul law			1
@entity89 , a solicitor general during @entity71 @entity194 's presidency , represented @entity6 and its @entity71 governor , @entity42			2
he argued that @entity6 , on the southwest border with @entity197 , bears a disproportionate share of the costs from illegal immigration			0
he said that state 's law simply complemented the federal government 's efforts			0
anti @entity30 : a man , right , holds up a sign with a flame that reads ' @entity209 ' @entity210 , @entity211 : @entity212 , a @entity214 resident , second from left , and others take part in a demonstration in front of the @entity3 showing support : a man waves a placard in favour of @entity6 's @entity30 law			1
@entity197 said the controversial law ' poses an imminent threat to @entity197 - @entity4 bilateral relations ' @entity96 , a former @entity228 lawyer and now solicitor general under @entity8 , argued @entity6 's law would result in ' mass incarceration ' of people unlawfully present in the @entity4 and posed the risk of ' significant foreign relations problems			1
' the conservative @entity84 scoffed at that argument , saying that any problems could be avoided by releasing the people from jail and deporting them			0
the @entity3 last year upheld a different @entity6 law that penalizes businesses for hiring illegal immigrants , and @entity82 at one point cited that decision as a precedent			1
the @entity3 case is @entity6 v. @entity4 , no. 11 - 182			2
in mockery : demonstrators against the state 's @entity30 immigration law hold masks of @entity6 governor @entity42 and @entity252 sheriff @entity251 before a rally and march in @entity214 nerves : religious members of the @entity80 community in @entity6 pray on the lawn of the state capital during the @entity3 hearings			1

@entity3 seems to endorse @entity6 's controversial immigration law
rulings likely to carry on into june
*positive* ruling could *potentially* *damage* @entity8 's re-election campaign
