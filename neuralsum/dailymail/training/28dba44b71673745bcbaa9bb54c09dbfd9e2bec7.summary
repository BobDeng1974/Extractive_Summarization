glamorous in a black lace gown and a sparkling diamond tiara , @entity2 's @entity1 @entity0 was every inch the royal style icon as she arrived for a state dinner in @entity8 last night			1
the event , which was held to honour @entity10 , the visiting president of @entity11 , took place in the @entity13			2
ms @entity10 , who was elected in march , also chose a glamorous lace get - up , albeit in elegant grey rather than dramatic black			1
the encounter with the @entity2 couple is not , however , ms @entity10 's first brush with a royal since taking the helm			1
in june , ms @entity10 , a socialist , was left beaming after prince @entity42 made a state visit to the country and met with her at the @entity45 in @entity46			1
this time around , the president , who seems to be at risk of becoming a monarchist , was left smiling after a chat with @entity28 during the ceremony and was seen beaming broadly later on during the state dinner			0
ms @entity10 is in @entity2 for high level talks aimed at boosting trade relations between her @entity56 nation and the @entity57			2
enjoying her stay : ms @entity10 , although a socialist , appeared entirely at ease in the royals ' company visit : the @entity11 president is on a two - day visit aimed at boosting trade between @entity11 and @entity2 glamorous : @entity0 chose unusually dramatic make - up , including a red lip , for the event @entity0 , meanwhile , is fresh from a successful trip to @entity69 where she made a speech at the @entity71 in @entity72			1
the speech , which was made partly in @entity74 and in @entity75 , was to art fans during the launch of an exhibition dedicated to the @entity2 artist , @entity79			0
@entity79 , who was born in 1599 , is best known for his 1656 work , @entity81 , which is usually housed in @entity8 's @entity82			0
the painting , which shows @entity84 surrounded by her maids of honour and servants , was commissioned by @entity88 - an ancestor of the current @entity28			0
@entity81 also has an @entity69 connection as @entity84 went on to become the @entity90 and wife of @entity92 who oversaw the running of his lands from the @entity95 in @entity72			0
it was also at the @entity95 that @entity84 died in 1673 aged just 21 , although not before she gave her husband four children , all of whom - @entity99 , @entity100 notwithstanding - died in childhood			0
lovely to see you again : the couple looked thrilled to see a glamorous - looking ms @entity10 at dinner in danger : ms @entity10 , who seems to be in danger of becoming a monarchist , was all smiles during dinner first visit : prince @entity42 , pictured here in @entity46 , was the first royal to shake the hand of the @entity11 president pomp : the welcome ceremony at the @entity34 saw the royals take a salute from an honour guard the look of love : @entity28 and @entity1 @entity0 exchanged glances as they waited for president @entity10 delighted : ms @entity10 appeared almost as delighted to meet @entity28 as she was to meet prince @entity42 all smiles : president @entity10 waved to photographers as she was escorted into the @entity34 by @entity1 @entity0 despite the tragic story behind @entity81 , it remains one of @entity79 ' most famous paintings , if not the only one he did of @entity84			1
@entity0 , although not famous for her love of art , has made supporting her native culture a key part of her role , and , last week , joined @entity28 for the launch of a new @entity2 language dictionary			2
much of her time has also been spent travelling , with successful visits to the @entity135 in @entity136 and to @entity137 and @entity138 in the @entity139 alongside @entity28 , among her most recent trips			0
dramatic : the smartly uniformed honour guard formed a dramatic backdrop for the welcome ceremony esteem : unusually , the ceremony was held at the grand @entity34 instead of the @entity13 all smiles : after bowing his head for the @entity148 , @entity28 beamed broadly at the soldiers on parade stylish : as is her wont , queen @entity0 cut a glamorous figure as she made her way down the @entity34 's steps			2
