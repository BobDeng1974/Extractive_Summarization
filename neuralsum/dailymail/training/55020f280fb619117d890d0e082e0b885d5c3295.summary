school authorities had ' no knowledge of trip ' or of its planning ' they said by @entity5 published : 07:33 est , 14 april 2013 updated : 01:45 est , 15 april 2013 the @entity6 risked the lives of students by using them as a ‘ human shield ’ for a controversial @entity12 journalist and his film crew , it was claimed yesterday			1
the undercover team travelled with ten students from the @entity16 to @entity17 last month			2
had the journalists been discovered , the whole group would have faced arrest , interrogation and possible detention			1
parents and university officials claim the students – the youngest of whom was only 18 – were ‘ deliberately misled ’ by the @entity6 and have called on the broadcaster to apologise and drop the @entity12 documentary , due to be aired tonight			1
three @entity12 journalists are said to have put lives in danger as they secretly filmed inside the highly authoritarian country the students were invited on the trip via an @entity16 club , only to learn much later it had been organised by @entity12 as a cover for its investigation			1
journalist @entity31 insisted the students had all agreed to enter the rogue communist state with him , but admitted he withheld some details of the trip on the advice of @entity6 risk assessors			1
the @entity16 said its students were not given enough information to give their consent and accused the @entity6 of taking unacceptable risks at a time when sabre - rattling by @entity17 had already raised tensions with the @entity57			2
@entity59 , general secretary of @entity58 said students and the university had been ‘ manipulated ’			2
‘ i think the trip was organised by the @entity6 as a ruse to get into @entity17 and that ’s disgraceful , ’ she said			1
‘ they have used students essentially as a human shield in this situation			2
’ three of the students have complained , the university says			0
one said they were not told about key details of the subterfuge until en route for @entity77			0
students have since received ‘ threatening ’ letters from @entity17 authorities and one parent has complained in writing to new @entity6 director - general lord hall that their child was put in danger			1
the parent wrote : ‘ the methods adopted potentially endangered a number of students who believed they were participating in an organised student tour			0
i am outraged that in this case the @entity6 , without obtaining “ informed consent ” ... deceived , used and endangered these students to obtain a story from @entity17			0
’ the row could prove embarrassing for @entity82 , appointed after his predecessor @entity95 quit in the wake of the @entity98 scandal and the botched @entity100 report which led to @entity101 being wrongly identified as a paedophile			0
a producer for @entity12 resigned earlier this month over claims the programme tried to bribe a security consultant to reveal information about a property developer			1
the @entity16 said it was not given any warning about the @entity6 ’s plans until last week , after the group returned			0
it said the deception had put the students in danger and had jeopardised the safety of its academics working in other high - risk countries			1
the students volunteered for the trip through the @entity120 , a student society linked to the @entity16 ’s department of international relations			1
@entity31 ’s wife @entity124 , an @entity16 graduate , had organised a group tour of @entity17 with the club in 2012 and students were told she was organising this year ’s trip			2
in a letter sent to all members of the university , its management said it was not known to the rest of the party that they were three journalists working for or with the @entity6 in advance of the trip totalitarian : @entity140 is the dictator of the oppressive and murderous regime they were told in @entity143 that a journalist would join them			1
but they were not told of miss @entity124 ’s links to @entity12 or @entity31 until they reached @entity149			1
there , as they waited to board the flight to @entity77 , they were told that a @entity12 film crew , including the high - profile investigative journalist , would be travelling with them for the eight - day trip			1
journalists are banned from entering @entity17 without visas and government minders , so @entity31 posed as a history professor			2
the reporter – who was once filmed ranting at a @entity164 leader during a documentary – likened @entity17 to a ‘ @entity167 state ’ and called the experience more frightening than travelling inside @entity170 ’s @entity169			0
he said : ‘ it ’s extraordinarily scary , dark and evil			0
’ @entity31 said the @entity6 ’s ‘ high risk team ’ had wanted the students to be kept in the dark so they couldnot be accused of being complicit in the subterfuge if it was discovered by the @entity17			0
‘ if we got into @entity17 and i got busted and i ’m a journalist , then we were worried , properly and rightly , for the students			0
so we did not want to tell them everything that we were doing because it would increase the risk for them , ’ he said			0
@entity31 said he believed the majority of the students supported the @entity12 film and praised them as ‘ brave and good people ’			1
but the parent who wrote to @entity82 , who asked not to be identified , said their child had not been told of any journalistic involvement until after they had paid £ 1,969 for their place on the trip			2
the @entity6 admits the group was not told about @entity12 ’s involvement until they were in @entity149			1
one said they were told the delay was ‘ for your own safety ’			0
@entity16 deputy director professor @entity199 said : ‘ we were told the @entity6 had undertaken a risk assessment and it had been approved at the highest level			0
‘ the @entity16 believes that any reasonable assessor of risk – or indeed any parent contemplating their son or daughter going on such a trip with the involvement of the @entity6 – would have thought the risks quite unacceptable			2
’ gaining false admission to @entity17 is punishable by imprisonment and heavy fines			0
@entity6 head of programmes @entity215 said the deception was justified and refused to drop the film , defending it as an ‘ important piece of public interest journalism ’			0
‘ the only people we deceived in the making of this film were the @entity17 government , ’ he added			0
a @entity6 spokesman said mr @entity31 ’s wife had organised the trip before @entity12 became involved .			1
