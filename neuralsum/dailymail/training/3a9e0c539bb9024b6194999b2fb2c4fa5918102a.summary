by @entity0 when she awoke from a 14 - week coma caused by a deadly brain condition , @entity2 's family were happy just to see her awake			1
however , their joy at her recovery soon turned to worry as they discovered she had lost most of her memories - and even how to talk , read and write			1
@entity2 , 24 , could not even remember that she did n't like to eat bananas after her brain was damaged by encephalitis - swelling of the brain			1
remembering : @entity2 , 24 , lost her memories to a brain condition , but is rediscovering her past through photo albums with the help of her mother , @entity21 , 52 , and other family members			1
reminders : this collage of photographs from her past helps @entity2 find out about the memories she has lost piecing together : @entity2 is using the albums and scrapbooks to reassemble her past , which she says is like a ' jigsaw ' but in the two years since waking up , she has been able to rediscover her life thanks to photo albums and diaries painstakingly put together by her friends and family			1
@entity2 , from @entity36 , @entity37 , said : ' when i look through the scrapbooks from mum and the rest of the family i ’m just overwhelmed with emotion			1
' i just started crying when i looked through it , i could n’t believe i had been through all this and had no recollection of it at all			0
' my mum and family must have been terrified when i was ill and when i looked at the scrapbooks she ’d made , i could n’t believe that i ’d done so many things that i had no memory of			1
' i ’m now unsure whether the memories i have are those of my own or just from photographs and other people ’s memories - but i ’m so thankful to my mum for going to so much trouble			1
' @entity2 caught the disease - usually caused by the herpes simplex virus that also causes cold sores and chicken pox - after returning from a family holiday to the @entity65			1
snapshots : @entity2 says she is n't sure whether the photographs bring her memories back , or whether she learns them again re-learning : @entity2 struggled even to speak after she woke up , but is re-learning language with help from her loved ones struggle : @entity2 had also lost the ability to write - as this attempt at spelling her own name shortly after she recovered shows learning : but she gradually improved , as can be seen in these later writing exercises the condition - which can be fatal - causes excess fluid and swelling inside the skull , and can lead to brain damage			1
in @entity2 ’s case , her immune system responded by attacking her own brain , which did even more damage			1
she said : ' i was lying on the floor at home and began having a seizure			0
' that ’s the last thing i remember			0
it ’s only thanks to reading my mum ’s diary that i learned about what happened to me			0
' when she woke up , 14 weeks after doctors were forced to sedate her , huge chunks of her life were missing , including birthdays , holidays and her time studying psychology at university			2
her mother @entity21 , 52 , and sister @entity105 , were shocked at her condition but resolved to help her remember who she was using @entity109 - style scrapbooks			1
@entity21 said : ' i tested @entity2 ’s memory by asking her if she liked bananas , which i know she hates , and when she said she liked them my stomach sunk as i knew that her memory had been affected			2
hospitalised : @entity2 was struck down by encephalitis - a potentially fatal swelling of the brain bruised : the condition also left @entity2 with worrying marks on her arms , left , and legs , right medicine : as part of her recovery , @entity2 has to take all of the pictured tablets on a daily basis ' @entity2 had regressed back to being like a small child when she woke up from the sedation and so we had to teach her everything all over again			1
' when she was trying to string a sentence together she would just forget a word as she was talking , she still does it now			0
' her determination to learn to walk again was incredible and she was back on her feet quickly but we knew this would be a long road to recovery			0
' @entity21 , a gp , could n’t understand what was happening when @entity2 first became ill and doctors were equally as baffled			2
it was n’t until blood tests sent to @entity144 were looked at that the doctors had an idea of what was happening to her daughter			0
she said : ' i was so worried when she first fell ill , she just changed and became a whole other person			0
' when they said they wanted to sedate her i knew it was something serious and all i could think was how much i wanted her to be better again			0
together : @entity2 ( second from left ) has been helped through her recovery by her mother @entity21 ( left ) , father @entity158 ( right ) and sister @entity159 ( second from right ) road to recovery : @entity2 , left , and @entity21 , right , have worked hard to recover her old life and allow her to move on confidence : @entity2 is currently unable to work , but volunteers with the encephalitis society to help people in a similar position to her ' i kept a diary of everything that went on as it was good for me to write it down and get my feelings written down			1
' i also decided to create the scrapbooks so that @entity2 would have something to go through to remember the things she forgot			1
' i am so glad she ca n’t remember the time that she was ill as it was such a traumatic time , i would n’t want her to keep that memory			0
' while @entity2 remembered some parts of her life , she claims that her memories are like a jigsaw without all of its pieces			1
@entity2 has been unable to work as she still has relapses and has n’t built up the confidence she once had before			2
@entity2 said : ' i do a lot of voluntary work with @entity188 and they have helped me in so many ways			2
' there are a lot of other young people who have been through a similar situation to mine and it has such a devastating effect			0
' people assume that memory loss comes with age but this disease takes memory from young people who have barely been able to make that many memories			0
' i studied psychology at university and so learning about the human mind and then having this happen to me was so ironic			0
memories : @entity2 , pictured left with her sisters @entity105 and @entity159 , is using photographs to remember moments like this , which she otherwise has no recollection of recollection : the photographs help @entity2 piece together events such as this holiday to @entity220 in the @entity65 faces and places : @entity2 , here with her ex-boyfriend @entity223 , said she is trying to look at what happened to her as positively as possible ' it fascinates me how this disease works and how it affects your behaviour and your memory in such an extreme way			1
' ' i ’m not going to let this determine who i am as a person , it does n’t control me			0
' i have met so many great people through the encephalitis society and have been given so many great opportunities			0
' you could look at all the things that have changed in a negative way because of this but i just prefer to look on a more positive side and look at what i can do to help instead			0
' @entity246 , operations manager of @entity188 , said that @entity2 's fight to regain her life is typical of people who suffer from the disease			2
she said : ' @entity2 has shown amazing strength of character since being affected by @entity253			2
' as with any case , it was a highly traumatic time for @entity2 and her family , and it shows just how devastating this condition can be			1
' like many others , she was left to pick up the pieces and start again , learning to walk and talk			0
' as well as raising funds for @entity188 , @entity2 is now an @entity261 accredited @entity262 , where she offers guidance , help and support for others who have been affected			2
' it ’s a service that is absolutely invaluable to our charity			0
it ’s an absolute pleasure to have @entity2 on our team and we ’re very proud of her accomplishments			2
