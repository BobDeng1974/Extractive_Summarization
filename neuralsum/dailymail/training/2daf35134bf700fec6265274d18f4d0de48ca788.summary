@entity6 admitted that heads could roll if corporation bosses were found to have acted improperly concern : he said he feared that the television and radio star may have been helped in his sordid sexual exploitation of teenage girls by other @entity4 employees @entity6 also suggested the @entity4 was likely to broadcast a prime - time apology if the inquiries into @entity24 came back with damning findings			1
yesterday the former @entity27 mp asked director - general @entity28 to review the corporation ’s guidelines on child protection following what he called the ‘ appalling ’ allegations of sexual abuse against @entity35			1
he also said an independent inquiry at the @entity4 , supervised by an outside figure , should be started as swiftly as possible following a police investigation into @entity2 ’s activities			1
former patients at @entity42 in @entity43 and another in @entity44 yesterday claimed they had been assaulted during visits by @entity2 in the 1970s and 1980s			2
teenagers in wheelchairs and others recovering from cancer were among those said to have fallen victim to the @entity52 one claimed nurses told young patients to pretend to be asleep whenever the star visited their wards			0
@entity6 is among those at the @entity4 struggling to explain who knew what and when about the dropping of a @entity58 investigation into allegations against @entity35 and in @entity66 , @entity67 , his elaborate tombstone was removed from a cemetery at midnight out of respect for ‘ public opinion ’			1
police have said they believe @entity2 was a ‘ predatory sex offender ’ who could have abused up to 30 victims over a period of more than 40 years beginning in 1959			1
@entity6 and others at the @entity4 are still struggling to explain who knew what and when about the decision to drop a @entity58 investigation into allegations against @entity2			1
on sunday former director - general @entity80 , who left his post last month , said he had never heard any rumours or received any complaints or allegations about @entity24 when he was in charge			2
but yesterday @entity6 – who said he himself first heard about the @entity24 allegations less than two weeks ago when he read about them in a newspaper – insisted said mr @entity80 had been made aware of the @entity58 investigation last december by director of news @entity90			1
@entity6 insisted said @entity80 , left , had been made aware of the @entity58 investigation last december by director of news @entity90 , right when asked to confirm that the former director - general knew about the investigation , he said : ‘ yes ’			2
his comments were later retracted by the @entity95 , which said he ‘ misspoke ’ on the matter			0
when asked if he was convinced there were not others taking part or helping @entity2 with these type of activities at the @entity4 , @entity6 said : ‘ no ’			1
he also said that bosses could lose their jobs if they were found guilty of impropriety over their handling of the issue			2
addressing a @entity108 lunch yesterday , @entity6 began with the words : ‘ i would like to say one or two things about the appalling allegations and the cesspit of the @entity2 allegations			1
’ but later there were tough questions for him to answer about how current @entity4 director - general @entity116 could oversee the organising the independent inquiry when he was one of the executives facing questions about what he knew			2
under scrutiny : @entity122 has formally recorded eight criminal allegations - two rapes and six indecent assaults - against the former tv presenter so far in its @entity128 investigation mr @entity28 was one of the executives who were told about the @entity58 investigation into @entity24 last year , although it is denied he knew the exact nature of the allegations			2
there had been criticism that the @entity4 had ditched the investigation on its @entity58 programme late last year because it would have run counter to other celebratory shows about the once popular presenter which were then being prepared for broadcast			2
but @entity6 said yesterday the editor of @entity58 was ‘ not leaned on ’ , and no @entity4 executives had intervened			1
earlier this week mr @entity28 made an apology to @entity2 ’s victims during an interview on @entity149 ’s today programme and said there would be an inquiry to follow the police investigation			1
inquiry : @entity6 said he was sure the @entity4 inquiry will look into allegations made by other presenters such as @entity158 , who revealed she was groped by a colleague while she was on air @entity6 said yesterday : ‘ the @entity4 has in place child protection policies , processes , guidance for us by all staff on and off the premises and independents making programmes for the @entity4			1
‘ we ’ve asked the director - general to assure us that those policies are up to date and fit for purpose that they ’re effective in protecting minors and under - age children			0
‘ we ’ve also said that we want to be satisfied on the arrangements in place for dealing with sexual harassment , bullying and whistleblowing and we want to be sure that those guidelines that do exist are gold standard and up to date and comply with current best practice			0
’ abuse : @entity42 in @entity184 where @entity2 was allegedly free to prey upon young patients , despite the staff knowing about his behaviour @entity6 suggested that the internal inquiry will not look at the editorial decision by @entity58 , saying he did not want to question the ‘ journalistic integrity ’ of people			1
but insiders admitted yesterday that it is likely to look at what bosses did with the information contained within it when they were made aware of the allegations			0
asked what would happen if any current @entity4 employees such as the director general and other executives were found to have acted improperly , @entity6 said : ‘ you would not expect any employee of a newspaper or the @entity4 to survive if her or she was found to have behaved improperly			1
’ he said he was sure the @entity4 inquiry will look into allegations made by other presenters such as @entity158 , who revealed she was groped by a colleague while she was on air			0
@entity122 has formally recorded eight criminal allegations – two rapes and six indecent assaults – against the former @entity215 presenter so far in its @entity128 investigation			0
difficult : funeral director @entity217 said the stone had taken 8 months to create but only hours to tear down gone : the headstone was only put in place three weeks ago and @entity221 and @entity222 became the latest forces to receive complaints of abuse by @entity2 , who died in october last year			0
@entity226 said allegations about his activities have followed day after day following an @entity231 documentary which aired last week			0
@entity2 is today lying in an unmarked grave after a dead - of - night operation to remove his £ 4,000 headstone at the request of his family			2
undertakers worked in the dark to rip out the giant memorial and have said it will ' be broken up , placed in a skip and used as landfill '			0
the gates of @entity243 in @entity66 , @entity67 , were locked at around 11pm on tuesday night and police stood guard for the two - hour operation			0
his loved - ones did not attend and while they had ordered the removal of the grave they were not aware of the undertakers ’ decision to do it in the middle of the night			0
they were to wait until 7am on wednesday before removing the six foot wide by four foot tall headstone with @entity2 ’s now inflammatory epitaph : ' it was good while it lasted			0
' all its inscriptions will be ground away before the stone is destroyed			0
decision : @entity2 's family gave permission for its removal out of respect for public opinion - with the scene shown here at dawn respect : @entity2 's family gave permission for its removal out of respect for public opinion - shown here shortly after it was removed message : a card also left there thanks @entity35 for the times they shared together from a well - wisher called @entity279 below it is @entity2 's body , encased in concrete at a 45 degree angle , so he could ' see ' the sea and @entity66 castle - his dying wish			2
the @entity2 family said in a statement : ' members of the family of sir @entity2 have decided to remove his headstone from the grave in @entity66			0
' the family members are deeply aware of the impact that the stone remaining there could have on the dignity and sanctity of the cemetery			0
' out of respect to public opinion , to those who are buried there , and to those who tend their graves and visit there , we have decided to remove it			0
' the @entity2 family feared the grave could become the centre of a media circus and could have been attacked , so gave funeral director @entity217 a free hand to carry out what he called ' a discreet ' operation .			0
