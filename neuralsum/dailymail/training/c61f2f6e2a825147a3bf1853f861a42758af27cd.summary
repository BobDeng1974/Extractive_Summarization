it has only been used once in the last three years , but a red telephone box in a tiny fishing village will not be removed - after residents mounted a round - the - clock vigil to save it			1
for nearly 30 years , the phone box in @entity8 , on the @entity5 north of @entity6 , was the community 's only means of contact with the outside world and it has come to be cherished as a symbol of life in the @entity15			1
so when @entity18 decided it should go , the village 's 100 residents threw a ring of steel around it			1
blocked : villagers in @entity8 , on the @entity5 north of @entity6 , parked their cars around the red telephone box to stop @entity18 removing it locals drew up a rota and took it in turns to park their vehicles around the payphone to prevent workmen from uprooting it			1
yesterday , people power won the day when @entity18 relented and allowed the village to pay £ 1 to adopt the box – even though it has been disconnected			1
village association chairman @entity35 , 68 , said : ‘ we were prepared to keep our campaign and vigil going for as long it took but thankfully we did n’t have to wait long for victory			2
‘ we will all happily chip in to pay for the upkeep but we do n’t know if it will be reconnected			0
‘ it has been used only once in the past three years so it is n’t that vital			0
but it has affectionately become part of village life			2
’ no way through : @entity18 has relented and allowed the seaside village to pay £ 1 to adopt the phone box ¿ even though it has been disconnected the @entity8 community was horrified last friday when a truck carrying two phone booths arrived to take the box away			1
engineers stopped at a house in the village to ask for directions to the box			2
their request was politely declined and as word swept through the village , locals quickly surrounded the box with their cars to prevent anyone from touching it			1
posters were stuck on the windscreens warning anyone approaching that steps were being taken to prevent access to the box			0
plea : the residents fixed a message to the red telephone box , urging the company not to remove it it read : ‘ the community only heard of the threat to this local landmark on october 2 , 2012 , and steps are being taken to preserve it			1
' our immediate response has been to prevent access to the box with our own vehicles			0
we have informed the police of our actions			0
’ mr @entity35 added : ‘ we then discovered a notice pinned inside the box warning us we had 42 days to save it but since no one ever went inside the kiosk , we did n’t know about it until it was almost too late			0
’ fellow resident @entity93 , 65 , said : ‘ the box used to sit in the middle of the row of houses overlooking the shoreline for years			0
' then one day about 30 years ago , it disappeared , only to mysteriously reappear for re-installation			0
the villagers chose the present location			0
‘ although rarely used , it was an important lifeline for anyone spotting someone in trouble in the @entity107 to alert the emergency authorities			0
‘ we contacted our local councillors and met with the police as well as local @entity18 management and explained our position			2
‘ we were told there was a phone box 400 metres away and this one was no longer required			0
‘ but @entity18 did n’t know it was 400 metres away if you were prepared to scramble along the rocks to the village of @entity120			2
’ a @entity18 spokesman said : ‘ we told @entity122 back in 2008 that we planned to remove it and no objections were raised			1
‘ a year later we launched our well - publicised @entity125 campaign , giving local communities the chance to pay £ 1 to retain their red box and protect their heritage			1
’ here to stay : the red telephone box had only been used once in three years and has now been disconnected , but villagers were determined that it should remain			2
