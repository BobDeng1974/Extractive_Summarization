by @entity0 published : 14:45 est , 21 october 2013 updated : 15:00 est , 21 october 2013 ' unable to spot it ' : the @entity3 plane passed just 1,200ft from the @entity5 jet a fighter pilot was forced to turn on his weapon system in a desperate bid to locate a passing passenger plane during a near - miss incident			1
the @entity5 jet passed just 1,200ft from the @entity12 passenger plane which was had 28 passengers and three crew on - board			1
the fighter pilot was conducting a ' rapid climb ' at 379knots ( 436mph ) from a low level when he was alerted to the presence of an aircraft nearby on may 16 , this year			1
after frantically scanning the skies from his cockpit , the fighter pilot was unable to spot the other aircraft and switched on the gun radar to locate it			1
his attempt failed , but luckily the civilian plane , travelling from @entity28 to @entity29 , was already behind him			0
the @entity32 @entity31 labelled the miss as ‘ @entity34 ’ which means the safety of the two planes were compromised			0
in his comments , the @entity12 pilot said he thought the risk of collision was ' medium ' although the fighter pilot claimed it was ' low ' - this is despite neither pilot being able to see the other ’s plane			1
however , one of the air traffic controllers covering the area at the time claimed there was a ' high ' risk of collision in the incident			0
the @entity31 report states : ' the incident occurred when the @entity5 crew commenced a rapid climb from low level into proximity with the aircraft			2
' it adds that the fighter pilot ' immediately switched the radar from its " search " mode to " guns " mode , a move which still failed to reveal the @entity12 , probably because it was already behind him '			2
the @entity31 concluded the cause of the near - miss was due to the @entity5 pilot climbing ' into conflict with the @entity12 , which he did not see '			2
the matter was complicated as the @entity12 was being handed over to another air traffic control frequency at the time of the @entity5 ’s rapid climb close : the fighter pilot was conducting a ' rapid climb ' at 379knots ( 436mph ) from a low level when he was alerted to the presence of an aircraft nearby ( f - 15 jets pictured here at @entity83 , @entity84 ) a spokesman for @entity3 praised the actions of their flight crew in the incident , who had immediately disengaged the autopilot and steered away from the oncoming fighter jet when alerted to its presence			1
he said : ' the crew of the aircraft had descended to 7,500ft when the aircraft ’s @entity96 have two alerts			0
' the first advised them of traffic nearby and the second alert instructed them to climb immediately , which they did to maintain separation			0
' the findings of the @entity31 report concluded that the @entity109 ’s actions were appropriate			0

fighter pilot doing a rapid climb when he was told of the @entity3 @entity12
he could *n't* see the plane so turned on the gun radar to locate it
