@entity1 recalled on today 's @entity26 how she was shocked and scared to see him outside his house gardening a year after his release from prison			1
' why only a year ? a year does n't do anything , ' she told @entity31 and @entity32			0
as a result , she is now campaigning for the law to be changed with a change.org petition called ' @entity36 ' which has currently gained 390 signatures			1
the teenager said it 's unfair that victims like her seem to have less rights than their attackers			0
ordeal : this morning presenter @entity45 hands @entity1 a tissue as she becomes emotional sharing her story on today 's show she said : ' what i am asking is pretty small - just for zones to be out in place for a longer period			1
how are you supposed to re-build your life ? not everyone has to have them living across the road but it 's still a life sentence , no one should have to live with this			0
' @entity1 explained on the @entity63 show how her ordeal began when she started babysitting for @entity14 and his wife when she was 13			1
she explained : ' before i met @entity66 had a loving family home , school life was good , everything was just normal			2
i was n't very outgoing , i was very family orientated			0
' he was left the house opposite ours when his mother died			0
he and his wife were doing it up so they could move in and i would help babysitting his little girl			0
i would look after her after school and in the holidays			0
' @entity1 said she loved babysitting the little girl and refused to be paid for it by @entity14 and his wife			1
so she did n't think anything of it when @entity14 began lavishing her with expensive gifts			2
she thought it was his way of repaying her for babysitting but now she realises he had been grooming her			0
@entity1 was joined on the sofa by @entity92 , far right , ceo of the @entity93 who are supporting her and her petition for change after enduring sexual abuse at his hands , she eventually found the courage to tell a teacher what was happening and @entity14 was jailed			1
but now he is a free man again , @entity1 feels too scared to live near him in her family home			1
as a result , she has moved away with her partner , @entity103 , 25			0
@entity1 said : ' we hit a brick wall , no - one was prepared to do anything			2
they said it 's his home , he can go where he wants			0

' we thought it would be a safe place to bring @entity1 and our children up			1
we never thought we would be living this nightmare			0
' she added : ' every day i think about what i would like to do to my daughter 's attacker , they are very disturbing thoughts but what gets me through is the welfare of my children			0
' i miss @entity1 every single day			2

i feel guilty that @entity1 is n't part of that and that 's the most difficult thing			2
