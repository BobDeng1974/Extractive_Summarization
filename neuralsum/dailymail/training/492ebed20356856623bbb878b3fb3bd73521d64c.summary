by @entity0 for anyone in the public eye , having pearly white teeth has fast become an essential part of a successful celebrity look			2
tv mogul @entity6 , actress @entity7 and singer @entity8 have all confessed to having their teeth polished in the past to ensure they can flash a @entity13 smile			0
but with cosmetic dentistry treatment costing up to £ 800 a time , cleaning up discoloured teeth is often out of reach of ordinary folk			1
the store say they have been inundated with pre-order enquiries for @entity30 – a best - seller in @entity32 - which professes to make teeth up to six shades whiter in just 30 minutes			1
at £ 49.99 the kit costs a fraction of cosmetic dentistry , but uses similar laser light technology for professional results			1
in clinical trials on 240 people , 86 per cent said their teeth were noticeably whiter within 30 minutes			1
one in eight said their teeth were 50 per cent cleaner after just three uses			2
@entity45 : at £ 49.99 the @entity30 kit costs a fraction of cosmetic dentistry , but uses similar laser light technology for professional results unlike other home whitening kits , which rely on teeth trays and whitening strips that can be fiddly and result in uneven bleaching , @entity30 is the first ever home kit to use the same paint - on bleach and ' blue light ' technology favoured by cosmetic dentists			1
tried and tested : @entity60 , 46 , from @entity61 , said the product worked for her users simply paint the gel , which is a non-peroxide bleach , onto their teeth , before pointing a special ' light gun ' at them for two minutes			1
this heats up the gel to between @entity68 and @entity69 and speeds up the whitening process			0
manufacturers say the treatment is kinder to gums and eliminates soreness which can sometimes be experienced by users of regular home whitening products			0
they say the treatment needs to repeated 10 times for the best results			0
@entity60 , 46 , from @entity61 , @entity80 , who took part in a trial of @entity30 , said : ' i 've always wanted whiter teeth but i could never justify the price			2
' i 've tried many whitening toothpastes and systems on the market but nothing really gave me significant results			0
' but with the @entity30 kit the results are incredible			0
after 30 minutes my teeth were significantly whiter and two weeks on the results are amazing - i would recommend to anyone			2
' it is due to go on sale in larger boots stores and online later this month .			0
