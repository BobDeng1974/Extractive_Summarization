by @entity0 a family from @entity2 had to change their vacation plans after a hotel canceled their reservation because of their son 's service dog			1
golden retriever @entity10 is never far from the side of @entity14 's son , @entity13 , who has a rare form of epilepsy			1
but despite a law allowing service dogs in all facilities , the owner of @entity18 refused to have the animal on the hotel premises			1
when the attorney and mother - of - two pushed for an explanation , she was told that the @entity36 was not pet friendly			0
@entity10 is far from being a family pet however			0
the dog has been trained to alert @entity13 and his family before the 13 - year - old , who has @entity41 , suffers a seizure			1
and being right by his young owner 's side - including in restaurants and on vacations - is never usually a problem			1
' he 's been at the hospital with @entity13 when @entity13 had to have surgery			2
he was in the pre-operative room , ' ms @entity14 told @entity51			0
under the @entity54 with @entity53 , service dogs should be welcome at any place open to the public , and without prior notice			1
canceled : the @entity32 , @entity18 , told the @entity58 they could n't stay because the hotel is not pet friendly life - saver : @entity13 , who has a rare form of epilepsy , relies on service dog @entity10 to keep him safe as a courtesy , the family always calls ahead when staying in hotels to let the staff know a service dog will be traveling with them			2
ms @entity14 said that after alerting the @entity36 in @entity18 , she was told the hotel could no longer honor her booking			0
' we got an email saying due to unforeseen circumstances , they will not be able to honor our reservations , ' she said			0
a reception later told @entity51 that although she is aware of the law , the staff were unable to go against what the hotel owner had ruled			2
@entity36 's corporate office has since reached out to ms @entity14 , and offered to let her family stay at the hotel - but she declined their offer			2
' i 've already booked with another hotel that 's understanding and happy to follow the law			0
i do n't want to go to a hotel where i have to force them to follow the law , ' she said .			0

receptionist said owner 's wishes had to come before @entity53 laws
