' we just can not believe what has happened			0
' police have launched an investigation into the attack but said there appears to be no motive and it could be a case of yobs ' messing around '			0
the attack occurred just three weeks after the couple , who have no children and who met just 14 months ago , got married			0
they were writing thank you cards for the wedding gifts they had received when their home was targeted at around 11pm on april 18			2
mrs @entity63 , who works for the @entity65 charity , said : ' we were sat down writing all of the thanks you cards			2
' it was the first time we had been in the house since our wedding and it was getting late , around 11.20pm			0

mr @entity0 was taken to hospital after being hit with a brick but doctors could not save his left eye ' we did see a man outside and then there was a crash as a brick hit the window			1
the next minute we knew there was glass shattered all over the hall because a brick had hit the door			1
' @entity0 opened the door and the man was standing there shouting ' come on , come on '			1
the next minute @entity0 is covered in blood			2
' i just wish he had never opened the front door			1
i had already called 999 and for him to go out was a mistake but it obviously was a natural reaction to what was happening			0
' we do n't have any idea why it happened			0
we feel like it must have been wrong place , wrong time			0
@entity0 has never had trouble before and neither of us can understand why these people would do something as low as this			2

i do n't think either of us want to come back after what 's happened			0
we are just too scared to live in this neighbourhood			0
' detective constable @entity131 , of @entity132 , said the second brick was thrown ' directly ' at the man but would n't reveal how many offenders were involved in the incident			2
he said : ' at this stage , there appears to be no known motive for this attack			0
' it might be there is no motive other than the culprits were messing around and for whatever reason thought it would be funny to throw bricks at someone 's house			0
the attack occurred just three weeks after mr @entity0 married his partner @entity14 , who he met just 14 months ago			2
the couple are pictured on their wedding day at @entity153 in @entity154 and @entity155 , @entity156 the couple had been sat quietly in the living room of their @entity7 home writing thank you notes for the gifts they received on their wedding day - just three weeks ago ( pictured ) - when the attack occurred last friday police said the brick was thrown ' directly ' at mr @entity0 when he answered the door of his home ( pictured )			1
officers said there appeared to be no known motive for the attack and said it could be yobs ' messing around ' ' however , there is absolutely nothing funny or clever about what they did and as a result of their wanton and reckless actions , this man has been left with a permanent disability and a loss of sight in one eye			2
' understandably , he is a mixture of angry and devastated so we need to establish who was responsible for this senseless incident and bring them to justice			0
' i would therefore urge anyone who saw anything , or if you suspect who may be involved , to call us immediately			0
' anyone with information about the incident should contact police on 101 .			0
