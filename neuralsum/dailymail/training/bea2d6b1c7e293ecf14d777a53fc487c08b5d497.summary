by @entity0 an @entity2 local council has agreed in a crucial vote to retain a plaque dedicated to disgraced entertainer @entity5 - even though it 's been stolen			1
while other tributes to @entity5 have been removed around the world , the shire of @entity7 in @entity8 has voted to keep the metal commemorative plaque			1
but local taxpayers might have to fork out to pay for a replacement because the original , in once - pride - of - place on a stand in a park in @entity17 , was stolen several days ago			1
' i 'm disappointed by the decision , ' said councillor @entity31 , who put forward the motion to take down the plaque			0
' some of the councillors argued you ca n't change history , and cited the example of @entity38 being revered as a national hero and the fact his background and record was questionable , ' mr @entity31 told the @entity43			0
' but i argued that you ca n't compare standards of a hundred years ago to the standards that we now adopt and are proud of in society today			0
' mr @entity31 said he hoped a fresh vote could be held before the council had to foot the bill for a replacement			0
' i hope the council can resolve to permanently remove the plaque to save the community the expense of replacing it			0
' @entity5 was sentenced to more than five years in jail for indecently assaulting four girls between 1968 and 1986 police have investigated the theft but it is understood no progress has been made in catching the souvenir hunters			1
earlier this month another plaque dedicated to @entity5 was stolen from outside the entertainer 's former home in the @entity65 suburb of @entity66			1
the local council had voted to remove the plaque - which had already been vandalised - but before the vote could be taken the memento was stolen			2
however , the council did vote to strip @entity5 of all honours and took down his art in public buildings			2
in further acts to wipe out the memory of the convicted child molester , the @entity65 council voted to remove a commemorative plaque in the city centre while the @entity81 of @entity82 agreed not to display any of his art works			0

@entity90 shire council votes to keep *controversial* plaque
but local taxpayers may have to fork out for a replacement
