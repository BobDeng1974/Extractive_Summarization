by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 there ’s a beautiful scene in @entity4 , a film that touched my life like no other			0
in the scene , the main character @entity10 , actor @entity10 , asks @entity11 , played by the brilliant @entity12 , about his short baseball career – one inning , he did n’t get to make a play , and he never got another chance			0
@entity10 wondered how that felt			0
the @entity18 held his finger and thumb close together and replied : ‘ it was like coming this close to your dreams , and then watching them brush past you like a stranger in a crowd			2
at the time you do n’t think much of it			0
you know we just do n’t recognise the most significant moments of our lives when they ’re happening			0
back then i thought , " well there ’ll be other days			0
" i did n’t realise that was the only day			0
that dream of winning a first @entity51 title – @entity43 came close			1
and then , @entity42 slipped , and the fans had to watch that dream brush past them			1
will there be other days ? @entity43 fans seem to be putting a brave face on , showing faith in @entity59 , and after the improvements under the manager last season why should n’t they have faith ? there is a huge problem though : the best player has gone , and the second best player is a year older and ‘ broken ’ – his description not mine - after a disastrous @entity46			1
@entity59 claims @entity43 will come back ‘ stronger ’ next season			1
if they do then this guy is the new @entity72 in that he will have proved he can rebuild a side after losing a main man			0
fresh face : @entity76 trains with his new @entity43 team - mates at @entity78 right now i ca n’t see it : i rate @entity76 and @entity82 , i think had @entity83 not been suspended , @entity81 would have won the @entity84 , and @entity85 has shown enough to suggest he has a great career ahead of him			2
the talk of more players coming in is exciting for @entity43 fans			1
the only problem is – none of them are on the same planet as @entity39			2
letting it slip : @entity42 fell over against @entity94 to allow @entity95 to score at @entity96 shattered dream : @entity42 looks dejected as he sees @entity43 's title dream slip away i ’m not saying it was wrong to sell : biting opponents is not the @entity43 way			1
i just ca n’t help thinking that in the market @entity43 are trading , there is no proper replacement around			2
that slip against @entity94 , was that the most significant moment of @entity43 ’s recent history ? is that a moment most fans have failed to grasp the significance of ? that was the moment the dream brushed by , and although there is brash determination being shown by all involved at @entity96 , the reality is they have just lost their only truly world - class player , who took them above @entity121 and @entity122 , to within two points of the title , to a place where they could see the dream coming true , and then had to watch while it shattered around them			1
dream over ? @entity43 fans may realise that last season was their best chance to win the title for those @entity43 fans the dream is alive			1
for the rest of us realists , the chance of domestic greatness returning to @entity96 has evaporated			2
you do n’t realise what you had until it ’s gone			0
some @entity43 fans , historians and experts were ready to elevate @entity39 to a place among the all - time greats , some even suggested he could be the best player the club has ever had			1
you do n’t replace that kind of quality easily			0
@entity59 has a chance to show how good he really is – it ’s a fantastic opportunity for him			0
but i ca n’t help feeling the @entity43 fans ’ dreams of seeing their club return to domestic greatness just brushed past @entity96 last season , and then disappeared into the crowd			1
@entity43 set to seal double signing			2

@entity43 came within two points of winning the title last season
@entity39 has gone to @entity38 and @entity42 is a year older so they may not get as close again
@entity43 fans will believe they can win the title but in reality their dream has evaporated
