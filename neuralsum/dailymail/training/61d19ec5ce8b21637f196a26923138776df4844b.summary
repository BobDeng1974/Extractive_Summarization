by @entity0 i was at @entity2 to watch @entity4 0 - 0 @entity3 , and here is the @entity6			1
lots of expensive attacking players forgot how to score			0
blunted : strikers @entity10 ( left ) and @entity11 ( right ) were left frustrated at @entity4 @entity12			1
he has n’t won anything in @entity14 as a manager , but he ’s been gifted a golden opportunity to do something special and historic at @entity3			2
it looks to me like he was out - coached by @entity20 on monday and had no answer , and you could even argue he was out - coached by @entity23 at @entity4			1
expectations : @entity12 will be considered a failure if he ca n't win a trophy this season @entity27 : @entity28 boss @entity20 out - thought @entity12 in their midweek clash read @entity32 's report from @entity2 @entity33 has been brilliant but @entity12 has struggled to cope without the midfielder			1
the elite managers are made of stronger stuff than that			0
and when you need a goal i ’m not sure @entity41 for @entity11 was the right substitution , and indeed @entity3 did n’t score and did n’t really threaten after that substitution			2
in fact @entity4 looked more likely to win it			2
@entity45 made @entity46 look like @entity47 at one point in the second half			1
being useless , the @entity51 centre back completely misjudged a bouncing ball and realised it was about to sail over his head to send @entity55 clear on goal			0
back to your feet : @entity3 's @entity45 spent too much time on the ground at @entity2 so after feeling the slightest touch of @entity55 ’s fingertips on his back he threw himself forward to the ground , and somehow referee @entity65 bought it and blew for a free kick			1
@entity45 was booed , i suspect by his own fans as well as the @entity4 faithful			1
maybe @entity71 was frustrated with his own dreadful performance but that ’s no excuse to kick out at an opponent who ’s on the floor			2
@entity76 and @entity71 went for a ball , for some strange reason the @entity78 decided to flick a boot at the @entity81			1
he should have seen red , city are lucky he did n’t			0
another one missed by ref @entity65 , who should have stuck to drumming with @entity83			0
in pain ! @entity76 is left on the deck after receiving a kick from @entity71 distraught : the pair went up for a ball together and @entity76 was left incandescent with rage @entity4 fans were magnificent , getting behind their team , even if celebrating a home draw like they ’d won a trophy was a touch over the top			1
but that song they sing – ' on the ball , @entity3 ' - is just plain wrong			1
not giving up : a @entity4 fan sings loud and proud during the uninspiring 0 - 0 draw its opening line probably did n’t make sense when it was first penned in 1902 : ' kick off , throw in , have a little scrimmage			1
' does this only have meaning in @entity107 ? fair play to them , they sung it very loud and proud			0
unfortunately the last line ' hurrah we ’ve scored a goal ' ( i ’m not joking ) had no relevance to this game			0
the @entity4 teenager has got pace and balance , his touch is usually excellent , but his final ball – be it a shot or a cross – needs improvement			2
he can play wide and in the hole , and @entity3 really struggled to keep him quiet			2
if his rate of progression continues i expect him to be in the @entity132 picture by the time @entity134 2018 comes around , if not @entity135			2
@entity136 : @entity118 flew down the @entity4 wing on more than one occasion on saturday tempted to give it to @entity76 who has now scored just once in his 17 appearances			1
for £ 8.5m @entity4 expect more , that ’s big money for them			2
but it has to go to @entity145			2
he cost £ 22m and he looks like the kind of striker who might have the occasional brilliant game , but at @entity2 he looked lazy and languid , and not physically made for a dust - up with the @entity153 ’s centre - half beasts			2
he was a poor man ’s @entity154			0
he was taken off , unsurprisingly			0
@entity156 : @entity3 's @entity145 needs to pull up his socks and prove why they spent so much money on him @entity160 ’s contract is running out and he ’s failed to rediscover his title winning form under the new boss ; @entity164 has gone backwards ; and @entity45 – a genuine @entity12 signing – is frankly awful			1
city have one decent centre back , @entity168			0
that ’s poor squad management			0
if @entity12 wins the quadruple or a treble then he ’s a genius			0
if he wins a trophy he ’s done well in his first season			0
if he wins nothing with this @entity3 squad he ’s failed			0
@entity178 : @entity168 is the only world class centre defender that @entity3 have @entity180			1
13 - and - a - half years after first playing in the @entity153 , he slotted in straight away and looked solid at the back for @entity4 alongside @entity182			1
he was @entity183 first signing at @entity184 , and was excellent for the @entity184			0
if he continues the form he showed on his @entity4 debut then that will be a shrewd signing from @entity23 , because defensively they ’ve not been great this season			1
solid : @entity180 is back playing in @entity132 after a spell in @entity193 with @entity194 @entity23 may possibly be doing just that			1
in december 1982 , as a 24 - year - old full back at @entity197 , @entity23 was interviewed about his football philosophy			1
the subsequent article in a football magazine was titled : ' @entity201 – more success '			0
it seemed to be a philosophy he was pursuing rigidly at @entity4 , but without the success bit			0
but at @entity209 last week ( even in defeat ) @entity23 ’s side attacked and created chances			0
against @entity3 you ’d have been forgiven for thinking he would send his side out to defend			0
but with @entity215 , @entity118 and @entity55 all starting , it was more 4 - 3 - 3 than 4 - 5 - 1			1
unfortunate : @entity55 thought he had scored for @entity4 but it was ruled out for offside even when @entity55 was injured half way through the second half @entity23 resisted any temptation to sit deep , making a like - for - like substitution bringing @entity76 on			1
hopefully he wo n’t revert to negative , defensive ways because @entity4 were good to watch.now he just needs to teach his strikers to score .			0

@entity12 was out - foxed by @entity20 and now @entity23
@entity3 defender @entity45 made @entity46 looks like @entity47
@entity71 lost his head and kicked out at @entity76
there must @entity132 opportunities for @entity4 's @entity118
@entity145 has to pull up his socks or risk being an expensive failure
