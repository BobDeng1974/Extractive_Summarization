the first two - footed challenge went in from @entity1 when he claimed @entity3 ’s kickers were a refined version of @entity5			1
it was a razor - sharp comment , designed to rile the @entity8 champions and put down a marker for @entity11 referee @entity10 ahead of the second leg			2
sometimes this stuff bites you on the backside			0
@entity1 will be picking the bones out of this for days because they were beaten at their own petty game by the perseverance of this @entity3 team			1
@entity22 was dismissed for this tackle on @entity24 , leaving @entity3 without their talisman @entity27 players react as referee @entity10 pulls the red card from his pocket the crestfallen @entity31 was shown a straight red to light the touchpaper on a tetchy @entity35 tie there was a minor victory for @entity27 , with the foul count showing that @entity1 ’s team had committed 24 to the visitors ’ 17 at the end of 120 chaotic minutes here at @entity43			1
the reality is that they were beaten at their own game			1
for @entity3 to do it with 10 men in extra-time , after the ludicrous dismissal of @entity22 in the 32nd minute , is an even mightier achievement			1
the @entity3 striker pointed at his battle scars as he left the pitch , well aware that the reaction of @entity27 ’s players to the collision with @entity24 had helped @entity10 with the decision			1
‘ i spoke to him and he told me he did n’t mean it , ’ admitted @entity1			0
the pair are close from his time at @entity64			0
after surrounding @entity65 , @entity27 ’s players called for the physio and team doctor to sprint on to tend to the stricken @entity24			1
predictably , within minutes , he was back on his feet			0
it is to @entity22 ’s credit that he left the field with dignity and composure , walking towards the tunnel and ignoring the clamour from the stands for a reaction			1
‘ when the red card happened , the worst thing was the @entity27 players — i felt there were 11 babies around me , ’ admitted an understandably aggrieved @entity22			1
@entity84 engaged in some gamesmanship , attempting to get @entity86 in trouble @entity1 chats with former charge @entity84 after @entity22 's sending off as @entity89 looks on it was a brutal but fair assessment of the moment that could easily have turned this tie in @entity27 ’s favour			1
there were feuds everywhere : @entity84 versus @entity86 , @entity27 ’s substitute keeper @entity86 versus @entity3 midfielder @entity96 , @entity96 against the world			1
at every turn , someone , somewhere on the field at @entity43 was rowing with somebody			0
@entity86 could start a fight in an empty phone box , never mind an 18 - yard box , gnawing away at everyone and everything during an ill - disciplined performance up top for @entity27			1
this guy is really stewing at the minute			2
he has gone a season without scoring in the @entity112 and will have to wait until september to get going again in this competition			0
@entity84 got inside his head , jabbering away at him in their native @entity118 - @entity117 tongue in an attempt to destabilise the forward			1
@entity86 , as we know , has only mastered one language			2
the @entity27 striker should have been sent off here — several times , as it happens — for his innumerable transgressions			2
he really is an angry man			0
@entity84 feels the force of retribution from @entity86 after the pair regularly crashed at @entity43 an outraged @entity86 reacts histrionically after @entity10 waved away his penalty appeal in the same motion he could have been booked and sent off when he caught @entity133 from behind close to the touchline of the @entity135 and then appeared to accept the challenge from @entity84 to graze his forehead			1
he escaped with a yellow card			0
there was another escape , this time when he shoved over the excellent @entity142 in a fit of pique			0
quite how he survived is a story in itself			0
he lives life on the edge , claiming he had been elbowed by @entity84 in a hit - and - run job			2
it was an off - the - ball incident , retribution by the former @entity27 defender after he had collided with the pugnacious forward earlier in the first half			2
he was throwing punches a few moments later , hitting the ground repeatedly after he was denied a clear penalty when @entity157 took him out as he made his way into the area			0
these are the fine lines of @entity35 football , with every challenge , skirmish and wrangle potentially punishable with an on - the - spot sanction from these notoriously pernickity officials			0
@entity166 battles for the ball with @entity157 as the duo battle for possession at @entity43 @entity86 falls to the turf after a challenge from @entity172 during a bad - tempered affair in west @entity174 @entity1 convinced us that @entity89 had put the @entity8 champions on a diet of raw meat ahead of this second leg			2
this will eat away at him for months to come			0
‘ i need to go away and think about how this happened , ’ admitted @entity1			0
perhaps next time , he should keep both feet on the floor .			0

@entity27 were beaten at their own petty game by the perseverance of this @entity3 side
for @entity3 to prevail with 10 men , after the ridiculous dismissal of @entity22 in the 32nd minute , was an amazing achievement
there were feuds everywhere : @entity84 versus @entity86 ; @entity27 ’s substitute keeper @entity86 versus @entity3 midfielder @entity96
