a top @entity1 aide is at the center of a lawsuit filed by a government watchdog group , which claims the @entity5 hid emails it was required to hand over as part of a @entity9 lawsuit			1
on wednesday @entity10 reported that @entity11 , a former @entity1 deputy chief of staff and a member of her inner circle , had a private address on the now - infamous email server @entity1 kept at her @entity16 , @entity17 home and used exclusively while she was in office			1
one day later @entity19 , a center - right group known for blanketing @entity20 with @entity9 requests , has demanded that a federal court reopen a case it agreed to drop last year because @entity11 's emails were never properly searched			1
@entity25 , the group 's research and investigations director , told @entity10 on thursday that nine more closed cases could be reopened in light of @entity1 's email-gate scandal			1
' more strong legal action will follow			0
stay tuned , ' he added at the time the @entity11 lawsuit was wending its way through federal court , the @entity5 said in writing that it had exhaustively searched its archives and provided everything @entity19 asked for			1
but with the revelation of a separate email address , the group is demanding a second bite at the apple			0
judge @entity60 in @entity20 is expected to grant the request : @entity19 writes in its filing that the @entity5 wo n't fight it			2
state ' does not oppose reopening the case in this particular circumstance , ' the legal filing says			1
according to federal court rules , a lawsuit can be reopened due to ' fraud , ... misrepresentation , or misconduct by an opposing party			1
' in its filing , @entity19 wrote that the @entity5 ' represented to @entity19 that the records of the @entity74 had been searched			0
' @entity75 , the group 's president , said there was misconduct at the @entity5 and demanded ' immediate court action ' ' at no point did the @entity5 inform @entity19 that the secretary ’s emails and the emails of ms. @entity11 and other high level officials could not be searched , ' the court petition reads			1
' ' had @entity19 known that the @entity5 ’s search excluded secretary @entity1 ’s emails and the emails of ms. @entity11 and other high level officials , @entity19 would not have stipulated to the dismissal of this case			1
' @entity75 , the group 's president , said thursday in a statement that ' @entity1 ’s misconduct and the resulting fraud by the @entity5 disrupted and ended our federal @entity9 lawsuit about @entity11 , one of @entity1 ’s closest political associates			1
' ' @entity1 and the @entity100 administration concealed records and lied to obstruct a federal court and @entity19 from finding out about the secret emails , ' he claimed			2
' @entity104 is of the essence			0
immediate court action is imperative to retrieve , recover and secure these public records from mrs. @entity1			0
' @entity1 said durign a press conference on tuesday in @entity17 that she had deleted more than 30,000 ' personal ' emails from her ' clintonemail.com ' server after determining with no outside input that they were unrelated to her government work			0
she said nothing about other accounts on the server , including @entity11 's			2
the @entity119 puts responsibility for archiving public records on the heads of government agencies – a group that included @entity1 while she ran the @entity100 administration 's @entity5 for four years			1
' @entity1 plainly violated her own legal obligations , ' @entity19 said in a press release			0
' doing so was misconduct			0
' there 's no indication that thursday 's legal petition was a response to @entity10 's expose a day earlier			2
but the @entity5 's office of general counsel could soon have its hands full			0
the @entity136 said wednesday that it , too had sued the agency to force the release of emails and other government documents from the years @entity1 was at the helm			0
some of the @entity136 's requests and demands dated back five years			0
and the @entity5 's @entity144 found this week that it had retained just 61,000 emails , out of more than 1 billion sent by the agency 's employees , in 2011 – in the middle of @entity1 's tenure			2
motion to @entity151 uploaded by @entity152			0

@entity11 has been @entity1 's closest aide for years and is seen in @entity20 as the former secretary of state 's adopted *daughter*
@entity158 reported wednesday that @entity11 had a private address on an email server controlled by @entity1 but never *indexed* by the @entity5
@entity19 agreed to drop a @entity9 lawsuit over @entity11 's records last year after @entity164 said it had handed everything over
court rules say the suit can be reopened for ' fraud ... misrepresentation or misconduct ' ; @entity19 filed papers on thursday
@entity5 ' does not oppose reopening the case , ' according to the new legal petition , and there could be at least nine more like it
