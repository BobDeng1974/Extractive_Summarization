or , more precisely , her choice of revealing outfits			0
for the final the 42 - year - old actress wore a plunging sequined @entity11 dress			1
but as she turned to whisper something to fellow judge @entity14 the neckline slipped , exposing rather more than she might have intended to the viewers at home			2

miss @entity5 appeared comfortable in the short dress , which was both backless and had cutaway panels around the waist			1
she was joined there by @entity37 , who went for a more low - key look by teaming skin - tight leather - look leggings and a loose - fitting orange t - shirt			2
daring : the @entity44 's @entity43 judge then wore a backless , cutaway dress to the afterparty at 45 @entity27 working the cameras : the 42 - year - old star seemed happy to pose in her revealing dress in sartorial contrast , @entity51 dressed for the live show in his usual uniform of jeans , partly buttoned white shirt and black blazer			1
