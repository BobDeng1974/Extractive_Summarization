professor @entity0 co-authored a study which claimed that @entity3 immigration has boosted public finances by £ 20billion the academic who predicted that only 13,000 @entity6 would arrive in @entity7 each year was under fresh fire last night for his latest study which claimed that @entity3 immigration has boosted public finances by £ 20billion			1
ministers said the new report co-written by professor @entity0 had taken a ‘ very narrow focus ’ which ignored the physical pressure migrants place on schools , hospitals and roads			1
yesterday , the @entity19 reported how professor @entity0 and dr @entity21 , of @entity22 , had produced a report heralding the ‘ positive economic impact ’ of new arrivals from the @entity3 between 2001 and 2011			1
the academics put particular emphasis on the fact that @entity6 workers had contributed £ 5billion more in taxes than they had consumed in public services and state handouts			1
but , amid criticism of the fact the report did not include the potential future costs associated with the @entity3 migrants growing older and using more state services , critics pointed to professor @entity0 ’s past history			1
sir @entity41 , chairman of @entity42 , said : ‘ it is possible that professor @entity0 ’s enthusiasm is not entirely unrelated to the fact that he was a lead researcher on the 2003 @entity47 paper which calculated that immigration from @entity6 would be between 5,000 and 13,000 a year			1
’ in the event , more than one million workers from @entity6 arrived between 2004 and the end of 2009 – an average of around 200,000 a year			2
the study carried out by the academic for the @entity47 has been widely ridiculed by politicians as ‘ spectacularly wrong ’ and ‘ laughable ’			2
in the new report , @entity3 migrants were said to have contributed a net £ 20billion to the public finances – including £ 15billion from the so - called old @entity3 , which includes @entity59 and @entity60			1
immigration minister @entity61 said the report had taken ‘ a very narrow focus ’			1
he told the @entity19 : ‘ this is a complex topic and when it comes to @entity3 migration this report does not take proper account of the pressures uncontrolled , mass immigration – the kind we saw under the last government – places on public services and communities			1
‘ it ignores issues that matter to hardworking people , the impact on schools , on hospitals , on roads , on housing			0
it tells us nothing about how uncontrolled , mass immigration can make it harder to maintain social @entity90 report takes no account of the future costs associated with those who stay , grow old and make greater demands on our public services			1
’ @entity99 ’s migration spokesman @entity97 said the study covers ‘ only a narrow part of the @entity7 migration policy debate ’			0
professor @entity0 has defended his 2003 report predicting up to 13,000 arrivals a year from @entity6 as he made clear immigration would be much higher if , as happened , other countries decided to curb access he added : ‘ what it does n’t do is to show what wealth our own people could have generated if they were n’t subjected to wage - reducing , employment - displacing mass immigration from the @entity3			1
sir @entity41 said : ‘ if you take all @entity3 migration , including those who arrived before 2001 , you find by the end of the period they are making a negative contribution and increasingly so			2
‘ and the reason is that if you take a group of people while they ’re young fit and healthy they ’re not going to be very expensive , but if you take them over a longer period they will be			0
’ while the @entity22 focussed on new arrivals from within the @entity3 , buried inside the 51 - page report was a calculation showing that , if the time period 1995 - 2001 is considered , @entity132 migrants living in @entity7 took out more than they put in for 17 consecutive years			2
the total cost to the public finances was almost £ 118billion			1
professor @entity0 has defended his 2003 report predicting up to 13,000 arrivals a year from @entity6			1
he said it made clear immigration would be much higher if , as happened , @entity60 and other countries decided to curb access to their labour markets			0
analysis : true picture his figures do not reveal @entity6 immigrants who have arrived in the @entity7 since 2000 contributed more than £ 20billion to the @entity7 public finances between 2001 and 2008 what does the report claim ? the headline - finding of professor @entity0 and dr @entity21 , of @entity22 ’s @entity151 , is that @entity6 immigrants who have arrived in the @entity7 since 2000 contributed more than £ 20billion to the @entity7 public finances between 2001 and 20011			1
the pair are particularly keen to emphasise the fact that @entity6 workers put in 12 per cent more in taxes than they received in state services and handouts			0
were eastern @entity159 the major @entity3 contributors to the exchequer ? no. they provided only a quarter of the positive contributions – despite more than one million people coming from the former @entity164 since our borders were opened in 2004			2
some £ 15billion of the total came from the 15 members of the so - called old @entity3			2
it includes the vast sums contributed by bankers , engineers and it experts from countries such as @entity59 , @entity60 and @entity176			0
in practical terms , what does it all mean ? @entity42 says the £ 20billion figure is the equivalent of a positive contribution of less than £ 1 a week per head of the total @entity7 population			0
for @entity6 workers , this figure falls to around 20p a week			0
the crucial question is : is this a price worth paying for the fact that , since 2000 , more than a million @entity3 migrants have been added to the population – placing significant strain on the country ’s social fabric			1
does report assess impact of migration from outside the @entity3 ? yes – and it makes for far less positive reading			2
between 1995 and 2011 , @entity132 migrants living in the @entity7 cost the public finances almost £ 118billion – taking out more in services and benefits than they paid in taxes for 17 consecutive years			1
during the same period , @entity3 migrants made a net contribution of £ 4.425billion			1
@entity7 natives were a net drain on the nation ’s finances of £ 541billion – reflecting the fact the country has been running a significant deficit in recent years			2
why such a gap between @entity3 and @entity214 migrant contributions ? many of the @entity132 migrants arrived during previous waves of immigration			2
they now have families and are making significant demands on schools , hospitals and the welfare state			0
the @entity6 migrants , by contrast , are typically young and single			0
@entity3 migrants also have far higher employment rates			1
for example , 81.2 per cent of @entity227 are in work compared to 46 per cent of those from @entity231			0
does the report measure the financial cost of the strain on @entity7 ’s public services ? calculations have been made to establish how much migrants cost in terms of government funds , such as medical expenses , schooling their children and the welfare state			1
the total was then deducted from their overall contribution to the public purse , including income tax , @entity248 , @entity249 , council tax and business rates			0
so what are the key omissions ? first , the scope of the report is too narrow – focussing on the cost of using public services but not the physical pressure put on roads , schools and hospitals by having to cope with so many new arrivals			1
also , the report only looks backwards			0
it examines the taxes paid by the influx of @entity6 when they are young , single and healthy but does not estimate the financial impact of them growing older and having families , putting a greater strain on the @entity272 and possibly claiming a state pension			0
is there any acknowledgement of this fact in the report ? tucked away on p37 , there is a paragraph which states that ‘ ageing of the immigrant population that arrived since 2000 may lead in the longer run to an increase in benefit receipt ’			0
however , the authors assert this will be offset by the fact some migrants will return home , while others are yet to achieve their full economic potential			0
what about the impact of mass immigration on @entity7 workers ? the study makes no attempt to measure this			0
the independent @entity300 warned earlier this year that cheap foreign labour has forced down the wages of some @entity7 workers			0
one study of pay in @entity306 had found the 20 per cent lowest paid had seen wages fall by 15 per cent on average			0
driving down the wage of natives pushes up the overall welfare bill since they are likely to be paid more in tax credits and other handouts to compensate			0
and the effect on @entity7 school - leavers ? the report makes great play of the fact that immigrants have ‘ endowed the @entity7 labour market with human capital that would have cost about £ 49billion if it were produced through the @entity7 education system ’			2
however , as @entity325 of the @entity327 think - tank points out , the arrival of well - educated young migrants coincided with a slump in apprenticeships for @entity7 teenagers – at great social cost			0
in 2012 , the @entity300 estimated that , for every four migrant workers who come to the country from outside the @entity3 , one @entity7 job is lost , again increasing the welfare bill .			2

report claims @entity3 immigration has boosted public finances by £ 20bn
same academic also predicted 13,000 eastern @entity3 migrants a year
