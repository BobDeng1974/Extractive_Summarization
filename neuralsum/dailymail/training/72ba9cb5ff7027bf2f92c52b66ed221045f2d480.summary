by @entity1 reporter published : 13:00 est , 30 may 2013 updated : 13:44 est , 31 may 2013 scientists have discovered pebbles on @entity5 , showing that a stream has flowed on the planet - and giving more weight to the theory that it was once able to support life			1
the rounded pebbles found by the team from @entity14 's curiosity rover mission , and published in journal @entity16 today , are only formed when they are carried through water over long distances , according to the researchers			1
it is the first time that evidence of sustained water flows on @entity5 has been uncovered			1
the individual stones in the area are rounded like pebbles on @entity27 shores and were probably transported down through a ravine , @entity29 , which is carved in the southern slope of the northern crater wall the images are taken by the spectroscopic stereo camera , @entity34 , at an angle from a vantage point two meter above the @entity5 ground and therefore gives a slightly distorted image of the size of the stones depending on their location in the image field			1
the further away you look , the greater the distortion of the size of the stones in the image			0
the @entity27 researchers from the @entity48 , together with a @entity50 collaborator and the camera team built a system that can rectify the image so that sizes are directly comparable			0
@entity54 , a geologist at @entity55 , said the discovery of the pebbles - which were laid down more than two billion years ago - was due to choosing the right place for curiosity to land			2
she said : ' the main reason we chose @entity63 as a landing site was to look at the layered rocks at the base of @entity67 , about five miles away			0
' we knew there was an alluvial fan in the landing area , a cone - shaped deposit of sediment that requires flowing water to form			2
' these sorts of pebbles are likely because of that environment			0
so while we did n't choose @entity63 for this purpose , we were hoping to find something like this			0
' the report authors noted that conditions on @entity5 at the time the pebbles were deposited were vastly different to the cold , dry environment of the present day if water was to flow over several kilometres			1
they added : ' these ancient fluvial deposits indicate sustained liquid water flows across the landscape - a finding that raises prospects for the former presence of habitable environments on @entity5			1
more work needs to be carried out into the risks of radiation to astronauts wanting to take a closer look at the geography of the red planet ahead of any future missions to @entity5 however , according to a separate study published in @entity16 today			1
the study area , which has been named ' @entity103 ' , is by all accounts the remains of sediments from the bottom of an ancient stream , which had a relatively strong current a radiation assessment detector ( @entity111 ) on board curiosity during its 253 - day journey to @entity5 made measurements of the environment inside the spacecraft , and its results could have important implications for manned missions			1
@entity120 of the @entity121 in @entity122 , @entity123 , said astronauts would be subject to a high dose of radiation - representing a large fraction of the amount that is acceptable over a lifetime			0
he said : ' in terms of accumulated dose , it 's like getting a whole - body ct scan once every five or six days			0
understanding the radiation environment inside a spacecraft carrying humans to @entity5 or other deep space destinations is critical for planning future crewed missions			1
' based on @entity111 measurements , unless propulsion systems advance rapidly , a large share of mission radiation exposure will be during outbound and return travel , when the spacecraft and its inhabitants will be exposed to the radiation environment in interplanetary space , shielded only by the spacecraft itself			0
' the report looked at the exposure to galactic cosmic rays and solar energetic particles that the spaceship experienced during the journey to @entity5			2
multiple outcroppings of rocks like this one ( termed a pebble conglomerate ) were observed along the first 275 meters traversed by the rover with the high - resolution @entity34 dr @entity120 said a spacecraft carrying astronauts would have protection against solar particles , but that cosmic rays are much more difficult to stop			0
the next step will be to investigate radiation while on the surface of the planet itself , said dr @entity120 , who added this was critical in light of some of the proposed scenarios for @entity5 missions which envisaged astronauts spending up to 500 days on @entity5			2
' this issue will have to be addressed , one way or another , before humans can go into deep space for months or years at a time , ' he said .			0
