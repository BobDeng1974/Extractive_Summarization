with just 16 more sleeps until the @entity2 season kicks off , excitement is building as we eagerly await the new campaign			0
for now , we make do with the warm - up matches , offering glimpses of what we can expect to see in just over two weeks time			0
some stars are already shining bright , scoring goals and frightening defences			0
apologies in advance if it is all a deception , but here are the five players that @entity17 expect to take the @entity2 by storm this time around			0
in truth , these positions do not do justice to an @entity39 centre half of giant potential			0
sir @entity41 bought him as a centre - back and intended to mould him in that position			0
as it transpired , three seasons on , @entity27 has started only 16 times at the heart of the @entity28 defence			2
under @entity51 's new 3 - 5 - 2 system , @entity27 is assured a place as part of the back three and now faces a major test of his credential			0
so far , so good though - @entity28 have not conceded in pre-season when @entity27 has been on the pitch			1
rock solid : @entity28 are yet to concede a goal in pre-season with @entity27 ( left ) on the pitch @entity62 ( @entity63 ) the marquee signing to replace @entity65 , considered one of the finest young talents in the world game , but he endured a traumatic first campaign with @entity63			1
@entity62 's only 90 mutes in the @entity2 came in the 6 - 0 thrashing by @entity72 at the @entity73 and he did not appear in a @entity63 shirt following the turn of the year			2
the @entity76 , who struggled with injuries in the second half of the season , is desperate to turn things round and prove himself in the @entity2			0
he scored twice in the victory over @entity85 and manager @entity86 has been speaking positively of @entity62 's attitude and quality - but they will both know that sterner tests await upon their return to @entity92			1
finding his feet : @entity63 forward @entity62 has shone glimpses of his ability during @entity63 ' @entity97 tour @entity98 v @entity63 highlights @entity100 ( @entity101 ) one of the few @entity92 players to emerge from the @entity103 with their reputation enhanced , @entity100 has picked up from where he left off last season			1
a goal against @entity72 capped a fine performance and with @entity110 gone and @entity101 looking a touch light in the forward positions , there is an opportunity for @entity100 to emerge as @entity101 's talisman , dribbling with confidence , committing opponents and taking responsibility			1
if he remains fit , he could double last season 's return of 10 goals			0
danger man : @entity101 's @entity100 slots the ball beyond @entity72 keeper @entity123 @entity98 @entity101 v @entity72 highlights @entity124 ( @entity72 ) four goals in two games against @entity127 and @entity101 in the @entity97 is almost as many as the six that @entity124 managed in the whole of last season			1
clearly , @entity124 is a man on a mission , determined to revive his @entity72 career after a first season punctuated by muscle injuries and frequent setbacks , as the @entity135 started only two @entity2 games			1
in his previous life in @entity138 , he was compared to @entity139 and @entity140 , and it is telling that @entity142 , despite his frustrations with @entity124 last season , would not countenance selling him to @entity144 this summer			2
city believe they have one of the planet 's most inventive forwards on their hands and with @entity150 injured , he will be handed the chance to battle with @entity152 for a place alongside the brilliant @entity154			0
goal - getter : @entity124 flicks the ball past @entity157 to score for @entity72 @entity22 ( @entity21 ) the brawny frontman has made an instant impact in a @entity21 shirt , opening his account against @entity162 and then laying on assists for @entity164 and @entity165 in the victory over @entity167 on wednesday evening			1
thirty - five goals for @entity177 last season and @entity22 looks set to shatter the narrative of the @entity179 years , where big name strikers such as @entity169 , @entity170 , @entity171 and @entity172 have all failed to shine in the blue shirt			2
perfect start : @entity22 netted his first goal for @entity21 in their 2 - 1 win against @entity183			1

@entity100 scored in *normal* time as @entity101 beat @entity72 on *penalties* in @entity187
spurs forward @entity62 netted twice against @entity85 and looks to be finding his form ahead of the new season
@entity28 are yet to concede with @entity27 on the pitch
@entity124 already has four goals in two games during pre-season
@entity22 scored on his debut for @entity21 and also has two assists
