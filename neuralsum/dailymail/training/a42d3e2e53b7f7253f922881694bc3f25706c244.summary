by @entity1 reporter published : 11:59 est , 27 november 2012 updated : 11:59 est , 27 november 2012 @entity3 's lemmings were killed off five times during the last @entity5 because of their inability to deal with rapid climate change , say scientists			1
other small mammal species may have met a similar fate , experts believe			2
the finding casts further doubt on claims that humans were largely to blame for the disappearance of large @entity5 animals such as the woolly mammoth , giant deer and cave bear			1
regional extinctions : research has shown that @entity3 's lemmings , like this @entity24 lemming pictured in @entity25 , were killed off five times during the last @entity5 because of fluctuations in temperature it suggests that a series of short - lived warm periods led to inhospitable environments for many cold - adapted animals , leading to the collapse of local ecosystems			1
scientists analysed dna from caves in @entity38 and the @entity39 to track the evolution of the collared lemming over a period of 50,000 years			2
previously experts thought the lemming , and other small mammals , only vanished from more southern regions when the climate began to warm around 10,000 years ago			1
scientists have found that the ' greening ' of the @entity51 many not be solely caused by global warming , as previously believed , but the environmental impact of lemmings , whose presence causes lichens to be replaced by grasses and sedge			2
scientists still do not know what the net effects of this greening might be on climate			2
they fear greenhouse gas being released by bacteria responsible for plant decomposition			1
but , on the other hand , the plants act as important ' sink ' soaking carbon up from the atmosphere			0
a @entity73 study last year found that when lemmings are absent , the @entity51 tundra is likely to be more barren and covered in lichens and moss			0
but where lemmings live there is a surprising increase in grass and sedge			0
one reason for the trend may be the waste products of large numbers of lemmings fertilising the soil , say the researchers			0
' by focusing on a small mammal , we could remove the possibility that humans were having any significant impact on their population size - lemmings are just too numerous and prolific , ' said lead researcher dr @entity97 , from @entity98			1
' so any changes in the population had to be linked to wider environmental changes			0
' colleague dr @entity102 , also from @entity98 , said : ' while lemmings have an undeserved reputation for leaping off cliffs , in reality they are critical prey species for many arctic animals , and removing them from the ecosystem would have massive knock - on effects for predators			0
' scientists have known for a long time that the @entity114 led to diversification and speciation in many animals			0
however , the new study , published in the journal @entity120 , is one of the first to demonstrate that climatic change during the last @entity5 was an important driver of extinction			1
during this period , lemmings in western @entity3 were wiped out five times			0
each extinction was followed by a recolonisation of genetically different lemmings			0
' that the lemmings in western @entity3 became extinct five times during the last @entity5 is unparalleled among mammals , ' said co-author @entity132 , from the @entity133			1
' we were really surprised by this finding			2

finding casts doubt on whether humans were responsible for extinctions of larger @entity5 mammals like mammoths and cave bears
