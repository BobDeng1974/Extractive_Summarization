it 's a delicacy usually consumed in small portions			0
but @entity2 is such a fan of sushi he is able to eat 50 portions in one sitting			1
high in protein and carbohydrates , the fish - based diet has helped the @entity11 number one build up an imposing 6ft 3in , 13½ stone frame			1
without the extra rations the @entity14 ’s punishing schedule would see him lose around 8kg of muscle in a year			0
more than a mouthful : @entity2 seeks out sushi wherever he play and can put away an incredible 50 portions in a single sitting he needs to eat within an hour of the end of a match and makes sure his team has tracked down a high - quality sushi restaurant wherever he plays			1
at @entity25 he has been known to put sushi in an ice cooler so he can have it brought to him at the end of a late game			1
@entity2 puts away an astonishing 6,000 calories a day washed down with at least six litres of water he also eats large quantities of red meat , pasta and rice spread over six meals in a day			1
breakfast is a yoghurt and a peanut butter bagel with a protein shake			0
the 6,000 calories a day are washed down with at least six litres of water			0
alcohol , processed foods and sugar are avoided at all costs			0
the energy - rich meals are burned off throughout the day during his tennis sessions , hot @entity53 yoga , stretches and weight training			1
@entity56 , who has coached top @entity11 players , says : ‘ @entity2 is such a physical player that every time he slams down his foot he is basically ripping his body to shreds			1
he then needs to replenish the lost protein because that ’s a big element of rebuilding			0
players like sushi because it tastes fresh and is not fried			2
‘ there ’s something called a glycaemic window			0
the body needs the carbohydrates and protein to replenish the muscles and the liver with glycogen			0
the rice helps that process			0
’ the @entity78 has recommended sushi for all its athletes in the past and tennis ace @entity82 and baseball star @entity83 are fans			2

the omega - 3 fatty acids in fish are linked to heart protection and improved circulation and rice is a good source of protein			1

but despite its healthy reputation , the @entity89 food came under attack recently from those who say it is worse than a @entity114 takeaway			0
critics say many sushi rolls contain very little fish and are laced with fatty mayonnaise – not to mention filled with processed carbohydrates			1
@entity120 , which often accompanies a sushi lunch , contains high salt levels – as does otherwise healthy miso soup .			2
