by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter published : 10:02 est , 29 august 2013 updated : 10:09 est , 29 august 2013 giant lumps of lard and baby wipes have been discovered clogging @entity7 sewers			1
the ' fatbergs ' , described as clumps of festering food mixed with wet wipes and cooking oil , have been found blocking more than a thousand miles of pipe under the streets of @entity7 , @entity15			1
sewage workers have been forced to crawl 50 feet into the main pumping station 's narrow tunnels to pull out the baby wipes by hand			1
but the fastest growing environmental concern is disposable wet wipes which do n't dissolve and clog the pumping station			1
at least once a month , workers have to climb 30 to 50 feet down a narrow tunnel to reach the pumps and clean out the wet wipes			1
' new mothers are dumping more into our system			0
the elderly senior homes are using them more and they ’re just flushing them down the toilet and that ’s causing a lot of problems , ' he said			0
' those wipes they get into our wells and they clog together , and it ’s too much for our pump system			0
we have to physically go down there and collect all the wipes and bring them up and get rid of them through the trash system			0
' @entity35 told @entity38 31 sewage workers found a giant grease bubble in pipes underneath the home of one resident who complained his drains were backing up			1
workers discovered the @entity25 , @entity7 , resident had been regularly pouring grease down his sink , causing it to harden in a lump in the sewer and block the line			1
so much grease had oozed into the main , workers had to clean it several times			0
@entity7 's festering fat chunks are reminiscent of ' @entity92 ' , a disgusting 15 tonne blockage discovered in pipes under @entity95 in south @entity96 earlier this month			1
the blockage was so critical it threatened to blast untreated sewage through manhole covers onto the streets of one of the leafiest @entity96 boroughs			2
engineers who found the colossal blockage of congealed fat said they had never seen anything like it			0
@entity108 , waste contracts supervisor for @entity110 said : ' we 've never seen a single , congealed lump of lard this big clogging our sewers before			2
' given we 've got the biggest sewers and this is the biggest fatberg we 've encountered , we reckon it has to be the biggest such ' berg ' in @entity121 history			0
screen grab from @entity124 footage of a giant ' fatberg ' discovered in a sewer under the streets of @entity95 in south @entity96			2
it was described as the size of a double decker bus rivers of filth : if workers had n't cleared the mass , raw sewage could have spurted out of manholes across the whole of @entity95 ' the sewer was almost completely clogged with over 15 tonnes of fat			1
' if we had n't discovered it in time , raw sewage could have started spurting out of manholes across the whole of @entity95			2
' the blockage was discovered after residents in nearby flats complained they could n't flush their toilets and repairs could take six weeks to complete			0
workmen used a high - pressure jet of water to blast away the massive blockage over 10 nights			0
mr @entity108 said homes and businesses need to change their ways , and when it comes to fat and wipes people need to ' bin it , not block it ' .			0
