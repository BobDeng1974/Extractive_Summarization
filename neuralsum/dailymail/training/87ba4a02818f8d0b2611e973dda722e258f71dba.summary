the bullet which lodged in a police officer ’s radio in the gunfight which led to @entity5 being shot dead was police issue ammunition , it was reported last night			1
the revelation will fuel the fury in @entity10 about the killing of the father of four by armed officers			2
the bullet which was found lodged in the radio of one of the officers at the scene is still undergoing forensic tests			1
it was initially suggested by the @entity20 ( @entity20 ) that @entity22 officers returned fire after someone in the minicab opened fire			2
but sources have said the first ballistics examinations suggested it was police issue			1
shot dead : the death of father - of - four @entity5 sparked the initial riots in @entity10 and rumours spreading ' like wildfire ' on the internet are thought to have fuelled further unrest in other parts of the capital what a waste : an historic department store that survived the blitz is ravaged by flames during the riots as firefighters can only look on and watch these are very distinct as the @entity22 uses hollowed - out bullets designed not to pass through an object			1
the news has undermined suggestions that there was an exchange of fire between mr @entity54 and the police before he died			1
yesterday the @entity20 was forced to deny reports that mr @entity54 was ‘ assassinated ’ as rumours spread like wildfire on the internet that he was unarmed , having put his gun down on the ground when he was shot			1
mr @entity54 ’s brother ’s @entity63 said he would never have shot at police , saying it was ‘ utter rubbish ’			1
‘ my brother ’s not that sort of person , ’ he said			2
‘ he ’s not stupid to shoot at the police , that ’s ridiculous			1
’ should @entity72 cut short his holiday to deal with the riots and economy ? should @entity72 cut short his holiday to deal with the riots and economy ? now share your opinion mr @entity63 said he did not condone the rioting			2
‘ i know people are frustrated , they ’re angry out there at the moment , but i would say please try and hold it down			2
please do n’t make this about my brother ’s life , he was a good man			2
‘ we ’re all devastated about the mishap , we do n’t actually know what has actually happened			2
‘ nobody ’s actually come forward and told us , “ this is what has taken place ”			0
whether we believe what they ’re saying or whether we do n’t , there should be somebody here putting my parents ’ minds at rest about whatever ’s going on			0
’ his grieving mother @entity106 was still wearing her dressing gown at midday when she came to the door of her semi in @entity10 and said : ‘ i ca n’t sleep , i ca n’t think			0
we are all in too much of a state to say anything			0
’ looted : this electronics shop in @entity10 was entirely stripped out as looting was encouraged via @entity113 shattered : every pane of glass is broken in a @entity117 mobile phone shop - and all the phones inside taken wrecked : this shop looks as if a bomb had hit it , as rioters took anything they could mr @entity54 ’s fiancee @entity124 said : ‘ the rioting was n’t planned			1
it ’s a reaction of angry people that just wanted justice for @entity130			0
‘ it ’s sad what happened but all we wanted were answers and we did n’t get any			0
‘ because we did n’t get any answers , this is the result			0
‘ there is no way the family wanted this trouble , innocent people being hurt			0
it is silly and it just got so out of control			0
’ yesterday @entity113 was flooded with posts speculating about a police ‘ execution ’ , while others said mr @entity54 was targeted because he was known to be a crack dealer and linked to the area ’s many gangs , including the ‘ @entity151 ’ based around the @entity153 estate			1
confrontation : masked vandals were met by police in riot gear throughout the night shells : buildings in the area stood destroyed yesterday morning as a result of the riots these pictures capture the brutal aftermath of the riots , with windows smashed and debris strewn around the streets burnt - out : whole blocks of houses have been destroyed , and continued smouldering throughout sunday one tweet compared his death to that of @entity174 and the singer @entity175 , who is said to have stabbed himself to death when officers arrived to question him over drugs offences			1
it read : ‘ the police said @entity5 had a gun			1
@entity185 died of natural causes			0
’ but @entity20 commissioner @entity187 denied the reports of an execution			0
she said : ‘ the investigation into the circumstances of @entity5 ’s death must remain my priority			2
‘ it is important however that i address some of the misinformation circling around – much of which is unhelpful , and some of which is inflammatory			0
' speculation that @entity5 was “ assassinated ” in an execution style involving a number of shots to the head are categorically untrue			0
‘ following the formal identification of the body mr @entity54 ’s family know that this is not the case and i would ask anyone reporting this to be aware of its inaccuracy and its inflammatory nature			1
‘ the @entity20 is investigating not only the actions of the officer firing the shots but also the planning , decision making and implementation of the police operation			1
‘ our lines of inquiry include the bullets fired and any firearms used and recovered			0
’ she added : ‘ i know there are concerns that we have not provided enough support to the family in the first days – and i am very sorry if anyone should feel that			0

bullet lodged in officer *'s* radio was ' police issue ammunition '
casts doubt on claims of a shoot out with police before death
@entity54 was a ' crack dealer ' linked to string of *feared* gangs
