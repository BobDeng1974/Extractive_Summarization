the @entity5 awarded a contract earlier this year as it tries to find up to 170,000 immigrants who have gone missing			1
services company @entity8 , who won the bid , will be paid according to how many are discovered			1
the cases will then be handed over to immigration officers who will try to remove them from the country			2
backlog : the @entity15 is hunting up to 170,000 missing immigrants border chiefs are struggling to deal with the backlog of cases in the @entity20 , which is made up of migrants whose appeals to extend their work or student visas were turned down			1
they should have then left the country but in many cases officials had no idea whether they had left the country or were still here illegally			0
in around 40 per cent of cases officials had not even sent out the letter telling them to go back home			0
@entity5 chief executive @entity35 revealed the existence of the contract yesterday before the @entity38			1
he told @entity39 that a trial scheme operated by another company , @entity41 , found one in five of those contacted left the country within six months			0
mr @entity35 said : ‘ the contract is a payment by results , where they will make contact with potential over stayers from our records			1
‘ the potential value of the contract , if they performed very well over a four - year period , would be around £ 40 million			1
’ he added : ‘ @entity8 will be paid for the number of people who they make contact with and leave			2
‘ if nobody leaves , because they make contact with them , nobody will get paid			2

@entity76 , chief inspector of border and immigration , discovered it during a routine inspection			2

critics said the emergence of the new backlog raised concerns about the credibility of the immigration system			0
in some cases , when migrants had refused to leave , their details were not placed on the @entity94			0
this means if they were arrested officers would have no idea they were wanted by the immigration authorities .			0
