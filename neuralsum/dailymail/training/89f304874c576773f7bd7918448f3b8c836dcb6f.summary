published : 15:50 est , 22 april 2014 updated : 16:50 est , 22 april 2014 it started out as delicate - and as small - as a tiny china teacup			1
but there is nothing delicate about this rampant houseplant now - after it has enjoyed a fantastic growth spurt every year for half a decade			1
@entity6 was given this red @entity7 - an @entity9 species of plant - as a present seven years ago			1
huge : @entity6 was shocked when her pot - plant shot up and began produced oversized blooms before : the plant started out being tiny enough to keep in a tea - cup , and would have been even smaller than this specimen ( file photo ) and for the first two , its blooms remained decidedly manageable as the houseplant unobtrusively stayed in its diminutive terracotta home			1
but five years ago the plant began enjoying phenomenal growth - and has to be contained by a huge plastic bucket after it shot up to be almost five feet tall			1
huge : the blooms , which last for around three weeks , are astonishingly large ms @entity6 , from @entity26 in @entity27 , was astonished by the progress her pot plant has made - especially as she confesses to being far from green - fingered			2
she said : ' i 'm not terribly good with plants , and i did n't expect anything really to come of it			0
' for a while it just seemed to be fine , then suddenly , over the last five years or so , it has grown almost a foot every year			2
' the bright red blooms it produces are bigger than my head			0
it reminds me of a triffid - the blooms are just massive			0
' @entity7 are a species native to @entity44 and @entity45			2
they are a popular houseplant which are - in general - easy to maintain			0
according to the @entity49 , if cared for correctly the plants will burst into colour right in the very depths of winter			0
however , the plants are slow to grow , and often take several years to lay their roots before they are capable of springing up as ms @entity6 's specimen appears to have done			0
it is not unusual for a @entity7 to reach heights of two or three feet once fully mature .			1

@entity58 received plant seven years ago - and it hardly grew
but two years later the flower - a @entity7 - started to get growth spurts
the plant grew *steadily* every year - and is now almost five feet tall
