polling by @entity11 showed @entity24 's lead was larger among women , according to a survey of 8,053 people in november 2013 the findings emerged in a survey of more than 8,000 voters , which revealed widespread public disillusion with @entity65 ’s politicians			0

by contrast , @entity24 was backed by 37 per cent of men and 41 per cent of women			2
but lord @entity11 said : ‘ the @entity12 ’s problem is not that it is attracting enough women – it is not attracting enough of anybody			0
pollster lord @entity11 said the polls show the @entity79 do not have a problem with women , but with all voters ‘ the striking thing in the polls is not the gender gap , but the overall numbers of either sex who are prepared to say the @entity79 stand for opportunity or are on their side			0
‘ it is not women who have a problem with the @entity12 , it is voters			0
’ number 10 is highly sensitive to accusations that either the government or the prime minister himself are anti-women			1
mr @entity4 was accused of sexism after telling @entity24 frontbencher @entity99 to ‘ calm down , dear ’ in the @entity100			2
some analysts have also warned that the @entity103 ’s austerity drive hits women disproportionately			0

the @entity79 scored most highly for being ‘ willing to take tough decisions for the long term ’ and because they were ‘ competent and capable ’			0
@entity24 scored highest for wanting to ‘ help ordinary people get on in life ’ and for being ‘ on the side of people like me ’			0
