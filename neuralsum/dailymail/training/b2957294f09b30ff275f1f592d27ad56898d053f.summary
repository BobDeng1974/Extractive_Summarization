it has not escaped @entity2 ’s notice that the last time a golfer won the @entity5 award was the year he was born			1
just like the 25 - year - old @entity8 this season , sir @entity6 won four times in 1989			1
just like @entity2 , two of those successes were the @entity12 and the @entity14 ’s flagship event , the @entity15 at @entity16			1
@entity6 ’s other two wins however , in the @entity17 and the @entity18 , were events far below the standing of the pair rounding out @entity2 ’s illustrious quartet — the @entity24 and the @entity25			1
is this the year , therefore , when the sport ’s long wait finally ends ? in @entity31 , at the @entity28 where the @entity30 gala concert was held in september , are we about to see just the third golfer crowned ( the other was @entity36 @entity35 in 1957 , when he captained @entity37 and @entity38 to a rare @entity30 success ) in the 61st edition of the @entity5 ’s prestigious sports review ? @entity2 beams in the locker room at @entity43 following his triumph in @entity12 ‘ it would be big for golf , would n’t it ? ’ said @entity2			1
‘ growing up in a sports - mad household , it was certainly a programme i always watched			2
it was a chance to see some of the greats of @entity52 sport being honoured			2
so i ’m really pleased to be part of the conversation			2
‘ i think when you look at the names of the winners it ’s understandable why it has been a while since a golfer has won			1
we ’ve had great footballers like @entity61 and @entity62 , we ’ve had the cyclists , the @entity64 in 2012 and @entity65 winning @entity66			1
‘ having said that , this would be a great time for a golfer to win			1
if the wider public see a golfer doing his stuff on a programme like this , it might spark a greater interest			1
‘ of course , there will always be interest in golf			2
but it might give it an injection of excitement , like it had in the mid- 90s with @entity6 and @entity85 , or when @entity87 came along			1
that would be great from a @entity52 and @entity89 perspective			2
’ @entity2 owes much to his dedicated father @entity90 , who along with mother @entity91 , made many sacrifices at a time when there has been a significant drop in participation levels and the game is rarely shown on terrestrial television , @entity2 is the sort of poster boy a sport dreams about			1
his father @entity90 worked behind the bar at @entity104 in @entity105 , while his mother @entity91 took on menial jobs to give @entity2 his chance			1
sport is full of inspirational stories and the fact @entity2 , from these humble circumstances , grew up to become comfortably the best golfer in the world in 2014 is right up there with the best of them			1
‘ i realise there are a lot of great candidates but if i do win , i ’m hoping it will be an inspiration for young kids to pick up a set of clubs and go and play , ’ he said			1
‘ i know all about the numbers playing golf going down and it ’s important we attract more young people			2
’ as ever with @entity2 , the season has been long and eventful			1
off the course he broke off his engagement with fiancee @entity133			2
he has been embroiled in a nasty legal battle with his former management company that will lead to a slew of headlines that will make the front sections of newspapers , as well as the back , when it reaches its bitter conclusion in a @entity144 courtroom in february			2
in past years , such distractions clearly affected his golf but this season he has done an amazing job of putting it all to one side			2
@entity133 and @entity2 ended their engagement in may during a turbulent year for the world no 1 ‘ i guess i ’ve just got used to it , ’ he said , with a rueful grin			1
‘ i think over the years i ’ve just learned to compartmentalise			0
in 2013 i did n’t have the best off - season and perhaps did n’t put in the work i should have			0
‘ but this year i really re-dedicated myself in some ways			0
i got back to what worked before , and the results came afterwards			0
’ the high - point , of course , was that four - week stretch from mid-july to mid-august , when he won three tournaments in a row comprising two majors and a @entity25			2
@entity166 might have been exaggerating a bit to call it the finest stretch of golf ever played but it was certainly the finest by any player born in @entity172			0
‘ i might have played better tournaments but i ’ve definitely never had a stretch like that before , ’ acknowledged @entity2			1
‘ winning @entity12 obviously meant an awful lot , as it does to any player born in the @entity52			1
it ’s on the @entity5 , it ’s watched by a lot of people who do n’t normally follow golf , and it was noticeable to me how much my recognition levels went up			1
a jubilant @entity2 celebrates a dominant @entity30 win alongside @entity185 and @entity186 @entity5 : live on sunday on @entity5 from 8pm and @entity187 from 7.30pm			1
‘ the second one , the @entity189 , i played really well			0
the @entity191 course is one i love so it was great to win there and get back to world no 1 , which was certainly one of my goals			1
‘ as for the @entity198 , that might have been the one i enjoyed the most , for the way it panned out			0
i ’m really proud of the way i played down the stretch to catch @entity203 , @entity166 and @entity204 , with the light fading and all that			0
‘ so yeah , it was the time of my professional life so far , and it ’s obviously nice when people like @entity166 are saying such things			0
but you ca n’t afford to dwell too long on what you ’ve done in this game			0
‘ the wins are on the board but i ’m already thinking ahead to 2015 and trying to win more tournaments			2
’ @entity2 catches the @entity24 from @entity198 president @entity216 after victory at @entity218 what a year it promises to be			1
not only will he get to defend two majors ; at the masters in april he will have his first tilt at becoming just the sixth golfer to complete the career grand slam , and all at such a tender age			1
‘ there ’s going to be a bit of hype around that week , is n’t there ? ’ he said , smiling			0
‘ that ’s fine with me			0
i ’ve reached the stage where i ’m happy to embrace it			0
but do you know what i ’m looking forward to the most in the build - up ? just trying to improve certain areas of my game			0
‘ yes , i want to win the masters			2
but what will help me do that ? what ’s held me back from winning it before ? how can i change the outcome ? they ’re the things i ’m concentrating on			0
‘ i ’m not saying to myself i want to win the masters because anyone can do that			2
it ’s how you go about it that enables you to achieve such goals			0
’ @entity2 says interest in golf has wavered since @entity87 ' decline , but he wishes to improve its popularity for this festive month , however , the masters can wait			1
time for a bit of relaxation back home in @entity105			0
time to keep the gossip photographers busy , no doubt			0
time for too many @entity262 dinners and one or two @entity264 rugby games			0
the odd trip to @entity266 , perhaps			0
and a big night out in @entity31			0
‘ i ’m looking forward to it , ’ he said			0
‘ it ’s been a heck of a year for golf and it could be some night for the game			0
we ’ve got a decent shout for @entity276 with the @entity30 boys , while i think everyone agrees @entity279 was a brilliant captain , so he must have a chance for @entity281			0
‘ and obviously you ’ve got me in there as well			0
hopefully it ’s a night we dominate			0
’ @entity285 ( @entity287 correspondent ) given that he does not possess a set of go - faster golf clubs , it has to be @entity2			1
@entity291 may be a great driver but he does not compete on even terms with most of his rivals			2
@entity2 has no false advantages and is up against a much wider global talent pool			1
vote for : @entity2 @entity296 ( @entity297 writer ) @entity291 should have won it in 2008 after clinching the @entity297 title , but was beaten by sir @entity300			1
i fancy @entity2 will get the better of him this year , too			1
@entity291 deserves it as a winner of 11 races this year under huge pressure			0
@entity306 was the last winner for @entity297 — 18 years ago			0
vote for : @entity291 @entity308 ( @entity309 ) @entity2 should get it because he competes on a level playing field with his competitors			1
motor racing is a pastime dictated largely by engineering			0
it ’s hard to call it sport when only two or three contestants can possibly win			2
vote for : @entity2 @entity319 ( @entity321 correspondent ) it ’s got to be @entity2 for me			1
@entity291 ’s achievement is outstanding but the technology is too important in @entity297 for him to to surpass @entity2 ’s majors and @entity30			1
i hope @entity327 makes the podium , too			0
the way he has settled in @entity330 is outstanding			0
vote for : @entity2 @entity331 ( @entity332 and cricket writer ) if it ’s a choice between @entity2 and @entity291 i ’d go for @entity2 every time			1
golf is one of the loneliest and most mentally challenging sports around and the young @entity339 is at the very top of it			2
a superstar of the modern game			0

@entity2 won @entity12 in july and the @entity345 @entity15 in september
in april he will have his first tilt at becoming just the sixth golfer to complete the career grand slam
the last golfer to win @entity5 was @entity6 in 1989
' i realise there are a lot of great candidates but if i do win , i *'m* hoping it will be an inspiration for young kids to pick up a set of clubs and go and play , ' he said
