@entity1 councillor @entity0 faces complaints for his comments to three children who had been in care a @entity7 councillor faces an investigation after asking children in care how it felt ‘ to be takers from the system ’			1
a dozen complaints have been lodged against @entity0 who also demanded to know when the children would ‘ give back to society ’			1
the 74 - year - old @entity17 left other councillors stunned with his remarks , but his wife insisted he was ' challenging them ' like @entity23 president @entity22 with his famous ' ask not what your country can do for you ' speech			1
mr @entity0 was among several councillors invited to a briefing on their responsibilities as ‘ corporate parents ’ to protect children from abuse			1
three youngsters had made a film about their experiences in foster homes , and were explaining it to the councillors when mr @entity0 interrupted			1
he asked : ‘ how does it feel to be takers from the system ? ’ he reportedly also asked the youngsters when they would ‘ start giving back to society ’ before walking out of the session			1
@entity46 , @entity47 and @entity48 councillors have all submitted complaints about the incident			1
a spokesman for @entity52 said : ‘ the council has received 12 complaints against @entity55 and these are now being looked at			1
‘ it would be inappropriate for the council to comment further			2
’ the incident is the latest embarrassment for @entity7 leader @entity60 , which has been dogged by the outspoken remarks of its elected representatives , many of whom were only elected in may 's local elections			2
conservative councillor @entity68 , who was at the meeting , said : ‘ his comments were demeaning and totally unwarranted and he should be ashamed of himself			2
‘ the three young people were fine examples of how we make a difference helping them overcome adversity			2
’ the comments are the latest embarrassment for @entity7 leader @entity60 , who saw the party win 147 councillors in may @entity0 was not even supposed to be a councillor			1
he was elected to @entity52 in may , despite not making any calls or issuing a single leaflet			1
‘ i just put my name down and that was that			2
i did n’t even ring anyone up , ’ he said at the time			2
his election in the @entity88 ward was among 147 @entity7 candidates elected in the local elections as the party enjoyed a major surge in the polls			0
the former teacher is now a theatre designer and restoration painter			0
the 73 - year - old is married to @entity97 , a well - known campaigner who fought for doctors to be banned from giving contraception to under - 16s without parental consent			0
they have 10 children , including twin sons @entity104 , an artist , and @entity106 , a sculptor			0
@entity48 leader @entity113 added : ‘ to be saying these people are , through no fault of their own , takers from the system , would be totally the opposite of what we should be doing			0
‘ our role should be supporting them to become worthwhile adults , not rubbishing the situation they find themselves in			0
’ however , mr @entity0 has received the backing of @entity7 , which is the third largest group on the authority			1
group leader @entity123 said : ‘ as long as he ’s being honest and transparent and saying what he believes , i ’ve no problem with that			0
‘ it may or may not be that i agree with him or that people find his views offensive , but i would rather a councillor is honest than cover up their beliefs because they are worried about it not being politically correct			0
’ mr @entity0 , a former teacher , artist and theatre designer , was unable to comment on the case			1
but his wife @entity137 told @entity138 : ‘ he is very , very popular with young people			1
he has 15 teenage grandchildren			0
‘ none of the county councillors have ever been inside a classroom			0
their understanding of how you talk to 17 and 18 - year - olds is you patronise them			0
‘ the tendency is to regard looked - after children as somehow retarded when in fact that is not the case			0
‘ his approach is to challenge them			0
he was doing a @entity155 : “ ask not what your country can do for you but what you can do for the country ”			2
‘ he was asking them : have you thought of working and doing things for other people ? for young people that ’s an open challenge which starts a discussion			0

a dozen complaints made against @entity0 after meeting
he challenged three youngsters who made a film about life in care
@entity52 says an investigation has been *launched*
his wife @entity137 compared the comment to @entity22 's ' ask not what your country can do for you but what you can do for the country ' *quote*
