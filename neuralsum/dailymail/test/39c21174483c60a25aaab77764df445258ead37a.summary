former captain of the fictional @entity2 , @entity0 has proposed a radical method to solve @entity5 ’s ongoing drought disaster			1
he is planning to run a @entity7 campaign and is hoping to raise $ 30 billion ( £ 20 billion ) to build a pipeline from @entity9 to bring water to the state			1
but the proposal to build a pipeline hundreds of miles long has been declared ' highly illogical ' by some experts			1
he wants to build a 4ft - wide pipeline from @entity9 down to @entity5 to transport water and solve the state 's ongoing drought problem he revealed the crowdfunding campaign in an interview with @entity26 from @entity19			1
mr @entity0 likened his project to a similar pipeline in @entity29 - with , in this case , the pipeline running from @entity9 to @entity5 down the i - 5 highway			1
since the year 2000 , seven western states in the @entity34 has seen their driest periods in centuries : @entity37 , @entity5 , @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 and @entity42			0
and scientists in @entity5 have warned that the region may be experiencing a century - long ' mega-drought '			2
the warnings came after sediment studies showed @entity5 is currently experiencing the driest spell since 1580 , and that the regular rainfall seen during the last century is likely to have been a temporary deviation in a cycle of droughts and very occasional rainfall over the last 3,000 years			0
in 2013 , @entity5 received less rain than in any year since its formation as a state in 1850			0
and the last four years have seen the worst conditions , with the entire state of @entity5 now declared to be experiencing a drought			2
the pipeline would reportedly be used to fill one of the rapidly drying lakes in @entity5			0
he said @entity9 was ‘ a place where there ’s a lot of water ’ - although its state , @entity65 , is also experiencing a major drought			1
without going into specifics , mr @entity0 added he would need a ‘ large , four - foot pipeline ’ above ground to keep enough water flowing			1
on his website though , @entity0 ’s @entity80 , he is letting people suggest other ideas for what to do with the money - if the campaign is successful			0
if he does n’t get the funding he requires , mr @entity0 says he will give the money he raises to a politician			1
however , @entity7 does n’t allow campaigners to keep any money if they do n’t reach their target , so mr @entity0 may need to use a site such as @entity89 instead , which does			1
the funding campaign has not yet launched and cynics have suggested that the proposal was tongue - in - cheek , or may have been a joke			0
on @entity95 , mr @entity0 responded to some of these comments by posting : ‘ i know i need experts and @ algore and @ elonmusk should be asked to weigh in and join the conversation , ’ he said			1
and responding to complaints that @entity65 was also experiencing a severe drought , he said : ‘ i think [ @entity65 ] folks are thinking i ’m coming in with football field sized sponges in the middle of the night to steal their water			0
’ the ongoing drought is one of @entity5 's worst in history			0
the last four years have seen the worst conditions , with the entire state of @entity5 now declared to be experiencing a drought said the @entity34 @entity116			0
this graphic shows the areas that have been hit the worst without going into specifics , mr @entity0 said he would need a ‘ large , four - foot pipeline ’ above ground to keep enough water flowing			1
on his website @entity80 , he is also letting people suggest other ideas for what to do with the money - if the campaign is successful			0
one of the alternative proposals is pictured @entity5 has had to drastically cut back on water use to deal with the four - year drought that continues to cause devastation			2
but the @entity134 spokesman @entity133 said that mr @entity0 ’s plan was not necessarily the solution they needed			2
‘ frankly we found it highly illogical , to put it in “ @entity142 ” terms , ’ he said			2
‘ this would involve so many obstacles , so many hurdles that it would have to overcome to become reality			0
‘ namely the water of @entity65 , you have to acquire a number of rights to use that water and we would not be approving transfer of a huge volume of water out of our state at this point in time when we have a drought of our own to deal with			0
’ bone dry : a @entity5 farmer is pictured surveying his drought - hit land in @entity163			2

mr @entity0 revealed his radical proposal in an interview with @entity19
he wants to build a 4ft - wide pipeline from @entity9 down to @entity5
this would bring water to help *alleviate* some of the drought problems
but some experts have called his $ 30 billion idea ' highly illogical '
