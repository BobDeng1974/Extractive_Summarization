@entity1 ’s defence of his @entity3 title became much more difficult on tuesday when he fell heavily and injured his right wrist and left side early on stage four			1
it was an innocuous - looking crash but the consequences could be devastating before today ’s fifth stage over the pave roads of north - eastern @entity11			2
@entity1 tumbled after a touch of wheels when he was close to the front			2
although he was quickly back on his bike he paused for medical treatment before rejoining the peloton			0
he had his wrist strapped and , at the finish , did not go through his usual warming - down ritual			1
thumbs up : @entity1 crashed during stage four of the @entity3 and again the day after painful : @entity1 injured his wrist after falling and he will be tested on the cobbles of the fifth stage instead , @entity1 was taken to hospital in @entity25 for an x-ray , although @entity28 principal sir @entity27 insisted this was a precaution			1
‘ @entity1 is all right , ’ said @entity27			2
‘ he felt fine in the final , good physically , but we are going to send him for a precautionary x-ray to check his wrist			1
he landed on his hand and wrist			0
‘ we ’d have preferred it if @entity1 had n’t crashed but he felt fine in the final bit			1
we know it ’s part of the rough and tumble of pro bike racing			0
’ the stage continued the domination of the big @entity42 sprinter @entity41 , though this was by far the toughest of his three stage wins after successes in @entity46 and @entity47			0
having lost his sprint train he had to improvise but when @entity50 ’s @entity49 took a flier @entity41 was more than a length adrift			0
on the line , @entity53 won by centimetres as @entity49 thumped his handlebars in frustration			0
@entity49 could also face legal action after suggesting in the @entity50 media that @entity61 ’s @entity60 crashed deliberately in @entity46			0
nasty : @entity1 was swiftly back on his bike after the collision which also brought down @entity64 on a roll : @entity41 looks delighted as he wins for the second stage in two days for @entity1 , the timing of his crash could hardly have been worse			1
wednesday ’s stage has been the most talked about in the build - up to the @entity3			1
the nine pave sections are bone - jarring at the best of times and positively excruciating when a rider is nursing a wrist injury			1
these are the roads that characterise the toughest one - day race on the cycling calendar , @entity79			2
known as the @entity81 , it is renowned for the cobbled roads that are no longer in general use but are preserved , in their decrepit state , for the classic race			0
the cobbles last featured in 2010 , when one of the favourites , @entity88 , crashed and broke a collarbone			2
six years before that , a crash on the pave ended the hopes of the @entity96 climber @entity95			0
this year ’s cobbled sections are the most severe in years , and a controversial inclusion			1
with rain forecast , @entity1 ’s priority will be to remain in contention on a day when at least one favourite is expected to lose his chance of winning the event			0
pack : @entity41 of @entity42 ( centre ) comes through for the third time in four stages photo finish : @entity41 wins stage four of the @entity3 by a wheel from @entity49 boxed in : @entity1 gets involved in a tight pack before the crash forces him to hit the gravel crash : @entity1 begins to fall after being ridden into during stage four of the tour playing around : @entity119 's @entity118 , wearing the overall leader 's yellow jersey , and @entity122 of @entity123 leader : yellow jersey holder @entity118 of @entity119 goes to the start of the 4th stage			1

@entity1 crashed during stage four of the tour from @entity132 - @entity131
he required a *splint* on his wrist to finish stage and had precautionary x-ray
@entity1 dropped back from fifth to seventh in overall @entity3 rankings
wednesday 's stage five will see riders cycling *155.5km* route between @entity144 and @entity145 which features nine cobbled sections
the 15km of cobbles will put a severe strain on his wrist injury
