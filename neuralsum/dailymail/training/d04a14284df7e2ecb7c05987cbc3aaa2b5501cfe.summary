@entity0 is desperate for a bone marrow or stem cell transplant before the @entity3 , after doctors revealed she is battling cancer for a second time teenager @entity0 dreams of becoming a doctor			1
but before she can embark on making her ambition a reality , the 17 - year - old has another , more pressing challenge			1
@entity0 needs a life - saving bone marrow or stem cell transplant , and she needs it for @entity14			1
last month specialists told the teenager a transplant is her only hope			2
the 17 - year - old is fighting non hodgkin ( burkitts ) lymphoma for a second time			1
she was first diagnosed in december last year but after four courses of chemotherapy she was declared free of the disease in april			1
but @entity0 's world came crashing down again on november 13 , when doctors revealed the cancer had returned			1
her siblings were tested , but were n't a match for their sister , leaving a donation from a stranger the only option			2
and so @entity0 has launched a drive to encourage people to give the gift of life this @entity14 , by signing up to the @entity41 donation register			1
@entity0 , from @entity42 in @entity43 , told @entity44 : ' this time we 're bringing out all the weaponry , guns blazing to kick this cancer 's ass , good and proper			1
' the teenager , whose blog is called @entity52 , has previously written in support of the charity and other families in need of a donor , not knowing she would one day need a transplant herself			0
@entity0 was diagnosed with @entity59 in december 2013 , after she noticed her stomach was swelling and her jeans had become tighter			1
scans revealed the swelling was cancer			2
' i 'd never been to the @entity66 before			0
being ill just did n't happen to me , it was normally my brothers and sisters , ' @entity0 said			2
' it was right before @entity14 , and was just so much to take in ; i knew it was going to change my life			1
' i love school , i 'm a total nerd so it was just horrible to know i was missing out			0
with every needle they stuck in , it just sunk in even more			0
' following four courses of chemotherapy , @entity0 was given the news she was clear of cancer on april 17			1
it was this that spurred her on to start her blog remission possible , to help others facing similar journeys			0
the 17 - year - old was first diagnosed with @entity88 ( @entity89 ) lymphoma in december last year			1
after going into remission in april , her disease returned last month			1
doctors revealed her only hope is a transplant from a stranger after tests revealed her sister @entity97 , pictured left , and other siblings are n't a match ' it was simply amazing to be told i was in remission , ' @entity0 said			1
' it seemed like a great place to start the blog from , april 18 , 2014 , and my first full day officially cancer free			0
' it was such a long time coming			0
' i set up remission possible to thank everyone who helped me to be in remission and as the blog 's tagline says , ' because you never choose the mission of cancer - we all have to accept it and fight on '			2
lymphoma is a type of blood cancer that affects the lymphatic system , an important part of the immune system			2
a patient with the disease will make too many lymphocytes , a type of white blood cell			0
and those lymphocytes live longer than they should			0
the overload compromises the immune system , which is designed to protect the body from infection and disease			0
@entity59 can develop in many parts of the body , including a person 's lymph nodes , bone marrow , blood , spleen and other organs			1
there are two main types of lymphoma - non-hodgkin and hodgkin			2
most are non-hodgkin lymphoma - the sixth most common cancer in the @entity148			2

@entity156 lymphoma is a rare form of non-hodgkin lymphoma , affecting the b - cells in the body			2
there are three different forms of @entity158 , two of which are linked to the @entity165 , which causes glandular fever			0
the third occurs in patients who have had an organ transplant and are taking medicines to stop their immune system rejecting the transplant			0
the most common early symptom is swelling in the lymph nodes			0
the lymphoma can often appear as a lump or mass in the tummy area , which can cause pain and swelling , nausea and diarrhoea			0
some sufferers will also experience night sweats , high temperatures and weight loss			0
source : @entity41 and @entity188 ' i wanted to help young people in their fight and raise awareness so others can see the symptoms of cancer			1
' while she was in remission , @entity0 supported various campaigns for people searching for a match like the @entity201 campaign			1
at the time , @entity0 had no idea she would be launching a similar campaign of her own			2
last month , after feeling unwell , the 17 - year - old went back to the doctors			1
they revealed her cancer had returned , and for @entity0 , life was put on hold			1
she postponed plans to study medicine at university			0
' i was devastated , i had just applied to university and my life was getting back on track , ' she said			0
' @entity218 is n't the end of @entity52 , it may be our true beginning			0
' i have no choice but to accept my new mission			0
' this time we 're bringing out all the weaponry , guns blazing to kick this cancer 's ass , and forever , not just for me but for the 2,000 other people out there who need a transplant each year			1
' since launching her campaign to encourage people to sign the register , @entity41 have received 278 successful applications in @entity43			1
and @entity0 has received support from celebrity comedian @entity237 and singer @entity238 , who tweeted about @entity0 's blog			2
@entity0 's mother , @entity240 said : ' when @entity0 was diagnosed with cancer our world changed in an instant			1
' but i now feel empowered to make a difference by signing up as many people to the register as possible			0
' i ca n't thank enough every person who has signed up to the register for @entity0 and others like her			2
together we can help @entity0 make another mission possible to beat cancer again			2

mrs @entity0 , said : ' our family life has been through a lot of changes over the past year , and we 've been as honest as you can be with a four , nine and 15 - year - old			1
' @entity14 had to be rescheduled and having younger children was a juggling act			0
' @entity275 practice , choir and @entity277 exams also had to continue as family life had to go on in some capacity , for everyone 's sake			0

' myself and my husband @entity298 have missed each other , we passed on the motorway like ships in the night			0
' trying to ensure one of us was at the hospital 12 hours a day and the other was home was a mammoth task , as anyone can imagine			0

we do n't feel unlucky but the complete opposite			0
we are so lucky to have these children			0
they enrich our live beyond words			0
