some nations are developing swarms of small drones for combat , spying on warzones as well as dropping payloads			0
but @entity6 has reportedly set its sights on a supersonic behemoth , which could strike terror into the hearts of any enemies in the future			0
called the @entity14 , the conceptual aircraft is designed to carry troops and tanks at supersonic speeds and could take to the skies as early as 2024			1
but some commentators say it ’s unlikely that the plans will get off the ground			0
the plane is an unusual shape because it is intended to carry up to eight @entity44 tanks - which have yet to be built – complete with ammunition to anywhere in the world at supersonic speeds			1
it would fly at speeds of over 1,200mph ( 2,000km/h ) despite carrying a payload of up to 200 tonnes ( 200,000kg ) with a range of more than 4,350 miles ( 7,000km )			1
the plane is an unusual shape because it is intended to carry up to eight @entity44 tanks - which have yet to be built – complete with ammunition to ‘ anywhere in the world ’ at supersonic speeds			1
this illustration shows a cavernous opening at the back of the aircraft the programme envisages that 80 of these new aircraft ( illustrated ) would be built by 2024 , enabling @entity6 to be able to drop a ready - made army wherever it may be needed in under seven hours conceptual : the @entity14 aircraft is only a concept			1
purpose : the aircraft is designed to carry troops and tanks at supersonic speeds , so that a small army could be deployed anywhere in the world in just seven hours			1
speed : the plane would fly at supersonic speeds of over 1,200mph ( 2,000km/h )			1
payload : up to 200 tonnes ( 2 million kg ) which is enough for several tanks and ammunition			1
range : more than 4,350 miles ( 7,000km )			0
power : a video hints that the plane could be partially electric			0
timing : the @entity14 programme envisages that 80 of the aircraft would be built by 2024			2
the speed is comparable to that of a light fighter jet , leading some commentators to brand the plans improbable and more of a flight of fancy than a serious plan			0
the top speed of the @entity98 ’ largest transport plane – the @entity96 – is 518mph ( 834km/h ) @entity94 reported			0
the design , imagined by an employee of a @entity6 aircraft company , also hints that if the plane were to be built , it would be partially powered by electricity			0
while batteries can power small electric planes , the technology is unlikely to develop quickly enough to drive a huge supersonic craft , like the @entity14			2
the programme envisages that 80 of these new aircraft would be built by 2024 , enabling @entity6 to be able to drop a ready - made army wherever it may be needed in under seven hours , @entity108 reported			2
the vehicles could load cargo autonomously and be able to airdrop tanks and men onto tricky terrain			0
the aircraft ( illustrated ) would fly at speeds of over 1,200mph ( 2,000km/h ) despite carrying a payload of up to 200 tonnes ( 2million kg ) with a range of more than 4,350 miles ( 7,000km ) the design ( pictured ) also hints that if the plane were to be built , it would be partially powered by electricity			1
so while batteries and electric batteries can power small planes , the technology is unlikely to develop quickly enough to drive a huge supersonic craft , like the @entity14 ‘ with the development of a network of military bases in the @entity134 , @entity135 and @entity136 , which is expected to be completed during the same time period [ by 2024 ] , it ’s obvious that @entity6 is preparing for a full - scale military confrontation of transcontinental scale , ’ @entity108 reported			2
the @entity14 project is thought to have been underway for several years and is designed to replace the current generation of air freighters - @entity144 and @entity145 cargo aircraft			2
the only operating aircraft that can carry a comparable amount of weight is the @entity149 , which is a one - off and is built for the @entity151 space shuttle programme .			0

@entity14 plane is a conceptual aircraft intended to carry 200 tonnes
it would reach speeds of over 200mph ( 2,000km/h ) with a long range
could deliver an army anywhere in the world in around seven hours
commentators are *sceptical* the *hybrid* electric plane will get off the ground
