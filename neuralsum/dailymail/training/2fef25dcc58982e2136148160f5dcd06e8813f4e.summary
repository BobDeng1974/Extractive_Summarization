by @entity0 published : 17:23 est , 2 november 2012 updated : 17:24 est , 2 november 2012 a @entity2 writer has lashed out at people in the fashion industry , calling them 'd * * * s ' after a few ' badly behaved ' guests at a plus - size runway show barely concealed their snide sniggers at the curvier than normal proportions on the catwalk			1
disgusted : writer @entity10 overheard people laughing and making jokes at the models at an @entity15 event hosted by @entity17 designer @entity16 last week , @entity10 was disgusted to overhear people laughing and making jokes at the expense of the models			1
‘ are we so unwilling to accept plus - size fashion shows because it is a reminder of who we could become ? ’ he wrote in monday ’s @entity27 sparking an explosion of similarly impassioned reactions from readers			1
mr @entity31 was quick to admit in his story that he used to weigh 300lbs and worried excessively about being perceived as fat			1
but after jumping on the healthy living bandwagon and shifting 80 lbs , he recalled the moment he realised he might never entirely lose his slightly rotund gut and stopped worrying			1
the writer was excited to take a friend to one of the shows during @entity41 and chose the @entity42 because of its special platform			2
@entity16 launched the clothing line in tribute to her daughter @entity47 in 2006 who as a victim of @entity49 at the time was battling with fluctuating weight gain			2
@entity47 passed away and mr @entity31 saw the runway show as a moving legacy to @entity47 and a fun introduction to fashion week			1
his friend , he wrote , was ‘ was excited , and yet , not one person outside of me and the @entity60 ’s @entity59 was excited for him			2
“ you brought him to this as his first fashion show ? ” was the general consensus from people we spoke to			2
’ during the event , mr @entity31 noticed one man hiding behind his line sheet to cover his face as he laughed and others whispering and chuckling together			1
a model walks the runway wearing @entity15 spring 2013 collection at @entity77 mr @entity31 , who attended the fashion show , admitted in his story that he used to weigh 300lbs and worried excessively about being perceived as fat some of the models admitted to becoming ' tearful and angry ' when they learned what had happened ‘ even four different people were overheard talking about how poorly the women walked because they were bigger women on high heels , ’ he recalled			1
outraged by the tactless response and shocked that a woman who is n’t rail thin might be considered a laughing stock by the fashion elite , mr @entity31 ranted : the next time i hear or see someone laughing at a plus - size model on a @entity2 runway , i ’m going to get up and walk that person out of the room			1
‘ if you ca n’t behave , you ’re going home			2
’ his article has fuelled its own response by angry readers who share his disappointment in the fashion line			0
‘ it 's not just fashion week in @entity2 that brings the " d * * * " out in people , ’ wrote one			0
‘ i am plus sized and not a model - imagine what that brings out in people			0
’ ‘ i wish i had been at this show and could have celebrated the talented designers and beautiful models who were involved ! ’ wrote another more optimistic reader			0
one of the models in the show also weighed in with a personal post			0
‘ the first time i read this piece , i teared up , ’ she wrote			0
‘ the second time , a rage began trembling in my gut			0
i was a model in the @entity15 show ... i was honoured to be walking in @entity41 , and to be representing not only a cause i believed in , but a generation of women and girls who have been told that - as is - their bodies are not good enough			1
‘ i ’m a size 10			0
and i ’m still a damn model			0
40 ” hips and all			0
and i ’d challenge the gentleman hiding his snickers behind the line sheet to call me on it			0

@entity31 noticed one man covering his face as he laughed
others *criticized* how the ' poorly the women walked because they were bigger women on high heels '
