by @entity0 @entity1 : 19:20 est , 17 december 2013 @entity2 : 19:20 est , 17 december 2013 a peer jailed for fiddling his expenses has been caught ‘ clocking in ’ to the @entity6 for barely half an hour a day to claim his £ 300 daily attendance fee			1
but yesterday @entity9 defended himself saying that ‘ at least half ’ of all peers were also abusing the allowance system – before going even further and claiming : ‘ they all do it			1
’ during july , @entity9 was monitored clocking in for as little as 21 minutes a day to register for his fee			1
on 11 out of 19 days , for which he claimed £ 5,700 , he spent fewer than 40 minutes in @entity16			1
the left - hand picture shows @entity9 arriving at @entity19 station at 14.36 , ahead of walking to the @entity20			1
the right - hand picture shows him getting back on the tube less than half an hour later and last night , @entity9 – who was expelled from the @entity22 after being jailed in 2011 over the expenses scandal – faced the prospect of a police investigation after @entity27 mp @entity26 made a formal complaint to @entity29			1
mr @entity26 said : ‘ no reasonable person could describe what he is doing as parliamentary work			1
‘ there are clearly issues here that need investigation by the police			2
‘ it is potentially not just immoral behaviour			2
i ’m sure the police will want to investigate him			2
’ but @entity9 yesterday defended his right to claim his fee for such short spells in @entity16 , and tried to draw other members of the @entity6 into the scandal			1
he said : ‘ i could say the whole 600 sometimes just go in to clock in			2
a lot of the @entity50 , because they get salaries , do n’t go in at all			0
at least we have to go in			0
‘ being a @entity9 is not just going in to the @entity6			1
it ’s the post you have			0
i have 15 letters a day			0
i have all sorts of things like that			0
i can do some of it at home , i can do some of it at my office in the @entity6			0
’ @entity9 was caught by undercover reporters from the @entity65 , who monitored his parliamentary activity during july			1
' the whole 600 sometimes just go in to clock in ' : @entity9 tried to defend his behaviour by saying it was commonplace among his colleagues but speaking outside his £ 700,000 home in @entity73 yesterday , he said : ‘ i ’ve done nothing wrong , i ’ve been doing my work			1
i double - check with the finance department all the time			0
i do n’t have this money myself , i give it to other people			0
i ’ve never made a penny out of my public work			1
’ yesterday the prime minister ’s official spokesman said @entity86 had been ‘ dismayed ’ by the revelation about @entity9 , and leader of the @entity6 , @entity83 , said that peers found to be exploiting the daily allowance system would be banned from @entity16			1
despite being jailed for nine months over the expenses scandal , @entity9 was allowed back in the @entity6 and has claimed nearly £ 51,300 in allowances between april 2012 and july 2013			1
during that time he did not make any speeches in the @entity94			0
since october , @entity9 has spoken twice and submitted four written questions			1
he told the @entity96 : ‘ doing work in the @entity6 is not just working in the chamber , unless you are going to speak			1
during july i was preparing myself for what i ’m doing now , and during this term i ’ve been speaking and asking questions			0
i ’m really back to an active life in politics and i do n’t appreciate the @entity65 following me around in july			0
’ the former @entity106 leader claimed he spent half of the £ 300 daily fee on expenses and so did not really make any profit			1
he was a full - time peer who needed the money to pay his electricity bills and buy food , he said			0
he added : ‘ you have to go in to get the allowances but you do most of your work not in the @entity119			2
’ he also claimed he was writing his memoirs to set the record straight about how he was ‘ wrongly charged and wrongly convicted ’ of expenses fraud			0
yesterday , lord @entity83 told the @entity6 that party leaders were ‘ dismayed about the shadow it casts over the whole @entity6 ’			0
he told peers that there would be a new sanction to withdraw financial support and access to facilities for lords who breach a code of conduct which is expected to be introduced in the new year			2
lord @entity83 also called for the code of conduct to be tightened up to take action against those who ‘ bring the @entity6 into disrepute ’			0
a backbench bill brought forward by @entity22 mp @entity141 would also allow the permanent expulsion of members of the @entity6 who commit serious criminal offences			0
@entity145 criticised the system that allowed convicted peers to continue sitting in the @entity6			2
‘ you can stroll out of the prison gates in the morning and into the @entity6 after lunch and claim your allowances , ’ he told @entity148			0
‘ that is , i think , completely unacceptable that we have a system of convicted criminals sitting in the @entity6 and voting on our laws			0
we need the whole place to be cleaned up , we need it elected , we need half the number of people , the whole thing is a mess			1
’ the @entity164 , which has campaigned for an elected @entity6 , said : ‘ when people look at the @entity6 , they see an outdated institution which bears no relation to their own experiences			0
it ’s no wonder people feel alienated from politics when they see peers clocking on for £ 300 a day and clocking off shortly after			1
after all , who ’d be able to get away with that in normal life ? ’ there are currently 779 ‘ eligible ’ members of the @entity6			0
more than 40 other peers have taken a ‘ leave of absence ’ for health or professional reasons , meaning they can not attend			2
a retirement scheme was introduced in 2011 to encourage peers no longer attending to step down voluntarily , but so far only three peers have used it .			2

@entity9 claims ' at least half ' of peers also do the same thing
' i *'ve* never made a penny out of my public work , ' he says
he was *spotted* clocking in for as little as 21 minutes to collect his fee
