with star summer signings @entity1 and @entity3 still on a beach after the @entity5 , it was left to @entity7 ’s young charges to take care of their first pre-season friendly at @entity10			1
aided by stalwarts @entity12 , @entity13 and @entity14 , the young @entity16 side stormed to a 5 - 0 win with many of the younger charges impressing			1
here , @entity20 looks at some of the starlets on display @entity23 may be running the rule over to supplement his first - team set - up			1
his goal showed off his main asset – a well - taken , instinctive first - time finish from @entity53 ’s cross from the byline – everything @entity7 ’s goal - shy strikers were missing last season			2
@entity36 ’s display was n’t limited to opening the scoring , however , as he was soon in his own penalty area saving a certain equaliser with a goal - line clearance			2
the @entity16 are famously light up front – new signing @entity1 excepted – with @entity65 continuing to disappoint and @entity66 looking for opportunities elsewhere , so it is actually possible @entity36 could have some role to play in the first team this season			1
however , to continue his steady development with more game - time , a @entity72 loan could be the way forward			0
impress there and the sky ’s the limit			0
potential : @entity36 celebrates putting @entity7 ahead in their pre-season opener @entity28 @entity23 splashed £ 12million on the @entity81 under - 21 defender in january , but this was his first outing in @entity7 colours , having been loaned straight back to @entity85			1
@entity28 came on mid-way through the first half for the injured @entity87 at right - back , not his normal position			0
he made attempts to offer width by bombing up @entity10 ’s unguarded flank , occasionally showing a rashness of touch that match fitness will no doubt sharpen			0
the 19 - year - old looked far more assured once moved to centre - half next to @entity12			0
showing awareness , calmness and the no - nonsense physical style that became his trademark in the @entity81 league , the defender will have impressed the travelling support			0
with @entity105 out of the picture and last season ’s back - up @entity107 famed out on loan , @entity28 now has every chance of cementing a squad place as @entity7 ’s third - choice centre - half			1
dominant : @entity28 looked comfortable at the back for @entity7 during their easy win @entity116 @entity7 snapped up the 17 - year - old from @entity118 last year and the striker – a regular for @entity120 under - 17s – impressed in the @entity16 youth academy last season			1
@entity116 entered the fray in the second half at @entity126 , and immediately made his mark by deftly turning diminutive left - back @entity129 ’s cross into the top corner to double @entity7 ’s lead			2
after @entity12 and @entity13 showed their experience by putting the game out of @entity10 ’s reach , @entity116 completed the rout with the goal of the night – a first - time right - footed thunderbolt from outside the area			0
@entity116 ’s impressive technique and physicality should see him a success in the @entity143 game , but at just 17 perhaps a loan move beckons for his development this campaign			0
youthful quality : @entity116 is congratulated after scoring to double @entity7 's lead at @entity126 @entity148 @entity7 took control of the game at @entity10 in the second half , with four of the five goals coming once the experienced @entity12 , @entity13 and @entity14 came on			1
however , it was n’t those @entity16 stalwarts that most caught the eye			0
although @entity116 ’s two goals grabbed the headlines , 17 - year - old @entity158 became the team ’s playmaking fulcrum , with @entity7 ’s attacking movement going through him			1
considered one of the brightest prospects in the @entity165 academy and consistently playing above his age group , @entity166 wo n’t be troubling the first team this season but may look to cement his role as one of the key players for @entity7 ’s trophy - laden under - 21 side			1
impressive : @entity158 had a hand in a couple of goals at @entity126 as @entity7 won 5 - 0 @entity178 the @entity180 midfielder cruelly had a promising campaign last season cut short thanks to a cruciate ligament injury in the @entity185 at @entity186			1
this his first first - team appearance since then , @entity187 took control of midfield in his first half role , showing the wide array of passing that impressed fans on his arrival at the club last summer			2
on the fringe of the @entity199 national side , @entity187 has work to do if he is to muscle his way into the reckoning in an ever - more competitive @entity7 midfield			0
@entity187 is capable of sitting in a central ‘ two ’ in @entity23 ’s 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 formation , a position possibly not suited to the more attacking @entity3			2
if being able to be called upon to sit alongside @entity14 can become a unique selling point then @entity187 can be a vital squad player for the @entity16 this season – if not a loan move beckons			0
@entity7 agree fee for @entity209			0

a number of @entity7 's promising youngsters grabbed their chance to impress @entity23 during the comfortable *victory* on *wednesday*
@entity36 , @entity28 , @entity116 and @entity158 *excelled* in the 5 - 0 win
summer signings @entity1 and @entity3 have not *joined* the squad for pre-season yet , following their @entity5 exploits with @entity221
@entity7 are hopeful some of their academy players will make the step up to the first - team squad over the coming season
