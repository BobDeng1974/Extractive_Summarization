@entity0 beat @entity1 in the final of the @entity3 on saturday in a display that bodes well for her chances at the @entity6			1
it has been seven years since @entity0 won her only @entity6 title but if she can take her form from @entity11 to @entity12 , a second title does not seem out of the question			1
@entity0 had to work hard to beat @entity1 , coming from behind to beat her 6 - 7 ( 4 ) 6 - 3 6 - 3 but the @entity14 is a good measuring stick			2
' i played four good matches against very different types of opponents , ' @entity0 said			2
' i could n't have asked for better preparation			0
' the @entity19 dropped just nine games in getting to the final while @entity1 showed nerves of steel to see off her opponents to join @entity0 , ranked number two in the world			1
it was a match that could have gone either way but @entity0 proved too strong once she got her nose in front in the deciding third set at the @entity44			1
@entity0 poses with her trophy while opponent @entity1 looks in the @entity11 crowd ' she deserved to win the first set , no doubt , but i hung in there , ' @entity0 said			1
' it was important to get that break			0
i held that and the third set came down to a few points really			0
' winning the @entity3 provided @entity0 with her 34th @entity57 career title and her fifth in the last nine months , a red - hot span in which she also captured a second @entity60 and a first @entity61			2
the 27 - year - old has won at least one title every year since 2003 , an unbroken streak of 15 years			0
for @entity1 , who has begun a resurgence up the world rankings in the past year , the pain of losing was compounded by an abdominal strain which forced her to seek medical attention but is unlikely to disrupt her @entity6 campaign			2
' i really thought it was a high quality match from the first moment on			0
there were not many unforced errors			0
we both played a high quality match i thought , ' @entity1 said			0
@entity1 ( right ) congratulates @entity0 after losing to the @entity19 in @entity77			1

@entity0 *closed* the gap on @entity80 with title win
the @entity19 has chance to *overhaul* @entity80 in women 's rankings during upcoming @entity6
@entity0 said her opponent ' deserved ' to win the first set
