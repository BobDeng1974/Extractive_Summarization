but one group of big game watchers in @entity12 's @entity11 had no option but to get up close and personal with the world 's fastest land animal			1
expecting to only admire the animal from afar , the group was taken aback when the spotted cat pounced on its 4x4 and sat only inches away			2
strike a pose : the cheetah unexpectedly pounced on the big game watchers ' 4x4 in @entity12 's @entity11 she 's a natural : amateur photographer dr @entity24 captured the amazing moment , as the female cheetah struck poses only inches from the amazed tourists close - up : dr @entity24 captured the cheetah from only inches away			1
the doctor , from @entity32 , @entity33 , said the animal was so close he could feel its breath rather than trying to intimidate or analyse the group of stunned tourists , the female cheetah struck up a number of poses as they began to take pictures			2
amateur photographer dr @entity24 , 44 , could not believe his luck when the cat pounced on the vehicle			1
the doctor , from @entity32 , @entity33 , was able to take a number of close - ups of the cat through the vehicle 's sun roof , before it left and jumped on a second truck full of tourists dr @entity24 described the incident as ' a bit of a dream ' and said the cat was so close he could feel its breath			1
cat on a hot tin roof : a tourist poses beside the female cheetah , which is the world 's fastest land animal and a deadly hunter elegant : the tourists described the animal as ' very friendly ' and said that the cheetah showed ' no aggression at all ' he said : ' l was taking photos of a cheetah and her cub when she started getting very close to our vehicle			2
within a second she had jumped on to the roof which was totally open			0
he added : ' l could n't do anything for the first minutes as it felt like a bit of a dream			0
' @entity79 remembered my camera and started taking some shots while thinking " has anybody seen a cheetah from this angle before ? " ' after about 20 minutes the cheetah hopped from @entity24 's vehicle and on to another 4x4 close by			1
the cat stayed on one of the vehicles for 20 minutes before leaving and jumping onto another tourist vehicle nearby into the sunset : after posing for the tourists , the female jumped off the vehicle and walked towards the sunset on the @entity11 ' my driver said he had never seen anything like it in 10 years			1
' the cheetah did n't show any sign of aggression at all , was very friendly actually			0
if she wanted , she could easily have harmed me			0
' the cat 's brazen behaviour and comfortable nature around the tourists is not all that surprising given that the animals were once kept by humans as pets			2
rulers in @entity114 partly domesticated the animals and even tamed them for hunting			0
hooded cheetahs would be transported to hunting grounds , where dogs would first flush out the prey			0
as cheetahs hunt by sight , rather than scent , they would then be released to chase down the prey			0
their domestication was also adopted by the @entity127 and other leaders such as @entity129 , @entity130 the @entity131 and @entity132 .			0
