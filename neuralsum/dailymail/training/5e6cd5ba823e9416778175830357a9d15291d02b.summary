by @entity0 it was one of the moments of the @entity3 - a nation mourned as @entity6 poster boy @entity5 was put out of the tournament after a crude challenge by @entity10 defender @entity9			1
and now the shirt worn by the full back when he caused @entity5 's back injury can be yours to own from auctioneer @entity16 , who claim to have got hold of @entity9 's shirt from the fateful night in @entity20			0
the bidding started at $ 500 a week ago and is already up to $ 1400 , with 11 days to go before the auction closes			1
getting shirty : you can guarantee yourself the shirt worn by @entity9 with a bid of $ 10,000 agony : @entity5 lies on the turf after suffering a broken back caused by @entity9 's late challenge where do you think you 're going ? @entity9 and @entity5 clash in the @entity3 quarter - final in @entity6 @entity16 clearly feels no shame about auctioning off the shirt and even adds : ' to all @entity10 's and @entity9 's fans : your passion lives on ! ' anyone interested in this slightly bizarre artifact can end the auction and secure the shirt by bidding $ 10,000			1
party time : @entity5 enjoys a night out with @entity41 as he took a holiday in @entity43 earlier this month peace out : @entity45 forward @entity5 has been hanging out with friends before the new season starts @entity5 recovered from the injury setback by partying with friends in @entity43 , where he also found time to hang out with @entity41			2
the @entity6 forward is back in training but is not expected to be fit for @entity45 's opening match of the season , against @entity54 on 25 august			0
@entity9 meanwhile will be looking forward to the new season with @entity56 , and a chance to make himself known for something besides injuring the @entity6 talisman			0
back to business : @entity9 has returned to @entity56 and will be hoping to fire the @entity61 to glory this season			0

@entity64 put @entity5 out of the @entity3 with *aggressive* challenge
the bidding for the shirt , owned by @entity16 , has risen to $ 1400
a $ 10,000 bid would secure the *kit* , otherwise the auction will end in 11 days
the @entity6 star has been partying with @entity41 earlier this *summer*
