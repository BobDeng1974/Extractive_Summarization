a @entity1 court of appeals in @entity2 has decided to hear oral arguments on may 4 in a lawsuit that challenges president @entity6 's executive actions on immigration			1
a lower - court federal judge threw out the case in december , brought by @entity11 , @entity13 sheriff @entity12			1
his lawyer , conservative firebrand @entity14 , told reporters outside the courtroom after he pleaded his case that ' we have serious issues of constitutionality involved			0
' @entity12 claims the @entity22 's plan to mainstream more than 5 million illegal immigrants is clearly unconstitutional			1
lawsuit : @entity11 , @entity13 sheriff @entity12 has a date with a federal appeals court , which will re-hear his legal challenge against president @entity6 's controversial immigration executive actions @entity14 of the conservative nonprofit @entity29 represents @entity12 's sheriff 's office , and wants an injunction to stop @entity6 from granting legal status to millions of illegal immigrants @entity6 plans to give them @entity36 numbers , residency cards and work permits , even though they snuck into the @entity1 illegally			1
the lawsuit argues that the policy changes , made without approval from the @entity44 - dominated @entity43 , amount to an amnesty and will encourage more people to cross the border			2
last month a @entity49 judge ordered the @entity6 administration to halt its implementation of the plan , saying it would be impossible to roll back the action if a higher court ruled that it violates the @entity1 @entity55			2
last week , the @entity56 requested an emergency stay to put that decision on hold so the @entity60 could move ahead			0
@entity12 , a colorful and polarizing figure , is known for his ' tent city ' jail where inmates brave the elements are are forced to wear pink underwear and clothing			0
some of his deputies also use pink handcuffs while on duty in the jails			0
he has employed ' chain gangs ' to force inmates to work outside his facilities			0
and he once put inmates on a bread and water diet for desecrating an @entity1 flag			0
@entity12 also famously claimed in 2012 that president @entity6 's birth certificate was ' fraudulent			1
' the administration has been busily fending off a handful of legal actions designed to stop it from guaranteeing that millions of illegal immigrants could live in the @entity1 with a guarantee that they wo n't be deported			1
@entity12 's suit is the first to reach the level of a federal appeals court , the final step before a possible @entity93 review			2
@entity94 , the @entity95 judge who tossed his legal action late last year , was nominated to the federal bench by @entity6 in 2010			0
she ruled that the sheriff lacked legal standing to challenge @entity6 's immigration program , and it should be tackled in @entity43			2
but @entity14 , the attorney , had argued that the president 's plan would burden @entity1 law enforcement as more illegal immigrants enter the country and commit crimes			1
' it 's not policy , ' @entity14 said in december			0
' he 's creating law and he can not do that under the @entity55			0
' inspired by sheriff @entity12 , other law enforcement agencies are now forcing inmates to wear pink ; these jailed men are in @entity115 , @entity116 this week @entity44 in the @entity22 and @entity117 failed in a bid to tie @entity60 funding to an order prohibiting the government from spending any money implementing @entity6 's immigration vision			1
@entity12 has suffered stinging political defeats in his attempts to slow the flow of illegal immigrants into his @entity13 county			1
@entity11 has already disbanded its squad of deputies that has raided businesses , arresting more than 700 immigrants who were charged with using fake or stolen ids to get jobs			0
on december 17 @entity12 threw in the towel on the effort , which won him popularity among voters but was gradually dismantled by the @entity6 administration and the courts .			2

court of appeals in @entity2 will hear the case in may , the last stop on a *journey* that may end in the @entity93
