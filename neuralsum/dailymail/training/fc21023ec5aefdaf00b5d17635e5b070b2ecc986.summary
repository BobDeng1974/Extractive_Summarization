by @entity0 published : 13:16 est , 20 november 2012 updated : 02:48 est , 21 november 2012 @entity1 today ended its combat operations in @entity3 , pulling hundreds of troops from a base in a volatile region northeast of @entity7 and fulfilling promises to end its combat role on a faster track than other @entity13 allies			1
after a handover ceremony with @entity3 troops , 500 @entity1 combat soldiers in trucks and armored vehicles left the @entity19 base in the @entity21 region , where anti-government insurgents have been active , and traveled southwest to @entity7 , the capital , said col. @entity23 , a @entity1 military spokesman			1
' this is the end of combat operations , ' @entity23 said , adding that the withdrawal went smoothly			0
' it 's the end of support operations for the @entity29 because we have no more troops who can deploy in such a role			2

@entity1 combat troops are due to pull out of @entity3 by the end of the year @entity1 was once one of the largest contributors to the @entity13 mission in @entity3 , with a peak deployment of 4,000 troops - though far smaller than the tens of thousands of @entity52 troops there			1
since mid- 2008 , @entity1 forces were deployed in @entity21 , a crescent - shaped and strategic region along mountains between @entity7 and the @entity56 border			1
@entity1 already pulled out its forces from the neighboring @entity59 district of @entity60 - a less violent area than @entity21 - earlier this year after then - president @entity62 said his country would pull combat troops out ahead of @entity13 's 2014 timetable for the @entity52 - led combat operation to end			1
withdrawal : at its peak deployment , @entity1 had 4,000 troops in @entity3 replacement : @entity29 soldiers will now oversee operations in @entity21 @entity1 public opinion has gradually soured on the ongoing @entity3 mission , and a string of insurgent attacks that raised the @entity1 death toll preceded a decision by both @entity62 and his successor to speed up the @entity1 withdrawal			1
@entity1 has lost 88 troops in @entity3 since late 2001			1
those that remain : @entity83 troops taking position in @entity85			2
the @entity83 has roughly 9,500 troops in @entity3 tuesday 's move put president @entity88 , who beat @entity62 in a springtime presidential election , on track to make good on his campaign - trail promise to withdraw all @entity1 combat troops from @entity3 by the end of this year			1
hundreds of @entity1 troops were expected to fly out of @entity7 in the coming weeks			0
@entity1 has been preparing such a handover for months , recently focusing on training @entity3 forces instead of having @entity1 troops lead patrols in @entity21			0
@entity1 had officially transferred the first command to the @entity100 there in autumn last year , with @entity1 troops in a backup role			0
' today , the @entity3 forces are capable of planning and conducting security operations in an autonomous way , ' the @entity1 military said in a statement tuesday			0
@entity108 , a spokesman for the international coalition , said it thanked @entity1 for its contribution and suggested the pullout would have no negative impact on allied operations			0
' because the @entity1 departure is part of the natural transition from coalition - led operations to @entity100 assuming complete responsibility for the security of their country , we do n't expect it to impact our operations , ' he said in @entity7			0
@entity1 plans to maintain 1,500 troops in @entity3 next year , mainly to repatriate equipment deployed during the 11 - year @entity1 military role as part of the allied intervention in @entity3			2
about 500 will help train and support @entity3 forces , and help run @entity7 's airport .			0
