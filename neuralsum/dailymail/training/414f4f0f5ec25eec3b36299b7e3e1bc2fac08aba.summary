@entity0 grew up in @entity1 supporting @entity2 but he became the latest new face to provide encouragement for @entity6 ’s fresh start by repeating @entity8 ’s feat at @entity9 of scoring a century in his second test			1
there is no question that @entity0 is fully entitled to appear for his mother ’s country after making his life in @entity6 and turning his back on overtures from @entity2 when it became clear last year that he would play at the highest level			1
yet nationality is a perennially thorny issue in cricket and it will not go unnoticed that the two young , talented batsmen who put @entity6 in a strong position in this second and final @entity10 both played for other countries at under - 19 level			2
only when cloud cover returned to @entity28 after tea and suddenly the ball nibbled around did @entity32 puncture @entity6 ’s day of dominance , taking four cheap wickets in the final session to keep themselves in the hunt for the second test			1
@entity56 , who resigned as national selector last winter , used to say he would always look into the eyes of any dual - nationality recruit to make sure they had the passion , desire and correct motivation to play for @entity6			2
well , if @entity56 had looked into @entity0 ’s eyes he would have seen a fiercely determined , old - fashioned opening batsman who is likely to be a prolific , if not always entertaining , member of this @entity6 team for years to come			2
to be at @entity28 was to almost step back in time to the days when @entity70 would have the locals in thrall to his accumulative methods and a scoring rate of just under three runs an over would be positively giddy			0
@entity0 is a friend and contemporary of @entity77 but he could hardly be more different , both as a man and a batsman			2
his steady , unspectacular style and under - stated manner are almost an antidote to the excesses of the modern game			0
his efforts were certainly appreciated by this knowledgeable @entity87 crowd as @entity0 ’s 127 in an @entity6 reply of 320 for six to @entity32 ’s 257 , a lead of 63 after two days , was greeted with rich , appreciative applause			1
at the forefront of those who rose to @entity0 were his parents			0
late drama : @entity95 took @entity97 's wicket late on as @entity6 's middle order dropped like flies late drama : @entity100 celebrates as @entity101 is dismissed to leave @entity6 wobbling born in @entity103 to an @entity105 father and an @entity107 mother from @entity108 , the 24 - year - old plays for @entity110			1
@entity2 batsman @entity111 took @entity0 ‘ for a few pints ’ in a bid to persuade him to play for the @entity105 rather than @entity6			1
played at under - 19 level for @entity2 before becoming eligible to play for @entity6 in 2013			2
in 2009 , he hit a maiden first - class century in his debut season against @entity117 at @entity9			0
in 2012 , he became the first batsman in history to score a first - class hundred in @entity6 in the month of march with a ton against @entity122			0
was the leading run - scorer in the 2013 @entity124 ( 933 runs at an average of 62.06 )			0
made his @entity6 test debut against @entity32 on june 12 , scoring 1 and 19			2
his dad ‘ @entity131 ’ @entity130 coaches at the @entity50 and flew from @entity1 ahead of the first test to watch his son ’s first steps as a ‘ genuine ’ @entity107 and watch on intently at @entity28			0
how @entity6 needed the graft and grind of @entity0 , who moved to @entity137 six years ago and made his name with @entity110 before scoring five centuries last winter for the @entity140 to confirm his allegiance			1
he had seen his captain @entity142 , desperately in need of a hundred with pressure growing on his captaincy , add just three runs to his overnight 14 before falling to his old failing — a full delivery just outside off - stump			1
@entity6 could not afford any more cheap wickets if they were to build a score that would define this decisive @entity151 and they had the perfect pair in @entity0 and @entity51 to steady the ship and chip away at @entity32			1
@entity154 , the @entity6 managing director , wants the team to be positive at all times but , with the @entity28 conditions still giving assistance to the @entity161 attack , there was a need for good old - fashioned digging in			0
that is @entity0 ’s game and here he shrugged off the uncertainty of his nervy debut last week to unfurl his favoured cover drives and that strength off his hip that has raised , perhaps prematurely , comparisons with @entity172			0
pulling rank : @entity97 hit 64 after @entity32 wilted in the @entity87 heat in focus : @entity8 continued where he left off at @entity9 , scoring 74 on his home ground @entity0 is hardly a product of the @entity180 generation but he did show that he could hit high and straight , notably when he lofted @entity181 for a straight six and held his perfectly straight bat in a textbook pose			1
by that time @entity0 had passed three figures and had also lost @entity51 , who was not as fluent as in his lord ’s century but again showed enough quality to fully justify the faith of a new selection panel who are yet to put a foot wrong			2
@entity8 was actually given out lbw on 31 to @entity181 but what appeared an optimistic review against @entity196 ’s decision was proved justified when technology suggested the ball would miss the adopted @entity200 ’s leg stump			0
he also could have been run out or caught at short leg before @entity100 , doing the job his frontline seamers struggled to accomplish , put the ball in the right place to take the edge of @entity51 ’s bat and dismiss him for 74			0
caught wanting : @entity142 can only watch as @entity208 competes his dismissal off the bowling of @entity211 at sixes and sevens : since scoring a century against @entity214 at @entity28 last summer , @entity142 has scored 585 runs in 23 innings at an average of 25.4 when @entity0 followed him , bowled through the gate by @entity219 , the stage was set for @entity97 in his 100th test and he did not disappoint initially as he raced along to 64 to take @entity6 beyond @entity32 ’s below - par total			1
he looked certain to celebrate his landmark in the grand manner until @entity95 strangled him down the leg side			0
when @entity101 quickly followed a window of opportunity had suddenly opened for @entity32			0
@entity228 fell to another loose drive as three @entity107 wickets fell for two runs but @entity232 and @entity233 just about got through to the close to keep @entity6 on top .			1

@entity0 reached 127 , with the hosts 63 runs ahead by the close of play
@entity8 was out for 74 , while @entity97 hit 64
@entity6 lost three wickets for two runs , with @entity97 , @entity101 and @entity244 falling late in the day
captain @entity142 made just 17 with his poor run of form continuing
