admission : @entity1 said some of the targets were ' written on the back of envelopes ' @entity8 chiefs have paid over the odds for contracts in order to meet self - imposed diversity targets , a senior official has admitted			1
@entity1 , head of inclusion at this summer ’s olympics , confessed that some targets were ‘ written on the back of an envelope ’ – but stressed that they had to be honoured			1
the comments are likely to infuriate those angry about the cost of attending the @entity22			1
they may also concern mps , who last month expressed fears that the @entity8 will go way over its current budget of £ 9.3billion			1
the predicted cost of the @entity22 when @entity29 won the bid in 2005 was £ 2.37billion			1
addressing a diversity conference in @entity32 , mr @entity1 – formerly of gay equality organisation @entity33 – cited an @entity38 ‘ volunteer selection centre ’ as an example of officials shunning the cheapest option			1
he said the successful bidder was a ‘ little more expensive ’ but had ‘ guaranteed to do all the work we needed to make the venue more accessible ’			1
mr @entity1 said : ‘ all this stuff we ’d said in 2005 to get the @entity22			1
some of it was written on the back of an envelope , quite frankly			1
we then had to deliver it			1
’ the @entity50 and @entity51 graduate also claimed that @entity29 was an ‘ urban desert ’ before @entity29 ’s successful @entity8 bid			1
‘ i think if any of you go to @entity29 , or have been to @entity29 , or know @entity29 well , the @entity53 of @entity29 is transformed , ’ he said			2
‘ and it ’s been a real physical transformation			2
‘ an area that was an urban desert [ with ] burnt - out cars , wild cats , unexploded bombs from @entity61 , poisoned soil , dirty water			2
has now become a really really cleaned - up , thriving community with affordable housing , lifetime homes , medical centres , [ and ] new hospitals as well as venues built for legacy			2
’ mr @entity1 said the privately - run @entity71 ( @entity71 ) had convinced more than 60 businesses to set up a guaranteed interview scheme for disabled people			2
‘ that for me is systemic change which has benefits , rather than token diversity			0
’ politically correct : volunteers at the @entity22 are also being offered advice on how to deal with cross-dressing members of the public he also revealed that car - makers that signed contracts with @entity71 must make vehicles adaptable for disabled drivers			0
‘ it ’s going to be quite nice in @entity29 to see @entity89 being driven around by disabled folks , ’ he said			0
other contract recipients include a minority - owned film company in @entity29 ; the @entity93 , which will offer interpretation services ; a company run by visually impaired people that will provide cleaning products ; and an @entity100 - owned bus company			0
in an interview with a @entity103 newspaper , mr @entity1 revealed he has consulted with gay former @entity105 player @entity104 on the inclusion of gay and lesbian athletes at the @entity22 , and worked with @entity111 @entity110 champion @entity109 on accessibility for disabled athletes and spectators			0
‘ the @entity29 vision will definitely empower change , enhancing the hiring of disabled people , including gays and lesbians and dealing with homophobia in sport , bringing cultural communities together , ’ he said			0
‘ we ’re not going to solve the world ’s problems , but we are going to use the power of the games for change			0
’ last september , the @entity129 revealed that volunteers at the @entity22 are being offered advice on how to deal with cross-dressing members of the public			0
they have been told that if confronted by a man wearing a dress , they should direct him to both the men ’s and women ’s toilets to avoid causing offence			0
volunteers have also been issued with a list of words or terms they should not use while on duty			0
banned terms include carer or helper , to be replaced with personal assistant or support worker			0
staff must also avoid ‘ patronising ’ young people , the guidelines state , adding that it would be wrong to say ‘ young man ’ .			0
