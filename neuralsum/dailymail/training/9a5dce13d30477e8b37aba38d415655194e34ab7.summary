by @entity0 published : 09:53 est , 1 april 2013 updated : 01:33 est , 2 april 2013 a @entity2 councillor was condemned as ‘ egotistical ’ and ‘ arrogant ’ yesterday for naming a park after his son without permission			1
@entity6 had the sign declaring the land ‘ @entity9 ’ erected after helping to arrange play equipment for it			2
last week council officials discovered that he did not have permission to rename the land and had the sign taken down at the weekend			1
' arrogant ' : @entity6 ( left ) erected a sign emblazoned ' @entity9 ' at the public space a defiant mr @entity6 said he was ‘ very annoyed ’ , insisting that the honour was deserved as his eight - year - old son @entity18 had been a member of a council ‘ planning team ’ working on the park in @entity22 , @entity23			1
but @entity24 , @entity25 leader at @entity26 , said : ‘ it just shows you the arrogance of the @entity30			0
i ’m not surprised , but i am disappointed			0
’ he added : ‘ i believe that for someone to have something named after them , they should have done long service			0
‘ if he has just named it because he can , when there ’s so many volunteers who have gone unnoticed , then it ’s absolutely egotistical			0
i ’m surprised at councillor @entity6			0
‘ it ’s no wonder councillors get a bad name when they do things like this – we all get tarred with the same brush			0
’ he suggested that the park should have been named by the community , for example through a competition at local schools			2
‘ no individual should be able to make that decision , ’ said mr @entity24			0
a resident who lives near the park added : ‘ we were all a bit surprised when the name went up			2
' @entity9 ' : the councillor did not seek permission to name the public park after his son ‘ i think it was just a case of a councillor who likes everyone to know who he is and what he has done			1
’ but mr @entity6 , a cabinet member for @entity26 , yesterday defended his actions			0
he said his son @entity18 was part of a local youth council that helped choose play equipment for the run - down park ’s opening in 2011			1
the father of three , who hails from @entity77 in @entity78 , said he had used £ 3,525 of his council funding allocation to buy play equipment for the park and the sign			1
‘ there was no equipment in the park , so the local youth council did research on the equipment they wanted , ’ he said			1
‘ my son was part of that planning team and the group decided to call it @entity9 after him			1
it was quite nice of them to do that , and i said i would not object			0
’ demanding that the sign be put back up , he added : ‘ i ’m very annoyed			2
i invested in that park when there was no play equipment there			2
’ a spokesman for the council said : ‘ there was an unauthorised sign put up in the park which has now been removed			1
we have got no record of consent ever being given for any such sign to be put up in this park			1
’ it added that mr @entity6 ‘ is welcome to collect it if he wishes ’ .			0
