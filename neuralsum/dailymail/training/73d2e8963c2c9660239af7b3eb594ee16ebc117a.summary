mr @entity0 , speaking passionately at the impromptu gathering outside the @entity19 , also suggested that he was moving on swiftly from any alliance formed between parties in the lead up to the @entity24 referendum			1
@entity38 and mr @entity0 have clashed over how to proceed , with the prime minister determined to make changes to ensure ' @entity42 votes for @entity42 laws ' at @entity35 as part of a package of reform - something that labour fear will erode the influence of their @entity24 mps			0

' and this week we show how we are going to change @entity7 so it works for everyday working people and not just a privileged few at the top			1
addressing activists , the @entity2 leader said the country ' does n't work for most working people ' ' our plan starts today by showing how we build the homes our country needs , because so many young families are struggling to get on the housing ladder			1
