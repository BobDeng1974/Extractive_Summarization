by @entity0 a woman has lost an incredible 19.8st - more than half her 43st body weight - following dangerous weight loss surgery morbidly obese @entity4 , 35 , developed a complex and deeply unhealthy relationship with food after being raped at the age of 26 , using food to comfort herself and her size as a way of protecting herself from the world			1
but after her son @entity13 , six , told her that all his classmates called her fat , @entity4 made the decision to lose weight for the sake of her children			1
@entity4 's 43st weight meant she was mainly confined to her bed and in near constant pain @entity4 dropped from 43.2st ( left ) to 23.4st ( left ) in the course of 12 months after opting for risky bypass surgery the mother - of - two , from @entity26 in @entity27 , had tipped the scales at a staggering 606lbs ( 43.2st ) and suffered from numerous health problems that left her bed bound and unable to care for her children			1
she could barely walk and spent most of her days in bed while her mother @entity32 cooked her meals and cared for the children			1
speaking on @entity37 's my 600lb life ahead of the operation , @entity4 said : ' i ’m disgusted with myself			1
if i could cut it off i would			0
' there ’s a lot of things in my life that ’s hard and because of my size i do n’t do much of anything			2
basically my day in stuck in the bed			2
' i ’m in constant pain			1
my weight has worn down the cartilage in my knees so when i walk it is literally bone on bone			0
my back hurts because my stomach hangs so far down			2
' @entity4 used food as an emotional crutch and her size as a means of protection against the world worse , @entity4 also said her children , @entity13 and @entity63 , were missing out on being raised by their mother with grandmother @entity32 doing the bulk of the childcare instead			1
‘ she does everything for them , ' explained @entity4			1
' but she ’s getting too old to be doing what she ’s doing - i should be taking care of her			2
' i want to be there for my children			2
i want to see them play sports and see them grow up			0
' ever since i can remember i have been overweight , ' she continued			0
' it did n’t really dawn on me about my size until when i was 13 years old i stepped on the scales and it read 187.5lb [ 13st 4lbs ] but i just brushed it off			2
when i graduated high school i was 352lb [ 25st 1lb ]			0
' my food is an addiction			2
food does n’t judge me whether i ’m happy or sad , angry , upset - i always have food			2
@entity88 has always been my safe haven			0
' but although she 'd always been big , the trigger for the weight gain that took her to a massive 43st 2lb was a traumatic rape at the age of 26			0
after becoming pregnant by her rapist , @entity4 then suffered a miscarriage and in the aftermath , began eating more ' to feel safe and unattractive ' to men			1
@entity4 also felt her size meant she was missing out on raising daughter @entity63 and son @entity13 , who had to interact with her on her bed although @entity4 's mother prepared most of her food , @entity4 , who admitted she ate 6 times a day , was able to cook for herself sitting down ‘ when i was 26 i was raped and i got pregnant from the rape and had a miscarriage , ' she revealed			1
' i was heavy , but afterwards i just got heavier			0
i felt that if i got more unattractive no man would want to touch me and i would be safe			0
' it made me not care			2
i did n’t care about anyone else 's feelings			1
after i eat i feel disgusted , angry at myself			0
i beat myself up about it			0
’ despite her size - and her inability to cook for herself - @entity4 's mother @entity32 says she felt unable to deny her requests for food			1
‘ i ’m helping her to stay like she is because it is hard to serve her and tell her , " that ’s all you can have " , ' she explained			0
' i always end up giving into her … she ’s my child			0
’ with dieting made difficult by her situation , @entity4 travelled to @entity127 to consult leading bariatric surgeon , dr @entity128 in a bid to lose weight			1
@entity4 shopping using a scooter with her mother @entity32 ( left ) and daughter @entity63 ( right ) @entity4 travelled to @entity127 to meet with dr @entity135 , who described her condition as ' critical ' and undergo surgery demanding that she make an effort to change her unhealthy habits on her own before undergoing surgery , dr @entity135 instructed @entity4 – who admitted she ate at least six times a day - to lose 20lbs in a month at home			1
‘ @entity4 ’s conditional is critical			1
if she does n’t start to lose weight , i do n’t think she will live another five years , ’ he warned			0
the surgery , which left her with a stomach the size of a boiled egg , was a success , although @entity4 admits she did have trouble adapting to her new diet at first			1
‘ changing your eating habits is hard , especially when your whole life you have turned to food to make you happy , ’ she explained			0
despite disappointing initial weight loss , @entity4 's surgery goes ahead , with her son admitting to her at her bedside that he is teased at school over her size @entity4 's weight led to complications during surgery , but it was a success ; reducing the size of @entity4 's stomach to about the same as a boiled egg despite a bumpy start to sticking to her diet , @entity4 eventually becomes committed , walking more and even starting at a gym a year later , @entity4 has lost almost half her body weight , and can now walk around the supermarket instead of having to ride on a scooter , and can help her son get ready for school in the morning			1
‘ a year ago i was at the lowest point in my life , ' she says			0
' i will never forget who that 600lb person was ; i will always love her but i sure wo n’t miss her			0
‘ now i have a world of possibilities and i just ca n’t wait to start living my life			0
' @entity4 appears on my 600lb life , tonight at 9pm on @entity37			1
