by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity2 has urged critics to give new @entity4 team principal @entity5 time to prove himself despite his lack of experience in @entity8			1
@entity2 lost one of his closest allies in @entity11 this week as the @entity12 tendered his resignation on monday in the wake of the team 's poor start to the season , and with just one trophy to show for his six years in charge			1
in his place , president @entity20 has opted for 43 - year - old @entity22 , who up until this week was president and ceo of @entity24			2
presentation : @entity2 , pictured with team - mate @entity26 in @entity27 on thursday , believes new @entity4 chief @entity5 must be given time to prove his credentials making his point : @entity2 , sitting next to @entity31 , gestures at the drvers ' press conference in @entity35 whilst possessing considerable management skills , @entity5 lacks any knowledge regarding @entity8 and will quickly need to bring himself up to speed			1
' we need to give him time , to see how he settles , ' said @entity2 , when asked about @entity5 ahead of this weekend 's @entity40			1
' it 's obviously too early to say whether he will be very good or very bad			0
' we need to make sure he has the facilities ready , all the technical stuff , that all the team are behind him to ensure he settles as fast as possible , to put him in a place where he feels comfortable			0
' and we 're obviously hoping he will be successful because we need to be honest with our situation , it 's not where we want to be , with a lot of room to improve			0
we need to be better in all areas			0
' gone : @entity11 handed in his resignation at the beginning of the week plane sailing : @entity2 arrives at @entity55 with girlfriend @entity56 as a good friend of @entity58 , @entity2 is naturally sorry to see him go as he said : ' @entity11 is a great man			1
' we ski together on the first of january in the mountains in @entity12 , and we still have a close relationship			1
' we 've been talking all week long , which will continue because we 've known each other for many years			1
' as a team principal he made good choices , did good things			1
' unfortunately we missed opportunities in 2010 and 2012 ( to win the title ) , and another in 2008 with @entity71 ( @entity72 ) , otherwise he could have had three championships in his pocket			0
' but he brought in @entity75 ( engineering director ) , @entity77 ( technical director ) and ( @entity26 ) @entity26 , and all the things people asked of him he gave to them			0
' but results in sport are important , and the pressure at @entity4 is big , so he has made his decision , which we respect			2
' it 's not easy when you have a very privileged position in a @entity8 team to be able to step back and say that maybe it 's better to move			0
' he did it for for @entity4 to improve , and in their best interests , and that is something we can not forget , and we have to respect his decision			2
' it 's not as if in this race we will improve by a second because it is not as if @entity11 was doing the front wing , the rear wing or whatever			2
' so we need to wait , to see what we can improve , to help all the team to make us stronger and to regain some of the success from the past			0
