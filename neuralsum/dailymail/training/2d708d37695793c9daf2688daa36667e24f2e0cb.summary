in a witness statement to the @entity30 she said : ' i was made redundant because i had had a baby , taken maternity leave and suffered illness as a result of the birth			2
' ms @entity1 gave birth on 5 may 2011 to a baby girl through emergency caesarean section , but there were complications and both ms @entity1 and her newborn needed continued hospital treatment			1
the @entity46 - born lawyer underwent two gruelling operations to repair organs that had been damaged during the childbirth			0
initially , she hoped to return after six months because she would be eligible for a bonus			0
but she claims after she told bosses she was suffering complications from the surgery they selected her for redundancy			1
she was called to a meeting on 3 november 2011 and told she faced redundancy			1
in her witness statement ms @entity1 said : ' i felt ambushed			1
' i had no one accompanying me , was still not fully well following the complications that had followed the birth of my second child , and at the meeting that i had asked for to discuss my return to work i was suddenly being faced with what appeared to be a pre-prepared meeting to tell me that i was redundant			1
' and the @entity67 and @entity69 graduate said that she had been made to feel sidelined by the firm before she had even taken her maternity leave			2
the firm moved to the @entity72 where offices were handed out depending on status , but the heavily pregnant lawyer was given a windowless room because she was about to have her baby			2
she claims her boss made the decision because she was only going to have to ‘ sit in there ’ for 4 - 6 weeks before having her baby			2
she claims after she told bosses she was suffering complications from the surgery they selected her for redundancy ( posed by models ) ms @entity1 told the tribunal : ' i strongly believed i was being treated unfairly and unfavourably regarding this issue because of my imminent maternity leave			1
' while on leave she discussed her return with her boss @entity93 and other senior staff , but received no indication that there were any problems until she told them about her surgical complications			2
she said : ' @entity93 said it was important that i should concentrate on getting well and , as and when , i was ready i would be welcomed back to the department and i was a valued member of the team			0
' but mr @entity93 left the company while she was away			0
' i felt tricked , cheated and betrayed ' - @entity1 during her employment tribunal during the redundancy meeting ms @entity1 wondered aloud why she was being got rid of and mentioned it felt like ' anyone who is not white will be fired ' by her boss @entity108			1

i was shocked and frightened by the prospect as i had not budgeted for it			0
' she added : ' needless to say , i felt tricked , cheated and betrayed			0
i could not shake off the notion that @entity108 did this deliberately to victimise me since i challenged his decision on redundancy and had not ‘ gone quietly ’			0
' the firm also told her that she would only get her full redundancy pay - the equivalent of seven weeks wages - if she agreed not to bring any claim against them , it is alleged			2
she was formally dismissed on redundancy grounds on 29 november last year			0
she is suing the firm for unfair dismissal , pregnancy , maternity and sex discrimination , indirect age discrimination and victimisation			0
@entity2 strongly deny the allegations and in a statement to the tribunal they claim she was made redundant because there was n’t enough work			1

' they deny ' that there was any link between the claimant ’s provisional selection and her maternity leave or related illness			0
