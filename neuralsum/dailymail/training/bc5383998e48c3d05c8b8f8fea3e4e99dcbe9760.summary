pot of gold : the elaborate @entity2 urn which was initially valued on the @entity3 at £ 10,000 it was a wedding gift that for years was commandeered as a goalpost by his children – so @entity8 was stunned when this ornament was valued at £ 10,000 on the @entity3 in 1991			1
but the retired farmer decided to keep hold of the antique for a just little longer ... and it turned out to be a wise decision			2
it has now sold at auction for a staggering £ 668,000 , the most expensive sale price of any item valued on the long - running show			1
mr @entity8 , 68 , was given the ‘ jardiniere ’ by his parents , who picked it up as part of a £ 100 ‘ job lot ’ of antiques in 1946			1
unbeknown to the family , it was a @entity28 ‘ @entity32 ’ enamel and bronze ornament made in 1874 by the renowned @entity30 for the @entity31			2
over the years his children kicked footballs at it in their dining room , as thanks to its long thin stand it measured up at 5ft tall , making it a perfect goalpost			0
mr @entity8 , from @entity41 near @entity42 , first took the jardiniere to @entity44 ’s @entity3 , where @entity45 valued it at £ 10,000			1
he then kept it for more than 20 years , before eventually deciding to sell it at auction at @entity49 in @entity50			1
after giving money to his family and paying for holidays and a @entity54 , mr @entity8 returned to the @entity3 23 years later to tell his story			1
' my brother and sister never took an interest in it but i really liked it , and when i got married my mother gave it to us as a present			0
stunned : @entity8 , left , with expert @entity45 and the valuable ornament on the programme in 1991 return : @entity8 , centre , returned to the show to share his story with @entity45 , left , and @entity58 ‘ we kept it in the dining room and our son used to use it as a goalpost			1
it was only when i took it to the @entity3 that i realised it was valuable			0
even then i kept it for over 20 years because my mother always loved it			2
‘ but i realised i could n’t just leave it to one person , so decided to sell it and share the proceeds			0
' the auctioneer started the bidding at £ 100,000 and i just thought “ blimey ”			0
then it kept going and i was getting redder and redder in the face			0
’ but despite the urn ’s high sale price , mr @entity45 insisted he did n’t undervalue the pot in 1991 , saying : ‘ back then , there was not the same demand … it ’s a market that has sprung out of nowhere			2
' my estimate may seem on the low side , but the auction estimate was £ 60,000 to £ 80,000			0
so it made half a million more than the auction estimate			0
