by @entity0 an elderly woman who set out on an overseas holiday to visit family in @entity4 ended up with a broken leg before she even made it to her home country			1
on april 4 @entity8 , 72 , was travelling with her son , daughter - in - law , and her two grandchildren on a @entity13 flight from @entity14 when she had a fall on the travelator about an hour before departure			1
paramedics assisted her and ms @entity8 was cleared to continue her flight , after she made an agreement with the airline to have wheelchair assistance for the entire journey to @entity23			1
the 72 - year - old fractured her tibia and tore ligaments in her right leg and is now seeking $ 250,000 compensation @entity8 was refused a wheelchair while leaving a @entity13 flight which resulted in her breaking her leg however , according to @entity35 solicitor @entity34 his client was not given the support she needed for the entirety of her trip			1
after being wheeled off the plane and onto the next one during a stopover in @entity41 , ms @entity8 was then asked to disembark the plane at her final destination on her own			2
the statement of claim says that ' when the @entity47 was on board the aircraft ... she stood up un-assisted following the refusal of a flight attendant to provide a wheelchair or manual assistance			2
' ' when she got to the other end she waited for all the passengers to clear the plane , ' mr @entity34 told the @entity58			0
' she was told something to the effect of " there is n't a wheelchair you 'll have to get that at the exit "			2
' but the elderly woman was not able to walk on her own and when she stood up to leave the plane her right leg , which she had injured earlier , collapsed beneath her			0
' as soon as she stood up she fell back to the ground , her right knee and leg collapsed , she fractured her tibia , and there was ligament damage , ' mr @entity34 said			2
ms @entity8 was forced to extend her stay in @entity4 while she underwent daily rehabilitation this week , court documents were filed over the incident requesting compensation from @entity13 to the sum of $ 250,000			1

@entity13 told the @entity58 the company ' is aware of the incident and as litigations are underway will not be commenting further '			0
when ms @entity8 arrived in @entity4 it was originally thought she may need to undergo surgery for her injuries , but instead had intensive physiotherapy each day trying to get her to be able to walk			1
she was forced to extend her trip beyond her initial two weeks , only returning to @entity85 on july 14 so she would n't lose her visa privileges			0
when asked about the $ 250,000 compensation claim , mr @entity34 described the figure as the ' best estimate given how early on she is in her recovery '			0
