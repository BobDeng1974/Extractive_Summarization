@entity7 have already provided the issuing banks with the affected account numbers and assured customers they would not be responsible for fraudulent purchases			1
investigation : @entity6 and @entity7 are said to have notified all of their customers of the security breach the companies , which are the two largest global credit card processors , said the issue stemmed from a third - party vendor , reportedly @entity34 , and not their own internal systems			1
@entity37 - based company @entity34 are being named as the third party processor where the breach occurred			1

though millions of @entity5 cardholders could be affected , it does not necessarily mean their cards were used fraudulently but that the cardholder 's information was accessed			0

first they are aggregated and sent to a server before the card information reaches a processor for authorization			0
the processor then sends the authorization request to the bank who check the details ( if it is a legitimate account and if there is enough money to cover charge ) and then confirm the authorization back to the processor			2
the current breach is believed to have occurred at the central aggregation point where card information is calculated			0
the companies ' statements came after the blog @entity86 reported that @entity6 and @entity7 have been alerting banks across the @entity5 about a ' massive ' breach that may affect more than ten million cardholders			1

' i 'm hearing now from two sources that investigators suspect @entity135 street gangs may be involved and that the fraud is focusing mostly on commercial credit and debit card accounts			1
' thousands of @entity5 banks that issue credit and debit cards receive daily alerts regarding breaches through a system referred to as @entity145 , said @entity146 , an analyst with @entity147			0

she believes the data is already being used on the street by identity thieves			2
she wrote on her blog : ' i ’ve spoken with folks in the card business who are seeing signs of this breach mushroom			0
looks like the hackers have started using the stolen card data more recently			0
' from what i hear , the breach involves a taxi and parking garage company in the @entity186 area , so if you ’ve paid a @entity186 cab in the last few months with your credit or debit card — be sure to check your card statements for possible fraud			2
