@entity0 has profusely apologized after an extremely graphic picture of a woman engaged in a sex act with a model @entity5 was tweeted to a customer who complained about her @entity8 flight			1
the young woman , @entity10 , tweeted directly to @entity0 early on monday morning that her flight to @entity12 had been delayed - demanding ' free stuff ' because her vacation was off to a bad start			2
in reply , the airlines official @entity19 account replied , ' we do n’t like to hear this , @entity10			0
please provide feedback to our customer relations team here , ' and attached a photograph of the nude woman out to its 418,000 followers this afternoon			0
' we apologize for an inappropriate image recently shared as a link in one of our responses			0
we ’ve removed the tweet and are investigating			0
' of course the tweet was deleted but spent 22 minutes online - enough time to cause a frenzy of sharing among incredulous users of the social media app. when reached for comment , @entity0 admited they were aware of the situation but could not explain it as of monday afternoon			1
incredulous : the public 's reaction to @entity0 staggering tweet ranged from humor to sympathy for whoever was responsible the replies to the offensive tweet ranged from laughter to outrage			2
it seems the tweet was originally sent as a bad joke to @entity64 and presumably someone at @entity0 tried to copy and paste it to send to a friend , but inadvertently tweeted it out to genuine customers			1
another unsatisfied customer : @entity0 sent the same picture to customer @entity72 after she complained about her late flight to @entity12 so so sorry : @entity0 rushed to control the damage from their outrageous tweet - but the damage was done it also appears that @entity0 tweeted the photo to multiple customers as their bungled response to the original tweet continued			1
the image in question was attached to a tweet sent to @ @entity85 at 1:59pm , 30 minutes before @entity0 sent out a tweet with the same image attached			1
@entity64 and @entity0 use the same social media tool , @entity88			1
the timing was particularly amusing since it overlapped with the announcement of the @entity92 winners and gained more traffic online			0
the tweet is even more embarrassing for @entity0 as they prepare for their merger with @entity64 which will create the world 's largest airline company			1
@entity0 eventually said sorry in full for the gross error			2
' we apologize for the inappropriate image we recently shared in a @entity19 response			2
our investigation has determined that the image was initially posted to our @entity19 feed by another user			2
we captured the tweet to flag it as inappropriate			0
' unfortunately the image was inadvertently included in a response to a customer			0
we immediately realized the error and removed our tweet			0
we deeply regret the mistake and we are currently reviewing our processes to prevent such errors in the future			0
' do you know who is responsible for the social media faux pas at @entity0 ? please phone the @entity32 at 212 775 8126 if you do			1
