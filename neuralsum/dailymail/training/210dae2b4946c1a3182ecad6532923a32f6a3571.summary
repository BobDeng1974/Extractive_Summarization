when last season saw @entity3 's @entity2 and @entity4 shun their trademark pop art prints in favour of @entity8 - worthy gowns , the fashion pack was caught flat - footed			1
luckily for print fans , their focus on @entity11 has n't lasted and this time around , the design duo opted for a quirky celebration of all that 's fabulous about @entity18 's rock n ' roll party scene			2
prints , metallics and some wonderfully wearable cashmere coats combined to make a / w14 one of their best collections to date			0
elegant : @entity3 's @entity18 rocker inspired look combined edgy styling with luxe fabrics the duo themselves described their muse as ‘ pale and very significant , swathed in a multitude of very necessary textures in her winter embrace ’			1
this translated as a catwalk awash with plenty of fur , powder pink silk catsuits , metallic leggings and lashings of edgy pvc			0
speaking ahead of their show at @entity18 's @entity45 last night , @entity2 told @entity46 : ‘ this season we ’ve gone very @entity18 and the models we ’ve chosen are all very @entity3			1
‘ they ’re models that have been with us for a long time , they ’ve grown up with @entity3 and we wanted to reconnect with them			2
‘ we ’ve been on lots of different journeys but this season , our @entity3 jean is back , our bomber jacket is back ; just pieces that we ’ve missed			2
’ modern metallics : the label 's oversized roses got a modern update courtesy of jazzy silver and gold tailoring pastel perfection : the lilac trend looks set to continue into next autumn if @entity3 have their way speaking about the @entity3 woman for a / @entity76 , @entity2 said : ‘ it ’s not very @entity78 , it ’s our @entity18 vibe			1
i would n’t say she lives in the city , i ’d say she lives more in the countryside but she ’s definitely rock ‘ n ’ roll			0
‘ she ’s a party girl but she likes weekends away in the country			0
’ their signature print for the season came in the form of what they describe as ‘ a kind of beauty and the beast rose ’			0
@entity2 , who was born in @entity93 and brought up in @entity94 , and @entity4 , who hails from the @entity95 , took their signature floral motif and turned up the volume , splashing across sumptuous satin in a dirty lilac hue			0
‘ it ’s got that really edgy feel but it ’s still a luxury fabric , ’ explained @entity2			0
dapper : made in @entity105 's @entity104 looked sharp in a sky blue suit and a cool pair of specs glamorous : tv presenter @entity110 and model @entity109 upped the fashion ante front row highlights included a floor length velvet number , which @entity2 admitted she had a ‘ bit of a crush on ’ , as well as high shine pvc bombers and a fur trimmed catsuit			1
the duo , who celebrated after the show at their favourite haunt , the @entity121 at @entity122 , revealed they ’d love to see @entity128 take centre stage in one of their designs			0
while the songstress was absent this season , the front row was occupied by a galaxy of stars , among them made in @entity105 's @entity104 and model - turned - actress , @entity109			1
but while the front row caught the eye , they could n't compete with the clothes : @entity3 's print - heavy greatest hits collection proving the real star of the show .			1
