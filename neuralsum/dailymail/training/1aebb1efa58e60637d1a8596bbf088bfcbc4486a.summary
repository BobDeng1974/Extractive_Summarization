the @entity0 could be completely free of ice in just 40 years as a result of global warming , one of the world 's leading climate change experts has warned			1
@entity8 winner professor @entity7 said there is evidence that temperatures are rising four times faster in the frozen region than the rest of the planet			1
this means that there will only be open water in the polar region by the 2050s , with nothing more than a few floating icebergs at the @entity22 , according to the @entity24 academic			1
alarming : the @entity0 could be completely free of ice in just 40 years as a result of global warming , one of the world 's leading climate change experts has warned			1
this map shows rates of erosion on the @entity0 coast , with the fastest rates marked in red professor @entity7 , from the @entity38 in @entity39 , gave his stark warning during a lecture in the @entity42 - the coldest part of @entity24			1
he forecasts that the region will see temperature rises of up to 7 ° c within a century			1
‘ for several reasons , the @entity0 climate change is more intense and faster than in other regions			1
there is a reduction in snow and ice cover , which has a protective function , ’ he said			0
‘ on average over the last year , the minimum area of sea ice has decreased from 5.4 to 5.3 million square kilometres [ two million square miles ]			0
over the past 10 years , the reduction of sea ice in the @entity0 was by 13.7 per cent			1
shocking pictures from @entity60 ( one is pictured ) show the collapse of buildings due to melting permafrost			1
according to environmentalists , as the snow and ice melts , the ability of the @entity0 region to reflect heat back into space is reduced and the rate of global warming is accelerated once more @entity8 winner professor @entity7 ( pictured ) said there is evidence that temperatures are rising four times faster in the frozen region than the rest of the planet ‘ by the middle of the century it may be that the @entity0 will be completely ice free			1
’ environmentalists and climate change scientists have long known about the potential disaster in the @entity0 as a result of rising global temperatures			1
the @entity42 region is experiencing climate change at a rapid rate and a 1884 map ( pictured ) shows @entity0 islands that have already vanished the sea ice is already at the lowest ever level recorded , with the @entity95 warning that a rise of just 2 ° c would be enough to melt the remaining floes			1
as well as rising sea waters , climate change could threaten delicate ecosystems and marine life			2
according to environmentalists , as the snow and ice melts , the ability of the @entity0 region to reflect heat back into space is reduced and the rate of global warming is accelerated once more			1
this could spark increasing numbers of forest fires and unpredictable storms and , at worst , bring a halt to the @entity113 which warms @entity114			0
the @entity42 , also known as @entity42 , is experiencing climate change at a quicker rate than other parts of the world , @entity115 reported			0
a map of the region from 1884 is already radically different to today 's , with @entity0 islands having vanished under rising sea waters			1
professor @entity7 predicts overall increases of about 7 ° c by next century in @entity24 's frozen north			1
shocking pictures from @entity60 highlighted by the academic show the collapse of buildings due to melting permafrost			1
in 2007 , as part of an @entity133 , he was awarded the @entity8 for research on the impact of global warming , and is considered one of the world 's most eminent experts on the subject			2
he said : ‘ if the global temperature got warmer by 0.85 ° c in 100 years , in @entity42 the winter temperature will have increased by 3.5 ° c. professor @entity7 said : ‘ if the global temperature got warmer by 0.85 ° c in 100 years , in @entity42 the winter temperature will have increased by 3.5 ° @entity147 ' this picture shows s house destroyed by melting ice on @entity150 - the largest river system flowing to the @entity0 as well as erosion ( areas of which are marked on this map ) , climate change has been blamed for the series of unexplained craters appearing throughout @entity24 ‘ that is , global warming here is four times faster			1
according to our forecasts , the temperature in the north will increase by six to seven degrees by the 2100s			2
’ other scientists have already speculated that global warming could be partly responsible for the series of unexplained craters appearing throughout @entity24			0
they believe warming air is melting thick permafrost , leading to the accumulation and release of volatile ‘ fire ice ’ gases which then explode to create the giant craters			2
almost two thirds of the @entity24 land mass lies within a permafrost zone and there are concerns that any melting of this could cause potential problems for infrastructure , such as buildings in cities and pipelines			1
‘ projected changes in the permafrost seriously threaten the @entity24 economy , primarily due to the increased risk of damage to the infrastructure of the @entity193 , ’ professor @entity7 said			1
the @entity195 - based @entity194 said it is vital to pay attention to environmental changes at the top of the world			0
‘ the @entity0 is global warming ’s canary in the coal mine			2
most scientists view what is happening now in the @entity0 as a harbinger of things to come , ’ the council said			2
four new mysterious giant craters have appeared in the @entity60 permafrost in northern @entity24 , sparking fears that global warming may be causing gas to erupt from underground			2
scientists spotted the new holes , along with dozens of other smaller ones , in the same area as three other enormous craters that were spotted on the @entity220 last year			0
the craters are thought to be caused by eruptions of methane gas from the permafrost as rising rising temperatures causes the frozen soil to melt			1
it has sparked fears that the craters could become more common as climate change continues to warm and led to warnings that the area is facing a looming natural disaster			0
unexplained : the first of the new craters discovered , named @entity236 ( pictured above ) , shows signs of an huge eruption of gas			0
four new mysterious giant craters have appeared in the @entity60 permafrost in northern @entity24 , sparking fears that global warming may be causing gas to erupt from underground one of new craters , surrounded by at least 20 smaller holes , is just six miles from a major gas production plant			2
experts have predicted there could be up to 30 more are waiting to be discovered			0
scientists , however , are still largely baffled by the exact processes causing the craters			2
professor @entity252 , deputy director of the @entity254 - based @entity253 , part of the @entity256 , has called for ' urgent ' investigation of the new phenomenon amid safety fears			0
until now , the existence of only three @entity60 craters had been established when great caverns in the frozen landscape were spotted by passing helicopter pilots			0
' we know now of seven craters in the @entity0 area , ' professor @entity252 told @entity115			1
' five are directly on the @entity220 peninsula , one in @entity271 , and one is on the north of the @entity275 region , near the @entity277 peninsula			0
' we have exact locations for only four of them			0
the other three were spotted by reindeer herders			0
' but i am sure that there are more craters on @entity220 , we just need to search for them			0
i would compare this with mushrooms			0
' when you find one mushroom , be sure there are few more around			0
i suppose there could be 20 to 30 craters more			0
' two of the newly - discovered large craters - also known as funnels to scientists - have turned into lakes , revealed professor @entity252			0
' it is important not to scare people , but this is a very serious problem			0
we must research this phenomenon urgently to prevent possible disasters			0
' we can not rule out new gas emissions in the @entity0 and in some cases they can ignite			2

professor @entity7 said @entity0 temperatures are rising fast
this means that there will be open water in the polar region by the 2050s
forecasts that the region 's temperature will rise by 7 ° c within a century
melting permafrost is already causing damage to buildings in the region
