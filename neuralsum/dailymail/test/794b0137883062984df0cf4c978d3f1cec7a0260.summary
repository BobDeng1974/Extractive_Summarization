@entity0 will say today that allowing refugees into @entity8 ‘ could lead to half a million @entity2 extremists coming to our countries and posing a direct threat to our civilisation ’			1
the @entity10 leader will say the boatloads of people trying to get to the continent from @entity14 could provide a cover for jihadis wanting to do harm			1
mr @entity0 will make his comments in a debate at the @entity20 in @entity21 in the wake of more than 1,000 migrants drowning in the @entity24			1
a source close to mr @entity0 said he was taking time out from the campaign trail in @entity36 to focus the election debate on immigration			1
campaign bosses believe a provocative intervention could have the same effect as his controversial remarks on foreigners with @entity47 being treated in @entity36 – which were part of a so - called ‘ shock and awful ’ strategy to get attention and appeal to the party ’s ‘ core voters ’			2
mr @entity0 thinks his party could still get more than ten mps if he manages to cause a ‘ big shock ’ in the eight days before polling day			2
a senior @entity10 aide said : ‘ he needs to make a special intervention			1
this is a big moment in the campaign			0
‘ @entity62 and @entity63 do not want to talk about this because they know the whole issue hinges on @entity31 membership			0
‘ @entity0 is going to highlight how jihadis are entering @entity8 , getting @entity31 passports , and then are able to easily come to @entity36 because of the open - borders policy			1
' if there is going to be one country where these guys are going to head to , it is going to be us because of the @entity77 war and our involvement in @entity79 and against @entity80			0
’ mr @entity0 said yesterday he opposed @entity31 action to tackle migrant deaths in the @entity24 because it could lead to a common migration policy and let millions of people into @entity36			1
he added that the problem had the potential to be more damaging than the eurozone crisis			0
mr @entity0 will warn that if the @entity31 agrees to give refuge to migrants from @entity14 , it could lead to millions being given passports that allow them to move to @entity36 ‘ i think what is happening in @entity21 is far more significant than anything that has been said by any of the party leaders about immigration … during this campaign , ’ he said			2
‘ they utterly refuse to accept that we are no longer in control of our borders … ‘ i ’m quite certain @entity63 and @entity62 will try and ignore this , so i am going there [ @entity21 ] to engage in that debate and make sure they can not ignore it			2
’ he added : ‘ are we about to see one of the great @entity108 dreams come true … a common @entity31 immigration policy ? we currently have a net migration figure of 300,000			0
@entity112 knows what it could be if this happens			0
' potentially @entity31 passports are about to be given to a very large number of people and the @entity36 political class in @entity120 is powerless			0
’ mr @entity0 ’s speech could be his last in the @entity20 if he is elected mp for @entity123			1
on a campaign visit to @entity125 yesterday , he accused the @entity126 of being ‘ openly racist ’ , adding : ‘ the anti-english hostility … is totally extraordinary			0
