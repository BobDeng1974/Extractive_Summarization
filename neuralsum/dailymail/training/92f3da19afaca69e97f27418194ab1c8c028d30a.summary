the great thing for @entity2 fans is that their manager @entity3 has n’t just found @entity4 — he has found @entity5 ! @entity4 , the @entity7 club ’s in - house tv presenter , in theory , should be out of bounds			1
but @entity2 ’s @entity11 manager is n’t a great man for boundaries			1
en route to coaching @entity16 ’s capital club on @entity18 duty at @entity19 this week , he has been a tv presenter , a physio , a scout and you can also see footage of him on television playing guitar and singing			1
he sets his own rules and compares himself to @entity28			0
@entity2 manager @entity3 is preparing to face @entity19 in the @entity18 on tuesday @entity2 manager @entity3 is an eccentric boss who keeps himself busy and is in the @entity18 @entity3 was spotted out with @entity2 's in - house tv presenter @entity4 earlier in the week @entity4 is a beautiful 28 - year - old @entity30 presenter who was spotted at a ' romantic ' dinner @entity4 took a joint ‘ selfie ’ and published a unified message on @entity33 with @entity3 no sooner was the 50 - year - old in the door at @entity2 than he was causing ructions by banning those fans who turned up at the club ’s @entity40 training ground			1
he got there , in summer 2013 , to find that absolutely anyone who was at the training ground — media , youth prospects , parents , scouts , agents , ground staff and probably some of the club ’s notorious @entity51 — were milling around getting in the way of the 20 - odd players who were supposed to be bringing back the glory days			2
if @entity2 ’s strikers can hit the net with the same accuracy as @entity3 used in booting their backsides out of what is now ‘ his ’ domain , then look out @entity7 so , to another part of his domain , @entity4			1
she is a beautiful 28 - year - old @entity2 tv presenter			1
an @entity16 football newspaper thought they had a great splash when they snapped the coach and his club ’s tv channel anchor at a romantic dinner together			1
but , by the morning the scoop was published , the wind was rather stylishly taken out of their sails by @entity3 and @entity4 taking a joint ‘ selfie ’ and publishing a unified message on @entity33			1
@entity4 took to @entity33 to explain how @entity3 was very much a part of her ' private life ' @entity2 coach @entity3 walks on the field at the end of a @entity7 soccer match between @entity2 and @entity83 @entity2 coach @entity3 calls out to his players during a @entity7 soccer match between @entity2 and @entity83 there was wit in taking the ‘ we ’re - a - couple - leave - us - alone ’ photo at @entity91 ’s world - famous @entity89			1
when the @entity11 arrived at one of @entity96 ’s great underachieving clubs , they had just lost the @entity97 a few weeks earlier to bitter city rivals @entity98			0
such was the bucolic reaction that when he and his new squad were presented at the @entity102 , he was whistled and booed into office			0
‘ @entity3 who ? ’ was the sentiment			2
but their rampaging 17 - game unbeaten start to the @entity7 season , the alluring football @entity2 played , the fact he convinced @entity107 not to join @entity108 and the fact that he and @entity2 icon @entity110 got on famously have all that led not only to acceptance , but reverence			2
however , @entity2 did n’t have the necessary strength in depth to cope with injuries and the rigours of a long chase after the @entity123 machine			2
they finished second in the league and were knocked out of the cup by the winners , @entity127 ’s @entity126			0
@entity3 , manager of @entity2 , gives instructions during a @entity7 match on friday in @entity16 but @entity3 has a dream and it involves @entity5 — @entity5 , that is , manager of @entity134			1
the @entity136 giants were second in the @entity138 league , beaten finalists in the @entity140 and beaten in their national cup final two seasons ago			0
but they stormed back the next year to win the title , the cup and reached the @entity140 once again			0
‘ @entity134 has to be our model — we have a stronger squad now and we can also go one step further , ’ declared @entity3			2
this was his message to fans , players and media alike at the beginning of this season			0
also , presumably , to owner @entity158 — net worth over € 1bn and managing director of @entity162 fund managers @entity160 — given that there were new contracts for @entity165 and the now prolific @entity166 , plus the acquisition of several new signings including @entity169 , @entity170 , @entity171 and @entity172			0
little wonder spirits are high after another thunderous winning start to the season , including going joint top of @entity7 and that 5 - 1 thrashing of @entity178 in the first @entity18 group match			0
@entity169 , already a winner of this competition with @entity181 , reckons : ‘ i ’ve come into a great squad and a unified dressing room			0
@entity3 reminds me of @entity184			2
he wants us to dominate via possession			0
they have the same credo — results need to stem from good football			0
’ @entity2 's head coach @entity3 will be at the @entity191 on tuesday to face @entity19 ‘ @entity134 ( and their manager @entity5 ) has to be our model , ' says @entity7 's @entity2 boss @entity3			1

this week , @entity3 has been a tv presenter , a physio , a scout and you can also see footage of him on television playing guitar and singing
@entity2 manager was spotted with beautiful 28 - year - old @entity30 presenter , @entity4 , at a supposedly romantic dinner together
@entity19 welcome @entity2 to the @entity191 on tuesday night as the two clubs go head to head in the @entity211
