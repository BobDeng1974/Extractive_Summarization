' unitati christifidelium integre studentes quid iubet dominus ? orare semper , iustitiam factitare , amare probitatem , humiles @entity12 ambulare , ' the pontiff wrote			0
the pope ’s tweet meant : ' what does the @entity16 command to those wholly eager for the unity of those following @entity21 ? ' to always pray , to continually do justice , to love uprightness , to walk humbly with him , ' according to @entity26 scholar @entity25			1
baffled ? so were many @entity28 users			2
' @entity29 , nobody understands a word of @entity5 ! ' read one response on the online messaging service			1
the message was shorter and , arguably , more elegant in its original language - one of the reasons why latin - lovers want to conserve the tongue of ancient @entity39 , @entity1 foremost among them			2
the @entity41 , where even @entity43 bank machine transactions are available in @entity5 , is one of the last bastions of the language that gave rise to @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 and @entity52			0
in november the pope set up a new @entity41 department charged with promoting the study and use of the language within the @entity58 and beyond			0
known for his traditionalist leanings , the 85 - year old pontiff has also allowed a partial return of the old - style @entity62 that was phased out more than four decades ago			0

to keep the language updated , @entity41 produces a dictionary of modern words in the ancient tongue			0
' @entity76 ' is the vital word ' email ' , while ' brevissimae bracae femineae ' means hotpants			0
with just over 5,000 followers , the pope ’s @entity5 - language @entity28 account is the smallest of his eight profiles , through which he communicates with more than 2 million followers in languages including @entity85 and his native @entity86 .			1

the message was posted on pope @entity1 *'s* @entity28 account on *sunday*
he asked his followers to pray for unity among @entity4 and ' do justice '
