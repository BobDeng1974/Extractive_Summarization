misconduct : dr @entity1 , 45 , was cleared of criminal charges but sanctioned by a medical panel a doctor who secretly filmed a miniskirt - wearing woman as a ‘ reward ’ after a hard day ’s work has been found guilty of misconduct			1
dr @entity1 , 45 , used a camera hidden in an adapted satchel to take five minutes of covert footage as the woman walked through @entity13 in may last year			1
he was acquitted of criminal charges after prosecutors offered no evidence - but today a fitness to practise panel ruled his actions amounted to misconduct after hearing they were ' sexually motivated '			1
the father - of - three , a former @entity22 medic who served in @entity23 and @entity24 in the late 1990s , confessed to a ten - year ‘ compulsion ’ that led him to film women as a ‘ reward ’ in times of stress			1
during the police investigation @entity1 admitted he had filmed women before and said he had other images at home , the panel in @entity36 heard			2
but the married doctor , from @entity38 , near @entity13 , was acquitted of outraging public decency after the @entity40 offered no evidence against him			1
police found other clandestine video recordings on his home computer , but no charges were brought , the panel heard			2
during a trust investigation @entity1 admitted that this type of behaviour happened the ‘ majority of the time once or twice a week ’ and ‘ more in the summer months			0
’ he was handed a formal warning and returned to work in march this year , though he is not allowed to examine female patients without a chaperone ‘ except in life - threatening situations ’			1
he was also prohibited from attending formal meetings with female trainee doctors unaccompanied in his role as training programme director with @entity60			0
but @entity1 could now be suspended or struck off completely after the panel 's ruling today			2
the consultant anaesthetist , a keen photographer , said he took his camera equipment to the woods to take ‘ spring photos ’ after finishing his on - call shift at 8am on 9 may last year			1
he then went into @entity13 carrying a satchel - type bag over his shoulder , which he had modified to hold a camera with its lens poking out of the front of the bag			1
the lens was concealed by a filter and he could switch the camera ’s video function on and off on a digital viewfinder in the side pouch of the bag			2
@entity1 told the panel he had made the bag around three or four years ago , but admitted he had used a similar one before			1
he was arrested after a security guard spotted him acting suspiciously near a young lady who was wearing a short skirt			0
magistrates acquitted the consultant of outraging public decency in october 2013 when the @entity40 offered no evidence			1
' reward ' : the consultant anaesthetist had finished a ' stressful ' period of work at @entity93 but he admitted his actions were ‘ sexually motivated ’ at this week 's fitness to practise hearing			1
he said he is undergoing treatment for the ‘ underlying issues ’ that cause his behaviour and insists he has not indulged in the unusual hobby since his arrest			0
earlier this week he claimed the incident followed three ' stressful events ' in his professional life , including a a formal complaint made against him by a patient who said he was ' rude and aggressive '			0
he said he had to give evidence at the @entity108 after a medical student he was in charge of continued onto third year even though he had n't been signed off			2
in a third incident , he said he had to help transfer a three - week - old baby to @entity114 hospital but the baby died			2
he said : ' i felt like my whole world had collapsed and this was the end and that 's it			0
ruling : @entity1 , who still works at @entity60 , is expected to have his professional fate decided tomorrow ' i found the experience one of the most stressful things i 've ever done			0
those legal practises - most of us are not used to this sort of environment			0
it does n't justify what i did , but in my mind the stresses inhibited me from dealing with the behaviour that was causing this			0
' @entity134 , chairman of the @entity136 panel , told him today : ‘ the panel has found your fitness to practise is impaired by reason of your misconduct			1
' however , she added : ' the determination has got many aspects that will relate to the doctor ’s health , so that determination will not be made available to the public			0
’ matters relating to the doctor ’s health condition , which was not elaborated upon , have been heard behind closed doors			0
a redacted version of the panel ’s findings is expected after his fate is decided tomorrow .			0
