they hired some of the most famous women in the country and a celebrity photographer to showcase their latest collection – forking out £ 5million for the privilege			2
but @entity8 ’s make - or - break advertising campaign has failed to deliver a much - needed boost to sales			1
@entity8 yesterday revealed that its sales of fashion and general merchandise have fallen , a trend that has hampered the firm for more than two years			2

unlike @entity8 , it relied on a reputation for low prices rather than expensive marketing campaigns to drive sales			2
@entity8 figures come despite its ‘ leading ladies ’ initiative , starring the likes of @entity50 and @entity51 and photographed by @entity52 , which was meant to propel the firm in a new direction			0
the chain faces a make - or - break @entity30 to turn round its fortunes as as its first - half pre-tax profits for 2013 declined by nine per cent to £ 261.1million , well down on the £ 289.5million the previous year			1

@entity72 attempted to revive clothes sales , particularly womenswear , earlier this year when he unveiled a new autumn / winter collection that analysts described as ' make or break ' for @entity8 and its chief executive			1
he said of the latest results : ' ‘ this is a journey			0
we ’ve been clear that people should look at it from season to season			0
it will take a few collections to get a positive momentum behind it			0
’ the latest sales figures cover the period up to the end of september , so @entity72 will defend performance and say that a fuller picture of its autumn / winter collection ’s success will be due in january			0
this week @entity8 launches its @entity30 ‘ believe in @entity32 and @entity34 ’ advertisement with a glossy @entity36 theme			1
it stars @entity37 as @entity36 , @entity100 as the @entity101 and @entity102 as the @entity103 it makes this year ’s @entity30 trading period even more crucial , and if it did not go well his job may be under threat			1
in contrast to the struggles of @entity8 as it tries to kickstart its clothing sales , @entity108 paid tribute to @entity16 's buying teams after autumn / winter and spring / summer ranges sold out with little discount			1
@entity16 's expansion in the @entity117 has been focused on increasing selling space in major cities , with the opening of its second store on @entity123 's @entity122 and extensions to shops in @entity126 and @entity127			2
the company expects to add more than a million square feet of space in the current year , including its first store in @entity131 , which will open in @entity132			0

' we are also enhancing customer service by providing a higher ratio of fitting rooms and cash registers to ensure a smoother experience when trying on outfits and paying for them			0
' in april , a building in @entity169 occupied on one of its floors by a @entity16 supplier collapsed , killing more than 1,100 people			2
another disastrous festive trading period will further test shareholders ’ patience who have become disillusioned with the retail giant ’s performance since @entity72 took over in may 2010			0
@entity180 , analyst at @entity181 , believes although the company is adopting the right strategy to revitalise its womenswear , he continues to have a number of concerns			0
