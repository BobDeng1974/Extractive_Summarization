after meeting @entity2 @entity1 for the first time in 2008 , prince @entity0 declared that the former @entity4 was ' a hero '			1
today , he turned out to roar on @entity6 , 27 , as he completed a gruelling 31 - mile run on behalf of the @entity8 - and told the runner to go and have a ' well - deserved beer '			1
the appearance of the royal came as a complete surprise to @entity14 , who had designed the route through @entity16 using a smartphone app to look like a @entity19 poppy			2
i did n’t expect to see @entity0 , ' said @entity14 , following the run			2
' he said " well done " and that i ’d raised lots of awareness for a good cause			0
' he told me to go have a bath and a well - deserved beer			2
it was just like picking up where we left off			0
' the two men first met in 2008 when a badly injured @entity14 was repatriated to the @entity40 on the same plane that was taking prince @entity0 home			2
clearly touched by his plight , the royal dubbed him a ' hero ' after learning that he had lost his left arm and right leg as a result of an ied blast			1
doctors had feared that @entity14 , from @entity51 , might die from his injuries but the former commando recovered and is now back on his feet with the help of a prosthetic leg			0
thrilled : @entity0 told the former soldier to go and have a ' well - deserved beer ' following his charity run hero : the former @entity4 was declared a hero by @entity0 after their first meeting in 2008 achievement : @entity6 during his run and in front of @entity67 ( left ) and with @entity68 despite the enormous amount of progress he has made , the former soldier did admit that it has n't always been easy and revealed that running on his prosthesis is painful			1
' i found it very difficult to get from a to @entity76 , ' he added			0
' the run was both physically and emotionally exhausting , but so rewarding			0
' joining prince @entity0 at the finish line close to the @entity24 was another former soldier , @entity78 veteran @entity68			1
who was badly burned when @entity83 bombers attacked a group of @entity40 troop transport ships in june 1982			0
along with @entity14 , mr @entity68 is a long standing supporter of the @entity8 , which is currently enjoying a boost courtesy of the @entity87 , which provided the technology required to create private @entity6 's poppy - shaped route			1
he had used a running app to create the giant poppy outline on a @entity16 map , which other runners can follow by visiting the website firsts.com			1
the @entity87 will match every pound donated to @entity14 ’s cause , up to £ 100,000 , and the funds raised will help the @entity19 ’s work to support ex-servicemen and women			0
big hug : @entity14 also got a huge hug from his running partner @entity105 as they completed the run hard work : @entity6 , seen here with mr @entity105 , described the run as tough but rewarding innovative : @entity6 used a @entity87 app to create his 31 - mile poppy shaped route ' we ’re hugely grateful to @entity1 and @entity87 for their commitment to the @entity119 and hope that @entity1 ’s run will inspire many others to take part in this exciting challenge , ' added @entity124 , the @entity19 's director of fundraising			1
' the money raised will provide vital support to serving and ex-service people , and their families , whether living with bereavement or disability , finding employment , or coping with financial stress - the same problems facing @entity135 veterans when they returned to the @entity40 100 years ago			0
