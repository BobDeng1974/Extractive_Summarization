@entity0 may have thrilled players at an @entity3 function by skolling a beer but he ’s drawn the ire of anti-drinking campaigners who claim he ’s glorifying binge drinking and associating being a man with drinking booze			1
@entity10 , a cultural studies professor at the @entity11 , said it was ' problematic ' that the prime minister , who she believes should be advocating against binge drinking , thought it acceptable to ' showcase his masculinity ' by skolling a beer			1
‘ it sets up a culture that drinking is n’t about socialising with friends , it ’s about how quickly and how much you can drink , ’ she said			1
’ on saturday night mr @entity0 appeared happy to oblige when he was asked to have a drink by @entity38 coach @entity37			0
it took the prime minister about six seconds to down the schooner as players cheered and chanted ' skol ' and ' @entity44 '			1
dr @entity45 warned people can forget their limits when they are wrapped up in the act of demonstrating how much , or how quickly , they can drink			0
' it is the whole performance and the display and showing off which is the problematic part , ' she told @entity55			0
however , she said it was not just mr @entity0 's skol that was concerning , it was also the way media and other government officials have reacted to the event			2
in an interview on sunday , opposition leader @entity62 quipped that he was ' just pleased that @entity0 ’s learning to drink beer without adding lemonade to it '			2
mr @entity0 was labelled ' un-australian ' for ordering a light beer during his 2010 campaign			0
dr @entity45 said while drinking was a part of the @entity24 tradition , it was dangerous to make comments that would only glorify irresponsible drinking practices and perpetuate the stereotype that drinking heavily makes you a true blue @entity24 bloke			0
critics said he should be setting an example that you do n't have to drink heavily to be a ' true blue @entity24 bloke ' it appeared to take the prime minister about six seconds to down the schooner , as players cheered and chanted ' skol ' and ' @entity44 ' health minister @entity88 was quick to jump to mr @entity0 's defence saying there was ' nothing wrong ' with the prime minister 's antics			1
“ if more people got up at 4.30 in the morning and went running and cycling and worked as hard as our prime minister to keep fit and demonstrate that there are many ways that you can do this , i think we ’d have a healthier country as a result , ’ ’ ms @entity88 said			2
during his night out , mr @entity0 gave a speech to the players , according to @entity107			0
' he grabs the microphone and gives a speech , which went along the lines of : ' well is n't this a real treat , i 've been a rugby man all my life but now i finally get to hang out with some real footballers ' to which of course the crowd went crazy , ' coach @entity37 said			0
' then he proceeds to reach down and grab a schooner and he drank from head - to - toe the entire schooner , dribbling little bits on his shirt ... he was proud as punch			0
' while mr @entity0 is not the first @entity24 prime minister to show off his skolling skills , with former @entity129 prime minister @entity128 a notable example , dr @entity125 said he should have taken into consideration recent shifts in attitudes over heavy drinking			1
' i do n’t necessarily think it ’s a partisan thing but i do think the climate has changed and we did n’t [ used to ] have the concern over binge drinking that we do now , ' she said			2
mr @entity0 was asked to have a drink by @entity38 coach @entity37 , and the prime minister happily obliged ' he drank the entire schooner , dribbling bits on his shirt ... he was proud as punch , ' a witness said			1
