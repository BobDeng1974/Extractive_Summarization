the victim , who had been sold to men across northern @entity18 and the @entity19 since the age of 13 , was even rebuked by one lawyer for fiddling and told to concentrate			2

shocking : full details of the harrowing treatment of child sex victims as witnesses during the trial of a street grooming gang have emerged			1
two members of the gang , @entity37 , left , and @entity38 , right , are pictured in court : critics claimed the trial shamed @entity43 justice			1
gang members @entity45 , left , and @entity45 , right , are pictured another vulnerable victim - who was visibly upset - was asked by a defence lawyer to read out line by line from a police statement she gave detailing alleged sexual abuse by her stepfather			1
the treatment of witnesses in the trial - which took place at @entity57 in 2011 and can now only be reported - has resulted in charities and politicians calling for the better treatment of vulnerable witnesses in child sex cases			2
critics have said the trial shamed @entity43 justice			1
according to @entity65 , judge @entity22 said at the time : ' i feel as though i 've been hit over the head with a large hammer and there seems no end to it			2
' @entity73 : critics claimed the trial at @entity57 shamed @entity43 justice after the young victims who suffered from years of sexual abuse were subjected to aggressive cross-examination in the dock : @entity80 , left , and @entity81 , right , were part of the gang speaking to @entity65 , @entity84 , @entity85 , the @entity86 , said that he would be holding talks which could lead to young victims taking part in pre-recorded cross-examination sessions rather than being cross-examined in court			1
@entity93 , of the @entity94 , told the newspaper : ' we have surely reached the point where this kind of appalling treatment of child abuse victims can not continue			1

the accused men were @entity37 , @entity108 , @entity81 , @entity80 , @entity38 , @entity45 , @entity45			0
some of the lawyers acting for the men were accused of aggressively questioning the witnesses in court			0
way forward : @entity84 , @entity85 , the @entity86 , has hinted that future young victims could take part in pre-recorded cross-examination sessions rather than appear in court during her 12 days of cross-examination , the 18 - year - old victim , who had been sold to men across northern @entity18 and the @entity19 since the age of 13 , spent 12 days being cross examined by a number of defence lawyers acting for the accused men			1
she was even rebuked by one lawyer for fiddling and told to concentrate			0
after reliving her horrors , she finally broke down in tears in front of the appalled jury			0
but even this did not prevent even tougher questioning for another victim			2
the girl , who had told the court of being taken by men to have sex with their friends , was asked to read out line by line from a previous statement which she had made to police about being sexually abused by her stepfather			1
the allegations were made by the girl when she was 13 but were withdrawn by the girl			0
she said she had made up the allegations but later said she had been abused but dropped the case because she was concerned about the impact on her mother			0
however , this did not prevent defence barrister @entity152 from using the statement to say that her evidence to the court could not be trusted			0
as the girl painfully read out line by line of what her stepfather did to her , jurors looked on in anger and another defence barrister walked out of the court apparently in disgust			1
the seven defendants were convicted of child sex offences against four girls			0
the trial at @entity170 collapsed in september 2011 and the men were later convicted in a series of smaller retrials			0
