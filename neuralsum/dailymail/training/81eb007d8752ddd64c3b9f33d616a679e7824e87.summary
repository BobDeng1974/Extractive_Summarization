by @entity0 for most people , taking a ' selfie ' is a simple case of aim , pose and snap			0

oblivious : @entity15 ( left ) , 16 , and her friend , @entity16 , smile at a camera phone while lying on a bed at a house in @entity21 , @entity22			1
but unbeknown to @entity15 , they are not alone - as a spider is sat on the sheets what 's that ? however , as the girls gaze at the screen , their smiles fade as they spot the eight - legged creature is it really there ? this photo shows @entity15 glancing over her shoulder to confirm the spider is actually there @entity39 ! the teenager then opens her mouth and screams , while @entity16 continues to gaze at the camera phone the first photo shows @entity15 , 16 , and her friend , @entity16 , smiling at a camera phone while lying on a bed at a house in @entity21 , @entity22			1
but unbeknown to @entity15 , they are not alone - as a spider is positioned between their heads on the sheets			2
however , as the teenagers gaze at the screen , their smiles suddenly fade as they spot the eight - legged creature			2
a subsequent photo shows @entity15 glancing over her shoulder to confirm the spider is actually there , before opening her mouth wide and screaming			0
aaargh ! @entity15 is captured screaming at the eight - legged intruder , which is situated in between the girls ' heads it 's actually a spider ! @entity16 appears to comprehend the fact that a spider is sat just inches away from her head now we 've both seen it ! she then turns to glance at the creature and also starts screaming , with her eyes wide @entity16 then turns to glance at the creature and also starts screaming , while her friend covers her mouth and bursts into a fit of giggles			1
but despite their apparent fear , the teenagers continue to lie on the bed - and even manage to keep snapping selfies			0
and just seconds later , @entity16 reveals to @entity15 that the spider is actually a fake arachnid that she has planted on the bed in a bid to scare her friend			1
after getting over her initial fright , @entity15 uploaded the photos to @entity90 and @entity91 and they quickly went viral - with hundreds of internet users deeming them ' hilarious '			1

' i had no idea what to do so i basically just froze , ' she said			0
' the photos were taken over the course of about five seconds and i was waiting for @entity16 's reaction to see if the spider was real			0
' but @entity16 had , in fact , set me up and played along with it			0
the toy spider was lying around her house so she thought she 'd prank me with it			0
' she told me after the last picture and we looked back at the pictures and laughed so much , so i decided to put them on @entity91			0
gotcha ! @entity16 later revealed to @entity15 that the spider was actually a fake arachnid that she had planted on the bed in a bid to scare her friend			1
the girls then uploaded the photos online and they quickly went viral ' the fact that they went viral in a matter of a week was extraordinary and i could n't believe it was happening			2
