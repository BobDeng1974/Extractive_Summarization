rock - solid @entity0 have picked up where they left off last season and have now kept eight clean sheets in their past nine home league games			1
in a sterile first half , the loudest cheer was for the homecoming hero warming up			0
@entity8 had only to emerge from the technical area to galvanise @entity10			1
frankly , in a poor opening 45 minutes , there was precious little else about which to get excited			0
when @entity8 finally received the call to make his first appearance at @entity10 since leaving in 2012 — by which time @entity0 were 2 - 0 up — the excitement was near feverish			1
even @entity0 owner @entity18 wore a broad smile and applauded enthusiastically			2
shooting boots : @entity21 nets his first goal in as many games in a @entity0 shirt to put his side ahead coming good : @entity26 had to have some sharp words with his striker in the first half , but it paid off however , the question remains whether the return of @entity8 at 36 years of age amounts to a glorified testimonial year or a viable alternative for manager @entity26			1
it is probably a bit of both			0
that said , given the paucity of world - class strikers , and the reality that a really good player will not come to sit on the bench , then there is some sense behind the decision			2
@entity8 ’s physicality and know - how are bound to carry @entity0 through a few tricky moments and in the first half against @entity52 he may well have led the line better than @entity21			1
@entity26 has warm words for the @entity55 - born @entity21 , who speaks no @entity56 but seems to communicate with everyone just by charisma			0
he has also scored two goals in as many games , when it took @entity62 24 to reach that total			2
@entity21 also felt the sharp end of @entity26 ’s tongue during the first half , presumably for not offering enough movement			0
@entity8 might have handled a side like @entity52 better , but the trouble is it would be a risk to start with the @entity70 knowing that he probably only has an hour of good football in him			1
that means @entity0 are likely to resist any offer for @entity62 , at least until they have a replacement			1
@entity76 : @entity21 's goal eased the tension around @entity10 after a poor first half return of the king : @entity8 was given a hero 's welcome when he came on with the game won @entity26 is genuine when he says he needs his @entity85 striker — though his failure to even win a place on the bench indicates just where he ranks			1
@entity0 look to have finally solved their striker problem , with @entity21 netting twice already this season and 36 - year - old @entity8 providing solid back - up			1
@entity62 , though , who did n’t make the squad against @entity52 , will not be allowed to leave the club , despite being linked with a move to @entity96			1
‘ i want three strikers in the team , ’ manager @entity26 said			0
‘ i can not do a season without three strikers			0
he ( @entity62 ) will play and score goals			2
he is a fantastic guy , a fantastic professional , so there is no problem			0
’ @entity8 ’s role will surely be principally as a substitute but any injury to @entity21 would surely mean @entity62 would start , especially when the two - games - a - week schedule kicks in			1
‘ this ( situation ) is over next week , ’ @entity26 said			0
‘ after that we have @entity111 and @entity112			0
everything is much easier then because all will be playing			0
’ the striking options @entity0 have at their disposal this season do seem a considerable step up from what they had last term			2
ultimately though , it stills looks short of the talent champions @entity121 can draw upon — assuming they all stay fit , of course			0
long term , even the euphoria surrounding @entity8 ’s return will not help @entity0 bridge that gap			1
bench warmer : torres did n't even make the squad against @entity52 and is @entity26 's third choice striker			2
