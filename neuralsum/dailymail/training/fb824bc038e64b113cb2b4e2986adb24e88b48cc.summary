‘ it means not just @entity24 , it ’s also about standing at the schoolgate and talking to mums as well			1
‘ i just would n’t underestimate face - to - face contact			1
we are just trying to go and stand at the schoolgate and you see a lot of people going by , a lot of people in a hurry but there are also people who just want to talk about something that they are worried about			0
‘ politicians should always go to where people are , rather than expecting people to come to where politics is			0
