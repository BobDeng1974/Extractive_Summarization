by @entity0 published : 09:24 est , 7 may 2012 updated : 09:24 est , 7 may 2012 billions when life was just beginning to emerge on @entity3 , nearby @entity1 could also have been a watery world shrouded in a dense atmosphere that could have supported life			1
one of the reasons water no longer flows on @entity1 's surface is because its atmosphere is less than 1 % of the density of the @entity3 's			1
but professor @entity10 , of @entity12 university , looked at a crater left by a rock fragment around 3.5 billion years ago , found by @entity15 - and realised from the depth of the crater that the atmosphere must once have been much thicker			2
but professor @entity10 , of @entity12 university , looked at a crater left by a rock fragment around 3.5 billion years ago , found by @entity15 - and realised from the depth of the crater that the atmosphere must once have been much thicker @entity23 on @entity1 - which some scientists believe may have been carved by glaciers			1
a growing body of evidence points to the fact that water once flowed on the planet a @entity12 university researcher looked at a crater left by a rock fragment around 3.5 billion years ago - and realised from its depth that the atmosphere must once have been much thicke it adds to a growing body of evidence that water once flowed on @entity1			1
he began his studies with a rock fragment propelled into the @entity1 atmosphere during a volcanic eruption roughly 3.5 billion years ago , reports journal @entity45			2
the @entity15 landed at the site in 2007 and took a close look at the remaining fragment , enabling prof @entity10 and colleagues to calculate the size , depth and shape of the divot			0
the team then created craters of their own for comparison , firing particles into grains the same size as those found by @entity15			0
they calculated that the speed the particles must have been moving to recreate the divot would have required an atmospheric pressure 20 times greater than that found today			0
this suggests @entity1 once had a thicker atmosphere , said prof @entity10			1
he said : ‘ atmospheric pressure has likely played a role in developing almost all @entity1 ' surface features			2
‘ the planet 's climate , the physical state of water on its surface and the potential for life are all influenced by atmospheric conditions			2
‘ our study is consistent with growing research that early @entity1 was at least a transiently watery world with a much denser atmosphere than we see today			1
the mosaic image captured by the @entity89 orbiter is colour - coded for elevation , showing the valleys and cliffs thought to have been carved out by ancient floods on the surface the @entity96 region on the surface is dotted with buttes , valleys and craters thought to have been carved out by energetic masses of liquid in the distant past ‘ we were only able to study one bomb sag at one location on the @entity1			0
we hope to do future tests on other samples based on observations by the next rover , @entity109			0
’ an earlier study found gypsum on @entity1 - indicating there was once water on @entity1 and the possibility of life			0
@entity116 reports that the gypsum could only have been formed in water below 60 c and writes : ‘ that means that conditions conducive to life once existed on the edge of the crater			0

crater on surface ' proves ' @entity1 must have once had thicker atmosphere
one of reasons water does *n't* flow on @entity1 is atmosphere is 1 % as thick as @entity3 's
adds to growing body of evidence @entity1 was once a watery world like @entity3
