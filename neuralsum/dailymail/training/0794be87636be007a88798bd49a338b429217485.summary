high - energy particles called cosmic rays that smash into @entity3 's atmosphere could be detected by a global network of smartphones			1
that 's according to researchers who have developed an app that can detect incoming particles from elsewhere in the universe			1
this could help scientists detect and track rare cosmic ray events , and it may help to work out exactly where they are going from			2
a giant detector could be made by combining smartphones around the world			1
these could then alert scientists when cosmic rays ( illustrated ) hit our planet			1
sensors in the camera of smartphones can detect incoming particles the app was devised by scientists at the @entity35			1
called @entity36 ( @entity37 found in @entity38 ) , the app collects data in the background when the phone is not being used			0
it will be available to uses on both @entity44 and @entity45 , although it is currently only in limited beta mode			0
to detect cosmic rays the app makes use of the silicon - based sensors in smartphone cameras			1
a long - standing puzzle in astrophysics is the source of ultra-high - energy particles from space that hit @entity3			1
called cosmic rays , they 're up to a billion times more energetic than particles at @entity61 's @entity60			2
they strike the atmosphere and cause an enormous shower of other particles , mostly muons , electrons and photons , over a wide area			0
though they were discovered decades ago , cosmic rays at these high energies are very rare , making it difficult to pinpoint where in the universe they originated			2
it 's thought that some come from supernovas , but it 's likely there are other sources of cosmic rays in the universe as well			2
the digital sensors in a smartphone are sensitive to particles in a cosmic ray shower , and they can also provide location information thanks to @entity89			0
' most importantly , there are 1.5 billion active smartphones spread across the planet , ' the researchers write on their website			0
' essentially , this detector has already been deployed ; all that is missing is the app to collect the data			0
' as a side benefit , the same data can be used to calculate local levels of radiation from radon or other sources and function as an alarm system			0
the network of phones could provide a real - time radiation weather map , following the movement of plumes , for instance			0
with regards to cosmic rays this is the first attempt to demonstrate that a global network of devices can rival or exceed the scientific capabilities of huge , dedicated cosmic ray experiment sites such as the @entity120 in @entity121			2
' @entity123 square kilometers can be drenched in these particles for a few milliseconds , ' said @entity35 physicist dr @entity126 , who created the app with colleague dr @entity128			0
' the mystery is nobody knows where these crazy , high - energy particles are coming from or what 's making them so energetic			1
but they can be captured by technology in smartphones ' cameras			0
' people can now sign up for email alerts on the official website to find out when the app will be available to use			0
the app use a phone 's camera sensors to detect high - energy cosmic rays			1
anyone will be able to download the app and join the network ( stock image shown )			0
it 's hoped the project may reveal the origins of cosmic rays			1
these high - energy particles originate elsewhere in the universe and hit @entity3			1

@entity18 scientists create app to track cosmic rays
giant detector could be made by combining smartphones around the world
these could then alert scientists when cosmic rays hit our planet
sensors in the camera of smartphones can detect incoming particles
the app uses these sensors to detect high - energy cosmic rays
anyone will be able to download the app and join the network
it 's hoped the project may reveal the origins of cosmic rays
these high - energy particles originate elsewhere in the universe and hit @entity3
some come from supernovas , but they have other *unknown* sources as well
