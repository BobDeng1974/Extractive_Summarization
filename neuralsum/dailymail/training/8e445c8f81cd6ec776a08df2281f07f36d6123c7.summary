@entity0 has arrived in @entity1 as he prepares for his world title shot against the fearsome @entity3 on saturday			1
and the @entity5 middleweight writes exclusively for @entity6 as he counts down the days to his third challenge for top honours			2
i had a great camp in @entity11 ; it was a great trip and we were really well looked after			1
as time went on , things got better and better and we left in a good place			1
it was definitely the right thing to do even though it 's been hard being away from the family			2
the first couple of weeks were difficult with the altitude but towards the end everything was flowing and i was feeling good as my body adapted to it			1
@entity0 relaxes in @entity1 ahead of his fight with @entity3 on saturday @entity0 recovers in his hotel room as he prepares to challenge for a world title for the third time read the first installment here			1
every fighter says they 've had a great camp but i 'm not one to lie			1
it 's been a good camp , no two ways about it			1
there have been a couple of things that have n't gone well , as there is with every camp , but we 've managed to get over them and make it work			2
i 've never worked at altitude as i did so if the science behind it is right , i 'll be the fittest i 've ever been			2
i 'm also more experienced than i 've ever been , it 's my third world title fight , and i 'm confident			1
i know how hard it 's going to be but i 'm really looking forward to it			0
we went on safari on the last weekend but that was the only tourist thing we did			0
everything else was just training , training , training			2
i 'm not good to be around on fight week			0
i 'm in a hotel room on my own , the rest of the lads are in a different hotel and i do n't see them much , i keep myself to myself			0
i 'm getting a bit agitated , the fight 's getting closer and i just want to fight			0
that will change when i weigh in and get some food ; i 'll be happy again			0
@entity0 ( third left ) with gym - mate @entity65 and the team from @entity68 's @entity67 in @entity69 @entity65 poses with a lion cub on the team 's safari trip on their final weekend before flying to @entity1 @entity3 is in the hotel next to mine but there 's no chance i 'll see him because i do n't go out			1
i wo n't see him apart from at the press conference and the weigh - in			0
i just see the fight as a big job and if i want me and my family to have the lifestyle i want us to have , i have to beat him			0
@entity83 said the way to beat @entity3 is to take the fight to him but it 's easy to say that			1
it depends what kind of fighter you are			0
@entity83 might be saying that because it 's maybe something he wishes he 'd done			0
i 'm going to work on the tactics we 've come up with			0
people change when they get hit so i 've not just got one game plan , i 've got 10 , 11 , 12 ... i just want to fight , it does n't bother me who it is			0
i was in the lift with my manager and i said i wished he was @entity3 ! it might be daunting for some people , but i ca n't wait .			1
