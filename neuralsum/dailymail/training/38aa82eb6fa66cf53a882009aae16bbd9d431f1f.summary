by @entity0 it 's easy to forget that bugs have faces - complete with eyes , a mouth and , if not a nose , a pair of large antennae			2
but now a wildlife photographer has captured extreme close - ups of creepy crawlies - revealing the complex compound eyes of flies , the triangular profile of a praying mantis and a moth during metamorphosis among others			1
many of the images have been lit in such a way they resemble mind tricks , optical illusions and even ink blots			2
this macro image of a pair of owlflies was taken by 33 - year - old photographer @entity28 at his home studio in @entity30 , @entity31			1
owlflies are dragonfly - like insects with large eyes			2
they are distant relatives of flies , dragonflies and damselflies and typically grow up to 2 - inches ( 5cm ) long the images were shot by 33 - year - old @entity28 at his home studio in @entity30 , @entity31			1
he used a photography technique known as focus stacking , also known as focus blending , which combines multiple shots of the same subject , taken at different focal distances			1
@entity28 was able to capture the extreme close - ups by placing his camera 4 - inches away , but other shots were captured at up to 20 - inches distance			1
each image took around ten minutes and involved @entity28 keeping calm and still so not to disturb the insects			1
@entity28 said : ' all of the photographs were taken in my studio in @entity31			1
all of the insects had to be incredibly still for the process to work			2
among his collection were a pair of owlflies , which @entity28 captured facing each other to resemble an ink blot			1
owlflies are dragonfly - like insects with large eyes			2
they are distant relatives of flies , dragonflies and damselflies and typically grow up to 2 - inches ( 5cm ) long			1
the images were shot using a photography technique known as focus stacking , also known as focus blending , which combines multiple shots of the same subject , taken at different focal distances			1
@entity28 was able to capture extreme close - ups , including this shot of a soldierfly , by placing his camera 4 - inches ( 10cm ) away in addition to insects , @entity28 also shot alien - looking images of praying mantises			1
the head consists of a rounded triangle with eyes that take up almost three quarters of the creature 's face			2
it is the only insect that can swivel its head over its shoulder , over 300 ° , which gives the mantis a distinct advantage when looking for prey wasps , such as the one captured in this image , do not reproduce during mating flights , like bees			1
instead they reproduce between a fertile queen and either a single , or multiple male wasps			2
after successfully mating , the male 's sperm cells are stored in a tightly packed ball inside the queen until they are needed wasps , such as the ones captured in @entity28 's collection , do not reproduce during mating flights , like bees			1
instead they reproduce between a fertile queen and either a single , or multiple male wasps			0
after successfully mating , the male 's sperm cells are stored in a tightly packed ball inside the queen until they are needed			0
meanwhile , the adult solider fly , photographed by @entity28 , grows up to 0.6 inches ( 1.6cm ) and only lives up to eight days			1
its colour and size mimics the appearance of the organ pipe mud dauber wasp , this is enhanced by the fly 's elongated , wasp - like antennae			0
in addition to insects , @entity28 also shot alien - looking images of praying mantises			1

this image , which resembles a human face , is a macro photo of a longhorn beetle			2
several species are pests and the larvae often bores into wood , where they can cause damage to trees and structures			0
a number of species mimic ants , bees , and wasps by taking images over a series of weeks , @entity28 was able to capture a moth going through metamorphosis ( pictured left ) , and emerging ( pictured right )			1
for the most part , moths are nocturnal and they fly and feed at night			0
butterflies and moths pupate , or become adults , differently			0
both go through their metamorphosis in a chrysalis , but moths will often spin a silk cocoon around this protective shell , sometimes camouflaging it with leaves or debris although the majority of @entity28 's images focus on flies , this shot is of a metallic jumping spider			1
these spiders have been known to jump from 10 to 50 times their own body length by increasing the blood pressure in their legs			0
their large eyes have stereoscopic vision to help them stalk prey and communicate with the opposite sex in one image , which resembles a human face , @entity28 also captured the front of a longhorn beetle			1

to capture this image of a fly , @entity28 's photos were taken by gradually changing the distance of the subject			1
this involved moving the camera , rather than than subject , which in this case was the insect			2
individual photos are then aligned so their content is overlaid pixel - by - pixel to create the effect seen here adult owlflies , such as the one pictured , have been known to release a strong chemical to deter enemies			0
they typically hunt at sunset and dawn , while resting during the day on twigs			0
its eggs are laid under stones and as larvae develops it becomes predatory although the majority of @entity28 's images focus on flying insects , he also photographs metallic jumping spiders			1

its colour and size mimics the appearance of the organ pipe mud dauber wasp , enhanced by the fly 's elongated , wasp - like antennae this macro photo shows an extreme close - up of a black and yellow wasp			1
the shot reveals the wasp 's compound eyes , its mandible and the bottom of its antennae			0
the mandible is typically used to grasp and crush food , or to defend itself			0

the images were taken by photographer @entity28 , 33 , at his home studio in @entity30 , @entity31
he used a technique known as focus stacking that combines multiple images taken at different focal distances
@entity28 captures extreme close - ups by placing the camera 4 - inches away , but other shots were captured at 20 inches
the series features shots of metallic jumping spiders , moths , and the *bizarre* triangular face of the praying mantis
each image took around ten minutes and involved @entity28 keeping calm and still so not to disturb the insects
