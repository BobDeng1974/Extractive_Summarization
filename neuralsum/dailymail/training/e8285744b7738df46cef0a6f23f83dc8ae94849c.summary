by @entity0 a quick - thinking @entity2 woman has been diagnosed with a stroke after she filmed herself suffering the symptoms - after doctors previously insisted she was simply stressed			1
@entity6 , 49 , from @entity7 , @entity8 , recognized her numbness and partial facial paralysis as signs of having a stroke , so she went to the @entity13 - but doctors sent her away with advice on how to manage stress			1
' they told me i needed to learn how to manage my stress , ' she told @entity19			2
' i just laughed to myself and thought , " this is not stress "			2
i couldnt believe that was the diagnosis they came up with			0
doctors had told her she was simply stressed but she thought it was a stroke struggle : the 49 - year - old also showed how it was tough for her to use her left hand during the episode but two days later , the numbness returned as she was driving - so she pulled over and grabbed her smartphone			1
' the sensation is happening again , ' she says in the video			0
' it 's all tingling on left side			0
' she then tries to lift her left arm but says she finds it hard to point at specific things , like her nose			0
she also films herself following the advice of the doctors to breathe in and out slowly to manage her stress , but the symptoms persist			1
relief : @entity6 showed doctors the footage and they concluded she had suffered several mini strokes			1
she is taking time off work and taking medication to prevent any future strokes the @entity59 gives five warning signs of stroke : weakness : sudden loss of strength , numbness in face , arm or leg , even if it 's only temporary trouble speaking : sudden difficulty talking or understanding spoken language , even if temporary vision problems : sudden trouble with vision , even if temporary headache : sudden severe or unusual headache dizziness : sudden loss of balance , especially with any of the above signs			1
doctors advise people to dial 911 at the first sign of a stroke			2
' i think it was just to show somebody , because i knew it was not stress - related , ' she told @entity88			2
' and i thought if i could show somebody what was happening , they would have a better understanding			0
' afterwards , she went to @entity94 in @entity95 - a different hospital from her first visit - and was referred to @entity99 's stroke center			2
doctors there concluded that @entity6 was having a transient ischemic attack or @entity103 , which is also called a mini-stroke			1
she told @entity19 each one had lasted between seven and 10 minutes			0
she had an mri scan and the stroke team identified a small injury			0
they determined that her mini strokes were caused by a buildup of plaque in her arteries , and a blood clot then formed on the plaque , blocking an artery leading to her brain			1
although she only suffered temporary mini strokes , they are a sign that a full - blown stroke could be around the corner			1
support : she went to @entity94 in @entity95 , pictured , and they sent her to see a specialist ' in all my years treating stroke patients , we â€™ve never seen anyone tape themselves before , ' dr @entity126 , the stroke neurologist at the hospital 's @entity127 , told @entity88			0
' her symptoms were compelling , and the fact she stopped and found a way to portray them in such a visual fashion , we were all touched by it			0
' @entity6 , a legal secretary in @entity95 , told @entity19 she was ' feeling good ' and is now being monitored and taking medication			1
she has been off work but hopes to return in july			0

@entity6 , 49 , could *n't* believe it when doctors said her numbness and facial paralysis was *due* to stress
so when it happened again , she took out her camera to record the proof
doctors at a different hospital *agreed* she had suffered a *series* of mini strokes and learned that she had a blood clot
she is now *undergoing* treatment and is being monitored by doctors
