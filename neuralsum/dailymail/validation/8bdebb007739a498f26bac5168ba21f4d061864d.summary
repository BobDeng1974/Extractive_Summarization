the 21 - year - old 's name was written next to @entity12 's with two large circles around each and in front of a back three of @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22			0

@entity2 skipper @entity12 takes a tumble after a tackle from @entity67 defender @entity21 ( right ) the 27 - year - old will be hoping his impressive form for @entity135 continues in an @entity2 shirt after assessing the results , the @entity2 medical staff decided @entity95 would not be able to play in the upcoming matches and sent the striker back to @entity105			2
@entity95 's withdrawal is unfortunate for the player and @entity5 , who has not been able to select the 25 - year - old since september			0
as one of just three strikers in the 24 - man party , @entity0 now has a good chance of starting either the @entity149 qualifier at @entity150 or the friendly in @entity152 four days later			2
