by @entity0 the @entity2 @entity1 has ruled that a copyright lawsuit over the 1980 @entity5 - winning film ' @entity6 ' can go ahead despite the movie being more than 30 years old			1
the film , starring @entity9 as @entity10 and directed by @entity11 , is the story of a boxer who has a self - destructive attitude and obsessive rage			0
@entity16 collaborated with mr @entity10 on a book and two screenplays , which is said to have inspired the movie			1
he died in 1981 , passing copyright on to his daughter , @entity20			0
however , the @entity1 has now reversed the ruling giving ms @entity34 the chance to resurrect her lawsuit			1
the decision is said to be a blow to movie studios , which have long relied on the legal doctrine of unreasonable delay to prevent distant relatives and estates from bringing copyright claims years or decades after movies have been released			1
federal copyright law allows people to bring copyright claims within three years of an infringing act			2
ms @entity34 's claim fell within that time because the studio continued to release the film on dvd and other formats for years and every new release essentially reset the clock for copyright purposes			1
@entity26 argue that she delayed filing her case on purpose in hopes of getting more money , saying she waited until after the 25th anniversary of the movie in 2005 to press her claim			2
but allowing the suit to go forward , justice @entity66 said : ' there is nothing untoward about waiting to see whether an infringer is making money , so that litigation is worth the candle ' it will put at risk only a fraction of the income @entity26 has earned during that period and will work no unjust hardship on innocent third parties , such as consumers who have purchased copies of @entity6			0
mr @entity16 's daughter @entity20 believes she is entitled to royalties from the film , pictured here , starring mr @entity9 , left and @entity85 , right in dissent , justice @entity86 said the legal doctrine of unreasonable delay should apply to ms @entity34 's case because she waited 18 years after renewing her copyright to file a lawsuit			1
the effect of delaying legal action can give plaintiffs an unfair advantage in a copyright claim as witnesses die and memories fade , @entity86 said , and should be a viable defence			0
groups including the @entity102 , @entity103 , @entity104 and @entity105 sided with @entity26 , arguing that it 's unfair to allow plaintiffs to wait years or decades to file copyright claims while studios invest millions in their products			2
ms @entity34 won support from groups including the @entity113 and the @entity114 in her case concerning the film @entity6 but ms @entity34 won support from groups including the @entity113 and the @entity114			2
they argued that the rolling three - year copyright protection is fair to artists and gives them incentive to create their works @entity123 , general counsel for the @entity113 said : ' this is definitely a victory for the little guy who do n't have teams of lawyers and boundless financial resources			0
while @entity129 , a copyright law expert at the @entity131 law firm in @entity132 added : ' what you have now is the ability for a plaintiff to come out of the woodwork and say that some creative work that was a hit in the 70s , 80s or 90s belonged to them			0
' i would say there 's now going to be an explosion of these types of cases			0

@entity1 rules @entity34 can sue @entity26 seeking royalties from film
her father @entity154 collaborated on two screenplays that inspired the movie
@entity1 had ruled in 2009 that her claim was filed too late
but that decision has been reversed and she can proceed with her lawsuit
fears more relatives could bring claims against movie studios
