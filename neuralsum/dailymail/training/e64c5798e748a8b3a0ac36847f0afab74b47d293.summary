for those debating between which seasonal ski pass to purchase , experience level and location are two major factors to consider			0
@entity7 's infographic is a detailed breakdown that helps winter tourists make an informed choice when it comes to deciding between popular season pass contenders : the @entity14 ' @entity13 and @entity17 's @entity16 pass			1
but , as it turns out , a traveller 's best option hinges on whether they 're a weekend or destination skier			2
for those who love to travel and enjoy winter sports with a bit of international flavour , the $ 749 ( £ 478 ) @entity13 may just be worth the investment - even if you ski just 10 days in three different @entity27 resorts			1
this pass is valid not only at @entity27 's @entity31 ski hills , but also at their @entity33 , @entity34 and @entity35 resorts			0
for those sticking close to home and heading to slopes only on weekends , @entity16 's $ 389 ( £ 248 ) option is likely a much better bet			1
but they will have to be satisfied with keeping to @entity31 soil though , since @entity16 does not offer any @entity45 or @entity46 ski destinations			2
for beginners , the @entity16 option may be best , while five per cent more of the hills on the @entity13 are targeted for the advanced contingent			1
@entity7 has also outlined the optimal ski road trip route - for each pass - to help skiers hit as many @entity31 resorts as possible			0
there is also a handy reference guide when it comes to picking family - friendly hills , local restaurants and the best apres - ski watering holes .			0

@entity14 ' @entity13 *versus* @entity17 's @entity16
for weekend skiers , the *cheaper* @entity16 option may be best
but if you 're looking to travel internationally , opt for the $ 749 @entity13
