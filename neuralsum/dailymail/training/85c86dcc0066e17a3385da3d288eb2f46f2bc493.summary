the @entity4 diet requires people to cut out ' grains , legumes , certain dairy products , conventionally - raised meats , non-organic produce , and genetically modified and processed foods ' , which ms @entity79 says is not practical for many @entity2			2
ms @entity17 said the diet was first suggested by researchers in 1985 to combat current - day chronic diseases that were a result of ' gene - culture mismatch ' and humans ' inability to adapt to diets beyond the palaeolithic period			0
