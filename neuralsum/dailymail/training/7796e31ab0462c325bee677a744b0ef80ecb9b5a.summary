a grieving mother has released this poignant picture of her daughter crying moments after being born at 24 weeks			1
@entity4 wants to show how developed her baby was at this stage of pregnancy – the legal limit for abortions in @entity10			1
@entity11 survived for only about an hour after she was delivered by doctors who tried in vain to keep her alive			2
she calls her son , who is due in january 2015 , her ' rainbow child ' because rainbows appear after the storm this is mrs @entity29 ’ only picture of her daughter , and was taken by one of the medics before the infant died			1
she and her husband @entity34 , a security guard , think the legal limit of 24 weeks for an abortion should be lowered			1
‘ our picture shows @entity11 was not a foetus , ’ said mrs @entity4 , 35 , from @entity16 , @entity17			1
‘ she was a fully formed human being , and to think that a baby like her could be legally terminated is to me horrifying			0
’ she added : ‘ our hospital was amazing but @entity11 suffered complications which made it impossible for her to survive			2
‘ but many babies born at 24 weeks do live			2
that makes a mockery of the 24 - week legal limit			1
‘ our daughter may not have lived long but she was still our daughter and we love to talk about her and celebrate her life			0
’ @entity4 and @entity53 fell in love in the agonising weeks after mrs @entity4 lost her first daughter @entity55 mrs @entity4 , who also lost her first baby , at 23 weeks , continued : ‘ i find it hurtful when people use the term late miscarriage to describe our daughter because she was born so early into my pregnancy			1
i think this picture of her crying out shows that clearly that is not the case			0
‘ i went through labour and delivery with both of my premature babies			0
‘ my first daughter was born at 23 weeks and classed as a late miscarriage			1
@entity11 was born at 24 weeks and classed as neo-natal death but they looked exactly the same			1
‘ @entity11 lived for more than an hour and will always be very much part of our lives			0
‘ i hope this beautiful picture of my daughter being born helps change people ’s perspectives			0
’ medical advances mean significant numbers of premature babies are surviving being born at just 23 weeks into a pregnancy			2
the couple 's daughter @entity11 was born at just 24 weeks old , but unfortunately doctors told @entity89 and mrs @entity4 they could n't get a line in to help her breathe on their wedding day mrs @entity4 said she woke up , put on a bracelet to remember her deceased daughter , and then pulled on her wedding dress to get married research shows many @entity10 specialist neo-natal units have vastly improved on survival rates			1
data from 25 hospitals over the past four years shows that 120 babies born at 23 weeks survived			1
around 560 babies are aborted at 23 weeks every year			2
mrs @entity4 , who works in customer services , married her 29 - year - old husband on the anniversary of the birth and death of her first child , @entity55			1
@entity11 was conceived through ivf and her parents were relieved to reach the 24 - week stage , when medics are legally obliged to help save the life of a premature baby			2
mrs @entity4 said : ‘ only then did i buy her a baby - grow and @entity116 bought her a pink cuddly bunny			1
’ mr and mrs @entity4 married on september 8th 2012 in a villa in @entity120			2

one - year - olds @entity135 and @entity137 were barely the size of a hand when they were born on september 21 last year , weighing 1lb 6oz and 1lb 7oz			0
their skin was so weak their parents @entity145 , 30 , and her partner @entity146 , 42 , could n’t even touch them for nine days , and both needed heart surgery			0
miss @entity145 , of @entity150 , said she felt her sons were ‘ treated like foetuses ’ , but despite dire predictions they were eventually allowed to be taken home on their exact due date			0
but only three days later mrs @entity4 started to bleed and was taken to the specialist premature baby unit at @entity157 in @entity158			1
in december 2013 she had an emergency caesarean section			0
her husband stayed by her side as their tiny daughter let out a cry as she was delivered by doctors			0
it was at that moment a doctor took the only picture of @entity11 alive on the couple ’s camera			0
mrs @entity4 said : ‘ that cry filled us with so much hope			2
her little fists were waving and i could see the doctors working on her			0
’ but an hour later doctors told the couple that it was proving impossible to get a line into their daughter ’s lungs to help her breathe			0
they agreed that the kindest thing they could do would be to let her go			0
