by @entity0 the @entity1 released in 1914 had one simple objective - ' get the @entity3 and the @entity4			1
' documents from the @entity6 which have been discovered in the @entity7 give a startling insight into the explicit racism in @entity11 society well into the 1900s			1
the rules of the game state ' place the men the same as the ' game '			0
the puzzle required the player to get all the ' coloured ' men out of @entity11 and replace them with ' white men '			2
the @entity23 ' the game was advertised as ' a new @entity11 game for @entity26 and @entity27 ' , sold for a sixpence , and included two bonus puzzles			2
@entity30 , @entity31 at the @entity32 told the @entity33 the game was ' very much to do with the @entity34 '			2
' the aim of this game is to get them to change places , getting all the coloured men out and all the white men into @entity11 which very much was , i suppose , the attitude of the time , ' she said			0
the @entity44 introduced in 1901 aimed to stop @entity46 immigration to @entity11 some families such as the @entity48 , were exempt from taking the @entity44 used to keep @entity11 @entity49 the game is also a reflection of the attitudes at the time , with the policy introduced with the @entity55 of the states into the @entity11 nation in 1901			1
legislation officially known as the @entity44 was passed in 1901 which aimed to restrict non-white immigration to the country			1
this legislation required all @entity46 people to sit for a ' @entity44 ' , which last until 1958			2
this required applicants to write out 50 words in any @entity49 language dictated to them by an officer			0
the @entity34 policy was introduced because of concerns about @entity46 settlement when @entity74 miners came @entity75 and @entity76 for the @entity77 in the 1850s and with the arrival of @entity80 to work in @entity82 's cane fields			1
the policy was reinforced in @entity84 by prime minister @entity85 , but then progressively dismantled from 1949 until it was finally abolished in 1973			0
travel , education or family were often reasons individuals could be exempt from taking the test this cartoon from 1936 shows tests were determined by the officer so could be pitted against applicants to ensure failure the @entity32 described the dictation test : ' as the language used was at the discretion of the officer , it was easy to ensure failure if an applicant was thought to be ' undesirable ' , either because of their country of origin , criminal record , medical history or if they were considered morally unfit			0
' ' despite the restrictive legislation , many @entity46 immigrants , including people from @entity109 , did enter or continue to reside in @entity11 during the period of the @entity34			1
' exemptions from the @entity44 were non-european coming for a specific period to work , to visit family or for educational purposes			0
