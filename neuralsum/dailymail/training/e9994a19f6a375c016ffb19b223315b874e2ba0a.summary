by @entity0 published : 13:07 est , 16 may 2012 updated : 13:13 est , 16 may 2012 a miracle moggy has baffled vets after surviving for two years as a stray - with metal wire tearing at its belly			1
@entity6 , who is at least two years old , first became trapped in the wire when she was just a kitten , medics believe			1
she has grown with the wire wrapped around her , leaving her with an abnormally skinny waist - and painful wounds where the metal cut into her skin			2
agony : x-ray showing wire wrapped entangled around @entity6 's stomach and under her skin amazingly , the feline was entangled for such a long time that her body absorbed the wire as her skin healed over it			1
@entity6 's horrific injuries only came to light after she was spotted by a concerned member of the public who saw the wire sticking out of her skin			1
@entity31 officers were called to catch @entity6 on thursday may 3 and immediately took her for treatment			2
it is believed the cat was living wild but had previously been a private pet , in @entity37 , @entity38			0
@entity31 inspector @entity39 said : ' the wire had actually cut slowly into the cat 's abdomen and was mostly under the skin , and the skin had subsequently healed over it			2
on the mend : @entity6 after the operation to remove wire from her stomach ' the likelihood is that this wire has been around the cat for a very long period of time , possibly from when she was a kitten			1
' i am actually amazed she managed to survive for so long , and had she had got an infection she almost certainly would have died			0
' i do not believe this wire was put on her deliberately , the likelihood is she got caught in it and could n't get free			0
' but this does act to as a timely reminder to people that they should keep any loose wire or hazards out of reach , as sadly , cats , small animals and wildlife can get caught in them , and it can cause a tremendous amount of pain and injury if this happens			0
' @entity6 will now be transferred to the @entity73 on @entity74 , @entity38			0
the @entity31 are also appealing to anyone who may recognise @entity6 or who may know who her owner is to come forward .			0

@entity6 became stuck in the wire as a kitten , say vets
skin healed over *initial* wounds and choked stomach
miracle cat survived into *adulthood* without infection
now on the mend after a *successful* operation
