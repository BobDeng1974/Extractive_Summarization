she won our hearts as @entity3 , by committing the unthinkable in @entity4 and gaining enough weight to be both apple - cheeked and pear - shaped			2
so you can understand why so many fans have expressed dismay at @entity11 ’s latest look			1
this weekend the actress – now size 6 – appeared at a fashion event in @entity14 showing off chiselled cheekbones , a heavy brow and a peculiarly smooth forehead			1
she was almost unrecognisable from the granny - pant - wearing @entity3			2
so what ’s happened ? changes : @entity11 's chiselled cheekbones , heavy brow and smooth forehead render her almost unrecognisable from her apple - cheeked look in 2007 although her management decline to comment , one @entity26 commentator remarked that she looked like she ’d been ‘ hit with a shovel of @entity29 ’			1
suspicions about surgical intervention notwithstanding , @entity11 is looking positively radiant these days			1
and that ’s largely down to a huge change in her lifestyle			2
the 44 - year - old has walked away from her acting career , favouring instead a stint as a director and producer , which has done wonders for her stress levels and love life			1
new love : @entity11 and guitarist @entity45 started dating almost a year ago , and were spotted on a romantic holiday in @entity47 together in february @entity11 has hinted that she felt close to a breakdown during her years on the @entity49 , during which she suffered the humiliation of a 128 - day marriage to country star @entity53 in 2005			1
@entity53 has since said that he ' panicked ' after their impulsive ceremony in the @entity56			2
@entity11 later remarked : ‘ i made the biggest mistake of my personal life			1
i was looking for something else			0
‘ i just needed to put acting aside			2
i needed to sit still and not to worry about the dresses and the hair and the travel and the interviews			0
i was going through huge life changes at the time			0
i wanted to stop and be a girl for a while			0
’ after the @entity53 disaster there was a heavy – if unlikely – flirtation with sir @entity72 , in 2007 plus a liaison with celebrity hotelier @entity74 , and another with comedian @entity75 , her co-star in @entity76			0
her 30s and early 40s passed from one short romance to another , with actor @entity81 and rockstar @entity82 of the @entity83 among her beaus			0
the parallels to @entity3 were often remarked on , a comparison which enraged and appalled @entity11 : ‘ i ’m not single , i ’m busy , ’ she told an interviewer , who enquired after her love life , before grimacing sardonically , ‘ that ’s my line			1
’ and now ? well , very quietly , @entity11 has found a new man			1
and at the relatively advanced age of 44 , she believes that she has finally found ‘ @entity93 ’			1
the man in question is tall , dark and handsome blues guitarist @entity96 , with whom she was at university in @entity98 , @entity99			1
it is an unlikely match			0
while @entity11 is clean living , @entity96 is an ex-heroin addict who once confessed : ‘ i thought it was cool to be a tough drinker and drug addict			1
familiar face : as @entity3 in 2004 sequel @entity106 with @entity107 and @entity108 ‘ from my experience , i think it is hereditary , and i think it gets worse every generation , especially alcoholism			0
‘ i work constantly on my personal life and go to therapy and aa meetings			0
’ his ex-wife is the musician @entity119 , a member of @entity121 ’s entourage in the @entity122 , with whom he has two daughters			0
regrets : following her 128 - day marriage to country star @entity53 , @entity11 said she ' felt a failure ' @entity96 and @entity11 started dating almost a year ago , and were spotted on a romantic holiday in @entity47 together in february			1
so what ’s the attraction ? ‘ @entity11 has always had a thing about musicians , ’ a friend tells me , ‘ and she thinks that this was fated to be , for them to find each other again after all these years			1
’ recent reports suggest that the pair are contemplating adopting a child			0
a friend told the website @entity144 : ‘ she knows that she probably missed the boat on carrying and giving birth to a child			0
‘ @entity11 tries to find the positive side of things , she knows 44 is n’t too old to be a mum			1
it will just have to happen a little differently than she always imagined it would			0
’ in the immediate future , @entity11 will appear in one more film , 4½ minutes			2
it ’s a comedy about a single mother who turns to a stand - up comedian to help her raise her genius child			0
she will direct and produce the film , and has spent several years raising the finance and working on the script			0
as for @entity3 , it looks like she has finally laid the character to rest : while the film company @entity166 did produce a script for @entity3 , which preceded @entity169 ’s new @entity3 book @entity170 , the project was shelved			0
there is also talk that she has fallen out with @entity172 , who noticeably failed to thank @entity11 in the foreword of @entity170			2
will her next project be starting a family with her guitarist beau ? it sounds very much as if it will .			2
