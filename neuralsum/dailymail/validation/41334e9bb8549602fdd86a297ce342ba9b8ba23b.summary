the widow of a retired police officer who shot dead two of their daughters before turning the gun on himself will receive $ 500,000 in death benefits despite earlier fears she 'd be left penniless			1
former @entity9 officer @entity8 had filed new retirement papers removing his wife as beneficiary just 10 days before he carried out the killings in @entity14 , @entity15 on february 21			1
it means that the state could recognize the original form - and it has indicated it will do so , the lawyer , @entity16 , told the newspaper			1
but she will likely still receive a payout ' she would have been left with nothing had this happened two weeks later , ' he said			2
' they could have decided to accept the other form ... but this saves everyone years of litigation			0
' we appreciate the state stepping up and helping the family in this critical situation			0
' @entity9 officials have also indicated that the city will cover health insurance for @entity43 , 50 , and her surviving 22 - year - old daughter , @entity44 , for 90 days , @entity16 said			1
he added that he hopes they can come to a longer - term agreement over the health insurance			0
@entity8 , 52 , retired from the @entity9 force after 22 years on january 30			1
three weeks later , when his wife and their older daughter were in @entity51 , he gunned down 17 - year - old @entity52 and 13 - year - old @entity53 with his 40 - caliber @entity54 as they slept			1
murdered : he shot dead 17 - year - old @entity52 and 13 - year - old @entity53 ( pictured ) as well as the family 's three dogs before taking his life on february 21			1
he and his wife had spoken about separating before the deaths left behind : his wife , @entity61 , second left , and their surviving daughter , 22 - year - old @entity44 , center , are pictured at funerals for the two slain teenagers he then killed their three dogs , typed out a suicide note on the computer and shot himself			1
mrs @entity43 asked @entity52 's teenage boyfriend to check the house because neither had been able to contact anyone there			0
he discovered @entity8 's body in the garage			2
he called police who found the girls ' bodies			0
@entity8 , who had no known health or psychiatric problems , apparently carried out the killings after he and his wife had spoken about a possible separation weeks earlier			1
before the murders , mrs @entity43 went to police to report a non-violent argument with her husband over an $ 80 cellphone bill because a friend had urged her to record such incidents			0
authorities said the suicide note , which was addressed to his wife and which included five or six pages of instructions on getting things in order , indicated that the killings were premeditated			0
scene : @entity52 's boyfriend found @entity8 's body in the garage after @entity101 asked them to check on her family			2
@entity104 later found the bodies of the girls , who had been shot in their sleep interviews with people who knew him found no one had an inkling that ' mr. @entity114 would have committed this heinous crime , ' said @entity14 police chief @entity116 last week			0
still , ' @entity14 police investigators discovered a suicide note at the residence indicating that the killings were premeditated by mr. @entity8 , ' he said			2
he added : ' it 's difficult , especially when you see two young girls , their lives have been ripped away , brutally murdered			0
you ca n't get any rationale for that ... the act is so incredibly bad			0

former @entity15 *cop* @entity8 filed new retirement papers that *barred* his wife from a payout just days before he killed their daughters and himself
but the state had not yet *processed* the form and so could *choose* to recognize the original form instead - which they have indicated they will do
@entity61 and her oldest daughter were out of town when he shot their daughters , 13 and 17 , while they slept on february 21
he also killed their dogs before shooting himself dead
@entity8 , who had retired from the @entity9 police just three weeks earlier , and his wife had spoken about a trial separation
