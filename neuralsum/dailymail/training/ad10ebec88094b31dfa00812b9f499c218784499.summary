by @entity0 there was finally some good @entity3 news for @entity4 last night			1
sadly , it did not come from @entity6 , where our footballers ’ have lost their first two qualifying games			0
instead , it was at the @entity11 in @entity12 , @entity13 , where @entity4 ’s under - 20s triumphed over @entity15 to retain the title they had won in @entity18 last year			1
dressing room heroes : @entity4 's @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22 in action : @entity24 of @entity4 makes a break during the final of the @entity11 yesterday ’s game ended 21 - 20 , with a nail - biting finish which would have been familiar to football fans – except that it ended with our team ’s victory			1
commentators praised @entity4 ’s defence and attack , with tries from our promising young players @entity21 and @entity39 as the team came from behind to beat the @entity41			1
@entity44 fly - half @entity42 , who scored two penalties and a conversion for @entity4 , said after the match : ‘ absolutely buzzing			1
' obviously that last 20 minutes was real nail - biting and to get through it is a massive achievement and full credit to the boys , we deserved that			1
winners : @entity24 fends against @entity55 of @entity15			2
the nail - biting game - held in @entity12 , @entity13 , finished in a 21 - 20 victory for @entity4 victory : @entity42 of @entity4 makes a break			1
the team were praised for their defence and attack by commentators watching the final ‘ we ’ve worked hard all campaign , it ’s been tough but to come through and win something like that at the end of it just shows how hard we ’ve worked , so it ’s real satisfying			1
’ @entity42 is the younger brother of @entity73 , who is due to line up for the senior @entity4 side in the third test against the @entity76 in @entity13 , today			0
his father ’s side have lost the first two tests			0
their success came as @entity4 crashed out of the world cup			0
fans were left in ruins once more after @entity84 upset the odds by beating @entity86 1 - 0 - condemning @entity88 's men to an early @entity3 exit			0
in their worst performance in the tournament since 1958 - losses to @entity86 and @entity91 in their first two fixtures mean they will be leaving @entity6 before the knockout stages			0
their future in the tournament was left hanging by a thread last night after @entity101 led the @entity103 side to a 2 - 1 win in @entity106 - leaving @entity4 bottom of @entity107 final : @entity22 and @entity21 of @entity4 celebrate their victory			2
promising player @entity21 was praised for his scoring a try during the epic last match of the competition their fate was still in the balance today , but @entity118 's 44th minute header led @entity84 to a shock 1 - 0 win against the @entity121			2
a victory for the @entity123 would have given @entity4 a glimmer of hope going into their final fixture - but the result leaves it mathematically impossible for them to qualify			2
the nation has spent months watching football - themed adverts , seeing streets and shops taken over by @entity133 's flags , and hearing hours of punditry explaining why this could be @entity4 's year			1
but after just two group games in @entity6 , @entity4 fans were left with that all too familiar feeling of anti-climax this morning , as they woke to hangovers following yet another night of bitter disappointment			0
celebration : @entity4 players take pictures in the dressing room retaining their title former captain @entity147 accepts a ' naive ' @entity4 did not deserve to stay in the @entity3 , but is confident the young squad will grow stronger from the disappointment of @entity6 2014			0
' @entity150 for me would have been a better place with @entity4 in it , but you have to earn the right to stay in a tournament			0
unfortunately for us , we have not done that , @entity147 said on @entity158			0
' maybe we were a bit naive in situations , in the game yesterday when we got back into it at 1 - 1 , we had a chance to get a point and dust ourselves down , to say ' right , we are ready for the last game when everything is going to be on it , ' but we did not give ourselves the opportunity			2

@entity4 's under - 20s triumphed at @entity11
yesterday 's game against @entity15 ended in nail - biting 21 - 20
commentators praised @entity4 's defence and attack in *victorious* game
