by @entity1 reporter published : 01:07 est , 12 october 2013 updated : 06:16 est , 12 october 2013 it was only a matter of time - welcome to @entity4 's first e-cigarette bar			1
the @entity5 has just opened up among the pop - up galleries and boutiques on the border of @entity9 and @entity10 and is being hailed the ' hookah bar of the now '			1
owner @entity12 even went as far to say she wants the space to become ' like @entity14 '			0
so what exactly is an e-cigarette bar ? according to @entity12 - a reformed smoker who , like many , turned to electronic cigarettes to kick her habit - it is both a shop that aims to help smokers ( or ' vapers ' , as e-cigarette users have come to be known ) find the perfect device for them , as well as a hang - out where you can ' vape ' , drink cold - pressed juices and eat from a vegan menu			1
just opened : the @entity5 , an e-cigarette bar , is the first of its kind in @entity4 , offering a place for ' vapers ' - e-cigarette smokers - to hang out and sample new devices and flavors available oh - so - chic : the @entity5 is located at 23 @entity38 in @entity9 , right near the @entity10 border candy store of e-cigs : there seems no end to the flavors of vaper available , from cherry to ' mr @entity46 '			1
there is a patio out back and a coffee bar @entity12 developed @entity50 , a company that purveys e-cigarettes , after being unimpressed by the e-cigarettes available at the time			2
' ( they ' ) did n't have the throat hit of a real cigarette , ' she told @entity58			0
now the @entity5 is her first real store and the first e-cigarette bar of its kind			1
they are like - minded spots in @entity63 and @entity64			2
while the medical community continue to debate the heath effects of e-cigs , the consensus is they are much better for you than regular cigarettes			1
while e-cigarettes still administer a hit of nicotine - the amount of which you can test and buy at the @entity5 - they are without the tabacco and chemicals contained in regular cigarettes			1
according to the @entity80 , smokers recieve some 7,000 chemicals from each cigarette			0
' we have 30 - year smokers who have switched over and are suddenly running again , ' @entity12 says			2
' i feel like i 'm doing something good for the world when that happens			0
' try before you buy : some of the flavors available , known as ' e-juice ' , which is inserted in the e-cigarette to flavor the vapor they produce @entity50 founder @entity12 developed her own e-cigarette after being dissatisfied with what was available on the market two years ago , when e-cigarettes were relatively new			0
e-cigarettes have since been outlawed on all @entity100 flights original : @entity50 started with standard cigarette - style offerings before expanding into flavors strength : 24mg is the most nicotine on offer @entity5 staffer @entity107 , whose title is officially ' vapologist ' , guides patrons through the flavor and device pairings			1
' it 's product knowledge - knowing how much of what flavor to vape , ' he said			0
' we want to show people this is cool			0
we 're the hookah bar of the now			0
' the @entity5 features a red floor , disco balls and mismatched vintage furniture			2
although it is being called a bar , there is no alcohol available because it does n't fit with the ' health ' theme			1
the headlining feature however are the available flavors of vaper , known as ' e-juice '			0
they start predictably with watermelon and vanilla and go to the crazy like @entity135 , @entity136 , happy ending .			0

the @entity5 in @entity9 claims to be the first of its kind
*fashioned* like a juice bar with a health - *oriented* theme
medical community still up in arms about effects of e-cigarettes
