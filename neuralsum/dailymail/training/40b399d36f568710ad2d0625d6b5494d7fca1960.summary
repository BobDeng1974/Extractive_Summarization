by @entity1 correspondent we should cut funding for opera and give more money to brass bands , the former head of the @entity3 said yesterday			1
@entity9 – who was in charge of the government ’s arts spending until last year – admitted organisations such as the @entity14 should be forced to raise more private money rather than rely on public funds			2
perhaps surprisingly for a woman who presided over the nation ’s cultural elite for four years , she even claimed to prefer the brass bands of working - class northern towns to the music of @entity23 and @entity24			1
money matters : the former head of the @entity3 @entity9 said funding for opera should be cut , and more money given to brass bands she told the @entity30 : ‘ brass bands can be as excellent as opera , no question			1
indeed if you ask me , i ’d rather listen to a brass band mostly			0
‘ the funding for opera is historic and extraordinary and it is an exception to all rules ... it is completely bizarre and extraordinary			0
’ earlier this month , @entity41 mp @entity40 – whose constituency is in @entity43 , west @entity39 - revealed brass bands only received £ 1.8million in @entity3 funding over the past five years , compared with £ 347million for opera			1
he asked @entity46 why brass bands were considered to be an inferior art form , and whether opera should be forced to raise more money on its own			1
she agreed that although the @entity14 , in @entity54 ’s @entity53 , was a ‘ beacon of excellence ’ , it could survive with less money			2
she said : if i was left to myself i would fund early and late opera , i would n’t fund the middle at all			0
i have 19th century opera			0
so i would fund @entity62 and @entity63			0
that would be much cheaper			0
@entity65 : dame @entity46 agreed that although the @entity14 , in @entity54 's @entity53 , was a ' beacon of excellence ' , it could survive with less money tradition : dame @entity46 said she preferred the brass bands of working - class northern towns , such as the one depicted in 1996 film @entity73 , to the music of @entity23 and @entity24 ‘ it is capable of raising a very great deal of private money and the more pressure that is put on the @entity14 in particular to raise that money privately is good policy			1
’ she said it would be impossible to spend the opera budget all on brass bands , but added : ‘ you probably could put the squeeze on @entity53 a bit more			2
’ dame @entity46 was appointed chairman of the @entity3 in 2009 but was asked to step down by former culture secretary @entity88			1
she was criticised last year for spending £ 8,130 of public money on her leaving party at the @entity91			0
the @entity3 reclassified the event as a lecture in an already approved part of its budget .			0

@entity97 head @entity9 says opera funding should be cut
she says she prefers the brass bands of working - class northern towns
brass bands received £ 1.8m in @entity3 funding in last five years
dame @entity46 says @entity14 could survive with less money
