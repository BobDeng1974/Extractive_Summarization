she claimed @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19 in the @entity2 - and later made additional claims for @entity21 and @entity22			2
after suspicions were raised in 2012 following a tip - off and her benefits were stopped , she returned to the @entity2 and was arrested			2
investigations showed she had taken her children out of school in 2006 - but when confronted over the blog posts she initially claimed they were ' a figment of her imagination ' , and said the content could n't be relied upon			1
@entity0 insisted she only spent eight to 12 weeks at a time in @entity3 where she rented a property and denied doing anything wrong			1
it was only after lengthy investigations , carried out by the @entity37 , which included translating stamps on her passport from @entity41 and going through her bank account transactions - that she finally admitted her crimes			0
@entity0 has now pleaded guilty to five offences of failing to notify a change of circumstance and failing to disclose information			0
at @entity48 on friday , @entity49 , defending , said his client had not been living the ' life of @entity52 ' in @entity16			0

the court heard ms @entity0 - who arrived in a mobility scooter - began making legitimate benefit claims in 1993 , including disability living allowance on the grounds she had extensive mobility restrictions			2
@entity0 , pictured arriving at @entity67 from @entity3 , was caught out after she returned to the @entity2 , but when confronted over the blog posts she initially claimed they were ' a figment of her imagination ' but they became fraudulent in 2006 when she took her two children out of school and moved from her home to start a new life in @entity76 , @entity3			1
mr @entity53 said that over the following six - and - a - half years she continued living in @entity16 , with a pattern of spending several months to a year there at a time , with occasional return visits to her @entity12 home , usually for a week or two before flying back out to @entity3			1
in 2009 she submitted a claim for child tax benefit , filling in a form saying she lived in the @entity2			0
two years later an income support review form was filled in to allow her to continue claiming , which the prosecution said appeared to have been completed by someone else at her request as she was in @entity3 at the time			2
in early 2012 , @entity0 submitted a further form for @entity21 , on which she gave her @entity12 address but declined to provide a mobile number - and also requested three weeks notice for any face - to - face assessment			2
mr @entity53 said : ' she said she would need that time for a carer to accompany her to an interview			0
the crown suggests that was to allow her time to come back from @entity3			0
' defending , mr @entity49 said it was an ' unusual ' case as she would have been entitled to those benefits if she had been living in the @entity2 , and said it had n't been a cynical and calculated plan but something she fell into and let continue			0
