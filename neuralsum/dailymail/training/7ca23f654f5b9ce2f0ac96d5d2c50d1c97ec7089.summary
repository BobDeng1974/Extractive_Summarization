this is the moment an a leopard and a hyena had a power lunch of a very different kind			2
the two hungry beasts engaged in an epic tug of war over a zebra carcass after the big cat killed it , but found its prey too heavy to drag back to his tree			1
a small pack of crafty hyenas smelt the carcass , and after baring its teeth and growling at the leopard , one decided to cheekily sneak a few bites			2
tug of war : the leopard grips the zebra carcass in its jaws , as the sneaky hyena creeps in to take a nibble and steal his catch mine all mine : the leopard kills the zebra and grips it in its mouth , while keeping an eye on the hyena which is closing in do n't even try : the leopard straddles the zebra carcass and turns its head to make sure its prized kill is n't at risk of been stolen biting down : the leopard takes a mouthful of the zebra , whose ears are already torn to pieces after a violent half hour tussle , the leopard was victorious and dragged his kill away so he could finally feast in peace			1
the culinary tug - of - war was captured at the @entity53 , @entity54 , by photographers @entity56 and @entity57			1
mr @entity56 , a 55 - year - old teacher from @entity58 , said ' it was exceptional ' to see the food fight , which is a rare sight			0
he said : ' the leopard had killed a young zebra but it was impossible to carry it up into his tree			0
dinner for one : the leopard at the @entity53 in @entity54 bears its teeth and tries to scare the hyena off i 'm hungry too : the hyena howls at the leopard and signals that its not going to let the big car eat alone creeping in : the hyena decides it ca n't wait any longer and charges in to challenge the leopard for the zebra carcass aerial maneuvers : the leopard tries to move the carcass at speed while keeping a close eye on the darting hyena eye to eye : the leopard and the hyena square off over the zebra carcass which they both grip in their jaws and refuse to let go ' several hyenas were attracted to the smell and at first the leopard gave up and walked away			1
' he then came back and wanted to carry the kill away but the hyenas were n't going to give up without a fight			0
' mr @entity56 said after 30 minutes of ' vicious pulling and gnashing of teeth ' the leopard was victorious and strode away .			0
