most pregnant women ca n’t help but feel apprehensive about the pain that they will experience when they give birth , but the consequences of not feeling anything at all are far more horrific			2
@entity7 , 34 , did n't suspect a thing when her fourth child , @entity9 , came into this world in may , 2012			1
in fact , she thought that she had soiled herself			2
it was n’t until she noticed her baby ’s head dangling between her legs that she realised in horror that it was arriving four months too early			2
’ @entity7 , who lives in @entity21 , @entity22 , with her husband @entity23 , 50 , had already had three children ; @entity25 , nine , @entity26 , eight , @entity27 , four , by the time she fell pregnant with @entity9			1
so she knew that when her waters broke just after 23 weeks of pregnancy that something was very wrong			2
she said : ‘ i did n't expect it to be an early birth at all because my three other pregnancies were all full term			2
' i had been quite ill just a couple of weeks before , i had a very bad throat infection around 21 weeks pregnant , which turned into streptococcus a. ‘ then ten days later i lost my mucus plug and i started wobbling – just three days later , my waters broke			2
’ @entity9 in @entity41 at @entity42 @entity7 was rushed to @entity21 hospital but the staff there were unable to deal with babies born more prematurely than 27 weeks and instead arranged for her to be admitted to @entity42 hospital , two hours drive away			1
after administering her with an injection that helps babies to develop lungs in the womb quicker if they are at risk of premature birth , @entity7 was taken by ambulance to @entity42			1
@entity9 weighed just 1lb when she was born once there , @entity7 had just two days to settle in before the shock birth occurred			1
she said : ‘ i thought i had to go to the toilet - i thought i had been blocked for several days but unconsciously had not been wanting to let go because of the baby			2
‘ as i went into the bathroom , i thought i had defecated , but there was a mirror in front of the toilet and as i looked up , i saw this tiny little head between my legs , so i knew what was happening			2
‘ i pulled the emergency cord and within seconds , the midwives and the neonatal intensive care unit were there			2
‘ two of the midwives supported me while the third one helped to deliver @entity9			1
‘ i did n't feel anything because she was so small			0
‘ she was as big as my hand , she fitted on my hand - she was really , really small			0
‘ luckily i was in hospital because she was given to the doctors within seconds and they put breathing tubes in her			2
’ but being born so premature was n’t the only battle facing @entity9 , she had also severely ill after picking up streptococcus a and b from her mother			1
@entity7 said : ‘ she was infected by the streptococcus a and b , because in the meantime i had also developed streptococcus @entity87 ‘ so , as she came out and we were n't prepared , she picked that up too			1
‘ she was pus - covered , she was smelly , she made no attempts to breathe and she also had two small bleeds in her brain - it did n't look very positive			0
’ @entity7 practised reiki and psychic surgery on her daughter alongside traditional medicines given by the @entity99 but while the future looked bleak for her daughter , @entity7 , who works as a spiritual healer , says that as she was put back into her hospital bed and her baby was rushed to the intensive care unit , she was possessed by total calm			1
she said : ‘ i had this spiritual calm come over me , knowing that i had to do the healing i 've learnt and that all would be well			0
‘ the comments from the doctor were n't good because that 's how the situation was , but i refused to have any negative dust in my mind			0
’ as the doctors used their traditional medicine on @entity9 , @entity7 supplemented it with @entity118 and what she called ‘ psychic surgery ’			1
she believes it was a combination of these two methods that enabled @entity9 to fight through			1
father @entity23 with his daughter @entity9 in hospital @entity7 said : ‘ i would do @entity118 , which is universal energy giving			1
‘ it was like her physical battery was very low and mine was full , so by putting my hands on her , i charged her battery			0
‘ it comes from my head , through my hands , into her body and this made her able to fight better and overcome everything			0
‘ i would also do psychic surgery , which is healing with the mind			1
‘ i would imagine her blood with the bacteria in it and imagine sucking it out of the blood , so i can see it flowing beautifully			0
‘ it 's all about the positive mind and intentions			0
‘ i strongly believe it was the collaboration between medical and spiritual healing that made her so good			0
’ when @entity9 was taken home , she has to continue to be given oxygen after four months and two days in hospital , @entity9 was finally well enough to go home			1
doctors took the precaution of hooking @entity9 up to a portable oxygen tank for the following eight months			1
@entity7 said : ‘ she was on home oxygen but an incredibly small amount - 0.02 of home oxygen so a very low flow			1
‘ but that 's because it was in september and autumn was coming , so they took no risks			0
‘ it was quite difficult because a small baby is attached to oxygen anywhere you go			0
‘ you have a bottle underneath your pram and everyone is looking at you and wondering what 's wrong with your baby			0
‘ she was on that until april - a month before her first birthday and then she just came off it			0
’ @entity9 is now a healthy two year old girl @entity7 ( right ) with @entity9 , and her other children from left : @entity26 , eight , @entity25 , nine , and @entity27 , four since then , the family have n’t looked back – @entity9 is now as healthy as any other child her age			1
@entity7 said : ‘ she sailed through for a baby who had given birth ill and so early			1
‘ one in ten who are born that prematurely are healthy and have no long term problems , but she was n't just premature , she was also ill when she was born			0
‘ most children born at this age have chronic lung disease , but she has been followed up by the @entity99 incredibly well			0
the healing of the 1lb baby by @entity7 ‘ these @entity193 [ babies born before 26 weeks gestation ] are also at the risk of major eye problems , blindness , healing problems , growth problems and development problems in movement			1
' ' but the specialist told me even when she was one year old that she ’s a miracle			0
’ ‘ she went to nursery when she was one year old and she has had no more coughs and colds than any other children			0
’ ‘ i saw the specialist in @entity211 six months ago and she has fully caught up with her age group which is a miracle for that kind of baby			2
‘ i 'm 100 per cent convinced that it was the co-operation between the spiritual and medical			0
‘ she 's very special			0
' all of my children are special to me but when you go through something like that , it makes them extra special			0
