by @entity0 published : 04:35 est , 12 june 2013 updated : 18:28 est , 12 june 2013 @entity2 : ' case would n't have been necessary if @entity3 had been fair ' a @entity5 oil tycoon lost his landmark divorce battle against his ex-wife in the @entity8 yesterday and was ordered to pay her £ 17.5million			1
@entity9 , 50 , one of @entity5 ’s most successful black businessmen , argued that he could not pay his former wife as his assets were owned by his companies , not by him			1
but the court ruled that property worth £ 11million was held ‘ in trust ’ for him by companies he controlled and owned and ordered their transfer to @entity2 , 49			1
yesterday ’s ruling sets a precedent because it reverses a previous judgment that had barred mrs @entity2 from obtaining the properties as they were separate legal entities under corporate law			1
that decision had raised the prospect of wealthy husbands being able to ‘ bury ’ their assets in companies they own to protect them from generous divorce settlements			2
the @entity30 , who have four children , have spent almost £ 3million in legal fees contesting the divorce settlement following the break - up of their 15 - year marriage in 2008			2
the @entity8 heard that the couple were based in @entity38 but also had properties in @entity40 and the @entity41 and lived to a ‘ very high standard ’			1
mrs @entity2 had been seeking a payout of more than £ 30million , plus more than £ 730,000 a year to meet the ‘ reasonable needs ’ of her and their children			1
mr @entity9 , whose business was valued at £ 2.5billion in 2007 , had offered her £ 27,000 a year and a lump sum of less than £ 2million			0
in 2011 , the @entity49 ordered that mr @entity9 should transfer a £ 4million property in @entity38 to his wife and make a lump sum payment of £ 17.5million			0
he was told to transfer seven @entity5 properties owned by his company , and worth £ 11.3million , to his wife to partially meet the lump sum payment			1
the tycoon was also told to pay maintenance of £ 24,000 a year for each of his four children , along with school fees and medical bills			0
multi-millionaire @entity9 , 51 , lost a lengthy legal battle over what he should pay his ex-wife @entity64 , 50 his companies challenged the @entity49 decision and won their case in the @entity68			1
but it led to mrs @entity2 taking the battle to the @entity8			1
the case revolved around the question of whether courts had the power to treat assets owned by a company as belonging to the person controlling the company			2
marriage law states that assets to which the ‘ party is entitled , either in possession or reversion ’ can be transferred to a spouse in a divorce settlement			0
the court concluded that the properties were held ‘ on trust ’ for mr @entity9 by his companies and that the ‘ particular circumstances ’ of this case allowed them to order the transfer of the assets			1
the judges reflected on the @entity49 ’s criticism of the businessman in their ruling , saying he had failed to comply with court orders ‘ with particular regard to disclosing evidence ’			0
the @entity101 home of multi-millionaire businessman @entity9 who tried to keep his fortune from wife they said : ‘ the court inferred that the reason for the companies ’ failure to co-operate was to protect the properties , which suggested that proper disclosure would reveal them to [ be ] beneficially owned by the husband			1
’ it found that mr @entity9 had employed ‘ obstruction , obfuscation and deceit ’			0
mrs @entity2 , who still uses her married name , looked visibly relieved as the judgment was read out yesterday and said it was ‘ more a case of satisfaction ’ than celebration			1
‘ none of this would have been necessary if @entity3 had been sensible and played fair , ’ she said			2
lawyers said that today 's decision would have far - reaching implications for couples divorcing in the future her lawyer , @entity129 , said : ‘ the @entity8 ’s decision will ensure that dishonest husbands ca n’t cheat their wives and flout court orders by hiding behind a web of deceit and a corporate façade			1
’ mr @entity9 did not attend			0
his lawyer , @entity137 , argued that the companies ’ assets were ‘ held in trust ’ for his children and those of his siblings under @entity40 law			0
he argued that a £ 10,000 bequest from his @entity40 father after he died in 1992 was the ‘ seed money ’ that built his oil empire and his brother has begun a separate claim			0
several of mr @entity9 ’s companies are also appealing against the divorce payout			2
lawyers said today 's ruling would have important implications for divorcing couples in future lawyers today spoke of the far - reaching impact of today 's @entity8 ruling			1
@entity161 , family partner at @entity38 law firm @entity162 , said : ' if the @entity165 decision created a " @entity171 's charter " by allowing someone to hide their assets behind the corporate veil , this ruling has ripped it up			2
' it says husbands who use company structures for dishonest purposes will come unstuck			0
' it also says that even when husbands have assets held within a company but who are not trying to circumvent claims by their spouses dishonestly – the nature of those assets and how they became corporate assets will be looked at closely by the courts to establish true ownership ... ' it should allow spouses where their spouse has put assets used by the family into a structure to sleep a little more easily			0
' @entity194 , a specialist family lawyer at law firm @entity195 , said the ruling was a ' landmark '			0
she said : ' the ruling confirms that , if someone is the sole owner of a company , then if the court is satisfied that those assets are held by that company on trust for one party , they can be used as part of a divorce			0
' it means that business people can not deliberately " hide " their assets in businesses and corporate structures to protect them in future in the event of a divorce			0
' @entity217 , a partner at law firm @entity218 , said : ' the @entity8 has handed down a landmark decision in which , for the first time since at least the end of the19th century , it has accepted a general exception to the rule against ' piercing the corporate veil '			2
' this is an extraordinary decision and the implications for corporate governance are potentially huge			0
' businesses and lawyers will be poring over the judgment for some time to try to understand its limits			0
' @entity233 , a senior partner at @entity234 , went on : ' the @entity8 's decision is a victory for common sense			1

@entity9 , 51 , lost his @entity8 fight against ex-wife @entity64 , 50
high - *profile* ruling ended lengthy legal battle over what counted as assets
@entity8 ruled that seven properties owned by his companies counted as his
after today 's decision mrs @entity2 said her husband should have ' played fair '
case will have implications for couples whose marriages fail in future
