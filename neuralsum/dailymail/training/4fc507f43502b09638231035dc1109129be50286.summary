@entity0 has been branded ' silly and dangerous ' after blaming immigrants for clogging up @entity3 's roads for him missing an event charging @entity7 supporters to meet him			1
the @entity7 leader said he arrived too late for a £ 25 - a - head drinks reception in @entity10 because the @entity3 's ' open door immigration ' policy meant that the @entity12 ' is not as navigable as it used to be '			1
and he vowed to continue speaking his mind , warning he will not be ' brow beaten ' into becoming a ' vanilla ' politician , despite a storm of criticism over his suggestion that breastfeeding women should sit in a corner			1
but he had been due to mingle with paying guests at a reception on friday night			2
around 100 @entity7 members paid £ 25 each for tickets for the event at the @entity35 in @entity36 , @entity10			1
but the leader failed to turn up , hours after complaining that his chauffeur and security is paid for by @entity7 and not the taxpayer			1
in an interview broadcast yesterday , mr @entity0 blamed immigration for there being too many cars on the roads to make the 180 - mile journey from @entity47 to @entity10 in south @entity48			1
and he hit back at criticism that the no - show was further evidence of his party lacking professionalism			2
he told @entity23 : ' it took me six hours and 15 minutes in the car to get here			0
it should have taken three - and - half to four			0
' that has nothing to do with professionalism			0
what is does have to do with is a country in which the population is going through the roof , chiefly because of open door immigration and the fact the @entity12 is not as navigable as it used to be			1
' in all these years in @entity7 that 's probably about the third event out of a thousand that i have n't made in time			2
' mr @entity0 complained that the @entity12 , linking @entity47 to south @entity23 , was the ' not as navigable as it used to be ' @entity7 mep @entity70 said it was right that mr @entity0 led from the front a senior @entity7 figure has appeared to suggest that @entity0 is a ' control freak ' in the way he runs the party			1
@entity70 said policy decisions were a ' sort of collective operation ' but mr @entity0 is the ' dominant figure ' in the party			1
the economic spokesman announced that @entity7 could look at introducing a luxury goods levy - quickly dubbed the @entity88 tax - at the party 's annual conference but was slapped down within hours by the leader			1
he told @entity90 's @entity89 ' that one did n't make the cut , no '			0
mr @entity70 added : ' it 's not just @entity0 , but clearly we have a party leader who leads , which is a bit of an innovation in contemporary politics			1
' he added : ' i remember @entity99 in my days as a journalist saying to me you are either a control freak or you have lost control			1
' and , if you have to decide which side of that fence to go on then having control is probably the right option			0
' asked if that meant it was the ' @entity0 show ' , he replied : ' well , @entity0 is the dominant figure in the party who has transformed us from a 3 per cent party to a 18/20 plus party			1
' @entity116 , @entity117 's shadow welsh secretary , said : ' remarks like these are what makes @entity0 so dangerous			1
' it is clearly absurd to suggest heavy traffic on the @entity12 is caused by immigration , but through the laughter at his silly comments you can hear @entity7 's dog - whistle politics of division			1
' last week it emerged that @entity7 pays £ 60,000 - a - year for mr @entity0 to enjoy the services of a chauffeur			1
mr @entity0 was also challenged about whether he has regrets about any of his more outspoken comments			2
on friday he trigged a row when he suggested mothers of newborn babies should avoid being ' openly ostentatious ' when breastfeeding and might think about sitting in a corner when doing so			0
he has previously complained about people not speaking @entity140 on trains and said people would not want a group of @entity144 living next door			2
but he was unrepentant , telling the @entity23 : ' i look at politics			0
i look at the incredibly bland people that are now in politics who dare not give an opinion on any issue for fear of criticism			0
' is it any wonder the public do n't know their names , do n't know what they stand for			0
' you know we have finished up with vanilla politics , right across the @entity3			2
' i am going on , saying it as i see it			0
but i am not going to be brow beaten by you and everybody else into becoming like the rest of them			0
' meanwhile mr @entity0 has been accused of recruiting ' toffs for the top ' of @entity7 after a candidate in a key target seat expressed fury that he had been ousted in favour of a star of the tv programme @entity181			1
@entity182 , a wealthy , retired hotelier who features on the @entity184 programme , has been parachuted in as mr @entity0 's candidate in @entity186 and @entity187 , where the sitting @entity189 mp holds a wafer - thin majority			2
now the deposed candidate has given vent to his anger in a leaked email to local party members in which he condemns @entity7 's policy of recruiting defecting @entity189 mps and celebrities			1
@entity201 calls on @entity7 members to bombard mr @entity0 with complaints about his treatment , and claims that his party boasts ' standards of democracy lower than the unelected @entity208 '			1
mr @entity182 , 55 – whose @entity181 appearances with his wife @entity210 and two of their four children have included discussions about whether @entity7 is racist – was selected for the seat last week shortly after mr @entity201 was removed in a coup which he says was orchestrated by the party 's head office			2
last week mr @entity0 complained about not having taxpayer - funded travel and security , which is given to other leaders like @entity221			2
he told @entity222 : ' you look at all the other leaders of political parties , they of course , all have the state provide them with , you know , the means to get around , and with security			0
the state does n't provide @entity7 with anything			2
' he said he had written to the government asking for state help with his security bills , but it had been refused			0
he suggesed he should be given the same level of protection as ' any former @entity239 '			0
' i 'm not having an argument over it , the fact is we do n't get help			0
do i need ( a ) security ? yes			0
and do i need to be driven around from place to place ? i think i probably do			0
' i mean , i came up here early this morning , i 'm off to @entity248 in a minute to give a speech			0
i think i do actually need ... so there is a team , there are two guys who are with me and take me round the place			0
' and if that 's being interpreted by one national newspaper as somehow i 'm now living high on the hog , in this luxury 4 x 4 car , all i would say to the newspaper that writes stuff like that is , come and spend a week with me , you 'll be half dead by the end of it			0
