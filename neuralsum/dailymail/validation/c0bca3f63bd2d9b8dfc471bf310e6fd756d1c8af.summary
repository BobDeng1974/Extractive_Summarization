@entity0 yesterday left the door open to a @entity4 - @entity3 coalition after the general election – as the latest polls point to a ‘ @entity7 ’ of nationalists storming @entity9			1
in a speech to party members in @entity13 , led by @entity14 , the @entity4 leader ignored calls from his own frontbench , led by shadow chancellor @entity17 and health spokesman @entity18 , to rule out a deal with @entity21 ’s party			1
last week a poll by @entity24 peer lord @entity23 put the @entity3 on track to increase its representation at @entity9 to 56 of @entity28 ’s 59 seats , up from just six seats now			1
they include @entity39 in @entity40 who , as @entity41 has previously reported , left aggressive messages about the monarchy during the @entity44 – including the line ‘ off with their heads ’ – and @entity46 , aged just 20 , who has talked about headbutting her @entity4 opponents in @entity49			0
the @entity3 ’s projected success could cancel out @entity4 gains in other parts of the @entity55 , leading to a dead - heat between the two main parties – and allowing nationalists to play ‘ kingmakers ’			1
many @entity4 mps think the only way to avert a humiliating collapse is for mr @entity0 to tell voters he wo n’t deal with the nationalists , to persuade anti- @entity66 voters that a vote for him is the only way to remove @entity69 from @entity70			1
however mr @entity0 barely mentioned the @entity3 at the @entity4 spring conference			1
the @entity4 leader said : ‘ the @entity24 could wreak havoc in @entity28 without winning a majority by being in government as the largest party			1
’ @entity39 - @entity40 @entity39 is an unreconstructed republican who tweeted ‘ off with their heads ’ during the @entity44 in april 2011 and said ‘ this might be a good time to declare a provisional government ’			0
unreconstructed republican : @entity39 @entity49 and @entity81 the student , who is tipped to beat the shadow foreign secretary @entity83 at the age of just 20 – which would make her the @entity55 's youngest mp – wants to headbutt ‘ fat - cat @entity4 councillors ’ and tweets about her boozy antics			0
future mp ? 20 - year - old student @entity46 @entity91 @entity92 was suspended in 2008 from his job as head of planning and development at @entity97 , a @entity28 police force , after circulating an unflattering email about his boss			0
@entity92 : @entity91 @entity101 @entity102 issued a call to arms to nationalist supporters in january , with the volunteer activist urging voters to take the opportunity to ‘ hold @entity9 ’s feet to the fire ’			1
@entity102 : @entity110 @entity111 and @entity81 the ex-soap actress was a @entity24 and then briefly a @entity113 member before she signed up to the @entity3			0
as a @entity24 she described @entity114 as ‘ hopelessly out of his depth ’			0
ex-soap actress : @entity111 - @entity118 @entity120 - @entity119 @entity120 boasted that she used @entity4 campaign literature to wipe her bottom			0
the councillor , who could topple former @entity4 deputy leader @entity124 , also wrote in 2007 about her @entity4 rivals : ‘ can i hope some of them keel over ? ’ @entity119 : @entity120 @entity128 - @entity127 , @entity129 and @entity130 @entity128 posted messages on social media last month praising anarchy in @entity134			2
the oil engineer said : ‘ it ’s about time we did like the @entity134 and disempowered the corrupt self - serving establishment parties			0
’ @entity128 : @entity127 , @entity129 and @entity130 @entity140 - @entity139 the former member of the @entity142 told november ’s @entity3 conference that the @entity55 has a ‘ disastrous economy whose banking system is an organised criminal conspiracy ’			2
@entity140 : @entity139 but he failed to spell out whether his own party would be willing to strike a deal with another party if it does not win a majority			0
mr @entity69 responded by raising the spectre of a left - wing axis between @entity4 and the @entity3			2
he said : ‘ if you thought the worst outcome for this election was a @entity4 government led by @entity0 , think again			2
' you could end up with a @entity4 government led by @entity0 – propped up by the @entity3 – an alliance between the people who want to bankrupt @entity55 and the people who want to break up @entity55			1
' and even today , @entity0 will not rule out a deal or backing from the @entity3			1
if he cares about this country he should do so			0
’ an @entity3 spokesman said : ‘ the @entity3 are fielding an excellent team of candidates to give @entity28 a powerful voice in the @entity169			2

@entity0 leaves door open to @entity4 - @entity3 coalition after the election
@entity4 leader ignores call from his frontbench to rule out deal with @entity3
poll puts @entity3 on track to secure 56 of @entity28 ’s 59 seats at @entity9
