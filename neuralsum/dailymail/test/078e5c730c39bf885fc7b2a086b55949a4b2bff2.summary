@entity0 has posted annual sales exceeding the £ 1billion mark for the first time in yet another sign of the discount stores ' sustained challenge to established supermarket retailers			1
the company , which began as a single shop in @entity9 25 years ago , has become @entity11 's largest single - price discount retailer			1
the firm revealed yesterday total revenue over the 12 - month period - excluding its @entity15 interests - grew 11.8 per cent to just over £ 1.1 billion , breaking through the £ 1bn barrier for the first time and matching more established retailers such as @entity19			1
@entity0 has become @entity11 's largest single - price discount retailer , with a trial expansion into @entity15 currently underway profits are expected to be around £ 44million as the firm reaps the rewards from its 547 @entity25 stores and 41 shops in @entity27			1
with recession - era shopping habits entrenched , discount retailers are taking sales from @entity25 's ' big four ' supermarkets - transforming the @entity25 @entity33			1
' discounters have always been part of the retail scene , catering for people who did n't have a lot of money , ' retail analyst @entity34 told @entity42			0
' what happened was that in 2011 the @entity25 became a country that did n't have a lot of money and bargain hunting became a national pastime and not just the preserve of people on low incomes			0
' @entity50 ( pictured ) founded @entity0 in 1990 then sold it for £ 50 million a decade later @entity0 said it had opened 60 net new stores in the @entity25 and @entity27 and had a strong pipeline of openings for the new year			2
on the back of yesterday 's figures , @entity0 's chief executive @entity55 said : ' after a solid quarter of sales growth , @entity0 's revenue for the 2015 financial year was over £ 1billion for the first time			1
' despite tough trading conditions , @entity0 continues to perform well and we served an average of 5.3 million shoppers a week during the quarter			2
' we managed our costs and cash well , and we expect underlying pre-tax profits to be in line with market expectations for the year as a whole			0
' originally founded by entrepreneur @entity50 in 1990 , the company snowballed from a small private enterprise into a @entity33 revolution , which involved buying up unwanted stock and end - of - lines , then swiftly getting them into the shops to sell cheaply			0
this strategy has since been adopted by bargain chains such as @entity81 and @entity82 , all of which have eaten into a market once dominated by the supermarket chains such as @entity86 , @entity87 and @entity88 's			0
back then , shoppers were beginning to desert the @entity33 for superstores , but mr @entity50 and his @entity0 chain - which he sold in 2000 for £ 50million - were a lifeline that helped keep it afloat			1
@entity50 grew up helping his father run a stall at @entity84 in the @entity96 , before opening his first @entity0 store in 1990 at the age of 18			2
he has previously said his inspiration was his hardworking father , who ditched his job to become a trader when he realised it brought in more money			0
and it was at his father 's market stall he discovered the basics of business			0
most significantly , he realised the box contain cut - price items that had lost their packaging was particularly popular			1
the box formed the inspiration for @entity0 , and a few years later , he convinced a shopping centre in @entity9 - on - @entity117 to open a store , where he sold £ 13,000 of stock on the first day			2
by the time he sold his share of the company for £ 50million in 2000 , the business had a million customers a week and employed 6,000 people .			0

the discount chain yesterday posted annual sales exceeding £ 1 billion
it has now become @entity11 's largest single - price discount retailer
@entity0 benefited from *austerity* seen in the wake of the financial *crisis*
it also transformed @entity137 , *luring* customers away from superstores
