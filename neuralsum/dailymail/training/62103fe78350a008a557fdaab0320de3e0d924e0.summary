@entity15 , @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18 were also named as having fabulous pins and tootsies			0
hairy legs , pale skin and hard skin on feet particularly leave @entity24 women unwilling to make the most of the sun and the survey found that almost half of women will cover up their legs by wearing jeans instead of skirts			1
and it ’s not much better on the feet front ; almost half of women will opt for pumps instead of sandals because they ’re embarrassed to let anyone see the hard skin on their feet and cracked heels			1
only 15 per cent of women think that their feet look good in a pair of sandals			2
summer ready : @entity25 says she gets the most compliments about her legs when she 's kept up her grooming routine @entity25 says : ‘ it ’s no wonder women keep their legs and feet covered up when they feel unprepared to bare their skin			1
i know i tend to hide in a pair of skinny jeans and ballet pumps when i ’ve neglected my legs and feet			2
‘ however , i get the most compliments and feel best about myself when i have taken the time to ensure my legs are smooth and hair - free and that my feet are well cared for			2
’ it is cost that is putting most people off getting summer - ready , with over three quarters of women saying the price of treatments at salons is an issue			0
feeling embarrassed and lack of time are also reasons women are deciding to take grooming into their own hands			0
hairy no more : @entity24 women named lack of tan and hairy legs as the top reasons for staying covered up ‘ as a model i have learnt how to take care of my body and make sure it ’s always looking its best ’ , says @entity25			1
‘ i feel most confident when i ’ve carried out my beauty basics such as waxing and foot care			0
it ’s not just about how great your legs and feet look , but how you feel once they are prepped and ready to bare as soon as the sun comes out			0
' ' any mum with a full time job knows that fitting in time to do even the simple things like going to the gym and shops can be a struggle , never mind finding the time to visit a salon			0
that ’s why products like @entity110 that are quick and easy to use at home are a god send			0
' pampering time : hard skin on our feet and cracked heels have us reaching for our pumps instead of showing off in summer sandals @entity25 has certainly been busy lately , revealing her new range of figure - hugging summer dresses for @entity123 on wednesday			1
