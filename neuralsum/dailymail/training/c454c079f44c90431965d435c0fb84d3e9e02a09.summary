a gun range owner says she wants to ban all followers of @entity3 from her business claiming the religion ' commands them to kill ' her			1
in a rambling and bizarre blog post , range owner @entity7 wrote that she does n't consider @entity3 to be a religion — and as such @entity10 should n't be allowed protections under the @entity13 @entity12			1
' why would i want to rent or sell a gun and hand ammunition to someone who aligns himself with a religion that commands him to kill me ? ' wrote @entity7 , who claims she 's been the target of threats by @entity10 before			1
the @entity34 , - based @entity33 has asked attorney general @entity35 to investigate the @entity36 in @entity37 on the grounds of racial and religious discrimination			1
the group 's attorney , @entity40 , says the move could ' inevitably result in a hostile environment for ordinary @entity10 in @entity22			2
' @entity7 cited the terrorist attacks of september 11 , 2001 , and the @entity46 bombings and some of the reasons to mistrust @entity10			2
@entity7 said some of her patrons were ' frightened ' when two men with ' @entity52 ring tone and message alert tones ' — the @entity55 phrase meaning ' @entity56 is the greatest ' — walked into her range recently			2
@entity7 is the owner of the @entity36 ( pictured ) in @entity37 , @entity22 ' they spoke very little @entity59 , one did not have proof of @entity13 citizenship , yet they wanted to rent and shoot , ' @entity7 wrote			1
' they were constantly glancing toward the cameras in the range , then looking at each other and speaking in their own language			0
' their behavior was so strange , it frightened my patrons			0
no one would enter the range to shoot while they were there			0
some of my customers left			0
i lost business and the people who remained at my facility said they did so out of fear for my safety			2
' @entity7 was unavailable for comment when sought by @entity84 on thursday evening			2
in a phone call , an employee at @entity36 said @entity7 is considering changing her business into a private shooting club			1
' as such , we can say who may or may not be a member , ' the staffer said			0
' we do n't ask anybody what their religion is , we do n't care			2
' they come in here and act normal , we do n't have a problem			0
' bizarrely , @entity7 seems to justify her @entity3 - free idea on the advice of agents from the federal @entity103			1
she claims two agents told her ' if we feel any reason for concern about selling someone a firearm , even sense that something is not right about an individual , or if we are concerned about that [ person 's ] mental state , even if they pass a background check , we do not have to sell that person a gun			0
the @entity33 has asked the @entity13 @entity31 to investigate @entity7 ( pictured ) on ground of racial and religious discrimination she added : ' i understand that not all muslims are terrorists			1
i also believe there are as many @entity10 who do not know what is in their @entity122 as there are @entity124 who do not know what is in their @entity126			0
' since i have no way of discerning which @entity10 will or will not kill in the name of their religion and the commands in their koran , i choose to err on the side of caution for the safety of my patrons			0
' the @entity33 sent a copy of its letter to @entity22 gov. @entity139 , the @entity140 of the @entity31 , the @entity13 attorney for the @entity141 of @entity22 and the @entity103 's regional office in @entity143			1
responding to the letter , she wrote in her @entity147 page : ' i ’ve been a target of @entity149 threats for five years			0
. fully expecting at any time one of them to follow through with the threat			0
i may go down for speaking the truth about @entity3 ... … i may lose everything i have , ( which is n't much ) but they ca n't take my integrity ... this is a mountain i ’m willing to die on …			1
