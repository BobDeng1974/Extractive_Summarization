surrounded by tulips waiting to bloom , it stands in what parishioners call the ' sunken garden ' along @entity50 and is the site of the annual may crowning			2
mens said the statue has been there for at least as long as the 21 years he has been at @entity34			1
@entity57 , religious education secretary at @entity15 , said her daughter @entity58 , an aide in the fourth - grade monday night class , told her about the tear			1

it was gone by early afternoon			0
mens saw the photo but was reluctant to read anything into it			0
' everything we need to know for our salvation has been made known , ' @entity76 told @entity80			1
