@entity0 has hit back at attacks from @entity3 chairman @entity2 and other @entity5 officials , claiming they were the ' most disrespectful ' thing he had ever experienced			1
@entity2 had told @entity0 at a meeting of @entity10 countries on tuesday his claim that racism was behind @entity14 corruption allegations in the @entity16 media was ' offensive and totally unacceptable '			2
@entity19 @entity3 president @entity18 also told @entity0 in blunt terms that he should step down from @entity21 next year and not stand for a fifth term			1
' @entity0 's position has been hugely strengthened however after @entity21 delegates dealt a crushing blow to moves to bring in term limits and age limits for officials			1
it effectively giving the green light to @entity0 to stand for re-election next year			1
@entity10 and a number of @entity5 federations , including the @entity3 , had proposed bringing in limits but that was defeated in a vote at @entity21 's @entity26 in @entity27			2
the decision leaves the way open for 78 - year - old @entity0 to stay in office next year - and for many years beyond - and he made it clear to @entity21 's 209 member nations that he intends to stand again			1
he told delegates : ' the candidature period is not yet open so no one can be a candidate			0
i know that my mandate will finish next year on june 29 in @entity65 - but my mission is not finished			2
' and i tell you together we will build the new @entity21 together			2
we have the foundations today			0
@entity26 will decide who will take this great institution forward			0
ready : @entity0 has indicated he is ready to seek a fifth successive term ' it 's a tough decision but i can tell you i am ready to accompany you for the game , for the world - but it is your decision			2
' the vote on limits came towards the end of a lengthy meeting where @entity0 made the light - hearted suggestion that football could one day be played on other planets			2
he also told delegates that the governing body was still involved in governance reforms			0
' we are still in our reform process but we are at the end , ' he said			0
' our basic values of football of discipline , respect and fair play could be brought in everywhere in the world then we would have realised our objective , but our objective never finishes			0
' from north to west to east and south ... and we shall wonder if one day our game is played on other planets and then one day we wo n't have the @entity14 , we will have interplanetary contests			0
' meanwhile former @entity3 chairman @entity103 used a speech in the @entity105 to liken @entity21 to ' a mafia family ' and @entity0 to @entity107			1
@entity0 refused to respond to @entity103 , the initial chairman of @entity110 's bid to host the 2018 @entity14 who has previously claimed four @entity21 members sought bribes in return for votes			1
@entity103 said : ' @entity21 , i 'm afraid , behaves like a mafia family			2
it has a decades - long tradition of bribes , bungs and corruption			0
' about half of its executive committee who voted on the last @entity14 have had to go			0
vote : @entity21 's 209 member associations at the 64th @entity26 in @entity27 , @entity28 ' even its past president @entity126 has been removed from his honorary life presidency in his 90s			1
' systematic corruption underpinned by non-existent investigations where most of the accused are exempt from the investigation make it impossible to proceed			0
' foreign construction workers dying in their dozens in @entity137 stadium construction sites are essentially ignored			0
' speaking during debate on the @entity140 , he applauded the stand taken by current @entity3 chairman @entity2 against the ' grotesque ' accusation by @entity0 that criticism was racist			1
he told peers : ' @entity107 , i believe , would have recognised the tactics and he probably would have admired them			0
' @entity21 's 209 member associations rejected proposals to introduce term mandates and age limits for its elected executives at the world soccer governing body 's annual @entity26 on wednesday			1
members were asked to approve or reject the ideas in principle and , although majorities voted against both proposals , @entity21 did not give an exact vote count			1
associations voted by holding aloft green or red cards because the electronic voting system in @entity27 's conference centre was not working			1
@entity5 soccer 's governing body @entity10 was the only one of the six regional confederations to support the proposals but several delegates called the ideas unfair and restrictive			0
' we are completely against these changes , ' @entity171 , president of the @entity3 , said to loud applause			0
' we are working in a democratic system and that is the system that needs to prevail			0
' @entity21 president @entity0 , who had originally said his current mandate which ends next year would be his last , has since indicated he is ready to seek a fifth successive term			1
the 78 - year old @entity179 has been @entity21 boss since 1998			1
