but @entity5 beholds more than just a few trees and clouds from his desk at work ... he gets to see the whole world in shimmering panorama			0
and now the @entity13 - based commercial airline captain and photographer has taken pictures of his cockpit and posted them online			1
he says he began the project in a bid to document his daily routine through a series of otherworldly images that look more like oil paintings than photographs and reveal exactly what it is like for pilots at 35,000 feet			1
stunning view : @entity13 - based @entity5 sees more than just a few trees and an open space from his desk at work ... he gets to see the whole world in shimmering panorama @entity32 : this photograph is of a 1st officer enjoying the sunrise at 37,000 feet above sea level en route to @entity38 into the light : he says he began the project in a bid to document his daily routine through a series of stunning photographs that reveal exactly what it is like for pilots at 35,000 feet the only trouble is , when it gets a bit stuffy , he ca n't open the window as any normal office worker would			1
he said : ' i take you far away from skyscrapers and high rise building roof tops this time to somewhere much higher : welcome to my daily office ! ' he gives the images their ethereal look through a technique called ' exposure bracketing ' which involves setting up a dslr camera to take at least three shots , each at a different exposure , before combining them to create the final print			1
great view : @entity5 usually has to be behind the camera to take pictures of the cockpit but here he turned the camera on himself motherboard : apart from the beautiful views that confront @entity5 each day he takes to the skies , his pictures also remind viewers of the incredible array of levers , panels and buttons that cover almost every inch of an aircraft 's cockpit hometown : @entity5 took this picture as he flew over his hometown @entity13 the result looks more like an oil painting on canvas than a real - time digital photograph			1
apart from the beautiful views that confront @entity5 each day he takes to the skies , his pictures also remind viewers of the incredible array of levers , panels and buttons that cover almost every inch of an aircraft 's cockpit			2
and , of course , he knows his way around them just as well as he does around those on his digital slr camera			0
but @entity5 's portfolio does n't end inside his cockpit			0
as a pilot he says he developed a keen interest in how the world looks from above			0
so he went about climbing to the top of buildings and skyscrapers to picture cities from above			0
branching out : but @entity5 's portfolio does n't end inside his cockpit ' close up ' : this is an aerial view of the artificial @entity110 in @entity13 on top of the world : @entity5 often uses a fish eye lens to bend the horizon beyond its natural curve a view from a bridge : but very rarely , @entity5 likes to take pictures from underthings rather than over them @entity121 : @entity5 's braketted exposure technique gives many of his cityscapes a dark edge , almost as if taken from a post-apocalyptic comic book rings and roundabouts : one of @entity5 's favourite times to photograph @entity13 is at night when the city lights up in a kaleidoscope of colour @entity132 - nother world : as a pilot he says he developed a keen interest in how the world looks from above			2
dusk or dawn ? so he went about climbing to the top of buildings and skyscrapers to picture cities from above menacing : @entity5 paints a picture of a world without limits tallest in the world : @entity13 has a skyline that is not only one of the world 's most iconic but also the tallest			2

he says , ' i take you far away from skyscrapers this time to somewhere much higher : welcome to my daily office ! '
gives pictures ethereal glow by setting camera to take three images at different exposures which he then combines
