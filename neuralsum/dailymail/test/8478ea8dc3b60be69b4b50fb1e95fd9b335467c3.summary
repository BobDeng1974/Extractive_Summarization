a @entity1 nuclear submarine suffered £ 500,000 damage in a collision while tracking @entity5 vessels , @entity6 can reveal a @entity1 nuclear submarine suffered £ 500,000 damage in a collision while tracking @entity5 vessels , @entity6 can reveal			1
the 5,300 - ton @entity9 limped back to port with a huge dent and will be out of action for several months			1
@entity14 top brass are investigating the incident			2
last night , defence officials refused to disclose exact details of the crash – including where or when it happened – but they were adamant that @entity9 struck ‘ floating ice ’ rather than a @entity5 sub			1
but the collision , which ripped a 6ft hole at the top of the conning tower , comes at a time of heightened tension between @entity1 and @entity5 in the airspace over the @entity30 and beneath the waves			2
@entity1 is understood to be mounting frequent patrols of the @entity30 and areas as far north as the @entity34 , while the @entity5 have increased their submarine activity by half in the past 18 months			2
@entity14 sources say the damage to the nuclear - powered submarine , which will cost as estimated £ 500,000 to repair , is consistent with striking an object while trying to surface			1
surfacing can be a risky manoeuvre because sonar equipment on a submarine tends to look ahead for threats rather than above			0
in addition , radar scanners do not work underwater			0
after the crash , engineers from @entity9 ’s 130 - strong crew found that the impact had devastated the submarine ’s outer layer of acoustic tiles			1
these square - shaped 2in - thick tiles minimise the vessel ’s transmission of sound waves and other signals that could reveal her position			1
the @entity14 ’s explanation that @entity9 struck ice was also used to explain damage to @entity1 submarines during the @entity67 which was later found to have been caused by enemy vessels			1
in 1981 , the crew of @entity70 were ordered to say they had hit an iceberg after their collision with the @entity5 submarine @entity74			0
@entity9 , which was launched in 1988 , is a ‘ hunter - killer ’ submarine used to attack ships and other submarines , and also to perform a surveillance role			1
she is fitted with @entity82 cruise missiles , cameras and thermal imaging periscopes			0
in 2009 , she suffered loss of primary and alternative power supplies to her nuclear reactors			0
@entity14 sources insist there was no such power problem on this occasion			2
above , the submarine is pictured before the crash off the @entity99 coastline a @entity14 source said : ‘ striking ice is a problem of the environment we work in			2
some patches of ice show up on our scanners but not all , with the density of the ice also being a factor			0
on this occasion some damage was sustained by @entity9			1
‘ a submarine is a very pressured environment and a lot can go wrong			0
you ’re in a tin can under the sea tracking @entity5 subs and trying not to get found ourselves			0
@entity9 ’s captain , helmsman and her officers will have been making multiple calculations simultaneously and working in very testing conditions			1
’ the activity of @entity1 ’s fleet of nuclear submarines is strictly classified			0
last night , the @entity14 would say only that the incident happened last year			0
the submarine was photographed last month on her arrival at the @entity133 at @entity134 , where the repairs are taking place			0
a @entity14 spokesman said : ‘ @entity9 suffered minor superficial damage after striking some floating ice last year			1
she remained fully operational and continued with her deployment			0

5,300 - ton @entity9 has a huge dent and will be out of action for weeks

it will cost an estimated £ 500,000 to repair , navy sources have claimed
