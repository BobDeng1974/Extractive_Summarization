the stakes are too high			0
@entity6 - whether you like it or not , you 're stuck with me ' @entity6 governor @entity1 governor @entity1 , the famously blunt , budget - cutting governor in office not even two years , had spent the past few days reconsidering his long - time refusals to run for the presidential nomination			1
he stoked the speculation with a high - profile speech last week at the @entity83 presidential library in @entity84 , @entity85 , where he reiterated that he was n't running for president			2
he also held a tour to help raise money for republicans in @entity90 , @entity85 and @entity91			0

' @entity137 , @entity138 ' @entity1 ’s decision not to run for the @entity4 presidential nomination is hardly a surprise			1
