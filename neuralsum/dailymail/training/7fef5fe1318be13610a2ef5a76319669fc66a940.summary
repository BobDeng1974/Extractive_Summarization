’ he has responded with an emergency package of measures within days of a @entity32 poll , published last friday , which revealed more than four in five people do not want unrestricted access to the @entity35 for @entity16 and @entity17			1

‘ in 2004 , the @entity104 made the decision that the @entity35 should opt out completely of transitional controls on the new @entity5 member states			1
they had the right to impose a seven - year ban before new citizens could come and work here , but – almost alone in @entity12 – @entity22 refused it			0
that was a monumental mistake , ’ mr @entity0 writes in an article for the @entity116 today			0
he will say : ‘ that was the moment to address difficult questions about when to allow new entrants full access to each others ’ labour markets – but the @entity104 ducked these questions			0

if after three months an @entity5 national needs benefits – we will no longer pay these indefinitely			1
’ he will say : ‘ they will only be able to claim for a maximum of six months unless they can prove they have a genuine prospect of employment			0
we are also toughening up the test which migrants who want to claim benefits must undergo			2
deputy prime minister @entity146 said : ' these are sensible and reasonable reforms to ensure that the right to work does not automatically mean the right to claim ' ‘ this will include a new minimum earnings threshold			0
if they do n’t pass the test , we ’ll cut off access to benefits such as income support			2
‘ newly arrived @entity5 jobseekers will not be able to claim housing benefit			2

‘ @entity35 , as part of our plan to reform the @entity5 , will now work with others to return the concept of free movement to a more sensible basis			1
‘ and we need to do the same with welfare			0
for example , free movement should n’t be about exporting child benefit – i want to work with our @entity178 partners to address this			1
’ the pm will say he wants to look at various options to stop surges of immigration			0
‘ one would be to require a new country to reach a certain share of average @entity5 gdp per head before full free movement was allowed			1
individual member states could be freed to impose a cap if their inflow from the @entity5 reached a certain number in a single year			2
‘ i look forward to working with other countries who also want reform – and to putting the choice about our future in @entity12 in a referendum			0
’ deputy prime minister @entity146 said : ‘ these are sensible and reasonable reforms to ensure that the right to work does not automatically mean the right to claim			0
