the newly - wed mother - of - two claimed she had been attacked by a stranger as she walked home from babysitting for a friend			1
her worried husband immediately told her to contact police and report the crime			1
her bogus claim came as police investigated a number of other reported rapes in her local area			1
but detectives quickly exposed her lies and found she had sneaked off to meet lover @entity27 - just a short walk from her marital home			1
police then uncovered a series of texts on her phone and @entity34 admitted she had been cheating on her partner for six years			1
@entity34 admitted perverting the course of justice and was given a suspended prison sentence of eight months , suspended for a year			1

' this was all at a time when there was an ongoing investigation into rapes in the @entity51 area			0
' on letting her walk free from @entity54 crown court judge @entity53 added : ' this is an extremely exceptional case			0
' i do so with some reluctance and it is really by the skin of your teeth			0
' @entity62 , prosecuting , said she left her marital home in @entity51 , @entity65 on the evening of september 24 , telling her husband she was visiting a friend called @entity68			1
@entity11 , 32 , had only been married to partner @entity2 , 41 , for four weeks she left the house at 8.15pm and texted her husband saying she had arrived at the property			1

mr @entity62 said : ' @entity1 was lying to her husband at that stage			2
in fact she had arrived at the home of a @entity27			1
' mr @entity34 , washed and shaved , put the children to bed and settled down to watch a film			0
by this time mrs @entity1 was having sex with her lover			2
' at 10.10pm @entity34 left her lover and arrived home 10 minutes later in floods of tears claiming she had been raped			1
bogus : @entity1 pictured with her husband @entity2 who told her to contact the police on the advice of police her husband bagged her clothes before detectives arrived to question her			1
mr @entity62 added : ' she gave the police an allegation of stranger rape after being confronted by a man who she had struck			0
' she had then been shoved to the ground and her trousers and underwear were pulled down and she had then been raped			0
' but the court heard that her story began unravelling when her friend revealed that she had not been at her house			0
officers then examined @entity34 ’s mobile phone and discovered sexual texts between her and her lover			2
@entity34 told the court she was upset at herself and said ' things had spiralled out of control			2
' she also claimed she had gone to her lover ’s house ' under threat ' as he was going to tell her husband about the affair			2
' this is an extremely exceptional case ' judge @entity53 @entity116 , defending , said : ' it was mrs @entity1 ’s belief that , unless she consented to this blackmail to have sex with him on that particular day , he would tell her husband			2
' in effect , that her lover would pull the plug on her entire life			0
' mr @entity116 added that @entity34 was suffering from mental health issues and blamed problems as a child for her difficulties with men			0
after her initial appearance in court she was sent to a hospital to be treated for mental health problems			0
judge @entity53 said : ' sadly , in this case , the allegation of rape proved to be untrue but was not admitted until after extensive inquiries had been carried out by detectives , at a time when there was understandable public concern about a number of earlier assaults being carried out in the @entity51 area			2
' i would echo the comments by @entity53 that this strikes fear into the hearts of women and undermines actual victims			0
