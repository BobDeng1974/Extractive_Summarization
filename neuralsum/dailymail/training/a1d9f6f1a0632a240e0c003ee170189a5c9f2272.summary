and that is exactly what happened when the underage guitarist of an @entity7 band was refused entry to his own gig			1
the @entity11 - based band @entity12 were due to play in a @entity14 bar during a tour of the @entity16 , but were told that because of a strict over 21s door policy the lead singer and guitarist would not be allowed in			1
the bizarre situation was caught on film and quickly shared online			0
since it was first aired , the video of the band playing their song has exploded online , garnering over half a million views since debuting over the weekend			0
the film has since earned the band a few more fans , particularly on their @entity49 site , with the viral video shared across the world			0
mr @entity26 said : ' we were informed by the doorman that even though i was simply performing , not drinking , that i could not enter the bar because i was underage			1
the bizarre situation was caught on film and quickly shared online - garnering the band more fans overseas ' we were not informed of the bar 's policy in advance of the show and did n't expect any trouble since we had never had any problems of the sort in our homestate of @entity11			1
' we asked the doorman if we could load in anyhow and we located a mailslot that lead outside the bar nearby the stage			0
' we ran our cables through the mailslot i could play and sing along to my band performing inside			1
the band was muffled but audible from outside and we were able to play our set without any major hiccups			2
' it was hilarious to perform to the streets of @entity14 and watch the faces of confused passerby			1
people came from inside the bar to watch as well			2
all in all , it turned out to be a fun and creative solution to the problem and certainly beat going home unpaid that night			0
' in 2007 , @entity90 folk singer songwriter @entity89 was refused entry to her own gig in @entity93 because she was just 17 at the time			2
people who had traveled to see her play instead found her busking outside the venue .			0
