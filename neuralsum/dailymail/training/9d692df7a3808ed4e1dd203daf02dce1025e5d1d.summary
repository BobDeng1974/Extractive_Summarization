@entity0 is the latest in a long , terrifying list of killers , rapists and other serious criminals able to slip into @entity5 using @entity7 free movement rules			1
the authorities here had no idea he had a conviction for murder when he used his @entity15 passport to enter the country in 2007			2
this is because while demanding @entity7 citizens should have the right to free movement – except in the most extreme circumstances – @entity22 does not compel member states to share information on known criminals who might be planning to travel			2
he is now the prime suspect in the hunt for missing schoolgirl @entity31 , 14 some do : @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 and , most recently , @entity37 flag up potential dangermen to the @entity5 so they can be put on a watch list and turned away at the port or airport			1
but @entity43 officials say most of the @entity45 countries which joined the @entity7 in 2004 do not bother and some do not even keep the information for their own internal use			0
home secretary @entity49 is trying to put pressure on other @entity7 countries to cooperate , particularly in relation to child sex offences			0
but , ultimately , other countries know that they have countless free movement directives on their side – and there is zero chance of a blanket travel ban being implemented on their citizens if they do not cooperate			0
indeed , they may even take the view that they would rather have their murderers and rapists living in @entity5 than claiming new victims at home			1
equally disturbing is that even if the @entity15 had cooperated @entity69 would probably still have been free to waltz into the country			0
@entity71 ( left ) served 11 years in prison in the @entity73 for murdering his wife before moving to the @entity5 , where he was jailed for 12 years for attacking four women			1
@entity77 ( right ) was jailed for nine years for raping a seven - year - old in @entity79			0
he then raped a woman in the @entity5 and was jailed for life mobster @entity82 ( left ) was wanted for a string of offences in @entity37 when fled to @entity5 , where he killed a man with a blowtorch and was jailed for 30 years			1
@entity89 ( right ) was a convicted armed robber when he moved to the @entity5			1
he was accused of murdering a couple when he was found hanged in his prison cell normally , a person can be excluded from the @entity5 only if they pose ‘ a genuine , present and sufficiently serious threat ’ to society and the public			1
they key here is ‘ present ’ , which means it is not enough for an @entity7 citizen to have a serious criminal conviction			0
the @entity105 must prove they are likely to strike again which , given @entity69 was convicted of murder in 1998 , might have fallen foul of @entity7 edicts			0
the same is true when the authorities are trying to boot out an offender from elsewhere in @entity113 who has committed an offence here			2
had the police known about @entity0 ’s past , they might have begun proceedings to remove him in 2009 , when he was accused of indecently assaulting a 14 - year - old girl in @entity122 , west @entity123			2
but given no case was brought , they again might again have struggled to prove he was a ‘ present ’ danger			0
indeed , officers might have concluded the chances of success were so low that it was n’t worth the trouble – particularly since @entity0 would probably just head straight back to the @entity5 through our still lax borders .			1

authorities were *unaware* when murderer @entity0 moved to the @entity5
he is now prime suspect in the hunt for missing schoolgirl @entity31
he is the latest in a list of killers and rapists who have moved to @entity5
