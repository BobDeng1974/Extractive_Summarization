@entity2 star @entity1 will plead not guilty to allegations that he abused his four - year - old son by severely whipping him with a wooden switch , it was claimed today			1
in a statement to @entity7 , @entity8 , a spokesman for @entity1 's lawyer @entity10 , said : ' if the court asks for a plea tomorrow [ and we do expect that to happen ] it will very definitely be not guilty			1
' she added that she hoped a trial date would be discussed at the 29 - year - old 's initial appearance at court in @entity21 , @entity22 , but said : ' we do n't yet know how the court 's docket is looking			1
' it comes as @entity1 has posted a series of tweets criticizing the public for ' believing anything ' following a shocking report on his previous antics and charity by the @entity35			1
' despite the timing of his message - just hours after the report accused his charity of improperly using tens of thousands dollars worth of funds - he later added : ' just in - general ! ' @entity1 , who has been sidelined for most of this season , allegedly left his son with visible wounds to his thighs , backside and genitals following the ' disciplinary ' beating at his @entity22 home in may			1
he is due to appear at court at 10am tomorrow on charges of reckless or negligent injury to a child			1
it is not known whether he will be asked for a plea or given a trial date			2
unless mr @entity10 is able to secure a quick trial date - a task that typically takes around nine to 12 months - and convince a jury that @entity1 did not violate @entity22 's corporal punishment law , it is likely the player 's 2014 season is over			1
' i hope we learn more tomorrow , ' ms @entity8 said			0
' but it 's possible that we wo n't get a date tomorrow and we 'll just get the beginnings of discussions about a date			2

' i am someone that disciplined his child and did not intend to cause him any injury			1

he was the only player invited to a groundbreaking ceremony for the team 's new stadium			1
he is seen here with owner @entity202 a photo showed the boy suffering from a head wound covered by two bandages , while other images revealed a scar over his right eye			0

i never imagined being in a position where the world is judging my parenting skills or calling me a child abuser because of the discipline i administered to my son			2
' i voluntarily appeared before the grand jury several weeks ago to answer any and all questions they had			0
before my grand jury appearance , i was interviewed by two different police agencies without an attorney			0
in each of these interviews i have said the same thing , and that is that i never ever intended to harm my son			0
i will say the same thing once i have my day in court			0
' i have to live with the fact that when i disciplined my son the way i was disciplined as a child , i caused an injury that i never intended or thought would happen			1
i know that many people disagree with the way i disciplined my child			0
i also understand after meeting with a psychologist that there are other alternative ways of disciplining a child that may be more appropriate			0
