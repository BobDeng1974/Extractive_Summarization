her own mother bucked the royal trend for traditional baby names when she opted for @entity4			1
so it is not surprising that new mum @entity6 decided against going with family favourites such as @entity8 or @entity9			0
yesterday the @entity8 ’s grand - daughter and her husband , former @entity12 rugby captain @entity11 , announced they had named their daughter @entity14 ( pronounced @entity15 ) for no other reason than ‘ they both liked the name ’			1
@entity14 shot into the chart of the country ’s most popular baby names at number seven last year , with 3,524 new @entity27 in the country			1
in marked difference from last week ’s formal @entity32 announcement of her birth , the news was announced by @entity11 on @entity35			1
he posted : ‘ for everyone who has asked what our daughter ’s name , it ’s @entity41			0
’ @entity4 ’s spokesman , @entity42 , told the @entity43 : ‘ there is no family connection , no relation with the name , it ’s just pure coincidence			1
they both just really liked the names , particularly @entity14			2
’ announcement : @entity11 and @entity6 have revealed that the name of their daughter is @entity14 modern : the baby 's name was revealed by the proud father via @entity35 today bookmakers @entity58 dropped its odds on the name from 16/1 to 5/1 after a surge of bets in the minutes before the announcement			1
‘ there was a late surge of betting for “ @entity14 ” , with one punter wanting £ 300 on the name , ’ spokesman @entity65 said			1
‘ normally the money that comes in on royal baby names tends to be quite small			2
a little here , a little there			0
so when someone attempts to put a relatively large amount on all of a sudden , it tends to arouse our suspicions			0
‘ we decided not to take the bet and do a little checking to see if the information was out there , and as we were checking the information came in			0
’ @entity14 is of both @entity83 and @entity84 origin and means ‘ mine ’			2
in @entity87 , it means ‘ beloved ’			0
@entity14 is a more traditional name , which has long been used to represent the concept of divine grace			2
in a royal context , it was made famous by @entity93 , the @entity94 actress who married @entity95 and was considered a global icon of style and glamour			0
birth : @entity4 , pictured shortly before the birth of @entity14 , left hospital just six hours after the baby was born @entity4 gave birth last week to the 7lb 12oz girl , who is 16th in line to the throne and is the @entity8 's fourth great - grandchild			1
@entity11 also took to @entity35 after the birth to describe his joy at becoming a father for the first time , saying it was ' definitely the best day of my life '			1
however , the couple predicted they would take some time to come up with a name because they had chosen not to be told the sex of their child in advance			0
@entity4 , a silver medal - winning @entity123 who is one of @entity126 's leading equestrian riders , gave birth to her first child at @entity129 with her husband at her side			1
she is the daughter of @entity9 , but does not hold a royal title after her mother decided not to pass on her status to her children			1
@entity14 will also not hold any royal or aristocratic title			1
when @entity4 herself was born , her name was likewise a break from tradition as it had no precedent in the royal family			2
grandmother : princess @entity9 last week at the @entity145 estate , where her grandchild is believed to be staying with @entity6 and @entity11 a new arrival : @entity4 's brother @entity148 and his wife @entity149 were seen leaving the estate after welcoming @entity14 into the world with a wide circle of friends and family that includes an eclectic mix of royalty , rugby players and racing folk , there ’s no shortage of candidates for the role of @entity14 's godparent			1
the @entity164 and @entity165 are both possible options as is prince @entity167 , because @entity4 is known to be close to her cousins and is godmother to @entity170			2
another royal who could be asked is @entity4 ’s brother @entity148 or his wife @entity149 , and other windsors such as @entity173 and @entity174 are also in the frame			2
@entity4 ’s best friend , racehorse trainer , @entity176 , is a likely choice - @entity4 is already godmother to her seven - year - old son @entity177			0
ms @entity176 was also a maid of honour at @entity4 ’s 2011 wedding to @entity11 , where she shared the honours with @entity181 , @entity4 ’s 15 - year - old half - sister and another potential godparent			0
the use of @entity35 to announce the name of the baby stands in stark contrast to how the birth of her second cousin @entity170 was revealed to the world			1
when the son of prince @entity193 and the @entity165 was born last year , the official announcement of the birth came on an easel placed outside @entity32			0
@entity4 has said that she plans to return to riding as soon as possible following @entity14 's birth - just like @entity9 , who did not allow becoming a mother to interrupt her sporting career			1
in an early sign of her no - nonsense approach to motherhood , @entity4 left hospital last week after just six hours and returned to the @entity145 estate in @entity129 , where she was joined by @entity9 and by her brother @entity203			1
the early betting was on a more traditional name for the new royal baby with @entity206 , @entity207 , @entity9 and @entity8 among the front runners			0
but bookmakers @entity58 said @entity14 entered the betting yesterday afternoon at odds of 16 - 1 and finished as the 5 - 1 favourite			0
spokesman @entity211 said : ' it looks like a few people managed to get @entity14 correct and we have now lost for the second time running			2
' we might have to close that betting early for the next royal baby - be it @entity193 or @entity167			0
' home : the latest addition to the royal family will grow up on @entity9 's @entity145 estate near @entity222 rider : @entity4 plans to resume her career as a top horsewoman following the birth of her daughter the baby girl follows @entity4 's brother @entity148 ' two children and @entity170 to become the @entity8 and the @entity232 's fourth great grandchild			1
@entity148 ' daughters @entity148 and @entity234 were also born at @entity129 in @entity235			0
@entity4 and mr @entity11 moved back to @entity9 's @entity145 estate last january after selling their regency home in @entity240			0
hospital : @entity14 was born on january 17 at the @entity129 the pair first met in a @entity244 bar when mr @entity11 was in @entity245 for the @entity246			2
they married in july 2011 in a ceremony staged in @entity249 and attended by the queen and senior royals			0
@entity4 won a silver medal at @entity253 with eventing equestrian teammates @entity255 , @entity256 , @entity257 and @entity258 , and is planning to take part in the @entity260 in 2016 .			0
