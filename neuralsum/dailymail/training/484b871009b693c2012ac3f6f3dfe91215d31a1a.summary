at first glance , it looks uncannily like an image of the human brain			2
but in fact , this is the death of one of the first stars in our @entity8			1
researchers say the death throes of these early stars were unique as they exploded as supernovae and burned completely , leaving no black hole behind , but instead spewing out chemical elements into space that eventually formed our @entity8			1
this image is a slice through the interior of a supermassive star of 55,500 solar masses			2
it shows the inner helium core in which nuclear burning is converting helium to oxygen , powering various fluid instabilities , which form the swirling lines			2
this ' snapshot ' from a simulation shows one moment a day after the onset of the explosion , when the radius of the outer circle would be slightly larger than that of the orbit of the @entity39 around the sun. to model the life of a primordial supermassive star , @entity41 and his colleagues used a one - dimensional stellar evolution code called @entity46			1
this code takes into account key processes like nuclear burning and stellar convection			0
they found that primordial stars between 55,000 to 56,000 solar masses live about 1.69 million years before becoming unstable due to general relativistic effects and then start to collapse			1
the images look similar to scans of a human brain as the star collapses , it begins to rapidly synthesize heavy elements like oxygen , neon , magnesium and silicon starting with helium in its core			1
this process releases more energy than the binding energy of the star , halting the collapse and causing a massive explosion : a supernova			0
to model the death mechanisms of these stars , @entity41 and his colleagues used @entity76 — a multidimensional compressible astrophysics code developed at @entity78 by scientists @entity79 and @entity81			1
certain primordial stars — those between 55,000 and 56,000 times the mass of our @entity86 , or solar masses — may have died unusually , the team concluded			1
astrophysicists at the @entity90 , @entity90 ( @entity90 ) and the @entity91 came to this conclusion after running a number of supercomputer simulations at the @entity95 's ( @entity95 's ) @entity96 ( @entity96 ) and @entity97 at the @entity91			0
they relied extensively on @entity76 , a compressible astrophysics code developed at @entity95 's @entity78 's ( @entity78 's ) @entity99 ( @entity99 )			0
their findings were recently published in @entity101 ( @entity101 )			0
first - generation stars are especially interesting because they produced the first heavy elements , or chemical elements other than hydrogen and helium			1
in death , they sent their chemical creations into outer space , paving the way for subsequent generations of stars , solar systems and galaxies			1
with a greater understanding of how these first stars died , scientists hope to glean some insights about how the @entity8 , as we know it today , came to be			1
' we found that there is a narrow window where supermassive stars could explode completely instead of becoming a supermassive black hole — no one has ever found this mechanism before , ' says @entity41 , a postdoctoral researcher at @entity90 and lead author of the @entity101 paper			1
' without @entity96 resources , it would have taken us a lot longer to reach this result			0
' from a user perspective , the facility is run very efficiently and it is an extremely convenient place to do science			0
' to model the life of a primordial supermassive star , @entity41 and his colleagues used a one - dimensional stellar evolution code called @entity46			1
this code takes into account key processes like nuclear burning and stellar convection			0
and relevant for massive stars , photo - disintegration of elements , electron - positron pair productionand special relativistic effects			1
the team also included general relativistic effects , which are important for stars above 1,000 solar masses			1
they found that primordial stars between 55,000 to 56,000 solar masses live about 1.69 million years before becoming unstable due to general relativistic effects and then start to collapse			1

to model the death mechanisms of these stars , @entity41 and his colleagues used @entity76 — a multidimensional compressible astrophysics code developed at @entity78 by scientists @entity79 and @entity81			2
these simulations show that once collapse is reversed , @entity180 instabilities mix heavy elements produced in the star 's final moments throughout the star itself			2
to model the life of a primordial supermassive star , @entity41 and his colleagues used a one - dimensional stellar evolution code called @entity46			2
this code takes into account key processes like nuclear burning and stellar convection			0
these images show the simulation in action , tracking the spread of chemical compounds			2
the researchers say that this mixing should create a distinct observational signature that could be detected by upcoming near - infrared experiments such as the @entity204 's @entity203 and @entity206 's @entity205			0
depending on the intensity of the supernovae , some supermassive stars could , when they explode , enrich their entire host galaxy and even some nearby galaxies with elements ranging from carbon to silicon			1
in some cases , supernova may even trigger a burst of star formation in its host galaxy , which would make it visually distinct from other young galaxies			0
' my work involves studying the supernovae of very massive stars with new physical processes beyond hydrodynamics , so i 've collaborated with @entity79 to adapt castro for many different projects over the years , ' says @entity41			1
' before i run my simulations , i typically think about the physics i need to solve a particular problem			0
i then work with @entity79 to develop some code and incorporate it into @entity76			0
it is a very efficient system			0
' to visualize his data , @entity41 used an open source tool called @entity236 , which was architected by @entity237 , formerly a staff scientist at @entity78 ' most of the time i did my own visualizations , but when there were things that i needed to modify or customize i would shoot @entity237 an email and that was very helpful			0
' @entity41 completed much of this work while he was a graduate student at the @entity91			0
he completed his ph.d. in physics in 2013 .			0

primordial stars between 55,000 and 56,000 times the mass of our @entity86 died unusually
exploded as supernovae and burned completely , leaving no remnant black hole behind
stars spewed out chemical elements into space that eventually formed our universe
