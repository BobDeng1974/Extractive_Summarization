by @entity0 today we ’re spoiled by the abundance of advanced cameras available , whether it ’s just a smartphone ’s lens or a professional slr			0
but these pictures of @entity8 taken with a @entity9 by photographer @entity10 are oddly alluring , despite paling in comparison to modern technology			1
taken in 2000 , the photos reveal various locations around @entity8 in ‘ stunning low definition ’			1
photographer @entity10 has revealed his amazing photos of @entity8 life taken back in 2000 using a @entity9 , a primitive accessory for @entity19 's @entity18 that once held the @entity20 for the world 's smallest camera			1
here we see a park bench as a street stretches into the distance @entity19 ’s @entity18 , released in 1989 , pioneered the age of modern portable gaming – together with its successor the @entity31 , it sold 118.69 million units worldwide			0
a little - known accessory released in 1998 , though , was the @entity9			0
this tiny device , capable of taking black and white photos at a resolution of 256x224 , attached into the @entity18 and in 1999 held the @entity20 for the world ’s smallest digital camera			1
by modern standards the camera is incredibly primitive , but in 2000 it was a novelty to have such a small device capable of taking photos			2
and so , as @entity10 explains on his website , he took to the streets of @entity8 to give it a shot			2
originally he had planned to work on a project adding colour to @entity18 photos , but first he decided to give the accessory a whirl on the streets			0
here 's two differing views of the @entity56 statue and fountain at the @entity59 main entrance in @entity8			2
one is taken through the eyes of @entity10 's @entity9 in 2000 , while the other is a photo taken on 15 june 2012 with a somewhat more advanced device			1
we 'll let you decide which is which look appealing ? here @entity10 snaps a classic shot of a slice of @entity8 pizza surely anticipating the rise of the selfie , @entity10 is seen here snapping a picture of himself with the camera ‘ when i first got the camera , i took a walk through midtown taking pictures , ’ he writes			1
he had forgotten about the photos until recently when he decided to share them			0
‘ i was doing some general lightroom file maintenance and was looking at some of my oldest digital images , and there they were , " he told @entity80			0
‘ these are n't actually my oldest digital photos , but they 're close			0
’ @entity19 's @entity18 ( left ) was released in 1989 and went on to become a worldwide phenomenon in portable gaming , spawning many successors and imitators			0
the @entity9 ( right ) , meanwhile , was a little - known accessory launched in 1998 that was once the world 's smallest digital camera guessing game : on one side , the @entity96 as seen in the year 2000 through the eyes of a @entity18			1
on the other , a more recent colour picture taken with a modern digital camera here is seen a @entity103 statue , one made by @entity105 sculptor @entity103 , at the @entity106 to make them easier to see , they are scaled up by 200 % , as originally they were intended only to be viewed on the much smaller @entity18 screen			2
the photos highlight some iconic locations in @entity8 , and also provide some glimpses of life in the city			1
in one photo we see the entrance to the @entity59 in all its grainy glory ; in another just a simple slice of pizza is given the @entity18 treatment			0
and @entity10 even anticipate the rise of the selfie by snapping a picture of himself , all those 14 years ago			0
two people on the @entity8 subway are seen through the eyes of the tiny lens on the @entity9 here no , these are n't real taxis - here @entity10 spied a number of toy taxis on the streets of @entity8 and decided to snap a picture now you see it : here a subway speeds past as @entity10 grabs a quick snap with the @entity9			1
