he said : ' i have had him for almost 10 years - he 's like part of the family			0
' my girlfriend @entity35 is the only girlfriend i have ever had that also likes frogs , so we are a perfect partnership			0
' but i admit things got a bit strained when i asked her to look after him , and he was sitting on the table while she was playing with her engagement ring			2
' she dropped it and it fell towards the table where my frog was sitting , and as quick as a flash it snapped the ring out of the air and swallowed it			2
' the couple tried to retrieve the ring , but before they had the chance the frog had already swallowed it			0
veterinarian @entity57 at first thought the couple were playing a practical joke , but x-rays revealed the frog had indeed swallowed the ring ms @entity57 said the ring was too big for the frog to pass and so she was forced to carry out a ' difficult operation ' they then took it to the vets near their home in the city of @entity69			2
veterinarian @entity57 , 38 , said : ' i must admit i was sceptical about whether or not it was some sort of a practical joke but when i x-rayed it , sure enough there was the engagement ring complete with stone in the frog 's stomach			1
' it was clear that it was too big to ever pass out in the natural way , and as they did n't want to kill the frog i had to use a special hook to pull the ring out which was a difficult operation			0
' although it did not involve any surgery the frog has had to go on a diet now for three days to make sure there is no lasting damage from the tricky procedure			0
' after being washed the ring was returned to @entity35 , 26 , who said they are now continuing with their plans for the wedding , which is due to take place at the start of august .			0
