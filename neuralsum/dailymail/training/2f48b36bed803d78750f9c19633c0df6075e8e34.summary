@entity10 said : ' the bears used to go in and out of the little pools in their enclosure , and at about three months they climbed the ladder of the big pool and basically hopped right in			1
' they love being in and playing around in the water			0
' honey , my @entity14 black bear , likes the water too but she does n't take to it quite like @entity33			1
' hopped in : @entity10 said the bears used to ' go in and out of the little pools in their enclosure , and at about three months they climbed the ladder of the big pool and basically hopped right in ' care : @entity10 keeps all his animals in his home when they are younger - @entity33 and @entity60 moved to an enclosure when they were four months old quick learner : @entity10 brought the bears to @entity29 when they were eight weeks old @entity10 says : ' when the animals are young they stay in the house with me - it 's important because that 's how they socialize and bond with me ' ' @entity83 personality ' : @entity10 says he loves playing with them every day , adding that they have ' big personalities ' @entity10 keeps all his animals in his home when they are younger - @entity87 moved to an enclosure when they were four months old			1
