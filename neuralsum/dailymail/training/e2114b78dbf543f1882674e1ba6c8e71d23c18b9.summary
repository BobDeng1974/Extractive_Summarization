by @entity1 reporter published : 00:53 est , 17 june 2013 updated : 00:56 est , 17 june 2013 purses , handbags , pocketbooks : no matter what you call them , you can forget about carrying them with you to your next pro-football game			2
the @entity11 is tightening stadium security starting this preseason , limiting the size and type of bags fans can bring to the game			1
and since the rule includes standard sized purses , lady fans will soon be crying foul			2
only ' hand - sized ' clutches and clear totes are now allowed with the exception of medically necessary items , only clear plastic , vinyl or pvc bags no larger than 12 inches by 6 inches by 12 inches will be allowed			1
one - gallon clear plastic freezer bags also will be ok , as will small clear plastic bags approximately the size of someone 's hand , with or without a handle or strap			1
one of those clear bags and a small clutch bag will be allowed per person			1
the @entity11 says the restrictions are designed to enhance security while speeding up entry into stadiums , but women say feel they ’re being targeted			1
and some say they may even just skip the upcoming season because of the new rule			2
‘ i do n't like this at all , ’ @entity52 fan @entity51 told @entity54			0
‘ i do n't want everyone to see what 's in my purse			2
they 're still going to have to search the plastic bag			0
it 's just going to make everyone more upset			0
’ unfortunately your browser does not support @entity64			0
banned items will include purses larger than a clutch bag ; coolers ; briefcases ; backpacks ; fanny packs ; cinch bags ; seat cushions ; luggage ; computer bags ; and camera bags or any bag larger than the permissible size			1
female football fan site @entity79 is also unhappy with the rule			0
they write : ' what the league considers an improvement to public safety , i consider a setback for all fans , particularly women			0
women carry purses ... mostly because of the functionality			0
by asking women to leave their purses at home ... the league is disconnecting from a fan base they are supposedly working so hard to expand			0
' awfully specific : no purses are allowed , but clear plastic totes , which the @entity11 conveniently licenses , are allowed under strict parameters			1
non-licensed totes are also allowed so long as they fit the parameters instead of a purse , the @entity11 is recommending fans take with them clear totes			1
conveniently , a line of such totes are licensed to carry the logo of every @entity11 team			1
an @entity11 committee on stadium security recommended these measures in may and the owners have approved them			1
the @entity11 ramped up security at the draft in late april , its one major event since the @entity117 bombings			1
recently , the @entity11 has done pat downs and bag checks and also used metal detectors to upgrade security			2
the new policy announced thursday has worked well at colleges such as @entity124 , @entity125 and @entity126 , which do not permit any bags in their stadiums			2
@entity130 's @entity129 allows only clutch bags			2
pack light : large purse loving women will now have to switch to clutches that fit within very specific parameters if they want to see a live pro football game ‘ our fans deserve to be in a safe and secure environment , ’ @entity138 , the @entity11 's chief security officer , said			1
‘ public safety is our top priority			0
this will make the job of checking items much more efficient and effective			0
we will be able to deliver a better and quicker experience at the gates and also provide a safer environment			0
we appreciate our fans ' cooperation			0
’ binoculars , cameras , and smartphones also will be permitted			0
the league is encouraging fans not to bring any bags to games			1
a secondary buffer area well outside the stadium will be established where security personnel will check for prohibited items or bags being carried toward the ballpark			0
fans with prohibited bags will be turned away until they dispose of those bags			0
stadium personnel are being encouraged to have approved bags on hand to give to fans , or to have a place outside the restricted areas to check items , so that fans can reclaim after games .			1

starting this season , only purses the size of a person 's hand will be allowed into pro games
the @entity11 urges *people* to bring no bags at all , but also offers team logo *emblazoned* clear bags that are allowed into stadiums
