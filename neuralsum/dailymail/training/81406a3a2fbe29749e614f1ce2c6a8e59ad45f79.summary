by @entity0 published : 08:32 est , 20 february 2013 updated : 10:08 est , 20 february 2013 @entity1 made up two witnesses to bolster his compensation case against @entity4 an ex-soldier has been jailed after he falsely claimed £ 40,000 compensation for falling down steps			1
former royal engineer @entity1 , 30 , made the claim three years after his accident - and pretended the delay was because he was serving with @entity11 in @entity12			1
but a court heard how @entity1 was caught out - because he was actually serving a prison sentence for manslaughter			1
the hearing was told how @entity1 fell down a set of stairs while on a jog in 2006 and suffered a ' bucket handle tear ' in the medial meniscus fibrocartilage in his knee			2
he filed a claim against @entity4 alleging his knee injury was as a result of their neglect			1
prosecutor @entity28 said : ' @entity1 fabricated two witnesses to the accident			1
' he claimed one witness assisted him and the other gave him a lift home			0
' but when asked about these claims one witness said he knew nothing of the accident while the other gave a surprisingly vague and differing account			0
' @entity38 heard how @entity1 served in the armed forces from the ages of 16 to 21 and achieved the rank of lance corporal			1
he had served in @entity43 and @entity44 - but left because of stress and started work as a plumber			2
@entity1 lodged the compensation claim three years after the alleged slip on the steps			1
he claimed he was on a tour of duty in @entity12			2
but it was later revealed he was in @entity53 for manslaughter after he killed former miner @entity55 , 45 , by punching him twice in the face in a fight outside a pub in @entity59 , @entity60 in may 2008			2
ex-soldier @entity1 , 30 , tried to sue @entity4 for £ 40,000 for an injury from falling down steps @entity55 , 45 , who died after being punched by @entity1 in may 2008 father - of - three mr @entity55 , from @entity59 , did not regain consciousness after the attack and died of a brain haemorrhage			1
the case was finally ready to go to trial in october last year but on the first day of the case he withdrew his claim - incurring legal costs of £ 61,000			1
and the council then launched their own private prosecution against @entity1 after realising he had tried to scam them			2
@entity74 , defending , said : ' in cases of this kind , it often happens that claims are simply made up			0
' that is not so on this occasion			0
this was a genuine claim that was falsely boosted , he stupidly , foolishly gilded the lily			0
' this is not a man with a history of deception and dishonesty and he apologies for misleading the court			0
' father - of - one @entity1 , of @entity92 , near @entity93 , @entity60 , admitted contempt of court at the @entity95			1
he was sentenced to another four weeks behind bars yesterday after investigators found his case was fraudulent			0
district judge @entity99 told him : ' parts of your claim were fraudulent , parts of your evidence were dishonest			0
' you made up two witnesses to bolster your case , making up falsehoods of this kind must be dealt with extremely seriously			2
' you have acknowledged that you have lost a considerable amount through the false aspects of what you say was a genuine claim for damages			0
' you have a very large bill of costs that you must pay at of risk bankruptcy			0
' putting forward false evidence is a very serious contempt of court and in other cases of this kind invariably results in a prison sentence			0
@entity1 claimed he was serving alongside troops in @entity12			1
but the former lance corporal was serving three years in @entity53 for killing former miner @entity55 ( file photo ) ' there is no reason to depart from that on this occasion			1
' @entity129 , deputy leader of @entity131 council , said : " mr @entity1 ' claim raised many questions , which required further detailed investigation of the claim			2
' our fraud investigation team screens every insurance claim and uses fraud indicators to look for questionable claims			0
' every penny paid out to fraudsters is a penny less to spend on vital local services for the people of @entity131			0

@entity1 tried to make @entity4 pay out for his fall down steps
he said the three - year delay in claim was because he was in @entity12
but the former lance corporal was behind bars for manslaughter
@entity1 , 30 , made up two witnesses and only withdrew claim on trial *'s* first day
