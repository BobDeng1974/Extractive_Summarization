' in something of a split within the agency , @entity0 said that he was not sure he would have approved the use of waterboarding if he had authority over its use shortly after the 9/11 attacks			1
@entity0 said use of the controversial tactic would have been a tough call			2
' i do n't know … it depends on the totality of circumstances at the time , ' he stated			0
' there are certain things that are clearly permissible and then there are a bunch of things in the middle , and i would admit that waterboarding is near the edge of that window , ' he said			0
