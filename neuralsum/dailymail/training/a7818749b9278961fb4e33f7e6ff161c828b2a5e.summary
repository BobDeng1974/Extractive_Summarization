i ca n’t exclude it			2
it could be suffocation or it could be a naturally occurring collapse with an unknown cause , which then goes onto cause these symptoms			2

@entity119 was in another room			1
’ ' it was a very sad and tragic death ' @entity180 , @entity181 @entity10 coroner @entity180 asked her : ‘ it is possible that @entity184 may have tried perhaps to change @entity33 ? that would be an explanation would n’t it ? ' mrs @entity27 replied : ‘ yes			1
’ she said nappy bags would normally be kept on a window sill			1
@entity37 died at 1.18pm on may 25 , 2013			0
coroner mr @entity180 said : ‘ all i can say is repeat what dr @entity51 said			1
the suffocation on nappy bags is possible and ca n’t be fully excluded , but there is no direct evidence at the post-mortem of it			2
‘ the best thing for me to do is return what is called an open verdict where the evidence at the inquest does n’t fully show what the cause of death is			0
‘ i think the most likely aspect of this was that it was a natural cause , but it is hard to determine what that natural cause was			0
it was a very sad and tragic death			0
