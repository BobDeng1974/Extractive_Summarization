with the @entity2 season entering its final stretch , focus is now turning to the summer transfer window			0
many clubs will be looking to snap up a bargain free transfer and there are plenty to choose from			0
here are best players who are currently set to leave their @entity2 clubs on a free in june			0
@entity12 's tenacious , creative and versatile midfielder @entity11 could leave as a free agent goalkeeper - @entity14 ( @entity15 ) at 36 years old , he is no spring chicken , but @entity14 could prove a useful acquisition for a newly - promoted side			1
@entity14 has played second fiddle to @entity20 and then @entity21 during his four years at @entity15 , but has performed well when called upon in the cup competitions and was in goal when the @entity24 beat @entity25 in the @entity26 final two years ago			1
@entity15 's @entity14 , 36 , is the understudy for @entity21 but has done well in the cups right - back - @entity28 ( @entity29 ) @entity31 's first - choice right - back at the @entity32 is still a regular for @entity29 , but he looks almost certain to end his six - year spell at @entity35 this summer			1
@entity28 , who has 54 @entity31 caps , is on a bumper deal at the @entity39 club and there seems to be little appetite to keep him on the books			2
@entity31 's first - choice right - back at the @entity32 looks set to leave @entity29 after six years this summer centre - back - @entity44 ( @entity29 ) another regular at @entity29 who is still to extend his contract			1
@entity44 kept @entity47 quiet with an excellent display when @entity49 came to @entity35 in november , but the 34 - year - old @entity50 lacks consistency and has made some terrible gaffes in his time at the club			2
inconsistency has been @entity44 's curse - the 34 - year - old @entity50 has produced some howlers at @entity29 centre - back - @entity59 ( @entity60 ) @entity59 performed so well at the @entity32 that his omission from the team of the tournament raised a few eyebrows , especially when @entity65 was selected ahead of him			1
injury has restricted the @entity67 to 16 appearances for @entity60 this season			0
at 30 , he has at least a couple of years left in him yet and will surely be courted by other top - flight teams			0
@entity72 's @entity59 was a surprise omission from the team of the @entity32 but could leave @entity60 left - back - @entity75 ( @entity76 ) @entity76 have been doing everything they can to tie this promising young defender down to a new deal , but he is yet to put pen to paper			1
the 21 - year - old has played nine times for @entity76 this year and faces a big battle to displace @entity85 so he may fancy a challenge elsewhere			0
@entity76 want to lock the talented 21 - year - old @entity75 down for the long term but he 's yet to commit right wing - @entity11 ( @entity12 ) probably the most high - profile free agent available this summer , @entity11 has 15 years ' worth of top - flight experience to his name and 53 @entity31 caps			1
@entity11 is both tenacious and creative , either in the centre of midfield or out wide , and he is still a year off his 30th birthday			2
@entity11 has 15 years in top flight experience , 53 @entity31 caps and still is n't 30 , so a great buy for someone @entity99 ( @entity100 ) named @entity100 captain last summer , but @entity99 has not played for the @entity102 since november due to injury			1
hard to see him displacing the in - form @entity104 on his return			0
may be 33 , but still has a good eye for a pass and is also a free - kick specialist			0
@entity99 has n't played for @entity100 since november due to injury and will need to displace @entity104 @entity112 midfield - @entity111 ( @entity113 ) named captain for a tour match against @entity116 last summer , @entity111 clearly thought he had a future under new @entity113 manager @entity118			1
' i think i 'm going to be his type of player , ' he said			0
but alas , that did not prove to be the case			0
the 25 - year - old was farmed out on loan to @entity60 , where he has played 30 times			0
he is not wanted back at @entity113			2
@entity60 and @entity76 are keen to sign the @entity31 international			0
unwanted by @entity113 , @entity60 and @entity76 want to sign @entity31 international @entity111 left wing - @entity130 ( @entity131 ) bravely battled back from testicular cancer to return to the @entity131 squad last month , but is no longer wanted by his club			1
will be 32 in the summer , but still a good operator and would prove an inspirational figure to younger players around him			0
testicular cancer survivor @entity130 will be an important figure somewhere , even if it is n't @entity131 striker - @entity141 ( @entity142 ) one of a number of young @entity145 strikers pushing for national selection after scoring nine goals for @entity142 this season			1
rumoured to be of interest to @entity113 and their neighbours @entity12 , as well as @entity151 ' @entity150			2
@entity113 and @entity12 are said to be interested in @entity142 's dangerous striker @entity141 striker - @entity154 ( @entity113 ) promoted to the first - team squad last summer following a fairytale debut under @entity157 against @entity158			1
the 19 - year - old has played 16 times under @entity161 , but has struggled to get on the bench recently and despite rumours of a new deal being close , the @entity113 academy product is yet to agree terms			2
@entity154 , 19 , has played 16 times under @entity118 but is now struggling to get on the bench			2
