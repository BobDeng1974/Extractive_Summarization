@entity0 was yesterday accused of suppressing a critical report that found hundreds of foreign criminals are escaping deportation			1
@entity4 , the independent chief inspector of borders and immigration , gave the report to the home secretary in the summer but it has only just been published			1
mr @entity4 , who has exposed glaring gaps in the @entity10 ’s border controls , said he could ‘ see no reason ’ why she had not published it earlier			1
’ the latest report looked at a major new scheme known as @entity25 , which involves immigration officials working in police stations to run checks on suspects ’ immigration status and criminal history			2
it concluded that despite significant improvements in some areas , many foreign offenders were still being released by police without checking they were allowed to be in the country			1
the scheme has had a ‘ positive impact ’ after it was introduced in @entity39 in october 2012 , the report said			2
the number of immigration offenders deported from the capital has risen by 158 per cent from 418 in 2011 - 12 to 1,077 in 2013 - 14			0
but 336 of 717 foreign nationals detained by @entity45 – the other force in the scheme ’s trial – were released before their immigration status was checked			0
the force also only saw a small rise in the number of foreign criminals that were removed – from 239 in 2012 - 13 to 274 last year			0
mr @entity4 said he completed one report in the summer but it had only been published now			1
it concluded that many foreign offenders were being released without police checking if they were allowed in the @entity10 ( file pic ) and some suspects held by the @entity60 were freed because staff shortages meant there were no immigration officers available to run the checks			1
last week , it emerged that a @entity67 gang who attacked university professor @entity69 , 55 , and his wife in their home in @entity72 , south - west @entity39 , had convictions in their homeland for violent robbery			0
other shortcomings revealed in the report included missed targets for foreigners leaving under ‘ conditional cautions ’ , which are given for petty crimes and usually allow the suspect up to 16 weeks to leave @entity10 voluntarily rather than be prosecuted			2
@entity84 immigration minister @entity83 said : ‘ @entity0 ’s reputation for competence will suffer if she ca n’t ensure schemes like this that can deliver results are put into action properly			0
’ mr @entity4 has been embroiled in an ongoing feud with the @entity92 over the publication of reports , and last week sent a letter to the @entity96 , which is investigating the immigration system , to condemn the delays			0
he also announced in the summer that he was resigning in ‘ frustration ’ at attempts by mrs may to ‘ manipulate ’ his work .			0

@entity16 inspector @entity4 says he gave critical report to may in summer
but it has only been published now and he has accused her of a cover up
says the only reason for delay is to lessen the impact of his investigation
he found police were not checking if foreign offenders were allowed in @entity10
