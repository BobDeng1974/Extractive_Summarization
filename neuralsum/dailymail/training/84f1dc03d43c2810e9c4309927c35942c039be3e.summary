the @entity2 spacecraft is still riding a massive ' tsunami wave ' that first began in february , @entity0 has revealed			1
it is the longest - lasting shock wave that researchers have seen in interstellar space			1
experts say the find is making them rethink how the ' end of space ' works			2
the @entity2 spacecraft has been riding the same ' tsunami wave ' since february , baffling researchers it is 37 years since the twin @entity2 and 2 spacecraft were launched and the pair continue to explore where nothing from @entity17 has flown before			1
their primary mission was the exploration of @entity21 and @entity22			0
after making a string of discoveries there -- such as active volcanoes on @entity27 and intricacies of @entity22 's rings -- the mission was extended			0
@entity31 went on to explore @entity32 and @entity33 , and is still the only spacecraft to have visited those outer planets			2
the current mission for both spacecraft , the @entity36 , is to explore the outermost edge of the @entity41 's domain and beyond			2
the ' tsunami wave ' is still propagating outward , according to the new results			1
it is the longest - lasting shock wave that researchers have seen in interstellar space			1
' most people would have thought the interstellar medium would have been smooth and quiet			2
but these shock waves seem to be more common than we thought , ' said @entity51 , professor of physics at the @entity53			0
he presented the new data at the @entity56 meeting in @entity57			0
a ' tsunami wave ' occurs when the sun emits a coronal mass ejection , throwing out a magnetic cloud of plasma from its surface			1
this generates a wave of pressure			2
when the wave runs into the interstellar plasma - the charged particles found in the space between the stars - a shock wave results that perturbs the plasma and causes in to ' sing '			1
' the tsunami causes the ionized gas that is out there to resonate -- ' sing ' or vibrate like a bell , ' said @entity78 , project scientist for the @entity2 mission based at @entity80 in @entity81			1
this is the third shock wave that @entity2 has experienced			1
the first event was in october to november of 2012 , and the second wave in april to may of 2013 revealed an even higher plasma density			2
@entity2 detected the most recent event in february , and it is still going on as of november data			1
the spacecraft has moved outward 250 million miles ( 400 million kilometers ) during the third event			2
' this remarkable event raises questions that will stimulate new studies of the nature of shocks in the interstellar medium , ' said @entity97 , astrophysicist emeritus at @entity98 in @entity99 , @entity100 , who analyzed the magnetic field data that were key to these results			0

it is unclear to researchers what the unusual longevity of this particular wave may mean			2
they are also uncertain as to how fast the wave is moving or how broad a region it covers			0
the second tsunami wave helped researchers determine in 2013 that @entity2 had left the heliosphere , the bubble created by the solar wind encompassing the sun and the planets in our solar system			1
denser plasma ' rings ' at a higher frequency , and the medium that @entity141 flew through , was 40 times denser than what had been previously measured			0
this was key to the conclusion that @entity2 had entered a frontier where no spacecraft had gone before : interstellar space			1
' the density of the plasma is higher the farther voyager goes , ' @entity78 said			0
' is that because the interstellar medium is denser as @entity2 moves away from the heliosphere , or is it from the shock wave itself ? we do n't know yet			1
' the heliosphere , in which the @entity41 and planets reside , is a large bubble inflated from the inside by the high - speed solar wind blowing out from the @entity41 pressure from the solar wind , along with pressure from the surrounding interstellar medium , determines the size and shape of the heliosphere			0

the supersonic flow of solar wind abruptly slows at the termination shock , the innermost boundary of the solar system			0
the edge of the solar system is the heliopause			0
the bow shock pushes ahead through the interstellar medium as the heliosphere plows through the galaxy			0

the edge of the solar system is the heliopause			0
the bow shock pushes ahead through the interstellar medium as the heliosphere plows through the galaxy			0
@entity51 , principal investigator of the plasma wave instrument on @entity2 , expects that such shock waves propagate far out into space , perhaps even to twice the distance between the sun and where the spacecraft is right now			1
@entity2 and its twin , @entity31 , were launched 16 days apart in 1977			2
both spacecraft flew by @entity21 and @entity22			0
@entity31 also flew by @entity32 and @entity33			0
@entity31 , launched before @entity2 , is the longest continuously operated spacecraft and is expected to enter interstellar space in a few years			1
@entity204 , a division of @entity80 , built the twin @entity2 spacecraft and operates them for the @entity207 within @entity98 's @entity208 in @entity209 .			1
