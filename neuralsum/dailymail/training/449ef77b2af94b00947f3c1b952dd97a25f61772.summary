@entity0 came early for a four - year - old boy obsessed by trucks , when @entity3 decided to reunite him with his favorite driver and give him a truck of his own			1
@entity6 of @entity7 , @entity8 , would always look forward to seeing his local @entity3 delivery man , @entity9 , who would make deliveries in his neighborhood			1
' when i first started off he would n’t even come out of the house , he would just look at the truck from inside the window … he loved trucks in general , but for some reason the @entity3 truck really captivated him			2
he ’s just intrigued by it , ’ said @entity9 , who @entity6 calls mr @entity19			0
@entity3 recently uploaded a feel - good video of @entity6 , dressed in his own @entity3 uniform taking delivery of his very own miniature @entity3 truck			1
the truck should go some way to making up for the fact that @entity9 was transferred to a different route and therefore no longer sees @entity6 as often			2
speaking to local tv station @entity44 , @entity9 said : ‘ he used to brighten my day			0
and it was right in the middle of my day where i kind of needed a little bit of a pick - up			0
’ for @entity9 though , who has worked at @entity3 for over 25 years , the new route helps as it involves more driving and less heavy - lifting			2
the two were reunited when @entity3 arranged for @entity6 to come to the depot and meet the whole fleet of drivers , who had heard all about the boy from @entity57			1
‘ it 's every dad 's dream to see your son be part of a team , and not just in football , but in life , ’ @entity6 ’s father @entity64 told @entity44			0
‘ for every one of them , they 're making 10,000 christmases happen or holidays happen for us , ’ said @entity6			0
for @entity6 the thrill was not just seeing lots of big brown trucks , but getting to catch up with mr @entity19 again , and deliver some happiness of his own to his neighbors			0
@entity6 makes the rounds in @entity7 in his very own miniature @entity3 truck @entity6 took pride in delivering cookies and treats to the drivers at the local depot			1
