nurses working for the @entity2 @entity1 have not received ‘ a single email about any process changes ’ in the wake of the @entity7 outbreak			1
this is just one of the shocking claims made by @entity2 nurse , @entity10 , who has launched an online petition demanding that the @entity13 provide @entity15 health - care workers with ‘ hazmat suits and decom protocol			1
’ ms @entity19 ’s message could not be clearer			0
she wrote , ‘ we are not ready for this disease			0
’ nurses working for the @entity2 @entity1 ( not pictured ) have not received ‘ a single email about any process changes ’ in the wake of the @entity7 outbreak in a fulsome statement posted today ( saturday ) she explained , ‘ i work for the @entity2 @entity1 and we have not received a single email about any process changes			1
’ the registered nurse continued : ‘ recently , @entity29 – the country ’s largest nursing organization – found that 76 percent of its members said their hospitals had n’t communicated any policy about admitting @entity7 patients			2
‘ without the proper plan and equipment in place to keep us safe , we have a major problem			0
’ the petition , posted on @entity40 had already garnered close to 12,000 signatures – just 3,000 short of its aim - within just hours of being posted			1
according to ms @entity19 , ‘ today many nurses do n’t have the most appropriate resources ( fluid - resistant gowns , goggles , gloves etc )			0
so i ’m asking the @entity13 : why is the team decontaminating the nurse ’s apartment in full hazmat gear when our health care workers caring for @entity7 patients are provided with less than adequate protection ? ’ the @entity13 has come under increasing fire for its failure to contain the virus brought into the country by @entity57 , 42 , last month			1
the @entity13 has come under increasing fire for its failure to contain the virus brought into the country by @entity57 , 42 , last month two of the nurses who treated mr @entity57 at @entity62 , @entity63 , are now fighting for their lives having been infected by @entity7 themselves			1
nurses @entity66 , 26 , and @entity67 , 29 , have now been moved to other facilities with isolation units capable of treating them			0
but concerns over just how sick nurse @entity71 was when was given the all - clear to travel from @entity63 to @entity74 and back on a bridal shopping trip continue to grow , along with grave concerns at the @entity13 ’s handling of the crisis			1
a third health - care worker who handled mr @entity57 ’s lab work has now shown @entity7 symptoms after being allowed to board the cruise ship currently returning to @entity63 after it was turned back from the ports of @entity85 and @entity86			2
now , in her statement accompanying her online petition nurse @entity19 has brought fresh concerns to light and cast further doubt on the @entity92 , @entity94 and @entity13 ’s assertions that they are equipped to handle this crisis and have acted with ‘ an abundance of caution ’ at every step			1
a third health - care worker who handled mr @entity57 ’s lab work has now shown @entity7 symptoms after being allowed to board the cruise ship currently returning to @entity63 after it was turned back from the ports of @entity85 and @entity86 ( not pictured ) @entity62 has vigorously defended itself			2
in a statement issued last week the hospital pointed to the @entity13 ’s constantly shifting guidelines as a cause of ‘ frustration ’ among healthcare workers struggling to abide by them			0
they added that many of the stories that have emerged – including claims that waste was left to pile ‘ ceiling - high ’ in mr. @entity57 ’s treatment room – were ‘ gross exaggerations ’ and claimed that the hospital ’s policy of ‘ non-retaliation ’ rendered such anonymous reports unnecessary and unhelpful			2
but ms @entity19 is far from alone in her assertion that health - care workers are not being afforded the protection they so desperately need if the virus is to be contained and stopped in its tracks			0
she said , ‘ nurses are absolutely loud on their point : they want change and they want it now			0
‘ it ’s time we stand up and demand that the @entity13 provide proper protective equipment to our healthcare workers caring for a patient with @entity7			0
