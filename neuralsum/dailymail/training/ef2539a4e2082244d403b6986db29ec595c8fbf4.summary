by @entity0 published : 18:56 est , 11 february 2013 updated : 02:33 est , 12 february 2013 soaring numbers of young children are being sent to hospital because gps are increasingly unavailable to deal with even common infections , a report claims			2
the rate of children requiring emergency admission rose by more than a quarter in the 12 years to 2010 , researchers say			1
the largest jump was among under - fives , including a 52 per cent increase in emergency admissions of babies since 2003			1
unavailable : @entity4 are accused of not being on hand to deal with cases of common infections - leading to more children heading to @entity20 for treatment			2
( @entity22 picture ) common infections – not life - threatening illnesses – were to blame for much of the rise , which suggests a ‘ systematic failure in the @entity30 ’ according to the study involving seven million admissions			0
it found a ‘ persistent ’ increase year - on - year of around 3 per cent among under - fives			0
the study says there is a ‘ reluctance ’ to treat children at surgeries , driven by changes to the gp contract in 2004 which led to 90 per cent of family doctors opting out of caring for patients during evenings and weekends			0
' systematic failures ' : a reluctance to treat children at surgeries is a cause for the rise in @entity20 admission rates			1
( file photo ) study leader @entity51 , a researcher in the department of primary care health services at @entity54 , said emergency admissions put children at risk of hospital - acquired infections , medical errors , drug reactions and emotional trauma			1
the study , published online in the @entity63 , looked at hospital admission rates among the under - 15s in @entity66 and national population estimates for the years 1999 to 2010 inclusive			1
the emergency admissions rate among children rose by 28 per cent from 63 per 1,000 of the population in 1999 to 81 per 1,000 in 2010			1
but the increase in admissions does not reflect an increase in the number of very sick children – on the contrary , the risk of serious illness is low and falling , the study says			2
the number of deaths of children aged one to 14 fell by 36 per cent during the study			0
mr @entity51 said parents and doctors were more likely to ‘ play safe ’ when a child is ill. targets for @entity20 might also have contributed to the rise , he suggested , with children being admitted for observation before the four - hour maximum wait was breached			0
he said that and ‘ the change to general practitioners ’ out - of - hours care may have played an important role ’			0
the @entity94 said a key factor for the increase ‘ is likely to be the more cautious approach being taken to the treatment of children ’ .			0

study finds 52 *%* increase in emergency admissions of babies since 2003
rate of children needing @entity20 admission up a quarter in the 12 years to 2010
