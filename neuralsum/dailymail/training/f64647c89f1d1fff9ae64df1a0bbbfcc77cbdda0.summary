by @entity0 published : 19:35 est , 20 june 2013 updated : 03:41 est , 21 june 2013 mrs @entity1 made her comments when she appeared before the @entity3 and @entity4 as a mother - of - five and wealthy entrepreneur , she knows only too well how much effort it takes to juggle demanding personal and professional roles			1
but @entity1 has launched a stinging attack on maternity laws – which she believes hinder rather than help women in the workplace			1
‘ there is a brown envelope flashing above every woman ’s head in terms of tribunal threat , ’ she declared			1
the ‘ tricky and suffocating ’ regulations could force firms to employ men rather than women , mrs @entity1 , 45 , told @entity24			1
the luxury handbag and accessories company which bears her name counts celebrities such as the @entity30 as fans			2
mrs @entity1 , whose warning of the ‘ brown envelope ’ refers to the money which can be made from employment tribunals , has also been made one of the government ’s trade ambassadors			1
the laws stop bosses from insisting a pregnant employee reveal her plans for maternity leave , such as if and when she will return to work			2
they can ask but she is not required to answer and her company must not do anything which could be seen as pressurising her			2
mrs @entity1 made her comments when she appeared before the @entity3 and @entity4			1
asked by @entity49 mp @entity48 why she could not have these types of conversation , she replied : ‘ i find myself treading on eggshells and becoming hugely legal			2
it just feels really wrong			2
maternity rules have changed dramatically in the last decade , allowing women to take up to a year ¿ s leave , with nine months paid , and request flexible working ‘ it would be great if you were able to have a sensible chat			2
i would prefer it to go a stage further			0
it would work much better for women if they were asked to commit to how long they will take off			0
’ even if a female employee planned to take only two months off , her firm has to hire a replacement for a year to cover the maternity leave			0
‘ you can not hire someone for two months and keep rehiring , ’ said mrs @entity1			1
of her mostly female team of 50 , a total of 13 had babies in 2011			0
but she added : ‘ i think it [ regulation ] could end up working against women , unfortunately			0
‘ as a woman , a mother - of - five and an employer of a lot of women with children , it would end up making you make a choice between employing a man or a woman			0
‘ you probably might pick the easier route because the regulation and consequential cost and eggshell treading would just be too onerous			0
’ she added : ‘ i can not say strongly enough that any more regulation will cripple this country			0
’ maternity rules have changed dramatically in the last decade , allowing women to take up to a year ’s leave , with nine months paid , and request flexible working			1
the committee ’s report into women in the workplace was published yesterday			1
it called on the government to highlight companies which encourage flexible working to ‘ dispel the myth ’ that this is ‘ problematic and can not work ’			1
large firms should also publish pay audits to highlight where large gender pay gaps exist , it added			0
a @entity116 spokesman said a new system of shared parental leave was replacing ‘ old - fashioned and rigid ’ rules			0
this allows working couples to choose how they share childcare in the first year after birth , he said .			0
