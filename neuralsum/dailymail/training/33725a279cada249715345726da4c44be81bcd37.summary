' the spokesman added : ' it is categorically untrue that anyone in @entity18 made the comments about the @entity24 and activists reported in the @entity26 and the @entity27			2
' reports claimed a senior ally of mr @entity6 made the comments accusing mps of being forced to take hardline views on issues such as @entity34 because of pressure from their local associations			1
the senior figure reportedly said : ' there 's really no problem			0
the mps just have to do it because the associations tell them to , and the associations are all mad swivel - eyed loons			1

' this is completely untrue			2
i would like to make it quite clear that i did not nor have ever described our associations in this way or in any similar manner			0

@entity8 mp @entity83 wrote on @entity56 : ' i wonder if this ' aide ' has ever been a member of an association , delivered a single leaflet , packed an envelope or knocked on a door ? ' my activists are far from being ' " swivel eyed loons "			1
