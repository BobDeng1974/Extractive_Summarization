@entity0 are planning to play in a series of money - spinning friendlies across the world should they fail to qualify for @entity4			1
the club is braced for a whopping £ 20million shortfall if they miss out on the @entity7 for the first time in 19 years			2
and if @entity10 - who has had a disastrous first season at the @entity12 helm - fails to steer the club into the @entity14 , the club are set to miss out on a further £ 5m			0
with the club set to rake in more than £ 12m from a five - game tour of the @entity41 in summer , there is money to be made in developing markets such as the @entity44 , @entity41 and @entity45			1
and with fellow giants @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 and @entity52 also struggling in their domestic leagues , @entity26 - who recently signed a £ 300,000 - a - week @entity46 could yet be set for regular trips abroad			0
in january 2008 , @entity0 banked £ 2m when playing in @entity55 for @entity57 's testimonial and they recently rejected the chance to play a lucrative friendly in @entity60 during their warm - weather break			1
future opponents ? @entity49 lie ninth in @entity63 and are 1 - 0 down to @entity64 in the last 16 of the @entity7 @entity65 days : @entity0 won the @entity7 six years ago but are facing missing out on the competition for the first time in 19 years the current @entity69 champions currently lie sixth - a daunting 11 points off fourth place with 11 games to play			2
@entity0 slumped to a miserable 2 - 0 defeat in the @entity7 last 16 by @entity16 - the lowest ranked side in the competition			0
yet despite the contingency plan , @entity10 has been told by @entity12 chiefs that qualification for the @entity14 is a priority to boost the club 's profile among its 650m global fanbase			1
money - spinning : @entity0 toured @entity81 in the pre-season - and they could return to @entity83 developing market : @entity85 applauds fans during a friendly at @entity88 last summer			0
