by @entity0 published : 03:16 est , 2 july 2012 updated : 12:16 est , 2 july 2012 it 's one of the golden rules of top tennis players - keep your balls in your pocket			2
unfortunately for @entity7 when his kept slipping out it became a problem that was always going to cause some chuckles			1
the host 's on @entity13 's today programme were quick to join in the giggles as they discussed the technical glitch plaguing the @entity17 in saturday 's late - night encounter with @entity19			0
' i 've seen it happen before bet i 've never seen it happen to @entity7 so it was very unfortunate , ' former @entity23 women 's number one @entity20 told @entity27 as they discussed the @entity29 's exclusive story that @entity7 was wearing new shorts after adidas investigated the matter			1
nice try , @entity7 , but they 've got to be white : @entity7 arrives for practice in blue shorts on sunday ( left ) , a day after the balls fell from his pocket ( right ) in his third round clash with @entity19 there is no specific rule about balls falling out of a pocket but it comes under the hindrance law			1
the law states that , if a player is hindered in playing a point by a deliberate act of an opponent , the player wins the point			0
if unintentional or outside of the player 's own control then the point is replayed			0
when the ball fell out of @entity7 's pocket a second and third time it was no longer deemed ' outside of his control ' and he lost the point			1
the pair then proceeded to discuss the tightness of mens ' tennis shorts in the past			2
' @entity67 had the obvious solution , ' mr @entity27 said			0
' he was saying ' back in my days it could n't have happened			0
our shorts were so tight nothing could have come out ''			2
' laughing loudly , ms @entity20 said : ' that is true , mens ' shorts in tennis have just changed shape do dramatically it 's hard to believe what they used to play in because they used to be very , very tight , very short shorts , and they look quite uncomfortable when you look back on them			2
' now of course the players are rolling round on the court in these very baggy shorts down to their knees so it 's a very different situation			1
' asked if she would be willing to be at the forefront of a campaign for player to bring back the tight old mens ' shorts of yesteryear , she said : ' definitely not			0
the shorts they were today look a lot more comfortable			0
' the @entity23 no 1 saw the objects pop out of his pockets three times during the encounter			0
he was twice punished with lost points			0
after taking up the problem with the @entity111 manufacturers adidas , @entity7 will now wear a redesigned pair of shorts when he steps on to court for his fourth - round match against @entity117 's @entity116 on monday			1
on saturday the ball popped out three times , each at a critical stage			0
the first time it happened umpire @entity123 ordered they replay the point , but on the latter two occasions the points went to @entity19			0
while the first slip was allowed to go unpunished , after the second and third blunders the star was penalised under rules governing hindrance during play			0
giggles : former @entity23 women 's no 1 @entity20 and @entity137 host @entity27 joked about @entity7 's shorts tight : @entity67 at @entity139 in 1981 wearing a pair of shorts that are much tighter than those worn by modern players @entity7 , sponsored by adidas since late 2009 in a £ 3m - a - year deal , has worn the brand 's @entity146 since the start of @entity139			1
@entity19 , @entity149 and @entity150 wear the machine - finished @entity152 shorts , which look almost identical but are longer			1
the @entity111 sportswear giant investigated the issue before issuing a statement , which read : ' @entity156 works closely with @entity7 on the design of all his kit and we believe the issues were the result of an individual technical error in the handmade pockets of those shorts			1
@entity7 will now wear the @entity152 short			1
' the sportswear manufacturer last night put the incidents down to human error , saying the pockets on the hand - finished shorts had been made too shallow			1
@entity7 's progress towards sunday 's final could be further disrupted by the weather and his scheduling on @entity174 1			2
the fourth seed is due second on the uncovered show court and heavy rain is forecast			0
if @entity7 's match against @entity116 can not be completed , the scot would be forced into playing on consecutive days			2
at least @entity7 's shorts should n't trouble him			1
after @entity7 's tennis ball mishap , i put a replica pair of @entity7 's shorts to the test … on @entity187 , i ran a series of 15 - metre sprints , side - stepped a bit and jumped up and down on the spot for 60 seconds but i was unable to dislodge a ball from the pockets on sunday			1
ball wiggler : @entity195 sports writer @entity0 tries out a pair of the naughty shorts it was only when i violently wiggled my legs that i could get the ball to nudge even slightly			0
@entity7 's thighs are at least double the size of mine but the key difference was the pockets on my shop - bought shorts ( for £ 30 ) were finished correctly			1
perhaps @entity7 should have nipped down the @entity207 .			2

penalised for blunder after spare *service* balls popped out onto court
@entity156 *launches* probe and @entity7 gets longer shorts with deeper pockets
