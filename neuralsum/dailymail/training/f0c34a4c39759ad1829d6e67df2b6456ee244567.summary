by @entity0 the @entity2 cream comes in at £ 150 a new anti-wrinkle cream is creating a big buzz in the world of cosmetics - because it 's made from bee venom			1
cosmetic maker @entity2 has just launched a new skincare line called @entity9 , which is clinically proved to halt the damaging effects of the menopause on the face			0
experts say that as well as mood swings , sleeplessness and weight - gain , women going through the menopause also suffer a variety of skin problems			2
deep wrinkles , puffiness and dryness are just some of the symptoms brought on by hormone changes at this time of life			0
during the menopause , levels of the female hormones oestrogen and progesterone drop rapidly leading to accelerated skin ageing			2
queen bee : the @entity33 are known fans of skincare infused with active bee venom levels of collagen and elastin also go down , leading to saggy skin and deep wrinkles and production of skin - hydrating acids and oils also significantly drop , causing dryness and a ' crepe ' appearance to the skin			1
studies show that more than half of @entity53 women are unaware of the impact the menopause has on their skin			2
bee - lieve it : @entity59 uses £ 25 venom cream in trials involving 14 women aged between 50 and 59 , all the volunteers said the bee venom cream improved the texture of their skin , reduced lines and wrinkles and left them appearing ' visibly more youthful '			1
honey bee venom is used cosmetically to ' fool ' the skin into thinking it has been lightly stung with the toxin melittin			1
this causes the body to direct blood towards the area and stimulates the production of the naturally - occurring chemicals collagen and elastin			1
collagen strengthens body tissue while elastin is the protein that helps the skin to remain taut and bounce back into shape after being pressed or pinched			1
the venom also has the effect of relaxing the muscles , it is claimed			2
experts collect bee venom by placing a pane of glass alongside a hive and running a weak electrical current through it , which encourages the insects to sting the surface			1
because the bee 's lance remains in its body , it does not die			0
tiny quantities of the venom are then collected			0
it is so valuable that it costs up to £ 30,000 for one ounce			0
@entity9 facial moisturiser costs £ 150 for a 50 - millilitre pot , while an eye cream version costs £ 115 for a 25 - millilitre tub			1
a spokesman for @entity2 said : ' @entity9 moisturiser is an advanced formula that revitalises and renews , giving naturally younger looking skin			0
' it works in synergy with a unique complex of plant stem cells to help visibly improve skin tone and elasticity			0
' fun facts : @entity123 source : @entity126 beauty , @entity127 is it down to the bees ? older beauties @entity131 and @entity132 look ever youthful ' other ingredients refine the skin 's surface to help plump and smooth the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles , and provide intensive moisturisation and long - lasting hydration for a radiant complexion			1
' both products are available at leading @entity144 shops as well as department store @entity145			0
bees are already responsible for other supposedly anti-ageing products from honey to royal jelly , a health supplement used by celebrities such as @entity153 , @entity154 and the @entity155			1
@entity156 n't afford the £ 150 pot ? @entity157 is on the @entity158 ... no harm : the honey bee 's lance remains in its body @entity163 and @entity164 brought us high - tech , bee venom skincare in october 2012 and made it affordable to everyone for the first time - and tv presenter @entity59 is a huge fan of their £ 24.99 @entity171			1
their @entity174 skincare uses the latest in bee venom technology			1
with over 10,000 bee stings per pot , surprisingly , this range of anti-aging wonders wo n't break the bank starting from £ 16.99 in comparison with the hundreds a botox jab will set you back			2
@entity185 , @entity186 , @entity187 , @entity188 , @entity189 , @entity190 , @entity191 and a whole host of other natural ingredients comprise this luxurious range			0
@entity196 skincare products range from skin serums to cleansers and masks			0
@entity200 , whose @entity201 is loved by @entity203 , @entity204 and @entity205 , have developed an eye - specific product to target lines and dark circles called @entity210			0
the £ 55 cream contains @entity185 , @entity9 , and their secret ingredient @entity213 to feed the tissue , firming & tightening the skin , for an instantly anti-ageing and rejuvenating effect			1
@entity213 works with the enzymes of fish			0
the river bed collects marine collagen over hundreds of years , from fish enzymes , which gather in the river silt and help the skin by boosting collagen			2
river silt is full of amino acids and bentonite which remove impurities and toxins from the skin			0
@entity163 and @entity232 doctor £ 24.99 @entity171 , and @entity233 , £ 55			0

@entity235 of @entity236 and @entity155 are already fans of bee venom
honey bee venom ( toxin melittin ) ' fools ' the skin , causing a rush of blood to the area and stimulating production of natural collagen and elastin
your *pocket* will feel the real sting as the cream comes in at a cool £ 150
no bees are hurt in the process of extracting venom
