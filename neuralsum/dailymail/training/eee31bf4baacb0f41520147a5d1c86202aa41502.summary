shameful : 80 - year - old korean war veteran @entity8 who 's reliant on a wheelchair was attacked and robbed in his own @entity7 home on saturday amnesia : @entity19 lost one of his legs in combat			1
he 'd been outside with his dog when his memory of last satruday 's events go blank at first , @entity19 feared he 'd had a stroke			1
' blood is everywhere and i really did n't know what the heck had happened to me			2
it took me most of the night to figure out what had happened , ' @entity8 told @entity34			1
he told @entity35 : ' when i woke up both my cat and my dog were right beside me here			0
and they never left me			0
' he also soon discovered nearly $ 400 missing from his home			2
@entity19 realized he 'd been attacked when he discovered on his head a gash about the size and shape of the butt of a gun			1
he 'd fallen out of his wheelchair and was bleeding so profusely from a wound on his toes that he nearly lost three on the remaining leg			2
but the war - hardened vet refused to seek medical attention , at least at first			0
eventually his friend @entity54 convinced him to get the police involved			0
'' i says , he 's going to be cranky because he did n't want me to call you			2
so if he gets cranky i am going to stand behind you ! '' she told the police			0
violent : @entity19 at first thought he 'd had a stroke when he awoke on the floor in a pool of blood -- that , perhaps , he 'd fallen out of his wheelchair because of the stroke and hurt himself -- but soon found a gun butt shaped wound on his head drug addicts ? police suspect @entity71 had gone back into the house and was facing his desk when an intruder bludgeoned him			1
four hundred was missing from the home and police think the robber or robbers make also have been after drugs even when the officer showed up , @entity8 said he did n't want medical attention			1
thankfully , he relented and was taken by ambulance to the hospital where he received stitches			0
@entity19 theorizes that , after he walked his dog , he went back into the house and a thief took the opportunity to take advantage of a disabled old man			2
he believes he was bludgeoned and that the intruder or intruders were interested not just in cash but also in stealing drugs			0
the proud retired arts professor told @entity34 that , while he 's terrified something like this could happen again , he 's not sure there 's anything that can be done about it			0
' where else would i go ? i â€™m lucky to have a place this size at the rate i pay , ' he said			0
this helplessness coming from an 80 - year - old who bravely served his country infuriates @entity19 's friends			1
and with so little evidence , police do n't have much hope they 'll nab the guilty party			0
' i was just so angry and so upset that some lowlife amoeba would come in and attack a vereran of our foreign wars , ' @entity54 told @entity34 .			0
