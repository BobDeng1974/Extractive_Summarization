by @entity0 follow @ @ martin_domin @entity1 knows victory over @entity3 on saturday will bring him closer to his ultimate dream – ending @entity6 ’s career			1
@entity1 faces the big - hitting @entity7 in his second fight at cruiserweight , with bitter rival @entity6 clashing with @entity11 on the same bill also in his second bout at 200lbs			1
should the two prevail , they are set for an explosive rematch later this year			1
whether it be this year , next year or whenever , i will retire him			1
‘ i need to focus on saturday ’s fight and not give him a second thought			2
in the back of my mind the carrot is being dangled in front of me and when this fight is over he will be on my mind , but for now it is all about @entity3 and getting the job done			1
‘ when his time comes he will understand and he will know what is coming			2
‘ when i get in the ring with him i am not losing two stone , i am not killing myself to do the weight , and he is going to know that			2
‘ it does n’t need a @entity46 title			2
the fight does absolutely nothing for my ranking because he is ranked below me			0
i will be fighting him purely for personal reasons , because i want to get rid of him			0
it is personal and that is the only reason i will fight him			0
‘ i am all about becoming world champion but i will be fighting him to purely please a personal satisfaction			0
i believe i won the first fight , but i did n’t officially get the decision			1
i am pretty confident i will get it next time – i wo n’t need decisions , referees or judges			0
i will just need a pair of gloves and him in a ring , and i will do the rest of the job			1
’ boy from @entity7 : @entity1 must first defeat @entity72 ( @entity19 ) in his second fight at cruiserweight @entity3 brings an ominous looking record of 23 @entity76 from 26 wins to @entity78 , and @entity1 insists the carrot of a clash with @entity6 has not distracted him from a tough second task at a weight he is still settling in to			1
‘ i am going in with a top class cruiserweight in @entity3 who gives out good tests , ’ he added			1
‘ i expect an extremely durable fighter , somebody who is maybe a bit stronger physically than me , but i am pretty confident he will get a shock when i hit him for the first time			0
‘ everyone goes the same way , they look at me across the ring and they think tall , skinny , he is n’t going to be able to punch much			0
i hit them for the first time and just look at their face when i nail them clean , they have been hit with something they have n’t been hit with before			0
it was the exact same with [ @entity105 ] @entity104			0
when i hit these guys , they think twice about coming in			0
fight night : @entity6 , with promoter @entity107 ( c ) , meets @entity11 on the same bill ‘ i have nothing but respect for @entity11 and i am sure he will go on to give people some tough tests but he came up against the new me – a huge - punching cruiserweight			1
‘ i did n’t have that kind of power at light heavyweight , and if i threw more than three or four power shots in a round at i would be tiring , so i had to limit myself to how many power shots i could throw and also to what i was taking back			0
‘ i could n’t take many risks at because my durability just was n’t there , i could n’t sustain any punishment and i was feeling every single punch			0
at cruiserweight i am quite happy giving and receiving punches , so there wo n’t be any problems there – i do n’t envisage myself being vulnerable at this weight			2
@entity1 vs @entity72 and @entity6 vs @entity11 are live on @entity133 on saturday			1
