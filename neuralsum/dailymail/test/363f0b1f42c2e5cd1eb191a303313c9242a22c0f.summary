under legal pressure , the @entity1 administration will begin telling some suspected terrorists if and why they are on a list of tens of thousands of people banned from flying to , from or within the @entity6			1
the new policy allows for an @entity6 traveler who has been denied boarding a commercial airliner to petition the @entity6 @entity10 once to find out whether he or she is on the no - fly list and a second time for an unclassified explanation of why he or she is on the list			1
in some cases , the government will not be able to provide an explanation because of national security concerns			1
the changes partially lift a veil of secrecy enshrouding a policy that has been a centerpiece of the government 's counterterrorism efforts since the september 2001 terror attacks			2
grounded or not grounded ? under legal pressure , the @entity1 administration will begin telling some suspected terrorists if and why they are on a list of tens of thousands of people banned from flying to , from or within the @entity6 above the security line at @entity35 @entity34 in october but the @entity36 , which has been challenging the constitutionality of the no - fly list in an ongoing federal lawsuit , said the changes do n't go far enough in giving travelers the legal due process they are entitled to , including seeing the evidence held against them and getting an opportunity to challenge it			1
the explanations provided to six travelers so far , which were mandated by a federal judge , have been inadequate , the @entity36 said			2
for instance , in a letter to @entity58 resident @entity56 , the government 's explanation for his inclusion on the list was based on information the @entity61 obtained from @entity62 when he was detained in @entity63 in 2007 , @entity36 attorney @entity49 said			2
the @entity36 considers @entity62 's detention to be unlawful and said he suffered abuse			0
' from the face of the letter , a neutral decision - maker would have no idea whatsoever that any of that occurred , ' said @entity70			0
the @entity71 declined to comment on the specific constitutionality challenges because of the ongoing lawsuit			0
@entity71 spokeswoman @entity74 said , ' we are committed to a process that protects @entity6 from terrorist threats while respecting privacy and safeguarding civil liberties			2
' last fall , there were about 64,000 people on the no - fly list , according to the government			1
typically , less than 5 per cent of those on the list are @entity6			1
the list fluctuates in size			0
previously , the government 's policy was never to confirm or deny that a person actually is on list , citing national security concerns			1
in most instances , travelers assume they are on the list because they are instructed to go through additional screening at airports or because they are told they ca n't board their flights			0
travelers have been able to appeal their presumed placement on the list since 2007			0
only a small percentage of appeals the government receives each year have been from travelers actually on the list , the government has said			0
the @entity10 gets between 15,000 and 20,000 requests a year , and less than 1 per cent of those are actually from people on the no - fly list , said @entity109 spokeswoman @entity108			1
in 2014 , a federal judge in @entity111 , @entity112 , required that the government notify 13 plaintiffs challenging the constitutionality of the no - fly list of their status on the list , and seven were told they were not on the list			1
the government provided explanations to the six plaintiffs it confirmed were on the no - fly list , including @entity62			1
one of the explanations included just a ' single cryptic sentence about alleged travel to a foreign country , ' according a court document filed earlier this year			0
the letters to the six plaintiffs on the no - fly list have been redacted on the public court docket to protect the plaintiffs ' reputations , @entity70 said			1
' the government had an opportunity to come up with a fair process but failed , so we 're challenging it in court again , ' @entity70 said			0
the @entity10 will continue to handle the petitions under the new policy			0
the changes are not yet in effect , and have so far only been applied to the 13 plaintiffs in the @entity111 lawsuit , but the @entity109 said it expects them be in place soon			0
@entity108 said individual requests should take months to process , not years			0
' these enhancements continue to ensure that individuals who are deemed to be a threat to our aviation security are prohibited from boarding a flight within , or bound for , the @entity6 , ' @entity108 said .			2

previously , the @entity6 did not *disclose* whether a *stopped* traveler was on the list or why
but facing legal pressure from the @entity36 , the @entity1 administration has *enacted* a new policy to let @entity6 know if they are on the list
grounded @entity6 are also now allowed to *inquire* about how they got on the list
however , the government has not promised to reveal why in all cases - citing possible national security threats
last fall there were about 64,000 people on the no - fly list , and @entity6 made up approximately 5 per cent
