by @entity0 published : 17:50 est , 15 august 2012 updated : 03:37 est , 16 august 2012 when @entity3 's @entity2 started dating @entity4 , it was clear he was never going to be best pals with her ex-boyfriend @entity6			2
but relations between the pair reached breaking point earlier tonight when @entity6 told @entity2 his sister @entity11 had claimed his relationship with the blonde fashionista would n't stand the test of time			2
although the duo initially seemed to have put their differences to one side as they attended a musical showcase by @entity3 co-star @entity21 , @entity2 later confronted @entity6 about his claims			2
fuming : @entity2 flew into a rage when @entity6 made comments about his sister @entity11 blood is thicker than water : @entity2 was angry that @entity6 had insinuated @entity11 doubted his relationship with @entity4 he said : ' i 've spoken to @entity11 , she says she did n't say that			2
blood is thicker than water , so obviously i side with her			2
' as @entity6 - who is now dating @entity34 - stood by his claims , it was n't long before the argument reached breaking point			1
shouting at his former pal outside the venue , @entity2 said in a foul - mouthed tirade : ' you 're a f * * * ing mug and you 're chatting s * * t about my sister			2
pipe the f * * k down and stop chatting s * * t about my family			2
friends : it initially seemed as though the boys had put their differences behind them a calming influence : but the night ended with @entity4 having to steer her boyfriend away from the fight ' you 're trying to make her sound like a b * * * h and you 're lying			0
you 're a doughnut , mate			0
' although @entity2 was eventually dragged away from the argument by @entity4 and her best pal , @entity62 , that certainly was n't it for fight night			0
@entity65 's triumphant , albeit brief , return to the show for sister @entity21 's performance was eclipsed by a whole host of other feuds coming to a climax			0
he 's back ! ' @entity71 of @entity3 ' @entity65 made his return to @entity3 to see his sister @entity21 perform a showcase of songs it was somewhat of a deja vu for @entity34 , who got into an angry shouting match with ex-boyfriend @entity71 and their mutual pal @entity79 at the gig			1
after @entity79 confessed his love for @entity71 last week , the sandwich shop owner was left fuming when he discovered the @entity84 lookalike had discussed his feelings with @entity34 , who had always suggested there was a hint of romance between the pair			1
a frustrated @entity71 said : ' she 's trying to dig up the past			1
i 'm trying to get a girlfriend and obviously i ca n't because there 's constant speculation that i 'm gay			0
' but after confronting @entity34 about her comments , it spiralled into a huge argument between the threesome			1
' you should have spoken to me ' : @entity79 was devastated when @entity71 reprimanded him for discussing his feelings with @entity34 @entity34 shouted : ' go and talk to your little boyfriend about it			1
@entity79 has been confiding in me and now you 're both ganging up at me			1
' you [ @entity79 ] come to me in my flat and confide in me and insinuate that something touchy - feely happened in @entity106			1
you two are a pair of @entity107			0
@entity3 is so two - faced			0
' elsewhere , the tension between former friends @entity110 and @entity111 continued to bubble , with @entity111 claiming she had proof the brunette bombshell 's fiance , @entity115 , had cheated on her with another girl			1
angry : @entity34 was absolutely fuming when ex-boyfriend @entity71 accused her of spreading rumours about him argument : @entity79 sided with his pal @entity71 over @entity34 @entity110 fumed to pals @entity4 and @entity62 : ' if she had proof why when i went round to her house , why did n't she give me it then rather than start it all up again ? what the f * * k ? ' the girl is a mutual friend of mine and @entity115			1
she 's investigating it to try and prove herself right			0
' the boutique owner also accused her blonde co-star of stabbing her in the back when over christmas 2010 she slept with @entity65 the same day @entity110 had split up with him			1
@entity110 added : ' this is n't the first time she 's stabbed me in the back			1
i broke up with @entity65 and she went home in a cab with him and s * * * * * d him that night			0
' she 's stabbed me in the back ' : @entity110 confided with @entity62 and @entity4 about the cheating rumours trust me : @entity115 insisted he had nothing to hide from @entity110 ' that 's not a friend			2
perhaps i should have drawn a line under it years ago			0
' and finally @entity146 went to confront new @entity3 playboy @entity147 after he recently bragged about sleeping with @entity146 's sister @entity149			1
he said : ' it 's disrespectful			0
it 's upset me , it 's upset my family			0
people have got the hump with you			0
' after @entity147 offered to send @entity149 a Â£ 50 bouquet of flowers , @entity146 flew off the handle - insisting only a face to face apology would do , and baffling @entity147 with his @entity3 lingo in the meantime			1
he fumed : ' i want you to say sorry to her face , she do n't want flowers from you			0
i think you 're a bit of a mug			0
a proper lunchbox , i think you are			0
' ' you 're a lunchbox ' : @entity146 confronted @entity147 after he bragged about sleeping with @entity146 's sister @entity149			1
