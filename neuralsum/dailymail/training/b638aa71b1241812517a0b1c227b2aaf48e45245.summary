for many people a day out in the sunshine is not complete without a visit to an ice cream van , but unfortunately sometimes a 99 can prove disappointing and messy			1
however , in a bid to cure people of @entity7 ' angle - angst ' - which , apparently , is rife - a scientist claims to have cracked the formula for the perfect 99 ice cream			1
his research found the recipe for a successful 99 means a flake should sit at precisely 45 degrees , have 35 per cent ' chocolate crumbliness ' and the ice cream should be chilled to minus 15 ° @entity17 a scientist ( not pictured ) claims to have cracked the formula for the perfect 99 ice cream			2
the research commissioned by @entity20 found the perfect recipe for a successful 99 means a flake sitting at precisely 45 degrees , 35 per cent chocolate crumbliness and ice cream chilled to minus 15 the study is said to have come about after @entity20 , which makes the flakes for the ice creams , received phone calls from seriously concerned 99 lovers who were worried about the angle the flake was served at in their cone			1
the company sought out an expert to come up with the ideal way in which the ice cream should be constructed , which will be shared with the @entity36 - the @entity38 trade association for ice cream manufacturers and retailers - which might mean customers will be more satisfied with their 99s in future			2
68 per cent of people consider the flake is the most crucial part and just over half insist the chocolate must sit at a 45 degree angle , the study said @entity49 , a professor at @entity50 questioned 1000 @entity38 over the iconic ice cream			1
he found 68 per cent of enthusiasts consider the flake is the most crucial part - as they like to use it as a spoon - and just over half insist the chocolate must sit at a 45 degree angle			0
around 55 per cent of people polled claim to suffer ' angle - angst ' , while 18 per cent are worried they will be poked in the eye if the flake is at any angle other than vertical			1
around 55 per cent of people deliberately eat that flake first while 28 per cent find the ice cream tastier with the chocolate in it			1
more than half of people believe the perfect ratio for the amount of solid chocolate to crumbliness is between 35 and 50 per cent			0
the optimum temperature was decided by @entity73 , one of @entity75 ’s biggest ice cream fleets			0
at minus 15 degrees @entity17 , the ice cream does n’t freeze the teeth but is cold enough so it does n’t melt straight away			0
@entity78 , spokesman for @entity7 predictably said : ' the actual origin of a ‘ 99 ’ is lost in the mists of time but the most common explanation is when the @entity84 was launched , the @entity38 ice cream industry was dominated by @entity85			0
' at the time there was a legend that a former @entity88 had surrounded himself with an elite bodyguard of 99 soldiers so , to @entity85 , the number 99 signified excellence			0
' over half of people deliberately eat that flake first while 28 per cent find the ice cream tastier with the chocolate in it			2

professor @entity49 found that 55 *%* of people polled claim to suffer ' angle - angst ' - the fear of the flake falling out of their soft ice cream
a total of 18 per cent of people *surveyed* claimed to be worried they will be poked in the eye if the flake is at any angle other than vertical
