millions of ducks raised for the dinner table are being denied essentials like a pond to swim and bathe in , warns the @entity4			1
the charity is calling on families to boycott duck meat until farmers and supermarkets implement dramatic improvements to the way the birds are treated			0
it says the reality for the 14.3m ducks reared for meat in the @entity17 every year is very different from the @entity19 and @entity20 view of farm life			1
the @entity4 said not one of these ducks are raised according to the minimum welfare standards it supports under its ‘ @entity40 ’ scheme and it is demanding new laws to improve conditions			1
however , producers insist there is no need to provide ponds as ducks ‘ have a low motivation to swim for any length of time ’			1
a survey by the @entity4 found most consumers have no idea how the ducks are raised and most would be appalled that they do not get access to water to swim and bathe in			1
calling for action : the @entity4 wants conditions to improve for the millions of ducks reared for meat in the @entity17 there are no legal requirements to provide farmed ducks with anything other than water to drink , and the duck industry ’s own standards , through the @entity69 scheme , only require ducks to be able to cover their heads with water			1
welfare expert at the @entity4 , dr @entity75 , said : ‘ @entity24 are waterfowl , therefore they should be provided with water that allows them full body access			2
this is not only good for their health , as it helps keep their eyes , nostrils and feathers clean , but it also allows them to do the things they naturally want to do			0
‘ it is disheartening that we are in a situation where the vast majority of farmed ducks are not provided with full body access to water			0
‘ we want consumers to know the facts about how farmed ducks have been reared , and we want the industry to take on board the evidence within the report and help improve the lives of millions of ducks			0
’ a @entity101 survey for the @entity4 found that four in ten parents are likely to take children to a local pond or lake to feed the ducks			2
yet the vast majority - 93 per cent - were unaware that it is not a legal requirement for farmed ducks to have bathing water they can get into			0
there are no legal requirements to provide farmed ducks with anything other than water to drink , and the duck industry ’s own standards only require ducks to be able to cover their heads with water some 78 per cent were ‘ appalled ’ that ducks farmed for their meat may never get access to bathing water			1
a new @entity4 report calls on shoppers to stop buying the meat until improvements are made			2
it warns : ‘ it is very difficult for consumers to find any meat from ducks reared to welfare standards the @entity4 would find acceptable			1
‘ so unless they can be confident that this is the case , they are strongly encourage to avoid buying duck meat due to welfare concerns associated with poorer rearing conditions			0
’ ‘ unfortunately current @entity17 law does not require water to be provided to ducks for anything other than drinking , and ducks may only have access to water from drinkers such as nipple drinkers			2
‘ we believe the law should be changed so that producers are legally required to provide farmed ducks with suitable open water facilities that allow them fully body access			0
’ the @entity156 said ducks do not need water to swim and bathe in and it is not practical for farmers to provide it			2
the organisation claimed ducks ‘ have a low motivation to swim for any length of time ’			1
@entity17 favourite : the @entity4 have called on shoppers to stop buying the meat until improvements are made it has set up a @entity169 ( @entity169 ) to cover rearing policies and ensures there is enough water to allow the ducks to dip their heads in and use the water to preen their feathers			1
the @entity156 said the standards used by the @entity4 ‘ have been drawn up by a working group lacking in any practical experience of growing ducks on a commercial scale ’			0
it said : ‘ it is not practical to provide deep water for swimming - especially in indoor systems - and ducks do have a low motivation to swim for any length of time			1
‘ open water sources , particularly those in which ducks can get in , have poor water quality which can lead to bacterial infections of the eyes and nostrils			0
keeping eyes , nostrils , feet and plumage clean is key to good duck health and welfare and is provided for the form of open water resource in the @entity169			0
‘ the @entity169 requires that ducks must have sufficient space to be able to sit without interference from other birds , to exhibit normal behaviour , to bathe , and have access to wholesome feed and clean fresh drinking water			0
‘ @entity169 standards are built on science and are regularly reviewed and amended where new research supports good practice in the industry			0

@entity4 wants conditions improved for 14.3m ducks reared for meat in @entity17
most are crammed into barns in their thousands , never getting to swim
producers say there is no need for ponds as ducks have ' low motivation '
78 *%* of *people* in survey were appalled ducks had no water to bathe in
