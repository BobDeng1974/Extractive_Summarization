by @entity0 few people live to tell the tale of being trapped on a large ship sinking in the middle of the open sea			0
but now terrifying footage has emerged capturing exactly what it would be like to be stuck on board a vessel as it goes down - slowly disappearing into the deep as waves crash all around			1
the chilling film was shot on board the @entity14 , also known as @entity15 , using high - definition @entity17 cameras as it sank in the middle of @entity21 in @entity22 last year			1
the more water the ship takes on , the heavier it becomes , pushing the vessel increasingly lower until water begins lapping over its sides			1
very quickly the ship begins to tilt to the left , allowing the water to almost completely cover the deck			1
the sheer weight of the water continues to drag the port side of the ship down , and within seconds the camera itself is under water			1
the footage then becomes slightly unsteady and the water fills with bubbles - both of which gives the terrifying impression of someone gasping for air as they are sucked below the surface			0
after several disorientating moments of the camera being struck by debris , the footage eventually settles into an eerie calm as the ship appears to come to a rest on the bed of the lake			2
the video then cuts to another camera positioned inside what appears to be the ship 's hull			0
although dimly lit , several shards of daylight force their way into the hull - letting the viewer know that the footage is once again back before the ship sunk			0
the vessel begins to rock however , and after one particularly large lurch forward water begins gushing into the interior - filling it from floor to ceiling in little over a second			0
incoming : the enclosed space is filled from floor to ceiling in a matter of seconds once water gets in the footage was published on @entity113 by @entity114 - the owners of a chartered diving ship which operates out of @entity117 in @entity22 once again debris crashes into the camera before everything goes eerily calm - the viewer given a strange insight into what it must be like to have gone down with a ship			1
the footage , published by the @entity127 and @entity114 - the owners of a chartered diving ship which operates out of @entity117 in @entity22			2
according to the company 's @entity113 channel the cameras were installed on @entity14 by @entity132 of @entity133 shortly before it went down in february 2013			0
the doomed vessel remains 75 feet below the surface of @entity21 , in a stretch of water close to @entity139 .			2

chilling film was shot on board @entity14 in @entity21 , @entity22
two *hd* cameras capture the terrifying moment the ship went down
footage begins by *showing* the vessel taking on a small amount of water
