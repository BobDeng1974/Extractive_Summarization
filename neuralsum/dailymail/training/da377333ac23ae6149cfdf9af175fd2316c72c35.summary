the @entity10 superstar had endured a miserable afternoon - that included being overshadowed by former @entity13 misfit @entity12 - before he let his frustration get the better of him late in the game			0
in an astonishing sequence of events , @entity3 was initially unfortunate not to be sent off after taking a full - blooded swing at @entity19 , which fortunately for the @entity8 defender was as accurate as the @entity7 striker 's shooting during the game			2
@entity3 's loses his composure by kicking out at @entity26 defender @entity25 to earn himself a red card @entity3 's moments of madness began when he appeared to take a full blooded punch at @entity8 defender @entity19 fortunately for the @entity7 star the incident was missed by the referee , although @entity3 's actions would catch up with him @entity3 's punch was as accurate as some of his shooting during a game that he was overshadowed by former @entity13 misfit @entity12 the @entity7 superstar 's customised @entity3 boot clearly makes contact with the defender 's leg @entity25 's team - mate @entity19 ( right ) reacts after being involved in an earlier altercation with the @entity10 @entity3 appears to claim there is nothing wrong as the @entity26 defender goes down shamefully clutching his face the 29 - year - old urges his victim to get up as he is confronted by angry @entity8 players at the @entity54 stadium @entity3 raises his arm as @entity8 defender @entity19 moves closer following his kick at @entity58 in a final act of petulance , @entity3 takes a backhand swipe at @entity62 before being shown the red card by the referee @entity3 can only offer a nonchalant shrug as referee @entity66 shows him the red card the @entity7 talisman saw his team reduced to 10 - men in the closing stages , although @entity8 's @entity71 was also sent off later @entity7 defender @entity72 , no stranger to getting sent off himself , tries to calm the situation down @entity74 consoles his close friend and team - mate as @entity3 leaves the field for an early shower @entity3 appeared to look at the badge on his shirt as he left the field and passed coach @entity81 @entity3 heads into the dressing room with the game still balanced at 1 - 1 in the race for the @entity86 title fortunately for @entity7 , @entity74 was on hand to score a late winning penalty to take his side clear in @entity86 the 28 - year - old then followed this by kicking the leg of @entity93 , who disgracefully went down clutching his face , to earn a red card after failing to reach a through ball as @entity7 chased a winner with the game level at 1 - 1			1
finally , when his earlier victim @entity19 reacted to @entity3 's obvious foul on his team - mate - the three times @entity100 winner took a backhand swipe at his face before heading towards the dressing rooms for an early shower			0
with @entity3 out of equation it was left to @entity74 to take any set - pieces and when his late free - kick was handled by @entity113 , who evened the playing field by being sent off , the @entity108 stepped up to score the winning penalty and send @entity7 four points clear at the top of @entity86 ahead of @entity120 's game with @entity121 .			0
