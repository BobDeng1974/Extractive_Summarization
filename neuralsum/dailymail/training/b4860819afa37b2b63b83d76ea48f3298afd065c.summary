by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity2 : 23:31 est , 30 december 2013 @entity3 : 05:26 est , 31 december 2013 @entity4 has walked into trouble in the exclusive beachside community where she bought an $ 18million vacation home this summer - building an enormous sea wall that has left local residents furious			1
after the 24 - year - old singer purchased the largest and most lavish property in @entity12 , @entity1 - a neighborhood filled with large and lavish properties – she began rebuilding a seawall on the beach in front of the mansion			1
the construction project , which began with no public notice , has made some neighbors and longtime residents of the area furious because it restricts access to a public beach and interferes with fishermen and surfers who have been using the stretch of sand for generations			1
‘ i do n’t know how the hell they let her do this without approval or nothing , ’ a furious @entity41 , 76 , told @entity31 as he climbed atop the wall to survey the development			0
mr @entity41 has been fishing on the @entity12 beach since he moved to the neighborhood in 1961			1
the new boulders piled in front of the wall , he says , will block him – or anyone else – from getting around the seawall and cross the public beach			2
@entity67 , 31 , who was born and raised in the nearby town of @entity69 , @entity1 , said that the construction covers up years of history			2
the seawall has been a popular spot for teenagers to hangout for longer than he ’s been alive			0
it ’s also become a makeshift memorial of sorts of for his friend @entity79 , who drowned there in 2004			0
i ca n't believe it : @entity41 expresses his disbelief at the huge construction work going on behind him at @entity4 's @entity1 home rage : @entity41 walks past @entity4 's seawall at her @entity1 home which is on a historic part of the @entity92 coast too high : mr. @entity41 explained that the wall was constructed without necessary approval and has become an eyesore the construction work has covered over the memorial			1
and @entity4 's security guards have begun chasing residents off the sea wall - even though the previous owners allowed locals to use it for decades , mr @entity67 said			1
‘ there ’s a lot of meaning in that wall			0
now nobody will be able to use it , ’ he said			0
other residents say that the new construction on the seawall is an eyesore			2
it is the only structure jutting out in a long stretch of idyllic @entity92 beach			1
a publicist for @entity4 did not immediately respond to a request for comment			2
the construction has caught residents off guard			0
@entity4 did not have to acquire building permits from the town and only had to obtain permission from the state @entity127 – an environmental organization that held no hearings before granting her permission to undertake the construction – estimated at more than a million dollars			1
‘ i just ca n’t believe she did n’t need permits for it , ’ 48 - year - old @entity133 said			1
guard : construction outside a property owned by @entity4 's is getting attention from locals of @entity141 for changes to the shoreline at a public beach where many swim , surf and fish lavish : @entity4 's new ritzy $ 17m beach front @entity1 home			1
according to @entity150 reports , the pop superstar paid just over $ 17m in cash to secure this 5 bedroomed , 11,000 square foot , beach front property in @entity1 's upmarket @entity157 @entity158 , a spokeswoman for the @entity127 , said the seawall itself predates @entity4 's purchase of the 1930 home - and possibly dates back to the 1938 hurricane the savaged the coast			1
@entity4 is merely bringing it back up to standard after decades of disrepair , she told @entity31			2
residents were happy when @entity4 purchased the 11,000 - square - foot @entity168 this summer			1
she reportedly bought it outright with a single $ 17.75million wire transfer			2
@entity12 has long been a playground for the extremely wealthy – the @entity168 itself was built by a @entity174 heiress			2
but @entity4 brought a fame to the wealthy community that it has n’t seen in decades			0
then , just days after the purchase , a fan , @entity178 , 22 , of @entity179 , was arrested trying to enter the property			0
@entity182 of the ball : popstar @entity4 at the @entity185 dinner at @entity186 in november ( left ) and ( right ) at the @entity187 held at @entity188 in november @entity4 responded by ringing the property with a six foot fence and posting security guard on the premises 24 hours a day – even when she is n’t there			1
on monday as mr @entity41 examined the seawall , two guards peered down from the cliff above – watching him			0
minutes later , a @entity69 police cruiser arrived in the driveway of the home			0
' i 'm sure she 's a perfectly nice lady , she just does n't know what this is all doing to us here , ' mr @entity67 said			0
residents say @entity4 spent little time at the property last summer			1
it was mostly used by her parents @entity210 and @entity211			0
' one who the guys who lives on the other side of her , he is p * * * * d because she put up that six - foot fence all along his property line , ' mr @entity41 , the fisherman , said			0
' he 's thinking of selling his house because of her			0

pop superstar @entity4 has enraged her neighbors by erecting a huge seawall by her @entity12 , @entity1 property
neighbors have demanded to know why she is being allowed to build they eyesore along the historic stretch of @entity92 coastline
the 24 - year - old popstar has employed a crack - security team to watch the property after it was broken into over the summer
the @entity234 *winner* has *allegedly* not gone through regular channels to get permission for the wall
the singer reportedly paid over $ 17 million in cash for the home
