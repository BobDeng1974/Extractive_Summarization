by @entity0 for @entity1 campaigners stamping @entity5 , pro-palestine messages on bank notes could be prosecuted for defacing currency , the @entity2 has warned			1
banknotes bearing a ' free @entity9 ! boycott @entity11 ! ! ! ' stamp have surfaced in @entity12 , @entity13 , sparking anger among locals			1
the @entity2 says it is illegal to deface currency - but the notes remain legal tender			1
but one grandfather , who has been given one of the notes from a shop in @entity23 , was not happy to be handed the defaced £ 5			1
the 67 - year - old , who would only identify himself as @entity25 , said he received the note on sunday , august 17 , after he picked up his paper			0
the offending £ 5 bank note , with the @entity30 message stamped on it he did not see the message at first because the note was folded up as it was given to him , but when he noticed it later he became annoyed			1
he says he found out it came from the shop after speaking to two other residents in the area who received similar notes			0
the production worker said : ' i paid with a £ 10 note and received the fiver back folded in half , so i did n't realise the stamp at first			2
but when i took it home there it was plain as day			0
it is defacing the @entity48 's currency			1
if i wrote " free @entity49 , boycott so and so " on our notes i 'd be in the police station quicker than i could think			2
' it 's a political statement on our currency which is out of order			1
it is premeditated , not just written out of temper			0
i think whoever is responsible should be taken to task about it			0
' the manager of the @entity61 , @entity12 , shop said he wanted to get his political message across to his customers			2
the shop boss , who wanted only to be known as @entity66 , said : ' it 's simply based on what is currently going on at the moment to make people aware about what cause they need to be supporting			0
' what @entity11 is doing is wrong , and we need to boycott them and support @entity9			2
putting a little stamp on the notes is our way of raising awareness and getting the message across using a political message			2
' some people have come in and asked what it 's about , and some have realised that it is a good thing			0
others do n't understand it , but there has n't been too much negativity			0
' a shop customer pictured with one of the stamped bank notes which have angered locals the @entity2 - which issues the country 's bank notes - confirmed it was illegal to deface currency - but stressed they were still legal tender even if they had been stamped			1
a spokesman for the @entity2 said : ' defacing bank notes is definitely not something we would recommend but whether or not there would be a prosecution would be up to the @entity107 to determine if it was in the public interest			1
' we would advise people not to do it because one of the really important things is maintaining confidence in our currency and people being able to spot counterfeit money			0
' the notes are legal tender but they would probably be taken out of circulation when they entered our processing plants			0
