police say @entity10 was shot dead monday after she drove a stolen car toward an officer in a residential alley in @entity3			1
the @entity3 shooting also brought protests and a demand for a special prosecutor			2
on friday , @entity10 's family called for a federal civil rights investigation into her death			1
in a statement released in @entity66 and @entity67 , @entity10 's parents said they want the @entity69 @entity68 to investigate her death , and for @entity69 attorney @entity70 in @entity71 to oversee the criminal investigation of the officers involved			1
the family said it does n't trust @entity3 police to conduct a fair and timely investigation , and that the department has a history of exonerating its officers			1
the statement came after the parents retained lawyer @entity82 , who has been involved in a number of other high - profile civil rights cases against @entity3 police and sheriff 's deputies			1
@entity82 represented a former @entity3 jail inmate to whom the city paid $ 3.3million in july to settle a jail abuse lawsuit			2
the allegations in the lawsuit filed by @entity93 were so egregious they prompted a federal judge to request a @entity69 @entity68 investigation into the city 's police and the sheriff 's departments			1
in the shooting of @entity10 , police chief @entity100 has said the two officers repeatedly told her and four other teens to get out of the stolen car			2

the incident remained under investigation			0
a passenger in the car , who spoke to @entity118 on condition of anonymity because of safety concerns , has disputed that account , saying the officers did not yell commands before they shot @entity10 through the driver 's side window			1
the passenger also claimed that @entity10 lost control of the vehicle because she was unconscious after being shot			2
@entity100 said it 's too soon to judge whether officers @entity130 , a 16 - year - veteran , and @entity132 , a nine - year - veteran of the force , acted appropriately in shooting @entity10			2
@entity132 suffered a fractured leg			0
no one has been charged with the theft of the car , a 2000 @entity138 that was reported missing sunday night in @entity139			0
@entity140 , @entity1 's mother , on wednesday called for an independent autopsy on her daughter because she does not trust the official investigation			1
the request came as the @entity144 and an independent city official who monitors the agency disclosed that separate investigations were underway into policies regarding officers shooting at moving vehicles			2
a shrine in remembrance of @entity1 's life was set up at her family 's home			2
she leaves behind five siblings a passenger in the car said @entity1 ( pictured left and right ) lost control of the vehicle after being shot mrs @entity1 , a mother of six , said : ' i want another autopsy on my daughter so we can know how much damage they did			1
' ' i want to know , how did this happen ? i want to know everything			0
' @entity10 's mother said her daughter made a mistake by ' grabbing ' a car that did not belong to her but did n't deserve to pay with her life			1
she said : ' how much do they need to investigate ? ' ' it 's all done			0
all i want is justice			0
the grieving mother also criticized the way police handled her daughter after she was shot			0
she said : ' they dragged her on the floor and threw her down like a piece of garbage , ' the shooting was the fourth time in seven months that @entity3 police have fired at a moving vehicle after perceiving it as a threat			1
protester @entity197 waves a sign before a meeting with officials from the @entity202 's office @entity68 policy encourages officers to move out of the way of a moving car rather than use their firearm			0
but it also allows them to shoot if they have no other reasonable way to prevent death or serious injury			0
the incidents have prompted the department and the city 's independent monitor to review policies and training related to such shootings			0
investigators in the @entity3 case will be relying on witnesses and police accounts because the department has only just started to buy body cameras for its officers and @entity132 and @entity130 were not yet outfitted			2
@entity3 does not use in - car dashboard cameras			0
prosecutors promised a thorough probe of the shooting as a group of angry protesters demanded swift answers and called for a special prosecutor to investigate the death earlier this week			0
a vigil in the alleyway in which the teenager was shot dead was also held			0
candles and bouquets were left near the scene of the fatal police shooting in an alleyway in northeast @entity3 flowers were put out , candles were lit and a rosary was draped over a portrait of @entity1 at her home the @entity69 @entity249 has held that officers may not use deadly force to stop a fleeing suspect unless the person is believed to pose significant physical harm			1
policies vary and some departments have banned or discouraged the practice			0
the police department and independent monitor @entity258 are both looking at how national standards compare to @entity3 's policy			1
the city currently allows officers to fire at moving cars if they have no other reasonable way to prevent death or serious injury			0
@entity3 's policy urges officers to try to move out of the way rather than fire			2
it states : ' an officer threatened by an oncoming vehicle shall , if feasible , move out of the way rather than discharging a firearm			0
' experts say shooting and disabling a driver can send a car out of control .			0
