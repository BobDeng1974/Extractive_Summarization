by @entity0 published : 08:41 est , 17 october 2013 updated : 09:41 est , 17 october 2013 a @entity2 man went looking for sharks on his paddleboard on wednesday , but he ended up being the one watched when a 9 - foot great white shark came right up to his board			1
@entity8 had already spotted one of the juvenile sharks as he plied the waters off @entity12			1
when that one swam away , he thought the thrill had ended			0
then another beast came right at him			0
' hopefully he 's not coming to get me			2
' ' @entity25 s * * t ! he 's checking me out , ' says @entity8 as the torpedo - shaped shark swims directly under the paddleboard			1
the encounter lasts only a moment , but the shark 's proximity understandably rattles the veteran surfer			2
' i 'm shaking like a leaf , ' he says as he gasps for air			0
' @entity35 ! ' ' i 'm shaking like a leaf ! ' : the 9 - foot great white shark spent some time cruising around @entity38 , who is understandably rattled in the video he captured of the encounter circling : as the beast circled , @entity8 kept his camera steadily trained on the 9 - foot juvenile great white @entity38 's curious shark was a juvenile , about half the length of a full - grown adult			1
the largest specimens of great whites , which frequent waters off the coasts of every continent but @entity53 , can grow in excess of 20 feet and are able to detect a single drop of blood in 25 gallons of water			0
@entity8 and his employees at @entity59 , a site that posts free surf reports and streams surf cameras , posted his heart pumping footage on @entity64 and the story quickly spread to local news			1
but the original post on @entity38 's @entity64 account likely sums the experience up best : ' it 's all fun until someone loses an eye , ( or leg )			0
' memorable : after some very tense moments , the shark swam away and @entity8 was left with a very thrilling story to take back to his friends and family -- and thanks to his video , to the entire world first time for everything : @entity8 is a veteran surfer , but his experience shark - seeing on a paddle board has become one of his more memorable experiences thankful : surfer , family man , and now a relieved paddleboarder , @entity8 caught his video with a @entity24 camera as he paddled			2
he runs @entity91 , a site that offers free surf reports and streaming surf cams			0

@entity8 was *enjoying* the waters off @entity2 's @entity12
@entity8 saw two of the juvenile sharks , but only one came directly up to his paddleboard
