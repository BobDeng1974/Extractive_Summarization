one of football 's great novelties will take place on thursday afternoon as @entity4 and @entity5 draw lots to decide which will advance from @entity6 at the @entity7			1
the two nations finished joint second behind the @entity10 with identical records - they both drew all three of their matches , scored three times and conceded three times			1
and so , at 3pm @entity16 time during a @entity18 meeting at the @entity19 , a ball will be picked out of a pot to determine which of the pair will take on @entity23 in the quarter - final on sunday			1
@entity4 and @entity5 will learn their @entity7 fate when lots are drawn on thursday afternoon @entity5 coach @entity28 has been outspoken in his criticism of the drawn lots system his @entity4 counterpart @entity31 was in agreement at the harshness of the drawn lots method a statement on the official tournament website explained the procedure : ' in pursuant to @entity38 of the regulations of the @entity40 , a random draw will be conducted to determine the second place team in @entity43 , between @entity4 and @entity5			1
' the draw will take place during the meeting of the @entity47 of the @entity7 on thursday , 29 january 2015 at 16h00 local time at the @entity49			1
' there will be two balls with position two ( 2 ) and position three ( 3 ) , and the representative of the two teams will pick a ball from the pot. the one who picks position two ( 2 ) qualifies for the quarter final			2
' the drawing of lots is certainly a cruel way to be eliminated from any football tournament since it comes down entirely to luck rather than skill			0
and that 's not been lost on the two managers , who have been outspoken in their criticism of this ' last resort ' of splitting teams			1
' we have to solve the problems of qualification without a drawing of lots , ' said the @entity4 coach @entity31 after his team drew 1 - 1 with @entity5 on wednesday afternoon			1
' we must find a more sporting way			0
this does not correspond to a sporting spirit			0
' his @entity5 counterpart @entity28 agreed : ' @entity4 do not deserve to be eliminated in this way , just as we do not			1
' @entity5 's @entity83 celebrates converting a penalty to give his team the lead against @entity4 @entity4 forward @entity86 ( centre ) is congratulated after scoring their equalising goal on 49 minutes january 20 @entity10 1 @entity5 1 @entity4 1 @entity90 1 january 24 @entity10 1 @entity4 1 @entity90 1 @entity5 1 january 28 @entity90 0 @entity10 1 guinea 1 @entity4 1 january 31 @entity91 vs @entity91 ( @entity92 ) 4pm @entity16 time @entity94 vs @entity5 ( @entity92 ) 7pm both live on @entity16 @entity96 february 1 @entity10 vs @entity97 ( @entity98 ) 4pm @entity23 vs @entity4 / @entity5 ( @entity98 ) 7pm both live on @entity16 @entity96 both camps have endured an agonising wait , with the draw originally due to take place immediately after the match before being moved to thursday			1
it is not without precedent at the @entity7			0
in 1988 , @entity97 went through from the group at the expense of the @entity10 following the drawing of lots			0
and this situation has also arisen at the @entity112 on two occasions			0
in 1954 , a qualifying match between @entity115 and @entity116 played in @entity117 ended in stalemate and a 14 - year - old boy , the son of a stadium employee , was called onto the pitch to draw lots from a trophy			2
he picked out @entity115 , sending them to the @entity112 finals in @entity126 and condemning @entity116 to a summer at home			0
the drawing of lots ceremony will mean an anxious wait for fans of both nations and at the @entity134 finals in @entity135 , the @entity136 and @entity137 were tied for second place in their group			2
both were guaranteed qualification for the second round but their ranking had to be determined and so @entity148 , then @entity143 's second - in - command , drew lots live on television in @entity117			2
he inserted a slip of paper bearing each teams ' names into each of two orange plastic balls and then marked another two yellow balls with the numbers 2 and 3 for the positions			0
he then asked a @entity112 hostess in a blue uniform to pull a ball from each bowl			0
the decision proved crucial - @entity165 drew @entity166 in the last 16 and beat them , while the @entity167 were paired with eventual winners @entity168 and went out .			0

the lucky team will face @entity23 in sunday 's quarter - final
