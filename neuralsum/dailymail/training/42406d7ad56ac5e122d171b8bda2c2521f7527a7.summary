by @entity1 correspondent mums have long advised their young daughters to ignore the antics of teenage boys because girls are far more sensible anyway			1
now there ’s research to back up their theory – after a study found that the brain matures earlier in girls than in boys			1
the @entity13 researchers said this could help explain why teenage girls seem to grow up faster than their male classmates			1
a study of 121 people between the ages of four and 40 has found that the brain matures earlier in girls than in boys the @entity13 researchers said the speed at which the brain matures could help explain why teenage girls seem to grow up faster than their male classmates as we get older , parts of the brain become smaller as unnecessary connections between cells are pruned away , leaving a more streamlined and efficient processing machine			1
the scientists used scans to peer deep inside the brains of 121 people aged between four and 40			1
this showed that the pruning process began at around the age of ten for girls – but not until around 20 for men			2
explaining the brain ’s streamlining process , researcher dr @entity36 said : ‘ this is part of the normal learning process			2
the brain as a whole is still expanding but it is losing connections			2
‘ it is like if you are at a party and everyone is talking and you ca n’t concentrate			0
but if some of the voices go , it is easier to hear			0
the pruning process began at around the age of ten for girls ¿ but not until around 20 for men ‘ it is similar in the brain			1
if some of the connections are not there , it is easier to do the work			0
’ the study , published in journal @entity63 , also showed that key , long - distance connections between brain regions are preserved			0
researcher @entity66 said : ‘ the loss of connectivity during brain development can actually help to improve brain function by reorganizing the network more efficiently			0
‘ say instead of talking to many people at random , asking a couple of people who have lived in the area for a long time is the most efficient way to know your way			0
‘ in a similar way , reducing some projections in the brain helps to focus on essential information			0

brain begins to streamline for girls at age 10 , but not until boys reach 20
