@entity2 will continue to buzz @entity3 with its long - range bombers at the same intensity for the whole year , a top @entity1 commander has made clear			1
recent weeks have twice seen @entity7 fighter jets scrambled to escort @entity9 bombers as they flew close to @entity3 airspace , but there will be no let - up			1
general - lieutenant @entity13 , commander of @entity9 long distance military aviation , has made clear in comments not previously reported in the @entity17 that the bomber flights will remain at a high level throughout 2015			1
this would apply not only to flights in the eastern @entity34 , but also over the @entity36 , @entity37 and @entity38 oceans , he stressed			0
@entity13 said that in 2015 , @entity39 will get six more upgraded @entity41 strategic bomber planes , and the @entity42 will rise to 43			1
general - lieutenant @entity13 , photographed alongside @entity9 president , @entity45 his words were echoed by the commander of the @entity9 air force , who hit back at @entity50 press reports over the flights close to @entity53 borders			1
' it is true that our long distance aviation airplanes are flying and will be flying to the remote geographic regions to the furthest allowed distance , ' said @entity59			0
' it is necessary for training the crews and for keeping an eye on the capacity of the planes			2
' all flights are performed in strict accordance with the international rules of air space usage - only over the neutral waters without entering the air space or breaking the borders of other countries			0
the military chief 's comments come following two incidents in which @entity9 jets were escorted by @entity77 after being caught flying near @entity3 airspace ' according to the plan of strategic deterrence , the flights of long distance aviation will be continued as a part of military training and with the same intensity , ' said general - lieutenant @entity13 ' at the same time , almost all the flights of our planes are accompanied by fighter planes of @entity53 countries or their partners whose aviation bases are located not far from the route of our aircraft			1
' the intensity of @entity53 and @entity99 intelligence flights have increased since 2014 , and the number of such flights above the @entity103 and @entity104 seas is eight to 12 per week			0
' retired general @entity105 , formerly head of the @entity9 air force , even issued a taunt that ' the @entity108 have forgotten what we can do ' , referring to the frequency of flights in the @entity113 , which have now returned			2
' we have always performed at our best against those who instigate us to start a conflict , ' he warned , using rhetoric redolent of the @entity125 era when these ' behind the corner ' flights - pilots ' slang for a routing along the @entity122 peninsula towards @entity3 - were common			2
defence secretary @entity126 last week said that the frequency of recent flights - such as those close to @entity129 and @entity130 by @entity9 warplanes capable of carrying nuclear weapons - were on a scale not seen since the end of the @entity113			1
since january last year , there have been at least 17 shows of military strength by @entity39 near the @entity3			1
the most serious included : wednesday : @entity7 jets scrambled after two @entity9 @entity9 bombers spotted off the coast of @entity129			2
feb 15 : @entity9 warship intercepted by @entity142 in the @entity143			0
jan 28 : @entity7 fighters challenge two @entity9 bombers capable of carrying nuclear missiles south of @entity147			0
jan 8 : defence chiefs ask for @entity99 help to hunt a suspected @entity9 submarine lurking off the coast of @entity152			2
nov 2014 : @entity9 flotilla on military exercise in the @entity143 escorted from @entity3 waters by @entity156			1
nov 2014 : @entity53 aircraft called in to hunt suspected @entity9 submarine off the west coast of @entity152			0
oct 2014 : @entity7 @entity7 warplanes shadow two @entity161 as they fly down the west coast of @entity3			1
he also branded @entity45 ' a very real and present danger ' to @entity3 's allies in the @entity166			1
@entity9 tv station @entity167 , backed by the @entity169 in @entity2 , released a video of @entity3 and @entity172 fighter jets escorting a tu - 95 bear earlier this week			1
the film was shot from inside the cockpit of the long range bomber			0
@entity9 military expert @entity177 told the same channel : ' we are not such nit - picking people			1
' we do not make noise in press each time a @entity53 plane flies close to our borders or our aircraft when they are on a military mission			0
' something that is a routine matter for our pilots , for them turns into a reason for hysteria a la @entity113 times			0
' @entity2 claims that @entity53 countries are similarly drastically increasing their probing flights close to @entity9 territory			1
in 2014 , @entity53 intelligence aviation performed more than 200 flights close to @entity9 borders , compared with 2013 when there were 125 flights			1
' the devices on board of such planes allow investigation of the whole territory of @entity204 , ' said @entity59 , referring to @entity39 's exclave in the @entity103 , between @entity53 countries @entity206 and @entity207			1
' the routes of these flights are very close to the @entity9 border and it allows to perform radio - electronic intelligence up to 500 kilometres deep into the territory and to follow the work schedule and characteristics of army management , anti-aircraft systems and aviation			2
' the flights of @entity99 strategic intelligence @entity220 planes are made almost daily			2
prime minister @entity222 ( left ) dismissed last week 's incident , saying the @entity39 ' are trying to make some sort of a point			2
he said that the action , authorised by @entity9 president @entity45 ( right ) , should not have been dignified ' with too much of a response ' ' for example , in 2014 there were about 140 @entity220 flights , and in 2013 there were only 22			1
' @entity2 's ambassador to @entity233 , dr @entity232 , this week echoed that view			0
he said : ' military activity by @entity53 aircraft at @entity9 borders is far more intense , having doubled since early 2014 , reaching 3,000 sorties that year			2
' by way of comparison , @entity9 reconnaissance aircraft carried out just over 200 sorties over the @entity103 area from march to december 2014 , compared with 125 over the same period in 2013			0
' the growing disparity between the actual situation and the official rhetoric of some @entity50 leaders is not helpful for restoring trust , which is probably the main victim of the crisis in relations between @entity39 and the @entity17			0
' last week , air chief marshal @entity252 , a former chief of the defence staff , said planes packed with holidaymakers could be brought down by @entity9 jets in a highly dangerous ' game of chicken '			1
two @entity9 bombers last week skirted @entity3 airspace off the coast of @entity129 , where they were intercepted and escorted by two @entity7 fighters			1
the two @entity77 , armed with air - to - air missiles , were launched from @entity263 in @entity264 after the @entity9 bombers were spotted at 6.30pm on wednesday			0
they were escorted as they flew south , then turned around and flew north past the @entity268 coast			0
heavily armed : the video released earlier this week by a @entity1 - backed tv station showed the full arsenal of the @entity7 jet as it flies next to the bomber			0
the tail badge shows it comes from @entity275 that incident came after one of the huge @entity113 - era @entity280 planes was spotted in the skies off the coast of @entity147 last month			0
@entity252 said the flights were not ' joy rides ' but ' mission rehearsals ' designed to test @entity3 's capability to react			1
speaking on @entity289 's @entity288 programme , he said : ' they are becoming more aggressive			0
' these aircraft - @entity9 bears for example - are not going on these very flights simply as joy rides			2
' these aircraft launch stand - off missiles against @entity50 targets and just as they used to do in the @entity113 they are practising those profiles			0
' they are testing us , they are testing our defences , they are testing our reactions and they are engaging to a degree in a game of chicken and that 's very dangerous			0
' so we are seeing the possibility of mid-air collision , not between @entity7 and @entity39 aircraft , but between @entity9 aircraft and civilian aircraft increasing			1
' official figures show that @entity7 jets have been scrambled to deter @entity9 plans 88 times from 2005 to 2014 , including 8 times last year			2
a third of all incidents in which @entity7 pilots were deployed involved a plan from @entity39			2
footage of @entity3 and @entity172 fighter jets escorting a @entity9 bomber were released by a @entity1 - backed tv station earlier this week			1
the video was filmed from the window of one of the huge @entity113 - era @entity280 planes			0
prime minister @entity222 defiantly dismissed the incident , saying the @entity39 ' are trying to make some sort of a point , and i do n't think we should dignify it with too much of a response '			0
he added : ' i think what this episode demonstrates is that we do have the fast jets , the pilots , the systems in place to protect the @entity3			0

military chief @entity13 says flights will continue throughout 2015
@entity9 military will routinely test the ' capacity ' of their planes
@entity355 ' training ' is part of @entity39 's plan for ' strategic deterrence '
@entity9 @entity161 have flown close to @entity3 airspace twice in recent weeks
comes days after warning of mid-air collision fears with *commercial* jets
@entity45 branded a ' real and present danger ' by @entity3 defence secretary
