by @entity0 in @entity1 @entity2 : 19:05 est , 28 december 2013 @entity3 : 20:25 est , 28 december 2013 @entity4 has joined @entity5 and says she ’s accepted @entity7 's family thinks she 's guilty as the end of her murder retrial approaches			1
@entity10 tweeted a link to her blog : ‘ with respect to the @entity26 ’ on december 18 , in which she writes : ' i hope that everyone can understand that this is an issue of perspective , and from mine and those who know my innocence , it ’s clear that my actions are an attempt to show compassion and solidarity			2
' i have to accept that the @entity27 believe i ’m guilty and my attempts to honor her memory can cause them pain			0
i do not wish to antagonize their grief , even with my best intentions			0
' moving on : @entity10 , 26 , said that ' common sense ' told her not to return to @entity37 for her trial in the murder of @entity41 student @entity7 the 26 - year - old is currently being retried for @entity7 ’s murder in @entity44 , @entity37 , but is not attending the trial			1
it appears her outburst was triggered by being told to remove a link to the @entity50 family fundraising page from her website www.amandaknox.com			1
the blog entry goes on to describe her pain at being asked to remove the link by the family ’s @entity57 writes : “ it is with a broken heart that i acquiesce with the @entity50 family ’s attorney ’s request to remove from my site the link to the @entity50 family ’s fundraising page and the page i have dedicated in memory of my friend , @entity7			1
' i feel trapped in a position where any attempts i make to respect their grief from a distance are perceived as indifference , and any attempts to make a connection are perceived as antagonism and arrogance			0
' thank you to all who have supported me in wanting to keep @entity7 ’s memory as a friend alive in my heart			2
' retried : in the midst of her retrial in @entity37 , @entity4 has launched a @entity5 page in closing arguments last week the @entity50 family lawyer @entity89 urged the panel of two professional judges and eight lay jurors to disregard @entity10 's claims of innocence			1
he said : ' she has become a well - known person			0
you know she signed contracts for millions of dollars for her book			0
she has someone who takes care of her public relations			0
' she has a personal website where she invites people to collect donations in the memory of the victim , @entity7 , which is an unbearable contradiction for the family			2
' he added that the world 's attention has focused on @entity10 , while ' the victim has fallen into total oblivion , to the immense pain of the @entity50 family '			1
@entity4 had previously hit back at @entity89 's claims as inaccurate			2
on december 17 , she tweeted : ‘ @entity50 ’s family , ’ and a link to another blog entry in which she wrote : ' the @entity50 family ’s civil attorney , @entity89 , in his closing arguments yesterday , claimed i have been collecting unspecified funds in the name of @entity7 and her @entity124 implied that i was deceiving the public and collecting those funds for myself			1
' please visit the @entity129 page and scroll down to the @entity131 section to discover that i have simply added a link to the @entity50 family ’s own website where they solicit donations for their ongoing struggle through this heartbreaking legal process			1
' i have been solicited by mr @entity89 to remove from my site anything i have done to honor her memory or show support to her family			2
my response was that no one but the @entity50 family has any right to make such a request			2
as i await direct contact from the family of my murdered friend , i will continue to honor her and show support			0
thank you for your support			0
' @entity10 returned home to @entity156 on october 4 , 2011 , after four years in jail for the murder of @entity7 @entity10 has a section of her website called : ‘ @entity129 ’ , but there is no longer a ‘ @entity163 ’ , so it appears she has now removed it			1
however - in a move that some may find distasteful - next to @entity10 ’s blog entries about @entity7 is an icon with credit card symbols in which she asks for donations for her own @entity173			1
@entity10 joined @entity5 on november 14 as @ amamaknox , tweeting : ' # ryanfergusonwelcome home ! ! ! with love and support , @entity4 and @entity178			1
' she also posted a photo of herself with best friend @entity180 , who moved to @entity37 to support her when she was in prison , holding up a sign saying ‘ welcome home @entity183			0
' @entity185 spent 10 years in prison wrongly convicted of second - degree murder and first degree robbery and was released last month after it was finally overturned			0
@entity10 has only tweeted 14 times and at the time of writing had just 97 followers – one of which is her co-accused @entity196 who has been on @entity5 for since november 2011			1
on her @entity5 page she also has the @entity200 quote : ' @entity201 , ' a quote from ancient @entity204 poet @entity203 meaning : ' remember to maintain a calm mind while doing difficult tasks			2
' @entity10 sent an email to the @entity44 courtroom pleading her innocence last week in a move which appeared not to impress the judge			0
judge @entity214 said such an email from a defendant was ‘ irregular ’ , adding : ‘ if you want to speak to the trial you have to come to the trial			0
' the trial is expected to conclude in mid-january .			0

@entity4 has linked to @entity7 's family 's fundraising page on her blog and @entity5 account
the family 's lawyer asked her to remove the links
