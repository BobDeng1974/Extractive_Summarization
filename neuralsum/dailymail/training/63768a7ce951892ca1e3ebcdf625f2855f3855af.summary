' before killing his fifth victim , 41 - year - old @entity121 on june 12 , @entity13 called police four times to ask why they had not linked the four murders , telling them he had killed them all			2
' i set out to see , because i read a lot of books on serial killers and indeed , you know , i wondered if it could possibly be done and actually got away with it , ' he said			2
asked why he targeted homosexuals , he told officers they ' keep their mouths shut and do n't tell the police things '			0
