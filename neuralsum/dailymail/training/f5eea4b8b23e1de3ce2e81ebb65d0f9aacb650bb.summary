by @entity0 @entity2 's first wild beaver for 500 years has been caught on camera for a second time - but this time gnawing on a tree in the dead of night			1
the mammal was first photographed in july last year , but evidence of the its living habits have since been scant			0
the rare creatures were thought to have been hunted to extinction in the wild , but a retired scientist has used an infrared camera to photograph a beaver living locally			1
these images , as well as the new shots of the beaver family , were all captured by retired scientist @entity24 beavers normally live in family groups and can survive up to 24 years in the wild and 35 years in captivity			1
they are herbivorous rodents that build corridors in their dams to escape predators such as wolves and bears in the wild			0
the animals are nocturnal and can grow to more than 3ft , weigh up to 70lbs , and feed on a diet of reeds , leaves and bark			0
beavers were hunted almost to extinction in @entity44 , both for fur and for castoreum - a secretion of its scent gland for medicinal properties			1
the animal is pictured in a sequence of shots sinking its teeth into a tree trunk beside the @entity55 , in @entity56 , near @entity57 , @entity58 , where locals recently reported sightings of a beaver			1
beavers were once native to @entity62 but were hunted to extinction during the reign of @entity64 in the 16th century			1
conservationists have introduced several small groups of beavers back into captivity in the @entity2 , but this is thought to be the first one found living in the wild			2
retired environmental scientist @entity24 set up his specialist photographic equipment after several sightings of the creature on the banks of the @entity55 , which flows through @entity76 and @entity58			1
he used a trail camera - which automatically takes photos when it detects signs of movement - and positioned it at several points around a small island owned by local farmer @entity83 , after spotting evidence of bite marks on trees			1
when he checked his camera he was delighted to have caught the nocturnal beaver on film , chewing wedges out of the base of a tree in a bid to topple it			2
conservationists have introduced several small groups of beavers back into captivity in the @entity2 , but this is thought to be the first one found living in the wild			2
here the animal gnaws on a tree the animals were pictured in a sequence of shots taken beside the @entity55 , in @entity56 , near @entity57 , @entity58 , pictured mr @entity24 said : ‘ i first noticed a tree that had been damaged because i walk around that area every day - then i saw a few trees had been nibbled			1
‘ for me it posed the question : could it have been a beaver , or was it some kids messing about ? ‘ when i looked more closely it was clear the damage to the trees had been done by a beaver			2
’ he explained that the island where he set up his equipment is at the point where the river divides , which might be the ideal location for a dam			0
mr @entity24 said : ‘ it 's where most of the trees have been laid down , not necessarily forming a dam , but it may be that this is the early stages			1
’ during recent years beavers have been reintroduced in captive areas as part of breeding programs including at @entity56 and @entity130 - but none are unaccounted for			2
here , a beaver gnaws on wood in captivity @entity24 used a trail camera - which automatically takes photos when it detects signs of movement - and positioned it at several points around a small island near the river , after spotting evidence of bite marks on trees			1
this image is one of the results last july a wild beaver was spotted in the @entity150 otter near @entity151 , @entity58			1
it was sighted by @entity153 , 35 who was walking her dog at the time			0
she said it seemed calm and swam in circles before returning to cover beneath a tree			0
she photographed the animal chewing on bark and dragging pieces of wood through the shallow water			2
the beaver caught on camera is believed to be the same one spotted in july by @entity153 , 35 , while she was walking her dog			2
she saw the animal relaxing in the water 13 miles upstream in the same river and mr @entity24 believes the evidence that there is a wild beaver living in the area is irrefutable			1
‘ the only time i 've seen the beaver in the flesh was around christmas time when i saw its nose while it was in the water , ’ he said			0
‘ every time i 've spotted it on the camera it 's been in the pitch dark			0
it chews on trees and gathers branches together			0
@entity153 spied a wild beaver in the @entity55 last july			1
the animal is believed to be the same one sighted by mr @entity189 and the first of its kind spotted in @entity62 since they became extinct around 500 years ago the retired scientist first noticed a tree that had been damaged from nibbling , which made him want to get photographic evidence of the beaver 's @entity197 photo documents the damage done by the wild beaver the @entity200 said that the last few @entity2 beavers were hunted to extinction in @entity203 during the 16th century			1
to return the creatures to the @entity2 , conservationists have reintroduced them by using close relatives from @entity207			0
between may 2009 and september 2010 , the @entity208 released four family groups and one pair of beavers into @entity212 , @entity213			0
more recently , beavers have been reintroduced in captive areas as part of breeding programs including at @entity56 and @entity130 - but none are unaccounted for			2
‘ most of the sightings , if not all , have been when it comes out of the water and onto the land			0
the question now is if it 's just one , or is it a pair			0
‘ it may be one that 's just passing through from somewhere else - it might be an escapee , but nobody seems to be saying they 've lost a beaver			0
’ mr @entity83 said he suspected people were messing around with axes when he first saw that a couple of trees had been felled last summer			0
‘ we have n't seen the real animal yet , only the one in mr @entity24 's photographs			2
but you can see the " artwork " he does to the trees all around the area , ’ the farmer said			0
‘ it 's early days yet but , as long as lots of people do n't go there and frighten the beaver away , he should be happy enough			0
the island where mr @entity24 set up his equipment is at the point where the river divides , which might be the ideal location for a dam			0
here , farmer @entity83 ( pictured ) looks at the animal 's habitat on the @entity55 in east @entity58 ‘ what 's going to be really interesting is how it gets on with the other animals , like the otters which we see on the river			1
’ the @entity200 says that the last few @entity2 beavers became extinct in @entity203 during the 16th century			1
during recent years they have been reintroduced in captive areas as part of breeding programs including at @entity56 and @entity130 - but none are unaccounted for			0
in @entity56 the breeding pair built a dam and had two kits and by 2005 and in october 2008 three escaped from their home in @entity270 , @entity58 , but were all re-caught .			1
