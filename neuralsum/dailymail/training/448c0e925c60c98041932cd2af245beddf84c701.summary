@entity0 scored @entity2 's opener - click here for that and more from our @entity5 like all great managers , @entity7 is at his best when being written off and bombarded with advice from supporters who should know better			1
the call from @entity2 fans for the manager to sling out @entity0 had reached fever pitch in the build - up to saturday 's match at @entity17			1
so what did @entity7 do ? he ignored popular opinion , made @entity0 the focal point of his team and relegated midfielder @entity22 and the popular striker @entity23 to the bench			1
@entity0 evades @entity25 to latch on to @entity27 's pass and score @entity2 's opening goal against @entity29 @entity27 adds to @entity2 's lead a minute later , tapping the ball past @entity29 goalkeeper @entity32 from close range for his first @entity35 goal @entity36 ( left ) scores an own goal to make it 3 - 0 to @entity2 in the space of four minutes @entity29 4 - 3 - 3 : @entity32 6 ; @entity40 6.5 , @entity25 6 , @entity41 6 , @entity36 6 ; @entity42 6.5 , @entity23 6 ( @entity43 86min ) , @entity44 7 ; @entity45 6 ( @entity46 46 , 6 ) , @entity47 6.5 , @entity48 6 ( @entity49 77 ) booked : @entity41 subs not used : given , @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53			1
manager : @entity55 6 @entity2 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 : @entity56 7 ; @entity57 6.5 , mertesacker 7 , @entity58 7 , @entity59 7 ; @entity60 6.5 , @entity61 7 ( @entity22 78 ) ; @entity62 7 ( @entity63 78 ) , @entity0 8 , @entity64 7 ; @entity27 7.5 ( @entity65 78 ) booked : @entity57 , @entity61 , @entity22 subs not used : @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity23 , @entity69 manager : @entity7 7			1
man of the match : @entity0			1
referee : @entity74 6 attendance : 40,013 then he sat back and watched @entity0 and deadline - day signing @entity27 tear @entity29 to shreds with three goals in the space of little more than three minutes			1
@entity7 admitted that dropping his £ 42million record buy from @entity82 — pilloried for his poor showing in tuesday ’s @entity85 defeat against @entity86 — might destroy his fragile confidence			0
instead , he moved the 25 - year - old into a central position where he could affect play — and @entity0 did not let him down with a goal and assist			1
‘ i did n’t really consider leaving out @entity0 , ’ said @entity7			1
‘ i have a lot of attacking players and you are always looking to find the right balance			0
@entity23 for example has played every game and i felt he needed a rest			0
‘ i wanted @entity0 to play behind their midfield			1
it was important for him to find space between the lines and it worked			0
‘ i felt we were at the point where i had to show confidence in him			2
you never know how people respond to being left out			0
it ’s a sensitive point			0
’ improbable as it sounds , @entity55 ’s men could have gone top of the table with a victory here , with the only team above them at kick - off , @entity120 , playing @entity121 on sunday			0
but @entity29 ’s chances were dealt a cruel blow following a training ground virus which cost them @entity126 and @entity127 in the morning , @entity128 in the pre-match kickabout and @entity45 at half - time			1
even at full strength , @entity29 would have been hard - pressed to stop @entity0 in this mood , as he belatedly showed everyone why he has just won a @entity134			1
the @entity135 does not like the rough stuff but , in terms of talent and composure on the ball , he is up there with the best , as his opening goal in the 33rd minute showed			1
when @entity27 found @entity0 on the edge of the box , two shaven - headed @entity29 players hurtled towards him ; goalkeeper @entity32 off his line and defender @entity25 from the side			1
@entity29 captain @entity47 hurdles a challenge from @entity150 in the opening minutes at @entity17 @entity27 ( centre ) produces an acrobatic effort on goal as @entity29 defenders @entity40 ( right ) and @entity155 to block the ball @entity0 sets himself and holds off @entity25 to slot his first goal of the season past @entity32 @entity0 looks like he means business as he celebrates his opening goal for @entity2 @entity0 ( right ) is congratulated by team - mates @entity27 ( second right ) , @entity59 ( second left ) and @entity61 @entity0 's heat map after he played the ' no 10 ' role showed he played all across the pitch just behind the striker ... for more go to our brilliant @entity5 mins @entity167 @entity29 total 107.9 67.0 @entity42 90 11.5 7.1 @entity44 90 11.0 6.9 @entity168 90 10.7 6.7 @entity2 total 110.0 68.4 @entity0 90 11.3 7.0 @entity64 90 11.2 7.0 @entity60 90 11.0 6.8 data courtesy of the @entity170 , the @entity171 of the @entity172 the completely unflustered no 10 simply looked up and stroked a left - foot finish underneath @entity32 ’s arm with the nonchalance of someone nipping out to get a pint of milk at the corner shop			1
a minute later , @entity0 turned provider for @entity27 to net his first @entity2 goal			1
as @entity7 pointed out , it was almost a carbon copy of the striker ’s close - range effort for @entity186 against @entity187			0
this time , @entity0 played the @entity189 role with a whipped - in cross from the left			1
@entity27 ran into the six - yard box like a good centre forward and finished with one touch into the roof of the net			1
the only difference this time was that he made a good connection with the ball rather than the shinned version in @entity202			0
@entity7 said : ‘ knowing how people look to see how long it takes a new signing to score , i ’m glad he did it now ! ‘ he was able to score it because of the timing of his run			0
it was a good all - round performance			2
’ @entity211 were shellshocked and rueing two early saves made by @entity56 from @entity44 and @entity41 while the score was 0 - 0			0
poor @entity36 tried to stop @entity62 from getting on the end of a @entity59 cross and succeeding only in turning the ball into his own net			2
three goals in 192 seconds and the contest was all but over			0
the second half was akin to a training ground exercise , with @entity29 not wanting to be slaughtered and @entity2 saving themselves for bigger challenges ahead			1
@entity27 takes the congratulations from @entity57 ( centre ) , @entity64 ( left ) and @entity61 ( right , partly obscured ) after his goal a view from behind as @entity27 steers home @entity2 's second from close range via @entity32 's face @entity29 manager @entity55 will close the club ’s @entity233 training ground for 48 hours after a virus outbreak wrecked preparations for saturday 's match			1
@entity127 , @entity126 and @entity128 were ruled out beforehand — with @entity128 being replaced minutes before kick – off by @entity168			0
@entity45 was also ill at half - time and replaced by @entity240 , while goalkeeper @entity32 and @entity44 played despite struggling			2
@entity55 said : ‘ i do n’t feel 100 per cent either			0
i ’ll shut the training ground for a day or two to try and eradicate it			0
’ ‘ it was a response we needed after tuesday , ’ said @entity7 , whose side are still unbeaten in the @entity172 this season			0
‘ @entity29 started well but after that we were in control			2
we scored three and it was a possession game after that			0
’ @entity29 ’s tally of two shots on target actually upped their average for the season — their early success has been based on clean sheets			2
@entity55 cited medical problems as a reason why his team did not have more of a go at @entity2 in the second half			2
‘ the players were running on empty , ’ he said			0
‘ against a team like @entity2 , you can get beaten by six if you ’re not careful			2
we had to keep confidence intact			0
’ @entity29 will close their training ground this week to try and stop the virus spreading and @entity55 is keen this heavy defeat does not dent morale after what had been a promising start to the season			2
‘ we had so much bad luck with all the players and staff having the bug , ’ he said			0
‘ we were n’t the best prepared and we have to look back on a tally of 10 points from our first five games , which is good			0
’ then , without a hint of irony , @entity55 said about the defeat : ‘ we have to take our medicine			0
’ @entity7 has not been beaten at @entity17 for 15 years and he will spend the week mulling over where @entity0 should fit in next			2
‘ he can play anywhere , ’ said the @entity2 manager			2
‘ he likes to be central but you can find 10 players in my squad who like to play in the middle ! ’ @entity27 scored his first goal for @entity2 from close range after a nice move down the left ... for more go to our brilliant @entity5 @entity59 ( right ) fires in the shot which led to @entity36 's own goal and @entity2 's third @entity25 ( centre ) tries to encourage @entity29 's shell - shocked players after @entity36 's own goal made it 3 - 0 @entity29 midfielder @entity168 puts in a hefty challenge on @entity27 as the hosts look to stem the tide @entity44 takes the ball past @entity186 colleague @entity62 in the midfield @entity62 runs at @entity36 on a torrid afternoon for the @entity29 left back , who was taken off at half - time @entity57 ( right ) wins a header against @entity41 ( second right ) as @entity2 clear a dead ball @entity61 and @entity42 vie for the ball during a more keenly - contested second half @entity61 contraols the ball in midfield with @entity2 in a comfortable position at @entity17 @entity317 cuts a menacing figure with his foot on the ball as @entity57 looks to get the game restarted quickly @entity7 is given a pre-match hug by @entity29 's mascot and it seems the hosts ' players were equally generous			1

@entity0 stole the show as he scored and claimed an assist against @entity29
@entity135 *playmaker* @entity0 set up @entity27 60 seconds after scoring past @entity32
@entity36 scored an own goal to round off the scoring for @entity2
@entity29 had to make several changes *due* to an illness which has hit their camp
