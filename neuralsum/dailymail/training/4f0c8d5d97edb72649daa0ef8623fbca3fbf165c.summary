former president @entity0 said on friday that he was baffled by a @entity3 grand jury 's decision not to indict a police officer who put @entity5 into a chokehold			1
' i thought how sad			1
the verdict was hard to understand , ' @entity0 told @entity10 's @entity9 in a clip on an interview the network plans to air during @entity9 's show on sunday , adding that he ' had n't seen all the details			1
' ' but it ’s sad that race continues to play such ...			1
an emotional , divisive part of life , ' he continued , reflecting on the race riots he witnessed growing up in the 1970s			1
' i do think we 've improved			1
an emotional , divisive part of life , ' former president @entity0 told @entity10 host @entity9 in an interview aired in part today by the network in the segment of the interview that was released , @entity0 did not weigh in on whether the @entity34 should proceed with a civil rights investigation into the killing nor did he list particular reforms that federal and enforcement officials should purse in order to prevent similar deaths			1
he did relay a conversation that he and his former secretary of state , @entity44 , had over dinner after a grand jury declined to indict former @entity48 , @entity49 , police officer @entity47 for taking the life of @entity51			1
' we talked about this subject , and ... she just said , " you ’ve got to understand that there are a lot of black folks around that are incredibly more and more distrusting of law enforcement			2
" ' which is a shame , because law enforcement ’s job is to protect everybody , ' he said			2
president @entity65 and the @entity66 have been careful not to publicly comment on either of the grand jury decisions or potential federal actions , noting that it would be inappropriate for them to influence or interfere with @entity72 's probe			2
instead , the president has spoken more vaguely about the effect that the court decisions had on minority communities , pointing out that ' too many ' feel that ' law enforcement is not working with them and dealing with them in a fair way			0
' ' we are not going to let up until we see a strengthening of trust and strengthening of accountability that exists between our communities and our law enforcement , ' he said after the verdict was announced on wednesday			0
black members of @entity90 said on thursday that the @entity66 could show its support for the @entity94 - @entity93 community by inviting the families of @entity51 and @entity5 to the president 's annual @entity96 address next month , ' those families are symbols of an issue that needs to be urgently addressed in @entity93 , ' @entity99 rep. @entity98 told @entity103			1
' i think it would be an excellent idea			0
' ' it would be good that we put a face to the injustices that have occurred as a result of the criminal justice system that has n't been lifted to a point of colorblindness , ' @entity3 rep. @entity107 said			0
at least one @entity116 in @entity90 , @entity3 rep. @entity117 , has come out swinging in favor of the white law enforcement officers in @entity3 , saying , that had @entity5 not ' had asthma and a heart condition and was so obese , almost definitely he would not have died ' and that ' there ’s not a hint there that anyone used any racial epithet			2
' @entity117 said he has ' no doubt ' that a ' 350 pound white guy ' would have faced the same treatment at the hands of police			0
a protester , demanding justice for @entity5 , holds a placard featuring @entity5 's final words while staging a ' die - in ' with dozens of others in downtown @entity139 , @entity3 today			1
protesters swarmed streets of @entity142 or a second night on thursday to denounce a grand jury 's decision to spare a white police officer from criminal prosecution in the choking death of the unarmed black man @entity149 and likely 2016 contestant @entity150 said wednesday that he blames the politicians who created the laws that led to what happened			2
@entity5 was first approached by police because he was hawking untaxed cigarettes on the street in @entity157 , which is illegal			0
' obviously , the individual circumstances are important , but i think it ’s also important to know that some politician put a tax of $ 5.85 on a pack of cigarettes , so they ’ve driven cigarettes underground by making them so expensive , ' @entity150 told hardball host @entity165			1
' but then some politician also had to direct the police to say , " hey , we want you arresting people for selling a loose cigarette			0
@entity150 said ' there really is no excuse for ' anyone to die for breaking that type of law , and added , ' but i do blame the politicians			0
we put our police in a difficult situation with bad laws			0
' other republicans on @entity182 have mostly been quiet about the death this week , however , preferring to gripe instead about the president 's executive actions on immigration			0
@entity116 conference chair @entity187 said yesterday , however , that she ' absolutely ' believes that @entity90 should hearings on @entity5 's death			0
house speaker @entity191 did n't directly endorse hearings at a press conference on thursday , telling reporters , ' i ’m not going to rule that in or out , ' but the @entity116 leader acknowledged that he does think ' that the @entity93 people deserve answers about what really happened here			0

' it ’s sad that race continues to play such ... . an emotional , divisive part of life , ' @entity0 said reflecting on the race riots he witnessed growing up
speaking generally about race relations , @entity0 told @entity10 's @entity9 : ' i do think we 've improved '
@entity10 aired the first part of the interview with @entity0 today and saved the rest for @entity9 's show on sunday *morning*
