' cannabis is decriminalised in almost 20 states - but only for possession or medical use , and in some it can still be a small - scale violation			1
the drink will only be sold in markets where selling cannabis is fully legal , including for recreational use			1
these are : @entity14 small amounts were legalised for over- 21s in 2012 , but regulatory delays meant the first licences were only granted in march this year			1

' it was n't simple			0
we 're still using two strains of it , then there 's the dynamic of how it plays with the caffeine			0
' mr @entity84 added : ' we do n't want to pack so much thc into every one of our drinks that it 's unpleasant , especially for people that are just getting into marijuana			1
