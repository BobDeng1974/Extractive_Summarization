by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 17:01 est , 11 january 2014 updated : 05:10 est , 12 january 2014 seedy : the @entity4 poses in a photograph he posted on his @entity7 page disgraced former @entity9 boss @entity8 has resumed his depraved lifestyle of drugs and rent boys , despite facing fresh scrutiny by police and @entity16 regulators			1
although he promised to seek help , the @entity18 minister is still using the horse tranquilliser drug ketamine and booking male prostitutes			1
the new revelations come two months after @entity23 first exposed the @entity25 chairman apparently buying cocaine and crystal meth			1
he was filmed counting out banknotes , allegedly to buy the drugs			1
yet as he faces new probes into his behaviour , little has changed in the sex - and drug - fuelled world of the 63 - year - old methodist minister			1
@entity4 is due to be reinterviewed by detectives this week , as two @entity16 regulators plan separate investigations into his professional conduct at the time the @entity9 was brought to its knees			2
yet despite the renewed scrutiny			2
only last wednesday he asked a rent boy to visit and promised in a taped telephone call : ‘ i will have @entity45 [ ketamine ] but that ’s all			2
you get what you want			2
’ @entity4 had told friends that he spent four weeks in rehab before returning to his home on @entity53			2
but it was n’t long before he was back to his old ways			1
on @entity56 , he emailed an escort with the words : ‘ hi – happy new year ! ! you ok ? meet sometime ? @entity60 ’ the escort was a £ 400 - a - night rent boy 40 years his junior who @entity63 had met only once before , during an all - night drug - fuelled orgy at his @entity67 - owned house in @entity68 last october			1
when the younger man jokingly called him ‘ @entity70 ’ , @entity4 replied : ‘ gramps ! ! ! i ’ll f * * * you so hard for that ! ! ! ! ! ’			2
and as they try to arrange a time and place to meet , the former bank boss ’s holiday diary proved packed : ‘ today [ thursday january 2 ] i am seeing @entity78			1
tomorrow i have to meet a friend at 11pm who ’s coming back from @entity81 – to bring him over here for a couple of days			1
’ the ‘ friend ’ who @entity4 took back to his house last weekend is a known ketamine user and the same man with whom he spoke of spending ‘ 12 hours in a ket hole ’ in a text message on november 13			1
back to his old tricks : flowers at the drug user 's house slinking off : the @entity18 minister drives off after visiting his ' friend ' in @entity97 late on january 3 the @entity23 watched as the shamed minister arrived at the man ’s house in the run - down @entity102 area of @entity97 just before 11pm on friday january 3 and drove him back to his @entity68 home			1
the following monday , he headed to @entity97 again , this time to go house - hunting			2
and on tuesday , he aborted a plan to see the escort he had been emailing but rang him in the early hours of wednesday to make new arrangements			1
‘ maybe you could come over tomorrow night later in the evening , ’ he asked			2
at one point in the conversation , @entity4 shows a distinct lack of concern when he hears the 23 - year - old had overdosed on date - rape drug @entity115 [ ‘ g ’ ]			1
the rent - boy tells him ‘ i had a bit to much g last night			2
[ a friend ] had to ring an ambulance			1
getting that blood gas thing is the worst ever			0
’ flowers asks : ‘ how long were you in ? ’ and after being told about five and a half hours , shows no surprise or alarm and goes on to discuss how he got some ‘ good press ’ that day over a @entity128 hearing			0
when the escort told him he wanted to bring a friend along , @entity4 grumpily replied : ‘ how much have i got to pay for that , for @entity134 ’s sake ? ’ told it would be the ‘ same as last time ’ , @entity4 ’ admitted he could n’t remember what he paid before			1
he then attempted to negotiate down from £ 800 , muttering : ‘ that ’s a lot of money ’ before being told : ‘ if that price is too high , we ’ll sort something out			0
’ later @entity4 emailed over his concern that he did n’t want the other escort to be ‘ off his trolley like last time ’			0
flowers was told : ‘ yeah , that ’s fine , he wo n’t have ket , ’ but three hours later , as they made their final preparations for the night , @entity4 said : ‘ i will have @entity45 but that ’s all			0
you get what you want			0
’ on tuesday , @entity4 is due to answer police bail in @entity154 over alleged conspiracy to supply class a drugs			1
then he may discover whether he will face criminal charges			0
and last week the financial industry ’s two main watchdogs announced they would be holding their own inquiries into goings on at the bank			1
the @entity163 , an arm of the @entity165 , and the @entity166 will both hold investigations into whether there was any failure or wrongdoing at @entity9			0
a @entity16 source said it was ‘ unthinkable ’ that @entity4 would not be called to testify , although neither regulator would comment on their inquiries			1
in november , chancellor @entity175 announced a broad independent inquiry into the whole @entity9 affair			0
but that investigation will now have to wait until the two @entity16 watchdogs have completed their own probes , which are set to take several months			0
labour leader @entity181 was drawn into the affair as he had held a private meeting with flowers in march 2013 , a month before his bank lent @entity185 £ 1.2 million			0
@entity4 and @entity181 had two other informal dinners and three other meetings			0
shadow chancellor @entity189 ’ office was also given a £ 50,000 donation from the @entity191 , but mr @entity189 insisted he had never had any direct contact with @entity4			0
last week , the @entity193 heard about the events leading up to the @entity196 ’s collapse			1
at that session , @entity197 , the man who appointed flowers as chairman in 2010 , stood by his decision in the face of outrage and incredulity from @entity205			0
mr @entity207 ’s intransigence before the @entity205 delighted @entity63			0
‘ i ’m fine , ’ he said in a phone call to the escort the next day , which the @entity211 has heard			1
‘ coping all right at the moment			0
i actually had some good press today so it was all right for a change			0
some people were saying nice things about me in newspapers and on the @entity217			0
’ however , committee chairman @entity218 branded @entity4 a ‘ financial illiterate ’ following his embarrassing appearance before them last october when he put the co-op ’s assets at £ 3 billion when the correct answer was £ 47 billion			1
@entity226 meth shame : how the @entity23 broke the original story in november the news of @entity63 ’ on - going depravity is sure to disappoint those who have tried to help him conquer his apparent addiction to hard drugs			1
when our story broke last november he issued a contrite apology admitting : ‘ i did things that were stupid and wrong			0
i am sorry for this and i am seeking professional help			0
’ the following week , as his @entity242 employers offered their support while also suspending him from his parish duties , he was caught telling a drug dealer to , ‘ bring the boy @entity246 ’ as he arranged a rendezvous			2
a spokeswoman for the @entity67 said she had no knowledge of the @entity67 paying for @entity250 to go into drugs rehab			2
she added : ‘ he is still an office holder in the church and we will investigate thoroughly once any criminal processes have finished			0
’ the @entity9 almost collapsed last year due to a £ 1.5 billion shortfall in its capital reserves			0
@entity4 ’ solicitor @entity258 did not respond to @entity23 ’s request for comments on the new developments last night .			0

exposed by @entity211 for using drugs and blamed for near collapse of co-op
