by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity2 is hoping to pop open the champagne on the most - coveted podium in @entity5 as he makes a landmark 100th @entity6 start with @entity7 this weekend			1
in 99 previous races with the @entity10 - based team , @entity2 has so far notched up 38 victories and four world titles			1
however , win no 39 will perhaps require something special to happen			2
certainly @entity7 suggested they are closer to the dominant @entity15 duo of @entity16 and @entity17 following the opening practice sessions in @entity19 on thursday			1
eyes on the prize : @entity2 is hoping for victory no 39 with @entity7 in @entity19 this weekend with power less of a requirement - and @entity15 have shown they have that in abundance - and high down force instead the key ingredient , @entity7 may yet draw closer to @entity28 and @entity17			1
the duo still lead the way , separated themselves by just 0.032secs , with @entity2 's team - mate @entity33 just over two tenths of a second adrift after the opening 90 - minute session			2
rain affected @entity36 in which @entity39 's @entity38 was quickest , albeit two tenths of a second down on @entity16 's time from @entity43 as the circuit finally dried and came alive in the dying minutes			0
@entity2 ultimately finished third , just over half a second back in a car in which he now feels far more comfortable			2
although @entity2 knows @entity15 remain the team to beat , he has not given up hope of finally ending their run of five successive wins and four consecutive one - twos			1
run out : @entity2 was fifth quickest on thursday 's opening practice session ' @entity15 were very quick in morning and we see that usually , come saturday , they are able to pick up their pace , so we 'll try to do the same , ' said @entity2			1
' potentially we are a little closer here , but you know at the moment it 's all guessing			0
' the big advantage on this track would be that there 's not that many straights , but we have to wait and see			0
' we were obviously limited on what we could learn in terms of pace and range			0
' we know it 's quite important to qualify in the front here , so if there is a chance then we have to use it			0
' fastest run : @entity16 ended thursday 's first session marginally faster than @entity17 as far as @entity2 's career goes , now in his sixth year with @entity7 , he concedes the time has flown by , and ' it has been more successful and better than we ever expected '			1
looking back at his 99 races with @entity7 , @entity2 added : ' in 2009 it was a surprise to have a really competitive car			1
' in my first year ( with the team ) i made mistakes i had to do , as did the team , but it was part of the process of growing together			2
' it was very painful to get beaten in the fight for the championship , but after that it has been quite phenomenal			0
' it was something that was impossible to expect and very difficult to target because there were so many things that could have happened			0
' as to when he will taste success again , however , he said : ' this year looks a bit different to previous years			2
' but then again we 're only five races in , we know the team is strong , and we have been through a lot in our 99 races together			0
' i am confident we will get stronger , but the question is how soon			0
