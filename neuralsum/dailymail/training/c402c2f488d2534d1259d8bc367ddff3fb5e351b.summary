by @entity0 last updated at 4:00 pm on 25th september 2011 @entity1 benefited from a special relationship with @entity4 delegates whilst the ongoing conflict in @entity7 continues in a bid to reclaim the entire @entity10 country from ousted @entity11 , new evidence has been uncovered detailing the special ' privileges ' @entity4 bestowed on the former leader 's deceased son captain @entity13			1
in documents uncovered by the @entity18 , the clear courting of @entity16 includes @entity20 training for his regiment , courses at @entity24 and taxpayer - funded invitations to @entity4 events including accommodation in five - star @entity29 hotels			1
@entity1 was @entity11 's fifth son , who having graduated from the @entity31 in 2002 , then spent an additional year in @entity32 at the @entity33			1
having returned to his homeland , he established the @entity35 , that were given an insight into @entity4 operations when 50 @entity7 including members of @entity1 ' squad were given @entity20 training in counter-terrorism , weapons and field craft			1
this knowledge was later used by the @entity35 to a devastating effect during their retaliation for the uprising against his father			2
when the conflict reached @entity53 in august , @entity51 clashed with rebel forces and carried out a brutal execution of a reported 45 prisioners at a warehouse			1
escapee , @entity58 told of the horror			2
he said : ' four soldiers climbed on the top of the warehouse , and another soldier opened the door			2
they started shooting at us ' the guy at the door was throwing in grenades			2
after i escaped , i saw one of the soldiers finish off anyone who was wounded			2
' it was widely accepted that @entity11 's 10,000 unit was better equipped than the country 's army but their overriding responsibility was for the safety and welfare of the entire family			1
a @entity7 man covers his face with the charred skeletons of some 50 people found in a makeshift prison following an execution carried out by @entity1 ' troops following the completion of the deal in principle to release the @entity93 bomber , @entity92 , @entity1 ' unit signed a Â£ 85 million agreement with @entity95 @entity4 in 2007			0
this provided the @entity7 with a similar command and control system to that used by the @entity100			0
and with the relationship blossoming , clearance in 2009 allowed for 50 @entity7 troops from the @entity35 to undergo @entity20 training			0
a fighter from @entity7 's ruling @entity106 fires an @entity108 rocket at @entity110 forces anti-gaddafi fighters fire a heavy artillery piece near @entity113 documents dating back to 2008 , addressed , ' restricted - @entity4 / @entity7 eyes only , ' reveal that whilst the @entity20 course was ' regrettably ' inaccessible for foreign parties , just months later , the permission to educate @entity1 ' men was given			1
former commanding officer to @entity121 , @entity122 , defended the education received by the @entity35 insisting : ' there was no need for the @entity126 not to be involved with @entity7 at the time , as it was felt that it was better to have them inside the tent rather than outside			0
' in letters from @entity1 ' elder brother @entity132 , enquiring into the training , it reveals the difficult ' selection ' course endured by the @entity7 during their stay at the training base			0
@entity122 reinforced this belief by adding that the soliders ' were no up to it ' following their special programme			0
however relations between both @entity4 and @entity7 parties began to deteriorate following a request from the @entity144 to name all the overseas delegates , which was rejected by @entity7 officials			0
@entity7 rebel fighters celebrate as they drive through @entity53 near to where @entity1 was later reportedly killed a letter sent by @entity153 representative , @entity150 pleaded with the @entity7 for reasons behind their denial of the names			1
he wrote : ' if you are not content , i would ask that you provide me with a formal statement with the reasons , as this will help strengthen the case against release			0
' @entity1 and his aides believed the release would severely threaten his ability to conduct future deals as the conflict in the @entity169 country spiralled			0
having fled @entity53 , he is alleged to have been killed during a rebel ambush south of the capital			1
however , the same @entity4 troops that once assisted him and his fellow compatriots were now fighting against him in a bid to end his father 's last remaining foothold on the @entity169 nation .			0
