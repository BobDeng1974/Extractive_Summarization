@entity0 is confident the goals will flow for both @entity2 and @entity3 if he is given a run of games as an out - and - out attacker			1
the 23 - year - old begins a new chapter this week after swapping home - town club @entity9 for the @entity10 in a £ 16million deadline day move			1
@entity0 had been with the @entity14 giants since the age of eight , but dropped down the pecking order and grew increasingly frustrated at a lack of opportunities to lead the line			1
and @entity0 is confident goals will continue to rack up if he is allowed to play in his favoured role			1
he said : ' it is well known i prefer to play through the middle so when i get my opportunity i just want to show what i can do			0
' once i get into the box and get the opportunities i have got faith in my ability			0
' before i was n't getting into the box because i was n't playing too much as a striker and i had to worry about my defensive work			0
' listen , anyone can say what they want to say but i just know once i get the opportunity and a run of games up front i will do my best			2
@entity0 scored twice as @entity3 beat @entity31 2 - 0 in their @entity57 qualifier ' that 's definitely what i need			1
it is good for any footballer to get a run of games			2
' you become more confident and play much more at ease and to get a run of games would be absolutely perfect			2
' that is my first 90 minutes this season so it is just the start of things and really looking forward to it			0
' @entity0 says he has not had a decent run of games since @entity74 last year , suggesting monday 's display in @entity76 could be just a taster of what is in store for @entity2 and @entity3			1
the forward impressed up top alongside captain @entity81 , with his goals helping the @entity3 to a much - needed 2 - 0 win after the @entity85 debacle			2
@entity2 signed @entity0 from @entity9 for £ 16million on transfer deadline day ' it was important , ' @entity0 said			1
' it was good for me to get the two goals but it was more important for the whole team to get the win and off to a flying start and to get three points from scratch and that was the most pleasing thing			0
' i think what we have worked this week in training a lot of it showed and that is very pleasing because it showed your hard work is not going to waste and that is what we have got - players in midfield who can break on beyond the attackers and we know if they get behind us we are going to sit in for them			0
' we are fighting for each other as a team and that is most important			0
' @entity20 in @entity22 key to @entity2 success - @entity116			0
