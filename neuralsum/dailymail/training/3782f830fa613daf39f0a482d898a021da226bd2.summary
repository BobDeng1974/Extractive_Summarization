after a wave of concept images that attempt to predict what @entity3 ’s @entity2 will look like , it appears we 've been given a glimpse of the real thing			1
images posted to @entity11 social network @entity10 earlier this week are thought to have been leaked by an anonymous insider working at @entity3 supplier @entity13			1
although the images are blurry , they appear to show a rounded design and a protruding camera , similar to those seen on the @entity19			1
although the images are blurry , they appear to show a rounded design and protruding camera , similar to that seen on the @entity19 @entity3 's @entity2 is rumoured to come in a slim ' @entity29 ' version			1
up until august last year , @entity30 was the record - holder for the thinnest phone in the world with its @entity34 , at 6.18mm			0
this was then replaced by the @entity36 at just 5.75mm			0
by comparison , @entity3 ’s current @entity37 has a depth of 7.6mm , while the @entity40 is slightly thinner at 7.5mm			1
@entity42 's @entity41 is 7.9mm thick , while the @entity43 is 9.3mm			0
alternatively , the models shown in the pictures could be the next generation of @entity3 's mp3 player			0
reports are claiming @entity3 is gearing up to go into mass production of the screen on its next flagship phone as early as next month			2
the first image shows what appears to be a blueprint of the @entity55 , while the other two images of prototype models are shown in silver with rounded edges - similar to those seen on last year ’s @entity40 tablet			1
speculation is rife that @entity3 could follow up this super-thin tablet with an equally slim phone , dubbed @entity29 , and the new images appear to corroborate this			2
earlier this month , @entity68 magazine @entity67 published drawings of what purported to be a 4.7 - inch and 5.7 - inch @entity71			1
earlier this month , @entity68 magazine @entity67 published drawings of what seemed to be a 4.7 - inch and 5.7 - inch @entity71 , pictured			1
the drawings feature a flat , bezel - free device with rectangle - shaped volume controls like those found on the current @entity79 , as well as a camera with a single led - flash on the rear recent concept images by designer @entity84 , pictured , and @entity86 artists @entity87 and @entity88 feature a curved screen with ' bumps ' at the top and bottom , along with an illuminated @entity94 sensor used to recognise fingerprints , first introduced on the @entity37 the drawings feature a flat , bezel - free device with rectangle - shaped volume controls like those found on the current @entity79 , as well as a camera with a single led - flash on the rear			2
recent concept images were then created using the schematics detailed in @entity106 ’s release , by designer @entity84 , and @entity86 artists @entity87 and @entity107			0
these concepts feature a curved screen with ' bumps ' at the top and bottom , along with an illuminated @entity94 sensor used to recognise fingerprints , first introduced on the @entity37			0
the protruding camera and rounded edges of the purported @entity55 prototypes are similar to those seen on the current @entity19 model , pictured the latest mockups come after @entity121 sources said the camera in the @entity55 will get a boost to @entity124 , from its current @entity126 version , along with a new lens offering better picture quality			1
it is also expected to boast a new filter , allowing for clearer pictures			0
if @entity3 follows its usual release schedule , the new models will be unveiled in september this year , although experts are expecting the tech giant to launch at least one model in june			0
@entity3 's new devices are expected to use the in - cell touch panel technology - which embeds sensors more tightly into the screen - seen on previous models to make the next device as thin as possible			2
but reports suggest difficulties with this technology in larger displays has caused @entity3 to delay production of the 5.5 - inch versions			2
it has been widely accepted @entity3 's rumoured 4.7 - inch @entity55 6 ( concept pictured left ) will debut in september , with the 5.5 - inch model launching in 2015			1
this was blamed on manufacturing problems			0
the latest reports , instead , are blaming this staggered release date on @entity3 's marketing strategy			0
