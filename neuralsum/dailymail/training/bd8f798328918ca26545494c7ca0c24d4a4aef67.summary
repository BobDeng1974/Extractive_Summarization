by @entity0 follow @ @ the_topspin @entity1 batted on wednesday as if he did n’t know what all the fuss was about , adding an unbeaten 70 to his first - innings 95 to quieten the debate about the captain ’s form			1
it was just a shame so few people turned up to watch			0
a crowd of 4,784 at the @entity10 felt more like a county @entity12 game than the fourth day of a crucial test			1
the sun was out , spectators went topless , and ice creams were sold			0
but for a state - of - the - art venue staging only its second test , and desperate to host an @entity23 match in 2019 , it was not a good look			1
empty seats : just 4,784 people attended the fourth day between @entity27 and @entity28 at the @entity10 @entity29 : @entity27 have excelled and the @entity1 's ( left ) captaincy has been brilliant but few fans have seen it @entity33 deserve sympathy			1
when they bid for a game in this series , they did not know they would be lumbered with the first sunday start in @entity27 in 135 years			1
this oddity is a consequence of a sardine - like schedule , with five tests crammed into 42 days			0
for @entity33 the effect , ironically , has been anti-commercial : corporate boxes are unfillable at weekends			0
and with the rest of this match played on work days , attendances have fallen away			0
the county ’s chairman @entity51 , who cut an upbeat figure on sunday after 15,000 made their way to @entity56 - despite problems on the roads and railways - was more subdued on wednesday , even though the @entity60 have underwritten potential losses for this game			2
‘ it ’s a massive disappointment , if not totally unexpected , ’ he said			0
‘ we were prepared , because we knew what the ticket sales were going into the match			0
we did everything humanly possible to market the game , but it is a disappointment to see this sort of crowd at a beautiful sunny ground with a game up for grabs			0
’ celebration : @entity27 are on the brink of their first @entity79 victory in 11 matches against @entity28 in the third test @entity51 was not alone			1
‘ shame to see so many empty seats at the @entity10 , ’ tweeted former @entity33 star @entity82			2
‘ starting on sunday is a shame for the club , especially as it ’s produced a great test			2
’ but there are other factors at play			0
for all the good work done at the @entity10 over the years , the venue - situated just off the @entity91 - does not obviously encourage walk - up customers			1
then there ’s the surprising lack of @entity97 fans , a worrying echo of the first test at @entity100			1
former batting star @entity101 suggested : ‘ it ’s a five - @entity79 series with two games in @entity104 and one in @entity106			2
perhaps places like @entity108 and @entity109 are easier to get to			0
’ @entity101 was still playing when @entity28 last toured @entity27 three years ago			2
then , crowds flocked to see @entity111			0
now , @entity97 fans either feel less connection to @entity114 ’s young side , or they ’re waiting for the one - dayers			1
nor is it a coincidence that @entity27 under @entity1 have failed to win any of their last 10 tests			2
whatever the reason , @entity122 cricket should be concerned that a test match played in high summer , and without the distraction of football ’s @entity126 , has attracted so few spectators			0
if five - day cricket really is thriving in @entity27 , there are times when it has a funny way of showing it			1
location : despite the great cricket , the @entity10 is situated next to the @entity91 which stops walk - up customers			1

just 4,784 people attended the fourth day of the third test on wednesday
the @entity10 hopes to host an @entity79 in 2019 but this will not help
it has not helped that this is the first test to start on a sunday in @entity27
the *building* of a *stadium* near @entity91 may also *discourage* walk - up customers
there has also been a surprising lack of @entity97 fans at the @entity10
