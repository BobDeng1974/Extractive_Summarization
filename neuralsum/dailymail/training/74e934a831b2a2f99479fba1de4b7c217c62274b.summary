@entity8 said : ' we found that each individual trip had an average of 92 fare changes between the time fights opened for sale and the time they departed			0
' for domestic flights , the average difference between buying a ticket on the best possible day to buy and the worst was $ 312 ( £ 190 )			0

@entity9 ’s @entity89 said : ' we analysed three years ’ worth of data , representing 200 million searches , in order to be able to provide some clarity to the question of when is the best time to book			0
cheap flights : the most expensive plane trips are booked last minute , according to the findings ' we found five weeks is the best time to book on average , however it is very much dependent on destination			2
' of course , many people will be more comfortable booking further in advance , especially as prices close to departure can be quite volatile			0
' therefore if customers really want to get the very best deal for them our advice would be not to stick to a rigid five week rule , but instead to research prices and track fares for that route by signing up for price alerts , allowing you to see when low fares become available			0

book flights five weeks in advance to get cheapest price
