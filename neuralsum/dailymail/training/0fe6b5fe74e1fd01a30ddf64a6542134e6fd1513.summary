a food blogger has unveiled a new weird and wonderful donut hybrid made using fried ramen noodles			1
@entity4 's ' ramnut ' follows in the footsteps of pastry chef @entity10 's infamous @entity9 - and @entity8 's world - renowned @entity6 , taking the trend one step further in order to combine sweet and savory in one calorific treat			1
while some might not be too convinced by the bizarre blend flavors and textures , ramnut creator @entity4 , who runs foodie blog @entity20 , insists that the custard - and jelly - stuffed delights ' tastes really good '			1
' i 'd do some things differently to optimize the recipe - make them thinner to create more surface area , fry at a lower temperature to allow for more oil penetration , ' @entity49			1
' if you really think about it , there 's no reason this should n't taste good , it 's just fried dough and sugar			1
' @entity4 's ramnuts are made using instant ramen noodles that have been cooked in a special cinnamon - spiced milk and then molded into a traditional donut shape , before being stuffed and iced with more conventional sugary ingredients			1
the 21 - year - old @entity61 student admits that the idea might be off - putting to some , but insists that he ' really enjoyed ' the end result			2
he even goes as far as to suggest that his iced delights can compete with pastry chef @entity10 's world - famous @entity9 - and kindly offers mr @entity10 the opportunity to work with him on any future @entity69 creations			2
' my provisional copyright on the name “ ramnut ” is officially on sale , ' @entity4 writes on his website			1
' looking for $ 50 and an @entity77 gift card			2
get at me , @entity10			2
' despite the early success of his noodle - based creation , the budding chef readily admits that its creation could have been a disaster			2
donut - shaped delight : each ramen donut is stuffed and iced with more conventional sugary ingredients sweet treat showdown : @entity4 has offered @entity9 creator @entity10 the opportunity to get in on the ramnut action ' i do n’t want to consume food culture , i want to produce it , ' he explains			1
' by recycling the same @entity96 recipe for red velvet kit - kat cheesecake over and over , you ’re complicit within cultural stagnation ; you ’re taking things from the conversation without adding anything new			2
i ’m just trying to spark up a few lines of dialogue			2
' i want to do things that are unique , things that have never been done before , and whether they taste good or not is tertiary to the real goal of progress			1
' i ’m going to shotgun method the foodie frontier until i hit a f * * * * * g bullseye			0
' try it at home : @entity4 was more than happy to share his ramnut recipe with the readers of his blog unlike mr @entity10 , who , until the recent launch of his new cookbook , kept his croissant donut recipe a closely - guarded secret , @entity4 has readily shared each and every step of the ramnut - making process on his blog			1
indeed , he encourages any curious food lovers to try out the recipe for themselves so that they can experience the unique taste sensation for themselves , but warns that the process took up ' 12 hours of my life '			1
' they ’re starchy , they ’re crispy , they ’re covered in frosting and stuffed with custard — that ’s about all i can tell you , ' he writes			0
' i enjoyed them in my mouth , i enjoyed them a lot , but as we just discussed , that information is pretty much useless			0
i urge you to make them yourself and figure it out			0
