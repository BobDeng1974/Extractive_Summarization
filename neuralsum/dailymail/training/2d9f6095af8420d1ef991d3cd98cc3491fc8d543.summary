@entity1 brothers @entity2 and @entity3 can not go to bed until the other is home safely			1
they speak on the phone after every training session or match and credit each other for their progress in life , on and off the pitch			2
they are devastated that their @entity17 third - round ties fall on the same day			1
there is , then , respect , love and friendship			2
that , however , very quickly changes when @entity23 midfielder @entity2 – regarded as one of the best players outside of the @entity26 - expresses regret that they were not drawn against @entity3 ’s @entity28 , the lowest - ranked team left in the competition			1
‘ i would have been buzzing if we ’d got them			2
it would filter out another bad team then we ’d have the chance of getting a big dog in the fourth round , ’ @entity2 tells @entity30 from the family home where they grew up in @entity33			1
@entity3 ( left ) and @entity40 pose with their mum @entity41 before the @entity17 third round this weekend footballing twins @entity3 and @entity2 speak to @entity30 's @entity45 ahead of their @entity17 encounters the pair ( pictured graduating from @entity48 ) have been kept apart in the third round the twins were at the same team together aged nine but have played against each other professionally @entity3 – who scored a free - kick live on tv during @entity28 ’s second - round victory over @entity55 and who was caught at the centre of the storm which saw @entity59 expelled from the @entity17 in 2006 – bites back : ‘ this clown is n’t for real			1
he thinks @entity23 are some sort of @entity64 team			1
we beat @entity55 in the league above them – we ’d more than match them			1
’ as it is , @entity28 entertain championship side @entity69 and @entity70 promotion hopefuls @entity23 travel to @entity64 @entity73			1
@entity74 , @entity41 , and sister , @entity75 , will be at @entity76 , while dad , @entity78 , and brother , @entity79 , will be at @entity80			2
the last time the family was split in this fashion was when @entity28 hosted @entity23 in the @entity83 in 2011			1
it is the only time in their 27 years that the twins – who were professionals together at @entity55 and team - mates at @entity48 ’s academy - have started a match in opposition			1
@entity23 won 2 - 0 and @entity2 was star man			1
‘ it was great to play against each other – i wanted to do him and he wanted to do me , ’ says @entity3			1
@entity2 corrects him : ‘ yeah , but i did do you – you did n’t do me			2
i absolutely ran the gaff and he was spewing			2
’ @entity3 , reluctantly , agrees : ‘ to be fair , he was man - of - the - match by a mile			1
i told our lads , “ sit on my kid , stop him playing and we ’ll win ”			2
but one of our strikers – he was a lazy b * * * * * d – he just let him dictate things			2
they had me left - midfield but if i ’d played in the centre we would have won – i ’d have bullied him			2
’ the pair had just moved out of their family home before the tie and bought their first place together			2
following the draw , @entity3 ran tape down one half of the house and drew up boundaries			1
@entity120 spread and it soon attracted media attention			2
@entity2 recalls : ‘ someone rang us out of the blue and said , “ can you go on the radio now ? ”			2
we just thought it would be @entity128			2
we did n’t realise until afterwards it was national radio – we battered each other , saying we going to slap each other and all sorts			2
@entity3 plays for @entity28 while @entity2 is a midfielder for nearby @entity23 the duo 's sister @entity75 , pictured with her six - day - old son , will be at @entity76 to watch @entity3 the twin brothers , aged 14 , will be hoping to face each other in the fourth round of the @entity17 4 - this is the fourth time @entity28 have reached the @entity17 third round			1
they were knocked out in 1971 - 72 and 2008 - 09 but beat @entity143 in 1977 - 78 before famously progressing to the fifth round			2
‘ then the tv cameras came			2
we ’d just bought the house off our nana			0
the carpets were horrific , the worst you ’ve ever seen			0
‘ after we were on @entity151 we got a phone call from someone asking to buy the carpets			0
we thought it was a wind - up			0
@entity3 spoke to them and said , “ @entity157 , come around , you can buy them , no bother ”			1
‘ next thing , this couple turn up at the door over the moon that they ’re getting the carpets			0
they owned a farm and gave us £ 50 and 12 eggs			0
’ result , too , is what they both enjoyed in the last round of the cup			2
@entity3 curled into the top corner what @entity174 described as ‘ the best free - kick i ’ve ever seen ’ during @entity28 ’s heroic 2 - 1 win at @entity55			1
@entity2 , who was in the away end at @entity179 that night , then starred as @entity23 beat @entity180 2 - 0 , also on tv			1
their sister gave birth to @entity185 48 hours later and @entity3 was back on @entity151 for the third - round draw			1
@entity3 celebrates after @entity28 knocked out @entity55 in the second round ‘ it was just an incredible few days for the family , ’ says @entity188 ‘ i went down to @entity55 and got a little bit of stick off some of the fans for being a @entity23 player			1
i was n’t a @entity28 fan , i was a @entity3 fan			1
‘ when his free - kick went in i was sucking the ball into the back of the net , i went off it			0
i looked over to my mam and dad and i could see they were bursting with pride			0
it was a special day for the whole family			0
my sister was watching at home , we thought it might send her into labour			0
it was just the perfect @entity17 night			1
’ back in 2006 , however , the @entity17 was far from perfect for @entity3			1
on loan at @entity59 from @entity55 , he had helped them to a 2 - 0 victory over @entity216 – including a certain @entity217 - to land a tie at @entity219 in the third round			1
@entity3 looks back : ‘ i had a kip after training one day , woke up in the hotel room and put @entity222 on			1
there it was , my picture on the telly ! i thought i was having a nightmare			0
i just thought “ what the f … ”			0
‘ we ’d been kicked out of the cup because i was ineligible , the secretaries had n’t registered me			0
i felt guilty because people did n’t realise it was n’t my fault			0
’ @entity2 was back at home on @entity235 , also unaware of what had happened			0
‘ i saw it on the news and thought , “ what the hell is going on here ? why is my twin on @entity238 ? ” , ’ he remembers			2
‘ it ’s funny though , we were in the pub on a quiz machine one day and that question came up			0
it ’s been mentioned in wedding speeches and all sorts			0
’ the brothers themselves are yet to marry , although @entity2 moved in with his girlfriend earlier this month – ‘ i secretly hate his missus for taking him away , ’ says @entity3			1
it is the first time they have not shared a house and both agree they would have been lost without each other			0
@entity2 says : ‘ being twins is so good for you			0
if he did something then it spurred me to do it			0
for example , when we were at @entity55 after signing @entity265 , i kicked on a bit and got picked for @entity269 youths			1
i came back and he was nutting the back gate – he was going off it			0
’ ‘ i felt like a reject , ’ says @entity3			1
‘ he got called up for @entity269 and i could n’t get in the youth team			0
two months later i was in the first - team			0
that ’s always been the way , one of us would do something then the other would do something better			0
’ @entity3 celebrates after scoring in his side 's 2 - 1 win against @entity55 in the second round of the @entity17 @entity23 's @entity2 will be hoping his side can eliminate @entity64 outfit @entity73 @entity2 adds : ‘ it was like at the end of last season when we went to @entity287 in the conference play - offs , it was amazing			1
‘ then he comes in with a @entity290 and scores a free - kick in front of £ 2.4million people			0
’ before that goal , engineer @entity3 had spent six months in the boiler room of a cruise ship			1
‘ it was horrific – 45 degrees and proper graft , ’ says the @entity28 anchorman			1
‘ i never thought i ’d be playing in the third round of the @entity17 when i was in there			1
but i ’ll be back on the ships in 2016 , this will be my last year playing football			0
‘ you have to think long - term , we ’re not playing in the @entity2 ’s the same and he ’s doing his teacher training			0
we went to college when we were professionals at @entity55 and got our degrees together			1
we ’re switched on in that sense			0
you have to be at the level we ’re at			0
‘ we ’ve always made sacrifices – missing school discos , @entity316 , holidays – and i suppose all of this now is a little bit of payback			0
’ is there , though , another chapter to be written in the story of the @entity3 twins ? @entity3 insists : ‘ both of us can definitely get a result			1
we wo n’t get battered			0
‘ the pitch at our place is n’t great , it ’ll be freezing cold and the ground will be rammed and rocking			0
‘ you ’ve got to remember – they ’ve got two arms , two legs and a head			0
i ’ve played against players from the @entity336 and yeah , they ’re consistently better , but we can be better than them on our day			0
’ with this pair , you get the feeling there might just be another tale to tell come tea - time .			0
