by @entity0 its nickname , the @entity3 , does n't exactly conjure up images of a fast - paced 24/7 city but it seems international visitors ca n't get enough of @entity3			1
the city has just been voted the best city in @entity10 - the latest accolade for the @entity10 capital			1
@entity3 narrowly beat @entity13 , followed @entity14 in third - with @entity15 ranked seventh among reviewers , just beating top - end city @entity17			1

every commendation @entity3 has received in the past 18 - months is quick to note the city 's proximity to @entity10 's famed @entity38 - one of the country 's key wine regions			1
' like a perfectly cellared red , it ’s ready to be uncorked and sampled , ' the @entity25 list claims			0
@entity38 : @entity10 's @entity38 is a key @entity10 wine region and lies only 40 minutes outside of @entity3 who knew @entity3 was famous for the beaches ? the beaches of @entity10 have been highlighted as worth visiting by several publications @entity3 ( @entity10 ) - @entity49 ( @entity50 ) - @entity51 ( @entity52 ) - @entity53 ( @entity54 ) - @entity55 ( @entity56 ) - @entity57 ( @entity58 ) - @entity59 ( @entity60 ) - @entity61 ( @entity62 ) - 3.88/5 @entity60 - 3,004,914 @entity63 - 764,545 @entity10 - @entity50 - 159,318 meanwhile , two @entity65 publications - @entity66 and the @entity67 - wrote glowing reviews of the @entity10 capital in 2013			1
' @entity3 has eclectic cuisine , idyllic beaches , @entity72 wineries , and kangaroo - spotting galore — but with a fraction of the tourists and for a whole lot cheaper , ' @entity70 wrote in a @entity66 article titled ' @entity3 instead of @entity15 ' in october of last year			2
the magazine 's main claim that @entity3 trumps @entity15 as being the best city : it has ' a fraction of the tourists ' and is ' a whole lot cheaper ' than visiting the eastern @entity10 capitals that dominate tourism tables in terms of actual visitors			1
another controversial claim in the magazine is that @entity3 is @entity10 's equivalent to @entity65 hipster capital @entity94			2
despite the latest poll , by tourism website @entity96 , many @entity95 would disagree , claiming that @entity14 - with it 's coffee culture , laneway bars and active live music scene - would certainly be considered the ' hipster capital '			2
@entity102 's everywhere : the @entity67 noted @entity10 's @entity104 as a key region to visit @entity3 the @entity106 : @entity3 's @entity107 is a key part of the city 's rejuvenation process similarly , the @entity67 featured @entity104 as another key region to visit @entity3			0

while magazines , tourist guides and hotel booking website may be ranking @entity3 as @entity10 's most popular city , the claim would definitely be refuted by official tourist figures by @entity126 agency @entity125			0
despite coming first in the @entity96 survey , @entity10 comes in fifth based on actual tourist traffic to the state			0
having come in second - last in this survey , @entity15 ( and @entity60 ) can breathe a sigh of relief - in terms of actual tourist figures , it 's still number one			0
@entity15 still number one : despite coming in seventh on @entity96 's hotel ranking list , @entity60 is still the number one state in terms on actual tourist numbers - followed by @entity54 ( @entity139 pictured left ) @entity140 and fourth : @entity52 ( @entity14 's @entity141 pictured left ) and @entity56 ( @entity143 's @entity142 pictured right ) are ranked third and fourth , according to official tourism figures			2
