by @entity0 published : 03:52 est , 20 june 2012 updated : 02:13 est , 26 june 2012 the @entity2 gentleman has had a makeover			2
gone are the days when he would never be seen dead without a cigarette in his mouth and a @entity7 in his driveway			0
instead of sporting a bushy moustache , today 's gent favours the clean - shaven look and chews nicotine gum			1
he gets from a to b in a @entity13 and eats muesli with blueberries for breakfast rather than smoked kipper			0
gents : @entity19 has gentlemanly ' good manners ' , while sir @entity21 was courteous , according to new book @entity23 , which examined @entity24 over the last century the modern upper class man quaffs @entity27 @entity26 instead of claret and is more likely to go tieless than don a cravat			1
the findings were published in a book called @entity33 's pursuits , which examined the pages of @entity24 over the past century to see how standards have changed			0
according to the list , an archetypal gent living in 1912 would attend the @entity38 , live in @entity39 , go tobogganing in @entity40 in @entity41 and enjoy the works of poet and writer @entity44			0
celebrated : actor @entity45 ( left ) should be admired for his self - deprecation , while polar explorer @entity47 was a perfect gentleman for rescuing his men by comparison , the upper - class man of 2012 prefers the mud of @entity54 music festival , lives in @entity55 , goes skiing in @entity57 in @entity58 and reads historical books by @entity60			1
cover : the findings were published in a book called @entity33 's pursuits , which examined the pages of @entity24 over the past century the book 's five gentleman of the year are the @entity68 for his ' stiff upper lip ' , @entity70 for his ' quiet dignity ' , actor @entity45 for ' self - deprecation ' , heavily tattooed footballer @entity19 for ' good manners ' and @entity75 mayor @entity74 for his ' charming apologies '			1
its five ' perfect gentleman ' , who epitomised all that is chivalrous and good about their breed , were named as sir @entity21 for ' courtesy ' , the @entity77 for their ' heroism when facing certain death ' , dandy @entity85 ( 1778 – 1840 ) for ' exquisite dressing ' , explorer @entity47 for rescuing his men and @entity88 , the former foreign secretary and secretary general of @entity91 , for ' knowing when to resign '			2
former @entity93 captain @entity19 's inclusion would certainly have been controversial in 1912 , given the number of tattoos that adorn his body , but the magazine said : ' tattoos were all the rage among gentlemen , including royalty , so @entity19 's passion is bang on trend			1
' although the @entity104 at @entity105 may take a different view			0
' there are some things , however , according to the book , that a ' gentleman would never do '			0
faux pas include owning a yacht with no sails , wearing pink socks , ordering @entity116 champagne and taking a holiday in @entity118			2
@entity119 : the upper - class man of 2012 likes going to @entity54 music festival home , @entity122 : gentlemen typically once drove cars like this @entity125 @entity126 , @entity24 's editor , told the @entity127 : ' @entity128 once described ; " the @entity93 country gentleman galloping after a fox – the unspeakable in full pursuit of the uneatable " but he failed to recognise the genius of the idea in the first place			2
' this book celebrates what he missed			0
' cigarettes and alcohol : @entity74 , seen left supping a pint , is described in the book as having ' charming apologies ' , while @entity143 , smoking , right , is seen by many as the quintessential @entity93 gent stoic : the book says the @entity68 epitomises the @entity2 gent with the stiff upper lip , while the @entity77 , depicted here in a 1936 film , displayed ' heroism when facing certain death '			1

modern gents include @entity19 , @entity45 , @entity74 and the @entity68
gentlemanly *traits* include having good manners and self - deprecation
