by @entity0 women who live near green open spaces tend to give birth to heavier babies , scientists say			1
researchers looked at 40,000 single births in @entity8 , @entity9 , to work out what impact living within 300 metres of a major green space during pregnancy has on birth outcomes			1
' major ' was defined as being 5,000 meters squared , while green spaces included parks , community gardens or even cemeteries that were partly or completely covered with grass , trees , shrubs , or other vegetation			1
women who live near large green spaces have bigger babies , research suggests			1
this may be because those from poorer areas have less access to large areas of outside space ' we found that that overall , an increase of surrounding greenery near the home was associated with a significant increase of birth weight - and decreased risk for low birth weight , ' said professor @entity42 , of @entity43			1
' this was the first study outside of the @entity45 and @entity46 demonstrating associations between greenery and birth weight , as well as the first to report the association with low birth weight			2
' one reason may be because the lowest birth weight occurred in the most economically deprived areas with lack of access to green spaces			1
the study was published in the journal @entity59			0
it comes after @entity45 researchers found that trees in urban areas save over 850 lives a year by scrubbing the air clean			0
although they ability to remove pollution from the atmosphere equates to an average air quality improvement of less than 1 per cent , researchers estimate this prevents 670,000 cases of serious chest , heart or circulation problems in @entity45 cities alone			0
' in terms of impacts on human health , trees in urban areas are substantially more important than rural trees due to their proximity to people			2
' we found that in general , the greater the tree cover , the greater the pollution removal , and the greater the removal and population density , the greater the value of human health benefits			0
' other new research has found that trees in urban areas save over 850 lives a year by scrubbing the air clean @entity93 , director of the @entity95 's @entity94 said : ' with more than 80 per cent of @entity45 living in urban area , this research underscores how truly essential urban forests are to people across the nation			2
' the study looked at four pollutants which have established air quality standards , nitrogen dioxide , ozone , sulfur dioxide , and particulate matter less than 2.5 microns ( @entity107 ) in aerodynamic diameter			0
the effects of air pollution on pulmonary , cardiac , vascular , and neurological systems were also taken into account			0
the research , which was the first national study using air pollution modelling to reveal the life saving qualities of trees , was published in the journal @entity121 .			0

@entity124 spaces were defined by areas partly or completely covered with grass
conclusions were drawn after looking at 40,000 birth weights in @entity9
people from economically deprived areas ' have less access to green space '
