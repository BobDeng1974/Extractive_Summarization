mr @entity16 was photographed leaving mr @entity1 's @entity70 this afternoon clutching copies of the draft manifesto			1

' the subjects mentioned – tax , mental health and education – were the key themes of @entity1 's @entity261 speech			1
and unlike @entity262 , we think tackling the deficit should be a top priority for the next government			0
