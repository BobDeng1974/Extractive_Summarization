amateur genealogists are spoilt for choice when it comes to researching their family history online , and now the latest tool at their disposal is their dna			2
three years after launching in the @entity9 , family history site @entity7 has extended its @entity11 service - a home testing kit that unlocks the secrets of a person ’s genetic ethnicity - to the @entity16			1
it is part of a rising trend for these kits , but @entity7 ’s service sets itself apart because results can be cross-checked with millions of family trees to help people discover unknown relatives			1

it is the latest in home testing kits that unlock the secrets of a person ’s genetic ethnicity			2
it follows a rising trend in home testing kits , but @entity7 ’s service sets itself apart from others because results can be cross-checked with family trees ( process pictured ) since it was released in 2012 , @entity11 has been used by around 700,000 people			1
all of these results have been stored on a secure , encrypted database , and each set of results is linked to a person ’s individual ancestry account and subsequent family tree			2
the test uses microarray - based autosomal dna testing , which looks at person ’s entire genome at more than 700,000 locations via a sample of saliva			1
analysis of the @entity6 data provides a prediction of the locations of ancestors from 26 separate populations including @entity54 and @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 and @entity59 and @entity60			0

analysis of the @entity6 data provides a prediction of the locations of ancestors from 26 separate populations ( pictured ) @entity11 can also help people identify relationships with unknown relatives through a list of possible dna member matches ( example pictured )			1
these results can then be combined with @entity7 ’s existing database of 15 billion records and 60 million family trees to trace more lineages in contrast to y - chromosome or mitochondrial dna tests , which only test one line of a person 's family and provides information about ancestry several thousand years ago , the @entity11 autosomal test targets the last few hundred or thousand years			1
this makes it easier for people to learn more about their more immediate family history			0

another service that offers dna testing is @entity54 ’s @entity6			1
it offers a range of options , including tests that look purely at a person ’s fatherline , or surname line			0
the site also offers tests that traces a person ’s motherline along every known mitochondrial @entity6 branch , consisting of more than 3,000 markers mitochondrial dna is a smaller than the y chromosome , containing fewer letters , so these markers account for all known @entity147 lineages			1
elsewhere , the all my ancestry test uses more than 250,000 autosomal markers to discover a person ’s recent ancestral mix. it can reveal if someone has a @entity156 ancestry , or how far a genome spreads across @entity56			1
it compares the data to a set of reference samples of known ancestry , including 4,000 individuals from 200 populations from all over the world			0
this test shows which population a person is closest to , genetically , and what proportions of their ancestry are from each of seven continental level groups			0
other tests include discovering the genetics of a person ’s eye colour , and whether a person carries a red - head variant gene – even if they do n’t have red hair			0
@entity181 , vice president , genomics and bioinformatics at @entity7 , said : ‘ while family history research is most often focused on discovering more about the past , the @entity11 test uses the best modern technology to help users find out more than ever before about who they are and where they came from			0
‘ when used in conjunction with existing ancestry services , it also provides an exciting opportunity to discover and connect with new relatives - in fact the vast majority of customers from the @entity16 and @entity55 can expect to connect with 3rd or 4th cousins in the @entity9 immediately			0
the tests cost £ 99 ( $ 99 ) , plus shipping , and results take up to eight weeks to be delivered			0

@entity275 is an @entity9 - based site that offers a similar service to @entity7			2
it currently has a database of 711,925 records , at the time of writing .			0

@entity11 studies a person ’s genome from 700,000 genetic locations
@entity287 uses microarray - based autosomal dna testing using a saliva sample
dna results are added to a database linked to family trees on the site
results are cross-checked with these trees to search for a potential match
this could help amateur genealogists discover unknown relatives
and , as more people take the test , the range of results will *increase*
@entity11 kits costs £ 99 and results are returned within eight weeks
@entity54 ’s @entity6 offers a similar service that tests more than 250,000 autosomal markers , as well as person ’s *maternal* and *paternal* lineage
