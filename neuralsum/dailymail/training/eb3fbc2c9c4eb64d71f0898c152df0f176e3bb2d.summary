one chillax too many : @entity3 the @entity5 cat has been sacked as chief mouse catcher by @entity10 after a dismal performance this year new predator : mr @entity10 has brought in chancellor @entity23 's tabby @entity21 ( above ) as the chief mouser in place of @entity3 it took @entity3 six months in the post before he made his first ' confirmed kill ' last month and he does n't appear to have made any since			1
the breaking point came on thursday when the prime minister found @entity3 asleep on his chair in his number 10 study as a mouse ran across the room , according to the people			2
he attempted to wake @entity3 to spur him into action , but all the feline could manage was to open one eye and duly did n't budge an inch			2
mr @entity10 has now drafted in chancellor @entity23 's tabby @entity21 as the new @entity41 to patrol @entity42 , 11 and 12			1
sources claim @entity3 will be completely sidelined and have described the new arrangement as a ' job share ' to avoid any hurt feelings			2

but he soon found himself hoisted up by a police protection officer and dumped unceremoniously by no 11 , where @entity10 and @entity74 live			0
on the hunt : @entity21 was just a few months old when she went missing from the @entity77 ’ home three years ago , but was returned to them earlier this year trading places : @entity21 lives with the @entity81 in the flat above no 10 ( right ) , while the @entity83 and their cat @entity3 live above no 11 ( left ) @entity3 , a rescue cat from @entity86 , was hailed as a ‘ good ratter ’ and having ‘ a high chase - drive and hunting instinct ’ when he first arrived in @entity5			1
