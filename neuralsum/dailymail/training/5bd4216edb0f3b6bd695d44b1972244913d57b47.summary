by @entity0 published : 05:21 est , 30 august 2013 updated : 12:37 est , 30 august 2013 the 11 - year - old son of @entity3 president , @entity2 , has apparently dared the @entity4 to launch an attack , in a @entity7 taunt that has been ' liked ' by the children and grandchildren of other senior @entity3 officials			1
' i just want them to attack sooo much , because i want them to make this huge mistake of beginning something that they do n’t know the end of it , ' stated the post on an account said to belong to @entity21			1
the comments were posted in response to moves by the @entity4 to launch a strike in response to a chemical weapons attack on august 21			1
daring the @entity4 : a @entity7 post said to be written by the 11 - year - old son of president @entity21 asks for the @entity4 to attack and ' make a huge mistake ' however , the authenticity of the @entity7 profile is hard to confirm			1
while it shows a younger picture of @entity21 , the owner 's profile also states that he is a a graduate of @entity36 and a player for a @entity39 soccer team - neither of which are likely for an 11 - year - old boy living in @entity43			2
but it does also state that he is a graduate of a montessori school in @entity43 , a detail confirmed within a profile on @entity21 's mother , @entity48 , which appeared in @entity50 in february 2011			0
the post has also attracted many ' likes ' and comments from accounts appearing to belong to the families of members of @entity21 's administration			0
among these are comments apparently posted by the two children of deputy vice president @entity60 , @entity61 and @entity62 , and three children of a former deputy defence minister , @entity64 , who was killed in a bombing in july 2012			0
a @entity3 journalist from @entity43 , who wished to remain anonymous , told the @entity68 that the accounts belonging to mr @entity64 's son , @entity70 and daughters , @entity72 and @entity73 , appeared to be authentic			2
stepping into the political arena ? @entity21 pictured with his father @entity2 several years ago the children are also direct cousins of @entity21 , as mr @entity64 was married to the @entity3 president 's sister			2
many of the @entity7 profile pictures of those who commented have been changed to show pictures of the @entity3 premier or his father , also named @entity21 , who ruled the country for 30 years before his son took power in 2000			1
the post is also littered with spelling and grammar mistakes , which would not be unusual for a child author			0
whether authentic or not , the post illustrates the support that president @entity21 continues to garner , despite a two - year civil war that has killed more than 1000,000 @entity3 and caused millions to flee for their lives			1
the post also shows that those who do support @entity21 are unafraid of any @entity4 retaliation			2
' they may have the best army in the world , maybe the best airplanes , ships , tanks than ours , but soldiers ? ' no one has soldiers like the ones we do in @entity3			0
@entity4 does n’t have soldiers , what it has is some cowards with new technology who claim themselves liberators			0
' the author also compares any possible action by @entity4 to the 2006 war between @entity117 and the @entity119 militant group @entity118 , one of the @entity21 regime 's closest allies in the current conflict			0
in a chilling taunt , the post stated : ' what did @entity118 have back then ? some street fighters and some small rockets and a pile of guns , but they had belief , in theirselves and in their country and that ’s exactly what ’s gon na happen to @entity4 if it chooses invasion because they do n’t know our land like we do , no one does , victory is ours in the end no matter how much time it takes			0
' investigation : a member of a @entity149 team takes samples near a missile believed to be one of the chemical rockets fired at civilians in @entity43 last week civil war : free @entity157 fighters run from snipers loyal to @entity3 's president @entity2 call for action : despite the @entity163 vote against action , the @entity161 administration has suggested it may still retaliate against @entity3 against war : despite @entity161 's calls for military action , these demonstrators protested against an attack on @entity3 outside the @entity169 yesterday			1

@entity21 apparently dared the @entity4 to launch an attack and make a ' huge mistake '
@entity174 posted after @entity161 administration said it may still use military action to respond to chemical weapons attack last week
while authenticity of @entity7 profile is hard to confirm , the post has been ' liked ' by accounts belonging to the children of senior @entity3 officials
@entity186 illustrates strong support for the @entity3 president , despite a two - year civil war that has killed more than *100,000* and caused millions to flee
