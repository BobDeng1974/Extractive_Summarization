by @entity1 correspondent @entity3 , pictured with wife @entity2 , has been criticised for his comments , with one psychologist calling them ' soul - destroying ' @entity3 has been accused of ‘ glorifying sexual violence ’ after he said women secretly love being ‘ ravished ’ by men			1
the writer claimed that @entity12 novels from the 18th century catered for ‘ female fantasies ’ because the heroines only ever had sex if they had been drugged			1
he says women friends have told him it was a ‘ good fantasy ’ to have because ‘ if you enjoy it it ’s not your fault ’			2
his comments were immediately seized on by critics , who accused him of perpetuating the myth that women enjoy such encounters			1
they also said he was contributing to a culture in which sexual violence was seen as normal			0
@entity3 , 64 , who was nominated for the @entity30 in 2012 for a section in his novel @entity32 , made his comments in an interview for the @entity35 show @entity3 ’s @entity12			1
they appear in this week ’s @entity38 before the programme screens this sunday			0
discussing the development of the @entity12 novel since the 18th century , he said : ‘ in that formative period of the @entity12 novel , the only way that a heroine can have sex is by being drugged and that ties in with fantasies , female fantasies of being ravished			1
‘ i talked to women about this and they said , it is a good fantasy , especially when you ’re young , because if you enjoy it , it ’s not your fault			2
’ @entity3 said in later novels , women of the lower classes and decadent society ladies are allowed to have sex , but heroines are not			1
he said the only exception is @entity63 in @entity65 ’s @entity64 , adding : ‘ it ’s perfectly clear that she is far and away the most sexual of @entity65 ’s heroines			0
’ last night , clinical psychologist dr @entity69 said she was ‘ horrified ’ by the writer ’s remarks			1
‘ i find these kind of comments soul - destroying , as a woman and as a mother , ’ she said			1
‘ this is the kind of thing you see in porn all the time			0
women are depicted as objects at the whim of men ’s desires			0
‘ men are brought up not to take no for an answer when it comes to sex			0
several of @entity3 's novels - including @entity32 and the @entity92 - have been criticised for lurid sex scenes and he was nominated for the @entity30 in 2012 ‘ they are encouraged to think that if they push harder , women will enjoy their advances			1
@entity3 ’s comments just reinforce that view			1
' he makes sexual violence seem normal , even desirable			0
it is sending out an awful message , not least to young men			1
’ a spokesman for @entity103 said last night : ‘ if the implication is that women enjoy being raped , that ’s of course incredibly unhelpful myth - peddling and potentially not just offensive but distressing to the large numbers of sexual violence survivors who ’ll inevitably read the @entity38 interview			1
’ @entity3 made the comments in his show @entity115 's @entity12 which were printed in this week 's @entity38 several of @entity3 ’s own novels – including @entity32 and his 1973 book @entity118 – have been criticised for lurid sex scenes , which are mainly written from a male point of view			1
in 2012 , the author admitted that he thought women were better at writing about sex than men , because men often felt inadequate about their own performance			0
at the time , he said : ‘ i ’d say the reason why women write better about sex – which is almost impossible to write about and no one has done it very well , ever – is that as a novelist you are in a @entity134 - like relation to what you create			1
' you are omnipotent and the question of potency is embarrassing for men			0
’ @entity3 is married to @entity140 heiress and writer @entity141 , who is his second wife			2
he has credited her with finally bringing an end to his womanising ways , and the pair have two teenage children together , @entity146 and @entity147			0
in june 2011 , @entity3 moved to @entity148 with his family to be closer to her parents as well as his best friend , the writer @entity152 , who has since died of cancer			2
they now live in the @entity156 area of @entity157			0
sir @entity158 had ' erotic dreams ' about the queen according to his son @entity161 @entity3 has told how his novelist father sir @entity162 had ‘ erotic dreams ’ about the @entity160			2
he said the celebrated author , who died in 1995 , had been ‘ very keen ’ on the monarch			0
‘ my father used to hang out with the @entity160 a bit , went to lunch there several times and he was knighted by her , ’ he said			0
‘ he was very keen on her and even used to have erotic dreams about her			0
’ discussing class and the monarchy for a @entity35 show , @entity3 also claimed the @entity179 is ‘ nearing the end of the road ’			2
praising the monarchy ’s ‘ remarkable quality ’ , he added : ‘ it ’s connected with our love of @entity183 , those country - house dramas , it ’s nostalgia for that class society			2
’ @entity3 also revealed that his father – who won the @entity188 in 1986 for @entity189 – had spoken in a ‘ lah - di - dah way ’ in a bid to sound smarter			1
and he said class in the @entity193 was now replaced by money			0
‘ if you put your son ’s name down for @entity199 it ’s because you can afford to , ’ he said .			0
