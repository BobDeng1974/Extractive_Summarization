for any woman who adores wearing heels , @entity0 , the @entity2 - born socialite who has graced countless red carpets from @entity4 to @entity5 , offers a cautionary tale			1
bizarre as it may sound , the 33 - year - old ’s partying came to an abrupt halt after an accident in a nightclub involving her stilettos			1
and @entity0 ’s recovery is just as remarkable			1
after a year of sticking to conventional treatment with only limited success , it took a controversial holistic therapy to see her back on track – and in heels again			1
@entity0 broke her tibia in three places and suffered a broken foot when a man landed on her in a nightclub @entity0 , wearing her customary designer clothes and @entity30 shoes , was enjoying a night out at risque @entity32 club @entity33 in november 2011 when an admirer tapped her on the shoulder			1
@entity0 turned awkwardly and the man suddenly lost his footing , sending them both crashing to the floor			1
‘ it was pretty horrendous , ’ recalls @entity0			1
‘ all i remember was having most of his weight on my knee and hearing something tear			0
i knew immediately i was in serious trouble			0
’ she was rushed to @entity47 where it was revealed she had broken her tibia in three places , suffered a broken foot and torn ligaments in her arm			2
she spent the next three months with her leg in a cast			0
‘ i was in a wheelchair at first , and then on crutches with a moon boot			0
it was n’t a great @entity59 , ’ @entity55 recalls			0
in fact , 2012 was n’t great either			0
despite physiotherapy , @entity0 ’s foot would not heal completely			1
‘ the bone was out of alignment and i was experiencing shoulder and neck pain , ’ she says			0
with her right foot still swollen , the socialite had to buy her favourite louboutins in the next size up			2
‘ shoes have always been an expensive habit , but i did n’t expect to have to buy second pairs , ’ she laughs			0
it was only when she visited little - known clinic @entity76 that her health improved rapidly it was only when she visited a little - known clinic in @entity80 that spring that @entity0 ’s health improved rapidly			1
@entity76 is one of the few centres in the world to offer @entity84 ( @entity84 ) , a controversial technique that uses injections of embryonic stem cells from animals			1
the clinic claims success with diseases such as @entity92 ’s			2
while human stem cells have been used in conventional treatments such as bone marrow transplants since the 1960s , the use of animal cells is unregulated			1
there is no scientific evidence to prove they are either safe or effective			0
@entity102 , consultant orthopaedic surgeon at @entity32 , says : ‘ the length of time it takes for a serious fracture to heal depends on many factors but you are looking at three to four months rather than weeks			0
‘ treatments using anything other than human stem cells have no scientific evidence of working			1
it is difficult to say what may make a subject feel better			0
if i were to inject 100 patients with water , 50 would say they felt better afterwards			0
’ however , @entity0 says the £ 15,000 @entity84 treatment enabled her to make a full recovery			1
on the first day she was given blood tests , then a bespoke vitamin drip for an hour alongside oxygen therapy			2
the next day she was given a series of @entity84 injections in her lower back , right foot and affected joints			1
one side effect was extreme tiredness and she says she slept afterwards for ‘ a day and a half			0
’ when she awoke , @entity0 conducted her own test – involving her old shoes			2
‘ they were the same louboutins i wore on the night of the accident			2
i kept them on for two days without any pain or swelling to my right foot or leg – that ’s when i knew the treatment had worked			2
’ a year on she remains pain - free and has resumed her party lifestyle			0
has any doubt crept in the treatment might be harmful ? ‘ never , ’ she says			0
‘ it felt an instinctive way for the body to heal and the results i ’ve had are proof of how well @entity84 works			2

@entity0 broke her tibia and foot in a nightclub accident in 2011
she had a year of sticking to conventional treatment with limited success
so took controversial holistic therapy at the @entity76 clinic in @entity80
one of the few centres in the world to offer @entity84
it is a controversial technique that uses injection of embryonic stem cells from animals
