by @entity0 published : 20:04 est , 15 june 2013 updated : 03:24 est , 17 june 2013 watching @entity1 after school was a rite of passage for generations of children who dreamed of being awarded one of the show 's iconic badges			0
but now the days of learning to make toys and games using ‘ sticky - back plastic ’ and toilet rolls appear to be on the way out			0
the numbers watching the show have fallen by two - thirds since it was relegated from @entity17 to the @entity20 ’s ’ dedicated children ’s channel @entity18 last year			1
hugely popular : @entity21 , @entity22 and @entity23 in the early 1970s losing its appeal : the show 's current presenters @entity28 and @entity29 @entity1 , which was once watched by eight million and celebrates 50 years of handing out its iconic badge today , now attracts an average audience of just 100,000 viewers			1
this compares to more than 340,000 who tuned in for each episode in 2012 when it was still being shown on the @entity17 ’s main channel			2
the decision to drop the much - loved show from @entity17 sparked controversy at the time			1
filming had already moved from @entity42 , the @entity43 home of @entity1 ’s famous garden , to @entity45 , and critics claimed the show was being watered - down			2
last year the programme , which first aired in 1958 , was also cut to just one show per week hosted by two presenters			0
it has previously had four presenters and was broadcast three times a week			0
last night , @entity22 , 76 , who presented the show for a decade from 1962 , told @entity55 : ‘ i have n’t understood many of the decisions the @entity17 has made in the past few years – including the move to @entity45			1
‘ it is sad but all good things come to an end eventually and maybe it ’s finally time to say that @entity1 has had its day			2
@entity63 : former presenter @entity22 , centre , suggested it may be time for @entity1 to end ‘ everyone has such fond memories of the show but i just think kids have got so many other things to distract them these days			1
’ @entity71 , 59 , who was a @entity1 presenter for five years over two spells in the 1980s , added : ‘ @entity1 was the first programme that had this wonderful idea of interaction – it was n’t about phoning a telephone line to give a quid to @entity78			0
the show was interacting with children with its appeals			0
’ the @entity17 sparked controversy in december 2011 when it announced that @entity1 , now presented by @entity29 and @entity28 , would be aired first on @entity18 and then repeated on @entity17 a day later			1
@entity20 risked further fury by stopping screening repeats on @entity17 altogether last year			2
last night a @entity17 spokeswoman said that only 57,000 children aged six to 12 watched the show when it was aired on @entity17 , but now it is screened on @entity18 more children in that age group watch it			1
she said : ‘ far from being in decline , @entity1 is growing in popularity with children and we ’re delighted by its success			0
‘ and children are finding even more ways to interact with the show – 80,000 visit the website each week and we receive about 2,000 letters and emails every week			0

show was once watched by eight million - now averages just 100,000
decision to drop it from @entity17 sparked controversy at the time
today is 50th *anniversary* of famous badge
former presenter @entity22 *admits* it could be time for it to end
