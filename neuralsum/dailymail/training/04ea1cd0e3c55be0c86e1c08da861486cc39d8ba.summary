by @entity0 we ’ve had phone cases that double up as tasers , @entity5 knives and even edible cases made from rice - but the latest design is much more practical , and could save your life			0
the @entity12 case , from @entity14 firm @entity13 , has been fitted with monitoring sensors that measure a number of key health vitals			1
it tracks blood pressure , electrocardiography ( @entity21 ) , heart rate , blood oxygen , temperature and lung functions with what the company calls a ‘ high level of accuracy ’ - and the measurements can be shared			1
the @entity12 case , pictured , is fitted with monitoring sensors that measure a number of key health vitals			1
it tracks blood pressure , electrocardiography ( @entity21 ) , heart rate , blood oxygen , temperature and lung functions with what the company calls a ' high level of accuracy ' - and the measurements can be shared ‘ fast and easy - to - use , @entity46 empowers people to track key data , improve awareness of their body ’s state and make more informed lifestyle choices , ’ explained @entity44 ’s founder and ceo @entity45			1
‘ over the last two years , we have focused our efforts on coming up with a technologically advanced tool to help people monitor their health			0
@entity45 described @entity59 as ‘ a not - so - small engineering feat in microelectronics , nanosensors , imaging , data analytics and design			0
’ measurements are taken by holding two fingers and thumbs over the four sensors on the back and side of the case			2
blood pressure : @entity46 gives a blood pressure reading , it also gives multiple readings so users can track any patterns that cause spikes or dips			1
@entity21 : the case takes an @entity21 reading without wires			2
an ecg is a mapping of electrical signals from the heart			1
heart rate : @entity46 keeps track of a user 's heart rate or pulse			1
a pulse provides clues to the state of a person 's fitness , potential heart problems or other illnesses			0
blood oxygen : the case helps measure the amount of oxygen being used to pump blood around a body			1
temperature : the sensors read a person 's body temperature from their fingers			2
this is used to monitor a fever , for example			0
lung function : @entity59 reads how much air a user inhales and exhales , which may point towards possible obstructions or underlying conditions			2
these sensors measure all the vital health signs and record them on the @entity12 app. the results appear ‘ within seconds			1
’ these measurements can be shared with family members and doctors , for example , or used to plot changes in health over time			0
‘ all too often , health problems go undetected until they are too late to address , ’ continued @entity45			0
measurements are taken by holding two fingers and thumbs over the four sensors on the back and side of the case , pictured			2
these sensors measure all the vital health signs and record them on the @entity12 app. the results appear ' within seconds ' the case , pictured , will cost £ 120 in the @entity142 and $ 199 in the @entity145 @entity144 shipments will arrive in @entity146 , but @entity145 shipments will be delayed until @entity148 pending @entity150 approval ‘ we believe that through improved self - awareness of key vitals , technology could very easily reduce the incidence and impact of a wide range of illnesses and diseases			1
‘ @entity46 also connects with other health and fitness devices , such as pedometers , to help identify how different behaviours affect a person ’s health			0
the data can additionally be accessed remotely on a web browser , meaning if a friend or relative is having a health problem , users can keep an eye on them from miles away			0
@entity46 will cost £ 120 in the @entity142 , € 145 in @entity144 and $ 199 in the @entity145 a tricorder is a scanning device used by @entity178 personnel in the @entity180 universe			1
there are two variations ; a regular ( engineering ) tricorder , pictured here being used by @entity185 , played by @entity186 , and a medical tricorder it is expected to ship in summer across @entity144 , @entity190 and @entity191 , but @entity145 shipments will be delayed until @entity148 pending @entity150 approval			1
the technology is similar to the tricorder scanning device used by @entity178 personnel in the @entity180 universe			0
there are two variations ; a regular ( engineering ) tricorder and a medical tricorder			0
another device , called the @entity200 , pictured , works in a similar way to the @entity180 tricorder , and @entity204 's @entity12 case			2
it is held on a person 's temple for 10 seconds			0
built - in sensors then establish body temperature , heart rate , blood oxygen levels and more medical tricorders are used to scan a patient , either in a ‘ sick bay ’ on a star ship , or during an away mission			1
the advanced scanning tool can determine a patient ’s medical status and readings , and allows doctors to quickly and easily diagnose their condition without an intensive or invasion examination			0
another device , called the @entity200 , works in a similar way to the @entity180 tricorder , and @entity204 's @entity12 case			2

built - in sensors then establish body temperature , heart rate , blood oxygen levels and more .			1

the @entity12 case is *due* to ship in summer across @entity144 , @entity190 and @entity191
it is fitted with four sensors - two on the rear and two on the side
these sensors measure blood pressure , heart rate , blood oxygen , temperature , lung function and stress levels
@entity46 also maps electrical signals from the heart , known as @entity21 readings
the case will cost £ 120 in the @entity142 , € 145 in @entity144 and $ 199 in the @entity145
@entity145 shipments will be delayed until @entity148 pending @entity150 approval
