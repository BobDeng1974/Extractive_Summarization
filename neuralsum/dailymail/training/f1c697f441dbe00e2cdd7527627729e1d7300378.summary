i doubt that @entity1 will be saying anything to @entity3 again on court in a hurry			1
his brief few words as they changed over at the end of the first set created the perfect double whammy — it did him as much harm as it did @entity3 good			2
i am aware that i said prior to the match that @entity3 should not let this get personal , but the fact is the timing of @entity1 ’s remark was so perfect for @entity3 — and disastrous from the @entity19 ’s point of view — that it swung the match around			1
both players had invested so much in the first set , which was over an hour - and - a - quarter of really hard tennis , that it was massive for @entity1 to win it			2
@entity1 stares at his opponent @entity3 during their tense @entity28 semi-final you can be sure that he will have been pumped and his opponent deflated , especially as @entity3 knew he had chances to take it			1
i was surprised that @entity1 initiated it because confrontation is not really in his character and his level completely dropped afterwards			2
he virtually donated the next two games and lost 16 out of the next 20 points			0
@entity3 celebrates victory against @entity1 ( left ) and acknowledges coach @entity41 's role ( right ) as for @entity3 , the incident just helped him forget those 76 long minutes after which he had ended up with nothing			1
instead of being down on himself he got fired up all over again and started playing more positively , especially on his forehand side			0
he rode this momentum all the way through the next two sets and , as i predicted beforehand , ended up winning in four			0
it was not a big altercation but the key thing was that it suited @entity3 ’s personality while it did not suit @entity54 at all			0
@entity3 had actually been as emotional for a first set as i recall , so he was up for this from the start			0
he could have faded after that lost tiebreak but his opponent unwittingly ensured that it did not happen			0
@entity1 looks in the zone after taking the first set on a tie - break against @entity3 on thursday however @entity1 floundered after the first set to fall to a 6 - 7 ( 6 - 8 ) , 6 - 0 , 6 - 3 , 7 - 5 defeat to @entity3			1

@entity3 beat @entity1 6 - 7 ( 6 - 8 ) , 6 - 0 , 6 - 3 , 7 - 5 in the semi-final
their @entity28 semi-final was filled with several moments of tension
the @entity71 has now reached his fourth @entity28 final
@entity3 will face either @entity74 or @entity75 on *sunday*
