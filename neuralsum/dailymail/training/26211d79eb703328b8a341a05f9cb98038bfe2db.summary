by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 09:33 est , 12 december 2013 updated : 10:15 est , 12 december 2013 revolution : @entity4 mp @entity3 said attitudes in society towards working parents had to change working mothers are seen as ‘ scatty clock - watchers ’ who are given a bad name by out - of - date sitcoms , a @entity4 frontbencher has warned			1
@entity3 said attitudes had to change because the days of dad working while mum ' stays at home bringing up the kids ' are long gone			1
the shadow childcare minister said she wanted to ‘ bust the myth ’ of working parents as unreliable employees			1
miss @entity3 , who recently returned to @entity22 from maternity leave , called for a revolution in the way employers and colleagues view working parents			1
she said attitudes will not change while there is just one mother in the @entity31			2
and she complained that the depiction of mothers on television has not changed since the 1970s , when the sitcom @entity36 featured the frustrated , culinary - challenged housewife @entity37 , played by @entity38			2
mothers are wrongly seen as unfocussed employees who take too much time off while fathers have requests for leave rejected , she said			2
in her first speech since taking the role in @entity48 ’s reshuffle , she said society must value the contribution parents make in the workplace			0
‘ they too often get a raw deal and suffer from prejudice			0
too often working parents are given a bad name at work : seen as not focused on the job or having to leave early or take time off			1
‘ i want to bust this myth			0
i want to champion working parents , particularly working mums , and i want business and other organisations to join me			2
‘ far from being scatty and clock - watching , working mums have done a day ’s work before they leave the house - we do n’t waste a minute of our day			1
’ stereotype : the way that mothers are depicted on tv has not changed since the 1970s sitcom @entity36 , starring @entity38 and @entity75 , @entity76 ( far left ) and @entity77 ( far right ) , miss @entity3 said the gap between what men and women earn in work has widened for the first time in five years , new figures show			1
full - time men now earn 10 per cent more than their female colleagues , but including all employees the gap has risen 19.6 per cent to 19.7 per cent			1
unions seized on the figures as proof that years of ‘ slow , steady progress ’ on pay equality was being eroded			1
full - time pay for men increased by 1.8 per cent to £ 556 a week and went up by 2.2 per cent for women to £ 459			1
working mothers are ‘ highly productive ’ and ‘ loyal and creative employees ’ , she added			2
‘ we should be celebrating , not berating , the role parents play in the workforce and in society			0
‘ this is a job for all of us			0
it is shocking that there is only one mum in @entity107 's cabinet , and the depiction of mums on the tv has n’t moved on much from @entity38 's character @entity112 in @entity36			0
‘ that ’s why we need more working mums in positions of power and culturally to reflect the positive contribution we make			0
’ childcare for working parents has become a major political battleground , with all the main parties claiming to be on the side of families			1
@entity4 has promised to extend free childcare for three and four year olds with working parents from 15 to 25 hours			1
it would also guarantee childcare before and after school for primary school age children			0
meanwhile the coalition is offering free childcare for two - year - olds from the poorest households , and will a tax break worth £ 1,200 off the cost of childcare			1
mr @entity107 surprised the @entity136 yesterday when he revealed that matertnity pay will be included in the new cap on total welfare spending			0
the @entity140 scrambled to say that if @entity143 ’s benefits bill breached the new cap , likely to be around £ 100billion , maternity pay would be the last thing to be touched			0
but in last year 's @entity147 mr @entity146 announced that maternity pay would be uprated by just one per cent , instead of in line with inflation , in a move dubbed the ' @entity152 '			2
myth : miss @entity3 said she wanted to change the idea that working mothers were unfocussed , scatty employees who kept taking time off miss @entity3 added : ' gone are the days of dad working while mum stays at home bringing up the kids			1
while this is the choice of some , it is not the reality for the majority			0
' my generation of women expected that we could ' have it all ' but we are all too often still having to choose between career and motherhood , and being plagued by guilt whichever path we take			0
there remains an impenetrable glass ceiling for working mums			0
' i want my daughter ’s generation to be able to have the best of both worlds and to have real choice			0
' so my main message to you today , is that in order for this to be realised we need an ambitious agenda for childcare and family policy			0
' while there ’s been a quiet revolution in the way people live their lives , we now need a childcare revolution to match it '			2
