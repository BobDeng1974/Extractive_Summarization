tackled and chased , not much else			2

clever late passes , nimble running and fine tactical kicking			2

no significant sniping threat @entity81 - 6 made his presence felt in a dominant set piece and also put in some telling tackles but found the ball too slippery at times			1

late fumble in front of the line			2
@entity105 - 5.5 not his greatest game			2
was a typically reliable lineout option but no real carrying impact and some shaky handling in first half			2
@entity111 - 5.5 his first act was to concede a penalty and the @entity115 captain found it hard to impose himself at the breakdown or in open play			0
