by @entity0 published : 07:07 est , 15 june 2012 updated : 11:06 est , 15 june 2012 a three - year - old @entity2 girl who suffered burns to 80 per cent of her body in an accident at a family barbecue is recovering after being given a new layer of ' cloned ' skin			1
doctors did not expect @entity10 to survive after she was seriously injured on @entity11 when a container of fire lighting fluid exploded at her home in @entity15			1
this week , little @entity16 underwent a groundbreaking operation that saw 41 pieces of skin flown in from @entity20 to be grafted onto her back , face , chest , arms and legs			1
groundbreaking : dr @entity27 ( pictured left ) and @entity29 push three - year - old @entity10 into surgery as part of a pioneering procedure , new skin was grown in a laboratory in @entity35 , @entity36 , using cells harvested from @entity16 's body			1
' everything went quite smoothly , ' said dr @entity27 , a plastic and reconstructive surgeon who performed the surgery on @entity16 in a @entity15 hospital			1
dr @entity42 said he did not hold out much hope for the toddler 's survival when he first met her in january			0
' she had swelled to three times her size from her injuries , ' he said			0
under the knife : anaesthetist @entity49 ( pictured left ) checks @entity50 during her pioneering surgery @entity16 has been in hospital since being admitted in january and during that time has battled pneumonia and kidney failure , as well as suffering several cardiac arrests			2
doctors finally stabilised her so that this week 's complex skin transplant surgery could be carried out			2
dr @entity42 and his team used enough skin during the surgery to cover a mat and stapled it in pieces onto @entity16 's wounds			1
on her face , doctors used absorbent stitch material instead of staples			2
the new skin had been created by cloning two samples of skin taken from one of the few parts of @entity16 's body that escaped injury thanks to a diaper she was wearing at the time of the accident			1
anxious : @entity79 suffered burns to 80 per cent of her body after an accident at a barbeque at her home in @entity15 , @entity2 the samples were sent to @entity87 laboratory in @entity35 where the skin was ' cloned ' using mouse cells as a ' scaffold '			1
the procedure has been used many times in @entity20 and @entity93 , but rarely in @entity2 , dr @entity42 said			1
on monday evening , a special courier arrived from @entity35 with a stainless steel container carrying about 30 to 40 grafts of @entity16 's new skin			1
thin , delicate and almost transparent , the skin was taken to a @entity15 hospital by ambulance from the airport			1
the skin needed to be grafted onto @entity16 within 24 hours of leaving the laboratory			1
' it was like clockwork the way the skin arrived on time , ' said dr @entity42			0
hoping for a quick recovery : @entity50 's parents @entity110 and @entity29 shown with son @entity112 as @entity16 was wheeled out of the surgery , her father @entity113 expressed his relief to reporters			1
' everything looks great - it 's fantastic , ' he said			0
the little girl 's mother , @entity29 , who has been by her daughter 's bedside since the accident , looked equally relieved			0
for a week after the operation , @entity16 will be wrapped in foam and protective dressing			1
she faces two immediate challenges			0
the first is ensuring that she remains free of infection			0
the second challenge is to prevent the new skin from sliding off and not taking			0
skin grafts are delicate and prone to tearing			0
doctors will have to keep @entity10 sedated to minimise the risk of tearing			2
@entity135 , founder of the @entity136 , a local charity dedicated to providing medical treatments for young burn survivors , considers @entity16 to be one of the luckier burn victims			2
she said survival in @entity2 often depends on victims ' proximity to a hospital and whether they are properly equipped			2
while there are no reliable statistics , ms @entity135 estimates that around 15,000 children are seriously injured every year			0
in impoverished areas , the use of candles , paraffin stoves and open fires are often the causes of fire , particularly during the winter months			0
@entity157 , in the @entity156 province of @entity2 , currently has 12 children in their burns unit			0
in the case of @entity16 , access to medical care at an early stage as well as her parent 's ability to raise money through social networking sites have all helped ease the burden			0
dr @entity42 will be able to tell whether the skin has successfully taken after two weeks but he is optimistic given @entity10 's determination			2
' she is a fighter , ' he said .			0

doctors did not expect little @entity10 ' @entity16 ' @entity113 to survive after the *horrific* accident at a family barbecue in @entity15 , @entity2
she underwent a groundbreaking operation that saw 41 pieces of skin flown in from @entity20 and grafted onto her back , face , chest , arms and legs
