the theft of a handwritten letter by the @entity7 master , @entity3 could only have been an inside job , the former head of the @entity2 museums has said			2
the return of two letters stolen from an archive in 1997 , has been offered by a former @entity2 employee for between euro 100,000 ( £ 72,000 ) and 200,000 ( £ 144,000 )			1
the @entity2 authorities discovered that it was missing from the offices of the @entity15 of @entity16 18 years ago but did not publicise the theft			0
the former director of the @entity19 has said the theft of letters written by @entity3 from its archives must have been carried out by ' an inside man '			1
above , a file image of one of its archives former director of the @entity19 , @entity28 , said : ‘ these areas [ of the archive ] are not easy to access			1
' it must have been an inside man working in the archives who knew how to gain possession of the document and be able to get it out without creating havoc			1
’ he said the letter was of ‘ immense ’ value although it would be impossible for thieves to sell			0
‘ every letter by @entity3 is of immense value			0
the loss of any nugget by the great @entity7 masters is serious			0
‘ there is no realistic prospect of a sale ’ , he told @entity49 - based newspaper @entity48			0
but in any case the value of the letter ‘ is difficult to estimate because it depends on ‘ the content , intended recipient , period and the presence or not of signatures , sketches , designs or sonnets			0
’ he said that the letter would probably not have been a family letter but likely referring to art commissioned by the pope			0
‘ it could be on architectural matters or a service note for the acquisition of materials that he needed to complete a work			0
’ mr @entity28 said while the letters could not be sold they were of ' immense value '			1
a former employee has come forward almost 15 years after they were stolen , claiming he knows where they are a nun working in the @entity82 , the body set up by @entity83 in 1506 to maintain the basilica of @entity86 ’s informed the then head - @entity85 of the disappearance in 1997			1

‘ cardinal @entity90 recently received a proposal for the return of the letter in exchange for payment , ” father @entity95 , the @entity96 spokesman , said			1
‘ naturally he refused , as these are documents that have been stolen			2

letters were kept in an area of the archives which few had access to
@entity28 said they must have been *lifted* by ' an inside man '
