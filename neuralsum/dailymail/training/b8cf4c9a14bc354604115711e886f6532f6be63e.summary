@entity7 said he felt ' confident ' and ' capable ' enough to perform the complicated procedure on @entity9 , 32 , at @entity10 , @entity11 , @entity12 , after she was admitted with appendicitis			1
the fifth - year trainee surgeon , who had worked at the hospital for less than three weeks , has admitted making a series of errors and now acknowledges he did not have enough experience when he performed surgery on october 23 , 2011			0
@entity7 ( left ) said he felt ' confident ' and ' capable ' enough to perform the complicated procedure on @entity9 ( right ) , 32 , at @entity10 , @entity11 , @entity12 the mother - of - three died on the operating table 19 days later after suffering a miscarriage and undergoing a second procedure to remove her appendix			1
senior surgical consultant , dr @entity25 , has admitted failing in his role by not attending theatre to carry out the surgery himself or supervising the registrar			1
but his defence barrister , @entity30 , has accused junior surgeons of keeping mr @entity25 ' in the dark ' in order to conduct the ' interesting and rare ' operation themselves			1
both doctors are facing fitness to practise proceedings at the @entity39 in @entity40 , where they could face being struck off the medical register if the panel decide their actions amounted to misconduct			0
in his written statement to the @entity45 , mr @entity7 said he ' felt confident ' but now ' readily acknowledges he was out of his depth '			0
loss : the family of @entity9			2
@entity48 , sons @entity49 ( right ) , @entity52 ( left ) and daughter @entity51 with @entity9 's sister @entity53 giving evidence , the medic added : ' at that time i felt i was capable to do this operation having done so many appendectomies , both supervised and unsupervised - that it 's within my capabilities			1
' clearly this is not the case because i did n't have enough experience to operate on a pregnant woman			2
' the panel has heard that mr @entity25 , the on - duty consultant , was in the coffee room while the surgery took place , but did not know the operation had occurred until he returned to work the next morning			1
dr @entity70 , a fifth - year trainee , had only been at the hospital for three weeks junior medics @entity72 and @entity74 , who are not facing charges , along with mr @entity7 , have been accused of deliberately withholding information from their boss			1
mr @entity30 suggested to mr @entity7 : ' the truth of the matter is not that you did n't need supervision			0
it was really that you did n't want supervision for this operation			2
' you did n't want him to be there did you ? you wanted to do this interesting and rare surgery while unsupervised did n't you ? ' and there was a deliberate decision from the very outset , including you , that mr @entity25 would n't be told what his junior team were doing in this case			1
' mr @entity7 denied the allegation and explained he thought it was his ' duty ' to conduct the operation as he was responsible for conducting emergency surgeries over that weekend			0
he even allowed second - year trainee mr @entity72 to begin the surgery after he asked to help , despite not being on duty and never having operated on a pregnant woman before			0
' it was hard for me to refuse that			0
that help is always required , particularly on weekends because we are thin on weekends , mr @entity7 added			0
the tribunal has heard how mrs @entity9 was admitted to hospital with severe abdominal pain on october 21 , 2011 , and was diagnosed with appendicitis two days later			2
mrs @entity9 , who was 21 - weeks pregnant , was told she needed an appendectomy and was added to mr @entity7 's list			2
during the procedure she began to bleed heavily and ' in the midst ' of the bleeding the medic removed what he thought to be her appendix			0
mrs @entity9 ' condition failed to improve after the mistake was noticed and she died on the operating table at @entity10 , @entity11 , during a second operation 19 days later mrs @entity9 was discharged ten days after the sunday october 23 operation , but returned to the @entity11 hospital on november 7 , still in serious pain			1
another doctor discovered that it was in fact her right ovary that had been removed instead of her appendix			0
she gave birth to a still - born boy and died on the operating table on november 11 following a second operation to remove the organ , the tribunal heard			2
the post-mortem concluded she had died of multiple organ failure brought on by septicaemia , the panel heard			1
mr @entity25 , represented by @entity30 , admits to failing to appropriately undertake his role in not attending or supervising the operation , but denies several other similar charges on the basis that his admission ' renders them redundant '			1
mr @entity7 , represented by @entity145 , has admitted failing to inform the consultant , involving a junior doctor in the operation without having the experience to supervise him and removing the patient 's ovary in error , leaving two outstanding factual matters for the panel to decide			1
the @entity45 do not allege that any of the doctors ' failings led to their patient 's death			0
if the panel , chaired by @entity159 , find any of the facts admitted or found proved amount to misconduct the medics could face sanctions ranging from conditions to erasure from the medical register			0
recording a narrative verdict , an inquest in @entity171 , east @entity168 , coroner @entity167 said a lost window of opportunity could have saved mrs @entity9			0
@entity174 , @entity175 and @entity176 admitted liability for her death apologised to her family			0

@entity70 admits he did n't have experience for complicated procedure
@entity9 died after *botched* operation from multiple organ failure
dr @entity25 admits he should have overseen operation
but senior consultant 's *lawyer* claims junior doctors ' kept him in the dark '
