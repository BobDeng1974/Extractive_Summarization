they see less of @entity1 on the streets of @entity3 now than they used to			1
he no longer plays for @entity6 for a start			2
reinventing himself as @entity11 ’s top scorer , the front - page headlines are also less evident			1
if no one imagines he now spends his days train - spotting , the nights seem a little quieter than they once were			1
@entity1 celebrates scoring his third goal of the afternoon against @entity17 on sunday hat - trick hero @entity1 takes the ball home following his heroics against @entity17 at @entity20 the 24 - year - old ( left ) embraces his manager @entity22 after sunday 's convincing win ‘ @entity1 used to put himself around in the @entity3 area , ’ says @entity24 , his former coach at boys club @entity25			1
‘ not that he was doing anything off limits			2
‘ but i ’ve not spoken to him in a good while			2
before you would see quite a bit of him round here			2
but we do n’t see nearly as much of him now as we used to			2
’ it may be a conscious thing			2
@entity40 the words ‘ @entity1 and controversy ’ in the same search and there are more answers than pubs on @entity44			1
in football people talk and older , wiser colleagues and managers whispered of a player with a reputation for being unmanagable			2
‘ there was never any doubt about the boy ’s ability , ’ says former @entity17 manager @entity53			1
‘ it was the off - field stuff that concerned you			1
he was a young boy when i had him			2
he was quiet , withdrawn at times , and wasn ’ t exactly the life and soul of the dressing room			2
‘ he kept himself to himself - but he could n’t get back to @entity64 quick enough			1
‘ that seemed to be the case any time he got a day off			2
any spare time and he wanted back to @entity3 to be with his mates , which probably was n’t a good thing			0
' i ’m not sure he was doing the right kind of things			0
i ’m sure he is now being guided by the @entity11 management team			1
’ it has taken time , work and effort to get to a point where @entity1 can now boast 14 goals in his last 17 games			1
@entity1 celebrated his hat - trick with a trophy as he became @entity11 's top scorer @entity1 caused a stir when he first arrived at @entity6 but proved to be a fans favourite in the end @entity1 celebrates scoring the winning goal for @entity6 in the @entity89 semi-final in april 2013 as a child , he stood out in @entity64 amateur football			1
but concerns about the impact of his formative years on the company he kept prompted @entity6 , his boyhood idols , to reject his talents			0
‘ it ’s well known he could be a feisty character , ’ recalls @entity24 , a @entity25 committee member			0
‘ i go back with @entity1 to when he was 12 and he was a lad who had to be looked after			1
‘ he came from a split family and you take on the role of social worker in that situation			0
but he was no different from the others in that regard			0
‘ he was like any other young lad			0
he had his troubles with different folk and what not			0
’ ‘ troubles with different folk ’ is a polite way of summing up his career			0
boldly , @entity115 took a gamble on signing him for £ 900,000 in january 2014			1
@entity1 had accumulated yet more front - page cuttings from while on loan at @entity6 from @entity120 following a racism row on social media			1
the doubts over his perceived shortcomings as a human being were amplified when he returned to @entity3 – where else ? – to attend an @entity64 derby as a @entity6 fan			0
he was in a pub where offensive chants about @entity130 and former @entity132 attacker @entity131 were filmed and posted on the internet			0
in october , he will stand trial on offensive behaviour at football			0
when the legal action is concluded one way or the other the @entity137 will revisit charges of bringing the game into disrepute			0
@entity1 was @entity120 leading goalscorer in january of last year , scoring 13 goals in all that attracted interest from @entity11 though , with the @entity149 striker penning a four - year deal with the @entity151 the potential for embarrassment to @entity11 is apparent and , perhaps for that reason , @entity115 ’s successor , @entity22 , appeared to make a judgement the player was n’t worth the hassle			1
he was no one ’s definition of a @entity22 24 - hour athlete			1
yet the @entity163 ’s attitudes to @entity1 began to soften when the player opted to drive three hours to play for @entity11 ’s development team against @entity166 of his own accord			1
within days he was back in the first team , scoring in a 2 - 1 defeat to @entity17 at @entity20			1
in the five months since , he has usurped @entity170 in the starting @entity171 and is now regarded as @entity22 ’s most potent attacker			0
‘ he looks as if he has matured as a player , ’ adds @entity53 , now a scout with @entity166			0
‘ he never wanted to be an out - and - out striker when i had him at @entity17			2
he always drifted out into wide areas			0
‘ he still does that , but i think he has improved			0
his hold - up play and movement is better			2
‘ he is playing with good quality players , getting better service and i am hopeful he has turned a corner now			0
’ @entity182 and @entity6 wanted @entity1 on loan in the last window			1
the court case notwithstanding , however , his no 28 @entity11 shirt looks a better fit now than it did even three months ago			1
‘ he is silencing a few critics now , ’ says his former @entity3 coach @entity24 , with @entity1 having grabbed his second hat - trick of the season against @entity17 on sunday			1
‘ the @entity11 supporters did n’t fancy him much			1
there were certainly a few doubters there			0
‘ people here in this neck of woods was hoping he would end up back at @entity6 on loan			0
‘ i ’m delighted for him it did n’t come to that because i do n’t think it would have been a good move for his career			0
‘ to be honest , i would take him over @entity208 every time			0
‘ he is a better striker			0
i used to see @entity208 a lot when he played for @entity6 and , all round , @entity1 is a better player			1
‘ i read he still has a trial to go through for the pub incident - but he knows now he has to be on his best behaviour			2
you have to be to be a @entity11 player			1
‘ i ’ll tell him that if i see him again in @entity3			0
but it looks to me now like he has turned the corner			0

@entity1 is making the right sort of noise with @entity11
as a youngster @entity1 had his fair share of controversy
then @entity11 manager @entity115 took a gamble signing him last year
@entity1 has been a real success for the @entity151 since - most notably scoring 14 goals in his last 17 games
