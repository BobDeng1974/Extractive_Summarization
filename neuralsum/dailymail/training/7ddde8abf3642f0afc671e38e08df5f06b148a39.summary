@entity1 , emeritus professor of bacteriology at the @entity3 , told @entity4 that ‘ bags - for - life ’ should not be used to carry raw meat or vegetables with soil on them as the bacteria on these products can then be transferred to other foods , such as fruit , that will be consumed without cooking			1
professor @entity1 said : ‘ plastic bags should be used for things like raw meat			1
they should n’t be going into @entity38 or cotton bags , even if they are wrapped , because the outside of their packages carry bacteria			0
‘ @entity45 meats should be separated from the rest of shopping – particularly from unwrapped things that will be eaten raw			0
’ he added that plastic , @entity38 and cotton reusable bags are equally unsuitable for carrying raw meat but that they are fine for transporting products such as boxes of cereal and jars of jam			2
he explained that they can be machine washed to keep them as clean as possible for transporting products other than raw meats			0
but , he said that washing them or using antibacterial sprays is not enough to kill the bacteria transferred to them by raw meat			1
he told @entity4 : ‘ they are really rather difficult to clean			0
if they are looking a bit grotty then they should be thrown away			0
‘ you ca n’t get the bugs out just by washing them – it will get rid of some of the bacteria , but not all of them			0
professor @entity1 said plastic , @entity38 and cotton reusable bags are equally unsuitable for carrying raw meat but that they are fine for transporting products such as boxes of cereal and jars of jam ‘ once you ’ve used a bag for carrying raw meat , you should throw it away			1
’ professor @entity1 's comments come after a study by @entity84 revealed that since @entity88 banned the use of plastic bags in 2007 , hospitalisations and deaths from foodborne illnesses have nearly doubled			1
@entity92 professor , @entity91 , found that eight per cent of reusable shopping bags contain @entity94 and that 97 per cent of people admit to never washing their reusable bags			0

the professor says washing bags that have carried raw meat is not sufficient to make them safe for use			1
he also says using antibacterial sprays will not kill all of the bacteria			2
however , he says it is fine to use ' bags for life ' to carry products such boxes of cereal and jars of jam			0
professor @entity1 says bags used for carrying these items can be machine washed when they start to look ' grotty ' .			2

professor @entity1 , professor of bacteriology , says ' bags - for - life ' should never be used to carry raw meat or vegetables with soil on them
he says bacteria can be transferred from the meat to the bag and then onto other products which are eaten raw - such as fruit - causing food poisoning
says raw meat should be carried in plastic bags which are then *binned*
he *claims* washing the bags or cleaning them with antibacterial sprays is not sufficient to remove the bacteria
