telecom watchdogs are to stop a rip - off that allows mobile phone firms to charge customers to call supposedly free 0800 numbers			1
currently mobile phone companies charge customers up to 20p a minute to dial what are free numbers from a landline phone			1
the net result is that millions of people dialling what should be free services run by the @entity17 , the government and company call centres end up paying hefty charges			1
the charges will end from july 1 under proposals published by the telecoms watchdog , @entity24 , today			1
the changes were fought by the mobile phone networks , which have been making tens of millions of pounds a year from customers calling the numbers			2
in 2013 , the biggest mobile network , @entity37 , even threatened to take legal action to block the move			0
at the time , the company , which is about to be taken over by @entity41 in a deal worth £ 12.5billion , complained getting rid of charges for 0800 numbers was ‘ ill thought out ’ and would ‘ crush an already struggling industry segment ’			1
it argued the change could cost up to £ 57.5 million to implement and that mobile networks would simply put up other charges to make up for any lost income			0
@entity51 , telecoms expert at the price comparison service , @entity53 , said the end to mobile charges to call 0800 numbers was a ‘ long - overdue victory for common - sense ’			1
@entity37 claims the plan is ill thought out and will make an already struggling industry suffer a spokesman for the telecoms price comparison website , broadbandchoices.co.uk , welcomed moves to make the price of calls clearer to consumers			0
he said : ‘ making ‘ 0800 ’ numbers free from all telephones including mobile phones is excellent news since it ’s rarely practical to redial from a landline to avoid charges for what are generally assumed to be ‘ free phone ’ numbers			1
‘ @entity76 cost transparency and simplicity of charging is badly needed in the landline and mobile phone sector			0
we regularly hear from consumers who are confronted with charges on their phone bill that they were unaware of			0
’ the changes are part of a wider shake - up in call charges to non-geographic numbers , which are described by @entity24 as the ‘ biggest overhaul of phone calls in more than a decade ’			1
they are part of a new regime imposing new rules covering the cost of calling the 084 , 087 and 09 numbers used in tv show phone polls , by businesses , gp surgeries and government departments – as well as 118 directory enquiry numbers			2
at the moment , the cost of calling these numbers is mired in confusion with charges varying enormously depending on whether you are using a landline or a mobile phone			0
in future , organisations using these numbers will be required to advertise a single ‘ service charge ’ for dialling them			0
separately , each phone company will apply an ‘ access charge ’ for putting people through			0
consumers will add the two figures together to work out the full cost , which will vary depending on which phone company they are signed to			0
@entity24 and phone companies will be publicising the changes under the banner @entity124 before the switch in the summer			2
the regulator ’s chief executive , @entity128 , said : ‘ in july we ’ll see the biggest changes to phone calls in over a decade , affecting 175 million phone numbers			2
‘ the changes are important for people who enjoy interacting with their favourite shows , but also for everyone calling companies and organisations on 08 , 09 and 118 numbers			2

operators are charging up to 20p a minute - even if 0800 numbers are free
some are important services run by @entity147 and @entity17 departments
@entity24 published proposals to put an end to the rip - off in july
