a @entity1 mp was stunned after a family of millionaire gypsies moved into his mansion after he was late paying back a loan secured on a 20 percent share in his property , and the bank sold it off to the gypsies to recover the debt			1
it meant that the gypsies who snapped up the 20 percent stake in the property in the north - eastern @entity1 city of @entity17 moved into part of it overnight , and since then have allegedly made mp @entity21 's life hell			1
he said : ' it was bought by an 18 - year - old gypsy and his family and nobody seems to be asking where he got the money from to pay the bank			1
' @entity1 mp @entity21 says that a campaign of terror on him is being co-ordinated by @entity31 ( above ) @entity21 claims a family of millionaire gypsies moved into his mansion after he was late paying back a loan secured on a 20 percent share in his property , and the bank sold it off to the gypsies to recover the debt intimidation : members of the gypsy family that have moved in to the mp 's house			1
it 's not clear if all of those pictured have been involved in the alleged campaign of terror and if the 53 - year - old mp was unhappy about seeing the gypsies move into a wing of his property , he was even more unhappy when they started a catalogue of what he describes as terror and intimidation in a bid to get him to move out so they could occupy the rest of the building			1
details of the case were revealed in papers filed by @entity21 at court and with local police from which he also requested protection			1
he said he also made the same request to the minister of internal affairs , @entity74			2
the intimidation included the discovery one morning that the gypsies had made a hole as a grave in his back garden , and warned him that he would soon be filling it			1
the intimidation , it 's claimed , included the discovery one morning that the gypsies had made a hole as a grave in @entity88 's back garden , and warned him that he would soon be filling it violent : alleged ringleader @entity31 was apparently filmed on @entity91 attacking representatives of a car service @entity31 is said to have posted pictures of his son online with what looks like a handgun bragging : @entity31 apparently also posted a picture of his baby covered in money on the internet @entity21 said : ' i feel very much that my life is in danger and that of my wife			1
only last week they told my wife @entity111 it was a shame she was going to die so young			2
and they told my brother danut they would paralyse him and that he should stay away from me			2
' in the past few weeks i 've been threatened with death or i was told i would be left paralysed at least 30 times			2
it is clear they want me to leave the house so they can use the whole building			0
' mp @entity21 said that the grave and the other threats were being coordinated by 18 - year - old gypsy @entity31			1
according to locals his family wanted to name him after @entity128 , but because none of them could spell properly the baby had ended up with the name @entity31			0
the @entity133 that sold the stake in the property has declined to comment on the case			2
there is also currently no investigation as to where the teenager , who apparently has no income , managed to find 37,000 euros ( Â£ 29,000 ) to pay for it			0
he said : ' the police do n't have to look very hard for proof of the intimidation , they are even conducting the campaign online			0
' for example , @entity31 recently posted on @entity149 : ' any beginning has an end , but for some people the end will be tragic			0
' he also posted snaps of his son with what looks like a real handgun and with bundles of cash			0
it is not @entity31 's first brush with the law			0
the 18 - year - old was in the middle of another scandal in march when he attacked the employees of a car service firm with an axe after they asked him why he had crossed into an employee only service area and was rummaging through things			0
even though a complaint by the car firm included cctv images backing up the allegation , the complaint was later withdrawn after the manager suddenly changed their mind and police were forced to drop the matter			0
and last year he reportedly attacked a barber with a knife because he did not like the haircut he got .			0
