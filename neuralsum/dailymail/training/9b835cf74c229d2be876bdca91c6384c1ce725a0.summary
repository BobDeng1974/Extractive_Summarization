by @entity0 @entity1 had his ‘ welcome to @entity2 ’ moment three weeks ago			1
the instant when he realised his life was no longer a private affair			1
like most of what passes for social interaction in @entity10 ’s largest city , it happened late one night in a pub in the centre of town			1
‘ i was outside waiting for a taxi to go home and decided to go into the nearest pub to get a beer , ’ recalled the @entity14			1
‘ i realise now i should n’t do that			1
‘ i was there for 15 minutes and everyone was very friendly			1
people wanted to talk to me about @entity24 and have their picture taken with me and things like that			1
‘ it was okay , you get used to that			1
it ’s fantastic that it ’s so positive			1
people tell me they want me to succeed and the @entity24 supporters have been amazing			1
‘ everyone was very polite — but it was too much			1
’ reality check : @entity1 's reign as @entity24 manager has got off to an eventful start @entity1 is reluctant to cut himself off , but realises now there may be no other way			1
describing himself as a naturally sociable character , he comes across as a man ’s man			1
personable and likeable , he pitches up for press conferences in jeans , eschewing the formal informality of a club training kit			1
as yet , he shows no sign of changing			1
two months into the job there is no wariness of the media			1
no evidence of the @entity60 lobotomy so often performed on @entity2 footballing figures indoctrinated into a life at @entity24 or @entity63			1
a father of twin daughters , his grounded normality is unusual in a working environment where men have been known to lose touch with reality			1
at @entity72 , @entity1 was used to engagement with fans and journalists			1
it was a relaxed and undemanding affair			1
in contrast , @entity24 are a very different animal			1
a club where a degree of detachment is usually encouraged to prevent a manager drowning in the goldfish bowl of @entity2 urban life			2
‘ before , i was working almost automatically - but now i have to push myself to new limits , ’ he admitted			1
saved : @entity24 were thrashed by @entity86 , but retained their @entity88 place on a technicality ‘ that ’s why i am here and i know i can cope with it			1
it has been hard but every day has been fantastic also			2
everywhere i go , it ’s new			2
‘ i do n’t want to find i ’m just spinning around in the washing machine			2
you have to come out of it sometimes to reflect			2
if you are a leader , you need to reflect			2
‘ you need time by yourself to see the next step , and you have to always be a step ahead			2
it ’s been hard in the beginning but , over time , it will become easier			2
’ he made sacrifices to move to @entity2			2
the money is certainly better , which helps			2
but , at 38 , @entity1 finds himself adapting to a new country , a new city , a new working environment to anything he has experienced before			1
all without the foundation and stability provided by his daughters			2
‘ my family have n’t come over , ’ he revealed			2
‘ i am not together with the mother of my children			2
i am single now and my two kids wanted to stay in @entity14			1
‘ they will visit me when they have a vacation and i ’ll go see them whenever there is an international break			2
it ’s been the hardest thing , it ’s very hard			2
‘ but when you do this , you sacrifice everything			2
they wanted me to do this , though , and i could n’t say no. ‘ they knew i ’d regret it for the rest of my life if i did n’t come here			2
but ask any big manager if they made sacrifices and they ’ll all say , “ yes ”			2
this is not a job , it ’s a lifestyle			2
sacrifice : @entity1 left his family behind at home to take the @entity24 job ‘ it ’s 24 hours a day , thinking all the time			1
you can say you ’re going home but you ’re always doing the job , thinking about it in your mind			1
there are so many decisions to make all the time that it has to be that way			2
‘ but with my kids , i asked them what they thought about me coming here , i asked them if it was okay with them			2
they saw in my face , though , that they could n’t say no. i think i manipulated them pretty well … ‘ but they are proud of me , i can see that			0
they are 14 years old and very active , playing handball and football , too			0
their mother is fantastic with them , as well , so i know they will be having a good time			0
’ a more carefree existence , certainly , than their father			0
the opening weeks of @entity1 ’s @entity24 career have been a challenge			1
the doomsday scenario of an early @entity88 exit was a reality until a registration error in @entity180 changed everything			1
there were dark , sleepless nights after the loss to @entity186 ’s champions			1
@entity1 turns a corner in @entity2 and finds the ubiquitous presence of @entity189 everywhere he goes – ‘ people here are unbelievably interested in football ’			1
for days , he could n’t escape the impact of a 6 - 1 aggregate defeat			1
he was forced to find his own ways of relaxing			0
‘ for me , training is important , ’ he said			0
‘ i go out running			0
i also like being with friends and talking with them			0
‘ i have people visiting me at the moment and that ’s good because i ’m a social person			0
i have also got my golf clubs now and have been trying to use them at the course next to where i am staying			0
‘ other than that , i just like to relax and watch television , but that ’s something i have n’t done for seven weeks			0
i also have n’t gone to see a movie			0
’ today , he takes a long - awaited trip to the theatre			1
to the football stadium he wants to fulfil his artistic ambitions for the next few years			0
in the aftermath of his unveiling as manager , the @entity211 had precious little access to @entity216			0
the @entity218 had the run of the place , the pitch was torn up and the football team were displaced , forced to fulfil a pre-season tour more suited to the @entity223			0
on wednesday , @entity1 finally wondered on to the newly - laid pitch and stood in the centre circle surveying his surroundings ahead of his first home game against @entity228 this lunchtime			1
‘ it ’s going to be huge , ’ he admitted			0
‘ i walked into @entity216 for the first time since my press conference on wednesday - it ’s okay to go in there to see what to expect			1
‘ you come to a new country , a new language , a new city			0
‘ you come to a new staff and new players and you have to cope with that			0
‘ everywhere you go is a new place			0
even going to your stadium and playing in front of 60,000 people			0
pleasing : @entity24 won their opening game of the @entity248 campaign 3 - 0 at @entity249 ‘ these things are what you have to prepare for in your mind and be ready for			1
‘ i said many times it ’s my dream ; to play fantastic football against good teams in a full @entity216			0
money is nothing compared to that			0
trophies are nothing compared to that			0
‘ it ’s the ultimate experience and it ’s what i have in my mind			0
‘ wednesday was the first time i have walked on the @entity216 pitch			0
‘ i was in the stands for the @entity269 game last year			1
i had a press conference on my first day			0
but i had n’t been since			0
‘ now i ’m really looking forward to it			0
’ he travelled to @entity272 with football development manager @entity273 to watch @entity228 demolish the home team at @entity275 last sunday			1
he saw nothing to alter some stubbornly held core beliefs			0
‘ we have better players than the other teams , ’ he continued			0
‘ so we do n’t go to @entity216 and just stay back			0
‘ if we do , there is something wrong			0
then you are afraid to lose			0
and i am not afraid to lose			0
“ i would rather lose than play bad football			0
we are talking about @entity216 now			0
’ to call somewhere in @entity10 ‘ home ’ will be a strange , but welcome , sensation			1
an important step on the road to where he wants to be as @entity24 manager			1
‘ there have been some tough weeks here , ’ he admitted			0
‘ but you feel you are living and learning			0
‘ you can sit in automatic mode and do everything in remote control			0
‘ but now i have to push myself to new limits – that ’s why i did this			0
whatever happens here i know i can cope with this now			0
