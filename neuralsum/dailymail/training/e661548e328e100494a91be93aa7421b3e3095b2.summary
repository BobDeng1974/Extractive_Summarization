by @entity0 last updated at 1:38 am on 14th january 2012 it was hailed as the next big thing in cinema but it seems @entity7 ’s @entity6 boom may be over before it really even began			1
film fans fed up with inflated prices and disillusioned by the lack of added value from watching many movies in the format , opted to stick with traditional 2d showings instead			0
little over a fifth of box office sales were for 3d films in 2011 , compared to 27.5 per cent in 2010 , according to new figures from global industry analysts @entity20			1
film fans are shunning 3d screenings and returning to the traditional format it had been expected the 3d trend would soar after the success of @entity27 ’ s epic @entity28 , which made £ 615 million worldwide , with 90 per cent of the audience watching in hd , and the huge popularity of @entity33			1
but after an initial burst of interest it appears @entity7 cinema - goers do n’t feel it represents value for money for every film			2
the major cinema groups charge customers of 3d films up to 41 per cent more than those seeing standard films and many charge an additional £ 1 for the special glasses			1
this means families of four face paying nearly £ 11 more to watch a film in @entity6			1
‘ it is too early to say but it seems that people are being more discerning and making decisions on individual films , rather than simply watching everything in @entity6 , ’ a spokesman for the @entity54 said			2
avatar was a huge hits in the 3d format in the @entity7 in 2010 , grossing 67million avatar and @entity33 were huge hits in the format in the @entity7 in 2010 , grossing 67million and 73.8 million respectively			0
by contrast the only standout 3d hit last year was the final film in the @entity70 and the @entity71 – part 2 , which was the final film in the franchise and grossed 73 million			2
the rest of the @entity6 top five for 2011 , which included @entity76 : on @entity77 , grossed under £ 30 million			1
the research also showed that cinema firms , including @entity80 and @entity81 , charge up to £ 1 per person on top of the ticket price to pay for @entity6 glasses			1
a recent @entity87 poll found that almost half of @entity7 thought the format was ' over-hyped and just a phase			0
' another reason for the slump in interest , is that 2011 saw a rise in the popularity of character - led films in @entity7 such as @entity98 , which made £ 45.7 million , and bridesmaids , which made £ 23 million , and these do not need the special technology			2
@entity103 film critic @entity102 said that consumers have also wised up to the fact that sum of the ' 3d films ' are simply a rip off			2
he has said : ‘ @entity108 has jumped on the @entity6 bandwagon and is driving it hell - for - leather			0
another 3d hit , @entity33 made 73.8m in box office sales ‘ the irony is that many of the 3d movies that cinema - goers are paying over the odds for are n’t really in @entity6 at all			1
’ he pointed to @entity119 ’s @entity118 , which actually on featured just 30 minutes of his concert in that format			0
an additional problem is that some people feel unwell when watching in this format			0
around 10 per cent of the @entity7 population has poor binocular vision , which means it is difficult for them to see 3d effects in movies and video games			0
instead , they see a blurry image , and will suffer headaches , eye strain and even nausea as a result			0
experts do not recommend allowing children under eight to regularly use @entity6 glasses because their eye muscles are still developing			1
@entity143 , pictured is @entity145 's first film shot in @entity6 there are also question marks over whether 3d television will really take off , with some industry figures insisting that until a ' glasses - free , affordable ' option is available it is unlikey to			1
some electronics manufacturers have issued disclaimers to protect themselves from legal claims warning that viewing @entity156 may cause ‘ motion sickness ’ , ‘ disorientation ’ and ‘ eye strain ’			0
last year , sir @entity160 warned 3d television would not take off in @entity7			0
the veteran , whose documentary for @entity164 - was made in the format , insisted it would not become the norm for viewers because it was ‘ too isolating ’			0
instead sir @entity160 said consumers would opt to watch ‘ big events ’ in @entity6 such as @entity173 football matches , the forthcoming @entity174 , or ground - breaking new nature or history shows .			2
