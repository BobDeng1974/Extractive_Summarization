after viewing the painting again with her friend @entity33 last tuesday , they noticed that one of the suffers in the hell scene had musical notes branded on their backside and decided to find out what the butt song from hell might actually sounded like			2
@entity12 spent a half - hour transcribing it into modern notation , and then posted the recording on her blog where it began to get a lot of traffic ; probably because of the unofficial name she gave the 27 - second piece of music			2
‘ i feel like the 500 - year - old @entity51 is a pretty funny name , but it 's not the most academic , ’ she said			1
‘ that 's literally what it is , but in retrospect , i probably should have chosen a little more dignified of a name			0
