by @entity0 blazing star : the @entity2 by @entity3 the first law of fiction is that bad characters are more rewarding than good ones			1
much the same can be said of history : vice is more interesting than virtue			1
the @entity12 , the baddest of bad hats at the wicked court of @entity16 , has always had that appeal			1
good - looking and highly talented , this dandy poet is remembered for wrecking his own life and dying far too young			1
his life was made into a film , @entity22 , starring @entity23 , but attempts at his biography have usually failed because the many anecdotes about his behaviour are often of doubtful provenance , as is his literary oeuvre : any smutty verse of the period is automatically credited to him			1
the @entity22 : @entity23 starred as the dandy @entity12 in the 2004 of the same name @entity3 picks his way with care through this minefield and gives us the most comprehensive portrait of @entity38 yet			1
he also paints a vivid picture of the society of @entity41 , which was wild			2
the 1660s were in some ways like the 1960s — a time of excess in rejoicing , namely at the ending of the killjoy @entity49			2
women behaved with abandon at their liberation , following the example of @entity16 himself			1
his mistresses and illegitimate offspring were legion			2
nicknamed ‘ @entity58 ’ , the king had insatiable appetites for food and sex , which inspired his court , not least @entity38			1
born @entity38 , he was the son of @entity16 ’s most loyal crony during his escape and exile in @entity66			1
@entity67 was rewarded by being made @entity12 , whereupon he died before his friend @entity16 returned home as king			1
the baddest of the bad : the @entity12 was one of the most vice-ridden men of @entity16 's court @entity16 rewarded his son in his stead with a pension of £ 500 a year ( worth £ 40,000 today )			1
next he made him a @entity79 with another stipend and appointed him @entity81 with a lodge to live in			2
@entity38 would have been rich if the emoluments had only been paid regularly			2
but the @entity84 was always short of money , so they were not			2
in addition , @entity38 was a spendthrift , so continually hard up			2
while a teenager , @entity38 had been given an @entity90 degree ( at the age of 14 ) , done the @entity92 for two years , then volunteered for service in the sea wars with @entity95			2
while under fire , he behaved with bravery			2
at 18 he came to court , and by the time he was 20 he had married an heiress , @entity100 , whom he ’d attempted to abduct from her coach after becoming infatuated with her			1
he had been caught and an angry @entity16 sent him briefly to the @entity102 ; @entity100 , however , forgave him			1
@entity38 seems to have loved his wife and their children , but saw little of them at the country house in @entity108 they shared with his mother			2
he was too busy at court			1
he was already a heavy drinker — he once claimed he ’d been continually drunk for five years			2
his drinking companions , including @entity113 , @entity114 , and his best friend @entity115 , called themselves ‘ the @entity116 ’ and ‘ @entity117 ’			2
@entity118 once had dinner with them			2
‘ lord ! what loose , cursed company was this , though full of wit , ’ he told his diary			2
the drunken exploits often ended with the gang doing damage			0
the most notable was the night they got into the @entity130 at @entity131 , where his latest , most expensive timepiece , a chronometer , lay — adorned with glass spheres engraved with royal portraits			0
@entity38 proceeded to smash them to pieces with his sword			0
@entity16 had 14 illegitimate children @entity16 was not amused			1
he was always banishing @entity38 from court , but would send for him again soon afterwards to enjoy his conversation and charm			1
the custom of the wits at court was to write scandalous verses that were circulated by hand in manuscript , like an early version of @entity153 , though much more literate			1
@entity16 was delighted with @entity38 ’s couplet about him that ran : " he never said a foolish thing nor ever did a wise one			1
" he was not so pleased when he read @entity38 ’s satire on @entity16 : " @entity159 he rolls about from whore to whore a merry monarch , scandalous and poor … his sceptre and his p * * * k are of a length and she may sway the one who plays the other			1
" the result was banishment — yet again			0
some of @entity38 ’s verses are so explicit and outspoken as to be shocking even today , when almost anything can be printed			0
unusual courtship : @entity38 became infatuated with @entity100 ( played by @entity173 ) and once attempted to abduct her from her coach he delighted in exposing the naked lust of all classes , including the most respectable			0
he listed them in a ramble in @entity180 , a place of assignation down the centuries			0
but there was a dark side to @entity38 that often turned sexual congress to ashes			0
a ramble ends by cursing women , as do several other poems , which depict them as game for all - comers			1
it would be easy to take him for a misogynist			0
a likely reason for this is the misfortune bestowed on him by his wholesale whoring — an incurable dose of syphilis , which was to kill him			0
‘ i ’ve swived more whores than @entity207 ’s walls e’er knew , ’ he declares			0
‘ i ’ve out - swilled @entity208 , blasphemed @entity209 and libelled @entity210			1
the quickest way to hell ’s by @entity38			0
’ it is not boasting but self - disgust that inspired him			1
monkeying about : @entity38 once declared that all men are knaves , and he 'd rather be a monkey his satires grew more wholesale until they encompassed everyone — a @entity221 declares that all men are knaves , but he ’d rather be a monkey			0
it was with a monkey that he chose to be painted			0
his disillusion with love was complete when he fell for the actress @entity229 , a leading lady of the restoration stage who entertained numerous other lovers			0
he , of all people , hardly had the moral right to complain of infidelity , but it seems to have enraged him			0
by the time she bore him a daughter , the affair was over			0
he did not even go to see the baby , but two years later he abducted the child to be raised with his other children by his uncomplaining wife			0
he took no great part in their upbringing			0
by that time , he was more often absent from the family home and court through illness			1
he must have been well aware that his time was nearly up			0
he sent for a future bishop , @entity250 , with whom he had long , sceptical discussions about @entity209			0
@entity38 could not believe in a heaven or hell , but he did express remorse for his life			1
as dr @entity259 observed : ‘ he blazed out his youth and health in lavish voluptuousness			0
’ the strange thing is that after his death in delirium at the age of 33 , he became more famous than ever because of his deathbed repentance			0
this was announced in a biography published immediately by @entity250			0
@entity3 points out that his penitence rests entirely on the testimony of @entity269 and @entity38 ’s mother @entity270 , who wrote his formal @entity272 ( ‘ i detest and abhor the whole course of my wicked life ’ ) and much more in the same vein			1
@entity38 had signed this in a shaky hand			0
but did he mean , or even know , what it said ? his mother then set about destroying any of his work she could lay her hands on			0
how much we lost we do not know			0
but what remains of his clever , anguished poems is enough to keep his name and talent evergreen .			1

the @entity12 was the baddest of the bad in @entity16 's court
good - looking and talent , the dandy poet is remembered for wrecking his own life and dying far too young
his life inspired the film @entity22 , starring @entity23
