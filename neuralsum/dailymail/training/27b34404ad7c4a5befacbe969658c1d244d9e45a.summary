@entity0 have made an approach to @entity2 ’s @entity4 presenter @entity3 to host their @entity6 football starting next season			1
the inquiry about using @entity9 in midweek to anchor @entity0 ’s marquee sports property will come as a shock to @entity0 ’s main football presenter , @entity12 , who was poached from the @entity2 and is the face of their @entity15 coverage			2
approach : @entity0 wanted @entity2 presenter @entity3 to host midweek @entity6 coverage however , @entity3 turned down the @entity0 offer because terms and conditions could n’t be agreed			1
and working for the subscription channel would have meant renegotiating his @entity2 contract that gives the @entity24 exclusivity on @entity9 ’s services to an @entity27 audience			0
but @entity3 , now established as one of the top tv sports presenters and ranked in the pantheon alongside @entity31 and @entity32 in the 50th anniversary @entity4 documentary to be screened next friday , also has a @entity15 football deal with @entity36 network @entity35 and has done @entity38 commercials for approaching 20 years			1
meanwhile , @entity0 are taking a big risk having new pundit @entity40 pitchside at @entity41 before the game against @entity43 when fans chanting his name might make it difficult for his short , sharp comments to be heard			0
risk : former @entity49 midfielder @entity40 will be pitchside at @entity41 on saturday it did n't go unnoticed between @entity51 and @entity49 players as they queued at an airport departure gate in the @entity36 during pre-season tours that the @entity49 767 jet was a whole lot bigger than the 747 carrying @entity51			2
no wonder , when @entity49 took 130 personnel to the @entity36 — substantially more even than the top - heavy 88 - strong @entity60 party at the @entity61			2
it showed how much the stature of @entity65 football commentators has diminished that the celebrity guests for the first showing of the @entity69 anniversary documentary included @entity70 and @entity71 , who have a combined age of 145			0
but the pair are still far more synonymous with @entity4 than the current crop of anonymous @entity2 football commentators , although @entity76 did feature in the programme			2
@entity79 , the first female commentator on @entity69 , was given the platform to moan about press comment on her unfortunate debut			0
but since @entity79 rightly decided to concentrate on presenting and reporting on radio , no female has emerged as a genuine football commentator in the way the excellent @entity87 has in cricket			0
it would n't fit in with many sports scientists ’ idea of the best post-match recovery meal , but it is understood that @entity93 contacted @entity94 to request six stone - baked pizzas — three chicken , three vegetarian — to be delivered to the away dressing room at @entity98 straight after saturday ’s championship game			1
@entity100 awaits @entity102 call after @entity105 ’s drainage debacle at @entity41 , which wo n’t help their slim chances of being awarded an @entity107 in 2019 , @entity103 chief executive @entity100 is especially keen that nothing should go wrong at the @entity109 during the fifth test			0
the ground is already assured of another @entity107 in its staging agreement , but @entity100 is the current favourite from inside cricket to succeed @entity115 as @entity102 chief executive , although the headhunters are looking outside the game as well			0
with rather less ballyhoo than their self - celebration — @entity122 ’s pundits were ordered to send out anniversary tweets — at covering 200 @entity60 test matches , @entity122 have closed down their online @entity127 service that was once seen as a long - term competitor to @entity129 and @entity130			1
a @entity122 spokesman said : ‘ customers ’ habits evolve over time and a standalone sports radio service is sadly no longer viable			1
we are in the process of consulting with affected staff			0
’ and @entity122 ’s multi-million - pound experiment with @entity141 football is heading straight for the knacker ’s yard as well .			1

@entity4 presenter @entity3 turned down offer because terms and conditions could n't be agreed
@entity93 have ordered six stone - baked pizzas to be delivered to the away dressing room after match at @entity94 on saturday
@entity122 have closed down their online @entity127 service
