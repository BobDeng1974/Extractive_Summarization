by @entity0 published : 06:53 est , 28 october 2013 updated : 10:15 est , 28 october 2013 it 's long been known the surface of @entity3 , a giant moon orbiting around @entity5 , is covered in lakes but now never - before - seen images reveal new clues as to how these lakes may have formed			1
the shots , taken by @entity13 's @entity12 spacecraft , were captured as the moon entered its @entity16 season , meaning the sun was shining down onto its north pole making it possible to capture them for the first time			1
the near - infrared images show bright spots in the northern part of the lakes , suggesting the surface is unique from the rest of @entity3 , which might explain why almost all of the lakes are found in this region			2
this shot shows the outline of the different lakes and bright spots seen in the northern part of the land suggest the surface is unique from the rest of @entity3 the data also suggests parts of @entity3 's lakes and seas may have evaporated to leave behind the @entity3 equivalent of salt flats found on @entity48			1
this evaporated liquid is thought to be made up of chemicals that come from particles in the haze that surrounds @entity3 that have been dissolved in liquid methane			0
@entity3 's lakes , pictured , have distinctive rounded ' cookie - cutter shapes with steep sides '			2
the data suggests parts of @entity3 's seas may have evaporated to leave behind salt flats @entity3 's lakes have distinctive rounded ' cookie - cutter shapes with steep sides '			1
the explanations for how the lakes formed range from the collapse of land following a volcanic eruption to so - called ' karst ' terrain , where liquids on the surface dissolve soluble bedrock			0
although there is one large lake and a few smaller ones near @entity3 's south pole , almost all of @entity3 's lakes surround its north pole			1
@entity12 captured the images during flybys of @entity3 on 10 and 26 july and 12 september			2
these flybys , coupled with the sunlight shining on the north pole and a lack of clouds as the moon entered its @entity16 season gave a much clearer , close - up view			1
' ever since the lakes and seas were discovered , we 've been wondering why they 're concentrated at high northern latitudes , ' said @entity94 , a @entity12 imaging team associate based at the @entity96 in @entity97			2
' seeing that there 's something special about the surface in this region is a big clue to help narrow down the possible explanations			0
' scientists at @entity13 's @entity105 in @entity108 study @entity3 's terrain using @entity12 's visual and infrared mapping spectrometer			1
this mosaic , made from near - infrared images of @entity3 obtained by @entity12 's imaging science subsystem , shows a view from the north pole ( upper middle of mosaic ) down to near the equator at the bottom			1
here , the seas and lakes appear as dark shapes , embedded in some kind of bright terrain @entity3 is @entity5 's largest moon - with a radius of appropriately 1,600 miles ( 2,574 kilometers )			1
it 's bigger than planet @entity128 and is the second - largest moon in the solar system			0
the atmosphere of @entity3 is largely composed of nitrogen ; minor components lead to the formation of methane and ethane clouds and nitrogen - rich organic smog			0
the climate - including wind and rain - creates surface features similar to those on @entity48 , including dunes , rivers , lakes and seas ( probably of liquid methane and ethane ) , and deltas , and is dominated by seasonal weather patterns as on @entity48			0
launched in 1997 , @entity12 has been exploring @entity5 and its series of moons since 2004			2
on @entity5 , a full year is the equivalent to 30 @entity48 years , meaning @entity12 has only been able to observe a third of a @entity5 year			0
since 2004 , @entity5 and its moons have seen the seasons change from northern winter to northern summer			0
@entity12 revealed that @entity3 's surface is shaped by rivers and lakes of liquid ethane and methane ( the main component of natural gas ) , during its initial flybys			1
scientists are interested in @entity3 because its atmosphere is most like that on @entity48			0
@entity3 is said to resemble a frozen version of @entity48 , several billion years ago , before oxygen entered the atmosphere			0
images taken using this visual and infrared mapping spectrometer , which turns infrared colours into colours that can be seen by the human eye , reveal differences in the composition of material around the lakes			0
yet , until now , they have only been able to capture distant or partial views of this area			0
@entity185 , @entity12 project scientist at @entity13 's @entity105 in @entity108 : ' @entity3 's northern lakes region is one of the most @entity48 - like and intriguing in the solar system			1
' we know lakes here change with the seasons			0
now that the sun is shining in the north and we have these wonderful views , we can begin to compare the different data sets and tease out what @entity3 's lakes are doing near the north pole			1
' @entity200 , from the @entity105 added in a blog post : ' the exploration of this amazing place is just beginning			0
frigid and alien , yet also remarkably similar to our own planet , @entity3 is a new world - revealed before our very eyes by the @entity12 and @entity208 spacecraft			2
' ultracold hydrocarbon lakes and seas ( dark shapes ) near the north pole of @entity5 's @entity3 can be seen embedded in some kind of bright surface material in this infrared mosaic from the @entity12 mission			1

@entity13 's @entity12 craft caught the images as it flew by @entity5 's moon , @entity3
photos taken as @entity3 entered @entity16 and the sun shone on its north pole
this gave a never - before - seen *viewpoint* of the lakes and their *depths*
data suggests @entity3 's seas may have evaporated to form these lakes
