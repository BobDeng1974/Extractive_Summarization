by @entity0 the number of people having to submit tax returns has soared to a record high of 10.7million thanks to the government ’s controversial changes to child benefit			2
for the first time , hundreds of thousands of parents who have never had to fill in a self - assessment tax form have been caught in a system that many struggle to understand			1
@entity15 warned nearly 100,000 parents are at risk of a fine of 100 per cent of the amount of child benefit that they have received but are no longer entitled to keep			1
@entity15 said record numbers of parents are being forced to fill in a tax return every year for a parent with three children , this could result in a fine of up to £ 612 , or £ 438 if they have two children or £ 263 for parents with one child			1
in january last year , around 1.1million parents lost all or some of their eligibility for child benefit after the government controversially changed the rules			0
if one or both parents earn more than £ 60,000 , they lost the benefit entirely , while those earning more than £ 50,000 and up to £ 60,000 lost some of the benefit on a sliding scale			0
if they have continued to receive the benefit - which they are allowed to do - they must pay back the amount of money that they are no longer eligible to receive through self - assessment			0
@entity15 said around 461,000 parents opted to stop receiving child benefit while others have registered , or were already registered , for self - assessment			1
@entity15 warned nearly 100,000 parents are at risk of a fine of 100 per cent of the amount of child benefit that they have received but there are still ' just below 100,000 ' parents who are yet to register for self - assessment , an @entity15 spokesman said yesterday			1
the deadline for filing their tax return for the 2012/2013 tax year to repay their child benefit was friday 31 january			0
they will not be fined the standard £ 100 penalty for missing the deadline , but will instead be hit by a ' failure to notify ' penalty because they have not registered for self - assessment			0
parents should have paid back the amount that they received between 7 january 2013 - when the rules were changed - and 5 april 2013 - the last day of the tax year			2
@entity73 , from the @entity72 , said @entity15 had chosen a ' complicated and odd ' way of clawing back the money from parents			1
he called for @entity15 to show leniency towards parents , many of whom will be confused by the new system or not even aware of it			1
mr @entity73 said : ' i think it would be inappropriate for @entity15 to levy the full penalties in this first year until people have really got their head around the situation			2
' @entity15 said it will be writing to all of the 100,000 parents to warn them of the urgent need to complete their tax return			1
the quicker they register for self - assessment , the less likely they are to be hit by a ' failure to notify ' penalty , @entity15 said			2
there were 30 million taxpayers in 2012/2013			0
@entity15 said 10.03million people filed a tax return before deadline day of a total of 10.74million who need to complete one			1
the busiest time was on deadline day when 569,847 people filed their tax return , but 1,566 also found the time on christmas day to send an online tax return			0
the number of people who have to complete a tax return has been increasing rapidly , rising by around 1.4million since the 2006/07 tax year			0
in a sign of the rise of the internet , just 38,000 filed their tax return online in 2001 , compared to 8.5million for the most recent tax year			0
a tax return must be completed by people who owe money to the tax man , typically the self - employed and those with additional earnings or income on top of their main job .			0
