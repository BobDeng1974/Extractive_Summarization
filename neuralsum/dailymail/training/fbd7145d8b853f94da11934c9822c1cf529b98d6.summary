drought in the southwestern @entity1 will deplete the vast @entity2 this week to levels not seen since @entity4 was completed and the reservoir on the @entity6 was filled in the 1930s , federal water managers said tuesday			1
the projected lake level of about 1,080 feet above sea level will be below the level of about 1,082 feet recorded in november 2010 and the 1,083 - foot mark measured in april 1956 during another sustained drought			2
but @entity1 @entity14 regional chief @entity13 said water obligations will be met at least through next year without a key shortage declaration			2
the result will be full deliveries to cities , states , farms and @entity23 tribes in an area that 's home to some 40 million people and the cities of @entity28 , @entity29 and @entity30			1
the lake on tuesday was just under 1,082 feet above sea level , and the reservoir was about 39 percent full , said @entity62 , a bureau spokeswoman in @entity63 , @entity34			0
the dropping level since the reservoir was last full in 1998 , at just under 1,296 feet above sea level , has left as much as 130 feet of distinctive white mineral ' bathtub ring ' on hard rock surfaces surrounding the lake			0
@entity70 said the bureau expects a slight increase in water level to about 1,083 feet by jan. 1 , 2015			0
@entity74 , 30 miles east of @entity28 , is among the federal government 's top tourist attractions			2
it drew some 6.3 million visitors in 2013 , about the same number as the @entity80 in @entity81 bridge to nowhere : this bridge used to lead over water that has since dried up boat launch : this used to be the boat launch at the @entity87 until a lengthy drought lowered lake levels @entity37 : the @entity37 closed last year after no business wanted to operate it tires : tires once used as a breakwater sit at the abandoned @entity37 boaters and swimmers have largely ignored the dropping water levels in a place where splashing in cold fresh water on 100 - plus - degree summer days is a treat			1
but they 've also dealt with marina closures in recent years			0
visitors who used to feed scraps to carp from restaurant deck tables may now need to trek hundreds of yards with sandwiches and beach blankets to enjoy a waterside lunch			0
' we projected this was coming , ' @entity70 said			0
' we are basically where we expected to be , given the dry winters in 2012 and 2013			0
' @entity2 today stores about 10.2 million acre - feet of water and is managed in conjunction with @entity116 , the reservoir farther up the @entity6 near the @entity120 - @entity119 state line			1
@entity70 said @entity116 was at 52 percent capacity , holding about 12.7 million acre - feet of water			2
water officials say an acre - foot is about enough water to supply an average @entity34 household for a year			1
@entity13 compares controlled management of the two largest reservoirs on the @entity6 to pouring tea from one cup to another			0
dried out : this ' no @entity132 ' sign used to be completely submerged until a lengthy drought dried @entity2 restrooms : this pair of restrooms sit on pontoons on the dried lake bed at @entity139 ' @entity140 ' : the white line on the rock shows where the water level used to be deserted : empty boat slips protrude from the dock at the abandoned @entity37 warning : a buoy warning ' no boats ; lies in cracked mud in a dried up @entity2 seven southwestern @entity1 states reap the result under a 1928 allocation agreement that also provides shares of @entity6 water to native american tribes and @entity155			1
@entity28 , with more than 2 million residents and about 40 million tourists a year , is almost completely dependent on @entity2 for drinking water			1
federal and state water officials have negotiated plans for a shortage declaration triggering delivery cuts to @entity34 and @entity119 if annual projections for the @entity2 water level drop below a 1,075 foot elevation			1
that projection is based on data being compiled by the @entity14			0
@entity70 said the 1,075 - foot trigger point is not expected this year or next			0
but last year , after back - to - back driest years in a century , federal water managers gave @entity119 and @entity34 a 50 - 50 chance of having water deliveries cut in 2016			1
@entity173 , @entity6 , @entity120 , @entity155 and @entity174 would n't see direct cuts in their share of river water , but officials have acknowledged there would be ripple effects .			2

drought will deplete the vast @entity2 this week to levels not seen since @entity4 was completed and the reservoir on the @entity6 was filled in the 1930s
the low water levels is the result of a 14 - year drought in the @entity190
experts say the water levels will be enough to supply water to places like @entity28 , @entity29 and @entity30 for at least one more year
