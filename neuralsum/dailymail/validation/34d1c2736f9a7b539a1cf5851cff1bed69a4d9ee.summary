examples included : - a timetable clash that meant several candidates sat an @entity47 paper in the morning when it was officially scheduled for the afternoon , allowing a teacher to enter the exam hall , look at the paper and pass information to candidates taking the test later ; - a member of staff who was in the exam room during a gcse geography paper suggesting possible answers to pupils when they raised their hands ; - a number of candidates who admitted they had been given information about a confidential gcse @entity66 question papers by the head of the exam centre ; - a teacher who had made additions in pencil to a number of supposedly completed ' high level , controlled ' science assessments and returned the answers to the pupils so they could make corrections , which they did in different coloured pens ; - a teacher conducting a gcse @entity83 speaking test who was heard on the official recording whispering words in @entity83 to the candidate and , presumably in an attempt to hide the cheating , pausing the recorder a number of times , in breach of the rules			1
