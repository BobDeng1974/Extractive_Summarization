he 's a decade off being able to drink it but that has n't stopped a @entity4 sixth - grader from developing a way to brew beer in space			1
@entity8 , 11 , will soon get the chance to test his method , after he beat nearly 4,000 students to win a @entity12 for @entity14 and space science education competition recently			1

beer : @entity8 , 11 , is a decade off being able to drink it but that has n't stopped a @entity4 sixth - grader from developing a way to brew beer in space she added , in an interview with @entity29 : ' he got a book for @entity31 that was about weird facts and explains how in the @entity34 they used to drink beer because it was purer than water			1
' while astronauts might find kicking back with a cold one after a day 's work in space refreshing , @entity8 said his idea was beneficial for ' both medical and survival reasons , and it is fairly easy to conduct with limited human interactions			1
' the @entity43 sponsored the competition as part of the @entity46 , which strives to inspire the next generation of @entity49 's scientists and engineers			0
eleven proposals , out of 744 submitted by 3,900 students , were selected for the flight and include a range of students from grades 5 to 11			0
science whiz : @entity8 will be given a real research mini-laboratory that is scheduled to fly on the @entity59 in the coming months ' i never expected it to be one of my sixth graders , ' @entity18 told @entity29			2
