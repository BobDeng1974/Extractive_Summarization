a mix of @entity2 - inspired confidence and utmost respect for an opponent that has won five @entity6 summed up the mood in @entity8 as @entity10 ’s team left the @entity12 capital for @entity13 on tuesday morning			1
most @entity8 supporters are aware that @entity13 are not the attacking force they were last season without the injured @entity17 and the departed @entity18			2
but @entity13 's @entity20 haul means they have always been revered at the home of the ten - times trophy winners and ever since the days of @entity23 ’s @entity12 @entity13 there has also be no shortage of affection towards them			0
@entity2 makes his way off @entity8 's plane after arriving at @entity30 @entity2 lost only one game at @entity32 during his time with @entity34 , but never scored @entity8 ’s @entity36 newspaper dedicated a page to an interview with @entity39 , who scored the only goal of the game when @entity13 beat @entity8 in the final in @entity43 in 1981			1
and much was made elsewhere of the fact that @entity8 also lost their other two encounters against @entity13 , 1 - 0 and 4 - 0 in 2009			1
@entity39 is asked at length about @entity47 who @entity8 manager @entity10 equalled last season when he won the @entity20 for the third time			0
@entity51 superstar ronaldo has scored 20 goals for both club and country already this season @entity55 ( left ) and @entity2 ( right ) share a joke as @entity8 arrive at @entity8 airport aside from recalling the wit of his former manager – telling his full - back ‘ they shot the wrong @entity39 in 1963 ’ after one of his poorer performances , @entity39 paid tribute to both men saying			2
‘ there is only one @entity47 but i like @entity10			0
he ’s very astute , he knows how to manage a dressing room and i have a lot of admiration for him			0
' any confidence @entity8 have ahead of the tie is also tempered by the fact that not only have they never beaten @entity13 in @entity75 football they have also never scored against them			1
@entity77 gets up to score @entity13 's winner at the @entity79 in 2009 in the return leg @entity13 then battered @entity8 4 - 0 at @entity32 ; @entity81 celebrates here @entity2 is averaging more than two goals a game in @entity84 at the moment and is certainly on the kind of form to change that but traditionally he has his own problems when he goes to @entity32			1
@entity90 ran with the headline ‘ the @entity92 ’ on monday and told readers that in five visits to @entity13 ’s stadium @entity2 had failed to score , registering only two goals against them at @entity97			2
the dark statistics cloud did have a silver lining however – @entity100 has faced @entity101 twice and failed to score against him			0
for all of @entity13 's history one thing is certain – @entity2 and @entity100 are both in frightening form but in very different senses			0
@entity39 lifts the @entity20 in 1981 after scoring the winner in @entity43 against @entity8 @entity2 never scored at @entity32 , and only scored twice overall against @entity34 's bitter rivals			1

@entity13 and @entity8 have won *15* @entity75 cups between them
but @entity8 have never even scored against their @entity112 opponents
they were beaten 5 - 0 on aggregate in 2009 , and lost the 1981 final in @entity43
@entity2 is currently averaging two goals a game in @entity84
but he never scored at @entity32 in his five games for @entity34
in @entity8 , the newspapers are calling it ' @entity123 '
