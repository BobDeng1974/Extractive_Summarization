scientists have discovered that tiny spherical diamonds could be used to promote bone growth and improve the durability of dental implants			1
the miniscule gems , which are invisible to the human eye , could be used to combat forms of bone loss including osteonecrosis , which is a potentially debilitating disease in which bones break down due to reduced blood flow			1
scientists from the @entity28 and the @entity29 in @entity30 discovered that nanodiamonds - by - products of conventional mining that are four to five nanometers in diameter - could be used as a delivery system for proteins in the mouth as an improved treatment for osteonecrosis			1
the disease affects the jaw and can prevent people from eating and speaking			1
bone loss also occurs next to dental implants , which leads to them becoming loose and uncomfortable , while failure of implants leads to more painful and expensive procedures			0
@entity48 , professor of oral biology and medicine at the @entity51 , led the study published in the @entity53			0
dr @entity48 explained that doctors performing bone repair operations , which are typically costly and time consuming , surgically inset a sponge to administer proteins that promote bone growth such asbone morphogenic protein			0
his team discovered that using nanodiamonds to deliver these proteins could be more effective in administering the proteins as they quickly bind to the bone			1
the unique surface of the diamonds allows the proteins to be delivered more slowly , which may allow the affected area to be treated for a longer period of time			2
furthermore , the nanodiamonds can be administered non-invasively , such as by an injection or even an oral rinse			0

the miniscule gems , which are invisible to the human eye , could be used to combat forms of bone loss including osteonecrosis @entity84 , a phd student at @entity85 , which was also involved in the study , said the scientists have conducted studies in cells and animals			1
she said : ' initial studies indicate that they are well tolerated , which further increases their potential in dental and bone repair applications			0
' dr @entity48 believes that nanodiamonds are versatile platforms			0
he said : ' because they are useful for delivering such a broad range of therapies , nanodiamonds have the potential to impact several other facets of oral , maxillofacial and orthopedic surgery , as well as regenerative medicine			0
' his team previously showed that nanodiamonds are effective at treating multiple forms of cancer in pre-clinical models			0
osteonecrosis can be a side effect of chemotherapy , which is why the group of scientists decided to examine whether nanodiamonds might help treat the bone loss as well			2
results from the new study could pave the way for more research into how nanodiamonds could be used to address different challenges in drug delivery			2
dr no - @entity123 , dean of the @entity51 at @entity28 , said : ' this discovery serves as a foundation for the future of nanotechnology in dentistry , orthopedics and other domains in medicine			2
