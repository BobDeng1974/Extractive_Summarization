published : 19:25 est , 10 july 2013 updated : 03:35 est , 11 july 2013 following fashion slavishly has never been my thing			1
but since my daughter @entity3 told me , about 15 years ago , that i ' must stop wearing those ridiculous jeans ' ( high - waisted , bit baggy , tapering to the ankle - you know the kind of thing ) i 've tried to at least be influenced by current trends			1
@entity3 put me into a pair of straight - legged @entity12 and i was a new woman ; or at least the old one refurbished , like a second - hand armchair			1
there have been many fashions over the past decade or so that have been only too easy and flattering to adopt , from flared trousers to skinny jeans			1
but there comes a point , once over a certain age , when you have to tread very carefully when adopting the latest big thing in @entity24			1
city shorts are a case in point			1
i 'm not going to alert you to my legs ' many faults , but given they do n't even turn a respectable honey colour in the summer , i generally save shorts for holidays and only wear skirts at a comforting mid-knee length			1
the thought of sporting short shorts , no matter how tailored , begs several tricky questions			1
will they have a pocket for my bus pass ? will my bare knees turn blue in the supermarket frozen food section ? can any mature woman wear them without looking like mutton dressed as very young , inappropriately frisky lamb ? but though i may be 67 , i 'm still waiting to wake up feeling like a grown - up , so i decide the only answer is to give them a try			1
@entity54 not so @entity55 boucle shorts , £ 79 , and silk top , £ 74 , jigsaw - online.com ; sandals , £ 59.99 , zara.com i felt rather jolly in these and like both the cut and the material - soft and slightly tweedy			1
if they were just a couple of inches longer i might , just might , be tempted to wear them			2
and as long as you could guarantee me a hot , sunny day - it 's not as if you can slip a cardigan over your legs , is it ? best for : skimming your bottom half thanks to the attractive , giving fabric			2
where i 'd wear them : on holiday or to a low - key barbecue			2
rating : 3/5 polka dot shorts , £ 15 , asos.com ; top , £ 49 , @entity79 at @entity80 , 020 7629 9161 ; cream jacket , £ 175 , jaeger.co.uk ; tights , £ 6 , and heels , £ 19.50 , marksandspencer.com the safety of opaque tights can not only hide many of your leg problems , but turns the wearing of shorts into a layered , funky business			1
smashing , spotty fabric and a cute shape			2
but without the tights ? no way			2
best for : those with complete confidence in their pins			2
where i 'd wear them : to any informal occasion , as long as i 'm safely clad in opaques			2
rating : 1/5 ( without the tights ) flash of red shorts , £ 21 , asos.com ; silk top , £ 189 , @entity107 at @entity80 , 020 7629 9161 ; jacket , £ 360 , theory at @entity80 , as before ; shoes , £ 97 , hobbs.co.uk these are too ' look at me ' to wear in my children 's company			1
i 'm very happy in red or orange of the right shade : this one is uncomfortably brash			0
the cut and feel , though , is pretty good			0
at this price i 'd be tempted , if they came in another colour			0
best for : covering the thighs without looking frumpy			0
where i 'd wear them : topped with a t - shirt on holiday - but not in this colour			0
rating : 2/5 @entity131 @entity132 pale blue shorts , £ 49 , jaeger			1
co.uk ; top , £ 29.99 , and jacket , £ 79.99 , zara.com ; shoes , £ 19.50 , marksandspencer.com i love the colour , soft fabric and pretty , full cut , but they 're too short			0
with a couple more inches i might consider them for holidays , a picnic or barbecue			0
but teamed with this smart jacket , i look like that game of heads , bodies and legs , with mismatched sections making an uneasy whole			0
best for : someone half my age			0
where i 'd wear them : i simply would n't ! rating : 2/5 shorts , £ 162 , @entity163 at my - wardrobe.com ; peplum top , £ 99 , @entity165 at @entity80 , 020 7629 9161 ; belt , £ 39 , @entity168 at @entity80 , as before ; shoes , £ 139 , @entity169 my favourite			1
the touch of stretch in the cotton ( thanks to a hint of @entity176 ) makes them extremely comfortable and the snug fit is flattering			0
the peplum top means even after a large lunch you can get away with the cling over the tummy			0
best for : flattering the legs , at the perfect length			0
where i 'd wear them : business meetings , lunch with friends			0
rating : 4/5 @entity191 is in @entity192 at @entity193 until july 20			0
