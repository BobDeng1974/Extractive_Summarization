in lederhosen and knee - high socks , @entity0 lounges against a tree in a pose more twit than tyrant			1
it is little surprise the @entity8 later banned the absurdly camp woodland snap , calling it ‘ beneath one ’s dignity ’			0
but the rare archive photo , and several other portraits as comical as they are chilling , have been discovered in a @entity15 ’ from the @entity16			2
in lederhosen and knee - high socks , @entity0 lounges against a tree			1
the @entity8 later banned the absurdly camp woodland snap , calling it ‘ beneath one ’s dignity ’ @entity0 seems ill at ease with his hands , squeezing them into his tight lederhosen pockets in one photo , and perching them awkwardly on his hips in another			1
in one ridiculous picture , he tilts his head and tries a mean and moody stare to camera , topped off by a military cap			0
it must have felt better than it looked , for after seeing the portrait , he never wore the cap again			0
in another photo , @entity0 tries to strike a casual - yet - serious pose as he balances on the edge of a log cabin veranda showing off his knobbly knees			1
a snap of him relaxing in a deckchair in a meadow is proof , were it needed , that in those days leaders did not have expert public relations advisers close at hand			0
the theatrical wartime leader ’s personal photographer @entity46 took many of the black and white photos for @entity0 ’s own use			2
but they ended up in the @entity0 fanzine - @entity51 ( @entity53 ) - full of hero worship and pin - up pictures of the @entity8 , published by his fervent henchman @entity56			1
a tattered copy of the magazine was found by a @entity60 soldier in a bombed @entity62 house after the war			1
souvenir - hunting @entity66 private @entity64 , from @entity68 , @entity69 , brought it home along with a @entity62 medal and bayonet			2
now , 70 years later , military historians have had it translated and are about to publish it in @entity60			1
@entity76 gushes : ‘ we who have had the privilege of being able to work with him have come to worship and love him			0
’ he describes the mass - murdering monster as ‘ honest , steadfast and modest ’ displaying ‘ strength and kindness ’ and whose ‘ soul brushed against the stars ’			0
the theatrical wartime leader ’s personal photographer @entity46 took many of the black and white photos for @entity0 ’s own use , but they ended up in the @entity0 fanzine - @entity51 ( @entity53 ) his poetic fawning continues page after page , but the magazine is nonetheless a compelling read thanks to the ludicrous vanity of the @entity8 photos			1
@entity76 was only 18 when he met @entity0 in @entity97 in 1925			2
he quickly moved up the @entity98 ranks through his leadership of the @entity101 students association			0
in 1945 he was tried at @entity102 and sentenced to 20 years in @entity105 - @entity104 prison			0
photographer @entity46 died in 1957			0
he had also introduced @entity0 to his assistant , @entity106 , who became his lover and died with him in 1945			2
translation of the ‘ fanzine ’ was made difficult by it having been buried in the rubble of a bombed house and having suffered water damage			2
but with salvaged illustrations and some replacement photos , it is to be published this month by military experts @entity117 under the title @entity119			1
translator @entity120 said : ‘ the book is typical of the propaganda of the time , with the obvious non-critical acceptance of everything @entity0 was and what he stood for			1
‘ it attempted to present him as a peace - loving man who dearly loved children and was kind to all			0
as we all know , the truth was completely different			0

@entity0 ' fan magazine ' has been discovered and will be published in @entity60
it was found by a @entity60 soldier in a bombed @entity62 house after the war
one propaganda photo shows him in lederhosen and knee - high socks
military experts will this month publish book entitled @entity119 of @entity0
