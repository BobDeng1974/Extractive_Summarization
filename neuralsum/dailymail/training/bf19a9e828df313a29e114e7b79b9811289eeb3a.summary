by @entity0 published : 14:17 est , 20 march 2013 updated : 05:08 est , 21 march 2013 @entity2 's billionaire boss @entity1 has recovered what he believes could be the historic rocket motors that took man to the moon			1
@entity1 funded the expedition to use a robotic submarine to recover the engines from an @entity11 mission from three miles below the surface of the sea			1
the team found and recovered engines - but have so far been unable to confirm which mission they were used on			1
he also runs @entity29 , a rocket firm revealing the find , @entity1 hailed the discovery as an incredible discovery			1
' what an incredible adventure , ' he wrote on the @entity1 site			1
' we are right now onboard the @entity35 headed back to @entity36 after finishing three weeks at sea , working almost 3 miles below the surface			0
' we found so much			2
' we ’ve seen an underwater wonderland – an incredible sculpture garden of twisted @entity42 engines that tells the story of a fiery and violent end , one that serves testament to the @entity46			2
' we photographed many beautiful objects in situ and have now recovered many prime pieces			2
' each piece we bring on deck conjures for me the thousands of engineers who worked together back then to do what for all time had been thought surely impossible			0
' however , much to the teams disappointment , they have so far been unable to identify which mission the rockets were used on			1
it is hoped they could be the @entity42 engines on @entity11 's @entity21 rocket dropped into the @entity23 minutes after they launched astronauts @entity64 , @entity66 and @entity67 on their historic voyage to the moon			1
the turbine from one of the @entity73 rocket motors found by @entity2 's billionaire boss a battered heat exchanger from one of the 1969 missions a rocket nozzle on the seabed , surrounded by fish more than 40 years later , the @entity21 remains the largest and most powerful engine ever built			2
each of its five 12 - foot f - 1 engines is capable of generating about 32 million horsepower , burning 6,000 pounds of rocket grade kerosene and liquid oxygen every second			2
' many of the original serial numbers are missing or partially missing , which is going to make mission identification difficult , ' admitted @entity1			1
' we might see more during restoration			0
' the objects themselves are gorgeous			0
' the team used a @entity97 worked at a depth of more than 14,000 feet , tethered to the mothership ship with fiber optics for data and electric cables transmitting power at more than 4,000 volts			2
' we on the team were often struck by poetic echoes of the lunar missions			2
' the buoyancy of the @entity109 looks every bit like microgravity			0
' the blackness of the horizon , the gray and colorless ocean floor			0
' only the occasional deep sea fish broke the illusion			0
' the team hope to eventually display the motors			2
a gas generator and manifold from one of the rocket motors one of the @entity124 used to hold the components together , pictured on the seabed ' we ’re bringing home enough major components to fashion displays of two flown @entity42 engines , ' @entity127 claimed			2
' the upcoming restoration will stabilize the hardware and prevent further corrosion			0
' we want the hardware to tell its true story , including its 5,000 mile per hour re-entry and subsequent impact with the ocean surface			0
' we ’re excited to get this hardware on display where just maybe it will inspire something amazing			0
' @entity144 hailed the find as historic			0
' nearly one year ago , @entity1 shared with us his plans to recover f - 1 engines that helped power @entity11 astronauts to the moon in the late 1960s and early 1970s , ' said @entity144 administrator @entity151			1
groundbreaking : @entity144 's mighty @entity21 rocket was used to launch the historic @entity153 ' we share the excitement expressed by @entity1 and his team in announcing the recovery of two of the powerful @entity21 first - stage engines from the bottom of the @entity23			1
' this is a historic find and i congratulate the team for its determination and perseverance in the recovery of these important artifacts of our first efforts to send humans beyond @entity171 orbit			0
' we look forward to the restoration of these engines by the @entity1 team and applaud @entity1 's desire to make these historic artifacts available for public display			1
' @entity1 and his colleagues at @entity29 are helping to usher in a new commercial era of space exploration and we are confident our continued collaboration will soon result in private human access to space , creating jobs and driving @entity186 's leadership in innovation and exploration			1
' the f - 1 engines on @entity11 's @entity21 rocket dropped into the @entity23 minutes after they launched astronauts @entity64 , @entity66 and @entity67 on their historic voyage to the moon			1
more than 40 years later , the @entity21 remains the largest and most powerful engine ever built , according to @entity195			0
each of its five 12 - foot f - 1 engines is capable of generating about 32 million horsepower , burning 6,000 pounds of rocket fuel every second			0
@entity1 says on his website that as a five - year - old he watched in amazement as @entity11 launched into space , but a short time ago did he begin to wonder about the rockets			1
' a year or so ago , i started to wonder , with the right team of undersea pros , could we find and potentially recover the @entity42 engines that started mankind 's mission to the moon ? ' @entity1 wrote on his website			1
@entity1 acknowledges the engines belong to @entity144 and hopes that one day they will be displayed at the @entity214 and perhaps at the @entity215 in his native @entity216			1
his statement concludes : ' @entity144 is one of the few institutions i know that can inspire 5 - year - olds			0
' it sure inspired me , and with this endeavor , maybe we can inspire a few more youth to invent and explore			0
' the @entity224 launched @entity64 , @entity66 and @entity67 on their historic voyage to the moon exhibit : a @entity21 like the one used in the launch of @entity153 draws crowds to the @entity231 the @entity153 is @entity1 ' second space - centred project			1
@entity29 , his spaceflight company partially funded by @entity144 , is developing a commercial spaceship capable of flying people to and from the @entity171 's orbit			0
this mission is just the latest in a long line of exploration attempts launched by deep - pocketed adventurers			0
last week film director @entity240 dived to the furthest depths of the @entity242 , while @entity244 founder @entity243 is hoping to start the world 's first commercial ' space airline '			0
inspiring : @entity1 says the @entity11 programme was an inspiration to him when he was a child			1
