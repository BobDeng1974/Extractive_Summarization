by @entity0 published : 10:40 est , 9 december 2013 updated : 10:40 est , 9 december 2013 @entity1 today visited @entity2 to see for himself the extent of flood damage following last week 's huge tidal surge			1
in @entity7 , the prime minister met the residents of homes devastated by a tide which reached the highest level for 60 years			1
dozens of businesses were flooded in @entity7 and nine homes were damaged , despite sea defences which prevented the situation getting worse			1
visit : @entity1 talking to members of the @entity18 during a visit to @entity7 , @entity2 damage : the prime minister with local mp @entity21 in a shop which was flooded last week smaller communities along the north @entity2 coast suffered even more - in the village of @entity27 , three coastal bungalows fell into the sea			1
mr @entity1 , who spent last week touring @entity29 alongside @entity31 business leaders , paid tribute to the emergency services and flood wardens for their response , but said more could be done			1
' these were terrible floods and it was a very difficult event but the resilience of people here in @entity2 must be praised , ' he told locals			1
' the systems worked well , the flood wardens did a brilliant job and the police , fire service , lifeboats and the whole community pulled together			0
' this was a bigger flood than 1953 when 24,000 homes flooded - this time only 1,400 homes were flooded			2
but that 's no help for the people whose homes were flooded this time			0
' concern : mr @entity1 with @entity55 volunteers on the coast at @entity7 , which was affected by the largest tidal surge in @entity31 since 1953 on the waterfront : the prime minister poses with the members of the @entity7 lifeboat crew the prime minister called on insurance companies to pay out promptly , and vowed to ensure that householders had support in restoring their homes			1
' there 's always more to be done and always lessons to be learned , ' mr @entity1 said			2
' whether that 's personal flood defences that householders can put in , new flood defences the government should be funding , or even better working between emergency services and local authorities			2
' you can always do more but , if there had been no defences , some 800,000 homes could have been flooded and that shows how far we 've come			0
' @entity2 mp @entity21 , who has helped launch an appeal to assist those affected , escorted mr @entity1 on his visit to @entity7			1
rescue : mr @entity1 praised the work done by the emergency services during last week 's flooding plea : the prime minister called on insurance companies to pay out promptly for flood damage they visited the @entity96 which lost much of its stock as water levels reached four foot inside the store and the @entity101 pub on the quay front			1
@entity103 , who runs a restaurant above the pub , said : ' the water came up to the window sill and has damaged the walls , the floors , everything			0
' before the tidal surge we did everything we could to protect the place - we had to drive 30 miles to find sandbags because we could n't get hold of any locally			0
' we 're now on the phone constantly to the insurance company , trying to get a pay - out			2
hopefully we 'll reopen this weekend but it wo n't be until march that we can have a full re-fit			0
' chat : mr @entity1 talking to local police officers in @entity7 while drinking a mug of tea taking stock : the prime minister with shop owner @entity127 inspecting the damage in his clothes store @entity130 , who co-ordinates the flood response locally , said one obstacle in preparing for the flood had been a ' cry wolf ' mentally as locals had become accustomed to regular flood warnings			1
' we were going door to door warning people and we were met almost with contempt and derision , ' he added			0
' there is a tendency towards complacency and , while the flood defences here are very good , people need to be aware that they are only part of the protection			0
' the flood has caused a lot of disruption and hardship further along the coast but , if it helps shake that complacency , it could prove a vital wake - up call			0
' mr @entity1 also visited the town 's lifeboat station which was flooded and met rnli crews			2
horror : the scene in @entity27 , where a number of bungalows fell into the sea thanks to the storm surge			0
