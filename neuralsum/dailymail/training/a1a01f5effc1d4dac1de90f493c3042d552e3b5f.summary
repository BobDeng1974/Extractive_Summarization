by @entity0 published : 07:54 est , 23 january 2013 updated : 09:25 est , 23 january 2013 the sister of @entity3 heir @entity2 today said she is increasingly convinced by arguments for decriminalisation of drugs - because wealthy addicts are almost untouchable by the law			1
she said her billionaire brother and his wife were never likely to be imprisoned for their destructive habits and were given easy access to methadone and morphine by psychiatrists			2
@entity19 crack and heroin addicts are generally left alone if they have not committed other crimes , such as drug dealing , she said			2
disturbing : @entity2 and @entity22 ( pictured ) were left to sink into their addiction , said the wealthy man 's sister ' wealthy addicts , gripped by paranoia , eroded by drugs , frantic to keep their supplies flowing , are almost untouchable , ' added ms @entity22			1
' possession alone is unlikely to send you to prison if you are wealthy , because you are deemed unlikely to be dealing			0
' families look on in despair , but the fact is that their addicts already live in a world where drugs are largely decriminalised			0
' in july , her heroin - addict younger brother was arrested after police found the badly decomposed body of his dead wife in the couple 's squalid bedroom at their @entity49 mansion			1
tragic : @entity2 's sister said he and wife @entity22 ( pictured ) were almost untouchable because of their wealth he had banned staff from entering the couple 's ' crack den ' in their otherwise - immaculate £ 70million @entity57 home , claiming his wife was ill. in fact , mrs @entity22 , 48 , had been dead for eight weeks , and her disturbed husband had covered her rotting body with 12 layers of clothes , blankets and plastic , sealed with industrial tape and sprayed with deodorant to mask the smell			1
ms @entity22 , writing in @entity71 today , said that well - off drug addicts like her brother have easy access to large amounts of methadone or morphine from psychiatrists			1
despair : @entity80 said her younger brother already lived in a world where drugs were ' largely decriminalised ' in a statement read out at his wife 's inquest in december , mr @entity2 said he hardly remembered the run - up to his wife 's death because he had been taking prescribed morphine for four years			1
the heir to his family 's £ 4.3billion packaging fortune - and one of @entity95 's richest men - began abusing drugs during several years travelling in @entity97 , after he moved from @entity98 to @entity95 in 1982			0
after one stay in rehab , he relapsed while staying with his sister			0
heartbreakingly , she did not realise what was happening , believing that the plates of rotting food and dirt under his fingernails were just part of who he was - when in fact the dirt was heroin			0
ms @entity22 , who gives away around £ 20million a year to charity , said she does not think the ' heavy hand of the state ' or the ' @entity118 ' does anything to help people like her brother			1
police raided her brother 's mansion several years ago , after he was spotted driving erratically , and kicked in the door of his locked bedroom , said ms @entity22 , publisher of @entity126 and @entity127			2
then a year ago , on @entity128 , she visited her brother while his wife was away , despite having been banned from their house			0
she had heard he was ' not in a good state ' and that mrs @entity22 was seriously concerned about him			1
the bedroom door - still broken from the raid - was locked , and though she knew mr @entity2 could be dead or dying inside , there was little she could do			1
' our only option of outside help at that point was to have him committed , and that , we had learned , was almost impossible , ' she said			0
on july 9 , he was again stopped while driving his red @entity141 sports car erratically - and a warm crack pipe was found in the footwell			0
when police asked where mrs @entity22 was , his eyes welled up as he told them she was in @entity148			1
horrific : mr @entity2 was arrested after police found his wife 's decomposed body in their @entity49 mansion her body was soon after discovered in their bedroom , which was strewn with rubbish and drugs paraphenalia and swarming with flies			1
mr @entity2 's sister @entity159 is married to former @entity161 producer @entity160			2
when they moved into their own @entity165 home in 1997 , it was reportedly the most expensive house ever sold in the capital , at £ 20m , with the second - biggest garden after @entity169			0
today , ms @entity22 called for addiction to be defined as an emotional illness , separately and beyond drug - use			1
she said studies had shown that a ' culture of recovery ' is the best treatment , and addicts who are committed to care have as good a chance of beating their as those who have chosen it			0
her 49 - year - old brother was excused from attending his wife 's inquest in december because he is being treated for drug addiction and a mental breakdown			2
' unable to cope ' : mr @entity2 , one of @entity95 's richest men , was convicted of preventing his wife 's lawful burial he was instead represented by a phalanx of lawyers and public relations officials , led by the prime minister 's older brother , @entity192			1
he was initially arrested on suspicion of murdering his wife , but was convicted of preventing her lawful burial and handed a ten - month suspended jail term			2
mrs @entity22 was found clutching a crack pipe , after her heart - rate soared to six times its normal level			1
her husband said he ' could not face the fact she was dead '			0
in a statement read to the court last month , mr @entity2 revealed that the couple had sunk deep into addiction and barely left his flat			2
he said : ' we both felt that our lives were completely hopeless			0
' the inquest heard police have been unable to discover who supplied her the drugs and her husband said she had ' her own sources '			0
sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			0

wealthy addicts are ' almost untouchable ' , claims @entity80
she said her drug - addled brother and wife @entity22 were **n't** helped by state
' @entity118 ' and readily available methadone do **n't** help , she argues
mr @entity2 was arrested after his spouse was found dead at their mansion
he had covered her badly decomposed body with plastic and clothes
mrs @entity22 , 48 , had been dead for eight weeks after heart rate soared
