by @entity0 @entity1 - a cross between a phone and tablet - have typically divided gadget fans , either they ’re too big , too small or not powerful enough			1
a team of researchers in @entity8 have created a potential solution with a device that changes from a phone to a tablet and a notebook , using a set of screens and hinges			1
the foldable gadget can be made smaller for texting , or larger for reading maps , and can even create a makeshift laptop with a keyboard			2
the individual screens can be used independently or as a single system			1
displays can be folded inwards to form a phone , or outwards to form a tablet - sized device when reading a map , for example in @entity22 , each display tile can act independently or as part of a single system			1
it automatically recognises its shape and changes its graphics to provide different functionality upon shape changes			0
for example , folding two screens into a notebook shape opens up a keyboard on the bottom screen			2
by flattening @entity48 ’s three displays , the user changes view to a @entity50 map that spans all screens			1
shaping @entity48 into a convex globe shows the map in @entity55 view			0
while putting @entity22 into the shape of a 3d building when viewing a map will pick up a @entity60 model of the building and turn the device into an architectural model that can be @entity57 printed			1
called @entity48 , the shape - shifting smartphone lets users open up to three flexible touschscreen displays			1
each screen can be removed so users can fold the device into various shapes			0
@entity72 ’s professor @entity71 and student @entity73 unveiled the @entity22 at this week ’s human - computer interaction conference in @entity75			1
‘ in @entity22 , each display tile can act independently or as part of a single system , ’ said dr. @entity71 , a professor in the @entity76 at @entity77			1
‘ it allows multiple device form factors , providing support for mobile tasks that require large screen real - estate or keyboards - on - demand , while retaining an ultra-compact , ultra-thin and lightweight form factor			1
' @entity48 automatically recognises its shape and changes its graphics to provide different functionality upon these shape changes			0
each screen , pictured , can be removed so users can fold the device into various shapes that range from a notebook shape to a foldout map			1

typically , mobile devices require scrolling or zooming in order to see different parts of a document whereas paper can be folded , detached or combined allowing it to be accessed in multiple parallel forms , explained the research team			0
‘ the development of electronic paper computers that can adopt similar qualities to paper has been an enduring research goal for our team , ’ said dr. @entity71			0
‘ books use folding as both a navigational and space - saving technique , and paper maps have malleable display sizes			0
‘ the @entity48 smartphone adopts folding techniques that makes paper so versatile , and employs them to change views or functionality of a smartphone , as well as alter its screen real - estate in a flexible manner			0

the shape - changing @entity22 device was developed in @entity8
it consists of three screens fixed together using hinges
the individual screens can be used independently or as a single system
displays can be folded inwards to form a phone or @entity201 , or outwards to form a tablet - sized device when watching a film or reading a map
two screens can *additionally* be used in *landscape* mode to mimic a laptop
