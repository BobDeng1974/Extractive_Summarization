by @entity0 last updated at 11:46 pm on 3rd february 2012 desperate families who were talked into selling their homes and then renting them back in order to pay - off mortgage arrears and other debts were conned , the @entity2 watchdog said			1
the @entity8 ( @entity8 ) has issued a damning verdict on the firms behind these ‘ sale and rent back ’ schemes			1
the companies , generally small specialist finance firms , offered to buy the home of a client – generally for around 60 - 70per cent of its true market value			2
the idea was that the family involved would get a lump sum to clear the mortgage and other debts yet still be able to remain in their home paying rent the idea was that the family involved would get a lump sum to clear the mortgage and other debts yet still be able to remain in their home paying rent			2
however , many did not realise that their right to stay could be limited to just five years , while the cash sums involved were often too little to clear their debts and rents were high			0
in a ruling published yesterday , the @entity8 said : ‘ most sale and rent back ( @entity41 ) transactions were either unaffordable or unsuitable and never should have been sold ’			1
the watchdog has effectively shut down the entire industry with immediate effect , while it is investigating bringing legal action against at least one of the firms			2
five companies involved in selling the deals have been ordered to look through their books in order to offer redress , which could include cancelling the contracts , to victims of the scam			0
however , it has emerged that the protection offered by the @entity8 only relates to 61 families who took out sale and rent back ( @entity41 ) schemes since 2009 , which is when the watchdog began regulating the sector			1
by contrast , another 50,000 people who took out the schemes before 2009 could be left high and dry			2
the @entity8 has said they will need to pursue their own claims against the firms involved			1
the @entity8 ( @entity8 ) has issued a damning verdict on the firms behind these ' sale and rent back ' schemes head of the @entity8 ’s mortgage and general insurance supervision , @entity73 ( both correct ) , said : ‘ sale and rent back is often the last resort for struggling homeowners so we expected to see firms treating their customers much better than this report suggests			1
‘ the resulting temporary closure of this market could have been avoided if sale and rent back firms had taken the time to fully understand their regulatory responsibilities and customers ’ needs			1
‘ it seems most were more focussed on their own commercial success rather than the welfare of the customers , with one firm even resorting to fraud			0
’ the @entity8 has found that @entity41 firms did not correctly assess whether the schemes were appropriate or affordable for the people involved			1
customers were not given enough time to consider the agreement			0
the sales processes were inadequate and did not allow firms to gather enough information to properly assess whether it was the best option for the family involved			0
the promotion of the schemes were inaccurate , while the sales staff did not get the necessary training and were not competent			0
a study published by consumer champion , which ? , a year ago found advice to @entity41 customers was ‘ woefully inadequate ’			0
of the 17 advisers across nine firms contacted by which ? money , just two offered acceptable advice			0
which ? chief executive , @entity118 , said : ‘ it ’s welcome news that the @entity8 has taken action to stop people falling prey to shoddy advice from sale and rent back firms			1
‘ we exposed the shortcomings of this market last year , after our own investigation uncovered woefully inadequate advice			0
‘ we now want to see redress for those consumers who have been given poor advice by @entity41 companies , and for this to happen quickly			0
