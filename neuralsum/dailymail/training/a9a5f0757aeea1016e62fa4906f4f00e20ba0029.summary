by @entity0 and @entity1 she said i could : @entity4 tasered his wife several times after she lost a bet about the winner of monday night 's nail biter @entity9 vs. @entity12 game this is the bizarre moment an @entity15 man tasered his wife three times after winning a bet on a football game			1
at last monday 's @entity9 - @entity12 game in a @entity21 bar , @entity4 , 42 , a @entity9 fan , and his wife @entity23 , a @entity12 supporter , decided to make things interesting			1
they agreed that whoever 's team won would be allowed shock the other with a @entity33 , and when the @entity9 won 27 - 20 and the couple walked outside to an alleyway where @entity23 leaned up against the wall ready for her forfeit			1
while she starts the video laughing , after the first shock she collapses to the floor , shielding herself behind a friend 's legs , obviously in pain			2
oblivious to her suffering , @entity4 reaches through the other man 's legs and administers a second shock , before walking around to her side and hitting her again , this time on her thigh			1
deciding she had had enough , @entity23 called the police just after midnight on tuesday who arrested @entity4 for possessing a @entity33 , which is illegal without a licence in @entity21			2
@entity23 also told dispatchers her husband had thrown their dog out of the semi-truck they were sharing as their home and then locked her out too			2
@entity58 , chief of @entity59 , said : ' you just could n't make it up			0
' speaking to @entity63 , he added : ' the taser that he had was a skin contact taser which , if you use it enough times or in the same place , can actually leave burn marks			0
the the subsequent police interview @entity4 told said that they 'd gotten into a fight because she 'd been smoking marijuana in the bathroom at the sports bar			2
his wife , @entity4 told the police , smoked too much of the stuff and it hinders her from keeping a job			1
speaking to @entity63 , @entity94 , a bartender at the @entity95 , said : ' they had a bet between the two of them			0
the loser was supposed to get tasered by the winner			0
' she kind of laughed it off , they videotaped it and everything else			0
i had no inkling at all that the would end up in a altercation at the end of the night			0
' despite the allegations , @entity23 has now dropped all charges against her husband			0
the @entity9 beat the @entity12 27 - 20 last monday night , a fateful result which would lead to @entity23 being shocked			1

@entity4 , 42 , from @entity15 , bet his wife the @entity9 would beat the @entity12
the @entity9 took the game 27 - 20 and @entity4 *claimed* his *prize*
@entity120 is seen laughing as her husband administers the first shock
however after two more hits from the taser she *reported* him to police
