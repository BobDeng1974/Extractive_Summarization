@entity0 is set to announce proposals to penalise jobless families for having more than three children jobless families could be penalised for having more than three children under @entity7 plans for a welfare revolution			1
they could also be kicked off the dole after two years in proposals to be outlined today by the prime minister			1
@entity0 will claim that there is a ‘ welfare gap ’ in @entity13 , where those on the dole have a financial incentive to breed while those in work are forced to stop having children because they simply can not afford to			1
he will float the idea that workshy couples could be penalised by having their income support slashed and additional child benefit stopped if they have more than three children			1
he will also suggest that @entity13 adopts @entity25 ’s tough benefits rules which see the unemployed forced to work and even automatically stripped of payments after two years out of work			1
stressing the virtues of ‘ self reliance ’ , mr @entity0 will say : ‘ quite simply , we have been encouraging working - age people to have children and not work , when we should be enabling working - age people to work and have children			1
so it ’s time we asked some serious questions about the signals we send out through the benefits system			2
‘ yes , this is difficult territory			0
but at a time when so many people are struggling , is n’t it right that we ask whether those in the welfare system are faced with the same kinds of decisions that working people have to wrestle with when they have a child ? ’ but mr @entity0 will reject growing calls to raid universal pensioner benefits , such as free bus passes and tv licences and the winter fuel allowance , which remain popular with the middle class			2
other measures being considered include forcing the unemployed to work for free in exchange for benefits and removing housing benefit from under - 25s , as the prime minister revealed in an interview with @entity61			1
the maximum amount of @entity57 a family can claim could also be slashed from the current limit of £ 25,000 a year			1
@entity66 sources say the prime minister will seek to advance this agenda through the @entity69 , but the reality is that he will meet fierce resistance from the @entity72			0
instead , the measures are likely to form the centrepiece of a @entity7 manifesto at the 2015 election			0
that is more than the average take - home pay of a farm worker and nursery nurse put together			2
‘ we have created a welfare gap in this country – between those living long - term in the welfare system and those outside it			2
this has sent out some incredibly damaging signals			0
that it pays not to work			2
that you are owed something for nothing			0
it created a culture of entitlement			0
’ in 2010 , culture secretary @entity101 provoked a row when he suggested that the workshy should stop having children if they can not afford them , saying the number of children is a ‘ choice ’			2
today mr @entity0 will point out that there are more than 150,000 people who have been claiming @entity111 for over a year who have three or more children and 57,000 who have four or more			1
it remains unclear , however , exactly what ministers would do to ensure a child did not suffer if he or she was the fourth or fifth born			0
one idea is to improve school meals and early years education to the point where the less well - off benefit hugely			1
mr @entity0 will also cite the experience in @entity25 , where people are forced to work for benefits and do not get them indefinitely			1
a no 10 source said such ‘ time - limiting ’ could potentially apply to many benefits			1
‘ @entity0 will say we should look at time limiting benefits			2
in @entity25 they say , “ sorry , you have it for two years and then you ’re on your own ”			1
’ in @entity139 , when benefits claimants were told they would get no handouts after two years on the dole , the number of claims dropped by 57 per cent			1
when that state introduced ‘ workfare ’ schemes to ensure claimants did something useful for their benefits , claims dropped by 80 per cent			2
mr @entity0 ’s decision to float such controversial ideas is likely to lead to claims that he has abandoned the ‘ compassionate conservative ’ mantra with which he won power			1
but he is keen to create clear blue water between the @entity7 and the @entity72 as the @entity69 enters the second half of the @entity154			0
the @entity72 said they would not support the plans but were content with mr @entity0 floating @entity7 ideas			2
work and pensions secretary @entity157 said this morning the housing benefit payment system for under - 25s would probably be restricted rather than eradicated altogether			1
' the details of these , of course , we have to be careful about			0
we have to be sensitive to the different reasons people have housing - people coming out of care , being in difficulties in foster care , ' he told @entity171 's today programme			1
he added : ' he 's ( @entity0 ) looking , quite rightly , at the balance between those families that work and try and do the right things against those families that are n't necessarily working and have understood how to work the system			1
' we want to understand to what degree families realise they can get their children into social housing by getting them out of home			1
' on the question of the number of children in jobless families he said : ' i think it ’s a genuine and reasonable question , and most people out there will want to ask it : it is this issue of fairness – taxpayers are working hard and thinking carefully about how many children they can have , and others who are not in work , do they do the same thing ? ' @entity201 mp , @entity203 ’s work and pensions spokesman , said : ‘ this is a hazy and half - baked plan when we need a serious back - to - work programme for young families			1
’ @entity0 has backed @entity209 ’s plans to scrap gcses and return to rigorous o - level exams at 16			2
the prime minister said he is ‘ right behind ’ the @entity213 , despite abuse from the @entity72			0
senior government sources say the @entity72 hope to strike a deal with mr @entity209 that would see him axe the second part of his plan – a @entity220 - style exam for the 25 per cent of least able pupils			0
full support : @entity0 has thrown his weight behind education secretary @entity209 he may be prepared to abandon the two - tier system in favour of pupils of different abilities sitting different papers of the same exam , in order to achieve the rest of his proposals			0
but mr @entity0 delivered a rebuke to those , such as @entity235 , who say mr @entity209 wants to return education to the 1950s , insisting the government would not put up with sub-standard schools			0
he said : ‘ we just are n’t prepared to put up with second - rate standards in state schools			0
‘ @entity209 has the courage to deliver it and i back him all the way			0
’ the @entity244 is also plotting to axe the national curriculum and have just one nationwide exam board in each subject , to stop companies touting for business on the basis of who has the easiest exam			0
a @entity254 poll found 50 per cent of voters back a return to o - levels , with just 32 per cent opposed			0
some 75 per cent back a single nationwide exam			0
but mr @entity235 says plans to earmark pupils for a simpler or more vocational exam at 14 will be divisive and hold some back			0
mr @entity209 ’s aides were yesterday adamant he would not be compromising			0
‘ we are full steam ahead , ’ one said .			0

families could be removed from the dole after two years
@entity270 will use *speech* to suggest @entity13 follows @entity25 's tough benefits rules
maximum housing benefit could be slashed from current limit of £ 25,000
ideas lead to claims he has abandoned ' compassionate conservative mantra '
' taxpayers think carefully about how many children they can have - those not in work , do they do the same thing ? ' @entity157 said today
