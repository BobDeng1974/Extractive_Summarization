published : 10:23 est , 22 january 2014 updated : 10:41 est , 22 january 2014 this incredible image reveals the world 's biggest wind farm - the @entity4 - seen from space			2
the fascinating photograph taken by @entity9 's @entity8 satellite shows the area 12 miles off the coast of @entity12 and @entity13 in the @entity14			1
each of the 650 482 - ft tall wind turbines are clearly visible as white dots sitting in the silt generated where the @entity14 meets the @entity19			1
pin pricks in the sea : this incredible @entity9 image reveals the world 's biggest wind farm - the @entity4 - from space			2
each of the 650 482 - foot tall wind turbines are clearly visible as white dots sitting in the silt generated where the @entity14 meets the @entity19 the @entity4 is an off - shore wind farm in the @entity14			1
it is located approximately 12 miles ( 20km ) from the @entity12 and @entity13 coasts			1
the farm has a maximum generating power of 630 megawatts , enough to supply as many as 500,000 homes			1
it has been fully operational since 8 april , 2013 and the turbines are spread over 40 square miles with each generator sitting between 2,100 and 3,900ft apart			2
the array is eventually supposed to grow to 95 square miles			0
the @entity4 has a maximum generating power of 630 megawatts , enough to supply as many as 500,000 homes			1
it has been fully operational since april 8 , 2013 and this recently published image was taken 20 days after its launch , showing the massive scale of the site			0
according to @entity9 's @entity46 , the turbines are spread over 40 square miles with each generator sitting between 2,100 and 3,900ft apart			2
each is connected by cables buried under the seafloor , and power is transmitted to two substations offshore and to an onshore station at @entity54 near @entity55 , on the north coast of @entity12			2
with construction operations working out of @entity59 , the array is eventually supposed to grow to 95 square miles			0
the @entity4 ( marked by a white rectangle ) has a maximum generating power of 630 megawatts ] , enough to supply as many as 500,000 homes			1
it has been fully operational since april 8th last year and this recently published image was taken 20 days later showing the massive scale of the site in @entity12 the wind farm sits on two natural sandbanks , with water as deep as 80 feet ( 25m )			0
the site was chosen because of its proximity to onshore electric power infrastructure and because it stays out of the main shipping lanes through the area			0
promoters of the @entity4 project believe that it will reduce annual carbon dioxide emissions by 900,000 tons , equal to the emissions of 300,000 automobiles			0
critics of the project and its second phase are concerned that the wind farm will decimate the population of red - throated divers and other bird species			0
this is not the first time @entity8 8 has taken stunning images of planet earth			0
last year it photographed images of the @entity87 in astonishing detail as well as miniature islands inside @entity90 in the @entity91			0
a new perspective : a mosaic image taken by the @entity8 satellite on october 31 and november 9 last year reveals the @entity87 on breathtaking detail great lake : a cluster of small islands in the far northern reaches of @entity90 were also captured by the @entity101 8 satellite last year			1

photograph taken by @entity8 satellite shows area 12 miles off the coast of @entity12 and @entity13 in the @entity14
each of the 482 - foot tall turbines are visible as dots sitting in silt generated where @entity14 meets the @entity19
@entity4 has maximum generating power of 630 megawatts ( *mw* ) , enough to supply as many as 500,000 homes
