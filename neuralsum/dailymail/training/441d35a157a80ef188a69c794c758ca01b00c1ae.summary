they say that only in adversity can you truly know a man			0
in which case , anyone watching the @entity5 this season must be getting pretty intimate with @entity8			1
just like @entity9 — capable of getting once routinelooking players to perform and win at the elite level , and packed full of explosive , colourful outbursts — @entity8 is iconic in the rise and rise of @entity16 football			1
@entity8 's side have lost seven of their opening 10 games and are one place above the drop zone @entity22 scores the winner from the penalty spot as @entity25 came from behind to beat @entity26 @entity27 celebrates his 31st minute goal for @entity26 at the @entity29 on saturday night not only a gift to @entity26 and their remarkable support , the @entity5 needs to calculate @entity8 ’s worth to their marketing and identity			1
his talent , his achievements and , above all , his @entity16 @entity38 persona have all been a small part of saturday night 's ‘ @entity40 ’ being beamed live to 208 of the 209 @entity42 nations ( with @entity43 missing out as @entity44 was fighting , and beating , @entity45 for the @entity47 crown , he says )			1
@entity27 gave @entity26 the lead on saturday night in @entity49 but @entity22 hit @entity25 ’s late winner from the spot after @entity52 had levelled , leaving @entity8 ’s side sitting third - bottom			1
though football is n’t renowned for its measured analysis of difficult times , it has been confusing and disappointing to see the amount of angst and headscratching involved in assessing the hard times suffered by @entity26 these past few weeks			1
@entity26 are becoming more redundant by the week , with @entity25 ruling @entity16 @entity62 's fans hold a banner reading ' no power for @entity65 ' before their @entity67 clash on tuesday @entity69 manager @entity68 was allowed leeway to argue that the departure of a single player , @entity72 , had set back his project — leaving his team underperforming in both league and @entity76			1
@entity79 , the troubles which @entity8 has had to cope with in the past two seasons dwarf that			1
this season , @entity26 are without one of the top strikers in the world in @entity52			2
that follows the loss — also to @entity25 — of @entity88 - winning scorer @entity87			0
now let ’s ladle on top of that the many months spent without a handful of @entity26 ’s other key players : @entity93 , @entity27 , @entity94 , @entity95 and @entity96			2
it would be the equivalent of @entity99 being stripped of @entity100 , @entity101 , @entity102 , @entity103 and @entity104			0
where the uninitiated have shown least comprehension is in failing to understand that because @entity95 and @entity94 have returned , it does n’t suggest that they are even close to their best form — which is partially why @entity26 , who have rarely dominated in their poor domestic run , keep losing very soft goals			1
@entity8 on tuesday night , before his @entity26 side saw off @entity62 3 - 0 in @entity116 in the @entity67 the form of keeper @entity118 has also been patchy			1
domestically , the absence of @entity52 has been catastrophic but , in the @entity76 , it is just the reverse			0
faced with teams who do not know them inside out , relieved of the burden of expectation that comes with competing for the title with the team which keeps robbing their stars ( @entity25 are now on record as wanting to sign @entity27 this summer ) , @entity26 have been on jet - propelled form			1
top of @entity136 ’s group , they have won all three games , scoring nine and conceding none			0
@entity8 ’s @entity5 bunglers have the best record in the @entity76 — ahead of @entity25 , @entity141 and @entity142			1
one calm voice amidst their painful loss of form has been their former @entity76 - winning coach @entity150 , who said : ‘ even though @entity52 was a big loss for @entity26 , few would have expected them to make this kind of start to the season			1
‘ of course , they had a lengthy injury list , new players needed to be integrated and the players that went to the @entity88 either took time to regain their form or still need time to			0
@entity26 are performing well in the cup competitions but are struggling in the @entity5 , sitting 16th however , i get the impression it is more to do with the fact @entity26 are n’t used to losing			1
they have n’t had a losing streak like this since 2000			0
’ nor is the 65 - year - old thrown by , the vast chasm of difference in quality between their @entity169 campaign , which continues this week at home to @entity172 , and their @entity5 work			2
‘ teams performing at contrasting levels in different competitions happens quite a lot , ’ he said			2
‘ you could also point towards it being a psychological problem because @entity26 have nearly always been the better side this season , especially on home soil			2
they just seem to have forgotten how to score goals			0
‘ the players ’ confidence also takes a knock with each defeat			0
then they become too eager to push forward in search of goals and the dilemma becomes bigger			0
’ as serious as @entity8 takes the club ’s predicament , and as hurt as he was by losing his superstars to @entity25 , he has remained sanguine in adversity			2
@entity26 ’s @entity199 has arguably the most boisterous atmosphere of any ground in @entity169 ‘ common sense is my biggest skill , ’ he said			2
‘ to understand life , and to see football as only a part of this , then to help my players understand what happens at a given time on the pitch or during the season			0
‘ players are handled like superstars and sometimes need help to find the right way — and that ’s my job			0
it ’s not wholly important whether you win or lose the last game			0
it ’s about the answers rather than the emotion of the moment			0
‘ there will always be questions and , as a coach , you have to have the answers			0
' bet on @entity8 to find them .			2

@entity8 's @entity26 sit in 16th place in the @entity5
they are performing well in the cup competitions , but league form is awful
just like @entity237 is iconic in the rise and rise of @entity16 football
@entity26 's best chance of getting out of this mess is with @entity8
