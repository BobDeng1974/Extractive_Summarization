by @entity0 published : 11:50 est , 24 june 2012 updated : 12:46 est , 25 june 2012 an islamist who has repeatedly pledged to introduce sharia law was yesterday declared @entity5 ’s first democratically - elected president			2
the @entity6 last night described the election of @entity8 – of the once shadowy banned group , the @entity10 – as ‘ the least bad result ’			1
but his leadership will present the @entity13 with a challenge			2
during his campaign @entity8 vowed to introduce tough religious laws , which raised the spectre of a ban on alcohol and even bikinis on the country ’s beaches			1
@entity8 has been announced as the new president of @entity5 and @entity23 's @entity6 described it ' as the least bad result ' @entity5 @entity10 supporters chant slogans and carry posters with a picture of the newly elected @entity8			1
it reads ' @entity8 , president for @entity5 , revival is the will of the people ' emotional moment : supporters of the @entity10 's presidential candidate @entity8 celebrate in front of his picture at his headquarters in @entity39 today jubilation : the @entity5 capital 's @entity41 is thronged with cheering supporters following the official announcement that @entity8 has won with just under 52 per cent of the vote members of the presidential election campaign of @entity10 's @entity48 celebrate following the announcement of @entity8 in recent months he has sought to tone down his rhetoric , promising to protect @entity5 ’s vital tourism industry			1
however , there are fears the @entity10 ’s hardline traditionalists could hijack his aims			1
thousands packed into @entity39 ’s @entity41 as the @entity58 - educated engineer was named president after gaining 13.2million votes – a share of just over 51 per cent			0
the historic announcement came after weeks of political tension which saw the country ’s military make a grab for power			0
his rival @entity68 , 70 , who was president @entity70 ’s last prime minister , gained 48 per cent			1
@entity5 supporters of presidential candidate @entity8 celebrate with fireworks after the presidential election committee announced @entity8 's victory fireworks tonight in @entity39 's @entity41 as they celebrate the victory of the @entity10 's candidateas they celebrate the new president tens of thousands celebrate the win of @entity8 and fireworks lit up the night sky in @entity41 accidental leader : @entity8 waves to the crowd during a presidential campaign rally in @entity39 last month his supporters were seen crying in the streets as the result was announced			1
but there were scenes of jubilation in @entity41 , the birthplace of the @entity5 revolution			0
people waved flags , danced and set off fire crackers , chanting ‘ @entity99 ’ [ @entity98 is great ] and ‘ @entity5 is free today ! @entity5 is free ! ’ @entity100 , the foreign secretary , congratulated @entity8 , saying : ‘ this is an historic moment for @entity5			1
it will be important for the new government to stand for national unity and reconciliation , to build bridges across @entity5 society and to uphold human rights , including the rights of women and religious minorities , and the rule of law			0
’ the rise of an @entity114 as leader of the @entity118 world ’s most populous state will present a new challenge for the @entity13 which for years counted @entity70 as a staunch ally			0
historically the @entity13 has viewed the @entity10 with suspicion			1
under @entity70 , many of the group ’s members were arrested and persecuted			0
baited breath of thousands : @entity39 extends into the distance behind @entity41 , packed with @entity8 supporters as they await confirmation that their man has won it 's official : @entity131 , head of @entity5 's elections presidential committee , announces the results during a televised press conference today welcoming change : one of the @entity137 faithful rises above the crowd in @entity41 , which was at the heart of the @entity118 nation 's uprising last year the election outcome has alarmed many secular liberals and @entity5 ’s @entity145 minority who fear an @entity147 takeover			1
but there was some relief last night at the result			0
if @entity68 had been awarded victory , there were fears of growing civil unrest			1
a @entity6 source said : ‘ the @entity10 are a different beast from @entity157 , they are not part of any international terror conspiracy			1
we are breathing a sigh of relief			0
it is the least bad result			0
’ @entity8 has also pledged to stick by the camp david peace agreement with @entity166 , but has warned it could be reviewed if @entity166 does not respect the terms of the deal			1
in an effort to reassure @entity5 that the rights of minorities will not be threatened under his rule , @entity8 announced an alliance with leading liberal and revolutionary groups			1
triumphant : women loyal to the @entity10 roar in approval following the announcement close race : @entity8 ( right ) edged out main rival @entity68 ( left ) , a former general fresh start : the square erupts in a riot of red , white and black as word of the official results filters through he has also said he will resign as leader of the @entity48 , the @entity10 ’s political arm , in a gesture signalling he would be a president for all @entity5			1
@entity8 was initially dismissed as uncharismatic and an unlikely winner			1
his success is a measure of the power of the @entity10 movement which is popular among the poor for its record of charity work			1
the win is seen as a victory for the revolution and marks the first time @entity5 has elected a civilian president in 7,000 years			0
‘ the revolution passed an important test , ’ said @entity208 , a spokesman for @entity8 ’s campaign			1
‘ but the road is still long			0
’ the long awaited results came after a tense week of uncertainty overshadowed by a military power grab that has sought to limit the powers of the incoming head of state			0
let down : supporters from the @entity219 camp hear the results as one buries his head in his hands overwhelmed : three @entity224 voters embrace after hearing of their party 's long - awaiting win at the polls bitter defeat : meanwhile , a supporter of @entity68 presses a photograph of the losing candidate to her mouth sickened : a woman in @entity39 clutches her stomach in anguish after learning of @entity68 's loss under a constitutional declaration announced by the army the powers of the new leader have been significantly curtailed			1
the president will not be commander in chief and the army will retain legislative authority until a new parliament is elected			0
@entity8 will now have to battle the military for real power , raising fears of further political tension in @entity5 – and the region – over the coming months			1
the army is expected to hand over power to the president in a ceremony later this week			0
by @entity256 this is a victory which will send shock waves throughout the @entity259 , emboldening @entity147 radicals from @entity261 to @entity262 to persist in their efforts to topple their regimes , and confirming the @entity166 view that the @entity266 has become an @entity118 winter			0
@entity8 , @entity5 ’s new president , is the @entity118 world ’s first elected @entity114 head of state			1
he now rules a nation of 81million people			0
while there is rejoicing among hardline @entity276 supporters in @entity277 tonight , @entity5 liberals and secularists will be bitterly disappointed , especially since it was they , rather than the @entity10 , who toppled @entity70			1
the wealthy cosmopolitan middle - classes will be shuddering inside their villas in @entity39 ’s rich @entity283 suburb			0
a supporter of the @entity10 's @entity8 celebrates at @entity41 in @entity39 yesterday the tears of supporters of @entity68 : this is a victory which will send shock waves throughout the @entity259 although optimists hope that @entity5 will evolve along the lines of @entity292 , which has a moderate @entity147 government , the reality is that it is likely to see protracted strife between a still - powerful military – which has until now held all the power – and a strong @entity114 movement that will make it more like strife - torn @entity299			1
the army have a lot to lose , while the @entity10 has everything to gain			2
@entity8 ’s background is typical of the middle class , academic professionals who dominate the @entity10 ’s leadership			1
he has a doctorate in engineering from the @entity310 , and worked at @entity5 ’s @entity311			0
but he is leader in name only , which is why he is known as the ‘ spare tyre ’			0
he only ran for president after the ruling @entity316 of the @entity317 disqualified 62 - year - old businessman @entity318 , the real strategic mind within the @entity10			2
@entity318 has been in prison four times			0
he and @entity8 represent the conservative strain of the @entity10 , and rule out women and @entity324 ever standing as president			1
they want @entity5 to be run along the lines of @entity328 , where women are covered from head to toe and banned from driving , alcohol is forbidden and sharia law is commonplace			0
the wives of these two men wear the niqab , which covers the face and is unusual in @entity5 – except in areas where the @entity10 ’s huge charitable involvement acts like a chill draught in a room			2
the military , which thanks to its vast grants from the @entity58 still retains considerable power in @entity5 , has made a deal with the @entity10 drastically reducing the new president ’s untested powers			2
in a sense both sides have been engaged in a game of chicken			0
the @entity10 has been using its supporters to flood @entity41 and threatening to unleash its trades unions to paralyse an @entity5 economy already limping along because of the collapse of mass tourism			2
the generals – who could always fill the streets with troops – have issued a decree which restricts what president @entity8 can do			2
@entity8 has no power over budgets , internal affairs or the army , in a country where the defence budget is 40 per cent of revenue			2
he may chair a new @entity370 , but 11 of its 16 members will be serving generals			0
but while the army holds many cards , the military ’s commercial and industrial interests make it highly vulnerable to charges of institutional corruption of the sort that saw the ousting of @entity70 , himself a former air force general			0
fragile peace : in an echo of last year 's turmoil , military police are deployed outside the electoral commission 's offices in @entity39 following the announcement , and it is the military who still hold much of the power since @entity70 went , relations with @entity166 have become far chillier			2
@entity8 is a fervent supporter of @entity166 ’s enemy @entity276 , the @entity5 have cut off deliveries of natural gas to @entity166 , and they ’ve opened the @entity397 border to waves of @entity400 migrants who are causing serious law and order problems for the citizens of @entity404			2
the world can only watch and wait to see if @entity166 reacts – and how this uneasy partnership between the generals and the @entity10 plays out			2
many will be fearful , however , if in time the @entity114 gain the upper hand			0
@entity256 is author of @entity410 , a @entity411			0
