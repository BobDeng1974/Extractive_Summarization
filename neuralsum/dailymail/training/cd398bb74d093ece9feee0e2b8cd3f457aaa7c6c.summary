it was the launchpad for the @entity2 ' unprecedented musical career , demolished in 1973 only to spring up again next door as a working venue once more			1
but now the @entity5 in @entity6 , a famous haunt where the @entity2 played nearly 300 times , is up for sale			1
the club forms part of the @entity12 in the centre of the city , which has been put on the market with a guide price of £ 1million for the whole centre			1
history : the @entity5 was the club where the @entity2 made their name - here ( from left to right ) @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22 can be seen playing their final gig at the venue @entity25 : the club also played host to the band 's earlier look , featuring leather jackets			2
in those days the band had yet to recruit @entity32 , and had @entity33 on drums instead trendy : the @entity5 , as pictured here before demolition , was a central part of the @entity6 music scene although the business which runs the venue will not be affected , as its lease extends to 2028 , the owners of the property will change with the sale			2
it has been offered by owners @entity48 , who filed for administration in august , the @entity46 reported			0
the club was frequented by the @entity2 in the early 1960s , before they shot to international fame			1
in the beginning the venue would pay them just £ 3 , 15 shillings per gig			0
they played there mainly with drummer @entity33 , as @entity32 had yet to join the band			0
it was not a licensed venue , so sold soft drinks and food while acts were playing , and was popular with teenagers			0
the early gigs also played host to a very different band than the one which would come to dominate pop music			0
rebuilt : the @entity5 , pictured as it is now , with the doorway in the same spot , has been put up for sale as part of a £ 1million deal continuation : the club is still a thriving venue legacy : a famous feature of the cavern is a wall with names of all the bands who played there written on it			1
sir @entity21 is pictured here in front of in in 1999 back on stage : former @entity2 sir @entity21 took to the stage again , alongside @entity95 guitarist @entity94 , in 1999 in those days the boys wore leather jackets and blue jeans - which almost got @entity20 kicked out of the club for breaching the dress code			2
the would also swear , smoke and eat on stage , and sometimes stop mid-song - in stark contrast to the slick and clean image that later propelled them to stardom			0
@entity22 later said of the years playing the club : ' in those old @entity5 days , half the thing was just ad lib , what you ’d call comedy			0
we just used to mess about , jump into the audience , do anything			0
' trendy : the club was a mainstay of the @entity6 social circuit in the ' 60s dancing : the underground club was often full of revellers listening to the latest hits as well as being an early stomping ground where the band would hone their performance , the club was also where the band were discovered by manager @entity129 , who managed their ascent and helped develop their signature style			1
the club as it stood in the 60s was eventually demolished in 1973 to make way for a railway development , but was re-founded in the 1980s on almost the exact same site with many of the original bricks			1
the club which helped foster @entity2 ' career also played host to other classic acts in the 1960s and 1970s , including the @entity145 , the @entity146 , @entity147 and @entity148			1
but the underground club was forced to close in 1973 to make way for a rail development			2
the site was left dormant until it was bought in the early 1980s for redevelopment			0
@entity6 football player @entity153 , along a business partner , signed the new lease on the club and opened in in april 1984 - the same time the @entity158 shopping centre opened			1
the new club , built deeper underground than the original , occupies 75 per cent of the original site , and was rebuilt using 15,000 bricks saved from the demolition			1
the club closed due to financial pressures in 1989 , but was reopened in 1991 by @entity167 and @entity168 , who have run the club for the past 22 years and ensured live music plays most nights			2
today 's pop royalty have picked up the baton of performing there - acts including @entity175 , @entity176 and @entity177 have played there in recent years .			0

underground club saw 300 performances by @entity2 in the early 1960s
was demolished in the 1970s and rebuilt nearby from the original bricks
it is now on sale as part of a shopping centre offered for around £ 1million , though the club will continue to run as *normal*
