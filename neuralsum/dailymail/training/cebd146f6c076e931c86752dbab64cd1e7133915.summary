with a harpist greeting guests , catering by an award - winning chef , a free bar and a personalised fireworks display , it was a wedding designed to impress			1
and it had the desired effect on the bride ’s boss , who was among 100 guests at the no - expense - spared bash in a medieval banqueting hall			1
incredulous at how 29 - year - old part - time accounts clerk @entity16 could afford such a lavish ceremony , @entity15 took a closer look at the books – and discovered she had stolen nearly £ 170,000 from the firm			1
indulgent : @entity16 , pictured with husband @entity22 , planned her dream wedding at a @entity25 - built hall and laid on a free bar for guests along with two bands and a fireworks display almost ruined : @entity31 's former boss @entity15 ( pictured ) said that her ' unbridled greed ' had almost ruined his audio visual business the mother of one was arrested before she had a chance to leave for their honeymoon in @entity39 , and yesterday she was facing a possible jail sentence over the audacious fraud			1
afterwards mr @entity15 told how her ‘ unbridled greed ’ had almost ruined his video conferencing business			1
‘ i trusted her implicitly and this was how she repaid us , ’ he said			1
‘ the wedding was the most lavish thing i ’ve ever seen			2
’ as @entity48 , the bride - to - be had worked for four years for @entity50 in @entity51 , @entity52 , earning less than £ 15,000 a year			1
all the directors were invited to her wedding to @entity31 – who works for an alarm firm – in january , with other colleagues joining for the reception			2
the event at the mock - @entity60 at @entity61 , near @entity62 , cost up to £ 40,000			1

the wedding breakfast was provided by celebrity chef @entity73 ’s firm and was accompanied by a swing singer , followed by a free bar and music from a @entity78 - style band plus a @entity79 children were entertained by face - painting and balloon - modelling while all guests were given feather masks to get them in the spirit of the occasion			1
such was the attention to detail that the new mrs @entity16 and her bridesmaids all had black @entity90 boots matching their outfits to protect them from the cold when photographs were taken outside			1
all the bridesmaids were given jewel - encrusted @entity95 to take home with them			1
my big fraudulent wedding : @entity16 and her bridesmaids show off some bizarre matching uggs at the ceremony in @entity52 sealed with a kiss : the couple 's lavish wedding took place at @entity61 venue in @entity107 , near @entity62 the evening ended with a fireworks display featuring the couple ’s initials illuminated as the centrepiece			1
they left in a white limousine for a ‘ minimoon ’ in the @entity116 before their main honeymoon in @entity39			2
‘ it was really over the top from the moment we arrived to the time we left , ’ said a colleague who was there			2
‘ they had absolutely everything you could wish for , and it must have cost tens of thousands			2
we even joked with @entity16 that we were going to go back to the office and check the accounts			2
‘ she certainly was n’t well off , and the story we were given was that her mother had been made redundant and the money she received was paying for it			2
’ days after the wedding , while mrs @entity16 was still in the @entity116 , managing director mr @entity15 was alerted to a problem with an invoice			0
@entity138 in it : the bride 's dream wedding was funded by false invoices that she paid into her bank account a day to remember ... for all the wrong reasons : @entity16 and her fiance @entity22 at their lavish wedding bash , which treated guests to an extravagant party ordinarily he would have dismissed it as a genuine mistake but , having seen how spectacular her wedding had been , he decided to dig deeper , company sources said			1
there was enough evidence to suspend her on her return from the @entity116			0
a full investigation was launched and she was arrested shortly before the pair were due to jet out to @entity39			0
‘ if she had been in work when the problem surfaced , she would have been able to hide it like she had for so long , ’ mr @entity15 said			0
‘ but because i was already getting suspicious , it all started to come out			0
it was a very clever , incredibly devious operation			0
’ two people lost their jobs as a result of the firm ’s struggles following @entity31 ’s fiddling			0
she had been using real invoices to existing suppliers to create extra payments into her own bank account for more than two years			0
it took two months to uncover the full extent of the deception			0
no expense spared : canapes were served at the reception , along with @entity181 amid ornate flower displays mr @entity15 said the firm had even loaned lane £ 7,000 and increased her wages after she complained of struggling financially			0
‘ we are not a large company , ’ he added			0
‘ how it did n’t sink us i do n’t know			0
it is only through the sheer determination of the rest of the team that we are still here			0
’ the firm , which has 18 employees and specialises in audiovisual equipment for offices , is now recovering			0
