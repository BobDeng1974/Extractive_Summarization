it may be banned for ordinary people in @entity2 , but @entity3 has at least one member in the country			1
supreme leader ayatollah @entity6 appears to have become one of the website 's newest members			0
despite banning it due to its use by activists to rally government opponents in 2009 , a page purporting to be for @entity6 himself launched a few days ago with the name @entity17			1
@entity6 has joined @entity3 despite banning the rest of @entity2 from the site due to government opposition in 2009 the 73 - year - old 's page displays pictures of him alongside speeches and pronouncements he has made			1
while there are several other @entity3 pages already devoted to @entity6 , the new one - whose number of ' likes ' was today close to 10,000 - appeared to be officially authorised , rather than merely the work of admirers			0
the page has been publicised by a @entity34 account of the same name that @entity2 experts believe is run by @entity6 's office			1
both @entity39 - based social media sites are blocked in @entity2 by a wide - reaching government censor but they are still commonly used by millions of @entity2 who use special software to get around the ban			1
in 2009 , social media were a vital tool for those @entity2 who believed the re-election of president @entity48 was rigged			1
@entity3 was used to help organise street protests of a scale not seen since the @entity51			0
the protests - which the government said were fuelled by @entity2 's foreign enemies - were eventually stamped out by the security forces and their political figureheads remain under house arrest			1
the cover photo for the supreme leader shows @entity6 being driven through the streets with hundreds of supporters surrounding his vehicle another picture shows @entity6 alongside @entity64 in the first days of @entity2 's @entity51 movement @entity6 's @entity3 page has so far shared a picture of a young @entity6 alongside the founder of the @entity69 , ayatollah @entity68 , in the early 1960s			1
it shares a similar tone , style and content with accounts devoted to disseminating @entity6 's message on @entity34 and @entity76 and to the website www.khamenei.ir , a sophisticated official website published in 13 languages			0
experts said the social media accounts showed that @entity2 , despite restricting access to such sites inside the country , was keen to use them to spread its world view to a global audience			1
' social media gives the regime leadership another medium of communication , one that can share their message with a younger and far more international demographic , ' said @entity95 , a @entity96 analyst at @entity97 , a @entity39 - based research organisation			0
@entity2 has yet to comment on whether ayatollah @entity6 has joined @entity3 or not @entity2 is locked in a decade - long dispute with the @entity99 over its nuclear programme , which the @entity39 and its allies suspect is aimed at developing a bomb , something @entity2 has repeatedly denied			2
@entity2 , the @entity99 and regional states are also often opposed on issues such as the violence raging in @entity107 and the @entity110 - @entity109 conflict			2
@entity2 authorities have said they are trying to build a national intranet , something sceptics say is a way to further control @entity2 ' access to the global web			2
@entity117 tried to block @entity119 's email service this year but soon reopened access			0
@entity2 authorities had no immediate comment on the site , which apparently went online last week but only recently gained prominence among social media watchers			1
despite the possibility that it is a hoax , the page has generated at least 170 comments - laudatory and derogatory , and nearly all in @entity128 - that highlight the deep political divisions in @entity2 and possibly opposition fervor from expatriate @entity2			2
one post compared @entity6 to a celebrated ruler of ancient @entity2 , @entity133 , who significantly expanded the @entity135 2,500 years ago			1
another wrote : ' mr. @entity6 , how are you visiting this page ? with proxy ? ' it was a reference to @entity2 's blocking of @entity3 and many other @entity143 social media sites , and the efforts to bypass the restrictions using proxy server links from outside @entity2			2
the @entity147 said monday it will keep tabs on the page , but had no comment on whether it was genuine or not			0
spokeswoman @entity151 joked that @entity152 is curious how many ' likes ' the @entity149 receives			0
but much about the page - including an informal photo of @entity6 riding in a car - suggested it was not sanctioned by @entity2 's top leader			2
it is also highly unlikely that @entity6 would endorse a banned outlet such as @entity3			0
the @entity160 is not unknown territory for @entity2 leaders , however			0
@entity6 , president @entity48 and others have official websites			0
also , some senior @entity2 clerics issue religious opinions by email .			0
