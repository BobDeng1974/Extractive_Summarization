by @entity0 published : 02:50 est , 15 may 2012 updated : 08:19 est , 15 may 2012 it looks like a floating car seat - but @entity5 's robotic @entity4 unicycle lets ordinary people do what used to be the province of circus performers , and stay upright on just one wheel			1
you simply lean to ' drive ' , and to steer - and in a demonstration in @entity15 this week , volunteers piloted it with ease			2
when not in use , it can be folded up into a tiny carry case - although its top speed , 3.7mph , not far off walking speed , may mean it 's not enormously popular with commuters			1
# @entity5 unveiled the new device on tuesday , which allows the rider to control its speed , up to 3.7mph per hour , and direction by shifting one 's own weight so far , there is no release date for the robot unicycle , which has a top speed of 3.7mph the device was shown off by @entity5 this week - as yet , there are no plans for a release date			1
the device is meant to be nimble enough that it can be used indoors			1
as well as cars and motorcycles , @entity5 also has a long track record in robotics , with a humanoid robot , @entity45 , that is a regular at its stage shows			1
swaying your body from side to side is all you need to do to turn , rotate full circle and zip around on the @entity4			2
the @entity4 has one main wheel , while a tiny wheel at the back helps for circular moves			1
reporters got a test ride on the machine tuesday			2
it takes some getting used to but responds smoothly and quietly			2
lean forward to go straight , to the left to go left			2
if all fails to stop , just put your foot down			2
@entity4 will be on display at a @entity15 science museum			0
there are no plans yet for a commercial product			0
the single wheel on the @entity70 is made up of many tiny motor - controlled wheels , packed inside the bigger wheel , allowing the device to swerve in any direction			1
the @entity70 weighs just under 22 pounds , runs on a full charge for an hour , and has a lithium - ion battery			0
it is best suited to those over 5ft			0
@entity79 , executive director of national museum of emerging science and innovation ( @entity81 ) and former astronaut , rides @entity5 's new @entity84 personal mobility device at the museum in @entity15 swaying your body from side to side is all you need to do to turn , rotate full circle and zip around on the @entity4 , which looks a bit like a floating car seat former @entity93 mission specialist @entity79 demonstrates @entity5 's new robotics technology , @entity4 it may look a little precarious and uncomfortable to ride , but @entity5 believe their new ' personal mobility ' device could one day be zipping up and down our streets			0
the vehicle looks like a very modern unicycle and to ride it you simply lean your weight in the direction you want to go , whether that 's forward , backwards or even sideways			1
it maintains its own balance travelling up to @entity107			0
a slippery slope ? @entity111 film @entity109 predicted humans would become too obese to walk in the future after relying on technology the @entity70 can be easily carried ( left )			0
like the @entity115 ( pictured with former @entity117 prime minister @entity116 , right ) the @entity115 the @entity70 moves when you shift your weight @entity5 makes the @entity45 walking child - shaped robot and the @entity70 uses some of the same technology			1
last year , @entity5 also unveiled a gadget that can support a wearer 's bodyweight , made of mechanical frames attached to a pair of shoes			0
@entity117 rival @entity129 has shown machines that help people get around , including the @entity133 , similar to the @entity115 , a scooter - like device that people ride standing up			1
@entity117 is one of the most rapidly aging societies in the world , and concerns are growing about helping the elderly get around			0
' @entity5 engineers are always thinking about people 's dreams and wishes about mobility			0
we will continue to work hard to be a leader in that area , ' mr @entity147 said .			0

tiny unicycle has top speed of 3.7mph
can be folded up into carry case
like @entity115 , robot ' brains ' keep rider upright
designed to be nimble enough to be used indoors
