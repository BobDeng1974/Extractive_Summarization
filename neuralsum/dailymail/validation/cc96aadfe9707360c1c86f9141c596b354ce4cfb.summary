they were just ten and seven when their beautiful tv presenter mother , @entity2 , lost a long battle with breast cancer at just 41			1
a decade later , they have transformed from angelic - looking boys into strapping , handsome young men			1
@entity8 is currently enjoying a year out from his advertising degree to complete internships and @entity11 , his gentle younger brother , is in his final year studying his a-levels			1
the boys were just ten and seven when they lost their mum , @entity2 , to breast cancer as they were : doting @entity14 , pictured with her grandsons as young children , says she feels disappointment that her daughter is n't here to watch her sons ' achievements the days when she could cradle them in her arms have long passed but their achievements leave their grandmother , @entity14 , bursting with pride			1
however she admits her happiness hides traces of disappointment that their mother has missed sharing their milestones			0
the @entity39 panelist and tv presenter , 74 , said : ‘ the only time i do get frustrated is when i think about all the brilliant moments @entity2 ’s missing as the boys grow up			2
' when @entity8 first went to university , i felt really quite disturbed by that			2
@entity2 had an understanding of @entity49 literature that i do n’t have			2
she would have loved to sit down with @entity8 and now with @entity11 to discuss whatever it was that they were studying			1
‘ from the research i ’ve done , it seems that a child misses a parent most when he graduates , when he gets engaged , when he marries and particularly when he has his first child			0
you want to show your child to your parents			0
and @entity8 and @entity11 will never be able to do that with their mother			1
’ what bolsters @entity65 , who is married to hairdresser @entity66 , is the warm and loving relationship she has with her grandsons			2
they tease her mercilessly , which she plainly adores , calling her a variety of names from @entity74 , to @entity75 , @entity76 or @entity77 she said : ‘ what helps to sustain me now is that they ’ve turned out to be such fine young men			1
and i think it ’s lovely that they ’re still very huggy with me , very demonstrative which is n’t always the case with boys of their age and they rib me all the time			0
‘ they ’re part of my healing			0
i see @entity2 ’s spirit living on in them and that ’s a comfort to me			2
@entity8 has her wicked sense of humour and @entity11 looks so like her			1
they ’ve been in my life from the moment they entered the world , quite literally			0
@entity2 asked me to be there as each of them was born			2
so the bond between us has always been exceptionally tight and was made even more so because of her loss			0
’ miss @entity109 was a popular @entity110 presenter and was diagnosed with breast cancer in 1997			1
she was initially told she would be lucky to survive more than 18 months but went on to live for seven years before she died in her mother ’s arms in 2004			2
unbreakable bond : @entity14 keeps the memory of @entity2 , who passed away in 2004 , alive with regular fundraising events for the @entity2 soon after , @entity65 , backed by the rest of the family , set up the @entity2 which has now raised millions , given away in small grants to hundreds of deserving causes for all types of cancer			1
at the end of november ( 2014 ) , a glitzy dinner at the @entity125 was organised to celebrate @entity2 ’s life and to talk about the foundation			2
a succession of famous faces , both in person and on screen , paid their tributes			0
@entity134 , @entity135 , @entity136 , @entity137 , @entity138 , @entity139 , @entity140 – all shared recollections of the popular tv presenter			0
the @entity110 presenter lost her battle with breast cancer when her sons , @entity8 and @entity11 , were just 10 and seven @entity8 joked : ‘ and i learnt a few things about @entity148 - i did n’t know that @entity147 could have been my dad			1
apparently , he and @entity148 went out together for about a year which was something no one had ever told me			0
’ there were insights for @entity11 , too , about his quirky dress sense : ‘ i did n’t realise me and my mum shared the same shopping habits			1
she also tended to buy clothes that a normal person might not			0
' for example , i got it into my head recently to buy a completely white puffa jacket which is totally impractical as i discovered today when a girl gave me a big hug and got foundation all down it			0
glo tells me @entity148 was into grunge before it had been invented			0
she had a really wacky dress sense			0
and she was a hoarder like me			0
’ gloria on @entity2 's wedding day to the boys ' father @entity175			1
he 's since gone on to remarry , to television presenter @entity177 , and have two daughters their father @entity175 went on to marry breakfast presenter @entity177 , 49 , in 2006 and the boys have two half - sisters they adore : @entity184 , six and @entity185			1
@entity8 and @entity11 are committed to running the foundation in the future but for now @entity65 is more than happy to carry on , for keeping @entity2 ’s memory alive is a source of comfort : ‘ i have a little saying , ’ she said : ‘ people never die if they live on the lips of the living			1
