despite previous claims , contaminated groundwater found in areas of @entity2 and @entity3 was not caused by controversial fracking drills			1
instead , the tainted water supplies are being blamed on problems in pipes and seals in nearby natural gas wells			2
experts focused on eight hydraulically fractured wells in both states , and used chemical analysis to determine when in the process of gas extraction methane leaked into groundwater			1
researchers claim the drilling procedure called fracking did n't cause water in @entity3 and @entity2 to become contaminated			1
instead , they blamed the methane levels on leaky wells			2
fracking operations at a wellpad overlying the @entity26 in @entity2 pictured ' we found the evidence suggested that fracking was not to blame , that it was actually a well integrity issue , ' said @entity31 geochemist @entity30 , lead author of the study			2
he added those results are good news because this type of contamination problem is easier to fix and is more preventable than the damage caused by fracking			2
in fracking , highly pressurised chemicals and water are pumped deep underground to break shale and release natural gas for harvesting			0
experts focused on eight hydraulically fractured wells in @entity2 and @entity3			1
they reached their conclusions by chemically analysing methane and other chemicals in the groundwater			0
that let them link the contamination to particular wells , and then to discover what part of the drilling process was responsible			1
for example , they studied the precise proportions of methane , helium , neon and argon			1
those proportions pointed to leaky pipes and seals , because the results would have been different if the contamination had come from fracking			1
earlier this year , residents began accusing the fracking process for the contamination , claiming the fracturing allowed methane to travel up , outside the pipes , into water supplies			1
in at least two cases around a well in @entity3 , scientists saw methane levels in people 's home jump ten-fold during the year of study			2
' i do n't think homeowners care what step in the process the water contamination comes , ' @entity85 environmental sciences professor @entity84 said			0
' they just care that their lives have changed because drilling has moved next door			0
' since the fracking began in @entity2 in 2008 , the state has identified 243 cases of private water supply contamination ' impacted by oil and gas activities ' - out of more than 20,000 wells drilled in the region			1
@entity84 and colleagues have been studying water contamination around natural gas wells for years , but rather than choosing random samples for this particular study , his team aimed their research at areas with the most contamination complaints			2
and even in those areas , it was only in a minority of dozens of sites that they could they connect the contamination to the natural gas wells , he said			0
experts reached their conclusions by chemically analysing methane and other chemicals in the groundwater in @entity3 ( pictured ) and @entity2			1
they could then link the contamination to particular wells , and then to discover what part of the drilling process was responsible this graphic reveals how gas is extracted from the ground using fracking techniques in some cases , the contamination was natural and had no connection to gas wells , @entity84 said			1
@entity135 , a professor of geosciences at @entity137 who was n't part of the study , praised it , saying ' focusing on frack fluids at depth is not the real problem			0
' it is possible the high pressure of fracking or the bends in unconventional wells could lead to problems with the well 's piping , but there 's no evidence yet proving that , @entity84 added			0
another issue could be the hurry drillers are in during a boom , leading to poor quality wells , he said			0
@entity159 , president of the @entity160 of drillers , said his industry is working with state officials ' to modernize and dramatically strengthen shale development - related regulations			0
' @entity166 engineering professor @entity165 , who was n't part of the study , praised it , adding that he 's worried because ' it 's impossible to drill and cement a well that will never leak			0
' ' there 's still serious and signiicant harm from what 's coming before fracking and what 's coming after fracking , ' @entity165 said			0
the findings were published in the @entity179 journal .			0
