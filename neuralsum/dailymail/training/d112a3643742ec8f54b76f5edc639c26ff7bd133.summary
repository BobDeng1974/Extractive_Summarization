@entity0 have an injury concern over skipper @entity2 ahead of saturday 's return to @entity5 action against @entity6			1
the @entity8 captain will sit out tuesday 's friendly against @entity10 in @entity11 before the champions fly home from their winter break on wednesday			1
@entity2 sustained a gash to his head in the early minutes of saturday 's opening - game loss to @entity17			1
@entity0 captain @entity2 receives treatment after suffering a cut head against @entity17 he was always scheduled to miss the @entity21 clash in any case , with @entity23 opting to field his younger fringe players			1
seeking to reel in @entity26 's four - point lead at the top of the league , @entity23 wants the midfielder back for the away clash with @entity6			1
hedging his bets on the issue , the @entity31 said : ' @entity2 was feeling it a little bit in his head today and his body			1
but i do n't think it 's a big thing			1
' he was n't going to play tomorrow [ tuesday ] anyway , so he will just have a couple of days resting			1
' i do n't have it in my mind that he could be a doubt for saturday			1
' again , that 's why i 'm wary about him maybe having had a concussion after saturday 's game			1
' he did n't have that			2
however , he feels a little bit vulnerable today , so we 'll see what 's happening			2
i think he 'll be ready for saturday			2
' defender @entity52 admits the loss of @entity2 , even for one game , has a negative impact on the team			1
' @entity2 is our captain and a really important player for us , ' he said			1
' you know when he is playing , he brings something else that maybe we do n't have without him			2
' but when you are playing for @entity0 , everyone has the ability to step up and play an important role			1
' @entity52 , meanwhile , is close to ending his two - month injury lay - off ahead of a critical period for the @entity8 side			2
@entity2 , pictured trying to stop the bleeding , should be fit to face @entity6 this weekend returning from a hamstring ailment which led to groin problems , the @entity71 international is close to his comeback			1
with a @entity77 semi-final clash against @entity78 and the last - 32 @entity80 ties with @entity81 around the corner , timing is everything			2
the right - back last played in november after sustaining his injury on international duty and said : ' i do n't really have a timescale for when i will be ready but , hopefully , it will be soon			1
' it has been really frustrating because it is much better to know exactly whether you will be out for three weeks or whatever			2
' i picked up the injury with @entity92 but there was another problem and it has taken longer than i expected			2
' but i am back in full training now and i am getting closer			1
' january and february are two big months and there are some huge games that you want to be playing in			2
the league is exciting and we are in both cups as well as the @entity80			2
' it has been hard just sitting watching			2
you just want to be out on the pitch but i had four months out last season and again this year			0
' @entity107 , @entity108 and @entity109 can all play his position and @entity52 admitted : ' there is a lot of competition for places			0
there have been three right - backs here for a while , so i am used to it			0
it 's not a big problem but i know it is going to be tough			0
' he will play no part in today 's second — and final — @entity126 friendly against @entity21			0
the patchy , dry pitch of the @entity129 has done @entity0 's players few favours			1
taking no chances , @entity23 will field his fringe kids			1
@entity52 believes tuesday 's game against @entity10 will be a good opportunity to impress ' it 's a chance for some of the guys who maybe have n't been playing as much to show what they can do , ' said @entity52			1
' @entity21 are a good side , so it will be good experience for our young players			0
' the @entity71 has his eyes on bigger games ahead			0
as well as @entity78 and @entity81 , @entity0 face a @entity148 tie at @entity149 and must find a way to win their games in hand and leapfrog @entity26 at the top of the @entity5			1
' @entity26 have n't lost in a long time and they have been looking really good , ' added @entity52			0
' we have to stay focused on our games because we know if we keep winning , then we will win the title			0
' there have always been good teams in the league , so we have always been focused			0
' and the challenge means we have to stay that way because @entity26 have done brilliantly			0
' they are up there but we ca n't play @entity26 every week			0
we have to take care of our own games			0
i think we are making progress in the right direction			0
' @entity52 admits the experience of going head to head with @entity26 , after reaching three titles in a row with a minimum of resistance , is a new one			1
' it is exciting being involved in a title race , ' he said			0
' the last couple of seasons , we knew in february we were going to win the title			0
' it 's a bit different this time round but it does keep you focused			0
there is no way we can rest four or five players at times like we did towards the end of last season			0
' we are not going to win the league by 20 points this year			0
i think it is going to be quite tight			0
' hopefully , our strength will show in the end			0
we have experienced players but we still need to treat every game like a cup final			0
