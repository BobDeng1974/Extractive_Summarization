by @entity0 published : 07:05 est , 20 august 2013 @entity2 : 10:11 est , 20 august 2013 ' spurious science ' : @entity4 , 47 , seen outside court today , sold his fake bomb detectors to clients for use by soldiers and police and customs officers a businessman who sold ' useless ' bomb detectors to international clients for thousands of pounds has been jailed for seven years			1
@entity4 , 47 , of @entity15 in @entity16 , sold the fake devices to for up to £ 10,000 each , boasting that they could detect explosives , narcotics , ivory , tobacco and even money			1
but a judge at the @entity25 today described the equipment as ' useless ' and ' dross '			1
tests revealed the devices - which @entity30 assembled at his home for less than £ 5 each - were no better at detection than random chance			1
the court heard the businessman was aware of the ' spurious science ' behind his product , but continued to market and sell the devices at home and abroad through his firm @entity41 for ' enormous ' profits			1
he denied two counts of fraud but was convicted by a jury at the @entity25 last month			2
sentencing the father - of - three today , judge @entity46 said @entity30 had maintained the ' little plastic box ' was a piece of working equipment , and that he continued to ' peddle ' it to scores of international clients - including for use by armed forces - despite evidence proving it was ' useless '			2
he added : ' you were determined to bolster the illusion that the devices worked and you knew there was a spurious science to produce that end			2
' they had a random detection rate			0
' the jury found you knew this but you carried on			0
' the court was told @entity30 ’s company , @entity41 in @entity91 , had a turnover of almost £ 3 million , with up to 5,000 devices made			1
bulk orders meant the @entity96 was sold for between £ 2,500 and £ 10,000 , although they retailed at up to £ 15,000 if bought individually , the court was told			2
fake : one of the devices @entity30 sold through his @entity91 firm @entity41 , which had a turnover of nearly £ 3million , the court heard around 1,200 devices were sold to @entity102 , while orders were also shipped to parts of @entity105 and the @entity106			1
the devices are still being used in @entity109 , the court heard			1
@entity110 , prosecuting , previously said the devices were relatively cheap to make			0
corruption probe : @entity30 , seen outside an earlier hearing , is a father - of - three from @entity15 in @entity16 he told the trial : ' in fact , the device , you may think , was nothing more than a box with a handle and antennae attached to it and pieces of plastic inside it			1
' @entity4 knew these devices did not work but he made and supplied them so that they could be sold			1
' the prosecutor said @entity4 admitted in interview to having no background in science , research , training or security , the court heard			1
members of the jury were told @entity30 claimed the devices worked with a range of 766 yards ( 700m ) at ground level and as far as 2.5 miles ( 4km ) in the air - although a @entity142 defence expert said it had ' no credibility as an explosive detector '			0
@entity4 was arrested in june 2010 following an investigation by @entity147 ’s overseas corruption unit			2
detective inspector @entity148 said : ' @entity4 made a fortune selling devices that were supposed to be able to detect explosives and other harmful substances but in reality were nothing more than plastic handles with aerials as antennae			1
' in doing so he was putting people ’s lives and livelihoods at serious risk , but his sole consideration was how much money he could make			0
' bringing @entity30 to justice is the result of a long , complex and far reaching international investigation and his seven - year prison sentence should act as a warning to others who seek to act corruptly overseas with the belief that they will go undetected			0
' @entity30 ’s sentence came after fellow conman @entity173 was jailed for 10 years earlier this year for three counts of fraud from selling fake bomb detectors			0
@entity177 , 57 , of @entity178 in @entity179 , was said to have made £ 50 million from his scam			0
representing @entity30 , @entity181 told the court that his client ’s offending - between 2007 and 2012 - was not on the same level as @entity177 ’s			0
he said : ' there is no suggestion that these devices were to be sold to and deployed as frontline devices to counter terrorist threat			2
trial : @entity30 assembled the ' little plastic boxes ' at his home at a cost of £ 5 , before ' peddling ' them to clients around the globe ' @entity199 ' : the boxes ' detection rate was no better than random chance , the @entity25 heard ' the countries to which tenders were made were using these devices for a range of different detections			1
' he added : ' this is a device which was sold honestly to start with			0
' but the judge said he did not accept that suggestion , also questioning the validity of a psychiatric report which said @entity4 was believed to have ' a depressive illness '			2
global firm : his multi-million pound firm shipped devices to @entity102 , parts of @entity105 and the @entity106 @entity30 , wearing a grey polo shirt , black trousers and canvas - style shoes , closed his eyes as his sentence was read out			1
the judge said : ' you have damaged the reputation of @entity229 trade abroad			0
' you gave spurious credibility to this product			0
' you ’re a fraudulent person			0
' a confiscation hearing is due to be held next year .			0
