controversial : 43 @entity1 workers have been jailed in @entity2 under president @entity3 , pictured more than a dozen @entity5 aid workers have been sentenced to prison in @entity2 after a court convicted them of stirring up unrest in the country			1
at least 16 @entity5 were among the 43 @entity1 workers who were today found guilty of illegally using foreign funds and given jail sentences of up to five years			1
most of the @entity5 left @entity2 last year , and are extremely unlikely to serve any prison time			1
the convicted aid workers include @entity15 , son of the @entity5 transportation secretary @entity16 , who was sentenced in absentia to five years in prison			1
the court in @entity20 also issued judgements against the @entity5 non-profit groups where the defendants worked , including the @entity24 , the @entity25 and @entity26			0
the organisations have had their @entity2 offices closed and their assets in the country seized			2
27 of the 43 defendants received five - year jail terms , with the others being given sentences of one or two years			0
chaos : the case dates back to the downfall of @entity38 during @entity2 revolution in 2011 the controversial case , which has angered @entity5 officials and threatened @entity5 aid to @entity2 , began early last year			1
it had its origins in the period of military rule which followed the downfall of long - serving dictator @entity38			0
@entity2 and the @entity5 have been close allies for more than three decades , with the @entity2 military receiving more than $ 1billion in aid annually			1
the aid is linked to a 1979 peace treaty with @entity51 , @entity54 's closest @entity53 ally			0
besides $ 1.3billion in @entity5 military aid , @entity2 also receives about $ 250million in economic aid every year			2
allies : but the case , coming 10 days after this meeting between mr @entity3 and @entity60 , threatens to undermine relations between @entity2 and the @entity5 relations between the two countries have long been affected by @entity2 's treatment of non-profit groups , which insist they are purely charitable and do not have political aims			1
last week , @entity67 and 40 @entity2 rights groups claimed a law regulating non-governmental organisations would restrict the funding and operation of independent groups			0
the contentious bill , proposed by @entity76 president @entity3 , would allow the state to control nonprofits ' activities as well as their domestic and international funding , according to @entity67			0
step backwards ? the move has been compared to the rule of long - serving dictator @entity38 in a joint statement , the 40 rights groups accused mr @entity3 's @entity86 and its political arm of seeking to curb the freedom of @entity1 through legal restrictions			0
they said the proposed law could give @entity2 's security apparatus the power to suppress rights group , drawing parallels to @entity38 's three decades of repression			2
they also expressed fears foreign non-profits would be treated with hostility and that vaguely worded legislation would hinder their operations .			0
