by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor @entity3 ’s railways could be taken back into public ownership if @entity5 wins the next election			2
@entity7 revealed he is examining ‘ innovative solutions ’ which could see the government replace the likes of @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13 in running trains across the country			1
the idea , backed by two - thirds of voters , would create a major dividing line with the @entity20 who have rushed to privatise the @entity23 line			1
labour leader @entity7 , pictured on a train with shadow chancellor @entity25 , said any plan to renationalise the railways had to be affordable the @entity23 line has been run by the state - owned directly operated railways since the @entity5 government took it over in 2009 when @entity30 walked away from the franchise			1
since then it has returned more than £ 600million to the @entity33 and has seen passenger satisfaction soar			0
however , the coalition plans to return the line to a private firm by february 2015			0
but mr @entity7 accused the government of being motivated by ‘ dogma ’ , against public ownership of major industries			0
he suggested that a future @entity5 government could take other lines back into state control when franchises expired			0
‘ we are interested in innovative solutions when it comes to the railways			1
it 's got to be affordable			0
that is absolutely definite , ’ he told @entity46			0
‘ the experience of @entity23 , which has been in public hands , has been a good experience			1
‘ the government is dogmatically wanting to privatise @entity23			2
i do n't think you should approach this issue with dogma on either side			0
so we are interested in innovative solutions			1
’ the @entity60 service was reintroduced by the government - owned @entity61 on the @entity23 line the idea was this week backed by @entity66 general secretary @entity65 , who said the public wanted to see the railways back in state control			1
a @entity71 poll last year showed 66 per cent of people wanted to see the railway companies run in the public sector			0
it included 52 per cent of @entity20 voters and 79 per cent of @entity5 supporters			2
last year ministers spent £ 1million preparing to take charge of the @entity81 main line from @entity82 before resorting to pleading with sir @entity84 ’s virgin trains to continue running his trains			0
five civil servants drew up a plan for the lucrative line from @entity89 to @entity90 to be renationalised after the collapse of the franchise competition which had been won by @entity11 ’s rival @entity12			1
but as the clock ticked down to the december 9 deadline when @entity11 was due to be kicked off the @entity89 to @entity90 line , ministers were forced to ask sir @entity84 to stay on while they find a more permanent solution .			2

labour looking at ' innovative solutions ' to running the railways
could see *taxpayer* take franchises over from @entity11 and @entity12
@entity61 runs @entity23 but will be privatised by @entity20
