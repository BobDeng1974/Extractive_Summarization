there is life after the @entity2 after all			0
so insular have we become amid the fanfare that surrounds @entity6 football that it is easy to forget this			2
here at the @entity9 last night , we expected an @entity11 sideshow			2
back in @entity6 for the first time since leaving @entity13 , the best left back of his generation looked unfamiliar in @entity17 colours			1
but it was not the 33 - year - old defender who caught the eye in an ominously impressive @entity17 display			1
indeed , his was not even the most notable performance by a former @entity25 player			1
@entity11 made his first playing return to @entity6 soil since leaving @entity13 over the summer to join @entity17 @entity28 was impressive throughout @entity17 's trip to @entity30 in his attacking role that honour went to @entity28 , who looks to have become an entirely different footballer since he left the care of @entity35 in the summer of 2013			1
at the age of 27 , the @entity37 striker should be at his peak			0
what is interesting , though , is that during his difficult two seasons at @entity25 he looked like a player who would probably never have one			1
his contribution to @entity25 ’s @entity2 efforts was just nine goals			2
throughout his stay , he looked ill - equipped for the @entity6 game			2
weak , erratic and unreliable , @entity28 came to represent what appeared to be wrong with @entity35 ’s transfer strategy for strikers			2
here on tuesday night , however , he showed himself to be rather better as @entity17 provided @entity30 with one of the sternest examinations they have had here in the @entity54 — a bold statement given the tough nights @entity57 and @entity58 have given the @entity2 champions in recent years			0
@entity28 runs past @entity30 defender @entity60 during the @entity54 tie the former @entity25 player has looked a different prospect since moving to @entity64 in 2013 to join @entity17 @entity11 tweeted his pleasure at the @entity17 performance and result but admitted it was strange to be back @entity11 certainly contributed			1
always a defender who could have made a career as a left - sided midfield player , he remains technically proficient and bright			2
towards the end of the first half he was a toe - end away from what would have been a memorable goal as he arrived a fraction too late to meet a low cross			0
@entity28 was more prominent and that was largely because @entity17 saw so much of the ball for the first hour			1
despite @entity30 beginning the evening with a goal , @entity17 terrified them at times and @entity28 ’s searing pace was at the heart of the threat			1
@entity85 and his team should not have been surprised			0
it is only two weeks since @entity17 scored five in @entity88 , with @entity28 contributing two of them			1
‘ wow , ’ was @entity30 goalkeeper @entity91 ’s response when told of that scoreline following defeat in @entity94 on the same night			0
now @entity11 ’s great friend has experienced first - hand what the @entity98 team are capable of when they have possession			2
the @entity37 striker scored nine @entity2 goals during his three years at @entity25 but @entity28 was better known for a string of unfortunate misses and rarely played up front for @entity25 @entity91 could no nothing when former @entity30 player @entity108 struck the underside of his bar early on and was similarly helpless when a rapier @entity17 thrust provided @entity111 with the equaliser not long after			1
@entity28 brought a super save from the @entity30 keeper after turning on the burners to flash past @entity116 and @entity60 just before half - time and it was the pace of the @entity118 — both with the ball and in the mind — that was the cause of the home team ’s troubles throughout			2
@entity30 can be devastating when they have the ball			0
in the @entity2 , they break as quickly as any team			0
there are times , though , when @entity85 ’s midfield can look ponderous and flat - footed if they do n’t have control of the game — and so it was on tuesday night			0
the striker celebrates with @entity111 after the vetera @entity118 had scored @entity17 's equaliser @entity11 stops @entity133 with help from @entity28			1
both former @entity25 players impressed on tuesday night @entity136 puts @entity30 ahead from the penalty spot in the fourth minute at the @entity9 with @entity138 having one of ‘ those ’ nights — when he looks more omnibus than blunderbuss — @entity30 struggled to hold @entity17 at bay			1
at times in the first hour it was reminiscent of @entity13 ’s domination of @entity30 here last february and on @entity150 nights at home it has to be better than this			0
this is only the group stage , after all			0
as the game wore on , @entity30 did find a little more of their true selves			0
@entity28 ’s influence waned and @entity11 was asked to spend substantially more time in his own half			1
@entity30 were the better team for the last 20 minutes			0
there was enough here , though , to concern @entity85			0
@entity11 , @entity160 await in @entity161 for the final group game in december and , on this evidence , @entity30 would not wish to go there needing too much			0
@entity136 celebrates giving @entity30 the perfect start after their defeat to @entity57 on the opening match - day @entity30 manager @entity85 embraces @entity17 boss @entity167 before kick off on tuesday @entity111 's deft chip beats @entity91 , putting @entity17 level after 23 minutes at the @entity9 @entity111 celebrates becoming the oldest player to score in the @entity54 at the age of 38 the @entity17 fans were in good voice throughout the match as their team put on a good display in @entity178			1

@entity17 put in good display during 1 - 1 draw in @entity178
former @entity25 forward @entity28 shows huge *improvement* on the player who left @entity6 just over a year *ago*
@entity11 also impressive on return to @entity6 after leaving @entity13
