a breakthrough in sustainable energy and car design has enabled a team of engineers to build the world 's first solar powered family car			1
the @entity8 team have created the world 's first ' energy positive ' car , which means it produces more energy than it uses			1
it also has enough room to seat a family of four			0
a breakthrough in sustainable energy and car design has enabled a team of engineers to build the world 's first solar powered family car using large solar panels that are placed on the roof of the car , ' @entity19 ' can travel 250 miles without sunshine and on a sunny day , when fully charged , it can drive up to 420 miles			1
this is nearly twice as far as a standard electric car can travel before it needs to be charged up			2
made with the latest in lightweight materials , such as high grade aluminium and carbon fibre , the car weighs a mere 380kg , 1120kg lighter than the average electrical car			1
@entity35 , @entity36 , at @entity37 , said : ‘ because the car is standing still 90 per cent of the time in front of your house or your office , we found out that in 10 out of the 12 months of the year , the car provided more energy than it uses			0

it can also seat a family of four using large solar panels that are placed on the roof of the car , ' @entity19 ' can travel 250 miles without sunshine and on a sunny day , when fully charged , it can drive up to 420 miles ‘ the car also produces twice the amount of energy needed to drive normal distances and soon our car will be granted a licence plate by the @entity8 authorities			2
‘ we strongly believe that the car of the future is much lighter , aerodynamic and more efficient			0
‘ solar panels are the solution for a sustainable future , and they can increase the range of your car			0
made with the latest in lightweight materials , such as high grade aluminium and carbon fibre , the car weighs a mere 380kg , 1120kg lighter than the average electrical car the car produces twice the amount of energy needed to drive normal distances and will soon be granted a licence plate in @entity8 ‘ the car is still expensive because it is a prototype and it is hand - made , but when the production is scaled up , the car could be just as affordable as a normal family car			1
‘ the solar cells on the roof of the car cost only £ 2,600			0
‘ our future designs will focus on making the car even more comfortable , practical and energy efficient , so in the end people have the feeling that they could buy a similar car at a dealership			0

the car - called @entity19 - is also world 's first ' energy positive ' car
it can seat four and travel twice as far as an electric car before *recharging*
it weighs a mere 380kg , 1120kg lighter than the average electrical car
