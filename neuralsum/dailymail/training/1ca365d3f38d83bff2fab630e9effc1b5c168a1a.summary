i am very happy to build on the foundations we have built over the last two years and now we move onto the next phase which i believe will be as exciting , challenging and rewarding			0

it leaves me hugely honoured			0
i 'm absolutely delighted to be able to continue what has been a really exciting time for the club			0
we 'll look to move forward again next season and over the coming seasons			2
salute : @entity0 celebrates at the final whistle following @entity3 's 3 - 2 win over @entity110 at @entity111 , a match in which @entity113 scored a last minute winner you said that you wanted to wait until the campaign was over before singing - how important was the timing of this announcement for you ? it was very important for me			1
we were talking through the season , but my focus was really on the team and the supporters			2
i wanted to just make sure we could focus entirely on what we were doing and on the job in hand			0
any contract talk we would speak on afterwards			2
it was important that we tried to finish the season in the highest position we possibly could and that would allow us then to look at speaking about the contract after that			1
it was always going to be straightforward because i love being at @entity3			1
there 's still a lot of development in the club for me and it was always going to be straight forward once the season was @entity142 terms of your vision for @entity3 , how far do you think the club has progressed since you arrived here in june 2012 ? i 've been very pleased with the culture and the environment that we 've created over the last two seasons			1
that has been key in helping us make the strides that we have			0
we 've got a bunch of players now that are very hungry , who are very committed to helping @entity3			1
i take great pride and i trust every single one of the players			2
they are truly professional in their approach			0
they dedicate their lives to making @entity3 the very best it can be			1
so i think the environment that we have created and the culture that we have for learning , for both senior and young players , i 've been delighted with			0
but we 'll now move into the next phase			0
we 're into the @entity173			0
our dream and goal is to win the @entity27			1
that 's what we want to do			0
we 've shown this season that we can compete for that			2
with some new additions in the summer , we believe that we can fight again			0
the objective for me was to try to get @entity3 established again as one of the leading clubs in @entity185 and domestic football and we 're on course for that			1
teamwork : @entity0 with captain @entity113 ( middle ) and @entity61 ( left ) after the win at @entity191 having tasted the @entity5 atmosphere at its finest towards the end of this season , how much are you looking forward to the famous @entity173 nights back at @entity5 ? it 's a real exciting time			1
i 've seen the games before and i 've been fortunate enough to have been at @entity5 on a @entity173 occasion and they are truly special occasions			1
you see the support the players get			0
we had it in the @entity206 , when i sensed a little bit of that atmosphere			0
of course , it 's a different competition , but when we needed to get the win against @entity211 , the supporters that night were incredible			0
throughout my time here , in the big games , the supporters really show how passionate they are and they show why they are the great set of supporters that they are			2
we 'll really look forward to it			0
we know that , in the @entity173 , if we can perform well away from home , that in the home games , we 're going to be hard to beat because of the supporters and the quality of the @entity224 today expressed their delight at the fact that you have signed a new contract - can you describe how important their support has been since you arrived at @entity3 ? that has been key for me because , as a young manager , coming into such a prestigious club , i was going to need that time to implement the ideas that i wanted to			1
they had shown an inherent belief in my work since the very first day that we spoke			0
so our relationship is very strong			0
i 'm a great admirer of theirs and their honesty and how they have given me the opportunity to be here			2
but , as i said , there 's a real trust and a real strong relationship between both of us			0
i 'm delighted for them because they put a young man in charge of a great club and they believed in me			2
one of the big reasons i came to @entity3 was because of them and hopefully they feel vindicated because of the work we have carried out over the last two years			1
i 'm delighted now to be able to carry on that relationship with them			0
delight : a handshake for defender @entity260 after the 3 - 0 win at @entity262 what is your plan of action for the summer ahead of the next campaign - will we see new signings ? that 's the idea			2
obviously it 's the off - season and we have the @entity272 and other various things going on			1
people need to refresh and have a break because we have a long season ahead next season			1
but in the meantime , we 're still working on signings , the staff behind the scenes , myself , the recruitment team , @entity284 - we 're all working hard still in terms of looking to get players in			2
of course , at the club , where we are now , the signings are complex ; they are not all simple signings			0
but we need to strengthen up the squad and that 's something that we 're working hard to do over the next number of @entity294 relationship with the @entity3 supporters seems to have developed into something special , what is your message to them after today 's news ? first of all , i want to say a big thank you because they have been patient with me as well as the team			2
their support for me is vital			0
they are the greatest supporters in world football			2
@entity3 supporters know their football and they know they are part of a great institution			1
i 'm just very honoured and privileged every time they sing my name or show me that support out on the street			2
it 's very , very important for me			0
it gives me great encouragement every day of my life that all the supporters i meet are very complimentary of the work that is going on at the moment			0
hopefully now , this contract extension will allow us to develop that relationship even more , because it 's a relationship that i want to continue .			0
