by @entity0 published : 05:38 est , 17 may 2012 updated : 07:35 est , 28 june 2012 the showpiece genocide and war crimes trial of the ' @entity3 of @entity5 ' @entity4 was dramatically halted in the @entity6 today after an extraordinary and embarrassing blunder by prosecutors			1
presiding judge @entity9 suspended the hearing of the @entity11 indefinitely after prosecutors failed to disclose thousands of documents to the defence team			0
incredibly , prosecutors had over 16 years while the 70 year - old , the one - time military commander accused of orchestrating the @entity18 massacre of 8,000 men and boys , was on the run to prepare for the case			1
scroll down to watch evidence shown to the court defiant : @entity4 pictured left yesterday and right , in 1993 when he was commanding the @entity5 war discovered : @entity27 army commander @entity4 , who was arrested in @entity28 after years in hiding			1
picture from may 26 , 2011 but yesterday they acknowledged their mistakes which judge @entity9 described as ' significant disclosure errors			0
' the announcement could lead to a six - month delay and is seen as a major setback for the court in one of its highest profile cases , its final trial to focus on atrocities committed during the 1992 - 95 @entity5 war , which left over 100,000 dead			1
the proceedings are being broadcast live in @entity5 where @entity27 , who consider @entity4 a hero , mocked the court greeting the decision with a mixture of laughter and applause			1
but for the families of @entity53 's victims and other @entity5 atrocities it was a ' heartbreaking ' blow and yet another delay in their quest to see the man they blame of the deaths of tens of thousands brought to justice			1
anger : @entity5 demonstrate outside the @entity63 ( @entity63 ) during the trial of @entity65 general @entity4 leader : @entity4 ( centre ) pictured arriving at the airport of @entity69 in order to negotiate the withdrawal of his troops from @entity73 in 1993 @entity4 is said to have suffered two strokes and heart problems while on the run and the fear of many @entity78 is that they will be robbed of justice again			1
and like @entity82 president @entity81 he will die in custody before a judgement is reached			0
judge @entity9 said the court will analyse the ' scope and full impact ' of the error and aim to establish a new starting date ' as soon as possible			1
' the presentation of evidence was supposed to begin later this month and @entity4 's attorney has asked for a six - month delay			1
@entity4 faces 11 charges - ironically , several were dropped in a bid to speed - up the trial - and life imprisonment if convicted			1
he is accused of commanding @entity27 troops who waged a campaign of murder and persecution to drive @entity102 and @entity103 out of territory they considered part of @entity28 and oversaw the 44 - month siege of @entity69 , the @entity5 capital , that killed 10,000			1
@entity108 spokeswoman @entity107 said much of the material not given to the defence focused on witnesses who prosecutors had intended to call to testify			0
@entity5 @entity65 wartime leader @entity113 ( right ) has been acquitted of one of the two genocide charges he facess			0
he is pictured with his general @entity4 ( left ) in 1995 on @entity116 details of the evidence against @entity4 had been outlined in chilling and graphic detail to the court before the sudden suspension of proceedings			1
prosecuting counsel @entity123 said the crimes at @entity53 had never been in dispute so the prosecution 's focus would be on individual criminal responsibility			1
he claimed the @entity129 was not an ' army out of control ' and that @entity4 had been on the ground and in command			2
' we have radio intercepts of @entity129 [ @entity27 ] soldiers and officers discussing murders , ' mr @entity123 said			0
wanted men : these posters were released by the @entity141 in 2000 he added : ' we have video of two of the actual executions themselves			2
so let me be perfectly clear , the crime will not be the main focus of this prosecution			0
this case will be primarily about one issue			0
the individual criminal responsibility of @entity4			2
' the court watched video of local people panicking in a @entity157 compound outside @entity53 on 11 july 1995 as @entity27 forces approached , followed by scenes of @entity4 triumphantly entering the town			1
' we give this town to the @entity163 as a gift , ' he says to the camera			2
another video playing in court showed @entity4 addressing a bus full of @entity102 , telling them : ' good afternoon			1
you heard stories about me for a very long time			0
now you are looking at me			0
there are able - bodied people among you			0
you are all safe and you are all going to be transported to @entity177			0
we wish you a safe journey			0
you who are of a military age , do n't go to the front again ! no more forgiveness			0
now i am giving you your life as a gift			2
' another prosecutor @entity189 said that by the time gen @entity4 and his troops had ' murdered thousands in @entity53 ' , they were ' well - rehearsed in the craft of murder '			1
mr @entity123 outlined how , after overrunning @entity53 , @entity4 's forces summoned buses and trucks from across @entity5 to transport women and girls out of the enclave			1
the men and boys were then driven to remote locations and gunned down by firing squads , their bodies ploughed into mass graves			2
salute : @entity4 ( right ) pays tribute to his troops in the east @entity5 town of @entity210 in 1995 trial : dubbed the ' @entity212 ' , @entity4 is charged with masterminding atrocities that left 100,000 dead evidence : @entity78 forensic experts unearth bodies of victims of the 1995 @entity53 massacre in 2004 he said the remains - sometimes no more than a couple of bones - of 5,977 victims have been exhumed so far			1
he showed photographs of an exposed mass grave to underscore the point that the victims were not war casualties			0
one photo showed a skull , its teeth exposed and its eyes covered by a blindfold			0
another showed a pair of hands bound with a strip of cloth behind a body 's back			0
one woman , @entity241 , wept in the court 's lobby during a break in the proceedings			0
' i buried both of my sons and my husband			0
now i live alone with memories of my children , ' she said			0
' i would never wish even @entity4 to go through what i go through			2
' allies : leader of the @entity27 @entity113 ( left ) , @entity4 ( centre ) and @entity255 , president of the @entity256 ( right ) it took 17 years to bring @entity4 to trial in what observers say is a testament to the loyalty he inspired among @entity163 and the power of their nationalist cause			2
but as @entity28 's goal of integration with @entity268 overtook its defiance , he lost his comfortable protection			0
and by the end he was reduced to sheltering , penniless and sick , in a cousin 's farmhouse			0
the son of a @entity276 partisan fighter killed in 1945 , @entity4 was an officer in the old communist @entity278 ( @entity279 ) when @entity281 's disintegration began in 1991			2
when @entity163 rose up in 1992 against @entity5 's @entity102 - led secession , he was picked to command the army that swiftly overran 70 per cent of the country			1
it was a model of ruthlessness , daring and brutality in the @entity65 warrior tradition once prized in the life - or - death struggle against @entity290			2
but @entity292 officers who dealt soldier - to - soldier with @entity4 when @entity157 evenhandedness was official policy later came to regret shaking his hand			1
@entity297 graved : @entity299 investigators clear away soil and debris from dozens of @entity53 victims memories : a @entity78 woman weeps next to @entity53 graves ( left ) as a 1992 picture shows a @entity5 special forces soldier returning fire in @entity69 as he and civilians come under fire from snipers			1
