perhaps all @entity1 ’s batsmen should have spent their first practice day studying policing skills instead of preparing for the final test			1
it certainly did not appear to do their captain any harm as @entity8 stood firm against @entity10			0
@entity8 can appear a detached , uninterested figure when things are going badly for his side , as in the last two tests , but there was no doubting his commitment to the @entity18 cause while all around him collapsed at the @entity19			0
if it were not for @entity8 , who spent wednesday at a police training centre in @entity21 rather than training at the @entity19 , @entity1 would already be all but beaten , with @entity10 ’s recovery from a 1 - 0 deficit to a 3 - 1 series triumph near complete			1
this was the bowling performance @entity10 badly wanted after naming an unchanged side , with @entity47 and @entity25 vindicating the faith placed in them by playing a full role in support of @entity52 and @entity33			1
between them @entity10 ’s attack were far too hot for a deflated @entity1 to handle on a greener than usual @entity19 pitch and with conditions very much in the bowlers ' favour after @entity40 had won an important toss			2
even though @entity10 took nine wickets in that last session at @entity62 to hurry @entity1 to defeat they were disappointed @entity47 and @entity25 could not fully grab the chance presented to them by injury to @entity33 and illness to @entity52			1
they could have easily decided the time was right for the re-introduction of @entity71 or the return of @entity73 but instead were conscious of the need to provide proper opportunities for emerging players to establish themselves			0
@entity47 in particular seemed to benefit from a longer run than his first in test cricket , which ended abruptly after two tests against @entity80 , as he looked much more like the man who made such an impression in one day cricket			0
it was here in south @entity86 this time last year that @entity25 made an unexpected debut in the last test against @entity90 and the jury has been well and truly out on him during three tests where he had taken just two wickets			0
this , however , was much more like it , the frailties of an @entity18 batting line - up who seem to think their job was done after they took the lead at @entity105 ’s helping @entity47 and @entity25 to six wickets between them as @entity10 made hay			1
with @entity52 taking two of the eight wickets he needed to overtake sir @entity111 and become @entity10 ’s leading wicket - taker and @entity33 proving his fitness with two victims of his own @entity40 was very much in control			1
bowled over : @entity33 appeals for an @entity10 wicket at the @entity19 @entity118 man : @entity52 bowls to @entity119 in the final test of the series last stand : @entity1 batsman @entity8 scored 82 but could not prevent the collapse @entity124 shakes : @entity125 congratulates @entity8 on reaching his half century @entity1 assisted the @entity10 captain , too			1
it is difficult to over-estimate the transformation in this series since @entity10 collapsed in a heap on the last day of the second test and @entity40 ’s captaincy appeared to be hanging by a thread			2
@entity8 ’s side had a wonderful chance to make history in winning a five - test series in @entity10 but they have fallen apart ever since while losing focus over their obsession with the spat between @entity52 and @entity141			1
@entity10 were excellent on friday but @entity1 were woeful , no - one other than @entity8 , and his partner in a last - wicket partnership of 58 in @entity144 , showing any sort of application or stomach for the fight			2
the tone was set when @entity52 removed @entity150 , trying to leave a brute of a delivery , with the fourth ball of the match and it was reinforced when @entity33 removed another brick in the wall that was @entity157			0
enter @entity47 who continued where he left off at @entity62 , where he ended the @entity28 with two wickets in successive balls , with two wicket maidens here to remove both @entity163 and @entity164			2
at which time , across the two tests , @entity47 had taken four wickets without conceding a run in 14 balls			0
and so it continued until @entity144 , badly missed by @entity1 in the last two tests , joined his captain and held @entity10 up in yet another productive last - wicket stand , even though @entity1 should never have reached three figures			2
watch the birdie : @entity25 bowls while pigeons feed on the square early shower : @entity52 is congratulated after taking the wicket of @entity150 working up an appetite : @entity10 captain @entity40 and @entity33 walk of for tea flying high : @entity40 led @entity10 to 62 - 0 with @entity41 before play stopped for the day there was a suspicion @entity8 had edged one early in his innings that @entity10 failed to appeal for while @entity185 spoilt an otherwise perfect day for the new - look slip cordon by spilling @entity144 off @entity187 when @entity1 were on just 95			1
yet it was only a mild irritation for an @entity10 side who maintained the initiative they first claimed in @entity192 and maintained in @entity193 under a captain in @entity40 who has come through such a searching examination			0
@entity40 ’s luck changed when he was dropped on 15 by @entity141 before going on to 95 in @entity192 and he received another slice here on nine when @entity10 replied as @entity199 turned down an lbw appeal from @entity201 that @entity202 suggested was plumb			0
the @entity10 captain lived to fight another day and if his side bat all day on saturday then they really will be almost home and hosed .			0

@entity10 bowled @entity1 out for 148 in the @entity28 at the @entity19
@entity40 *'s* side lead 2 - 1 going into the final test of the series
@entity25 and @entity47 took three wickets apiece
@entity33 played despite breaking his nose in the previous test
@entity1 captain @entity8 reached 82 before being last wicket taken
bad weather *delayed* play for half an hour at the start of the day
@entity40 and @entity41 scored 62 - 0 before play stopped for the day
