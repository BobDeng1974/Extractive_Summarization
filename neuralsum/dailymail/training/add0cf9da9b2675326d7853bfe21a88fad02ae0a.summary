by @entity0 she was one of the most photographed women in @entity4 history , so it 's hard to believe there are still powerful images of @entity8 which have never seen the light of day			0
now some of the most arresting ' forgotten ' shots will go on display in @entity13 after art researchers took more than two years to track them down			1
the images of the actress relaxing during filming breaks were taken in the mid- 1950s , just as she cemented her reputation as one of the west 's most enduring sex symbols rare : some of the most arresting ' forgotten ' shots of @entity8 will go on show in @entity13 after art researchers took more than two years to find them			1
this shot was taken by sound engineer @entity28 joking around : @entity29 depicted the star with a @entity31 during the filming of @entity33 in 1953 modelling work : this image by @entity36 , a friend of the rising film star , was taken when he was hired to shoot lawn furniture with her as the model soon before the release of @entity42 in 1953 taken by five photographers , they show her leaning on a helicopter and posing jokingly with a @entity31 as she made films including @entity48 and @entity33			1
but it was not easy for photographers to capture the world 's most sought - after model - and some resorted to unorthodox means			2
one , @entity28 , famously pretended he was a @entity55 photographer in need of urgent @entity58 shots to gain half an hour of the film star 's time			1
in reality he was not a newspaper photographer at all - just a sound engineer for @entity64 with a hidden talent			1
@entity66 , the founder of @entity68 firm @entity67 , began hunting down unseen images of the film star in 2012 after seeing photographs by @entity29 of her on the set of @entity48 in @entity74			1
collection : @entity66 , the founder of @entity68 firm @entity67 , began hunting down unseen images in 2012 after seeing photographs by @entity29 of @entity8 on the set of @entity48 in @entity74 ( pictured ) relaxed : this image by @entity28 , a sound engineer who faked being a photographer for the @entity55 , showed the film star playing with a dog on film sets			1
@entity28 gained a valuable half hour of her time waiting for someone : this image by @entity85 was taken in april 1956 during filming for @entity86 during breaks from filming , the pair took pictures as a way of relaxing in the great outdoors , offering a different look to the modelled images the public would usually associate with the star			2
mr @entity66 went on to scout out unseen images from four other photographers - @entity98 , @entity85 , @entity28 and @entity36			1
' we 've spent over two - and - a - half years putting this collection together , always with an emphasis on making sure we respected @entity8 and always trying to stay true to the photographers ' visions , ' he said			2
' we see a very relaxed , casual @entity8			0
she was more herself in these pictures and did not portray the image that she later worked so hard to depict ' - curator @entity66 ' it was very exciting - i was finding photos that in many instances the photographers themselves had not seen since they were originally taken over 50 or 60 years ago			1
i was one of a few people that had ever seen these images			0
' because @entity8 did n't expect many of these photos would be published or generally seen by the public , we see a very relaxed , casual @entity8			0
' she was more herself in these pictures and did not portray the image that she later worked so hard to depict			0
' we also see her working hard at her craft with the three photos that show her working with co-star @entity122 and crew on scenes for a film			2
' people 's perception of @entity8 is that she was not a serious actress , which is far from the truth and is evident by these photos			0
' other images include the star in a white button - down , modelling lawn furniture and posing with a horse during the filming of @entity33 in 1953			2
dressing down : a relaxed shot by @entity29 of @entity8 during the filming of @entity33 in 1953 horsing around : another shot on the @entity141 showed the star with a horse in wild countryside @entity8 : the @entity145 was first seen in may when the show travelled to @entity147 and @entity148			1
it will reopen tomorrow at the @entity150 in @entity151 , running until this saturday			0
her real name @entity8 , @entity8 was 36 when she died of a barbiturate overdose in 1962			0
she was married to the baseball star @entity154 and the playwright @entity155 , and it has long been claimed she had affairs with president @entity158 and his brother @entity159			2
however , her last years were marked by illness and personal trauma			0
it has never been proved conclusively whether her death was a suicide or an accident			0
unseen : an image by @entity28			0
