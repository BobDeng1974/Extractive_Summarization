by @entity0 published : 14:37 est , 14 april 2013 updated : 14:55 est , 14 april 2013 @entity2 senator @entity1 has been tirelessly promoting a bipartisan deal on immigration legislation , saying today that the bill does n’t ‘ give anything away			1
’ ‘ we ’re not awarding anything , ’ sen. @entity1 , a @entity9 who is among the ‘ @entity12 ’ senators writing the plan expected to come out tuesday , said sunday morning on @entity7 ’ ‘ @entity13			1
’ sen. @entity1 , a @entity14 himself , insisted that the plan does not give any hand - outs , adding : ‘ all we ’re doing is giving people the opportunity to eventually earn access to our new , improved and modernized legal immigration system			1
he was also careful to say that some people currently in the country simply will not qualify under these newer , stricter laws , meaning that some of the 11 million illegal immigrants in question are riding a wave of uncertainty			0
‘ the only thing you are earning here is an opportunity to apply for temporary status , and ultimately , potentially to apply for a green card , the way everybody else does , ’ he said			0
‘ and that ’s the process that we are ou tlining			0
’ the @entity2 senator , who is considered to be an integral part of the bill , also spoke sunday on @entity29 ’s ‘ @entity28 ’ today			1
‘ what we have now is n’t good for anybody , ’ he said			0
‘ what we have in place today , the status quo , is horrible for @entity37			1
’ gang of eight : in a photo from january , sen. @entity1 , center , is pictured with sen. @entity68 , @entity69 , sen. @entity70 , @entity71 and sen. @entity72 , @entity73 , in @entity74 hot button issue : people flocked to @entity74 over the weekend for the ' @entity77 , ' where tens of thousands of immigrants and their supporters rallied for immigration reform but even among his fellow republicans , there are serious doubts			1
' i 'm not convinced , ' sen. @entity86 , an @entity87 @entity9 , said on ‘ @entity88			0
’ @entity89 high : sen. @entity1 blasted rapper @entity90 , right , about his recent trip to @entity92 sen. @entity1 says entertainers @entity94 and @entity90 missed a chance while in @entity92 to see firsthand the effects of political oppression			1
the @entity9 lawmaker from @entity2 calls their recent trip ' hypocritical ' and he takes issue with the @entity37 government 's approval of the visit as a cultural mission			1
@entity94 and @entity90 marked their wedding anniversary in @entity89 last week			2
' i think @entity90 needs to get informed , ' he said on ' @entity13 , ' calling the rapper 's trip to the island country			1
@entity37 citizens are n't allowed to travel to @entity92 for mere tourism , though they can obtain licenses for academic , religious , journalistic or cultural exchange trips			1
these people - to - people licenses were reinstated under the @entity119 administration			0
@entity1 , a @entity14 , says such trips provide money to the @entity123 government to oppress the @entity92 people			1
@entity1 discussed the trip during interviews sunday on @entity128 's ' @entity127 , ' @entity129 ' and @entity29 's ' @entity28			1
' ' i know sen. @entity1 's heart is exactly right			1
and i really respect the work of the “ @entity12			2
” but they have produced legislation ... that will give amnesty now , legalize everyone that 's here effectively today and then there 's a promise of enforcement in the future			1
' sen. @entity1 said he would abandon the overhaul effort if enforcement , border security and other elements are softened to his dissatisfaction			2
with an eye on a possible @entity151 run in 2016 , the @entity2 congressman has been careful not to appear weak on border security or create political problems among the conservatives who have great sway in picking the @entity9 's nominee			1
sen. @entity1 also told those immigrants that it would perhaps be easier if they returned to their home countries and started the process from scratch rather than use the process he is proposing			2
' so i would argue that the existing law is actually more lenient , that going back and waiting 10 years is going to be cheaper and faster that going through this process that we are outlining , ' he said			0
other lawmakers helping to write the legislation acknowledged the political challenges of the issue			0
' a lot of my conservative colleagues have significant questions and they 're legitimate , ' said sen. @entity68 , @entity173			0
' this is the start of a process , this is a vehicle that requires hearings , requires input and we welcome all of that			0
... i am guardedly optimistic that we will see finally the end of this long , long trek that a lot of us have been on for many years			0
' the measure would put millions who are in the @entity37 illegally on a 13 - year path to citizenship , while toughening border security requirements , mandating that all employers check the legal status of workers , and allowing tens of thousands of new high - and low - skilled workers into the country with new visa programs			1
the legislation is expected to include a new emphasis on merit - based immigration over family ties			2
' this is a very balanced bill			0
the @entity37 people have told us to do two things : one , prevent future flows of illegal immigration ; and then , come up with a common - sense solution for legal immigration			2
and that 's what our bill does , ' said sen. @entity70 , @entity73 - @entity213			0
the senator also appeared on ' @entity215 ' ' @entity216 , ' @entity128 's ' @entity127 ' , and ' @entity217 '			2
' he also was booked on the @entity219 - language networks @entity220 and @entity221			0
@entity86 and @entity70 were on @entity7 while sen. @entity68 appeared on @entity128			0
