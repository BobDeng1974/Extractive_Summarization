drinking , smoking or eating badly could put a baby 's health at risk - years before it is conceived drinking , smoking or eating badly could put your baby ’s health at risk - years before it is conceived			1
the latest research suggests that a wild lifestyle in your teens or 20s could come back to haunt you if you become a parent later			0
scientists say there is now ‘ overwhelming evidence ’ that poor health can be recorded in a father ’s sperm or a mother ’s eggs			1
obesity or other problems caused by lifestyle can then be passed on to the next generation - making a baby ‘ pre-programmed ’ for a life of poor health , researchers say			1
leading @entity24 scientists , building on a decade of research into the way health can be passed between generations , said there is a clear message for prospective mothers and fathers : ‘ parenting starts before conception			1
’ professor @entity35 of the @entity36 said : ‘ people used to think that lifestyle did n’t matter , because a child represented a new beginning , with a fresh start			0
‘ the reality is we can now say with great certainty that the child does n’t quite start from scratch – they already carry over a legacy of factors from their parents ’ experiences that can shape development in the foetus and after birth			0
‘ depending on the situation , we can give our children a burden before they ’ve even started life			0
’ the research , published in the journal @entity60 , suggests that babies whose parents had poor lifestyles before conception were more likely to have health problems such as diabetes , heart issues and immune disorders			1
professor @entity70 said : ‘ many things we do in the lead up to conceiving is having an impact on the future development of the child – from the age of the parents , to poor diet , obesity , smoking and many other factors , all of which influence environmental signals transmitted into the embryo			1
’ the biggest impact for both men and women is caused by their behaviour in the final three months before conception , when sperm and eggs both undergo final developments			2
but lifestyle and events that take place many years before could also have a dramatic impact , the scientists think			0
until recently , scientific thinking relied on the @entity102 evolutionary theory that a baby ’s fate is set in stone many years before the child is conceived			1
the sequence of two parents ’ dna , itself set by their own parents , effectively predetermined every aspect of a baby ’s nature and make - up , the old thinking held			1
but the latest research has led to a more subtle understanding of genetics , which accepts that tiny changes are made to an individual ’s genes by smoking , diet and other environmental factors that we come across in everyday life			2
scientists say there is now ' overwhelming evidence ' that poor health can be recorded in a father 's sperm or a mother 's eggs those ‘ epigenetic ’ changes can be passed on to the next generation via the egg or sperm			1
scientists think the ability to pass those epigenetic factors to a baby lies in the evolutionary need to adapt to changing environment			0
it means , for example , that if a man or woman experience a period of famine , their genes are altered by the ‘ memory ’ of that hard time so their baby is able to cope with less food			2
but if that baby goes on to eat normal amounts , their body can not cope with the abundance and they can develop metabolic diseases such as diabetes			0
conversely , if a parent overeats in life , the baby adapts to expect lots of food			0
when they do not get it health problems are the result			0
professor @entity70 said it is not all bad news for would - be parents			0
‘ a few lifestyle changes by potential parents and improvements in the right direction , especially in the months leading up to conception , could have a lasting , positive benefit for the future of their child , ’ she said .			2

drinking , smoking or eating badly could put a baby ’s health at risk
there is now ' overwhelming evidence ' that poor health can be recorded in a father ’s sperm or a mother ’s eggs , say @entity24 researchers
‘ parenting starts before conception ' , they warn
