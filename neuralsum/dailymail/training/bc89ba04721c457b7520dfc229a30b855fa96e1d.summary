by @entity0 published : 13:14 est , 4 march 2014 updated : 09:18 est , 5 march 2014 a section of the @entity3 has been set aside for graffiti in a bid to save other parts being vandalised by tourists			1
authorities chose a popular stretch of the ancient monument where visitors can scrawl their names in the hope it will stop the spread of graffiti			1
most of the graffiti is written in @entity17 , with phrases like ' i was ' ere ' and notices saying who to call ' for a good time ' common			2
it is one of the most popular tourist spots along the wall			1
the graffiti section will be set up at one of the fighting towers that has become a common place there for tourists to scrawl on the walls			1
it attracts millions of tourists per year , 40 per cent of whom are estimated to be foreigners , which explains why most of the graffiti is in @entity17			1
graffiti has long been a problem with @entity55 scenic sites , and has sparked innovative responses from authorities			1
officials in @entity59 set up touch - screen graffiti platforms to keep visitors from carving their initials into a local pagoda			1
the minders of the @entity3 are reportedly also considering ' an electronic graffiti board , ' to hopefully cut down on permanent desecration of the site			2
i was ' ere : former @entity70 president @entity69 visited the section with first lady @entity72 and daughter @entity74 in june 1998 the original @entity3 dates back to seventh century @entity55 , but the section in @entity76 was rebuilt more than 500 years ago in 1484 during the @entity77			2
the wall has been constantly rebuilt and repaired throughout history			2
an expert said : ' like any building project , some work lasts longer than others			0
' still one of the only man made objects visible from space , the wall is made of stone , brick , tamped earth , wood , and other materials			2
@entity55 authorities have been trying to find new ways to tackle the problem of graffiti on the @entity3			1
pictured here is the @entity25 near @entity33 sections of the @entity3 north of @entity33 and near tourist centres , such as @entity25 , have been preserved and even extensively renovated but in many locations the @entity102 is in disrepair			1
in poorer parts of the country the @entity102 is sometimes used as a village playground or is used as a source of stones for rebuilding houses and roads			0
sections have also been affected by graffiti and vandalism			2
other parts have been destroyed to make way for construction			0
more than 37 miles in the @entity119 province may disappear in the next two decades , due to erosion from sandstorms			0
in parts , the height of the wall has been reduced from more than 16ft to less than six feet			0
the iconic square - shaped lookout towers that form the most famous images of the wall have disappeared completely			1
many western sections of the wall are constructed from mud , rather than brick and stone , and are therefore more susceptible to erosion			0
it was built along an east - to - west line across the historical northern borders of @entity55 in part to protect the @entity136 against attack by various nomadic groups or military incursions by various warlike peoples or forces			1
in addition to acting as a shield against border enemies the @entity3 was also used to enforce duties on goods transported along the @entity147 , to regulate or encourage trade and control immigration and emigration			0
troop barracks , garrison stations , signaling capabilities through smoke or fire also helped to enhance the walls defensive characteristics			0
the @entity102 goes from @entity158 in the east , to @entity160 in the west , an area that loosely represents the southern edge of @entity163			0
the entire length , which includes trenches and natural barriers such as hills and rivers , stretches to 5,500 miles			0
although other experts have concluded that if branches of the wall are included its entire length is around 14,000 miles			1
the first wall construction is thought to date from the 7th century @entity175 especially famous is the wall built between 220 â€“ 206 bc by the first @entity177 , @entity178			0
@entity179 of that wall remains			0
since then , the @entity3 has on and off been rebuilt , maintained , and enhanced ; the majority of the existing wall was reconstructed during the @entity77 in the 15th century .			0

authorities have been fighting a constant battle against graffiti
they chose a popular stretch of the wall to let tourists write on
it is hoped allowing graffiti there will stop it spreading elsewhere
the section chosen at @entity25 is 43 miles north - east of @entity33
