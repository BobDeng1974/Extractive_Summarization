i think i know the location of $ 20million worth of stolen art - i hope you have @entity5			1
' it 's a line that would n't sound out of place in a heist movie			0
but that was the anonymous call that helped art sleuth @entity10 , 53 , track down nine paintings including works by @entity14 and @entity15 stolen from an @entity17 mansion			1
' i got this tip - off from a shadowy figure in @entity20 called @entity1 , ' said the @entity22 - based founder of @entity23			1
' the art detective is no stranger to high profile cases – having been central to the recovery of a £ 1billion @entity42 - looted hoard found in a squalid @entity43 flat in 2012			1
he currently represents the heirs of renowned art dealer @entity45 in their bid to recover @entity27 's @entity47			2
it was discovered amongst other priceless works in a flat owned by @entity51 , the son of @entity42 art dealer @entity52 , and has been valued at around £ 60million			1
he is representing the heirs of art dealer @entity45 in their bid to recover @entity27 's @entity55 ( left ) which was found in a squalid @entity43 apartment along with this @entity14 painting ( right ) ' the painting was found covered by a layer of grime			1
there was a milky white film on it as it had been sitting flat , unstretched amongst rotting food , ' said mr @entity10			1
' it did n't even have a frame , but there is no doubt that it is the original @entity27			0
it has been tested by a number of experts and the @entity45 family has an incredibly detailed archive			0
' it should clean up nicely and we were able to determine it has not been directly touched since @entity27 completed it			0
' the reclusive eccentric died in may last year and left the collection dubbed the ' greatest find of the post-war era ' to @entity81			0
the museum announced that it would accept the immense trove of art amassed by a @entity42 - era art dealer , but would ensure any looted art was returned to the rightful owners			1
and just yesterday it emerged that @entity89 has signed an agreement to return @entity27 's @entity91 to the @entity45 heirs			2
in the past two decades , mr @entity10 has tracked down £ 250million worth of stolen art including priceless works by @entity95 , @entity96 and @entity27			1
the founder of @entity23 examines evidence relating to @entity27 's @entity28 with head curator @entity99 he tracked down nine paintings including @entity101 by @entity14 ( pictured ) stolen from an @entity17 mansion one of his most recent cases saw him recover @entity104 ' , which was seized from @entity106 's collection by the @entity107 in @entity108			1
mr @entity106 , a prominent art collector , had fled to @entity109 with his wife @entity110 six years before , when @entity111 was annexed into @entity89 as part of the @entity113 in 1938			2
last month mr @entity10 also tracked down two sculptures which were stolen with weeks of each other from @entity116 and @entity117 in @entity118 32 years ago			1
@entity120 's ' @entity119 ' was taken during an exhibition in december 1983 and just three weeks later ' figure of @entity123 ' by prince @entity124 disappeared from the same show			0
another of his most high - profile successes was the recovery of @entity27 's @entity28 after it was stolen from the @entity129 in @entity130 by a burglar armed with a sledgehammer			1
more than 1,400 artworks were found in a squalid @entity43 flat owned by @entity51 , the son of @entity42 art dealer @entity52 criminals are both nemeses and friends to the detective and if you spot him sitting in a @entity142 , the chances are he 's about to sit down with an art thief			1
' i 've met with a criminal who 's been holding onto some very valuable artwork for over 30 years several times at a cafe in @entity109 , ' said mr @entity10			1
' i often receive and exchange stolen works in pubs and cafes			2
in fact if you see me sitting alone in a @entity142 , there is a high likelihood i 'm not just having a cup of coffee			0
i prefer meeting in public places , as it can get interesting			0
' i deal with criminals if i have the permission of the authorities			0
if the theft happened 25 years ago , the police are n't as interested and in those cases i 'm given permission to handle the case myself			2
' before he became the public face of the company , he used to work undercover and once set up a sting operation to catch a man trying to illegally obtain a @entity176 picture worth £ 2million			1
he has also recovered a multi-million pound @entity178 painting from the middle of the street in @entity182 from a celebrity who unwittingly came into possession of the stolen artwork			2
' i was meeting a well - known celebrity at the corner of a street in @entity118 and suddenly a beige @entity189 pulled up and the window rolled down			2
out came a @entity178 painting rolled up in a tube inside a black plastic bag			0
' that is definitely one of the more unusual places i have exchanged artwork			0
' finding the missing art in the first place is a major undertaking as mr @entity10 and his team often locate stolen works before law enforcement			1
to do this , they have developed @entity208 , the world 's most technologically advanced database for stolen , looted and missing works of art , antiquity and cultural property			1
once a missing artwork is entered into the database , they use image recognition software to scour catalogues at @entity220 , @entity221 's , @entity222 and other auction sites until they find a match			0
' it all starts with @entity208			0
anyone who has a theft whether it 's a museum or holocaust victim should report the theft , then we search art fairs , online sellers , and auction catalogues			1
' there is a huge risk in buying a stolen work as the legal fees can be back breaking			2
the publicity alone can be hugely damaging to a high net - worth collector			1
' people spend hundreds of thousands and do absolutely nothing to check the provenance			0
you need to know in advance what you 're buying			0
' mr @entity10 believes art theft is on the rise and said it is now the third highest - grossing criminal trade , behind guns and drugs			1
@entity51 's father @entity52 ( right ) , was commissioned to obtain artworks on behalf of @entity256 ( left ) and bought works confiscated from @entity259 families ' it is worse than ever			2
the economic downturn over the past few years , security cuts at museums and wars have all contributed to the fact that cultural property theft is on the rise			2
' but @entity269 - style art heists with @entity271 - style equipment and elaborate getaways are not the only way that priceless works disappear			1
' @entity23 is stolen in every way imaginable , but it is not always a well thought - out endeavor			1
' some thieves just see a work and think ' i can just put this in my bag and get out of here '			0
' what they do n't realise is that these works are not at all easy to sell on			0
once an artwork is on our database - as this one is - we will be searching art markets all over the world for it			1
' @entity23 can also be lost in transport and there is also insider theft			2
of course there are also movie - style elaborate break - ins			0
methods are getting creative , but we are trying to stay one step ahead			0
' ' thieves are always going to be thieves			0
art thieves are common thugs			0
there 's no romance there			0
the same people who 'd steal your wallet would steal artwork			0
' the internet has made it easier track but it 's easier for the criminals as well			0
