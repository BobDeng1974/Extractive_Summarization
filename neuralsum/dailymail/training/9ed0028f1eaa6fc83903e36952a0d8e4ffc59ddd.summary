to date the most populated planetary system that we know of is that around the @entity2 , which is thought to have nine planets in total			1
the planets , however , are inhospitable to life as we know it , ranging from hot super-earths to gas giants bigger than @entity10			0
but could there exist a system with many , many more planets than this – with dozens of them habitable ? that ’s what one astronomer has calculated , and he says it ’s theoretically possible a system could exist with 60 worlds life could exist on			1
astronomer dr @entity23 has devised an ' ultimate solar system ' ( shown ) that could have as many as 60 habitable worlds			1
to create the theoretical model he considered the stars , planets and orbits that would be required to allow as many @entity31 - like worlds as possible to exist dr @entity23 , an astronomer at the @entity33 in @entity34 , @entity32 has revealed how to build a so - called ‘ ultimate solar system ’ at @entity36			1
his self - appointed task was to build a planetary system with the most habitable worlds possible that could survive for billions of years			1
to do so he considered the kind of star that would be needed , the types of planets and the logistics of the orbits			2
‘ with the ultimate @entity48 i wanted to come up with a fun idea to get people thinking about this stuff , ’ @entity23 tells @entity46 in an email			0
‘ and everyone is interested in astronomy and planets so it 's a fun way to use your imagination			0
‘ i do n't claim to have the absolute best answer			0
still , with just these relatively simple pieces it 's easy to build a very rich system ! ’ in choosing a star @entity23 opted for one about half the size and mass of the sun at the hotter end of the ‘ red dwarf ’ spectrum			2
this , he says , would create a system that will survive longer than our own with a fairly tight habitable zone , the area around a star within which it is neither too hot nor too cold for water , and possibly life , to form			2
next he considered what types of planets would create the most hospitable environments in a packed planetary system			1
‘ we want planets that are not too small , big , dry or wet , ’ he writes			0
‘ we want planets with atmospheres , surfaces , oceans and continents			0
‘ this translates to worlds between about half and twice the size of @entity31 , with between ten times less and ten times more water than @entity31			0
’ the first of the two planetary systems that would fit into @entity23 's final design would have 24 habitable worlds			1
these would each be binary earths in trojan orbits ( ones that trail another ) around their central star , a red dwarf smaller and slightly less hot than the sun to date @entity105 has found many potentially habitable worlds outside the solar system , but most have been so - called super-earths that are much larger than our own world			1
the habitability of these planets is not well understood but , if they reside in the habitable zone of their host star , it is possible they could have liquid water the @entity121 , or habitable zone , is the belt around a star where temperatures are ideal for liquid water to pool on a planet 's surface			2
to determine the location of a star 's habitable zone , scientists have to first learn how much total radiation it emits			2
they can calculate this by knowing the size and type of the star			0
they can then estimate a region where it might not be too hot or too cold for water to form			0
the final step was to find suitable orbits for the planets to inhabit			0
@entity23 says there are two possible configurations for a solar system packed with habitable planets			1
this first is one that includes multiple binary planets , two @entity31 - sized planets orbiting one another as they orbit their sun. within the habitable zone of the star specified earlier , @entity23 envisages six orbital bands , with two binary planet systems per orbit			1
each pair of systems would be known as a ‘ trojan ’ pair , which means one trails the other in the orbit			0
in our solar system there are what are known as trojan asteroids , which trail the orbit of @entity172			2
in total this system would therefore have 24 habitable worlds			2
some of these worlds would have different amounts of water and different sizes to each other but @entity23 says they would all be habitable			0
in the second configuration he considers a system that not only has binary planets , but gas giant planets with @entity31 - sized moons in orbit as well			1
this is similar to our own solar system , where @entity172 has four large moons approaching the size of @entity31 and @entity192 has one			1
in such a system , to remain gravitationally stable , there would be four orbital bands			0
on each would be two binary systems and one gas giant with five @entity31 - sized moons in orbit , again with trojan orbits			2
this system would have a grand total of 36 habitable worlds			1
the other component system of @entity23 's ultimate solar system would have , in addition to binary planets , four gas giants each with five @entity31 - sized moons in orbit			1
in this model @entity23 says there would be a total of 36 habitable worlds which , when combined with the other system , gives a total of 60 the discovery of @entity215 , the first @entity31 - sized world to be found orbiting in the habitable zone of a star , was announced back in april			1
this world is the best bet so far for a planet that could not only support water on its surface but life as well in some form @entity23 then says that if the two systems were in a binary star system separate by about 100 @entity229 ( 100 times the @entity31 - sun distance ) , it would create the ultimate solar system with 60 habitable planets			1
‘ the ultimate solar system is scientifically valid , ’ @entity23 continues to @entity46			1
‘ each piece has either been directly observed or has been inferred from theoretical work			0
‘ for example , the @entity236 and @entity237 systems are planets with nearly equal - sized moons			0
‘ we know of plenty of planets in the habitable zones of their host stars			0
‘ and computer simulations tell us that trojan configurations might be common in planetary systems , and that large moons may form readily around giant planets ( although exactly how large is debated )			1
but , @entity23 concedes , the chances of such a system are slim , although not non-existant			0
‘ packing so many habitable worlds into one system may be a bit of a stretch			0
‘ having all of these pieces in the same system in the right combination is probably not all that common			0
’ he also says there could be theoretical systems with more than 60 habitable worlds , but for now his model is the most scientifically viable .			2

dr @entity23 has unveiled his theoretical model of a planetary system
and he says it is possible a solar system could have up to 60 @entity31
to create the model he considered the types of star , planet and orbit
the total system would be two binary stars with two planetary systems
one would have 36 habitable planets and the other would have 24
such a system is not likely to be common but could exist , says @entity23
