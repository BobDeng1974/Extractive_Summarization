@entity0 , unadulterated acceleration with gears to spare			2
it ’s what makes @entity6 a track icon and its pursuit fuels the multi-million pound @entity9 circuit			2
it was the also the underlying theme of a memorable opening day at the biggest flat meeting of the season			2
twice @entity14 experienced that wind in the hair feeling most of us can only expect on a roller - coaster			1
first odds - on favourite @entity21 carried him up the straight mile faster than the dual champion claimed he could ever recall to land the @entity24 by three - quarters of length from @entity26 , giving new trainer @entity27 a winner at this meeting with his first runner			1
hail the new king : @entity32 and @entity33 sweep past long - time leader @entity34 to win in devastating style then @entity37 , in the words of @entity14 , ‘ made up ‘ five lengths in 50 yards ’ to capture the @entity40 for the second successive year			1
but @entity14 , riding 2,000 @entity41 , was left facing the back draft from the most spectacular burst of pace as @entity32 and @entity33 engaged the after - burner and flew to victory in the @entity46			1
when the pair had met in the @entity49 at @entity50 , it had been @entity34 who won but the tactical nature of the race had left questions hanging in the air as to who really was the best			1
when @entity32 subsequently romped home in the @entity59 , the debate became even louder			0
@entity33 turns around to taunt his rivals as @entity32 proves much the best in the @entity46 @entity14 tried to tactically wrong - foot his younger weighing room rival by unexpectedly making the running on @entity34 but it proved a fruitless gesture as @entity32 ’s demolition – the two - and - a - quarter - length margin does not do his superiority justice – emphatically settled the argument over who is the best			1
in his moment of triumph , @entity33 spontaneously turned to his rivals , putting his finger to his lips			0
afterwards , he admitted to be touch embarrassed by the gesture			0
he need not have been			0
he had just been part of one of those sporting moments that send a frisson of excitement down the spine			0
it was the sort of ride @entity33 must have hoped for when last summer he was signed up by @entity32 ’s owner @entity82 and one probably not seen at @entity83 since another colt carrying the @entity82 silks , a certain @entity86 , blitzed his way to victory in the 2012 @entity24			1
@entity33 said : ‘ i probably let my emotions get the better of me crossing the line as i got so much satisfaction from that			0
all smiles : @entity33 could n't hide his joy at @entity32 's stellar performance ‘ a lot horse has been said about the @entity49 and it just proves he is the best three - year - old over a mile			2
‘ i was very confident today			0
i did n’t think @entity34 could beat us			1
‘ everyone thought he was n’t a champion after the @entity49 but he has put that well behind him now			0
’ @entity104 , winning the @entity46 for the first time , added : ‘ despite losing in the @entity49 i always took the opinion he was the better horse			1
you push an button and he is away			0
’ @entity104 will now aim @entity32 at next month ’s @entity110 at @entity111 lining up a heavyweight clash with @entity21 , who justified all the bold words of @entity27 in the build up to the meeting			1
horse power : @entity37 ( left ) showed a devastating turn of foot to hit the front in the final furlong @entity37 could make a much quicker reappearance with trainer @entity122 considering running the sprinter alongside stablemate @entity124 in saturday ’s @entity126			1
@entity127 have signed up @entity128 to add some pizzazz to their under scrutiny coverage so it was appropriate the @entity131 should land the @entity132 on @entity134 - trained @entity133			0
@entity128 , who drew a blank at this meeting last year , needs only two more wins to make it 50 at the royal meeting			0
on a day when pace was king , @entity143 flyer hootenanny was provided the perfect finale to win the @entity145 , justifying trainer @entity147 ’s belief that colt was the best chance of six runners at the meeting			2
@entity152 takes 48th @entity83 win			0
