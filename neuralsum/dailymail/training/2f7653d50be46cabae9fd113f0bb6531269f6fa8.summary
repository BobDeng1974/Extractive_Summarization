just one in four students leave university with the highest levels of reading and writing , according to a new international study			1
while increasing numbers of people are going on to higher education , the majority do not reach the highest standards in literacy , according to the @entity12 ’s , annual education report			1
@entity14 , the organisation ’s director for education and skills , said the findings show that while more people in the @entity21 are gaining qualifications , this is not being matched by improved skills in reading and writing			2
he suggested this was similar with numeracy			0
graduates : just one in four students leave university with the highest levels of reading and writing , according to a new international study ( file picture ) the latest education at a glance study reveals that a student in the @entity21 is now more likely to go to university than they are to finish their education on leaving school			1
in 2012 , around two in five 25 to 64 - year - olds ( 41per cent ) held a degree or equivalent qualification , while 37per cent stopped studying after gaining their gcses or a-levels			1
it also shows that in 2012 , the last year for which data is available , 48per cent of @entity21 young people aged 25 to 34 had been to university or college , compared to 33per cent of 55 to 64 - year - olds			1
but while more people are continuing their education , the report suggests that this is not reflected in better basic skills			1
the data , which draws on international tests conducted by the @entity12 , shows that just 25per cent of graduates in @entity58 and @entity59 have the highest levels of ability in literacy			2
study : literacy and numeracy skills can reflect what a student has learnt at school , before they go on to higher education , and universities may assume that students already have these abilities in many high - performing countries , including @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 , the @entity79 and @entity80 , more than a third of graduates are performing at this level			1
' on the one hand in the @entity21 you can say qualification levels have risen enormously , lots more people are getting tertiary qualifications , university degrees , but actually not all of that is visible in better skills , ' mr @entity14 said			2
' in the @entity21 , it ’s at best a middle position , ' he suggested			0
' i think that ’s something , quality and degrees do not always align			0
' he added : ' there ’s also a big distribution in outcomes			0
what ’s interesting is when you look at people with tertiary qualifications , there ’s a lot of variability in the skills those people have attained			0
' not all further education qualifications really deserve that name because often those individuals are not actually better skilled than people who have just come out of school			0
' the figures cover not just university degrees , but any type of higher level , or ' tertiary ' qualification			2
performance : in high - performing countries , including @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 , the @entity79 and @entity80 , more than a third of graduates are performing at the highest literacy level mr @entity14 said that he would have expected the @entity21 to perform better at the highest levels of literacy			1
' @entity21 universities have a very strong reputation - you would have expected this stronger prevalence among the most highly skilled people			0
' in general , literacy and numeracy skills can reflect what a student has learnt at school , before they go on to higher education , mr @entity14 said , adding that universities may assume that students already have these abilities , when they could be improved			1
the latest report shows that around a third of 25 to 34 - year - olds in @entity58 and @entity59 have achieved a higher level of education than their mothers and fathers , but adds that parents ’ level of education still has a strong influence on a child ’s educational achievement			1
an individual in @entity58 and @entity59 whose parents hold a degree is more than six times more likely to go into higher education than someone whose parents did not gain their gcses			1
it adds that greater access to higher education does not necessarily lead to better social mobility - essentially more poorer students going on to study for a degree			1
@entity169 background is still a key factor in going into higher education , it is suggested			1
the @entity12 also found that the @entity21 is one of very few countries to have worked out a sustainable approach to funding higher education , through fees and loans			1
however , this is based on the old system , before fees were tripled to a maximum of £ 9,000 per year			0
education and childcare minister @entity179 said : ' we are committed to providing flexible , affordable and good quality childcare , giving parents more of a choice about where they send their children , so that they can get the best start in life			2
' as a result of our plan for education more families than ever before are now eligible for free childcare , including 15 free hours a week for all three and four - year - olds and , from next year , tax free childcare of up to £ 2,000 per child			1
' the benefits of good quality childcare can last a child a lifetime and are especially crucial for children who are from more disadvantaged backgrounds to stop them falling behind their peers			0
' this is why we ’ve also extended free childcare to the 40 % most disadvantaged children and introduced the @entity207			0
' big classes ' mean better teachers ' : bigger @entity21 class sizes mean teachers are better paid class sizes in the @entity21 are bigger than many other countries , but this may be because there is more focus on the quality of teachers			0
there are around 21 pupils per teacher in @entity21 primary schools and 16 students for each teacher in secondaries , according to the @entity12 ’s annual education report			2
this is higher than the @entity12 averages of 15 children per teacher in primary education and 13 students for every teacher in secondary education			2
numbers : there are around 21 pupils per teacher in @entity21 primary schools and 16 students for each teacher in secondaries , according to the @entity12 it means that the @entity21 effectively has larger class sizes than many other countries including @entity76 , @entity242 , @entity243 and the @entity244			1
but @entity14 , the @entity12 ’s director for education and skills , said that nations may have to make a ' trade - off ' between smaller classes and paying teachers more , and many high - performing countries choose the latter			1
' you can spend your money only once , so if you have a fixed amount of money that ’s the kind of trade - off you have to make , ' he said			0
he added : ' basically smaller classes limit your capacity to pay teachers better , and that ’s the trade - off you can see in the data			0
' mr @entity14 said that as far as the @entity21 was concerned , in upper secondary education , decisions over class sizes and teachers are consistent with what is seen in many high - performing countries			2
' @entity77 will be doing the same , @entity78 will be doing the same , @entity269 , @entity270			0
all those countries prioritise teaching and teachers over infrastructure and class size			0
' the report also shows that in the early years , or nursery education , there are around 19 children per teacher , higher than the @entity12 average of 14 pupils per teacher			0
the figures cover teachers only , and do not include teaching assistants or other school and nursery staff			0
mr @entity14 said that the @entity21 uses a lot of non-teaching staff in nursery schools , adding that in many other countries there are more teachers in early years education .			0

study finds majority of students do not reach the highest literacy standards
more are going to university , but this is not reflected in improved basic skills
in countries such as @entity76 more than a third reach highest level of ability
around two in five 25 to 64 - year - olds now hold a degree or equivalent
a third of 25 to 34 - year - olds reach higher education level than their parents
