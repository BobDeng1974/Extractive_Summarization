a couple who were spared jail after they broke a toddler ’s leg , foot and arms will have their sentence reviewed by the government after a petition to put them behind bars was started - by a disgusted friend			1
@entity14 and partner @entity15 , both 27 , left the injured youngster for two days before taking the child to hospital			1
@entity19 was also convicted of slapping a baby in the face before @entity15 violently shook it			1
a judge sparked national outrage after he handed the couple , from @entity26 , @entity27 , suspended sentences of two years because it was their first offence and @entity15 was ' hardworking '			1
spared jail : @entity14 , 27 , and her partner @entity15 , also 27 , were given a 36 - week prison sentence suspended for two years after being convicted of child cruelty and neglect			1
but a petition , signed by 1,000 , could see them put behind bars recorder @entity38 also ordered @entity15 to complete 100 hours of unpaid work when they were convicted on may 24			1
now their sentence could be reviewed after 1,000 people signed a petition calling on the pair to be jailed			1
the online petition was started by @entity19 ’s former friend @entity48			1
ms @entity48 , 29 , also from @entity26 , was so appalled at the lenient sentence she also wrote to the government demanding the couple were jailed			1
the attorney general today asked the @entity53 to pass on details about the case			0
a decision will then be made on whether to send the case to the @entity58 for a sentence review			0
a spokesman for the attorney general ’s office said : ' we have asked the @entity53 for more information to decide whether the sentence should be referred to the @entity58 for review			0
' the power to refer sentences is subject to a strict 28 - day time limit from the day of sentencing			0
' this case is within that time limit and either the attorney or the solicitor general will make their decision in due course			0
' the couple could be jailed for a maximum of ten years			1
at the lower end of the scale , the guidelines state a sentence of anything between 12 weeks in custody to a community order can be imposed for offences involving short - term neglect or ill - treatment , a single incident of short - term abandonment or a failure to protect a child			2
staff found the toddler 's leg had been broken for at least two days before it was brought in to the @entity94 ms @entity48 , who started the petition after she acted as a prosecution witness during the trial , said : ' people here are absolutely disgusted with the sentence and they both deserve to be jailed			1
' the sentence is unbelievable			0
it ’s like the judge is sending out a message to say that it ’s ok to be cruel to children			0
' drink - drivers get sent straight down , but these two have been allowed to walk free			0
' i ’m glad the attorney general has listened to the protests and i hope it leads to them being given a proper sentence - in prison			0
' @entity114 , landlord of the @entity116 pub in nearby @entity117 , said : ' @entity15 used to come here but he ’s certainly not welcome anymore			1
' to say it ’s their first offence can hardly be a reason to treat them leniently			0
what they did is disgusting and they should have been jailed			2
' @entity125 - on - @entity126 heard x-rays revealed the child had suffered a catalogue of fractures to both arms , both legs , the left foot and left shoulder			2
at the trial , @entity135 told them : ' you ’ve both been convicted of very serious offences and you ’re going to have to live with the consequences			2
' offences of cruelty and ill - treatment of children are so serious that the courts have to send out a message to people that , if convicted , serious sentences will follow			1
' the couple were spared jail after the judge heard how the defendants had no previous convictions			1
@entity154 , defending , also said @entity19 had experienced a ' troubled ' past and had been cared for by 14 different foster families as a child			2
he said : ' her actions amounted to a temporary loss of temper			0
' @entity161 , defending @entity15 added : ' he is , and was , a hard - working individual			2
he understands the consequences of this conviction will last forever			0
' the court heard the couple attacked the toddler , who was taken to @entity94 with serious injuries			2
on arriving at hospital , shocked doctors found the child ’s right leg had been broken at least two days earlier			1
@entity173 , prosecuting , said : ' neither defendant could account for how that injury was caused			0
the medical staff were concerned and a full radiological survey was carried out			0
' the whole body was x-rayed and it was discovered the child had a number of significant injuries to its bones			0
' the child had fractures to both arms , both legs , left foot and left shoulder , all of which , it was deemed by the medical staff , were non-accidental injuries and were caused deliberately to the child			0
' @entity19 and @entity15 have now fled the area .			2
