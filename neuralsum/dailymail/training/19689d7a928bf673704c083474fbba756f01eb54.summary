by @entity0 published : 14:16 est , 31 july 2013 updated : 01:45 est , 1 august 2013 @entity1 is the new black author @entity2 says her time behind bars taught her that justice in @entity5 depends on income and skin color			1
ms @entity2 's memoir about her 13 - month stint in federal prison is now a hit @entity12 series starring @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15			1
' my time in the @entity5 criminal justice system made very real to me the huge inequality amongst @entity5 , ' ms @entity2 said in a new interview with @entity21			1
' ms @entity2 's very brief life of crime began shortly after graduating from @entity35 , when she smuggled a suitcase full of drug money for her then - girlfriend , a high - end heroin importer			1
her crime caught up to her a few years later , and she was sentenced to 15 months behind bars , which was reduced for good behavior			1
' i think that i had to discover and rely on my best self to survive the prison system , ' ms @entity2 said			1
after wondering if she would ' be pegged the snotty rich bitch ' after seeing ' very @entity48 ' dorms with names like ' @entity50 ' , ' @entity51 ' and ' @entity52 ' , she quickly figured out that her best chance of survival was learning to fit in			0
' the lessons i learned that stick with me i gleaned from the women i did time with , not from the correctional system , which teaches people how to be prisoners and little else , ' she says			0
new series : actress @entity13 's character @entity62 in the @entity12 series is based on ms @entity2 's real - life experiences she says that it was the sense of community that made her time behind bars bearable			1
small acts of kindness , like a fellow prisoner buying her a root beer float when she could n't access her commissary account , take on seismic importance			0
while most prisoners do not have a high school education , @entity2 had a degree , access to good lawyers and a fiance who wrote @entity81 editorials about her plight			1
' was i going to be pegged the snotty rich bitch ? my time in the @entity5 criminal justice system made very real to me the huge inequality amongst @entity5 ' i was mercifully not subjected to prison healthcare , ' she says , adding @entity12 scene in which a woman is strapped to a bed and forced to take anti-psychotic medication is n't that far removed from reality			1
' i believe that prisoners who do not want to take medication can be forced to comply with prison healthcare orders			2
' she also got an up close and personal look at the cycle of addiction , and understand the role her crime played in the drug trade that affected so many of their lives			2
despite the differences , ms @entity2 began to discover how closely their lives were linked - and could tell their story in a relatable way			1
@entity109 lost : @entity14 ( left ) plays @entity2 's ex-girlfriend who introduced her to the drug trade show creator @entity112 has said : ' you know , you 're not gon na go into a network and say , " i want to talk about black women and @entity118 women and old women in prison			1
" you need a way in			0
she was our gateway drug			2
' ' i believe that prisoners who do not want to take medication can be forced to comply with prison healthcare orders ' the show also depicts the lighter moments and sometimes - bizarre prison routines			2
some used prescription medicines and cigarettes to pass the time ; ms @entity2 took up @entity135			2
to battle boredom she also gossiped , read , microwaved ' prison cheesecake ' from stolen butter , got prison pedicures from a fellow inmate , and discovered feminine hygiene products could be to macgyver everything from mops to makeshift dildos			0
behind bars : the characters ms @entity2 met during her 15 - month stint behind bars are fleshed out much more fully in the @entity12 series ' we mainly used them as cleaning implements , ' she admitted			1
' i was impressed with the show 's use of them in costuming			0
' she still thinks about her time in prison - and the women she spent time with - every day and stays in touch with many of them			2
' i have been in touch with the friends i made in prison , some for many years , and some have been in touch since the book published or the show aired , ' she says			0
' i am very grateful for these friendships			0
' since her release , ms @entity2 has become an advocate for prison reform through work with organizations including the @entity176			1
she admits that she was lucky : a friend created a job for her in his company			0
most women , she says , do n't have that option			0
' the biggest obstacle for people coming home to live a legal life is getting a job ; so employment programs that teach real skills and connect people to opportunity on the outside would make a huge difference , ' she explains			0
' however , it would be most effective to invest in education and employment opportunity earlier , so we do nâ€™t spend huge sums on prisons and jails in the first place			0
' she 's also gone from threatening to drown her ex-girlfriend in a toilet to forgiving her - and forgiving herself			0
she wrote : ' if i could forgive myself , i could prove that i was a strong , good person who could take responsibility for the path that i had chosen for myself , and all the consequences of that action			0
