by @entity0 last updated at 10:36 am on 7th july 2011 it was an announcement that carried with it all the depressing hallmarks of a feckless broken family in the making			0
after a relationship at school teenagers @entity7 , 13 , and his 15 - year - old girlfriend @entity8 revealed they were expecting a child			1
yet , almost a decade on , the couple have defied the nay - sayers and turned the negative stereotypes on their head			0
setting an example : @entity8 , 24 , and @entity7 , 22 , with children @entity17 , 11 months , @entity19 , eight , and @entity20 , three not only are they still together , they have added to their family and now plan to marry			1
and , shunning a life on benefits , after staying at school to pass his exams , @entity7 has worked full - time to support his family			1
when little @entity19 arrived in 2003 , @entity8 , by then aged 16 , left school but attended council - run classes for teenage mothers while living at home in @entity33 , which has an above average teenage pregnancy rate			1
@entity7 , who was then 14 and also lived with his parents , stayed on to pass six gcses , including one at a grade			1
he began working as soon as he was able , first washing dishes at a restaurant after his classes			0
' he 'd come home from school , spend time with me and @entity19 , change out of his school uniform and go to work as a dishwasher , ' @entity8 , now 24 , said yesterday			2
@entity8 , aged 16 , and @entity7 , aged 14 , outside his mother 's house with their son @entity19 , aged two months , in 2003 since then he has never spent more than a week on @entity52 , and for the past three years has been getting up at dawn to work as a landscape gardener			1
@entity8 has been a full - time mother since sons @entity20 - now three - and 11 - month - old @entity17 arrived			2
in 2009 , @entity7 , now 22 , proposed and the couple are taking part in a competition with a local radio station to win an all - expenses - paid wedding next month			2
' obviously we 've done things backwards - it would be better to start a relationship , get married , buy a house and have children , ' said @entity7			1
' @entity19 's eight now , it wo n't be long before he 's the age i was when we had him			0
when he is i 'll tell him he needs to wait , get a good education , go to university , and then when he has a family he 'll be able to provide for them better than we 've been able to			0
' the couple put their success down to their supportive families			0
‘ everybody said , “ you ’ll never last with a young child ” , ’ @entity7 added			1
’ and the pair have been determined to get by without hand - outs			0
‘ you should be able to support your own children and not rely on other people , ’ said @entity7			1
‘ i always thought , “ they ’re my children , i should take care of them ”			0
’ the couple have been shortlisted for the wedding prize by @entity96			0
‘ we ’re more inclined to spend money on the kids than save up for the wedding , ’ said @entity8			2
‘ that ’s why winning would be so great			0
’ despite friends and family telling the young couple , pictured in @entity108 in 2007 , their relationship would not last , nine years on - and after two more children - the couple are still together and ready to tie the knot			2

@entity7 and @entity8 have since added two more children to their family
determined to support themselves , they have only ever claimed benefits for one week
