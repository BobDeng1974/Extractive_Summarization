@entity1 manager @entity0 feels his players have ' grown up ' after going top of their @entity5 qualifying group			1
@entity0 's side held talented @entity7 to a goalless draw at the @entity9 on friday night to make it four points from two games as @entity12 and @entity13 won their first games elsewhere in @entity15 @entity1 now welcome @entity16 to @entity9 on monday night and @entity0 says it will have been a productive camp if they win that game and make it seven points from nine			1
@entity1 manager @entity0 reacts from the sidelines at the @entity9 @entity1 forward @entity24 races past @entity7 's @entity25 at @entity9 ' these players have grown up , ' @entity0 said about a team missing influential midfielders @entity28 and @entity30 through injury but who almost grabbed a winner through @entity24 in the final seconds			1
' they 're not scared of it , they 've accepted the compliment of being called the ' golden generation '			2
' that 's a huge compliment , i 've told them they 've got to earn it and they knew the pressure going into the game			2
' there was a big crowd for a reason but they did n't disappoint			2
if we beat @entity16 i think it will have been a productive camp			0
' over 30,000 turned up on the night as fans appeared to fall in love with their team again after several years where apathy has reigned in @entity58 football			0
they saw @entity1 having to hold on for long periods as the @entity7 dominated midfield and goalkeeper @entity61 was forced to produce several outstanding saves to prevent the hosts from falling behind			1
but @entity1 rallied at the end and @entity24 - who was brilliantly denied by @entity66 's @entity7 goalkeeper @entity65 - @entity67 and @entity68 all had late chances to score			1
' @entity24 's chance was @entity71 all over again , when he scored that fantastic late winner , ' @entity0 said , recalling a @entity74 qualifier two years ago			1
@entity1 ' @entity75 ( centre ) and @entity7 and @entity78 's @entity77 ( left ) battle for the ball @entity1 goalkeeper @entity61 dives to make a save from @entity7 and @entity78 's @entity83 ' i thought he would get a chance but i did n't expect it to be from the same place , but it was a great save			1
' we had other chances and it was a good point and a great performance			2
' we had to ride our luck a little bit because they 're a good team			0
' you know against teams like that you have to do that because they have enough quality when they 're on their game to hurt anybody			0
' we had to stand up to the challenge and we matched them			0
@entity61 pulled off some great saves and we had some chances at their end			1
' they kicked us , we kicked them and it was a good old - fashioned international match			2
' we never played our best football but we dug deep			0
in terms of putting it on the line , i felt our players did n't have anything more to give			0
' @entity0 felt @entity7 midfielder @entity25 was fortunate to stay on the field after picking up a first - half booking for felling @entity120			1
moments later @entity25 fouled @entity68 again but he escaped with only a lecture from the @entity123 referee @entity122			1
' we thought he could have been sent off , ' @entity0 said			1
' on another day maybe , because he kicked him again seconds after the first challenge			0
@entity7 's striker @entity126 ( r ) runs with the ball during the @entity129 qualifier @entity1 defender @entity68 ( 2nd left ) went close with a header in the second half ' it was a shame because he 's a fantastic player , when you look at him from afar he 's good but when you see him close he 's even better			1
' @entity7 coach @entity136 said he was not disappointed with a point and insisted everything was all to play for in the group			2
' the game was as i expected			0
it was a difficult game , ' @entity136 said			0
' we came here to get three points and we took some risks			0
' the score is not bad for either team because they are our direct opponents for second place			0
' but i think the best players on the pitch were the two goalkeepers			0

@entity1 drew 0 - 0 with @entity7 in @entity5 qualifying tie
@entity68 frustrated after *wasting* one of his side 's best chances
@entity24 's shot was brilliantly saved by @entity65 at the end
manager @entity0 *pleased* with the *development* of his player
