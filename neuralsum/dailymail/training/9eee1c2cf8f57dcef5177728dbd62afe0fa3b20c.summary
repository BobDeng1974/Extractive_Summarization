by @entity0 for @entity1 with rugged knits made from @entity4 wool and coats made in an artisan textiles factory in @entity7 , the cosy new collection from @entity9 has a distinctly @entity11 feel			1
unveiled here in an exclusive set of photos , the classic coats and wearable dresses are the latest to emerge from the fashionable brain of style director , @entity18 , and reveal a new focus on traditional materials after years of polycotton and pleather			2
drawing on heritage pieces from the @entity9 archive , highlights include a flattering cotton blouse in a chic red and white print , and a pure wool pale grey duffle coat			1
scroll down or video stylish : the new best of @entity11 collection includes coats made in @entity7 and plenty of @entity4 wool highlights : top pieces include this £ 59 crimson dress ( left ) and the traditional herringbone tweed coat , £ 299 others likely to prove popular include a simple navy wool jumper and an on - trend 60s shift dress crafted from scarlet wool			1
the collection , which launches on the 28th august , is the latest weapon unleashed by the high street brand in a bid to boost flagging sales figures			2
despite the success of last autumn 's pink duster coat , which will be reissued this year in a rainbow of hues , @entity9 has struggled to compete with cheap and cheerful brands such as @entity55 and @entity56			0
damp squib collections for @entity9 have n't helped and have allowed @entity58 , which specialises in stylish , middle - of - the - road pieces , to pull ahead			2
even the much vaunted ' @entity61 ' campaign starring @entity62 , @entity63 and @entity64 failed to make much of an impact			0
practical : this £ 159 crepe dress ( left ) and the pretty jacquard version ( £ 189 , right ) are both incredibly versatile cosy : a royal blue wool coat made in @entity7 costs £ 299 while the cotton shirt beneath comes in at £ 89 but the fourth @entity73 collection could transform the fortunes of the brand , thanks to wearable pieces designed to inspire its core audience , while also enthusing new shoppers			1
along with @entity4 wool and @entity84 coats , the 54 - piece range , which starts at £ 59 , also includes chic pale leather brogues made by a family - run firm in @entity87			1
traditional fabrics such as herringbone and jacquard dominate , with the latter turned into wearable cocktail dresses that would do sterling service on chilly autumn nights			0
