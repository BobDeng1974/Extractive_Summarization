a woman who had stars tattooed on her face says she has no choice other than to claim benefits worth £ 14,000 - a - year because no one will employ her			2
@entity6 , 33 , from @entity7 , says the tattoos , which were done when she was 24 , have turned her into a jobless recluse			1
' until they are removed , i wo n’t be able to find a job and will be stuck on benefits , ' says miss @entity6 , who resigned from her last role because she felt ' left out ' by colleagues , and is now hoping someone will step forward and offer to pay for her to have laser removal			1
benefits : @entity6 , 33 , from @entity7 , says she ca n't get a job because of her six facial tattoos ‘ i ca n’t afford to have it done but i ’m absolutely desperate to get rid of them , ' says miss @entity6 , who claims she has applied for 40 jobs in the last year but without success			1
' i hope my nightmare will make anyone think twice about having such visible tattoos especially on your face , neck or hands , ' she says			2
' i am well spoken but as soon as people see me they think i ’m rough and common			0
people take one look at me , see the stars and automatically think i ’m a criminal or on drugs			0
' i ’ve applied for 40 jobs in the last year alone			1
but as soon as i turn up for an interview i can see that person looking at the stars on my face			0
' as soon as they see those stars , and the other tattoos on my neck and hands , their mind is made up			2
they are not going to employ me			0
’ tough : she says she has applied for more than 40 jobs but has had no success because of her 18 tattoos embarrassed : her six facial tattoos have left her embarrassed and as a result , she suffers from depression removal : she says she wants a well - wisher to pay for laser treatment - and will have to stay on benefits until then her handouts , which total £ 14,000 a year , include an employment and support allowance of £ 360 a fortnight and housing benefit of £ 400 - a - month			1
she also gets sick money because she suffers from depression , the result , she says , of tattoo - related comfort eating that has caused her go up three dress sizes from a 12 to an 18			1
another great upset is caused by being unable to find a boyfriend , which miss @entity6 says is also down to the inkings			1
' i only attract bad boys , ' she admits			0
' nice guys do n’t fancy me because of my tattoos			2
’ in an ironic twist , the 33 - year - old , who has 18 tattoos in total , says she got her first one as a means of boosting her confidence , which had been knocked by school bullies			1
' i thought if i had tattoos i would look hard and people would think twice before picking on me , ' she explains			2
old life : miss @entity6 pictured before getting the tattoos and before gaining six stone changing shape : she blames the tattoos for causing her to shoot up from a size 12 ( left ) to a size 18 ( right ) over the next six years she got further tattoos done on her arms and neck , but easily found work as a security guard			1
then , aged 24 , she decided to have six stars tattooed on her face - much to her parents and her employers ' horror			0
it took her eight years to find another job , this time as a dog sitter			1
but after a few months , she resigned when other staff failed to invite her on a night out			0
‘ i started off working as a volunteer and people got to know me , ' explains miss @entity6			1
' but other staff were wary of me because of how i look			0
' i did n’t get invited out with them and i was so upset i had to resign			0
’ since then she has been unable to find another job and has spiralled into depression			2
‘ i ca n’t go out because i feel everyone is staring at me , ’ she says			0
‘ i come from a middle class family			0
my dad is an estimator , my sister is a social worker and my mum works in admin. [ but ] people judge me on my looks and rarely bother to get to know me			0

@entity6 , 33 , says she has been turned down for 40 jobs in the last year
suffers depression brought on by her tattoos , which she had done at 24
the former security worker has gained six stone *due* to ' comfort eating '
resigned from the only job she had in years because she felt left out
miss @entity6 is hoping someone will take pity and *buy* her laser removal
