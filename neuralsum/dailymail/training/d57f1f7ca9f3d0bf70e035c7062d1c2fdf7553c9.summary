@entity0 faces an uncertain future after sir @entity2 promised to take action against the @entity5 defender for refusing to wear a kick it out t - shirt			1
the 33 - year - old is known to be unhappy at a perceived lack of activity from the anti-racism organisation , but his manager had promised that all his players would wear the t - shirts before saturday ’s 4 - 2 win over @entity17 at @entity18			1
‘ it ’s embarrassing for me , ’ said irate @entity2			2
‘ it had the support of the @entity22 , and every player in the country should have adhered to that from the @entity22 ’s request			2
we ’re all wearing the badges and he goes and he lets us down			2
’ the irate manager added : ‘ we ’ll deal with it , do n’t worry			2
' in the red : @entity0 did not wear the @entity32 t - shirt before @entity5 played @entity17 @entity0 's boycott came in the wake of widespread player protests on friday as many reacted to the @entity39 ’s apparently lenient punishment of @entity40 for his abuse of his brother , @entity42 , last year			1
the defender was the sole player in the @entity5 squad not to wear the t - shirt over his tracksuit top as he warmed up alongside @entity46 before their home match with @entity17			1
@entity0 , who is out of contract at the end of this season , may now face disciplinary action			1
he is not the first player to feel @entity2 ’s wrath during his 26 years in charge at @entity18			2
@entity56 famously caught a boot in the face from the angry @entity59 after @entity5 lost at home to @entity61 in the @entity62 and was sold to @entity63 four months later			1
@entity64 was also shown the door after he displeased @entity2 following a training ground row with @entity67			0
irate : @entity2 has said he will ' deal ' with @entity0 's defiance and @entity71 ’s days at @entity18 came to an end in 2005 after the club had to pull an interview with @entity75 , in which he criticised @entity5 ’s younger players following a 4 - 1 thrashing at @entity78			1
@entity0 , now in his 10th year at @entity5 , appeared to have mended his relationship with @entity2 after the manager ’s decision to hand the club captaincy to @entity83 in 2010			1
the 33 - year - old is vitally important to @entity2 at the moment with @entity83 out of the team with an injury until the @entity88 and central defenders @entity90 and @entity91 slowly making their way back to fitness			1
such is his need for @entity0 to remain fit that @entity2 urged the defender to retire from international football in his programme notes on saturday to prolong his career at @entity5			1
the controversial defender is also not the only one to have shunned the @entity32 campaign			0
in an apparent act of solidarity , the entire @entity102 and @entity103 squads also did not wear the t - shirts			1
but in direct contrast to @entity2 's views , @entity102 manager @entity107 said that wearing the t - shirt should be an individual choice for players			1
‘ the issue is n’t a football one , it ’s social , ’ said @entity107			0
‘ you ca n’t tell players , “ you have to do it ”			2
‘ this is the opinion of the players [ not wearing the shirts ]			1
you have to ask them , not me			0
there are things you have to leave to each person			0
’ @entity129 ’s @entity128 defender @entity127 also refused to wear one			2
he has not worn a kick it out t - shirt since 2007 after @entity135 ’s @entity134 escaped punishment at an @entity39 inquiry for allegedly racially abusing @entity139 ’s @entity138 during a game in december 2006			1
@entity127 , an @entity139 player at the time , provided written evidence but the charge against @entity145 midfielder @entity144 was not proven			0
@entity127 was joined in his protest by clubmate @entity147			0
we 're in : @entity149 and @entity46 ( right ) wore the anti-racism t - shirts during the warm - up protest : @entity0 had a regular @entity5 training top on before the @entity17 match seeing red : @entity0 's refusal to wear the t - shirt has angered manager @entity2 the decision of @entity17 ’s @entity159 striker @entity158 to join the protest was supported by his manager @entity161 , who said it was a tribute to @entity164 ’s democracy that players had the right to choose whether they wore the t - shirt			1
‘ people in this country have the right to say yes or no. in a lot of countries you have n’t the right			0
you can do what you want here			0
you have the chance to stand up and say you do n’t want to do it			0
‘ this is a great country			0
it is the best country in the world			0
they might have a gripe			0
‘ i ’ve never — and no club i ’ve managed — have ever worried about anything like that			0
black , white , @entity189 , @entity190 , you treat people as human beings			0
there is good and bad in religion and colour			0
you have to be straight down the middle and treat everyone the same			0
’ not on : @entity129 defender @entity127 ( centre ) had no intention of wearing the t - shirt standing his ground : @entity201 did not wear the yellow t - shirt at @entity203 the disquiet over @entity32 is set to continue , with @entity139 players @entity206 and @entity207 insisting they will refuse to wear the t - shirts at @entity209			1
their stance may be backed by other team - mates			2
@entity206 , a devout @entity213 , said : ‘ personally , i do n’t think i will wear it			2
in fact , i know i wo n’t			0
i do n’t want to be some poster boy for kicking racism out of football because i do n’t even want to talk about situations that have happened			0
‘ are we really kicking racism out ? that ’s the thing			0
i still believe in the same thing			0
kick racism out of everything , not just football			2
kick it out of everything — society			2
we are all fighting the same thing , whether you wear a t - shirt or not			1
’ @entity32 chairman lord @entity233 insisted it was ‘ ridiculous ’ for players not to wear t - shirts			1
‘ it ’s ridiculous to say that by not wearing a t - shirt or by not supporting @entity32 you are actually going to change things , ’ he said			1
@entity242 stance : referee @entity243 and his assistants warm up wearing the anti-racism t - shirts at @entity102			1

@entity5 boss promises to take action against @entity0 after he boycotted the shirt during the team 's match against @entity17
the 33 - year - old is unhappy with the @entity39 's apparently lenient punishment against @entity40 for his abuse of @entity257 's brother , @entity42
@entity102 and @entity103 squads also refused to wear t - shirts
kick it out chairman said the players were ' ridiculous ' for boycotting shirts
