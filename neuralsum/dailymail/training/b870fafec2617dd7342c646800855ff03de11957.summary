@entity1 's zombie action flick has been mired by negative publicity concerning rewrites , re-shoots and an inexperienced creative team that has caused the film 's budget to increase from $ 170million to a reported $ 400million			1
based upon @entity10 's science fiction novel of the same name , the film now has the biggest budget ever recorded			0
and with the film opening in cinemas next month , could @entity13 be the most expensive flop in cinematic history ? scroll down for trailer re-shoots : @entity1 's production company had to pay $ 200 million to re-film the final act because no one liked the ending bad times : @entity1 's @entity13 has reached a $ 400 million budget , making it the most expensive film in cinematic history commentators have cited a number of the reasons for the poor predictions of the film 's box office success			1
help : lost and @entity35 writer @entity34 was brought in to help steer @entity13 in the right direction @entity39 contributor @entity37 blamed poor communication between director @entity41 and 42 - year - old star @entity1 whose production company @entity43 is bankrolling the project			1
she said their differences led to an unclear ending to the story that caused serious delays in filming			0
@entity41 's limited experience of big budget films - previous credits include @entity54 which earned box office success but was considered a critical failure - was also pointed out as a possible reason for the overrunning of the shoot			2
a day of filming was reportedly lost after caterers did n't have enough food to feed 750 extras and ' undocumented bills from a @entity66 shoot ' were found unpaid , also adding to the escalating budget costs			1
scenes for the movie were shot on location in three continents in the cities of @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity66 , @entity75 , and @entity76 which will have increased the budget further			2
the screen rights were secured in 2007 , and @entity80 writer @entity79 's drafted an initial script , reportedly praised by many in the way it redefined the genre			0
but in the six years since then , the film went through a complete rewrite by @entity88 ( @entity89 ) to make it fit into the action genre more readily			0
@entity39 say @entity1 's production company @entity43 then spent an extra $ 200 million to re-shoot the film 's 40 - minute long third act , because ' executives were n't happy with the ending			1
' that 's when lost and @entity35 writer @entity34 was brought into help			0
@entity1 reportedly told @entity98 : ' the thing we really need right now is someone who is not burdened by all the history that this thing is inheriting , who can see what we 've got and tell us how to get to where we need to get			0
' inexperience : a creative team unused to working on blockbuster films also contributed to the problems on set and rising budget speaking to @entity98 admitted : ' i did n't think anyone was going to say , ' let 's throw it out and try something else			1
" ' that is precisely what happened , with the producers both at @entity43 and @entity120 - who bought the option with @entity1 for $ 1 million - agreeing to dump previously shot footage and make way for a complete rewrite of the final act			1
commentators claim the $ 400million film will struggle at the box office because it is not part of a movie franchise			0
drumming up interest : @entity1 speaks to the audience at a special viewing for his film @entity13 held at the @entity136 on wednesday night in @entity75 while @entity137 3 and @entity138 benefited from their global fanbase returning to the cinema , @entity13 is the first adaption of @entity10 's zombie novel			2
the original book is presented as a series of anecdotal histories detailed by various survivors of the zombie apocalypse from across the world			0
the highest grossing zombie movie of all time is @entity151 securing approximately $ 148 millon followed by @entity152 with $ 76 million according to @entity153			1
is it any good ? @entity1 also surprised an audience at a special screening of the flick in @entity158 to check reactions from fans , who filmed him doing so film analyst @entity162 of @entity163 , told @entity164 : i think $ 120 million to $ 150 million here is a very possible [ box office ] goal for @entity13 ' it 's a kind of movie that people really respond to			1
i think people are missing the comparison to @entity174 , another zombie movie that was extremely successful			2
' however , if @entity162 's estimate about @entity13 's box office success proves accurate that would mean a loss of almost $ 250 million			0
@entity13 is released in the @entity180 & @entity181 on june 21st .			0
