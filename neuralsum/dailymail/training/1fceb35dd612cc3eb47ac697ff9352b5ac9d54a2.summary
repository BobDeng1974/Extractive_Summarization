it proved an emotional day for @entity1 , but the @entity2 leave @entity3 feeling sorry for themselves after sinking to a tenth straight defeat			1
thrust in to the action in the second half following a knee injury to starting tackle @entity10 , @entity1 and the @entity2 were routed 38 - 14 by the @entity11			1
' it 's not the result we wanted			1
we had a great week of practice			1
we were really prepared , ' @entity1 said			1
@entity1 points to the crowd during his @entity18 debut which ended in a tough defeat for the @entity2 @entity1 gets to grips with @entity11 ' dangerous pass - rusher @entity22 ' the game of football is like that			1
i think there 's things which we did and that i 'm proud of and a lot of guys on the team are proud of that we kept fighting right to the end			1
' the 6ft 5in @entity37 led the @entity2 out onto the field and with his mother and daughter watching him play for the first time , he admitted the moment was a special one			1
' i think the best part was when the @entity46 anthem came on			2
that was such an emotional moment because usually it 's just the @entity50 anthem			2
i always blow a kiss when i 'm in @entity50 , because i always wish my dad and mum could see me play			2
they were there , so i just let them know that i found them in the crowd and let them know that i can see them and know that they 're there			2
' i try not to be caught in the moment a lot			2
it was a little emotional before the game			1
but as soon as we started and i was coming in the extra tackle package , i did n't notice the crowd , i was out there just trying to complete the assignments			1
' @entity1 makes a tackle as back - up quarterback @entity73 releases the ball @entity1 met @entity76 presenter @entity75 in midweek and the pair were reunited at @entity18 with @entity1 being used sparingly this season , it was a case of next man up as he entered the fray			1
' unfortunately , @entity10 went down and i was in			1
and i got a little second on the sidelines and it felt like , well , this is kind of historic to be at home and a guy goes down and i have to step up			2
' and @entity1 faced a familiar face in the shape of @entity22 - and the @entity11 ' pass rusher kept him on his toes			1
' he 's a great player			2
i met @entity91 when we came out here for the media day			0
we got to chat it up a little bit			0
and i told him out on the field that there was a second where i kind of laughed at him			0
i said , yeah , i know what you 're doing			0
and i said , well , guess what , adjustment			0
i just made some adjustments			0
but he 's a great player , as you all know			0
' i did n't give up a sack			0
just a couple technical things i was a little sloppy at , which he capitalised on			0
he was bending the corner really well and i was n't getting out of my stance			0
i was n't using my length at first			0
every once in a while , i got to use my length			0
and a couple times he got a hold of my shoulder			0
just a couple little things that i was doing , technical wise , that was allowing him to have a little edge			0
