by @entity0 follow @ @ marthakelner @entity1 strolled on to a @entity2 that felt more like the venue for a wake than a rocking sports arena , the crowd still reeling from seeing @entity9 ’s demise			1
it was a more muted reception than the seven - time champion has become accustomed to and he offered little to immediately restore order , dropping the first set to fellow @entity15 @entity14 in 30 minutes			1
but @entity1 was unruffled , smoothing a crease from his shirt and running a hand through his hair before grinding out the second set and powering to a 3 - 6 , 7 - 6 , 6 - 4 , 6 - 4 victory			1
at the net he embraced his good friend and stopped to sign autographs as he left			0
dominant : @entity1 celebrates after beating @entity14 in the quarter - finals at @entity26 on form : @entity1 fist pumps in front of a roaring crowd after taking the third set on @entity2 frustration : @entity14 slammed his racket to the ground after losing the crucial set tough day : after losing the second set , the @entity36 winner receives treatment from the physio down but not out : @entity1 is floored during a rally against his @entity15 compatriot @entity1 looked more like a man who had enjoyed a brisk walk in the park than a 2hr 55min slog on the lawn			1
he now faces his 35th @entity48 semi-final and his ninth at @entity50			0
rather ominously for friday ’s opponent , 23 - year - old @entity51 , he has gone on to reach the final on all but one of those occasions and the only time he has lost on the second sunday at the @entity55 was to @entity56 in a 2008 epic			1
‘ it ’s a comfortable place to be , ’ said @entity1			2
‘ you know there is a chance now to go a step further because you trust your game and you ’ve been there before so many times			0
’ the 32 - year - old has won all four confrontations with big - serving @entity69 , most recently at the @entity36 this year			0
@entity51 is one of an emerging group challenging the @entity71 along with @entity72 , @entity73 and @entity74			1
@entity56 and @entity9 have already fallen to this thrusting talent			0
‘ it ’s exciting to see new faces , ’ said @entity1			2
‘ we still do n’t have enough teenagers			0
it ’s just hard breaking through for a youngster to win or be consistent over five matches in a row and get those ranking points			0
’ classy : he lost the first set , but the king of grass looked his usual self thereafter @entity1 ’s progress has been so imperious that it was not until the fourth game of yesterday ’s match — 6hr 9min into his title challenge — that his serve was broken for the first time			1
@entity14 converted the second and sealed the first set with a supersonic forehand			1
he maintained his level in the second set , taking @entity1 to a tiebreak			1
but even as he ages @entity1 retains a magic touch and a beautiful volley set him up to take the set			1
@entity14 was reduced to a shell of a man thereafter and later admitted to being exhausted after playing for the third consecutive day			2
controversial scheduling meant his third - round match against @entity111 was held over from friday to monday			0
‘ it was tough to play three days in a row , especially when i played the third against @entity1 , ’ said @entity14			1
‘ it cost me a lot of energy but @entity1 deserved to win			2
’ out of reach : @entity14 stretches to return against the number four seed support : @entity121 watches on from the box on @entity2 @entity1 does not only have a youngster to deal with on court tomorrow but four more at home			1
he admitted to struggling to balance looking after his two sets of twins — five - year - old girls @entity129 and @entity131 and two - month - old boys @entity133 and @entity134			0
‘ i need to be on the same wavelength with my wife ( @entity136 ) on how we raise our kids , ’ @entity1 said			2
‘ they sleep much better now ( but ) the daytimes are very busy			0
’ @entity1 ’s only real grumble was directed at the @entity55 , who rigorously enforced their all - white outfit rule			2
‘ it ’s too strict , ’ he said			0
‘ if you look at the pictures of @entity147 , @entity148 ... there was some colours			0
maybe one day they ’ll loosen the grip			0

@entity1 advanced to the 2014 @entity26 semi-final , *bouncing* back from a set down against @entity14 to win in four
@entity1 will play @entity155 @entity51 after he knocked out @entity157 *wonderkid* @entity74
@entity1 *'s* head - to - head record against @entity14 is now at 14 - 2
