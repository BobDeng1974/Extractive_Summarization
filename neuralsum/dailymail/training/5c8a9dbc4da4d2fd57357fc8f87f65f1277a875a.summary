thanks to enormous water pumps from the @entity9 removing millions of tonnes of water from the land , large sections of the @entity2 are now dry , allowing for long - awaited dredging to begin on silt - laden rivers in the area			1
the dredging is part of a £ 5.8million plan to clear a five mile stretch of the nearby tone and @entity22 rivers , with the project due to get underway on monday - just a day before a deadline imposed by @entity25 in the middle of february			1
at last : thanks to enormous water pumps from the @entity9 removing millions of tonnes of water from the land , large sections of the @entity2 are now dry , allowing for long - awaited dredging to begin on silt - laden rivers in the area plans : the dredging project will see tonnes of sediment removed from the rivers tone and @entity22			1
the material has been building up since clearing stopped 18 years ago before : this photograph was taken on the @entity2 in january and shows huge expanses of land under several feet of water and after : the same area seen three months later			2
millions of tonnes of water have been removed by enormous water pumps brought over from the @entity9 the dredging project will see engineers remove tonnes of sediment from the rivers , which has built up since clearing stopped 18 years ago			1
it is hoped removing the sediment will increase the capacity of the rivers , which have been operating at just 60 per cent in places , and reduce the risk of them overflowing during the next period of heavy rainfall			2
the dredging comes as farmers who evacuated the area in january finally started to move their cattle back on to rain - damaged fields			2
the initial dredging is just the start of a £ 100million plan which was put together by locals in the hope of ensuring their homes are never flooded again			0

the dredging comes as farmers who evacuated the area finally start to move their cattle back on to rain - damaged fields underway : the dredging will start at a crucial point of the @entity98 , where two and a half miles will be cleared before workmen move on to the @entity22 speaking ahead of the dredging , @entity101 chief executive @entity100 said : ' when the waters recede and the media spotlight moves on to something else , it 's very easy to get moved on to the next challenge			1
' ' however we will keep chasing for money to prevent prolonged flooding			0
we will not stand by and run the risk of more floods when we have spells of prolonged rain			0
' in february prime minister @entity25 promised that work to clear the river beds would begin by the end of march			2
work will start at a crucial point of the @entity98 , where two and a half miles will be cleared before workmen move on to an equal stretch of the @entity22			0
the full 20 - year dredging plan includes improvements to the upper river areas that drains into the @entity124 , and a water gate across the @entity22 near @entity126 it is hoped removing the sediment will increase the capacity of the rivers , which have been operating at just 60 per cent in places , and reduce the risk of them overflowing during the next period of heavy rainfall this @entity136 levels home become a symbol of the january floods when its owner - builder @entity140 - refused to abandon the property despite it being completely surrounded by water			1
he created makeshift defences from building material he had on site dubbed @entity150 's castle , the property managed to escape the extensive flooding thanks to a seven - foot high mud dam			0
this is how the four - bedroom home in @entity155 , @entity136 looks today in february @entity25 promised that work to clear the river beds would begin by the end of march			2
it will finally get underway on monday - just one day before the prime minister 's deadline the full 20 - year plan includes improvements to the upper river areas that drains into the @entity124 , and a water gate across the @entity22 near @entity126 to prevent tidal surges			1
the work begins as farmers start to rebuild their livelihoods which were decimated by the waters			0
farmer @entity171 , 40 , this week returned some of his 550 cows to his farm in @entity175 , @entity126			0
they had been scattered all over @entity136 after all 790 acres of his farm went underwater and he lost 10,800 bales of hay and straw , and countless farm machines			0
he said : ' it will be a relief to get them back , it will make life so much easier			0
i can get some feed in and i wo n't have to take it back and forth			0

the rivers @entity189 and @entity22 can now be cleared of sediment , which has *dramatically* reduced their capacity
both rivers had been operating at 60 per cent - causing regular flooding in and around the @entity2
the dredging is scheduled to begin on monday - just one day before a @entity25 - imposed deadline
project is finally underway after @entity9 pumps removed millions of tonnes of water and mud from the land
