the two - bedroom end of terrace house was reduced to rubble after it collapsed on tuesday morning builders had been stripping the interior of the house as part of the project shortly before the collapse according to a planning application with the @entity30 of @entity31 , permission had been granted to demolish an existing garage at the end - of - terrace site			1

' but unlike the war i did n't go climbing over the rubble like i would 've done when i was a kid			0
' somehow i managed to sleep right through it too but it must 've been a terrible noise			0
' residents were evacuated and a 50 metre exclusion zone was put in place when the collapse fractured a gas supply			0

' fortunately , it was unoccupied at the time it collapsed and no - one was injured			0
