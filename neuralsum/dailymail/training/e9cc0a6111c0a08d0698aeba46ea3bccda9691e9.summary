by @entity0 last updated at 2:34 am on 12th february 2012 to generations of @entity5 people , the name @entity2 has been synonymous with controversial and scandalous money matters thanks to the notorious financial affairs of family patriarch and former taoiseach @entity2			1
but today , the @entity10 can reveal a new chapter in the family saga as we disclose that a multimillion - euro loan related to the helicopter business of his son , @entity16 , has been taken over by @entity18			1
the ex-taoiseach may have been able to have his own bank debts quietly swept under the carpet for much of his indulged and corrupt life but the company set up by his son – which was used to funnel € 600,000 to his father – has now landed the family name in the ‘ toxic bank ’			1
lift - off : @entity29 in one of his helicopters the loan in question is related to @entity34 , a firm jointly owned by @entity29 and @entity35 , a @entity36 helicopter pilot			1
now though , in an unfortunate twist of fate , his business dealings with mr @entity2 have crashed to earth			1
@entity34 has close connections to @entity42 , which was set up by mr @entity2 in 1985 and has featured extensively in various tribunal inquiries into payments to his father			1
mr @entity2 and mr @entity35 are fellow directors of both firms and @entity42 is part - owned by @entity34			2
other shareholders in @entity48 include @entity49 – the @entity2 family firm that controls assets such as the island of @entity52 off the @entity54 coast as well as seaside properties in @entity56			1
the @entity57 has discovered that ­ @entity34 ’s @entity18 loan is a € 3m @entity60 advance secured against the land and aircraft hangers at the @entity42 headquarters in @entity64 near @entity65			1
only the largest of the 850 property developers whose loans have been taken over by @entity18 are directly managed by the agency itself			2
the @entity64 heliport is the only property registered to @entity34 and land registry documents reveal several back - to - back @entity60 loans secured against the asset			2
the first @entity5 @entity60 loan is dated february 1996 , when @entity79 bought the land from @entity42 with the intention of renting the hangers and facilities out			2
but the initial loan is followed by seven further advances from @entity60 , which increased in frequency between 2000 and 2008			2
in all , company documents reveal that @entity79 has seven outstanding mortgages with @entity60 , many of them for helicopters			2
wedding : @entity29 married @entity91 20 years ago , to the delight of his father @entity93 , right the latest accounts for @entity34 , filed to the @entity97 just this week , reveal that the company had a bank loan of € 3.1m in 2011 , the balance of which had increased by more than € 100,000 from the previous year rather than being reduced by repayments			1
meanwhile , the accounts value the company ’s property asset at less than € 2m			1
when approached by the @entity57 at his @entity104 home this week , mr @entity35 admitted that the debt had been taken over by @entity18			2
mr @entity35 said : ‘ that ’s because the whole bank was taken in			1
either you had a loan or you did n’t			2
if you were in @entity60 , regardless of if you were making repayments or not , @entity18 had it			2
’ however , when he was asked if the company had defaulted or missed payments on the loan , meaning it could face enforcement by @entity18 , he admitted that it had			1
asked whether @entity79 was still in default and would be able to pay the loan back , mr @entity35 said it depended on how things went			0
when asked how things were going for @entity34 , he replied : ‘ same as ­ everything else in the country at the moment			1
’ he has gone from being a swashbuckling @entity125 army helicopter pilot to the late @entity2 ’s trusted helper – the pilot who discreetly flew @entity2 ’s lover , @entity129 , pictured above right , to romantic rendezvous on his @entity133 island of @entity52			1
then , as a business partner of the former taoiseach ’s son , @entity16 , @entity134 found himself being questioned by two tribunals before winding up in @entity18			1
now 67 and living in a modest home in @entity104 , he is thought to have been born to @entity5 parents in @entity141 before qualifying as a helicopter pilot and serving his time in @entity144			0
according to the @entity145 he served with the @entity146 – a unit that distinguished itself with several valour and merit awards as it served throughout the war			0
in @entity5 , @entity150 is still renowned as a daring flyer who gave many a pilot their first start as @entity42 provided work for new graduates			0
some still recall his habit of doubling forward to light his cigarettes with the same hand that controlled the chopper so as not to have his hands leave the controls			1
as the founding pilot of @entity42 , he flew with many famous names , including @entity165			0
the situation at @entity42 appears no better			0
the company has failed to file accounts for more than a year and mr @entity2 and @entity150 have received enforcement warnings from the @entity97			0
a spokesman for the @entity97 said : ‘ they have had notices from our enforcement section and they are following up on that at the moment			1
they are open to prosecution and strike - off if they do n’t file			0
’ @entity42 did attempt to file an annual return on january 26 but that was sent back as it was deemed to be not in order			1
the @entity57 made several attempts to speak to mr @entity2 about the @entity18 loan and other matters at his palatial home in @entity187 , @entity188 , and his place of work , as well as through emails and phone messages to colleagues at @entity42			0
he did not respond to any of these approaches			0
mr @entity2 ’s journey into @entity18 is merely the latest twist in a ­ frequently controversial business career dominated and over- ­ shadowed from the very beginning by his late father			1
during the recession of the @entity203 , it was joked that the best way to get a job was to be the taoiseach ’s son			2
in 1985 when , at the age of 25 , @entity29 wanted to establish @entity48 , it was his father ’s bagman , @entity211 , who stepped up to the mark to help him out			1
the result was that the first two loans the company received came from @entity217 and @entity218 , which would ­ feature endlessly as the @entity220 and @entity219 investigated payments to @entity2			0
the initial capital for @entity42 was a combination of £ 80,000 collected by @entity211 , who ran the @entity217 private bank , and a loan from @entity217 & @entity226 itself			2
some £ 50,000 of this was found to have been transferred through the now ­ notorious @entity229 ­ bacher account			0
when the company found itself in dire financial straits in the early nineties , a further £ 290,000 was raised by mr @entity211			2
this money was contributed by a number of businessmen , including @entity238 , a @entity239 supporter who two years ago was awarded the lucrative contract to roll out speed detector vans across the country			0
the tribunals would also uncover other instances of businessmen going out of their way to help in order to keep on good terms with @entity2			0
for example , @entity249 , of @entity250 , organised a loan to help @entity42 pay for the insurance he was providing – then proceeded to pay off the loan himself			0
the @entity256 found that mr @entity249 ’s actions had been motivated by his ‘ desire not to fall foul of what was perceived to be mr @entity2 ’s enormous power ’			1
it added : ‘ the payment was on the face of it the straightforward discharge of a debt owed by a company , @entity42 , associated with mr @entity2			2
‘ mr @entity249 emphasised that he did not want to have made an enemy of the son of the most powerful man in the @entity272 ; that the risk to which his own business might be exposed in the event of mr @entity2 ’s son ’s business failing			1
’ in all , @entity2 was found to have received indirect payments of more then £ 600,000 through his son ’s helicopter company			1
the tribunal also found that @entity2 ‘ had used @entity48 as a vehicle for the transmission of other funds , in themselves unrelated to @entity285 , so as to enable them to be applied to his own use , while removing traces of the identity of the providers of the funds ’			1
there would be other skirmishes between @entity29 and the tribunals			1
holiday : @entity295 and @entity129 were flown by @entity35 in 2006 , the @entity226 criticised him and mr @entity134 for failing to tell the inquiry that a significant amount of the proceeds from the sale of a share in a land holding near @entity65 had been transferred to the @entity302			0
a lot of money had been spent ‘ wandering around the globe trying to work out where the money had gone ’ , complained tribunal chairman @entity305 when @entity306 and @entity150 retracted evidence			1
the pair had originally told the tribunal that the proceeds for the sale of the lands owned by a consortium called @entity316 , which the tribunal was investigating , had gone to @entity165			0
but they later changed their evidence and conceded that @entity79 had received , via an @entity302 account , most of the proceeds			0
that same year , @entity42 made a settlement of almost € 700,000 with the @entity322			0
the payment was made after it emerged the company had under declared its vat when it was audited by the revenue			0
@entity48 was found to owe tax of € 333,989 and had to pay interest and penalties of € 355,956			0
the total settlement was € 689,945			0
but despite mounting debts at his companies and the pressure of paying off tax settlements , mr @entity2 showed no outward signs of financial stress in recent years			0
in 2007 , he applied for planning permission to @entity338 to renovate and extend his home extensively , adding a new recreation room , conservatory and three - car garage			0
that same year , on september 13 , he bought a @entity344 apartment in @entity345			0
documents obtained by the @entity57 reveal mr @entity2 used a $ 765,000 ( € 580,000 ) @entity348 loan to buy the $ 969,000 property			0
the one - bedroom apartment in the @entity352 building is now worth $ 765,000 .			0

in his early days , @entity29 ’s business woes were eclipsed by his father ’s scandals . now he is on the radar of our ‘ toxic bank ’ *...* all thanks to his controversial chopper firm
