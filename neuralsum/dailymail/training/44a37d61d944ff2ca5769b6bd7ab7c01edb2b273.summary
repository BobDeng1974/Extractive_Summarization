the trip came just six weeks after a star - studded event at @entity9 's house in @entity10 which raised $ 4.5million for the president 's re-election campaign			1
it is unclear how the trip , which saw mr @entity1 fly to @entity2 on @entity15 and official helicopter @entity16 , is being paid for			1
the president 's jaunt has been attacked by the state @entity20 , who described mr @entity1 as the ' campaigner - in - chief ' and urged him to focus on ' job creation and economic growth ' rather than november 's election			1
@entity27 to meet you ! @entity1 shakes hands with 10 - year - old @entity30 at @entity32 airport the eagle has landed : mr @entity1 disembarking at @entity32 on his way to the $ 40,000 - a - head dinner @entity15 touched down at @entity32 shortly before 5pm on monday , and mr @entity1 shook the hands of young @entity2 who had gathered on the runway to watch him arrive			1
he was then whisked to @entity10 on @entity16 , before travelling by motorcade to the exclusive @entity40 in the city 's @entity41			0
there he addressed an audience of 60 wealthy donors around 8pm , in an event believed to have raised $ 2.4million for his election battle with @entity20 @entity48			1

in the air : mr @entity1 flies over the @entity51 in his official helicopter , @entity16 touching down : @entity16 lands at the @entity54 helipad on monday afternoon during the dinner , the president told donors he thought he was likely to win the election , but stressed the need to keep up with mr @entity48 's campaign spending			2
' if the election were held today , i think it 'd be close , but i think we 'd win , ' mr @entity1 said			0
he described his administration 's efforts to boost the struggling economy but admitted : ' right now , the economy is still rough enough for enough people that this is going to be a close election			0
' mr @entity1 added that big - spending super pacs ' are engaging in an experiment that we have not seen in @entity76 democracy for quite some time			2
they are spending like nobody 's business and focusing on negative ads. ' he said the @entity80 do not have to match that spending dollar - for - dollar , ' but we do have to make sure that we can get our message out effectively			0
' heading off : the president boards @entity15 at @entity86 on his way to @entity10 leaving home : mr @entity1 outside the @entity90 before his fundraising trip to @entity2 on monday the president is required for security reasons to travel on official aircraft with a large @entity95 following			1
when he is campaigning , the @entity80 usually reimburses the cost of the travel to the taxpayer			0
however , in the past mr @entity1 has frequently combined fundraising trips with his official duties , meaning that the government shares the cost with his campaign			0
