from public urination to streaking and night - time fistfights , @entity0 has seen it all while living in a house sandwiched between two @entity7 fraternities			1
@entity0 , 61 , a @entity8 veteran and retired @entity10 firefighter , purchased more than $ 60,000 worth of surveillance equipment in hopes of warding off his neighbors ’ bad behavior , but to no avail			1
‘ i have video of them throwing 1.75 - liter glass bottles of vodka off their tower , at the front door of our house , ’ he said			0
@entity0 moved from @entity10 to @entity30 in 1988 and settled in his wife 's old family home on @entity37 that once belonged to her grandmother			1
at first , the couple and their young neighbors got along fine			0
' we were invited to the fraternities for their monday night lobster and steak dinners , and i did many things for the fraternities , ' the retired firefighter told @entity61 's 20/20 in an episode that airs tonight at 10pm			1
but with the advent of cell phones and social media , things quickly spiraled out of control in the neighborhood jam - packed with fraternities and sororities , which were now drawing hundreds of people to their parties every weekend			1
anyone familiar with the plot of the 2014 comedy neighbors starring @entity76 and @entity77 can guess what happened when , much like @entity76 's character in the movie , mr @entity0 started complaining about the loud noise and inappropriate conduct of rowdy college kids			2
in the flesh : surveillance cameras installed by @entity0 on his property captured two young men running naked down the street from one of the frat houses nearby bottoms up : another recording shows a young woman coming out of a frat house without underwear			1
the image on the right shows her bending down to pick up her keys fisticuffs : besides their naked antics , frat boys sometimes come to blows outside @entity0 ' home caught with his pants down : the homeowner has complained about his neighbors ' lewd behavior , but to no avail alcohol - fueled antics : this video shows what appears to be a vodka bottle flying through the air before landing on @entity0 ' property in a case of life imitating art , the fraternities declared war of @entity0 and his family			1
according to the 61 - year - old homeowner , students would break into his house , throw up and defecate on the edge of his property and even leave death threats on his voicemail			0
even local police could do nothing to stop the fraternities from throwing wild parties lasting into the wee hours of the morning			2
' we ’re under siege and we ’re not getting really any help from the university or the authorities , ’ @entity0 said			0
@entity0 has been documenting his neighbors ' antics with surveillance cameras installed all over his property			2
his extensive collection includes videos of young men and women running naked down the street and relieving themselves in public , groups of drunken college kids brawling outside his house and liquor bottles flying over the fence			1
life imitating art : @entity0 ' tale reads like the screenplay of the 2014 comedy neighbors starring @entity76 , @entity152 and @entity77 ( pictured ) at war : like in the movie , things took a bad turn for @entity0 after he started complaining about the frat boys ' behavior in an interview with @entity160 last year , @entity0 said the makers of neighbors went on a site called @entity164 , where he has been posting his surveillance videos , to get ideas for some of the debauchery scenes in the raunchy flick			2
@entity0 ’ attorney @entity170 told @entity61 that the @entity171 receives on average 400 calls a year about frat houses , but no one is ever arrested			2
the law enforcement agency released a statement to the news station saying that it takes ' all crimes seriously ' and ' tries to address community concerns regarding noise complaints , loud parties and alcohol issues			0
' officials with @entity7 said they work with @entity184 organizations affiliated with the university on ' safety , wellness and risk management			0
' if a fraternity is found to be in violation of university policies , it can be stripped of its affiliation to @entity7			0
@entity0 , however , insists that police and @entity7 are not doing enough to address the problem , which is why in 2010 he filed a lawsuit naming dozens of defendants , among them 34 fraternities			1
the retiree 's original suit was dismisses in 2014 but he appealed the decision and refiled the suit			0
@entity0 and his wife , @entity205 , moved out of the house on @entity45 in 2010 , but the former firefighter who is currently battling cancer hopes that one day his spouse will be able to return to her family home in the 2700 block of @entity37			1
‘ i ’m strong enough to continue this , and to keep it going until we have a resolution , ’ he said			0
‘ my friends say that it ’s probably because of this that i ’m still alive			0

@entity0 , 61 , a retired firefighter from @entity10 , filed a lawsuit naming 34 @entity30 fraternities
moved to his wife 's family home on @entity37 in @entity30 in 1988
says things took a turn for the worse with the advent of cell phones and social media that brought hundreds of people to frat parties
