by @entity0 published : 11:41 est , 14 may 2012 updated : 13:36 est , 14 may 2012 the star - studded @entity1 is at the centre of a bitter sexism row because all entries for this year ’s prestigious @entity5 are men			1
no less than 22 male directors will compete for the prize in the @entity10 resort this week			0
this is despite women stars including @entity13 - who will attend this year ’s festival with @entity15 - and @entity16 getting behind the camera to shoot films			1
ignored : female directors such as @entity13 , left , and @entity16 , right , have not been shortlisted for the @entity5 it has led to a group of leading women directors writing an open letter to the @entity1 organisers attacking the way ‘ exclusively male films ’ are being judged , and that ‘ men love depth in women , but only in their cleavage ’			1
the letter published in @entity32 also reads : ‘ in @entity1 , the women show off their show - reels , the men their films ’ , and that actresses are solely celebrated for their ‘ beauty , grace or lightness ’			1
referring to the famous @entity41 in @entity1 , it says that the general message was : ‘ above all , do not let young girls think that one day they might have the nerve to make films and climb the steps of the @entity47 other than on the arm of a prince charming			0
’ the protestors point to the fact that an image of the @entity54 sex symbol @entity55 – who died 50 years ago – was being used on the official festival poster this year , and that talented women are mainly acting as comperes			1
glamorous : @entity59 , left , will be hosting the opening and closing ceremonies for the festival			0
the main role of other female stars such as @entity65 , right , will be to look beautiful @entity59 , the 35 - year - old @entity10 - @entity66 actress who shot to fame in the artist last year , will be hosting the opening and closing ceremonies , for example			2
although stars like @entity13 , @entity75 , @entity76 and @entity65 are expected on the @entity1 red carpet this week , their main role will be to look beautiful			1
among those signing the letter on behalf of a feminist collective called @entity81 are the celebrated @entity10 women directors such as @entity83 , who received three @entity84 in 1985			0
since the @entity1 festival started in 1946 the @entity5 ( or @entity85 ) has gone to only one woman - new - @entity88 @entity87 for @entity89 in 1993			2
past male winners , meanwhile , include @entity91 , @entity92 , @entity93 and @entity94			0
but @entity95 , who is charge of the committee which selects the @entity1 films , said he would never choose a film ‘ that does n’t deserve it just because it ’s directed by a woman ’			2
mr @entity95 said the lack of female directing talent reflected an industry - wide problem , and that ‘ there is no doubt that women ’s role needs to be improved			0

all entries for this year ’s prestigious @entity5 are men
this is despite women stars including @entity13 and @entity16 getting behind the camera to shoot films
