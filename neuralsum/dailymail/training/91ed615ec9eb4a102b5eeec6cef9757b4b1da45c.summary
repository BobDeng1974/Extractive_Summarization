by @entity0 parents often struggled to persuade their children to eat healthy vegetables , but now scientists have found a simple solution - give them superhero names			1
a study revealed that giving greens catchy labels such as ' @entity10 ' led primary school children eat twice as much of the vegetable			2
carrots : may not give you x-ray vision but are an excellent source of carotene , which we turn into @entity19 researchers from @entity21 in the @entity22 asked 147 students ranged from eight to 11 - years - old to taste a new lunch menu over three days , which included carrots			1
they found the different names did not change the amount of carrots the students put on their plates			2
however , children ate 66 per cent of the orange veg when they were named ' x-ray vision carrots , ' while 32 per cent consumed when labeled ' @entity35 ' and 35 per cent when they were n't named			1
in another part of the study , the researchers renamed broccoli as ' @entity40 ' and beans as " @entity42 " in one school 's lunchroom			0
a neighboring school acted as a control with the names of these foods left unchanged			0
the researchers found that , compared to the control school , sales of these vegetables were up by 99 per cent while buying in the control school declined by 16 per cent			1
study lead author , professor @entity53 , said : ' this research suggests that schools have a low - cost or even no - cost solution to induce children to consume more nutritious foods			1
' these results demonstrate that using attractive names for healthy foods increases kid 's selection and consumption of these foods and that an attractive name intervention is robust , effective and scalable at little or no cost			0
' this research also confirms that using attractive names to make foods sound more appealing works on individuals across all age levels			0
' the research team had previously found that associating healthy foods with superheroes like @entity77 would encourage more children to eat these foods			0
the latest study will be published in the journal of @entity82 .			0

children ate 66 **%** of their veg when labelled ' x-ray vision carrots ' compared to 32 **%** just labelled ' @entity35 '
researchers say *re-labeling* food could *provide* low - cost solution to boosting veg intake
