@entity0 may have grumbled about his mercedes in practice for sunday 's @entity3 , but he still managed to again outpace his rivals			1
' something 's not right with this car , ' moaned @entity0 late in the second 90 - minute session at a chilly @entity8 where temperatures only managed to reach 16 degrees centigrade			2
regardless , @entity0 , winner of the last two races in @entity12 and @entity13 , topped the timesheet for the third time in the four friday outings this season , finishing with a lap of one minute 38.315secs			1
on track : @entity0 was fastest in the second practice session for the @entity3 life in the fast lane : @entity0 carried over his good form from @entity12 and @entity13 to the @entity3 head boy : @entity0 , trails @entity26 by 11 points in the championship , but was fastest on friday remarkably , it was not @entity1 team - mate @entity26 who was out in front with the @entity31 on this occasion as @entity34 's @entity33 managed to split the duo			1
with @entity36 in town on the first day of his new job as team principal of @entity34 , @entity33 chose the perfect opportunity to prove the @entity41 is alive and kicking this season			1
just 12 days ago @entity33 crossed the finishing line at the end of the race in @entity13 sarcastically punching the air in delight following a ninth - place finish , with team - mate @entity49 10th			1
that came on the day president @entity51 visited the paddock for the first time this season , and he was naturally left far from impressed			0
welcome along : @entity34 's new team principal , @entity36 arrives at the @entity56 on friday on track : @entity33 was fastest in the morning before finishing behind only @entity0 later on friday eight days later , and @entity58 announced his resignation as team principal , ending just over six seasons in charge , during which time @entity34 collected only one trophy			1
in @entity58 's place , @entity51 has seemingly made an unusual appointment in @entity36 as the 43 - year - old has no experience of @entity68 , although is understood to be a skilled manager given his previous role as president and ceo of @entity73			2
with @entity36 in the paddock , wearing sunglasses throughout despite the leaden skies over the track , @entity33 was quickest in @entity78 and only 0.141secs behind @entity0 in @entity79			1
championship leader @entity26 , 11 points clear of @entity81 , was four tenths of a second adrift , followed closely by @entity84 in his @entity85			0
raring to go : @entity84 was fourth quickest during the second practice session in @entity8 short of pace : @entity88 the @entity91 , eager to put behind him the team 's failed appeal this week against his disqualification from the season - opening race in @entity91 , was 0.496secs down			1
notably , @entity84 was again ahead of reigning four - time champion team - mate @entity88 who was exactly seven tenths of a second down			0
@entity99 ' @entity98 and @entity49 in his @entity34 were sixth and seventh quickest , both inside a second of @entity0			2
the @entity102 , who had been consigned to the garage for all but one installation lap in @entity78 due to a technical problem , at least managed 25 laps in @entity79			0
@entity108 's @entity107 , the @entity109 of @entity110 and @entity111 of @entity112 completed the top 10 , all just over a second down on @entity81			0
there was embarrassment for the second @entity109 driven by @entity116 , however , as he crashed on the entry lane into the pits			0
it is an area that has occasionally caught out some in the past , most notably in 2007 when @entity0 slid off and beached his car in the gravel when he had that year 's world title in his grasp			2
@entity124 @entity116 was simply returning to the pits , but with too much speed as he ran across the gravel and into the tyre wall			0
@entity130 's @entity129 , who has so far finished all 22 of the grands prix in which he has competed , was down in 20th , with both @entity133 behind him .			0

@entity0 , winner in @entity12 and @entity13 , was quickest in friday 's second practice session for the @entity3
@entity33 , who was fastest in the opening session , split the two @entity1 later on friday , with @entity26 third quickest
@entity33 impressed in front of new @entity34 team principal @entity36
