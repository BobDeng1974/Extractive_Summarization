’ she added : ‘ we are so grateful to be alive , but we have lost everything			0
the yacht was our home and now it is gone			2
’ the trip was supposed to have been the start of a new life for the @entity38 , who were planning to sail around the world with their @entity41 terrier @entity23			0
the pair , married for seven years , said they had no fears about crossing the @entity3 when they set out on april 12 along with crew hand @entity46			1
but their dream trip almost came to a terrifying end when their 50ft yacht the @entity53 sank about 900 miles from @entity26			1
@entity8 and @entity9 's dream trip almost came to a terrifying end when their 50ft yacht the @entity53 sank about 900 miles from @entity26 the three ship wrecked passengers @entity21 and @entity22 and @entity46 were eventually rescued when @entity60 coast guards picked up their distress call			1
the @entity63 - registered tanker @entity64 , pictured , carrying a cargo of propane gas to @entity67 , reached them two hours later			1
the pair , from @entity69 , @entity70 , were nine days into a 3,000 - mile journey between the @entity72 and @entity73 and the south of @entity75 when conditions turned treacherous			2
after the seven - year - old boat was battered for two days by 30ft waves , the trio and the dog were forced to leap into a life - raft			0
‘ i knew we were in trouble when i saw @entity23 ’s dog bed go floating by , ’ said mrs @entity27 , who taught children for 27 years			0
‘ he looked at it as well and you could see he knew something was up , ’ as the water flooded in , she grabbed food , water and survival gear , leaving jewellery and other mementoes behind			0
‘ that was our life , our home and here it was going down			0
everything we owned was on the boat and we were losing it , ’ she said			0
@entity22 says an emotional goodbye to the crew on board the @entity64 , the vessel that came to their rescue after their ship sank in the @entity3 with the boat almost submerged , mrs @entity27 – who is just 5ft 2in tall – mistimed her jump as she leapt into the wildly tossing life - raft			1
she ended up partially in the water before she was hauled out by 29 - year - old @entity111 mr @entity46			0
they then activated a radio beacon to pinpoint their position , as the craft was tossed around on the raging sea			0
‘ it was like being in a washing machine ’ , said mr @entity9			2
eventually @entity60 coast guards picked up their distress call and the @entity63 - registered tanker @entity64 , carrying a cargo of propane gas to @entity67 , reached them two hours later			1
the 351ft ship was pitching so violently that its captain @entity125 feared the group would be sucked underwater before they leapt on to steps dangling down from the deck			0
after disembarking from the @entity64 , an emotional @entity21 and @entity22 head for dry land in @entity26 mr @entity9 said they were insistent that three - year - old @entity23 was also rescued			1
‘ if he had gone in the water i would have gone in after him , ’ said the @entity133 - born former detective			0
the group were dropped off in @entity26 on monday , where mrs @entity27 said an emotional farewell to the 13 @entity139 crew , wearing the blue boiler suit that each had signed under the words , ‘ it was an event we will never forget ’			2
she is now hoping to be reunited in the @entity63 with her daughters @entity144 , 21 , and @entity145 , 19			2
but the couple must now face the fact that they have no full cover			2
as they had only owned the boat for seven months , maritime insurers would only offer a third party premium – which does not cover a sinking .			0
