@entity2 and @entity11 died within a year of each other after years living as near recluses in their parents ' modest @entity4 home , giving their neighbors no clue of $ 10 million fortune they had built up through savvy investments			1
it was only once the pair passed that their startling wealth became clear , when @entity2 left hefty donations to a local elementary school , college and nursing home			1
@entity2 was a quiet , unassuming woman who never made headlines during her 87 years , according to the @entity29			1
she taught first grade at @entity31 for 35 years before retiring in 1984 but never married or had children of her own			1
she lived in a comfortable but plain home on a busy highway in @entity4 that sold for just $ 250,000 because it had n't been renovated for decades			1
her twin brother , @entity35 , moved into the family home in their later years			2
the former prudential insurance agent also never married but was largely the source of his sister 's wealth through the stocks and bonds he oversaw on her behalf			0
he died in 2010 with his own sizable estate			2
when they passed away , the multi-millionaire twins ' obituaries mentioned basic details including how they were born in @entity49 but gave no inkling as to their wealth - a combined $ 10 million , lawyers have only just determined			1
the stocks @entity11 controlled exploded in value from the 1960s and 1970s to reach dizzying values , but the pair continued to live their quiet existence			1
' she never really looked at ( her portfolio ) because she never had a demand for that kind of money , ' attorney @entity59 , whose law firm handled her estate , told the @entity29			0
' it shows the whole buy - and - hold ( strategy ) instead of these day traders we 've seen in the last 10 years			2
... she lived a fairly frugal lifestyle			0

and the charities are just learning of her generous post-humus donations			0
not much of a philanthropist while alive , the elderly woman left a total of $ 5 million to her 15 favorite causes in her will			2
she donated nearly $ 480,000 to her beloved @entity4 public schools , more than $ 500,000 to the @entity94 in @entity95 , another $ 400,000 to the @entity97 nursing home where she died , and nearly $ 375,000 to her local parish , @entity99 , the @entity29 reported			1
the school said the donation from the retired teacher - the biggest they 've ever received from anyone - came out of the blue and they are considering using the money to improve the track and field facilities			2
' when we got wind of it , it was quite a surprise , ' @entity108 , the board 's chairwoman , told the @entity29			0
' it 's a great way to honor the legacy of a very special teacher			0
she believed in the school system			0

the nursing home where she died was similarly touched , and surprised			1
' all of us remember her very much as the schoolteacher who always had a twinkle in her eye , ' @entity139 , the fundraising director at @entity97 nursing home told the @entity29			1

' she was low - key , sweet , compassionate			0
' @entity2 graduated from the @entity95 school in 1947 with a degree in nursing but after a short time working in the pediatric unit at @entity172 in @entity95 she chose to switch careers			1
she eventually received a master 's degree in education in 1953 from what is now the @entity178 and she embarked on her long career in the @entity4 public school system			2
she lived a frugal life with few expenses , given she had no children or grandchildren and lived in the unmortgaged home she inherited from her parents			2
meanwhile , her wealth expanded steadily			0
according to the @entity29 , her biggest win on the stockmarket was with stocks in an obscure @entity192 - based motor manufacturing company called @entity193 the decision to invest in the business was @entity11 's , and he 'd done his research			2
for years , the twins flew under the radar in the community they 'd called home for most of their lives			1
