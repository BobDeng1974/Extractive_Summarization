it is a far cry from the bulky , balloon - like spacesuits worn by today 's astronauts			0
in the future , we may simply don a suit that automatically shrinks itself to become a ' second skin ' to protect us from space			1
the skintight , pressurized suit would not only support the astronaut , but would give her much more freedom to move during planetary exploration			1
for future astronauts , the process of suiting up is set to be much simpler			0
instead of climbing into a conventional , bulky , gas - pressurized suit , an astronaut may don a lightweight , stretchy garment , lined with tiny , muscle - like coils ( below )			1
they would then plug in to a spacecraft 's power supply , triggering the coils to contract and essentially shrink - wrap the garment around the body			0

to take the suit off , astronauts would only have to apply modest force , returning the suit to its looser form			1
now @entity18 researchers are one step closer to engineering such an active , ' second - skin ' spacesuit			1
@entity59 , a professor of aeronautics and astronautics and engineering systems at @entity18 , and her colleagues have engineered active compression garments that incorporate small , springlike coils that contract in response to heat			1
the coils are made from a shape - memory alloy ( @entity72 ) — a type of material that ' remembers ' an engineered shape and , when bent or deformed , can spring back to this shape when heated			2
the smart suit in action : an original active tourniquet design , combining shape memory alloy ( @entity72 ) actuators with @entity82 printed structures ( the cream - colored plastic ) and passive fabric ( the white strip )			1
the team incorporated the coils in a tourniquet - like cuff , and applied a current to generate heat			0
at a certain trigger temperature , the coils contract to their ' remembered ' form , such as a fully coiled spring , tightening the cuff in the process			0
in subsequent tests , the group found that the pressure produced by the coils equaled that required to fully support an astronaut in space			1
' with conventional spacesuits , you 're essentially in a balloon of gas that 's providing you with the necessary one - third of an atmosphere [ of pressure , ] to keep you alive in the vacuum of space , ' says @entity111 , who has worked for the past decade to design a form - fitting , flexible spacesuit of the future			0
' we want to achieve that same pressurization , but through mechanical counterpressure — applying the pressure directly to the skin , thus avoiding the gas pressure altogether			2
' we combine passive elastics with active materials			0
… ultimately , the big advantage is mobility , and a very lightweight suit for planetary exploration			1
' the shape changing material : two shape memory alloy ( @entity72 ) coil actuators , shown in their stretched and contracted states			1
current spacesuits are extremely bulky and difficult to put on and move in the coil design was conceived by @entity133 , a postdoc in @entity111 's lab. the researchers rigged an array of coils to an elastic cuff , attaching each coil to a small thread linked to the cuff			2
they then attached leads to the coils ' opposite ends and applied a voltage , generating heat			0
between 60 and 160 c , the coils contracted , pulling the attached threads , and tightening the cuff			0
' these are basically self - closing buckles , ' @entity133 says			0
' once you put the suit on , you can run a current through all these little features , and the suit will shrink - wrap you , and pull closed			2
' the group 's designs and active materials may be used for other purposes , such as in athletic wear or military uniforms			0
' you could use this as a tourniquet system if someone is bleeding out on the battlefield , ' @entity133 says			0
' if your suit happens to have sensors , it could tourniquet you in the event of injury without you even having to think about it			2
' ' an integrated suit is exciting to think about to enhance human performance , ' @entity111 adds			2
' we 're trying to keep our astronauts alive , safe , and mobile , but these designs are not just for use in space			0

@entity18 suit automatically shrinks itself to become a ' second skin '
skintight , pressurized suit would support the astronaut
gives much more freedom to move during planetary exploration
could also lead to shape changing clothes for athletes and *soldiers*
