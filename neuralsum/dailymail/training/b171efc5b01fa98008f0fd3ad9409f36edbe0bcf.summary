@entity0 has baulked at suggestions @entity2 must bolster their defence in the january transfer window			1
manager @entity5 claimed @entity2 have ' more than enough ' defensive cover and quality , despite @entity9 's groin problem further stretching resources			1
@entity11 's double sneaked @entity2 past @entity12 2 - 1 at @entity13 's on monday but they struggled tactically and defensively			1
@entity2 defender @entity9 ( left ) was taken off injured against @entity12 on monday @entity14 ( right ) was substituted late in the first half after a disappointing performance at @entity13 's @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19 are out injured , as is @entity20 , who could slot in as an emergency centre half			1
@entity5 shrugged off criticism of his defensive stocks after switching @entity26 midfielder @entity25 into a makeshift defensive role midway through monday 's clash			0
' when you have injuries you can not solve the problem otherwise , ' said @entity5			0
' do we have to buy players ? no. we have more than enough			0
' @entity5 's terse defence of his squad depth did little to mask @entity2 's continued rearguard shortcomings			1
@entity37 converted @entity2 's only two chances on the south coast as @entity5 's men moved third in the @entity41 with a fifth - straight win			2
@entity12 pressed continually , pulling @entity5 's systems and structures apart almost at will , though too often failing to deliver the killer blow			2
@entity2 boss @entity0 believes he does not need to strengthen his defence in january fit - again @entity47 ( right ) replaced the injured @entity9 during the opening period against @entity12 @entity50 's inept performance forced @entity5 to haul youngster @entity14 off before half - time , in the hope @entity53 could add midfield bite			1
that led to @entity25 's rearguard shift , with fit - again @entity47 replacing @entity9 after his groin injury			1
@entity2 are still missing @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity20 , and that injured defensive quartet formed the foundation of @entity5 's justification of his squad depth			2
@entity2 host @entity64 at @entity66 on sunday , with former defender @entity62 predicting the clash could descend into pub - league standard			2
@entity26 coach @entity62 claimed @entity2 ' got away with murder ' at @entity13 's , before tipping the @entity64 clash to resemble ' @entity70 versus the @entity71 '			0
the unimpressed @entity5 warned @entity62 to ' pay attention to his words ' , asking reporters to interpret his comments however they saw fit			0
midfielder @entity25 ( right ) dropped into @entity2 's defence after @entity5 brought off @entity14 @entity62 later denied talk of a rift with @entity5 when asked about a ' feud ' on social media			1
one @entity83 user asked @entity62 following the match : ' @ r1fgm : @ @entity86 the press mentioning a feud between yourself and @entity5			0
what feud ? ' and @entity62 replied : ' one that will be created that does n't exist			0
