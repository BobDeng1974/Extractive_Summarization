by @entity0 published : 04:58 est , 10 may 2013 updated : 05:17 est , 10 may 2013 locked up : @entity1 , who has been sentenced to 15 years of ' compulsory labour ' by @entity3 for unspecified crimes against the state a @entity8 sentenced to 15 years hard labour in @entity3 was a missionary who smuggled in inflammatory literature and trying to establish a base for @entity14 activities at a border city hotel , the state 's @entity6 said			1
@entity1 , 44 , was sentenced earlier this month after being detained late last year leading a tour group in the @entity3 city of @entity18 , on the border with @entity20			1
@entity3 delivered its most in - depth account yet of the case against mr @entity1 today , but the long list of allegations included no statement from him , other than claims that he confessed and did n't want an attorney present during his sentencing last week for what @entity30 called hostile acts against the state			1
since the sentencing came during a period of tentative diplomatic moves following weeks of high tension and @entity3 threats of nuclear and missile strikes on @entity42 and @entity43 , outside analysts have said @entity30 may be using @entity1 as bait to win diplomatic concessions in the standoff over its nuclear weapons program			1
@entity3 repeated its denial of such speculation in the new statement , but the pattern has occurred repeatedly			0
the @entity3 's state media described the statement from an unidentified @entity6 spokesman as a response to @entity58 government and media assertions that the legal case against @entity1 was unreasonable and other claims ' that he was not tried in a transparent manner and ( the @entity62 ) was trying to use this issue as a political bargaining chip			1
' the spokesman said @entity1 could 've faced death but the court reduced the penalty because he confessed			1
@entity1 , a @entity42 state resident described by friends as a devout @entity69 and a tour operator , is at least the sixth @entity58 detained in @entity3 since 2009			1
the others eventually were deported or released without serving out their terms , some after trips to @entity30 by prominent @entity58 , including former presidents @entity75 and @entity77			0
there has been no sign yet of a high - profile @entity58 envoy set to make a clemency mission to @entity3 , which has only recently eased a near - daily , weekslong torrent of threats that followed greater @entity86 sanctions over @entity30 's february nuclear test			0
tensions : the sentencing of @entity1 will further complicate already strained relations between @entity30 and @entity42			1
@entity3 leader @entity91 ( 3rd left ) is pictured at a soccer match the @entity62 's statement said @entity1 gave anti-pyongyang lectures in @entity20 and ' infiltrated ' about 250 students into the city of @entity18 , a special economic zone in @entity3 's far northeastern region bordering @entity20 and @entity100			1
it did n't elaborate on the students ' activities , however			2
young leader @entity91 has the power to grant special pardons under the @entity3 's constitution			0
earlier this week , former @entity108 star @entity107 attempted to use his friendship with @entity91 on @entity1 's behalf , asking the leader to ' do me a solid ' and release the @entity58			1
@entity107 visited @entity3 in february and apparently hit it off with @entity91 , a die - hard basketball fan			2
@entity30 has n't responded to @entity107 's appeal on @entity113			0
@entity107 said after his trip to @entity3 that he planned to return in august to vacation with @entity91			0
buds : @entity107 , left , has called on @entity3 's leader @entity91 , right , to release @entity58 prisoner @entity1 ( mr @entity107 with @entity91 in february during his visit to @entity3 ) @entity119 : the former @entity108 star took to @entity113 to send an informal plea to the @entity3 leader the @entity58 has called for the @entity3 to immediately release @entity1			1
it relies on @entity124 diplomats in @entity30 to deal with @entity1 's case because the @entity3 and the @entity58 have had no formal diplomatic relations since the 1950 - 53 @entity127 ended in a truce instead of a peace treaty			2
@entity3 said in the statement that @entity1 ' set up plot - breeding bases in different places of @entity20 for the purpose of toppling ( @entity3 's ) government from 2006 to october 2012 out of distrust and enmity toward the ' country			2
' he committed such hostile acts as egging citizens of ( @entity3 ) overseas and foreigners on to perpetrate hostile acts to bring down its government while conducting a malignant smear campaign against it			0
he was caught red handed			0
' award : @entity149 @entity148 , a traffic policewoman of a district branch of the @entity151 of the @entity153 's @entity152 receiving the coveted ' @entity155 ' award in @entity30 speculation : the unusual award of a top medal for bravery to a @entity3 traffic policewoman has fuelled speculation that she might have intervened in an incident that had threatened the life of leader @entity91 @entity3 refers to @entity1 as @entity165 , the @entity3 spelling for his @entity3 name			2
@entity3 has faced increasing international criticism over its weapons development			0
six - nation disarmament talks involving the @entity171 , the @entity58 , @entity172 , @entity20 and @entity100 fell apart in 2009			0
several rounds of @entity86 sanctions have not encouraged the @entity3 to give up its small cache of nuclear devices , which @entity30 says it must not only keep but expand to protect itself from a hostile @entity42			0
tensions have escalated since it conducted its third nuclear test since 2006 in february			0
the human rights group @entity179 has criticized @entity1 's lack of access to a lawyer and called for his release			1
friends and colleagues say @entity1 was based in the @entity20 border city of @entity187 and traveled frequently to @entity3 to feed orphans .			2
