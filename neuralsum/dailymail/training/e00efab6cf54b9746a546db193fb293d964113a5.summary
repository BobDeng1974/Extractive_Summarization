@entity0 , pictured , who says that seeing a woman 's face when testifying in court is important and necessary women giving evidence in court should not be allowed to hide behind the veil , one of the country ’s most senior judges said yesterday			1
@entity0 said judges should be able to insist that women reveal their faces to juries when necessary			1
she said she had come to the conclusion after ordering a mother in a family court case to remove her veil – when she realised the woman had been lying			1
@entity0 said : ‘ we should devise ways of making it possible and insisting people show their full face when it is necessary			1
there must come a point where we can insist			0
’ the deputy president of the @entity29 has spoken out after a decade of controversy over whether @entity32 witnesses and lawyers should be allowed to keep their faces covered in the courtroom			1
despite a promise last year from the lord chief justice , lord @entity37 , of a public consultation and clear new rules , the senior judiciary has been stalling , leaving judges and magistrates to decide for themselves what to do on a case - by - case basis			2
taking up the issue , @entity0 said : ‘ we do n’t object to allowing people to do things for sincerely held religious reasons if they do n’t do any harm			1
if it does harm , we have to be a bit tougher			0
’ recalling her own experience , she told how a mother in a family case arrived at court in ‘ full purdah ’			2
‘ in that particular case it really was very obvious both that she loved her children fantastically and that there were occasions when she was lying , ’ @entity0 said			1
‘ i do n’t think it would have been as obvious if i had only been able to see her eyes			0
‘ there are other situations , not only giving evidence , when it is necessary to be able to recognise people and identify people			1
if it is necessary to see their face , then ways have got to be found to allow that to happen			2
’ @entity75 , left , who refused to remove her niqab full face veil , right , while standing trial at @entity78 last year a number of senior figures , including former justice secretary @entity81 , have made it clear that they believe judges should be able to insist that a witness remove a veil			1
the lord chief justice has said that it is the responsibility of the senior judiciary to give guidance , and last year promised a public consultation ‘ in the very near future ’			2
@entity93 's barrister @entity92 had successfully argued at a pre-trial hearing that her client had a right to wear the niqab in court lord @entity37 and fellow senior judges had been waiting for the @entity100 to give a view on @entity103 laws which ban the wearing of the burka or niqab in public places			1
the @entity108 judges ruled in july that the @entity103 ban was justified in the cause of social cohesion			0
however , the consultation has not materialised			0
lord @entity37 said last month : ‘ we have not got back to taking it into account , but i would hope to be able to do so as soon as is reasonably practicable			0
’ he explained that other , more pressing issues had come to the fore , adding : ‘ there have been , one might say , some other problems but not that one			0
’ one case in which the veil was an issue was the trial in january of @entity32 convert @entity75 at @entity78 in @entity124			1
she refused to remove her niqab to give evidence in her trial for witness intimidation despite the demands of the judge			1
eventually she chose not to go into the witness box , claiming it was against her religious beliefs to show her face to men			2
later she was jailed for six months after changing her plea to guilty			0
@entity0 also spoke out on the issue of divorce in an interview with the @entity140 , joining a list of senior judges calling for measures to make the process easier for families			2
previously she proposed no - fault divorce laws when she was head of the @entity147 in the 1990s			0
@entity149 ’s government adopted her plans , but the scheme proved unworkable and the idea was dropped by @entity153			0
reviving the issue , she said : ‘ you would make a declaration that your marriage had irretrievably broken down and if you were still of that view a year later , then you get your divorce			0
’ the most senior family law judge , sir @entity160 , has called for couples to be allowed to register a divorce at a register office without the involvement of the courts .			0

@entity0 says seeing a woman 's face in the courtroom is necessary
says she believes veils should be removed at *critical* points of a trial
pointed to a case where she found a woman was lying after removing veil
said it could be possible to use screens if people want to wear a veil
comes after a @entity32 convert refused to remove niqab in court last year
@entity75 said she had a right to wear her veil when giving evidence
