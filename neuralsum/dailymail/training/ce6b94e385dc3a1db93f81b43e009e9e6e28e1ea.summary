a @entity1 activist who used her ' story ' of being forced into the sex trade at a young age has resigned from her eponymous @entity6 - based charity after an investigation into her past			1
@entity9 shot to fame in recent years for her humanitarian work helping fight sex slavery , using a horrific story about her own personal experiences of being forced into - and then escaping - work as a prostitute			1
then - secretary of state @entity16 toured her charity 's facilities in @entity19 , @entity1 in october 2010 , and she has attracted the attention of celebrity activists like @entity22 and @entity23			2
holes started showing in her story as she started contradicting the timelines of her abuse that she wrote about in her memoir and told in interviews with @entity6 talk shows and news publications			2
resigned : @entity9 , pictured at a @entity33 fundraiser for her eponymous charity in october , has resigned following the results of an investigation into her past famous friends : @entity38 ( left ) and @entity39 ( right ) were among the celebrities who attended the october fundraiser for @entity9 's eponymous organization announcement : @entity9 's @entity6 foundation was created in 2007 and works closely with the international charity she and her ex-husband founded in 1996 two of the young girls she brought to the press - one of whom was featured on the @entity51 and the subject of reporter @entity54 's column in the @entity55 - have had their stories debunked as well			1
she has now resigned from her eponymous @entity6 foundation , which was created in 2007 to help aid the efforts of an earlier international charity , @entity59 , that @entity9 and her ex-husband launched in 1996			1
the international charity has not made any statements about the latest allegations			0
a spokeswoman for the @entity64 told @entity65 that @entity9 ' is not currently employed by @entity59 ' but is still known for her role as the charity 's co-founder			1
@entity9 claimed to be orphaned and taken in by a man she came to call her ' grandfather ' who went on to rape her repeatedly and forced her to marry a soldier at the age of 14 before eventually being sold to a brothel			1
she eventually escaped , met a @entity76 doctor who married her and took her back to @entity77 in the early 1990s where they launched their crusade to save other girls like her			1
they returned to @entity1 , set up safe houses and provided resources for the ' thousands ' of girls they rescued , all through a foundation they built in her name			0
accepting praise : @entity9 , pictured at left with a young girl she helped rescue from sex slavery , was named as one of @entity97 's women of the year in 2006 shortly after the publication of her book big names : queen @entity101 was the star to present @entity9 with the @entity97 award in 2006 @entity103 wrote a cover story about her in their latest issue detailing the ways in which her fraud unravelled in recent months			1
she and her now ex-husband , @entity111 , started to attract attention in the non-profit world and signed @entity114 up for interviews in order to promote their first organization , @entity59 , the full name of which in @entity76 meant ' helping women in @entity119 '			2
in 1998 , @entity9 gave a joint interview with one of the teenage girls she ' saved ' named @entity123 , who told a harrowing tale of how she was sold to a brothel and held as a sex slave			1
last year , that same woman came forward and said that @entity9 had coached her to say she was a child prostitute			0
' @entity9 said that ... if i want to help another woman i have to do ( the 1998 interview ) very well , ' ms @entity131 , who is now in her early 30s , told @entity103 last year			2
international attention : then - secretary of state @entity16 toured @entity9 's charity @entity59 's rehabilitation facility and met with some of the survivors in october 2010 fake stories : one of the poster children that @entity9 lauded in interviews was @entity140 ( who @entity141 is seen touching )			1
@entity140 claimed she was an orphan living at a brothel whose pimp stabbed her in the eye ; doctors records prove she was brought to the hospital by her parents and linked with @entity9 's group later the second woman who @entity9 held up as the survivor of trauma was @entity140 , who was featured in an extensive profile and accompanying video by @entity54 in @entity154 in 2009 , where she told him that her eye had been gouged out by her violent female owner after @entity140 asked for time off from prostitution following her second painful abortion			1
she told the same version of events to @entity162 and in a @entity164 documentary , but @entity103 has now debunked that			2
a doctor in @entity1 named @entity167 has before and after photos of @entity140 ' eye when she was brought in - by her parents - at age 13			0
this directly contradicts the timeline @entity140 had been espousing , since she had claimed to be sold to the brothel at that same age , and been working at the brothel for years - being given to at least four times to different men after being stitched up repeatedly and billed as a virgin - before her two abortions and brutal run - in with her boss who gouged her eye with a piece of metal			0
the hospital where dr @entity167 works , @entity183 , told @entity103 that they were the ones who put @entity140 in touch with @entity9 because they contacted her charity , @entity59 , to see if @entity140 could be enrolled in their vocational training course			2
selling her story : @entity9 , seen here during a @entity192 appearance in 2006 , admitted that she lied to the @entity193 about the @entity1 army killing some of the girls she rescued celebrity endorsements : @entity22 is just one of the famous @entity198 stars who has been a champion of @entity9 's cause for years close : @entity22 has been a longtime supporter of @entity9 's foundation , seen at left at the annual fundraiser in 2012 and at right in anti-sex trafficking event in 2010 those who know her say that @entity9 had a similar alternative life story : her parents are alive and raised her			1
she was a well - known and popular girl who attended a local high school from 1981 to 1987 and is remembered by her classmates for regularly wearing pigtails to school			0
she has also been caught in multiple lies on the public stage			0
after telling the @entity213 in 2012 that eight girls her organization rescued were later killed by the @entity1 army in 2004 , she admitted that she made up that story			0
she also told @entity97 in 2006 - when they named her one of their @entity218 - that her teenage daughter had been kidnapped and her captors video taped her being gang raped - all as retribution for the work @entity9 was doing			1
her ex and the charity ’s legal advisor both came out to say that she was never kidnapped but ran away with her boyfriend			0
international support : queen @entity231 ( left ) met with @entity9 on an official visit to @entity1 in 2008 ' her girls ' : @entity9 's personal story was used to bring attention to the cause and help fund the projects that aid thousands of abused young girls in @entity1 conflicting stories : @entity9 's book ( left ) was published in 2005 and a recent investigation by @entity242 ( right ) proved that much of what she said about her upbringing is false vouching for her : @entity245 - winning @entity55 columnist @entity54 , seen with her in 2012 , wrote the foreward to her book and profiled one of the ' rescued ' girls , whose story was proved a lie ' ( with donors ) , she ’s very polished and very on and very charming … exceedingly charming ... and when people are not there , she can be tyrannical ; she ’s moody , she ’s erratic , she ’s entitled , ' a former @entity59 volunteer psychologist told @entity103 about @entity9			1
in the statement issued by the @entity64 on wednesday , they tell how they hired a third party law firm @entity257 to investigate @entity9 ’s claims two months ago , and , upon hearing their results , they have now accepted her resignation			2
‘ @entity268 provided @entity257 unfettered access to our information , documents , and staff , and , for the past two months , a team of @entity257 legal professionals based out of @entity267 , @entity263 , and @entity264 conducted an extensive investigation , ’ the press release states			0
‘ as a result of @entity257 ’s efforts , we have accepted @entity9 ’s resignation effective immediately			0
‘ despite our heartfelt disappointment , the work of the @entity64 and our grant partners must and will carry on			0
we have touched the lives of over 100,000 women and girls			0
we have treated nearly 6,000 individuals at a free medical clinic in @entity287 ’s @entity286 and engaged nearly 6,400 students in anti-trafficking activism			0
