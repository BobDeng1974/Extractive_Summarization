the sunroof was n’t even open at the time , it must have smashed on the first roll			2
' as a double - glazing salesman i would n’t usually condone a flimsy bit of glass - but i ’m glad this shattered upon impact			2
' if it had n’t of then i would have been slammed into the roof and i ’d be dead			2
' it was just a freak of physics that i came out of the top and survived			2
lucky escape : @entity43 captures the car rolling over a garden wall into a front garden acrobatics : mr @entity9 completes an unintentional flip in mid-air as he flies straight out of the car ' my luck had not been in for most of the night at the bingo hall - but it certainly did come the end of the night			1

he said : ' we ’d met back up after about 10 years - there ’s nothing going on between us but you never know , my gymnastics might have impressed her			0

' but never say never			0
i do n’t want to say much more than that really			0
' lucky escape : while mr @entity9 walked away unharmed , ms @entity8 's @entity12 was not so lucky ms @entity8 , a divorced mother - of - two and officer worker , cried when she saw the @entity43 footage			1

' i remember in the seconds after it happened i look around and i could n’t see @entity9 anywhere			1
' i expected to find him half way down the road and then he just popped up next to the car			1
' i think i just said " bloody hell bab - are you alright ? " and he just stood next to the car in shock looking at me			1

' me and my wife @entity118 looked out of the bedroom window to see this car lying in our front garden			2
' this couple in their 30s were standing in front of the car hugging - i looked at them , then back at this mangled car and i thought " how on earth are they alive ? " ' when i checked the footage back it just compounded my amazement - their car just somersaulted and the man comes flying out the sunroof			1
the house and its garden wall which was left destroyed after the crash ' i ’ve caught people stealing my door mat on @entity43 before but never anything like this			1
' it was like something out of a police action film			0
somebody could have easily been killed if they had walking by			0
