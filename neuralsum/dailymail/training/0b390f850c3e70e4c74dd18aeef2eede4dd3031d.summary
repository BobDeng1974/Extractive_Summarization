a secret file on ‘ unnatural ’ sexual behaviour at @entity2 that was given to @entity3 has been discovered			1
the document contains allegations ‘ of unnatural sexual proclivities ’ against high - profile figures , and was prepared for the then prime minister in the 1980s			1
last night campaigning mp @entity9 suggested it may form part of a cover - up over a vip paedophile ring operating at the time			0
the paper was only discovered by chance by an academic while he was researching secret @entity3 files at the @entity40 in @entity41 , @entity42			1
child abuse campaigners have reacted with fury after it emerged the file was not handed over to an @entity48 review into government documents on child abuse			1
last night the @entity35 promised to reveal it to the government ’s child abuse inquiry , suggesting its contents are highly relevant			1
but campaigners said it should be made public and shown to the police to prevent any alleged abusers escaping justice			0
the file was found by dr @entity61 , a security and intelligence lecturer at the @entity64 , who was trawling though catalogue records at the @entity40 for security documents			1
the contents of the document remain secret , with only the title of the mystery file publicly listed as : ‘ @entity71			1
allegations against former public [ word missing ] of unnatural sexual proclivities ; security aspects 1980 oct 27 - 1981 mar 20			2
’ according to dr @entity61 , it was found among hundreds of so - called ‘ @entity82 ’ files – security documents that passed through the prime minister ’s office			1
research : dr @entity61 from the @entity64 found the new classified file and believes that because of its title @entity3 will have seen it he said : ‘ i do not know what are the contents of this document , but the fact that the file is headed security and went to the prime minister ’s office is suggestive of the fact that we are talking about someone ’s sexual behaviour becoming a matter of national security			1
’ despite the seeming importance of the document , @entity48 chief executive @entity100 who led last year ’s review into how the @entity102 handled child abuse allegations between 1979 and 1999 , said nobody showed it to him			2
he told @entity107 : ‘ if there is pertinent material in this file it should be submitted to the sexual abuse inquiry as well as the relevant police force so they can conduct a criminal investigation if necessary			1
’ last night mr @entity9 said : ‘ the question must be how many more files relate to prominent people , mps , politicians in relation to child abuse and why have they not been made available to @entity100 or the @entity122 ? ’ national security : the paperwork , listed by the @entity125 in @entity41 , pictured , has been classified for for 35 years on grounds of national security and is still in the hands of the @entity35 yesterday mrs @entity3 ’s former press secretary , sir @entity24 , told @entity107 he could not recall the file , although he said @entity3 was aware of allegations against a government minister in the early 1980s			1
she has previously been linked to the historic child abuse scandal after her former aide sir @entity134 was accused of raping an underage boy			1
a former bodyguard to @entity3 said he warned her of rumours about her private parliamentary secretary , but he was still appointed @entity140 deputy party chairman			1
sir @entity100 died in 1995 aged 51 and was never charged with any offence			0
secret life : sir @entity143 had a double identity and used to rent a flat to keep child pornography - but was only given a police caution diplomat sir @entity143 , a decorated diplomat who lived a secret life as a paedophile , was named by mp @entity149 in 1981 using parliamentary privilege			1
the new document , revealed today by @entity107 , was written about the same period			0
@entity143 was member ‘ 330 ’ of the @entity152 ( @entity152 ) , which supported and encouraged illegal sexual relationships between adults and children			2
he rented a flat at 95 @entity157 , @entity158 , @entity42 under the name of @entity160 to store @entity152 literature and graphic correspondence with fellow paedophiles			0
but sir @entity100 made a mistake and left a packet of paedophile material in an envelope on a @entity42 bus			0
it was addressed to mr @entity160 at @entity170 in @entity171 afterwards , in november 1978 , police raided the @entity170 flat			0
what they found there was a huge trove of paedophilia and other extreme pornography			0
among it was a library of 45 substantial diaries in which sir @entity100 had recorded in detail his sexual experiences and fantasies , the latter including sex with minors			2
even the hardened police of the @entity122 were ‘ revolted ’ by the @entity157 haul			2
he sobbed as he was interviewed and feared he would be exposed and his reputation ruined			0
and yet he was n't			0
much to the anger and disbelief of the @entity122 he was only given a caution			0
he died in 1992 aged 77			0
@entity149 also said that an unnamed senior civil servant was helping to run a paedophile ring from @entity195			0
the mp claimed the man had at least 57 obscene slides of men having sex with children			2
he said at the time : ' i 'm concerned about the cover - up of a senior civil servant who is a paedophile and wants sex with children legalised			2
he is a security risk ' .			0

@entity208 found paperwork still classified on national security grounds
it contains ' @entity213 ' in title - which means it was for @entity3
@entity3 's aide sir @entity24 says he ' could not recall the file '
but he and @entity134 were aware of abuse claims aimed at a minister , he said
@entity35 say file remains secret but may be released to abuse inquiry
the troubled inquiry into historic child sex abuse has *suspended* work until home secretary @entity227 makes a firm **decision** on its *future* . the independent panel will not hold any further meetings with *victims* until either a chairman is appointed or a **decision** is taken whether to *replace* it . on *tuesday* , one expert on the panel claimed she was being ‘ *bullied* and *intimidated* ’ by the **counsel** to the inquiry . the rest of the panel *distanced* themselves from the allegation , which the **counsel** also denied .
