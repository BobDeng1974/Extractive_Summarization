by @entity0 published : 19:03 est , 18 september 2013 updated : 06:35 est , 19 september 2013 @entity2 president @entity1 has maintained that he is defending his people from outside terrorist groups , saying that the country 's war is one that is helping his people on the whole			1
the doctor - turned - dictator was asked to compare his role in ordering the government forces to attack the rebels is similar to that of a surgeon getting rid of destructive portions of a sick person 's body			1
' doctors take the right decisions to protect the life of the patient because you ca n't say they do n't do harm physically , ' he said during an interview with @entity26 , making a reference to the @entity29 oath that all doctors			0
indignant : @entity2 president @entity1 used his latest televised interview to say that there is still no evidence that his soldiers used chemical weapons ' the same for a politician : a doctor deals with one patient and the politicians deal with the public			1
' the question is whether your decision should help the lives of the @entity2 or not			2
nobody likes the violence ... but what do you do when the terrorists attack your government ? ' during a televised interview with @entity26 that aired wednesday night , the @entity2 president rejected the findings of the @entity55 report that declared that an attack involving sarin gas did occur in the country on august 21			1
first due no harm : @entity1 was asked about the @entity60 he was forced to take as a doctor , and if that applied to him as a politician he did not deny that the attack occurred - saying that ' it 's despicable , it 's a crime ' - but he did clearly try to distance his forces from any culpability			2
' @entity69 gas is called the kitchen gas you know why ? because you can make it anywhere , ' he said			2
@entity1 said that the evidence cited in the @entity55 report was not all of the proof and did not prove that the weapons were used by his armed forces			2
' they have the samples and they 're supposed to be objective ... the information is different than evidence , ' he said of the @entity55 report			0
' no one has verified the credibility of the video and the pictures			0
the only verified things are the samples from victims			0
' you can not build a report on videos , its not verified			0
you have a lot of forgery on the internet , ' he said making a clear reference to the videos of dying victims that the @entity100 made publicly available first to @entity101 and @entity102 but then also to the @entity104 public when president @entity105 was building his case for a retaliatory missile attack			1
the interview marks the second that the @entity2 president has approved with @entity112 journalists since the august 21 chemical weapons attack outside of @entity114			1
the first was with @entity116 for @entity117 and the interview that aired today on @entity26 was arranged through former @entity120 congressman @entity119			0
during the interview with @entity122 , @entity1 did not say whether his government was in control of chemical weapons and during the @entity26 interview he said that they clearly do since they have agreed to the international proposal to turn over their stockpile			1
sit down : @entity1 was interviewed by former @entity120 congressman @entity119 ( left ) and @entity26 reporter @entity130 ( next to @entity119 ) inside the presidential palace in @entity114 ' it 's not a secret anymore , ' @entity1 said			2
' we never said no , we never said yes but we always say it is a classified issue			0
' during the hour - long interview , @entity1 maintained that he did not necessarily agree with the number of fatalities that have occurred since the onslaught of the civil war in @entity2 two years ago - nor did he even agree that it should be categorized as a civil war			1
he said that the large number of missing individuals makes it impossible for there to be a firm number of more than 100,000 people killed in the country - which has been widely accepted by @entity112 governments as well as the @entity55			0
‘ we have tens of thousands of @entity2 who have died ... mainly because of terrorists and bombs , ’ he said			1
' we have thousands of missing people , we do n't know if they 're dead or not dead ...			0
this is a human tragedy its not about numbers			0
' i can not minimize it ( the death toll ) because in every house you have pain today , in every house your have sadness			0
' under attack : @entity1 maintained that the government was continually being attacked by outside terrorist groups who are masquerading as internal opposition forces @entity1 continually asserted that the rebels and opposition forces originate from outside of @entity2 , claiming that his country embraces opposition and allows them to exist since they have ‘ grassroots ’ in the homeland			1
the people fighting @entity2 government forces now , @entity1 said , are funded and come from other countries and the large majority of them - 80 to 90 per cent - have ties to @entity183			1
‘ what we have is not civil war what we have is war but it ’s a new kind of war , ’ he said			0
' we are defending our country			0
if you do not defend , this number will be many fold , ' he said of the disputed death count			0
' @entity1 said that in spite of the months of heated rhetoric and outright threats from the @entity104 , he does not see @entity104 as opposition - even though he previously said that the country should ' expect everything ' if president @entity105 did order a missile strike against @entity2			1
' we never looked at the @entity104 as ( an ) enemy , ' @entity1 said in tuesday 's interview			1
' @entity207 of all the @entity104 because they 're the greatest country in the world , that 's self evident ... we want to have good relations of course			1
' he went on to say that once an international agreement is settled regarding the collection and destruction of the @entity2 nuclear weapons , he will make sure that it will be put into effect			1
' we want to fully cooperate with this agreement , not partially , ' @entity1 said			0
horror : the @entity105 administration has released a series of videos ( pictured ) of the victims from the august 21 attack , but in today 's interview @entity1 said there is no way to know the video is not a fake attacks : the chemical gas attacks occurred on august 21 in the rebel strongholds near @entity234 and was thought to have left more than 1,000 dead there is a tentatively - scheduled presidential election in @entity2 in the spring of next year , and while he ' won ' his last election with 97.6 per cent of the vote in 2007 , he said that the people should feel fully entitled to nominate a different candidate if they do not like his leadership			1
in spite of the ongoing war , he maintains that his rule is still a good one for his people			0
' i would say i am the hope of the @entity2 ... other states - they are much farther from democracy than the @entity2 state , ' @entity1 said			2
the hour - long @entity26 interview took place on tuesday inside the presidential palace in @entity114 but aired on wednesday evening in the @entity104			2
the interview was taped by a @entity2 news crew but @entity257 was in the control room at the time and it was aired in full on @entity26			2
' on saturday , sept. 7 , ... @entity119 advised me that he believed he could secure an interview with … @entity1 , whom he had met on previous occasions , ' @entity26 executive vice president of news @entity257 said in a statement to @entity265			0
' at the time , it appeared that an @entity104 military attack on @entity2 was imminent , and i decided that @entity119 should pursue the interview , on condition that @entity26 journalists would also be included			1
' mr @entity119 has worked for @entity26 as a contributor since january , but during the interview he was accompanied by the network 's @entity274 correspondent @entity130 .			0

@entity2 president admitted that ' it 's not a secret ' that they have chemical weapons but said that they will agree to hand them over to be destroyed
still denies that the august 21 sarin gas attack *stemmed* from his troops
said that his government must fight back against the ' terrorists ' who he believes have come into @entity2 from other countries and @entity183
called @entity104 the ' greatest country in the world ' but also said he has never spoken with president @entity105
