by @entity0 and @entity1 and @entity2 in just four years , space tourists could be blasting into orbit from one of eight sites named today as possible locations for the @entity9 ’s first spaceport			1
six of the sites are in @entity12 , including @entity13 and @entity14			1
@entity15 has been selected in @entity16 and @entity17 in @entity18			1
all sites have to meet strict criteria , including being a safe distance from densely populated areas and a runway that can be extended to more than 3,000m ( 9,842ft )			1
@entity9 's first commercial spaceport could be based in any one of these eight locations , and would act as a hub for flights by sir @entity29 's @entity28 and @entity30 the aim is to use the spaceport to launch tourists into space as well as commercial satellites			1
the move is designed to take advantage of the anticipated burgeoning space tourism industry			2
by 2030 , the @entity9 government hopes to capture 10 per cent of the world ’s space market			1
if this target is met , opening up the @entity9 tourism industry to specialist operators such as @entity28 and @entity45 could be worth £ 40 billion and provide 100,000 jobs			1
making the announcement at the @entity48 , aviation minister @entity49 said : ' in order to lead the way on commercial space flight , we will need to establish a spaceport that enables us to operate regular flights			2
@entity29 's dream to charter commercial space flights has taken a step closer to reality			2
his company , @entity28 , yesterday signed a deal with @entity63 aviation authorities to let it blast paying customers into space on @entity66 ( pictured ) @entity67 ( @entity12 ) @entity13 ( @entity12 ) @entity68 ( @entity18 ) @entity69 ( @entity16 ) @entity70 ( @entity12 ) @entity71 ( @entity12 ) @entity14 ( @entity12 ) @entity72 ( @entity12 ) ' the work published today has got the ball rolling - now we want to work with others to take forward this exciting project and have @entity9 ’s first spaceport up and running by 2018			1
' there have been reports that the government is hoping @entity28 boss sir @entity29 will build the port as part of his @entity28 project			2
@entity28 ’s first flights are scheduled to take off from a purpose - built spaceport in @entity87 , @entity63 , at the start of the year , with passengers paying £ 120,000 ( $ 206,000 ) for a 150 - minute flight that will climb to heights of around 62 miles ( 100km ) to achieve zero gravity for approximately six minutes			2
the spaceport will have its own dedicated and separate air space in order to manage flights into orbit safely			2
after a period of consultation , the @entity9 government said further work will be done to develop those locations remaining on the site shortlist			1
@entity45 is based at the @entity104 in @entity105			0
its @entity107 spacecraft , illustration pictured , seats two people - the passenger and a pilot - and tickets cost $ 95,000 ( £ 57,000 )			0
this is almost two thirds the price of sir @entity29 's @entity66 business secretary @entity116 said : ' space is big business for the @entity9			1
it already contributes £ 11.3 billion to the economy each year , supporting nearly 35,000 jobs			0
new figures show that the space industry employs 34,000 people and contributes £ 11billion to economy ' that ’s why it ’s important for us to prepare the @entity9 for new launcher technology and take steps towards meeting our ambition of establishing the first @entity9 spaceport by 2018			1
' exploring the opportunities that commercial space flight presents , and potentially making strategic investments in this area , will support the growth of this thriving industry and underpin the economy of tomorrow , making the @entity9 the place for space			1
' sources told the @entity143 that the need for the base to be ‘ remote ’ and secure meant there was more chance it would be on a @entity12 site			1
over the weekend , treasury chief secretary @entity149 , mp for @entity150 , talked up the chances of @entity12 leading the @entity9 drive to open up ‘ the final frontier of commercial space travel ’			1
he said : ‘ @entity12 has a proud association with space exploration			1
we celebrated @entity158 ’s @entity12 ancestry when he became the first man on the moon and only last week an amazing @entity12 company was responsible for building the @entity163 ’s first satellite			1
’ but sources also privately made clear it was ‘ highly unlikely ’ the spaceport would ever be built in @entity12 if it voted for independence in september ’s referendum			1
@entity169 said : ‘ an independent @entity12 would be free to bid for this sort of thing but i doubt it would have the resources to do it			1
’ @entity28 - sir @entity29 's @entity173 and @entity175 the company 's @entity66 holds two pilots and six passengers who are seated with two large windows , one to the side and one overhead , so they can enjoy the view if they do not want to float freely when they achieve weightlessness			0
the @entity184 is 60ft long with a 90 - inch diameter cabin			0
the spaceship is connected to @entity28 's carrier aircraft @entity187 and when it reaches the right altitude , @entity184 is released and propelled forward and upward , accelerating into space at almost 2,500mph			2
clients have paid $ 250,000 ( £ 150,000 ) for a ticket , including celebrities such as @entity194 , @entity195 and @entity196			2
the @entity184 ( pictured below ) completed its third supersonic test flight in january			0
space adventures - @entity199 space adventures has arranged all eight of the flights to orbital space - when the spacecraft is travelling fast enough to go into orbit - completed by seven private citizens so far			2
@entity9 soprano @entity205 is due to be the next passenger and is scheduled to travel to the @entity207 in october 2015			1
the company has partnered with @entity199 to offer suborbital flights to space			0
the @entity199 suborbital rocket seats two passengers and is flown autonomously from the mission control centre			0
it lands and takes off vertically while the large windows offer panoramic views of the @entity217 and sky			0
the rocket reaches 100km above earth and uses ethanol and liquid oxygen fuelled engines , which have flown more than 200 test flights in the last decade			0
@entity225 - set up by @entity227 founder @entity226 the vehicle includes a crew capsule carrying three or four astronauts on a separate rocket - powered propulsion module			0
following lift - off , the combined vehicles accelerate for about two - and - a - half minutes before the propulsion module shuts off its rocket engines and separates from the crew capsule			0
the propulsion module finishes its flight , descends to @entity217 , and autonomously performs a rocket - powered vertical landing while the crew capsule coasts to the edge of space			0
after descent and re-entry into @entity217 's atmosphere , the crew capsule will land under parachutes near the launch site			0
@entity247 @entity247 's @entity249 reusable development vehicle ( pictured right ) is already in test mode and it will eventually deliver the smaller @entity251 containing humans into space			0
@entity254 made history in 2012 when it became the first commercial spacecraft to deliver cargo to the @entity207 and safely return cargo to @entity217 , a feat previously achieved only by governments			0
astrium the business jet - sized spaceplane will take off and land conventionally from a standard airport runway using its jet engines			0
at an altitude of about 12km , the rocket engine will be ignited and in only 80 seconds the craft will climb to 60km altitude			0
the rocket propulsion system will then be shut down as the plane ’s inertia carries it on to over 100km , enabling passengers to hover weightlessly			0
operators using the spaceplane could offer safe space flight for a price per passenger of around € 200,000 ( £ 120,000 ) .			0

six of the eight sites are in @entity12 , including @entity13 , @entity70 , @entity67 and @entity72
@entity15 has been selected in @entity16 and @entity68 in @entity18
the port will be used to launch tourists into space as well as satellites
by 2030 , the @entity9 hopes to capture 10 per cent of world ’s space market
