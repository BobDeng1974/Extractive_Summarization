published : 06:39 est , 28 march 2013 updated : 08:12 est , 28 march 2013 lingerie giant @entity0 has come under fire for ' sexualising ' young girls with its latest underwear range which features thongs with the slogans ' call me ' and ' i dare you ' written across them			1
outraged parents have accused the group of portraying young teenage girls ' as sex objects ' with the provocative designs			1
the company insisted the collection was aimed at ' over 17s ' but even its chief finance officer has suggested 15 - year - old girls could wear the clothing range			1
' this is despite @entity0 claiming it released the line to coincide with @entity58 's college student 's spring break - gearing it towards 17 and 18 - year - olds			1
parenting website @entity60 said mr @entity22 's statement will astonish parents			0
@entity64 , from @entity65 , said : ' @entity0 is a brand built on selling sex			1
from the world famous raunchy fashion shows to neon bright colours and the skimpiest designs on the high street , the company has always promoted its products as overtly sexual			2
' so for a top boss to claim the new teens range is designed to make underage girls look and feel older is a major marketing mistake which will horrify parents			2
' there is enough pressure on young girls to grow up far too fast without clothing firms telling them they have to look like sexy adults while they are still in school			1
i wonder if the firm 's bosses would be comfortable with their own child wearing this ? ' the provocative new line - advertised under the motto @entity32 - has appalled parents who claim the company is ' sexualising ' their daughters			1
inappropriate : mr @entity22 claimed the range 's ' magic ' was helping 15 - year - olds to feel older with its designs , such as this pink and orange thong with the slogan ' call me ' on the wild side : angry parents claims the range and ' @entity32 ' advertising campaign portrays teens as sexual objects many took to the company â€™s @entity110 page to express their anger at the firm which uses top models @entity114 and @entity116 in its advertising campaigns			1
there is even a petition demanding that the advertising campaign be withdrawn and that the @entity32 line not target teenagers at all			2
in a letter on @entity125 to @entity0 ceo @entity126 , it is accused of hiring ' younger looking teen models who are scantily clad and provocatively posed '			1
it also objects to the slogan ' @entity32 ' because it ' refers to young women as " things			0
" ' it read : ' by choosing to target teenagers with your new line , you are condoning teen sexuality and portraying teens as sexual objects			2
' @entity0 responded to the complaints with a statement on its @entity110 page , insisting that it has no plans to launch a line for girls not old enough to attend college			1
' in response to questions we recently received , @entity34 is a brand for college - aged women , ' it read			1
' despite recent rumors , we have no plans to introduce a collection for younger women			2
' " @entity32 " was a slogan used in conjunction with the college spring break tradition			0
' promotional opportunity : the @entity32 campaign was launched to tie in with @entity161 despite the company 's assurances , hundreds of parents are threatening to boycott the chain			0
one commenter wrote : ' you are selling out a generation of young women to make a buck with your " @entity32 " line			0
it is irresponsible and disgusting to market that level of sexually suggestive items to girls			0
as an adult , i will no longer be shopping in your store			0
' another wrote : ' you already do enough to undermine real woman 's and young ladies self esteem - now you want further sexualize our daughters [ sic ]			0
' and one women admitted to being a longtime fan of the brand , yet refuses to shop there any longer			0
' i have shopped regularly at @entity0 for a decade and will no longer be supporting your business , ' she wrote			1
' it 's a shame because i love your product , but i can not support a company that seeks to sexualize children			0
' but not everyone is unhappy with the new offerings in the @entity34 range			1
earlier this month , a conservative mommy blogger shocked fellow parents by admitting that she has no problem with her nine - year - old shopping at @entity0			1
@entity202 , from @entity203 , @entity204 , sparked fierce debate on parenting site @entity207 , when wrote that she did n't want daughter @entity209 ' to be the girl with the ugly underwear ' at camp or slumber parties			0
she later told @entity214 : ' i do n't think there 's anything wrong with having cute panties and bras from the big girl store			0
' but many other mothers took issue with her decision , arguing that the lingerie giant is ' too sexy ' , ' not intended for children ' , and that mrs @entity202 is at risk of oversexualizing the youngster at too young an age			0
one commenter on the @entity214 website wrote : ' it 's one thing to get your daughter cute , bright colored , fun underthings , but @entity0 is geared for sexy , not cute			2
' another wrote on the stir : ' are you people serious ? she is nine years old			0
i have four girls and as long as they are under my roof , i will not allow such clothing			2
' debate : hundreds of parents have threatened to boycott the chain on its @entity110 page sparking debate : mommy blogger @entity202 , from @entity203 , @entity204 , wrote that she has no problem with daughter @entity209 , nine , wearing @entity252 's @entity251 underwear			0

@entity0 says its @entity34 collection is aimed at girls over- 17s
new line includes thongs with slogans such as ' call me ' and ' i dare you '
but its chief finance officer said @entity34 clothing can be worn by 15 - year - olds
