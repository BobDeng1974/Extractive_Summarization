if they did n't know it already , @entity0 has issued a gentle warning to @entity5 's next generation of exciting starlets that he can not absorb them all into his first - team squad			1
' i can not have a squad of 10 men and 10 kids , ' said @entity0 , as his club prepare for their fourth successive @entity15 final , at @entity16			1
ask around about youth development and most experts feel @entity5 are getting it right at @entity21 level			2
@entity0 has issued a gentle warning to @entity5 's next generation that he can not use them all at once @entity5 captain @entity25 celebrates with the trophy after victory in the @entity29 final @entity30 has been part of the the first - team at @entity5 and is set to get his chance next season the under 19s won the @entity29 last week and the @entity35 will attempt to defend the @entity15 against @entity16 , another club working hard with some signs of success in this area			1
neither of them , however , has quite solved the problem of bridging the final void , converting this prized talent into first - team footballers			1
@entity45 was the last at @entity5 , but one or two of this crop are considered to have a genuine chance and @entity0 has promised 19 - year - old @entity30 his opportunity next season			1
' next season , @entity52 will not be a kid in the development process , ' said @entity0			2
' he will be a first - team player , absolutely ready to play and compete			1
and we will do the same with two or three or four players			0
' some of the older ones will go on loan to play every game in the championship or the @entity61 , even abroad			0
and we will bring some of the younger ones into the process			0
but to have them all at the same time in the first - team squad is hard			1
' i can not have a squad of 10 men and 10 kids			0
i must have a squad like we have now of 16 or 17 seniors and three or four kids			0
' @entity45 was the last truly successful youth product at @entity5 and he has gone on to become captain @entity45 celebrates after @entity5 beat @entity75 on saturday to tighten their grip on the title strikers @entity25 , 18 , and @entity78 , 17 , are earmarked for big things , but @entity30 , at @entity5 since the age of eight , has precisely what @entity0 wants in his midfield			1
he is tall , strong , athletic , and has poise on the ball			0
he is not dissimilar to @entity86 in style and might just save the club £ 70million they might otherwise be tempted to spend on someone like @entity90 from @entity91			0
this would be an enormous boost for @entity5 as they wriggle within the confines of @entity29 's @entity95			2
strikers @entity25 , 18 , and @entity78 , 17 , are earmarked for big things after the @entity98 success @entity30 , at @entity5 since the age of eight , has precisely what @entity0 wants in his first - team midfield @entity0 would like extra muscle in central midfield for the big games			1
his experiments with @entity105 alongside @entity86 have gone quite well , but ideally , he would prefer someone who can perform the same defensive duties and still flex into attack with pace and vision			0
also , he will need @entity105 at centre half			0
@entity90 would strengthen @entity0 's team but what signal would that send to @entity30 , and the rest of those striving to graduate at @entity115 and the give the club something it craves ? the @entity5 manager said : ' from that team that won the @entity29 , four belong to my squad			1
four are my players , first - team players who train with the first - team every day and develop with the first - team			1
when they 're not selected with the first - team - and normally they 're not selected - they go back and play there			1
' their development is easier when they 're training every day with the first - team , doing pre-season , playing some matches , playing 20 minutes or half an hour in an @entity139 match , @entity129 match , even a @entity131 match or in the league now and again			1
the tall , powerful midfielder got his chance to play at @entity142 against @entity143 in december @entity90 is a player @entity5 are looking at but would cost £ 70million , a cost they could do with avoiding ' they belong to a process			2
i ca n't have 10 of these young players in my squad but i can have three or four and we did that with @entity30 , @entity25 , ( @entity151 ) @entity150 and ( @entity153 ) @entity152 - and @entity78 a few times			1
' in tandem with this quest to nurture their own , @entity5 still cast around the globe and are scrambling to sign 19 - year - old @entity157 striker @entity153 from @entity158 and 22 - year - old @entity159 from @entity160			2
when these names were thrown his way , @entity0 shrugged and replied : ' i 'm not working on that , not at all			2
i do n't make offers , i coach players			2
' on @entity153 , he added : ' he 's a player that our structure followed , and our structure thinks it 's a player with potential for the future			0
@entity5 are set to announce the £ 4.5million signing of @entity157 wonderkid @entity153 as part of their recruitment @entity160 forward @entity159 is another player @entity5 are interested in but @entity0 is not involved ' if the deal is close , i will try to help him , as i try to help everyone , to become a @entity5 player			1
but he 's not a player in my squad now , or a player i 'm waiting for			0
i 'm focused just on my job and my team			0
the objective we are fighting for , i love it too			0
' his words reinforced the impression that one branch of @entity5 's development arm is busily signing , loaning and selling footballers with a view to economic gain ; making money while hedging its bets in case one of these players turn out to be extra special			2
while another branch is focused more closely on producing players who might one day represent the club			0
@entity202 is enjoying a very successful loan spells this season could force @entity0 into playing him there is cross-over in the middle , of course , with those like @entity202 and @entity210 enjoying very successful loan spells this season and perhaps forcing @entity0 one day soon to consider if they are worth a chance in his squad			1
but as the manager has made clear , all these players are fighting for a maximum of ' three or four ' places in the squad			0
it is a daunting task .			0

@entity5 have a successful *academy* playing in the @entity15 final
but as yet there have been few graduates into the @entity230 first - team side
@entity0 has *pledged* to bring players through but issued a warning
@entity236 coach says he can not absorb all young players into his squad
@entity240 has been promised a chance , plus two to four more
@entity5 recruit youth from around the world for profit and their squad
