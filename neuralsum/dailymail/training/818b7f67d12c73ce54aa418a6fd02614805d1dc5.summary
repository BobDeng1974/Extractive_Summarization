by @entity0 published : 07:18 est , 24 may 2013 updated : 18:25 est , 24 may 2013 mix - up : @entity2 , 66 , realised her old classmates believed she was dead friends of @entity2 were shocked to read news of her untimely death at the age of just 34			1
so they were even more shocked when she got in touch three decades later – to organise a reunion			0
mrs @entity2 was very much alive – and oblivious to the fact that a local newspaper had mistakenly announced her death in 1980			1
in fact it was her mother @entity16 who had passed away , but when @entity2 arranged for the death notice to be published the women ’s names were switched			1
mrs @entity2 was completely unaware of the error and moved abroad , oblivious to the fact that her schoolfriends in @entity24 , @entity22 were grieving			1
the mistake only came to light when she called her old chums to organise a get - together			2
now a 66 - year - old artist living in @entity30 , she was preparing to revisit her childhood home and contacted friends from @entity35 ’s @entity34			1
she explained : ‘ i got in touch with @entity37 and she sounded very odd			0
it was n’t quite the reception i was expecting from an old friend			0
‘ she rang me back and said “ i ’m terribly sorry , but we all thought you were dead ”			0
‘ looking back i was in a bit of a state when i rang the newspaper because i ’d just lost my mum			2
‘ but i can remember the man specifically asking for mother ’s name at the start of the call , and then asking for mine at the end			2
‘ at the time i was @entity57 and she was a @entity2 – so it seemed impossible to mix up the two names			1
‘ but there it was “ @entity2 has died , leaving three children and a husband ”			1
’ mrs @entity2 is due to travel to @entity24 from her home in western @entity30 next week			2
old friends : @entity2 ( second from right ) is seen as a 16 - year - old with her former classmates ( l - r ) @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 and @entity72 the separated mother of two said yesterday : ‘ it ’s very sad to think that they mourned me all those years but at least i ’ve got plenty to tell them			1
‘ this whole experience has made me realise just how lucky i have been to be alive all these years and to have crammed so much into my life			0
’ another of mrs @entity2 ’s friends , @entity80 , 66 , said : ‘ in 1980 @entity70 told me there was a report in the newspaper			1
‘ it said that @entity86 was dead which was absolutely awful			0
then i got this call saying she was alive			0
i could barely believe it			0
‘ to see her after all those years , when i thought that she was dead and i had been mourning her , it is just amazing			0
’ she added : ‘ i had always thought of her , particularly on her birthday , and i have missed her terribly			0
‘ to lose all those years is awful but now we ’re going to try to make up for lost time			0
’ the bungled obituary appeared in @entity98 , a @entity24 - based newspaper which has been printed once a week since 1878			1
yesterday the acting editor @entity99 said : ‘ it ’s always unfortunate when any mix - ups occur in a newspaper			2
and it is especially unfortunate when a mix - up remains unresolved for so long			0
‘ but the @entity105 is pleased that it has been able to announce to the world that @entity2 is alive and kicking			1
‘ hopefully she can enjoy reacquainting herself with friends who thought she was no longer alive			2

@entity2 and her family moved away from @entity112 *hometown*
she placed an obituary for her mother in @entity112 newspaper in 1980
the @entity105 printed @entity2 ***'s*** name instead of her mother ***'s***
realised mistake when she contacted old friends from @entity35 ***'s*** *convent*
