improvement : @entity2 headmaster @entity1 says that the extended hours at the school are already having a positive impact one of the worst - performing primary schools in the country has introduced a 45 - hour week for pupils in a bid to transform results			1
pupils at @entity2 stay at school from 7.45am until 6pm - longer than the standard working week			1
under the radical timetable , they enjoy a free programme of after - school activities ranging from horse - riding to cookery , followed by supervised time in which to complete their homework and read			1
in its former incarnation as @entity24 , the @entity22 school was among the bottom 200 performers out of 15,000 primaries nationally and was condemned by inspectors as failing in 2010			1
the new programme was introduced last september as the school became a semi-independent academy sponsored by millionaire businessman @entity31			1
at first parents were horrified by the idea , with 100 signing a petition to block the changes			2
but headmaster @entity36 says the extended school day is already leading to ‘ real improvement ’ in children ’s results just a term after it was introduced			1
@entity42 starts at 8.55am , although pupils are able to attend a free breakfast club from 7.45am			1
the standard school day finishes at 3.30pm but those aged seven to 11 are able to stay on for a free programme of extra-curricular activities in sport , drama or music			1
classes include horse - riding , cookery , cello lessons , first aid , street dance and trips to @entity58 to study rocket engineering			1
at 5pm , youngsters in the final two years of the school - nine to 11 - year - olds in years five and six - spend a further hour completing homework or practising reading under supervision from teaching assistants			1
the extended timetable was introduced with the aim of giving pupils the same opportunities as youngsters from more advantaged backgrounds and those in private schools			0
it was also intended to help working parents by allowing them to collect their children at 6pm instead of 3.30pm			1
the experiment initially proved controversial with parents who were concerned it would rob children of family time and leave them exhausted			0
fun : pupils at the @entity84 take part in a range of extra-curricular activities after school including horse - riding and cookery lessons ( file picture ) a petition opposing the scheme attracted more than 100 signatures and 13 pupils were withdrawn from the school before it became an academy , with some parents openly blaming the shift to a longer school day			1
but mr @entity1 said pupils had embraced the scheme			0
‘ it ’s been really positive			0
the vast majority of the pupils are staying and benefiting from the activities , ’ he said			1
‘ the study time part has been tremendously successful and we ’re seeing real improvement in the pupils ’ attainment			0
‘ it ’s very settled and calm like it ’s been in place forever			0
‘ to start with it felt like a scary adventure , but now it ’s what we do and parents have been very supportive			0
backing : the school is one of a number adopting extended opening hours after the idea was controversially approved by education secretary @entity125 ‘ i would say the confidence change has been almost more marked than the academic			2
‘ the drama and dance has been very productive and given them confidence			0
they ’re more conversational and sociable now			0
’ the extended timetable is being championed by mr @entity31 , an insurance industry executive , who has personally funded the enrichment programme to the tune of £ 50,000 this year , rising to £ 100,000 next			0
explaining the rationale for the scheme , the @entity139 donor lamented a widespread ‘ apartheid ’ between the educational haves and have - nots			2
‘ our vision is to show that no matter how deprived a child ’s background , given a good , broad and structured education there is no reason why they can not emerge from their primary schooling as every bit as capable and alive to the opportunities that life will present to them as those from more privileged backgrounds , ’ he said			0
‘ i am determined to end the apartheid in education that is so commonplace in this country			0
’ @entity24 had been under - performing for several years with a succession of head teachers quickly moving on			2
the school , where significant numbers of pupils qualify for free meals due to low household income , was finally taken off the failing list in november 2011 under the leadership of mr @entity1			1
it became a sponsored academy nearly a year later with a brief to rapidly improve pupil results			0
the school is among growing numbers moving to an extended day after education secretary @entity125 backed the idea last year , to the fury of teaching unions			2
‘ we are all in favour of longer school days , and potentially shorter summer holidays , ’ he said			2
at @entity2 , there is no compulsion on teachers to take part			1
study time at the end of day is staffed by classroom assistants , who are paid extra			0
@entity192 , chief executive of the @entity193 which runs the academy , said the scheme was helping children to ‘ grow in confidence ’ and ‘ stand taller ’			0
initial monitoring of pupils ’ results suggested it was already reaping benefits , she said			0
‘ in the independent sector it costs £ 22,000 - a - year to get this kind of quality education , ’ she added .			2
