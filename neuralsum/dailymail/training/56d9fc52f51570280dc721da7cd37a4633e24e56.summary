@entity5 , 64 , pleaded guilty this month to causing the death of four - year - old @entity7 by dangerous driving despite initially denying the offence			1
@entity7 , from @entity10 , died of a head injury after @entity5 ’s heavy goods vehicle smashed into the back of her mother ’s @entity14 on the @entity16 in november 2011			1
@entity5 ( right ) was jailed for four and a half years after his @entity17 ploughed into the back of a family car killing @entity7 ( left ) , four			1
he had ignored overhead warning signs to slow down on the @entity16 signs leading up to the site of the accident near @entity24 , @entity25 , had reduced the speed limit to 40mph and even 20mph because of slow - moving traffic			1
but @entity5 ’s lorry was later found to have been travelling at its ' limited ' top speed of around 55mph until moments before it came to a halt			1
@entity33 , of @entity34 , @entity35 , judge @entity36 accepted he had led an ' entirely blameless ' life before to the tragedy			2
@entity39 heard @entity5 , a married father - of - four , was of previous good character and had received ' not so much as a speeding conviction ' while working as a lorry driver for 42 years			2
@entity5 , who has eight grandchildren , had also developed a depressive illness since the accident , as well as suffering from a heart condition and caring for his wife			0
during her sentencing remarks , judge @entity49 told @entity5 : ' nothing in your past can possibly have prepared you for finding yourself in the position that you are in today			0
' i have no doubt about your remorse but nothing you can do , and nothing that i can do , can take away the pain that @entity7 ’s family suffer and will continue to suffer for the rest of their lives			1
' seven other people were also injured in the crash between @entity69 and 4 of the southbound @entity16 at 12:25am on november 27 , 2011 - which saw the motorway closed for more than six hours ( file picture ) imposing a five - year driving ban , the judge told @entity5 : ' it was a sustained period of driving for what must have been several minutes , during which you ignored the traffic signs which clearly reduced the advisory speed limit to 40mph and then made that limit mandatory			1
' you also ignored the fact that vehicles ahead were slowing down - the red brake lights described by other drivers			0
' despite all this you maintained a speed limit at the top level available to your vehicle			0
whether asleep or awake you were in your own little world and utterly unaware of what was going on outside your cab			0
' two other members of @entity7 ’s family , including her aunt and eight - year - old sister , suffered serious injuries when the near - stationary @entity14 was ' punted ' into a concrete barrier at about 12.25am			2
@entity7 was sitting in the rearmost near side seat and was sitting on a booster seat			0
the @entity7 family had been driving home to @entity10 after a family member 's 40th birthday party the previous day in @entity105 , @entity106			1
the car , which had slowed down with its hazard lights flashing , was struck despite ' obvious ' overhead gantry signs warning of a problem ahead			2
@entity5 pleaded guilty on the second day of a trial at which he claimed he may have fallen asleep due to obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome , rather than tiredness , in the run - up to the crash			1
@entity7 's family said after the trial at @entity39 ( pictured ) that @entity5 's sentence is ' nothing compared to the sentence which we will face for the rest of our lives ' following the sentencing , @entity7 ’s relatives released a statement on what they said was ' another milestone in this dark chapter of our lives '			1
the statement , released through @entity131 , read : ' we have had to wait and suffer to see justice done for over a year , on top of coming to terms of the loss of our daughter @entity7 under such tragic circumstances			0
' the sentence mr @entity5 has been given is nothing compared to the sentence which we will face for the rest of our lives			1
there will never be a day when we wo n’t remember the warmth and love we received from our daughter and the pain we feel from losing her			0
' the family added that the aborted trial had been ' emotionally and physically draining ' and had forced them to relive the horrific and painful events of november 27 , 2011			2
the statement continued : ' we often ask ourselves how we would act had we killed a four - year - old child as a result of driving dangerously			0
' we can honestly say that we would come forward and take responsibility for our mistake			0
' we would want the family to know how genuinely sorry we were and do everything possible not to cause them any further pain or suffering			0
' it ’s very difficult for us to forgive someone whose actions since that night have demonstrated no genuine remorse or regret and have been designed only to try and escape justice			0
' seven other people were also injured in the crash between @entity69 and 4 of the southbound @entity16 , which saw the motorway closed for more than six hours .			2
