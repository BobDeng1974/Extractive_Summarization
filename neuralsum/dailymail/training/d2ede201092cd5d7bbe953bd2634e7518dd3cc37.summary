the government 's broad programs to collect @entity1 phone records and internet traffic helped disrupt a 2009 plot to bomb the @entity8 subways , a senior @entity1 intelligence official said			1
but the assertion raises as many questions as it answers because court testimony indicated the subway plot investigation began with an email			0
over the past days , @entity15 newspaper and the @entity16 have revealed classified documents showing how the @entity18 sweeps up phone records and @entity21 data in its hunt for terrorists			0
those programs have come under criticism from civil libertarians and some in @entity27 who say they were too broad and collected too much about innocent @entity1			2
busted : @entity8 terror suspect @entity30 , pictured in 2009 , pleaded guilty to plotting to bomb the @entity8 subway system in one of those programs , the @entity18 's collected daily records of millions of phone calls made and received by @entity1 citizens not suspected of any wrongdoing			2
on thursday , rep. @entity38 , @entity39 , who leads the @entity40 , credited that effort with thwarting a terrorism plot			1
but he did not elaborate			0
the senior @entity1 intelligence official who asserted friday that the phone records program together with other technical intercepts thwarted the subway plot would not provide other details			1
the official was not authorized to discuss the plot publicly and requested anonymity			0
@entity50 @entity30 pleaded guilty in the 2009 plot , saying he had been recruited by @entity52 in @entity53			2
safe : the @entity18 's domestic spying program stopped an alleged terror plot planned against the @entity8 subway system the break in that case came , according to court documents and testimony , when @entity30 emailed a @entity63 address seeking help with his bomb recipe			1
at that time , @entity67 intelligence officials knew the @entity63 address was associated with an @entity52 leader in @entity53			1
that 's because , according to @entity67 government documents released in 2010 , officials had discovered it on the computer of a terror suspect there months earlier			2
because the @entity18 and @entity67 intelligence work so closely together and so little is known about how the @entity18 monitors email traffic , it 's possible that both agencies were monitoring the @entity63 address at the time @entity30 sent the critical email in 2009			1
a-ok : there have been no successful terrorist attacks in @entity8 since 9/11 , perhaps in part due to the @entity18 's ' prism @ program what 's unclear , though , is how the phone program aided the investigation , which utilized court - authorized wiretaps of @entity30 and his friends			0
based on what 's known about the phone - records program , the @entity18 might have had an archive of all the phone calls @entity30 had made , which might have helped authorities look for possible co-conspirators			0
because the phone program remains classified , however , it 's impossible to say with certainty how the program benefited the investigation .			0

government program credited by rep. @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 head , with thwarting planned attack
alleged terrorist found out after emailing known @entity52 leader in @entity53 for help making a bomb
