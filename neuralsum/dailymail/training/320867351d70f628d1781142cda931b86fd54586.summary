the unique ceremony is sure to make any @entity2 enthusiast swoon as not a single detail has been missed			2
happily ever after : the photo shoot was created for the online wedding store , @entity40 prince charming : the wedding naturally took place in the sea with a trail of clam shells leading up to it mer - bridesmaids : the colourful bridesmaids wore pastel tulle skirts and shell bra printed t - shirts however , fans should n't be too envious as the somewhat perfect wedding is completely fabricated and was created as part of a photo - shoot			1
@entity17 and @entity24 , who played prince @entity21 in the scenario , are both models and shot the photographs in collaboration with @entity61 , @entity62 and online wedding store , @entity40 in order to showcase their stock			1
despite the fact that the wedding is purely for show , the photographs demonstrate that it is possible for fans to recreate their fantasy wedding in reality			0
inspiration : the theme of the wedding was taken from the 1989 @entity3 film @entity77 where a mermaid , @entity2 ( left ) is transformed into a human in order to be with prince @entity21 ( right ) floundering around : the shoot appeared completely authentic with natural shots taking precedence up where they walk : @entity2 took her human form in the wedding but her outfit obviously took inspiration from the mermaid 's fishtail i want to see them dancing : @entity24 who took the role of prince @entity21 , was dressed casually in a pair of navy chinos and a white shirt with rolled up sleeves not a detail has been missed , from the diamond encrusted anchor ring that adorns her finger to the golden shell around her neck , @entity17 is the spitting image of the @entity3 heroine			1
even @entity24 , looks the part , dressed relatively casually in a crisp white shirt and navy chinos - ensuring that all attention is on the mermaid bride			0
@entity17 's dress has no doubt taken inspiration from @entity2 's fish tail as the hem is dip - dyed with a gradient of different blues			0
@entity3 decor : the wedding decorations also took an ocean theme with the colour scheme featuring mainly turquoise and green hues fairy tale feast : snacks on offer included mermaid macaroons i 've got whosits and whatsits galore : not a single detail appeared to have been missed with @entity17 even wearing a golden shell necklace that @entity131 , the sea witch , famously wore in the film @entity17 is furthermore convincing as she is pictured combing her red hair with a golden fork , mirroring the famous scene in the 1989 film			1
to follow the ceremony which , naturally took place on the shore of the beach , guests could enjoy a selection of ocean themed macaroons and cupcakes			0
to ensure that the guests ' napkins do n't blow away before they can tuck into their crustacean - themed snacks , they are held in place with golden starfish			0
the majority of the detailed props used on the shoot are available to buy at @entity40 so fans can create their dream wedding like never before			2
the only thing that the company ca n't offer is a @entity8 to go with			0
inspiration : although the wedding was n't real it demonstrates to die - hard fans that they can create their dream wedding a seaside spread : table decorations featured aqua sequined table cloths and golden starfish its a dinglehopper ! @entity17 recreated that famous scene in @entity27 where @entity2 uses a fork to comb her long red hair			1
