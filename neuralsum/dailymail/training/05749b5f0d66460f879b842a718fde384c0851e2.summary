by @entity0 published : 18:59 est , 2 february 2013 updated : 08:08 est , 3 february 2013 the world ’s most ambitious initiative to return captive - born animals to the wild began last week when six @entity6 langurs and a gibbon were transported to @entity8 from @entity9			1
it is the first time these primates have been reintroduced into their natural forest habitat in @entity6 to boost the ‘ vulnerable ’ indigenous population			1
the ‘ repatriation ’ is part of @entity16 ’s campaign , back to @entity17			2
as head of the charitable @entity21 , the conservationist wants to end the suffering of wild animals kept in zoos and bolster the population of endangered species			1
the langurs , right , were born at his @entity9 wildlife parks @entity41 and @entity42 , while the gibbon was born in @entity43 before becoming part of the @entity46 breeding programme			1
‘ we launched the initiative because i believe we have an obligation to our animals , ’ said @entity16 , 52			2
‘ i do n’t believe exhibiting wild animals for entertainment is right			1
i think the world has moved on			2
my aim is to change the consciousness of the public			2
’ his foundation has an impressive record			2
there have been births of 139 gorillas , 33 black rhinos , 20 african elephants and 28 @entity6 gibbons at the parks			1
@entity16 says his wish is that one day his two animal parks no longer exist ‘ because there was no need for them any more			0
’ the son of the legendary gambler , @entity71 , @entity16 , 52 , grew up at @entity41 , a @entity74 mansion in @entity9 which was filled with his father ’s pets which included a leopard and a @entity79 bear			0
@entity41 eventually became a wildlife park which @entity16 took control of after his father ’s death , in 2000 , and turned into a leading conservation charity			0
like his father before him , he has a genuine love of wild animals			1
as we talk , a five month old tiger cub , @entity89 , pads around the study			0
unlike his father , however , @entity16 will do everything in his power to make sure his charge eventually lives life in the wild not a cage			1
he said : ‘ we have written to the @entity100 ambassador as we ’re hoping we might be able to introduce our tigers there			0
we have one person whose job it is solely to look for ways and places to reintroduce animals into the wild			1
‘ we launched the initiative because i believe we have an obligation to our animals			0
i do n’t believe that exhibiting wild animals for human entertainment is right			1
i think the world has moved on			0
my aim is to change the consciousness of the public			0
we ’ve grown up in a culture where it ’s normal to take our children to the zoo			0
we ’ve been brought up to believe that it ’s perfectly ok to go and see these animals in captivity for the pleasure of man			0
' conservationist : @entity16 has previously released gorillas back into the wild and more will travel back to @entity34 and @entity35 this year ‘ why do we feel we can sentence these animals to life imprisonment ? and with no pardon			1
for that ’s what we ’re doing and what right do we have to do that ? for me , i ca n’t accept that			0
not if we want to be proud of ourselves as a species			0
under @entity142 law it ’s legal to capture a wild elephant and bring into @entity144			1
how is that acceptable ? people need to demand change , write to their local institutions , their local mps			0
i ’m not naive , it will take time - maybe 20 years - but i hope in time there will be real change			1
’ his foundation has an impressive conservation record - there have been 139 gorilla births , 33 black rhinos ( currently an endangered species ) 20 african elephants , 28 @entity158 and 24 @entity6 langurs			1
their work could save these species from extinction			0
reintroducing the animals to the wild is a long and involved process			2
last week ’s ‘ repatriation ’ has been eight years in the planning - from the initial finding of the land for their reserves in @entity171 and @entity172 to working with the local government to preparing the animals for their journey and , ultimately , the wild			1
journey : rhinos are lifted off a specially enlisted @entity179 757 at @entity180 during their ' repatriation ' trip last year the primates ’ journey began last thursday when they were flown from @entity186 to @entity187 and then onto @entity188			2
they then travelled for five hours on a truck and were then carried for half an hour on bamboo poles , down the mountain to the @entity21 centre in @entity194			0
they will then have to be acclimatised before being released later in the year			0
@entity16 said : ‘ we have to spend some months conditioning the animals although life is so different there ’s only so much you can do			0
they ’ll be introudced to local fruits and local leaves and we ’ll also mix them with wild caught primates who will hopefully teach them the ways of the forest			1
in @entity8 gibbons and langurs are status symbols and are often kept in small cages in people ’s gardens			2
we ’ve been working with the government to rescue them and then , like our primates , we hope to release them back to the wild			1
’ two further langurs , which have been held back as they had worms - all animals must be given a clean bill of health before they are reintroduced to the will			1
they will follow shortly , then it will be the turn of the gorillas , the elephants ... and so many more			0
it is a challenge but one which @entity16 will never give up on while so many species are perilously close to extinction and there are still wild animals in captivity			2
his greatest wish is that his two greatest achievements - @entity41 and @entity240 - no longer exist			2
he said : ‘ yes , because if there was no need for them anymore i would die a happy man			0

six @entity6 langurs and a gibbon transported to their natural habitat
