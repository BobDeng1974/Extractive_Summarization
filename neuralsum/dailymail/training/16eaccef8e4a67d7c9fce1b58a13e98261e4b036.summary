as massive pipes snake through chambers filled with abandoned machinery , it could almost be the set of @entity5 's horror classic @entity6			0
but this is , in fact , @entity12 , known simply as @entity8 - once an iconic site of @entity11 engineering			1
since its closure in 2000 , it has fallen into a state of neglect and is now scheduled for demolition			2
in its place will stand a vast retail distribution depot			1
@entity8 , in @entity22 , @entity23 , was opened after the @entity24 and for more than 50 years was at the forefront of gas turbine and jet engine research , development and testing			1

@entity38 , buttons on a control desk and , right , a gauge for the air house the eerie photos look like they were taken from the set of @entity5 's @entity46 blockbuster , @entity6 , but instead give a glimpse into the demise of @entity11 industry regarded as the biggest facility of its kind in the world , v bomber ( @entity55 , @entity56 and @entity57 ) , @entity58 and tornado engines were all tested at high speeds there			2
in the once state - of - the art site is @entity64 , the largest engine test cell of its kind in the world , which was used to test @entity68 's engines at a staggering 2,000mph and at an atmospheric pressure of 60,000ft			1
the @entity70 used gas turbine engines that were all tested at @entity8 , and during the @entity72 captured @entity74 engines were scrutinised			1
these amazing photos were snapped by graphic designer @entity76 , 41 , from @entity77 , @entity78			0

it dried the compressed air flow being sent to all the major test cells a chamber in engine test cell 4 - the largest of its kind in the world			2
this was used to test @entity68 's engines at a staggering 2,000mph and at an atmospheric pressure of 60,000ft mr @entity76 has visited the site ten times , spending over 75 hours capturing the incredible abandoned site			0
he said : ' standing in these empty and broken places rouses strong emotional responses for me			0
it sounds very clichéd but the past becomes a very tangible thing when surrounded by the ruins of an old industrial plant or a school classroom that has n't seen a taught lesson in years			0
' ' with just a small amount of imagination , you can hear the roar of the turbine hall or picture the rows of eager hands hoping to catch the teacher 's attention			0
' ' in taking pictures in locations such as these , i want to try to capture those emotions within the frame - it 's a very retrospective and indulgent use for photography but one i enjoy immensely			0
' after its closure in 2000 , the facility was left in almost the same condition as it was when operational - huge pieces of industrial equipment and even full jet engines remain gathering dust , rusting into history			1

mr @entity76 feels that the loss of @entity8 marks a significant loss for @entity11 industry			2
he said : ' @entity8 played such a important world - leading role in engine development that it 's hard not to feel a sense of loss when standing inside one of the testing cells there and realising that it 's something that we willingly let go of			1
' ' our industries are disappearing as we become more and more reliant on other nations to lead the way			0
it signals us stepping back on the world stage			0
' as such , exploring @entity8 is like stepping back into a golden era of @entity11 engineering and industrial prowess			2
' engine test cell 3 played its role in the golden era of @entity11 engineering today , @entity8 is the frequent target for urban explorers and is set to be demolished and replaced by a vast retail distribution depot mr @entity76 said : ' @entity8 played such a important world - leading role in engine development that it 's hard not to feel a sense of loss when standing inside one of the testing cells there and realising that it 's something that we willingly let go of ' ' i find it amazing the way in which the various site buildings worked in unison like a town - sized machine - each had a purpose or service they provided to another building , all working together towards the end goal of creating supersonic air flow and atmospheric pressure within the four engine testing cells			1
' it is very sad that such an important part of our country 's industrial heritage is simply going to be broken up and sold off as scrap , but to keep it would be simply be too expensive , particularly in these days of austerity when everything needs to be financially justified			0
' recalling how he had read of the site when it was operational , he added : ' i have read an online account by the child of a staff member that said " when @entity64 came online at night , you could hear a distant low rumble even from several miles away "			0

' today , @entity8 is the frequent target for urban explorers - at least it will be until the base is destroyed			2
demolition work is set to start on the site , renamed @entity272 , soon , according to the @entity274 website			2
more than 12,000 people objected to the scheme , arguing that it would destroy the green ‘ lung ’ between @entity22 and @entity283 and lead to a glut of lorries on the area ’s already over-stretched roads			0
however , the site 's developers said the new depot would create up to 1,600 jobs .			0

@entity8 - known as @entity8 - closed in 2000
@entity8 , in @entity22 , @entity23 , opened after the @entity24
was at forefront of gas turbine and jet engine research , development and testing for over 50 years
also scrutinised @entity74 engines captured during @entity72
now set for demolition , to be replaced with retail distribution depot
