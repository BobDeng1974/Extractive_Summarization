by @entity0 published : 11:44 est , 7 march 2014 updated : 13:37 est , 7 march 2014 action : massachusetts governor @entity3 has signed a bill prohibiting ' upskirt ' photos of women massachusetts governor @entity3 has signed a bill prohibiting ' upskirt ' photos of women just two days after the state 's highest court ruled that taking photos of a woman 's private parts was legal in certain circumstances			1
@entity3 's office said the governor signed the measure today , after the @entity19 controversially overruled a lower court which upheld charges against a man who took cellphone photos up the skirts of female subway passengers in @entity26			1
@entity27 was arrested in august 2010 by transit police who set up a sting after getting reports that he was using his cellphone to take photos and video up female riders ' skirts and dresses			2
on wednesday , the @entity19 ruled that @entity27 did not violate state law because the women were not nude or partially nude , even though they did not consent to the photos			1
the court said that existing so - called ' @entity44 laws ' protect people from being photographed in dressing rooms and bathrooms when nude or partially nude , but the way the law is written , it does not protect clothed people in public areas			1
' a female passenger on a @entity61 trolley who is wearing a skirt , dress , or the like covering these parts of her body is not a person who is " partially nude , " no matter what is or is not underneath the skirt by way of underwear or other clothing , ' the court said in its ruling			2
state law ' does not apply to photographing ( or videotaping or electronically surveilling ) persons who are fully clothed and , in particular , does not reach the type of upskirting that the defendant is charged with attempting to accomplish on the @entity61 , ' the court said			2
however , the ruling immediately prompted top @entity75 lawmakers to pledge to update state law			0
' upskirt ' : now in @entity78 , it would be illegal to take a photo up this woman 's skirt even though she clothed lawmakers yesterday approved legislation to crack down on those who secretly take photographs of ' the sexual or other intimate parts ' of men , women and children in public			1
' it is sexual harassment			0
it 's an assault on another person whether it 's a child or an adult , ' @entity93 president @entity92 said moments after the @entity93 unanimously approved the bill			2
' women and children should be able to go to public places without feeling that they are not protected by the law			2
' the legislation says anyone who ' photographs , videotapes or electronically surveils ' another person 's sexual or intimate parts without that person 's consent would face a misdemeanor charge and a maximum penalty of two - and - a - half years in jail and a $ 5,000 fine			1
the crime becomes a felony with a maximum penalty of five years in prison and a $ 10,000 fine for photographs or recordings of a child under 18			1
@entity44 : @entity27 ( pictured ) was arrested in august 2010 for using his cellphone to take photos up female riders ' skirts and dresses distributing such photos would carry a maximum punishment of 10 years in prison and a $ 10,000 fine			1
@entity133 said those who take such photos sometimes post them on pornographic websites			0
house speaker @entity137 said the @entity138 moved swiftly after the @entity19 issued its ruling on wednesday			0
' not only did we get it done quickly , but i think there was a feeling that we did it right , ' he said			0
' we wanted to make sure that this would be a law that would pass all legal questions that could arise			0
' in the past three years , @entity61 police have investigated 13 ' secretly photographing ' cases			0
in some cases , the alleged offender was issued a court summons			0
some remain open investigations .			0
