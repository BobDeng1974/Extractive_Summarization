a top advisor to @entity1 has accused @entity2 of endorsing the @entity4 president because they are both black - amid new evidence of a widening racial gap in the battle for the @entity9			1
@entity10 said he did not believe @entity2 , the former @entity2 secretary of state under @entity11 , switched parties and endorsed @entity13 because he likes his policies			1
he said : ‘ frankly , when you take a look at @entity2 , you have to wonder whether that ’s an endorsement based on issues or whether he ’s got a slightly different reason for preferring president @entity13			2
the race for the @entity9 has polarised voters along racial lines claim : @entity26 has suggested that @entity2 endorsed @entity13 's presidential campaign because they are both black asked to explain what he meant by @entity30 on @entity31 , he said : ' well , i think when you have somebody of your own race that you ’re proud of being president of the @entity4 , i applaud @entity2 for standing with him			1
' mr @entity10 , a former chief of staff under president @entity11 , later backed away from his racially - charged comment on thursday night			2
but it immediately sparked outrage among @entity40 just hours before a new poll showed a growing black - white divide in @entity4 ’s viciously polarised politics			0
the mixed - race mr @entity13 successfully sold himself in 2008 as a ' post-racial ' president who would bridge @entity4 ’s historic black - white divide			1
but a tracking poll for the @entity48 shows the president is struggling to connect with many of the white voters who supported him four years ago			1
@entity52 : mr @entity2 , a former general , made his endorsement during an interview on @entity55 while mr @entity13 is still supported by the vast majority – some 80 per cent - of black and @entity60 voters , his share of whites has fallen from 43 percent in 2008 to 37 percent this year			1
this puts him 23 points behind mr @entity1 among white voters			0
the survey shows that mr @entity13 ’s dwindling popularity since he was trounced by @entity1 in their first tv debate has been particularly severe among white voters in three categories - men , people without university degrees and those who describe themselves as politically uncommitted			0
that last section is particularly important as both sides are aware that it is @entity4 ’s relatively small number of swing voters who are likely to decide the election			0
attack : @entity78 has criticised mr @entity2 for giving his support to the @entity13 campaign the survey provided additional good news for mr @entity1 , seeing him pull ahead of mr @entity13 overall by 50 percent of the national vote to 47 percent			1
despite the exodus of white voters from the @entity40 , the tracking poll showed that they still distrust mr @entity1			0
forty eight percent of white voters said a @entity1 presidency would do more to help the rich while most of them believe mr @entity13 will do more to assist the middle class			0
mr @entity10 's comments followed an attack on mr @entity2 by former presidential candidate @entity78 who said he has ' harmed his legacy ' by turning away from the @entity95			2
worry : mr @entity13 's support among white voters is flagging , according to a new poll change : mr @entity2 has criticised @entity1 's shifting position on many foreign policy issues a poll by @entity102 also showed mr @entity13 doing badly among white voters in @entity104 , widely seen as the state that mr @entity1 must win if he is to have a chance of taking the @entity9			1
according to the survey , the president is trailing the @entity95 by six per cent among whites in the state even though mr @entity13 rescued a @entity4 car industry that is one of @entity104 ’s main sources of jobs			2
compounding alarm for the @entity40 , there is growing concern that many african - americans have lost enthusiasm for the once - inspirational president and may not turn out on polling day			0
mr @entity2 served in the @entity122 before entering public life as president @entity125 's national security advisor			2
he oversaw the conduct of the @entity127 as @entity128 , and was secretary of state during the invasions of @entity131 and @entity132			0

@entity10 claims mr @entity2 is supporting the president 's election campaign because of their shared race
says the former @entity4 secretary of state - who is @entity141 - did not make *decision* based on policy
poll show race for @entity9 is racially divided with @entity13 supported by 80 **%** of black and @entity60 voters but just 37 **%** of whites
data also shows president is struggling to connect with whites who voted for him four years ago
