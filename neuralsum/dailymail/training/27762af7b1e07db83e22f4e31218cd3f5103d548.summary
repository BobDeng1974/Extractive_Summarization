by @entity0 investigators are interviewing the pilots of the doomed @entity3 in a bid to find out why the aircraft clipped the seawall before slamming into the tarmac at @entity8			1
the @entity9 is halfway through the interviews with the four - member flight crew , but they still have to talk to the pilot who was controlling the plane when it crashed			1
pilot @entity14 , who had just 43 hours ' experience flying a @entity16 777 , was at the controls during the plane 's landing in @entity8 - which was his first time flying the model to the airport			1
@entity23 - ho , from @entity25 's @entity24 , said on tuesday that investigators from both countries quizzed two of the four @entity30 pilots , @entity28 and @entity31 - min , on monday , and they planned to quiz the two others and air controllers on tuesday			1
investigation : @entity35 , the head of the @entity9 , said the @entity9 will interview the pilot at the controls of the doomed @entity30 flight on tuesday @entity9 chairwoman @entity35 added that flight attendants will also be interviewed on tuesday to determine how successful the evacuation process was ; there have been reports one of the escape slides was faulty			1
she said that the process has so far been slowed by language barriers			0
' i am looking forward to having the crew interviews done , ' @entity35 said on monday			0
' it 's going very slowly			0
we want to make sure the crew members are n't confused , that the information that 's being exchanged is clear , that we â€™re getting out of it all the information that we need			0
' although the @entity9 has revealed that the plane was landing too slow and attempted to accelerate too late - tipping the plane upwards and smashing the tail to the ground - @entity35 told @entity59 that it was too early to determine the cause			1
@entity61 : an image taken immediately after the crash shows the @entity16 engulfed in smoke and flames on the tarmac at @entity8 on saturday lucky escape : passengers walk away from the @entity30 aircraft just moments after the crash landing in a photo taken by a passenger			1
investigations into the cause are now underway ' i think it really is too early to conclude pilot error because there 's so much that we do n't know , ' she said			1
' we have to understand what these pilots knew			1
we also need to look at how they were flying the airplane			2
' she added that it was helpful to have the pilots to interview so that investigators could understand what they were thinking and to determine when they realized there was a problem			2
questions include whether all four pilots were in the cockpit , as expected , or just the trainee and his trainer , who were both experienced pilots on other aircrafts			2
but the airline acknowledged on monday that the pilot at the controls had little experience flying that type of plane and was landing one for the first time at that airport			1
officials emphasized that there will not be an interrogation of the pilots			2
data : a graph charting the altitude of flights landing at the airport shows the @entity30 flight dipped below others ' the @entity9 will ask them to tell us in your own words what was going on , ' former @entity9 managing director @entity123 said			2
' the investigators will have some advantage , they 'll have some information from voice recorder			0
but it 's not a cross examination , it 's an effort to understand what the pilot remembers and what he remembers saying and doing			2
' he added that there is a possibility a license could be revoked , or fines or penalties issued			0
@entity3 was 500 feet above ground and about half a minute from @entity8 when its speed dropped below the threshold for a safe landing speed			1
it continued slowing until just about eight seconds before touch down when pilots recognized the need for more speed and throttled up , @entity9 investigations show			2
fallout : @entity30 president and ceo @entity149 , center right , leaves for @entity8 from the @entity152 in @entity153 on tuesday as the interviews with his pilots continue by the time the engines started adding speed , the plane was barely above @entity159 and the plane clipped the seawall at the end of the runway , slammed down and then caught fire			1
miraculously , only two of the 307 people on board died , and most of the survivors suffered little or no injuries			0
more than 120 people walked away without any injuries			0
the @entity173 has criticized the @entity9 for releasing so much information at such an early stage in the probe			0
' the release of individual data points from the flight data recorder and the cockpit voice recorder - without the context of the entire body of factual investigative data - represents a potential detriment to flight safety , ' the group said in a statement			0
' it encourages wild speculation , as we have already seen in the media , about causes of the accident before all the facts are known , before investigators have the ability to determine why the events occurred , and in this case before the flight crew had even been interviewed			1
' victims : 16 - year - old schoolgirls @entity201 , left , and @entity203 , right , pose for photos with other classmates in the classroom in @entity207			0
they were killed in the crash destruction : more than 180 people were injured in the crash but miraculously , 120 were not authorities will also reviewing the initial rescue efforts after fire officials acknowledged that one of their trucks may have run over one of the two @entity219 teenagers killed in the crash			0
the students , @entity203 and @entity201 , were part of a larger group headed for a @entity225 summer camp with dozens of classmates			0
the @entity9 said they are reviewing airport surveillance video to determine whether an emergency vehicle ran over one of students , killing her , but they have not reached any firm conclusions .			0

the pilot who was at the controls when the @entity16 smashed into the tarmac is being interviewed on tuesday
pilot @entity14 had just 43 hours ' experience flying the model of plane and had never landed it at @entity8 before
other pilots , flight attendants and air controllers are also being quizzed
