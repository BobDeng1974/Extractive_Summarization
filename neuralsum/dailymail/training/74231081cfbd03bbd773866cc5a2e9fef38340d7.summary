they have become the rallying cry for @entity3 protesters across the world			1
but the words , ' hands up , do n't shoot ! ' , may never actually have been said by @entity6 , according to witness accounts contained in thousands of grand jury documents			1
similarly , the unarmed black 18 - year - old 's hands might not have been raised in the air when he was shot dead by white officer @entity12 in the @entity14 , @entity15 , suburb on august 9			1
the accounts , released by prosecutors earlier this week and reviewed by the @entity18 , feature a number of variations as to the position of @entity6 's hands at the time of the fatal shooting			1
but the words , ' hands up , do n't shoot ! ' , may never actually have been said by @entity6 , according to newly - seen witness accounts shooting : similarly , the unarmed black 18 - year - old 's ( right ) hands might not have been raised in the air when he was shot dead by white officer @entity12 ( left ) in the @entity14 , @entity15 , suburb of @entity3 on august 9 while some witnesses claim he knelt on the ground , raised his hands and shouted , ' do n't shoot ! ' , before he was gunned down by @entity12 , others insist he was stood up with his arms by his sides			1
for those who believe his hands were raised , some think they were pointed toward the sky , others claim were partially raised and several believe his palms appeared out , as if he was surrendering			2
and to a number , @entity6 's palms seemed open , as if he was glancing at his wounded hand or gesturing with an attitude of ' what are you going to do about it ? ' the contradictory accounts arguably undermine the ' hands up , do n't shoot ! ' cry , now a national symbol of racial inequality for those who believe overzealous police target minorities too often			1
however , some argue it does not matter whether @entity6 's hands were literally raised in the air - nor whether he yelled , ' hands up , do n't shoot ! ' - because his death symbolizes a bigger movement			1
' this is not about one boy getting shot in the street , but about the hundreds just like him who have received the same callous and racially - influenced treatment , ' protester , @entity72 , a middle school teacher from @entity73 , @entity74 , said			1
chanting : the accounts feature a number of variations as to the position of @entity6 's hands at the time of the shooting			1
above , protesters chant , ' hands up , do n't shoot ' outside @entity86 's @entity85 demonstrating : a female protester places her head through a hole in a poster showing a pair of raised hands ' so ultimately , no , it does nâ€™t matter at all if somehow we can say for sure whether this one young man really said these words or had his hands up			1
' demonstrator @entity98 , 28 , a food server , also from @entity73 , added : ' he was n't shot because of the placement of his hands ; he was shot because he was a big , black , scary man			0
' following the announcement of the grand jury 's decision not to indict @entity12 in the case on monday , protesters have been taking to the streets of more than 170 @entity108 cities in demonstration			2
@entity6 knelt on the ground , raised his hands and shouted , ' do n't shoot ! ' , before he was gunned down by @entity12			1
the unarmed 18 - year - old 's hands were pointed toward the sky 3			1
his hands were only partially raised 4			0
@entity6 's palms appeared out , as if he was surrendering to @entity12 5			1
his palms seemed open , as if he was glancing at his wounded hand or gesturing with an attitude of ' what are you going to do about it ? ' 6			0
@entity6 was stood up with his arms by his sides - not raised - when he was shot dead every night so far , thousands of people - from @entity124 to @entity125 to @entity126 - have raised their arms in the air and chanted : ' hands up , do n't shoot ! ' some have carried hand - made banners featuring the same words , others have held posters reading : ' @entity135 lives matter ' and hundreds have accused the police of ' brutality '			1
the shooting has had particular resonance in @entity126 , which was rocked by days of rioting after the 2011 death of @entity144 , a young black man shot dead by police under disputed circumstances			0
meanwhile , in @entity3 , some protesters have even been donning shirts printed with the phrase , ' hands up , do n't shoot ! ' , as they demonstrate outside the suburb 's police station			1
the truth behind the words may never be certain			0
despite a state investigation and an ongoing federal probe , no one has publicly disclosed any photos or videos of exactly what transpired			0
protester @entity161 , a 32 - year - old white man from nearby @entity162 , said that while he believes there is truth to the claims that @entity6 had his hands raised when shot , the lack of proof makes little difference to demonstrators who have found it to be a unifying force			1
' even if you do n't find that it 's true , it 's a valid rallying cry , ' he said			1
' it 's just a metaphor			0
' meanwhile , architect @entity179 , who was this week protesting in @entity180 , claimed the ' hands up ' gesture is far from a literal representation of the circumstances of @entity6 's death			2
incident : @entity6 had been walking with a friend down the center of @entity189 when @entity12 , passing in his patrol vehicle , told them to move to the sidewalk			2
the pair then had a scuffle at @entity12 's car ( pictured ) broken glass : in subsequent seconds , @entity12 fired a shot that hit @entity6 in the right hand			1
when the teen ran , @entity12 gave chase , before later opening fire			0
above , broken glass from @entity12 's patrol car window weapon : this gun , used to kill @entity6 , was also released as part of the dump of grand jury evidence ' my sense is that it 's totally symbolic and a way of representing powerlessness ' in the face of inequality and militarized police , he said			1
@entity6 had been walking with a friend down the center of @entity189 on august 9 when @entity12 , passing in his patrol vehicle , told them to move to the sidewalk			2
after they refused to do so , @entity12 reportedly realized @entity6 was a robbery suspect , at which point a scuffle broke out at the window of his vehicle			2
in subsequent seconds , @entity12 fired a shot that hit @entity6 in the right hand			2
when the teenager ran , @entity12 gave chase			0
at some point , @entity6 stopped and turned toward @entity12 , who opened fire			2
@entity12 told the grand jury that @entity6 had his left hand in a fist at his side and his right hand under his shirt at his waist , and was charging toward him , when he gunned him down			0
' if only @entity108 cared about black lives ' : protesters @entity244 , ( left ) of @entity245 and @entity246 , ( right ) , of @entity247 , listen to a speech before demonstrating in the @entity249 on @entity250 some of the witness accounts of the high - profile shooting differed so much that they did not seem like the same scene			1
above , protesters lie outside a @entity3 mall on saturday in protest at the grand jury 's verdict in the grand jury documents , the phrase ' hands up ' is peppered as prosecutors and investigators desperately tried to clarify exactly what witnesses saw			2
in quite a few cases , it is unclear precisely what onlookers say they saw because the gestures they made for grand jurors were not described in the transcripts			0
alarmingly , some of the witness accounts of the high - profile shooting differed so much that they did not seem like the same scene			2
' i saw him in the middle of the street on his knees with hands up , ' one witness said			0
' [ the ] officer came up to him and shot him in his head and he fell			0
' but another witness was insistent that @entity6 was on his feet at the time and did not raise his hands			0
' the officer was already in pursuit of him , ' they said			0
he did turn , he did some sort of body gesture , i 'm not sure what it was , but i know it was a body gesture			0
' and i could say for sure he never put his hands up after he did his body gesture , he ran towards the officer full charge			0
' according to experts , the disputed circumstances of @entity6 's death highlight the inherent troubles with the use of eyewitness testimony in court			0
' it 's difficult for people under the best of circumstances to accurately report what happened , ' said @entity310 , a psychology professor specializing in race at @entity312 in @entity125			0
for @entity12 and others at the shooting scene , what they say they saw may depend not just on their vantage point , but also their view of life , she said			0
' the truth always really matters , but it 's important to recognize that past experience to stereotypes also influences the perception of hands being raised , ' she said .			0

' hands up , do n't shoot ! ' has become rallying cry for @entity3 protesters
but words may not have been said by unarmed @entity6 , testimonies show
witness accounts also *greatly* differ as to position of 18 - year - old 's hands
some claim they were held high or partially in air , others say they were not
several say his palms were out as if surrendering to officer @entity12
despite contradictions , many argue cry is symbolic of a bigger movement
' this is not about one boy getting shot in the street , but about the hundreds just like him who have received the same callous treatment , ' protester said
