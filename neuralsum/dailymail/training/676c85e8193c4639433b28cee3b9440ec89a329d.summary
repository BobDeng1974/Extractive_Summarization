by @entity0 last updated at 9:31 pm on 29th june 2011 @entity1 : some @entity2 are not performing cataract operations on sufferers if they do n't consider their vision has deteriorated enough drastic restrictions on eye operations imposed by half of @entity2 trusts have put thousands of patients at risk of losing their sight , a report warns			1
elderly victims of the cutbacks are being left unable to read , write or drive as they wait longer for cataract surgery , it says			1
patients in their early - 60s have been denied operations even though their job relies on them being able to drive or operate machinery , eye specialists add			1
the damning report reveals the scandal of @entity26 picking surgery for a cataract – a clouding of the eye lens – as an ‘ easy target ’ to save money by increasing the threshold for vision loss before patients can have an operation , and also by increasing waiting times			1
in some areas , ‘ arbitrary ’ restrictions mean they can have only one eye operated on			0
some @entity26 have suspended surgery for weeks at a time to claw back overspending at the end of a financial year , it is claimed			2
official guidance from the @entity46 states patients should have surgery if the cataract affects sight , has an impact on quality of life , and if he or she understands the risks and agrees to it			1
but the report for the @entity58 of ophthalmologists and the @entity60 insists this is not happening routinely and many @entity26 are implementing ‘ visual acuity ’ thresholds			0
the research is based on @entity66 request results from 133 @entity26 in @entity67			0
of these , 70 @entity26 ( 53 per cent ) are restricting access and have implemented the threshold for surgery on either the first or second eye			2
meanwhile , 56 @entity26 ( 42 per cent ) allow surgery according to the guidelines or if clinicians deem it appropriate			2
in a further seven @entity26 ( 5 per cent ) , the policy is under review or an updated one is being worked on			0
experts believe trusts restricting access are doing so without ‘ robust evidence ’ that this will not harm patients or increase inequalities			0
@entity84 , 69 , had a cataract removed in march but was told he can not have his second eye done due to ‘ @entity26 policy ’			2
the singer , songwriter and poet from @entity91 said : ‘ this is impairing my independence			0
i feel frustrated and abandoned			0
’ @entity94 , of the @entity60 and author of the report , said the data suggested @entity26 had picked on cataract operations as an ‘ easy target ’ where patients could be made to wait longer without harm			1
‘ cataract surgery should be performed when consultants believe it is in the patients ’ best interest , ’ she said			1
‘ but some @entity26 are forcing patients to live with unnecessary sight loss and a reduced quality of life			0
’ @entity111 , chairman of the @entity58 of @entity59 ’ cataract guideline committee , described the cutbacks as ‘ a false economy ’ , adding : ‘ this short - term saving could lead to older people having other accidents , potentially increasing @entity2 costs in the longer term			1
’ a @entity46 spokesman said : ‘ @entity26 should ensure that in each case the clinical needs of each patient are taken into account and should not be introducing blanket bans on access to treatment			0
’ a cataract operation costs the @entity2 £ 932 for the first eye and £ 808 for the second			1
it is the most common surgical procedure in the @entity132 , with 400,000 carried out each year .			0

cataract surgery seen as ' easy target ' for @entity2 cost - cutters
fears move will leave elderly *vulnerable* to accidents
