@entity0 threw away a two - goal lead against @entity2 thanks to individual errors by @entity4 and @entity5 , which leaves them just two points ahead of @entity9 at the top of @entity11			1
it was a cruel twist of fate for @entity4 and @entity5 , both of whom have been outstanding in the second half of the season and the effort on @entity2 's part was momentous			2
a year ago @entity0 travelled to @entity20 to face @entity21 and left a beaten side , their title challenge hitting an iceberg			2
this was not as brutal a blow , but @entity28 ’s team will need to right themselves quickly ahead of a testing fortnight			0
@entity30 ( left ) celebrates scoring the opening goal with @entity32 @entity2 : @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 ( @entity41 70 ) , @entity42 , @entity43 ( @entity44 75 ) , @entity45 ( @entity46 70 )			1

goals from @entity30 and @entity32 looked to have ended @entity2 ’s amazing 14 - month unbeaten home record in @entity11 , but @entity74 ’s men showed why they are so hard to beat with a momentous comeback			1
@entity76 was dropped from @entity2 's squad and @entity78 started on the bench			2
to be able to leave out two @entity0 loanees shows the strength in depth that the coach has			2
it also shows how @entity2 won the @entity85 last season and why they are aiming to reach the @entity87 this year			2
a big part of their @entity91 triumph last season was down to their captain @entity58			0
enough , in fact , that @entity0 decided to pluck him from @entity74 's ranks and give him a bigger stage to shine on			2
@entity58 says he still holds @entity2 in his heart , thanks to his four season spell in @entity20			2
perhaps his history confused him early on , with the @entity103 playing a terrible ball back towards his own box which did n’t cost @entity0 , thanks to the referee deciding he was fouled after releasing it			1
@entity30 curled home a trademark left - footed shot against @entity2 @entity9 had already done their part on saturday afternoon , seeing off @entity113 at the @entity114 and then desperately hoped @entity2 would be able to do theirs			1
something had to give at the @entity116 , whether it was @entity2 's streak , or @entity0 's nine - game winning run			1
it was @entity0 who last did the damage here in february 2014 , but they could not do it again			2
@entity123 , @entity69 and @entity32 were brought back into the @entity0 side after missing wednesday 's win against @entity126 , through injury , suspension and rotation respectively			1
the latter had a point to prove after a run of fruitless games , where he ’s been more likely to cause a fight than score a goal			0
that was n’t the case here			0
@entity32 hit a beautifully struck free - kick from the left , to double @entity0 ’s lead after half - an - hour			1
@entity30 had opened the scoring , with a goal similar to his strike in mid-week			1
@entity32 fed the ball into the @entity147 on the right - hand side of the box , who took a touch to work some space and then curled the ball sweetly around the outstretched arm of @entity33 and into the top left corner			1
the @entity147 forward took his season 's tally to 34 goals in @entity11 @entity2 are good opponents for @entity30 , who has scored more goals against them than any other side , bar @entity163			1
and it was @entity2 he hit a hat - trick against at the @entity168 earlier this season , the game where he overtook @entity172 ’s all - time record of 251 goals			1
when the big games have come around this season , @entity0 have brought their big game			2
@entity54 , for example , has not had a good season , but when the chips are down he ’s dug deep			0
this could be the last time he plays against @entity2 , his former side , and he evoked memories of his former self , charging up the right but getting back when needed as well			2
however , @entity2 got themselves back in the game before the break with a long - range drive from @entity39 , the @entity147 midfielder who has been reinvigorated under @entity74 ’s watchful eye			1
@entity189 doubled @entity0 's lead with a curling free kick into the top corner on a day of goalkeeping errors in @entity194 you suspected it would be third - choice @entity2 stopper @entity33 adding to the list , rather than @entity0 ’s @entity4 , but that was not the case			1
the latter is on course to beat @entity202 ’ @entity203 winning 20 clean sheets from last season , with 17 so far , but could not add to his tally here			0
@entity4 got a hand to @entity39 ’s strike but only succeeded in tipping it in off the post , rather than around it			0
@entity0 had chances to extend their lead , with @entity30 seeing a free kick tipped over , and @entity215 culpable of missing two huge opportunities			1
he blazed both over the crossbar , either side of the half - time interval			0
the first he was off - balance for and the angle was tricky , but the second was a golden chance			0
@entity59 saw his shot saved by @entity224 , but @entity51 could n’t find the empty net with the rebound			0
but the @entity228 side were n’t creating chances at will ; this was hard work against durable , cunning opponents			0
@entity38 made a quite phenomenal tackle on @entity30 which typified the sprit @entity2 showed both in this encounter and throughout the season			1
with the no 10 running at @entity2 's defence , the @entity237 fought back , eventually committing himself to a sliding challenge , from which he emerged with the ball , and started a break			2
@entity215 ( left ) shoots past @entity2 midfielder @entity35 @entity245 – @entity247 , @entity30 and @entity32 aside , @entity11 ’s most proflific forward this season – went close when he whistled a strike over the top of @entity4 ’s goal , while @entity5 and @entity69 were both booked for stopping lightning - quick attacks			1
@entity74 undid @entity0 with three substitutions , all of which paid dividends			0
@entity46 played a big part in the equaliser , which was converted by another substitute , @entity44			0
@entity5 gave the ball away and @entity46 combined with @entity45 , before @entity264 side - footed home a low , scuttled cross at the far post , to ignite the stadium			0
what makes things worse for @entity0 is that this game is just the start of a brutal fortnight			0
@entity28 ’s side travel to @entity272 to play @entity273 on wednesday , before hosting high - flying @entity274 on saturday			0
then it ’s @entity273 again three days later , before a @entity228 derby at @entity277			0
by that time , they may even be playing catch - up			0
one crumb of comfort for @entity282			0
@entity9 still have to come to the @entity116 and to a man , @entity0 ’s side will testify to the difficulty of emerging with three points			1
@entity32 is challenged by @entity2 's @entity38 ( right ) and @entity287 @entity30 , right , skips past the challenge of @entity2 's @entity38			1

@entity0 squandered a two - goal lead to stumble to a draw at @entity2
@entity30 and @entity32 both scored *stunning* goals on saturday night
@entity2 hit back with goals from @entity39 and sub @entity44
@entity11 leaders @entity0 now two points ahead of rivals @entity9
