women across the country took off their tops and exercised their right to bare breasts yesterday			1
some two dozen women took to the streets of @entity7 wearing shoes , shorts , and not much more			1
elsewhere in the country , scantily - clad participants had posters and pamphlets			2
the revealing events were part of what participants called ‘ @entity18 , ’ to draw attention to inequality in topless rights between men and women			1
there were topless men in the park , too , but nobody paid them much attention , a disparity , organizers said , that demonstrated the need for the event			0
the topless women drew crowds of onlookers who took pictures and video with their cell phones			2
' we say there is nothing wrong with the female nipple , ' @entity33 , an organizer of the event , told the crowd that quickly formed around her in @entity73 's @entity72			0
she was wearing white pants and a purse over her shoulder			0
' my dog has six , i have two , but i can be put in jail for showing my nipples			0
it 's 2012 – what are we thinking ? ' equality : in @entity86 , @entity87 , participants took to the surf to protest , wearing bikini bottoms , but leaving the tops behind top free : protesters turn out to take part in the 5th @entity94 in @entity86 , @entity87 gawkers : men of all ages at the @entity86 protest took the opportunity to capture the moment on cell phones and cameras it is legal for women to go topless in public in @entity7 but laws vary widely across the @entity51			1
@entity107 and her colleagues say discrimination is unconstitutional and they want full equality			0
' i 'll show these to a few friends and then delete them after a few days , ' @entity112 , a @entity7 who happened to visit the park on sunday , told @entity116 as he thumbed through photographs and video he had just taken on his phone			1
' several women waved signs saying : ' @entity123			2
' after the speeches , a guitarist led the crowd in a reworking of @entity129 ' song ' @entity130			0
' similar protests were scheduled in about 30 @entity51 cities and 10 around the world , organizers said.in @entity135 , another two dozen men and women marched down @entity138 to promote their rights			1
disappointing : about a dozen women bared their breasts in @entity142 , @entity143 this year , dozens less than the year before organiser @entity146 , 27 , told the @entity148 that the demonstration ‘ can bring us closer to gender equality by showing that they are not objects , they are part of us that we are not ashamed of			1
’ though dozens more in the @entity154 capital looked on , @entity146 said that was a large part of the problem , saying : ‘ gawkers … should be walking with us			0
’ in the march was a self - described ‘ stay - at - home grandma ’ who said : ‘ if there were more opportunities to be naked , i ’d be part of it			0
’ in @entity142 , @entity143 , there were hundreds of gawkers , but only a dozen or so participants			1
the disappointing turn - out could have been in part by a @entity171 public statement that asked for residents and gawkers alike to avoid the rally			0
@entity176 pride : a woman in fairy wings protested in @entity179 , @entity176 @entity181 angels : the women in @entity179 showed up in all white strength in numbers : in @entity186 , men wore bikini tops while the women went bare - chested police said about 2,000 people turned up to watch or show their solidarity with the cause , according to the @entity193			2
the annual @entity18 was established in 2007 by a former sports car journalist called @entity195 , who founded a religion called the @entity197 after he said he was visited by a space alien in a @entity200 volcano park who told him life on @entity181 was created by extra-terrestrial scientists , according to an account on his website			2
