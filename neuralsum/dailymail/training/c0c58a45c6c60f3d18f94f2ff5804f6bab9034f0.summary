after @entity1 knocked them down in his @entity36 pickup , he drove off , leaving the younger boy to die at the scene			2
police later found @entity1 's truck and tied it to the crime , and he was charged three days later			0
he was initially charged with second - degree murder and assault , but prosecutors said there were problems building a case against him because one witness refused to testify and another had edibility problems because of a criminal history , the @entity44 reported			1
