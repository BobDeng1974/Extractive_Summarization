@entity5 played mean boss @entity6 in @entity7 ( pictured ) they may lack the competitive streak of their male colleagues but women are loath to work together			0
a study found two women are less likely to co-operate than two men when one is more powerful than the other			1
similarly , two females of different rank are less likely to work together than a man and a woman			2
the finding contradicts the widely held belief that women ’s nurturing nature makes it natural for them to help each other out , while men are too competitive to have time for each other			2
researchers said that men may be wired to put their differences aside in order to form alliances			0
women , however , are most comfortable with people who are on the same level as them			0
@entity37 , of the @entity38 at @entity39 , said : ‘ the question we wanted to examine was : do men or women co-operate better with members of their own sex ? ‘ the conventional wisdom is that women co-operate more easily but when you look at how armies or sports teams function , there is evidence that men are better at co-operating in some ways			1
’ to look at whether there sexes differ in how they co-operate , the scientists looked at research collaborations in 50 university psychology departments			1
this showed that all female pairings of junior and senior researchers were much less common than collaborations between two men at different stages in their career			1
however , women of the same rank did n’t seem to have difficulty in working together and mixed - sex collaborations were also common			1
in other words , the problem arises in situations in which one female is more powerful than the other			0
writing in the journal @entity79 , the researchers said the lack of trust may come from both directions			0
@entity84 researchers said that men may be wired to put their differences aside in order to form alliances			0
women , however , are most comfortable with people who are on the same level as them			0
consequently they believe many women prefer to work with a male boss ( pictured ) working for a difficult boss can come with stress , long hours and a poor office atmosphere			2
recent research has found it can also be bad for your health			2
the stress of working for a bad boss over a long period of time can cause serious harm to employees , the study found			1
scientists at @entity108 found that chronic stress causes changes in the gene activity in immune cells			0
these changes cause the cells to be primed to fight an infection that does n't exist			0
this leads to inflammation in the body which is associated with many health problems , including heart disease and diabetes			0
they said : ‘ the study does not demonstrate whether the reduced level of co-operation among women if different status is due to higher - ranked or lower - ranked women			1
‘ however , our findings are consistent with results from early childhood onwards suggesting that females of lower status can be uncomfortable co-operating with their superiors			1
‘ female superiors may also be less willing than male superiors to invest in lower - ranked same - sex individuals			1
’ others say that while men make their feelings clear , women are more likely to let jealousies and resentments fester			2
@entity143 researcher @entity142 , one of the study ’s authors , said that women ’s instinctive distrust of females in power may make it more difficult for them to scale the career ladder			1
she said : ‘ females are less likely than males to co-operate across ranks with same - sex individuals			1
‘ this means that a highly talented newcomer female in any organisation does not receive the support that her male counterpart does from higher - ranked individuals who can help them climb the hierarchy			0
’ even having a male boss may not be a huge help			0
professor @entity142 said : ‘ because men often discriminate against women , it is unclear whether higher - ranked males could be more helpful			2

@entity38 study found that two women are less likely to co-operate than two men , when one is more powerful than the other
women of the same rank did n’t seem to have difficulty in working together and mixed - sex collaborations were also common in the research
the findings are consistent with results other studies suggesting females of lower status can be uncomfortable co-operating with their superiors
