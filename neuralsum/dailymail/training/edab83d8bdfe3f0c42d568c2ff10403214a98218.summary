and shh ... - a luxury , no - boys - allowed haven held in a secret @entity25 location - is @entity29 's first such sensuality retreat , launched by long - time friends @entity31 and @entity32 , both 39 , who created their own retreat after both being left somewhat ' dismantled ' by experiences with the @entity36 of psychoanalysis			1
@entity40 ... , an all - female sensuality retreat held in a secret @entity25 location , is , according to founders , about ' celebrating and connecting with our femininity to live to our full potential ' described in the @entity45 by @entity46 , who experienced the retreat , as ' @entity48 meets @entity49 meets rebranded new age ' , shh ... is described by @entity51 herself as ' a fresher , more sophisticated way of thinking about sensuality '			1
by taking part in a range of therapies including sensual healing , transformational breathing , reiki , massage , somatic experiencing , acupuncture , @entity64 , @entity65 and relationship and sex counseling , guests are taught how to build confidence , release anxiety , overcome trauma and explore their unique sensual potential			1
the retreats - which cater for eight women at a time with eight therapists creating a completely bespoke experience for each - are based on three principles : sensuality : unlocking our sensuality by connecting with and nurturing all of our senses through a guided physical and emotional journey			2
healing : using therapeutic bodywork based therapy to help connect with our own innate healing capacity			2
@entity87 : celebrating and connecting with our femininity to live to our full potential			0
using a range of therapies guests are taught how to build confidence , release anxiety , overcome trauma and explore their unique sensual potential speaking about their project , @entity32 and @entity51 say : ' we want to shift the taboo around women 's sensuality and sexual awareness			1
' @entity102 retreats offer women the chance to experience , appreciate and celebrate their femininity through developing an understanding of the relationship between sensuality and self - confidence , creativity and the affects this has on living a full and rich life			0
' we combined our experience , passion , skills and beliefs and have set ourselves a mission to organise unique experiences in the form of retreats and events to harness the collective power of women , and drive a new paradigm in the perception of sensuality and the language associated with it			0
' the team call shh ... - which stands for ' sensual , healing harmony ' - ' the 2014 destination for women looking to improve their sensuality and for those seeking a fuller , healthier and sexier life ' , explaining that the retreat offers ' unique , private , intensive retreats for women , hosted by a team of female expert practitioners and guides '			1
' @entity40 is the 2014 destination for women looking to improve their sensuality and for those seeking a fuller , healthier and sexier life ' @entity32 - a former international swimmer , personal trainer and @entity147 's tv presenter - and @entity31 - a media director with 17 years in the publishing industry - joined forces on their current project having been inspired by each other 's personal story			1
founded in 1967 , @entity153 is a residential course designed to unlock negative energies and leave you better equipped to deal with life 's difficulties			2
created by health professionals , therapists , educational advisors , spiritual healers and others from the human potential movement , it is based on a variety of established teachings , from psychodynamic to cognitive			0
retreats includes counselling workshops and various types of therapy to help people overcome stress and depression			0
@entity32 was one of the @entity29 's leading fitness experts until she was diagnosed with me in 2011			1
then , combining her knowledge of sports science with her experience of traditional therapies , she developed a personal programme to manage the side affects of @entity184 , which had sensual healing at its core			1
@entity187 herself turned to sensual healing as a way of overcoming childhood sexual abuse and a motorbike accident in 2011 which damaged her pelvic organ nerve endings			1
she noticed profound improvements in her health and well - being , and quickly set out to research how sensual healing experienced with other therapies can improve health			1
the two women decided to launch their own retreats , the next of which will take place in march 2014 , based on the proven principle that ' bodywork and alternative therapies can have a profound affect on removing the emotional scars of trauma '			2
they say : ' trauma can come in many forms ; depressions , abandonment , infidelity , childhood bulling , sexual / physical / emotional and mental abuse , bereavement and many more			0
' the body acts as a host for emotional and physical wounds ; these scars play a significant part on our inability to remove emotional and physical blockages			0
' on shh ... retreats we work closely with the body to identify and release the trauma that often - unknowingly affects us daily ; be it in our self - confidence , our relationships , our work and or self - perception			1
' these female - only residential getaways involve working with a range of trained therapists - including sexologists - to feel better about all aspects of your life , including your sex life ' it 's not just about sex , by any means , ' retreat spokesman @entity242 told @entity246			2
' it 's a really cutting edge combination of therapies used to heighten your senses and sexuality			2
' it 's about learning to live with all your senses and come to terms with them and heighten them			0
' we work with each woman to see what they want and need			0
all therapists work together so you get a very bespoke retreat , and although you work as a group all treatments are unique to you			0
' there 's also a three - month aftercare program supporting you on your journey back to real life			0
' i think there will eventually be couples retreats further down the line , but right now it 's designed by solely women for women			0
