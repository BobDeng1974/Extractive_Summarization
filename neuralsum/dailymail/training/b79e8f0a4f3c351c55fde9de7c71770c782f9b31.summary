thieves broke into the secure storage area at @entity8 ’s @entity7 and made off with the valuable pieces			1
experts fear the items , which have been in museum ’s collection for 50 years , may have been taken by an organised crime gang who plan to sell them on the black market			1
@entity18 horns and elephant tusks can fetch tens of thousands of pounds in some @entity21 countries , where they are used as ingredients for traditional medicines and , in some cases , aphrodisiacs			1
three rhino horns were stolen from a @entity8 museum			1
some @entity21 countries believe crushed horn has healing properties and use it to make traditional medicines ( file picture ) the rhino horns were stolen from a secure storage area at the @entity7 in @entity8 ( pictured ) the theft comes as a spate of similar crimes have been reported across @entity39			1
last year @entity39 police agency @entity40 have warned that crime gangs were targeting museums , particularly those in smaller towns and cities , specifically for rhino horns			1
museum staff are unsure about when the horns were taken , but the theft is believed to have happened in the past few months			2
@entity49 was informed of the theft in september , when staff were sure the horns , which were kept in a storage area , had been stolen and not simply mislaid			2
officers have now launched an investigation into the incident and recently arrested a 57 - year - old man on suspicion of the theft			0
he has been released on police bail while officers continue their investigation			0
@entity62 , which runs the museum , said it had improved security since the incident came to light			0
the items have not been on public display for many years because of the authority ’s opposition to the trade in endangered species ’ body parts			2
a city council spokesman said : ' we can confirm that three rhino horns went missing from the museum stores in september			1
@entity18 horns can fetch tens of thousands of pounds when sold on the black market ( file picture ) @entity18 horn is made of keratin , which people in some @entity21 countries believe has healing properties			1
traditional healers in @entity88 and @entity89 use it in a range of remedies , including cancer treatments and hangover cures			2
but doctors in the @entity4 say rhino horn has no medicinal properties			0
according to environmentalists say that in the past five years , growing incomes in the @entity100 have meant more people can get access to crushed horn , despite the £ 35,000 - per - kilo price tag			0
this has resulted in the number of rhinos being poached for their horns soaring			0
' the practice of hunting rhinos for their horns has decimated the population of several species and the horns would never have been exhibited			0
' but they have been in our possession for more than 50 years and we were very disappointed that they had been stolen			0
' since discovering the theft we have had a complete review of security and access to our stores , and implemented new and more stringent procedures			0
' dr @entity123 , of the @entity124 at the @entity125 , said : “ @entity18 horns and , indeed , elephant tusks , are extremely valuable in @entity21 , where they are ground up and sold as medicine or aphrodisiacs			1
' there has been a spate of these thefts across the country in recent years and these items can be sold for tens of thousands of pounds			0
' so , the @entity7 is certainly not the first victim , but what is unusual here is that these items appear to have been stolen from an area which was n’t easily accessible to the public			2
' a report by @entity40 last year highlighted the theft of rhino horns as a growing problem in the @entity4			1
the report said : ' the theft of rhino horn shows how organised criminals are always on the look - out for new and creative crime opportunities			1
' the attraction towards rhino horn clearly stems from the high value of this rare commodity			0
' depending on the size and quality of the specimen , a rhino horn can be worth between 25,000 and 200,000 euros			0
' @entity18 horns are used for decoration , to produce luxury products and also used in traditional medicine , despite it being proven ineffective			1
the report highlighted one @entity167 gang ’s methods			0
it said : ' to source and acquire rhino horns , the group has targeted antique dealers , auction houses , art galleries , museums , private collections and zoos , resorting to theft and aggravated burglary where necessary ' to sell specimens , they have exploited international auction houses in the @entity4 , @entity181 , @entity182 and @entity89			2
