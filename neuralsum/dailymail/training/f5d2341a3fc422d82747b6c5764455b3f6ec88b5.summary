by @entity0 for @entity1 a heavily tattooed @entity3 man whose face is embellished with hundreds of piercings and two horn implants was refused entry to @entity8 - because officials thought he was a practitioner of black magic			1
@entity11 , 55 , who holds the @entity12 for having the most piercings , was travelling to @entity8 for the first time last week to appear at a circus - themed venue alongside sword swallowers and burlesque dancers			1
but he says he was barred from entering the conservative @entity19 city by @entity21 officials who were concerned he practised the dark arts			1
but his appearance apparently put the wind up @entity8 airport officials who barred him entry as they thought practised the dark arts mr @entity11 , who has 453 piercings , 278 of which are around his genitalia , had his passport stamped and approved at the airport , but was stopped before entering customs			1
he later tweeted : ' the immigration thought i am black magic			1
' [ sic ] and conceded that his appearance may have had something to do with it			2
' i have two horns			2
i think that was also a problem for me in @entity8 , ' he said			0
as a result , the it expert 's scheduled appearance at the @entity46 nightclub in @entity8 's @entity47 on friday was cancelled			0
the club opened in 2011 and promises a little bit of everything : ' stilt walkers , midgets , contortionists , tattooed dancers , jugglers , drummers ... magicians and fire eaters , ' according to its website			0
alcohol flows freely in @entity8 bars and clubs , which are typically attached to hotels , and revellers dress just as chicly and skimpily as they would in the @entity66			0
but while @entity8 is far more laid - back than nearby @entity68 or @entity69 , traditional @entity19 values remain strong , particularly among members of the local population who are far outnumbered by foreign residents			0
mr @entity11 was due to perform at the @entity46 nightclub before he was barred entry to the @entity19 city actions deemed insulting to local values , including public displays of affection , public intoxication and disrespect for religion , can lead to fines and jail time			1
@entity85 , the executive director of @entity86 , the company that runs the @entity8 branch of the club , said in a statement that it was ' a shame that @entity11 could n't join us this time			2

but by sunday , he seemed to be reconsidering			0
he said he would be happy to return if he had government assurance he 'd be let in			0
@entity11 , who has 453 piercings and two horns , said he hoped he would be let into @entity8 in the future			1
