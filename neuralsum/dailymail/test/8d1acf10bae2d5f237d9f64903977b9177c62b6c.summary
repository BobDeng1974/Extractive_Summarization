one of @entity1 ’s many managerial mantras – and there are already enough to fill a volume that would rival @entity5 ’s @entity4 – is : ‘ i always think that tomorrow i could be sacked ’			2
it perfectly illustrates his work ethic and his obsession with guarding against complacency but even he must know that right now no - one is further from the chop than the 44 - year - old coach who took @entity13 to the title last season and leads them into the @entity17 quarter - final against @entity18 on tuesday night			1
there was a communal sigh let - out across several boardrooms of top @entity23 football clubs two weeks ago when he put pen to paper on a new deal that ties him to the club until 2019			0
@entity1 shows off his playing skills as he prepare @entity13 for their @entity17 clash @entity1 talks to his squad ahead of @entity18 's visit on tuesday night in the quarter final first leg sporting directors from @entity34 to @entity35 were watching his situation carefully and the new four year contract with the option of a fifth season appears to have ended his chances of arriving in @entity41 or @entity42 this summer			1
back home in @entity18 the @entity13 supporters were delirious at the news			1
never mind that last year ’s title will not be repeated this season			2
the fans have long enough memories to remember how bad things were back in december 2011 , before his appointment			0
current @entity54 striker @entity53 would also remember that period well			0
he was just about to return from a cruciate ligament injury that had sidelined him for three months			0
the @entity58 manager has imposed his incredible work ethic on his players since joining @entity13 @entity1 has turned @entity13 around since joining in december 2011 , and recently extended his deal his @entity13 team - mates were stagnating under coach @entity63 and had just been knocked out of the @entity64 by a third division side , @entity66			1
@entity53 had previously been out on loan at @entity66 and had the good grace to go into their dressing - room after the game and congratulate his former team - mates on their giantkilling scalp			0
back in his own dressing room the mood was bleak			0
the team were closer to the relegation zone than the @entity23 places and @entity63 was soon sacked and replaced by @entity1			2
sceptics said his inexperience as a coach in @entity82 would prevent him succeeding			2
romantics said the former captain and double winner at @entity13 would bring back the glory days			0
without @entity53 , who was at first loaned out to @entity88 , @entity1 ’s @entity13 won the @entity89 and the @entity64			1
@entity53 returned to help them win the @entity90 and the league as well as making last season ’s @entity17 final			1
that final in @entity94 seemed to put real back on top in the @entity98 capital but @entity1 ’s noisy neighbours have refused to pipe - down			1
in the six subsequent matches between the two sides they have not let @entity18 win a single game			0
in the two - legged @entity105 at the start of the season @entity13 drew 1 - 1 in the @entity108 and beat @entity18 1 - 0 in the @entity109			1
they then went to the @entity108 in the league and won 2 - 1			0
@entity111 scores a brilliant bicycle kick during the 4 - 0 win over @entity18 at the @entity109 earlier this season @entity114 and @entity115 were unable to do anything to prevent @entity13 's dominance in february and when the two teams were drawn against each other in the @entity90 @entity13 won the first leg 2 - 0 and then drew the second			1
worse was to come for @entity18 in the @entity17 in february when they lost the away fixture 4 - 0			1
this season @entity13 are not going to win the league but no one is ruling out another tilt at the prize they were seconds from winning last season – leading from @entity131 ’s goal until the last minute when @entity132 scored to take the match to extra time			2
@entity13 players had told anyone who would listen throughout last season that while they did n’t give themselves much of a chance in @entity138 up against the stronger squads of @entity18 and @entity140 , they did fancy themselves in the @entity17 – ‘ we can beat anyone over two legs ’ was the message and that still stands			1
they showed tremendous resilience to come through against @entity146 in the last round with @entity148 scoring the last penalty of the shoot - out			2
@entity114 scored the fourth goal in @entity18 's win over their rivals in last year 's @entity17 final @entity1 's players watch on after losing out in @entity94 , but are determined to bounce back this year he put through his own net at the weekend in the league typifying that faltering league form and will probably make way for @entity160 tuesday			1
the battering - ram bought from @entity162 in the summer to replace @entity53 has not always met @entity1 ’s demands for constant pressing of the opposition ’s defence this season			2
after a fall - out with @entity169 , who in one recent match was visibly furious with his striker , a fragile truce has been called although the likes of @entity174 ’s @entity173 and @entity176 ’s @entity175 are being looked at as replacements for next season			0
@entity160 told his manager recently that he had regularly played through injury and wanted resting			0
he was obliged , and now looks set to be brought back in to face @entity182 and @entity132			0
former @entity162 striker @entity160 ( behind ) is set to start alongside @entity183 @entity160 has patched up his relationship with @entity1 and will play ahead of @entity148 on tuesday tuesday night may well be as much about keeping a clean sheet as scoring			1
@entity114 returns the scene of @entity18 ’s biggest crime this season – that 4 - 0 defeat in the league on the day he celebrated his 30th birthday			1
sometimes in training @entity1 likes to play a very special game of attack against defence			0
he lines up a first team back seven against 14 youth teamers			0
he ’s proud of the first - team defences ’ ability to keep the ball out of their goal despite being outnumbered two to one			0
whether 14 youth team players amounts to more or less than @entity115 , @entity114 and @entity205 is open to debate			0
but then again those three were all on the pitch back in february for the 4 - 0 @entity13 win and they never got anywhere near a goal			2
tuesday night is a chance for @entity18 to avenge that defeat , but it ’ s also another chance for @entity1 to show once again that in the @entity98 capital he is the boss .			1

@entity18 face @entity13 in @entity17 quarter - final on tuesday
@entity13 have won four and drawn two against @entity18 this season

@entity13 wo *n't* retain @entity138 title , but believe they can *challenge* in @entity82
