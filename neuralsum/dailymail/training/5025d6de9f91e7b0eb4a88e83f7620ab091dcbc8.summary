first there was uproar over news that unwanted @entity4 ponies were being slaughtered and fed to lions and tigers in zoos			1
now , @entity8 can reveal the hides of culled ponies are being crafted into ‘ wild pony ’ pagan drums – used in @entity14 - style retreats and musical performances to capture the rhythms of ‘ life and the moon ’			1
@entity4 ponies are a distinctive , hardy breed , essential to the maintenance of unique moorland landscapes and the rare insects they support			2
@entity24 , founder of friends of the @entity26 , said the culling scheme was ' a bitter pill to swallow ' but they have been in trouble for years			2
while they continue to reproduce , the prices they fetch at market have slumped – four ponies recently sold for £ 1 – and farmers can no longer afford to keep them			2
now , the autumn ‘ drifts ’ where the ponies are herded down from the hills to market have resulted in culls , with hundreds of unwanted animals – mainly the very young and the old – being slaughtered			1
where once 30,000 ponies roamed the moors , there are now believed to be fewer than 1,000 breeding mares			2
conservationists argue it would be more effective to reduce the number of stallions to stifle reproduction , rather than to slaughter so many animals			0
but the controversial zoo programme , set up by @entity55 , claims that selling the meat is a way to raise funds to conserve future herds			0
now , in addition to the zoo programme , the hides of culled ponies are being used to create hand - crafted drums			1
the drums are made by @entity65 , a musician and @entity4 resident , who runs alternative workshops and has been making traditional artisan hand - drums for 15 years , using locally sourced deer skin , and horse hides from @entity71			1
one of her cds is titled : ‘ @entity74 ’			0
last year , after speaking with @entity24 , founder of friends of the @entity26 , who has been battling to save the ponies for more than 16 years , she suggested she could use the hides of the culled ponies to make drums			1
‘ they are the first wild pony drums to be made in this country for a very long time , ’ ms @entity65 said			1
‘ and we see it as part of a wider regeneration project for the whole region			1
‘ it ’s a sensitive project and it ’s taken a year to get to this stage , as i have been working with other people in the community			0
but the ethos behind it is that nothing is wasted			0
as far as we know , this is the first time this has been done in this country			0
’ controversial drum - maker @entity65 runs alternative workshops and has been making artisan hand - drums for 15 years @entity24 said the culling scheme at first ‘ seemed like swallowing a bitter pill ’			1
‘ we had reached the desperate situation where there was nowhere for these unwanted ponies to go			1
it was breaking my heart , ’ she said			0
first using the ponies for zoo meat , then using their hides			2
we do n’t want to be shooting ponies and feeding them to lions			0
but the ponies face such a dire situation			0
and with this , we are protecting the herds , and the moors			0
and nothing is being wasted			0
@entity65 has made three of the pony drums so far and has given me one			1
it has the most amazing deep fur hide , is a sort of a stone colour , and has a very resonant sound			0
‘ i see the drums as a symbol of the ponies ’ voices … calling you to listen to their cry for support to help them continue looking after @entity4			2
’ journalist @entity140 visited @entity4 and followed the journey of the ponies from their slaughter , with bolt guns , to the zoo feeding , and the drum making process , for @entity148 ’s on @entity149			1
she describes the resulting 25 - minute programme as ‘ a hard listen ’ – a far cry from the 1930s , when there were said to be 30,000 ponies on the moors			1
but the demand for the ponies at market has been falling – particularly since the recession			0
the animal welfare lobby has argued the problem could be remedied by removing stallions			0
but local conservationists say stallions are essential for holding a herd together			0
‘ what we are doing sits within the conservation of our heritage , ’ ms @entity65 said			0
‘ we want to encourage people to support the care of these ponies and the drums are a way of doing this			2
’ but a spokesman for @entity176 , @entity176 , said culling was ‘ a cruel and ineffective way to manage pony numbers when chemical sterilisers are available ’			1
he added : ‘ that the slaughtered carcasses of these much loved animals are being turned into musical instruments or slabs of meat for depressed tigers in @entity190 ’s zoos is the final indignity			1

hides of culled ponies being crafted into ' wild pony ' drums used in retreats that ' capture the rhythm of life '
@entity202 drum - maker sees scheme as ' regeneration project '
however @entity176 describes process as ' the final indignity ' for the unwanted animals
