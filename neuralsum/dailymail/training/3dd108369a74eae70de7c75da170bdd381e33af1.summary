by @entity1 correspondent the first series was filled with such unremitting doom and gloom , viewers switched off in their droves			1
but in an effort to lighten the misery , it seems @entity10 has upset its remaining fans by veering into farce			1
the @entity14 costume drama was likened to a ‘ @entity15 film ’ yesterday after it featured a string of smutty jokes , full nudity and racy gay kiss in its opening episode			1
an average audience of just 4.6million tuned in on sunday night , compared to the 6.4million who watched the opening episode last year , and the 4.1million who watched the season one finale			1
much of the plotline was focused on the aristocratic @entity43 family , who spend the first episode trying to impress their distinguished house guest @entity24			1
in a string of sexually suggestive scenes , @entity47 , played by @entity48 , appeared intent on seducing her visitor and delivered several racy puns			2
in one highly - charged moment , lord @entity24 came down for breakfast after striding topless around the balcony of the house and started flirting with his hostess			2
after reminding him he is a married man , @entity47 lowered her voice to a husky drawl and asked him : ‘ now the pressing question is , how do you like your sausage ? ’ many viewers were left in no doubt she intended the remark to be a rude innuendo			1
writing on @entity72 , viewer @entity71 said she felt the comment was ‘ filth ’			1
@entity75 added : ‘ hold on ! ! light relief with a sausage joke ! ’ @entity78 said : ‘ how do you like your sausage in the morning ? ” , oh aye			0
’ several viewers took to @entity72 to discuss the @entity14 costume drama which was likened to a ‘ @entity15 film ’ viewers switched off in droves after a gloomy first series ( pictured is @entity87 who plays @entity89 ) the series has been written by @entity91 who was inspired by his grandparents who were shepherds as the episode wore on , @entity47 continued to shock viewers with her off - the - cuff remarks			1
at a family drinks party , she looked knowingly at another guest as she asked him how to pronounce the word ‘ cocktail ’ , saying ‘ does one put the stress on ‘ cock ’ or ‘ tail ? ’ ” in other scenes that were equally far removed from the gentility normally expected in costume dramas , a character repeatedly used the ‘ f - word ’ and described heiress @entity109 as a ‘ maniac for sex ’			0
in another sexually charged scene , the heir to the @entity43 fortune engaged in a furtive kiss with another man that threatens to derail his political career			0
meanwhile , the village fete descended into farce when a visiting boxer stripped off and walked completely naked through a throng of onlookers			2
on @entity72 , a viewer writing under the name @entity127 commented : ‘ so @entity10 has gone from wrist slitting depression to carry on innuendo in the space of one series			1
’ @entity133 , plays @entity134 , in the series which was criticised on @entity72 by viewers yesterday @entity137 with @entity138 ( left ) in the series and @entity140 and @entity141 ( right ) another wrote on the @entity14 @entity144 messageboard : ‘ it seemed a lot more @entity30 or @entity146 than the first season			1
even the livelihood threatening stuff about mr @entity134 not being able to pay the rent on the cowshed seemed to be played more for laughs than we ’d have seen in the first season			0
’ a third said : ‘ it all seemed to be a bit dumbed down , about @entity157 versus the @entity158			0
lord @entity159 [ sic ] was ridiculous			0
and i ’m not one to really notice background music , but this was awful , and syrupy ! ‘ i enjoyed the first series but wo n’t be bothering with the rest of this one			2
last time the complaints were it was to grim and dark , now it ’s dumbed down and syrupy			0
’ the bleak atmosphere of @entity10 last year was blamed in part on a particularly harsh winter experienced in the @entity170 where the drama is filmed			0
but the current series was shot in the spring and summer to lighten the tone			2
in june , its star @entity174 , 40 , promised it would be ‘ a little bit lighter ’ with ‘ more joy ’ , adding : ‘ life was bleak in those villages , trying to work a farm in those conditions ... but we ’re in the 1920s now			0
’ a @entity14 spokesman said : ‘ the shift in tone is in line with the time period as the life of the village moves away from the horror of war and into the roaring twenties			0
