skimpy bedwear : women in the south are more likely to put on sexy nightie for bed , while northern ladies prefer to cover up while @entity8 girls may be famed for the skimpy outfits they wear on a night out , it seems it is their @entity12 counterparts who are more relaxed when it comes to bedroom attire			1
according to new research , girls down @entity16 wear far skimpier clothes in bed at night , with 73 per cent of females in @entity21 sleeping in just their underwear or the nude			1
and the further north you go , the more likely you 'll find women covering up in flannel pyjama bottoms and long - sleeved tops , something researchers put down to the colder weather			1
@entity31 , head of lingerie buying and design at @entity34 , who carried out the survey , said : ' from barely - there sleepwear to bananas - in - pyjamas attire , there is a strong connection between what you wear to bed and where you live			1
' sleepwear is likely to be bought on impulse , but buying behaviour suggests that the further south you go , less is worn to bed			1
' @entity50 parties in the south may be a little bit more revealing than those in the north , with the sauciest sleepers living in the @entity55			2
' in the @entity55 - especially @entity56 , which has the second highest number of over 50s in @entity60 - short , thin - strapped , loose - fitting nightgowns and skimpy sleepwear are the most popular choices			2

paying attention to what you wear to bed is just as important as carefully choosing your day wardrobe			1
cosy and warm : northern women prefer comfort over style when it comes to nightwear ' the right sleepwear not only tells others a lot about you , it can also boost your feelings of self - esteem , sensuality and security			1
' @entity120 : flannel pyjamas and slippers - the most traditional style of nightwear which reflects a conventional personality			1
this style suggests a person who prefers comfort and warmth to unbridled passion			2
@entity70 : shorts and vests - not trying hard to seduce or impress , playful and comfortable with who they are			0
not quite bold enough to go fully nude , preferring to tease rather than reveal			0
south : undies or nothing - the uninhibited sleeper who slips under the sheets in just their undies , or nothing at all , is not afraid of their passionate side			0
bedtime may be more about sensuality and intimacy than it is about sleep			0
@entity79 : classic nightie - a classic nightie is the safe choice of someone always concerned about other people			0
she worries about what the postman might think if she has to make a quick dash for the door in the morning			0
@entity83 : long nightdresses and dressing gowns - indicates a person who sleeps alone , or who really feels the cold			0
