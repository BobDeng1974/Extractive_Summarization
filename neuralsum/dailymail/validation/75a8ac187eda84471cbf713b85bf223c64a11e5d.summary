they have urged other couples to invest time in their marriage as a preemptive measure , ' before it 's too late ' ' wrapped up in just getting through each day , the parents have little time left for each other , and the communication breakdown begins			2
' @entity1 has been keen to stress the importance of communication in a successful marriage , and has said she can see how couples can easily get so busy that they leave no time for each other			1
whilst many of her toddler - raising friends agree that marriage counselling is a good idea , @entity1 suggested that most couples who receive therapy make the decision too late			1
long periods apart : @entity1 has suggested that many couples become increasingly busy during parenthood , and leave little time for each other often , @entity1 says , this is due to a lack of time			2
she added : ' we spend a day deliberating about which sofa to buy , but we ca n’t relinquish an hour for the sake of our marriages ? ' and the @entity63 ' marriage has faced more challenges than most in recent years			1

it was the trauma of losing their third child that drew the @entity63 to see a counsellor			0
@entity1 now compares therapy sessions to being as essential as seeing a dentist or optician ( stock image ) but it was the trauma of losing their third child last year that compelled the @entity63 to see a counsellor			2

they rarely argue , @entity1 says , but when they do , they can be particularly hard to get over			0
the house is the thing they say they 're most likely to row about - and a confrontation can often take them weeks to recover from			0

moving forward : @entity1 is using her experiences of motherhood in her own pregnancy clinic in @entity131 advising other mums - to - be ' i ’d argue our emotional wellbeing is significantly more important than our cars , eyes or teeth , ' says @entity1			0
' if you can learn how to be strong while the going is easy , you will be better equipped for the more challenging terrain when it comes			0
