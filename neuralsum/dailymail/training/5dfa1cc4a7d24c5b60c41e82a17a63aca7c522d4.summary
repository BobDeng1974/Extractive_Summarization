by @entity0 two new signals have been picked up from deep in the @entity3 , possibly from the black box carried on the missing @entity6 jet , it was revealed today			1
air chief marshal @entity7 , who is co-ordinating the search in @entity9 , said the discovery by the @entity12 ship @entity11 was ' further encouraging ' news in the search for @entity15			1
mr @entity7 said the first signal was picked up yesterday afternoon and the second late last night			1
this brings the number of transmissions detected by the high - tech @entity12 vessel that might be from the crashed jet to four			2
' yesterday 's signals will assist in better defining a reduced and much more manageable search area on the ocean floor ' he said			1
despite what mr @entity7 described as ' further encouraging findings ' he said that the underwater vehicle ' @entity43 21 ' , which can ' sniff out ' objects deep in the ocean , would not be launched until the search area could be narrowed			1
' i believe we are searching in the right area , but we need to visually identify aircraft wreckage before we can confirm with certainty that this is the final resting place of @entity15 , ' he said			1
' i 'm not prepared to confirm anything until such time as somebody lays eyes on the wreckage			1
' more signals : a handout image released by the @entity59 ( @entity59 ) shows the search area in the @entity3 , @entity61 of @entity12 , where 15 planes and 14 ships are scouring a 75,423 square km area of ocean for the wreckage of flight mh370 more than a month after it disappeared an @entity68 returns to @entity69 after a day of searching an area in the @entity3 for the missing @entity15 a map from @entity59 shows where pinger contacts have been recorded in the search for flight mh370 however , @entity76 captain @entity75 said the detections indicate the device emitting the pings is somewhere within about a 12 - mile radius			1
that would still equate to a 500 square mile chunk of the ocean floor - an area that would take the @entity86 sub between six weeks to two months to canvas			0
data analysis of the first two detections at the weekend has shown they were consistent with the specification and description of a flight data recorder , said the air chief marshal			1
the @entity12 @entity95 based at @entity96 in @entity97 , on the @entity99 coast south of @entity100 , concluded that the two detections were from a source that was not of ' natural origin ' and was ' likely sourced ' from specific electronic equipment			0
mr @entity7 , pointing out that his optimism had risen since sunday , warned that a lot of silt could complicate the search , which is being boosted by a sonar buoy and a modified @entity111 aircraft to co-ordinate with @entity11			2
' it 's important for @entity11 to collect as much data as possible ahead of deploying @entity43 21 , ' he said			0
' the reason we want to do that is there 's no second chances			0
' the pings detected by the @entity12 defence vessel @entity11 's pinger locator in the search for the missing flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder in the southern @entity3 may now not be released the towed pinger locator ( @entity126 - 25 ) on the deck of the @entity128 detected two signals which were thought to be from a black box transponder , but further analysis has shown the signals may have no connection with @entity15 the @entity86 21 submarine drone , which will be used to scour the seabed for @entity15 once the search area in narrowed down further , is hosited on board the @entity128 after buoyanct testing he warned that the recently - detected signals have been much weaker than the original signals detected - ' so that means probably we 're either a long way from it , or in my view , more likely , the batteries are starting to fade and as a consequence the signal is becoming weaker			1
' he added : ' so we need to , as we say in @entity12 , make hay while the sun shines			0
' @entity11 , he said , would be looking to pick up more transmissions that would help to better pinpoint where the signal was coming from			0
once the search area has been narrowed , ships and aircraft could then find something in ' a matter of days , ' he suggested			0
he continued to express optimism that searchers were closing in on the plane 's final resting place , despite what he believed were signals from dying batteries			2
@entity86 21 , takes six times longer to cover the same area as the pinger locator , which is pulled behind the boat at a depth of 3,000 metres			0
a @entity111 @entity174 is seen parked on the tarmac after returning from a search mission for debris from missing @entity15 yesterday @entity179 confidence of @entity181 commodore @entity180 ( pictured , right , with search chief @entity7 last month ) of the recorded pings being from missing @entity15 has now waned the sub 's sonar can scan only about 100 metres and it can ' see ' with lights and cameras only a few metres			1
the maximum depth it can dive is 4,500 metres , and some areas of the search zone are deeper			0
search crews are also contending with a thick layer of silt on the sea floor that can both hide any possible wreckage and distort the sounds emanating from the black boxes that may be resting there , said mr @entity180 , who is helping to lead the search			2
captain @entity75 said : ' it 's certainly a man - made device emitting that signal and i have no explanation for what other component could be there			0
' i 'm an engineer so i do n't talk emotions too much			2
but certainly when i received word that they had another detection , you feel elated			0
' you 're hopeful that you can locate the final resting place of the aircraft and bring closure to all the families involved			0

two new signals have been detected in the @entity3
authorities believe they are linked to the missing flight @entity15
the first was picked up yesterday afternoon and the second late last night
a total of four ping signals have been detected now
