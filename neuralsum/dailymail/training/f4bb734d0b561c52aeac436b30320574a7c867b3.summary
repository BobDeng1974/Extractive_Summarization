@entity22 would always remember the blood - soaked rose petals strewn after the shooting his expression would haunt her for the rest of her life			1
' he looked puzzled , ' she later said			0
' i remember he looked as if he just had a slight headache			0
' @entity1 writes that she watched while , as if in slow motion , her husband 's head began to come apart			1
' i could see a piece of his skull coming off , ' she recalled			0
' it was flesh - colored , not white			0
i can see this perfectly clean piece detaching itself from his head			0
then he slumped in my lap. ' the world watched as a stricken @entity22 crawled over the trunk of the @entity58 the couple were traveling in and reached out			2
to many , it appeared she was trying to reach out to a @entity62 agent			0
in fact , she was grasping for a large piece of her husband 's skull and brain that had landed on the car 's hood			1
true love : @entity1 writes that the president and @entity17 had become closer than ever in their final year of marriage after losing their infant son @entity13 sound impulses recorded on the microphone of a @entity20 police officer amounted to evidence of a shot from the infamous ' grassy knoll ' in @entity19 , and thus of an additional gunman besides @entity83 firing from a building window she was pushed back into the car , where she cradled her stricken husband 's head with her gloved hands , pressing them to his skull ' to keep the brains in , ' she said later			1
@entity1 writes that @entity22 whispered , ' @entity93 , @entity93 , @entity93 ! can you hear me ? ' his blue eyes were wide open and fixed			2
' i love you , @entity93 , ' she said			0
' the president still had a faint pulse when he was admitted to @entity100			0
as doctors began administering a massive blood transfusion , @entity22 , in her blood - and - gore - soaked @entity104 suit , handed doctors what she had been cupping in her hands since the shooting : the piece of her husband 's brain			1
the doctors tried to force @entity22 to leave as they worked on her husband , but she refused			1
' i will not leave , ' she said			0
' it ’s my husband			0
his blood , his brains , are all over me			0
' acting on instinct : @entity22 would later say she had no memory of crawling onto the @entity58 's trunk to retrieve parts of her husband 's skull motorcade : @entity125 does not suggest the @entity127 files point to agency involvement in the assassination itself , but more likely that their release would show the @entity131 trying to keep secret its own flawed performance before the assassination when doctors informed mrs @entity22 that her husband had died , she was unable to speak , simply mouthing , ' i know			1
' medical staff watched as @entity22 tenderly kissed her husband 's white foot , sticking out from beneath the sheet doctors had covered him with			1
she pulled the sheet back to expose her husband 's face and shoulders			2
@entity1 writes that @entity22 later said ' his mouth was so beautiful			2
' ' @entity4 then began kissing @entity93 again — starting with his exposed foot and then , through the sheet , slowly , deliberately , working her way up , ' writes @entity1			0
she kissed her husband 's foot , then his leg , thigh , chest and finally his lips			1
according to a doctor , it was the most moving thing any of those who were present had ever seen			2
friends later reported that @entity22 , usually so spotless , refused to take off her blood - soaked suit , ' as though she did n't want the day to end			1
