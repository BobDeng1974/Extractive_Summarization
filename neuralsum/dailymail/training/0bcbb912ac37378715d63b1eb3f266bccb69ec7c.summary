by @entity0 published : 05:02 est , 24 august 2013 updated : 11:08 est , 24 august 2013 student halls in @entity2 , a budget hotel in central @entity4 and a ' vertical pier ' in @entity6 are all in the running to be named @entity9 's ugliest new building			1
the shortlist for the annual @entity11 has been revealed , highlighting six new buildings judged to be the latest ' architectural travesties ' erected across @entity9			1
the name of the competition is inspired by prince @entity17 's description of @entity18 proposed @entity20 extension as a ' monstrous carbuncle on the face of a much - loved friend			1
' controversial : @entity26 's @entity25 student accommodation by @entity27 , @entity2 , which has the unenviable distinction of being the most - nominated project in the history of the @entity11 that extension was never built , but the prince 's evocative description lives on thanks to trade magazine @entity35 , which launched the competition eight years ago as a comic counterpart to the prestigious @entity39 prize			1
in a statement the magazine said : ' even in times of economic turmoil , when few major projects are being built , hundreds of architectural travesties are allowed to pass through our planning system on a weekly basis			2
' few of these are ever truly exposed for the awfulness they represent - lazy design , compromised planning departments and cynical development			2
' the shortlist has been whittled down from hundreds of nominations sent in by readers of @entity35 , which caters to an audience of architects and designers			2
@entity61 : the @entity63 student accommodation at 465 @entity64 was nearly refused planning permission because of a lack of natural light first on the list is a project that has had the unenviable distinction of being the most - nominated development in the history of the @entity11 , says @entity35			1
@entity25 housing in @entity2 , designed by @entity25 , is comprised of eight very plain blocks of @entity26 student accommodation plonked right next to the picturesque @entity27 , an area of land beside the @entity77 that has hardly changed in thousands of years			2
the project , described as like building a ' skyscraper next to @entity80 ' , has been mired in controversy and it is now at the centre of a judicial review bid to determine if the planning process which led to its approval was properly carried out			1
another block of student accommodation which made the @entity11 's shortlist was initially refused its planning permission on the grounds that not enough light would enter the building to make it liveable			1
the block at number 465 @entity64 , near @entity97 , which will house students at @entity63 was only built after an inspector decided that the student lifestyle meant that rooms would only be used for sleeping - so they did n't need their legal quota of natural light			2
despite its £ 18milllion pound cost , the @entity104 quoted one local resident who described the development as ' so cheap and aesthetically bankrupt it can only be described as an insult to the people of @entity111 , and the architectural profession			0
' it is designed by @entity114 & partners			0
' grossly over-scaled ' : the @entity117 building on @entity118 in @entity119 , @entity4 , a ' characterless lump ' which critics have slammed for failing to blend into the @entity123 buildings that surround it another residential monstrosity in the running for @entity9 's ugliest building of the year is the 25 - storey @entity117 building on @entity118 in @entity4 's trendy @entity119 area , which @entity35 describe as ' grossly over-scaled '			1
the @entity132 development has been slammed for its failure to blend in with neighbouring @entity123 buildings , with the critic who nominated it calling it a ' hideous monstrosity ... a characterless lump that is totally out of scale to the buildings around it			0
' the third @entity4 newbuild to make the shortlist is the 234 - room @entity145 on @entity146 in @entity147 , designed by @entity148 , part of which is housed in a listed former maternity hospital			0
' lumpen ' : the 234 - room @entity145 on @entity146 in @entity147 , designed by @entity148 , is the third @entity4 building to make the @entity11 shortlist , and which building design describes as a ' travesty ' the rest of the building has taken the place of a @entity163 red - brick @entity161 nurses ' home demolished to make was for its tower			1
@entity35 says : ' the @entity145 in @entity166 is a travesty in more ways than one - we shudder at its lumpen form and mourn the building demolished to make way for it			2
' elsewhere , the @entity174 by @entity175 is slammed as ' shape making gone horribly , horribly wrong			0
' vertical pier : the @entity174 was unveiled in march as the centrepiece of a £ 75million seafront regeneration			0
critics said they would have preferred a conventional , horizontal pier instead ' the dumpster ' : the stark - looking @entity183 in @entity184 , @entity185 , is also part of a multimillion pound seafront redevelopment , but its skip - like shape has led to an unfortunate nickname the brightly coloured 80ft tower - reminiscent of the shape of a fun fair helter skelter - was unveiled in march as the centrepiece of a £ 75million seafront regeneration on the @entity196 seaside town			0
it is described as a ' vertical pier ' , but critics said they would have preferred a normal , horizontal pier instead			0
making up the final place on the @entity11 shortlist is the @entity203 in @entity184 , @entity185 , by @entity204			1
the stark - looking structure is also part of a multimillion pound seafront redevelopment , but its curious skip - like shape has now apparently led locals to dub it ' the dumpster '			0
a critic dubbed it ' oppressively bland and totally insensitive to the beautiful surrounding coast			0
' a final winner will be selected by a jury including @entity35 executive editor @entity216 and critics @entity217 and @entity219 and announced on august 30 .			0

these are the developments shortlisted for @entity222 's annual @entity11 , awarded each year to @entity9 's ugliest new building
