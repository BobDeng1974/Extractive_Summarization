@entity0 and her baby @entity1 died on a train track after the mother was told she could n't getpsychiatric help , an inquest has heard a mother cradling her three - year - old son lay down in front of a train after being told by her psychiatrist ' i ca n't help you ' , an inquest has heard			1
@entity0 , 41 , had been denied urgent psychiatric help in the months before she and her son @entity1 died on train tracks in south @entity18 in march 2013 , it was claimed			1
just three months before her death , she took an overdose while visiting a friend in @entity23 and was ' disappointed ' to have survived , the inquest was told			1
a care worker treating the accounts assistant from @entity26 in south @entity18 then told her family she needed ' urgent ' home care on her discharge			1
despite being promised this by mental health bosses , ms @entity0 was then told the home team could not provide psychiatric help , the inquest heard			1
an inquest into the two deaths at @entity38 today heard her mother @entity39 describe the family 's battle to secure the right therapy for her daughter			1
she told the inquest her daughter went alone to visit friend @entity45 in @entity23 to ' work on her anxiety ' in december 2012 but took an overdose			1
a day later she was seen by @entity49 , a social worker in @entity50 , who recommended that she received ' intensive home therapy '			2
after agreeing to receive treatment and telling doctors she recognised the consequences of her behaviour , she was then deemed ' not treatable '			0
in a statement given to the inquest mr @entity49 said he contacted health workers in @entity26 with his concerns and said : ' [ they ] said there was a home treatment team that covered @entity0 's locality			1
' however her mother told the court that on her daughter 's return to @entity18 , a psychiatric nurse said this was not the case			1
mrs @entity0 told the inquest : ' we said @entity0 had just come out of intensive care , @entity49 had faxed his concerns through saying she needed urgent treatment			1
she said ' we did n't do urgent treatment here			0
' in desperation the family turned to her psychiatrist , dr @entity77 , but mrs @entity0 added : ' @entity0 said she was unhappy to have survived her suicide attempt			0
' i said to dr @entity77 about mr @entity49 's report ... she was recommended home treatments , there was nothing in actual fact			2
dr @entity77 said he could n't help us			0
' mrs @entity0 had starting suffering depression after going to @entity1 's father , @entity88 , in @entity89 trainee psychologist dr @entity90 , said : ' potentially any patient can benefit from home treatment			2
' i do n't really know how the home treatment team ( @entity96 ) works in @entity50 , there is a suggestion that there is some psychological treatment that they could give			1
' however in @entity101 in @entity18 the @entity96 is not experienced in providing psychiatric therapy			1
' in @entity50 they said the @entity96 is necessary because of the skills of the team , but the same may not be same in @entity18			1
' i also suspect that the @entity96 threshold in @entity50 might be much lower than in @entity18			1
' dr @entity77 said that a faxed note from @entity50 social worker @entity49 had not been ' uploaded ' to computer systems			0
in a statement the social worker told the inquest that he had advised ms @entity0 was given home treatment and checked that it would be available in @entity26			1
after seeing ms @entity0 on return from @entity23 dr @entity77 advised that she was assigned a ' care coordinator ' to be provided through the @entity18 and @entity116			1
however a miscommunication meant that the intended nurse , @entity119 , was not informed , the inquest heard			2
ms @entity0 was seen by the nurse for an assessment on december 17 , just days after her failed suicide bid			0
she admitted to @entity123 that she had not checked the notes faxed by the @entity50 team			2
she said : ' it 's not something i would usually do , but i ca n't remember why i did n't contact @entity50			0
' when asked if she agreed she should have she replied ' yes , if i had the time			0
' instead the nurse said it was a ' duty crisis ' and her only objective was to make sure her patient was on the right medication			0
' the immediate problem presented to me was how is she doing to be safe , ' she told the inquest			1
the coroner highlighted that without contacting the doctors who treated her for her overdose she would n't have been able to give the correct advice , to which the nurse agreed			2
@entity142 , representing ms @entity0 's family , said the nurse had done ' the very minimum ' considering she was assessing someone who had just tried to kill themselves			0
as a result ms @entity0 was not immediately referred to the @entity96			0
she was admitted to @entity149 at the @entity150 , @entity26 , on january 17 after telling her sister that she wanted to end her life			0
it was not until then that dr @entity77 finally made a recommendation that the nurse be assigned as her care coordinator			1
but he no longer had any contact with the family after mid-january as the trainee , on a six - month rotation scheme , left the clinic			0
the inquest heard how ms @entity0 began suffering with severe anxiety after a period of cocaine use that came to an end in @entity169 when she went to see @entity1 's @entity89 father , @entity88			2
but going clean left her terrified she had caused herself permanent harm and , through tears , mrs @entity0 said : ' @entity0 was worried about her mental health , she had panic attacks and suffered with anxiety			0
' she kept saying to me ' am i going to get better ? ' i said ' of course you are going to get better			0
' in september 2012 , the family arranged to see a private psychiatrist who diagnosed an anxiety disorder , but they were told that they would have to wait up to 18 months for therapy sessions on the @entity185			1
her mother said : ' i wanted to take her to see somebody so there could be some reassurance that she had n't damaged herself , that there were possibilities of her getting better			2
' ms @entity0 was left to cope with the medication and suffered with side effects , but struggled at work as her illness affected her concentration			0
the mother and baby were seen lying on the tracks at @entity201 , before their deaths her condition deteriorated to the point she had to leave work and could not look after her son properly , the inquest heard			1
' she wanted to get better			0
i looked after @entity1 , even though @entity0 was ill she would give him a kiss in the morning and at night when he went to bed , ' her mother told the inquest			1
