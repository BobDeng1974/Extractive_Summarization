one chief constable said his officers had become an ‘ extension of social services ’ as a result of the crisis in dementia care			1
most incidents involved patients who had gone missing but call - outs also included incidents where care home or hospital staff had become unable to cope			1
@entity24 attended 1,800 incidents last year concerning vulnerable patients in hospitals and care homes or when they went missing			1
of these , 71 involved violence			0
sir @entity30 , chief constable of @entity31 , described his force as becoming an ‘ outpost of the @entity34 ’ and an ‘ extension of social services ’			1
he added that because dementia sufferers are vulnerable patients , his officers are duty - bound to prioritise their cases and stay with them for ‘ hours ’ in hospitals			2
‘ we have seen a number of incidents where we feel our officers are called inappropriately to care homes and the wards of hospitals to try and restrain patients , ’ he said			2
‘ we have made it really clear that should only happen in the most extreme of circumstances			0
’ sir @entity30 suggested introducing a national database of carers and the families of elderly vulnerable people so that officers could phone a carer in an emergency			2

some 2,979 restraint orders were granted for such patients last year , up from 1,459 in 2009/10			0
the measures are officially referred to as @entity92 and are sometimes necessary to prevent confused patients wandering off or harming themselves			0
but as they breach patients ’ human rights , staff must apply to either their @entity34 trust or care home before resorting to them			1
@entity24 attended 1,800 incidents last year concerning vulnerable patients in hospitals and care homes or when they went missing ( file picture ) figures from the @entity106 show that 6,355 applications were made by hospital staff and carers to restrain dementia patients in 2012/13 , but just under half – 2,979 – were approved			1
