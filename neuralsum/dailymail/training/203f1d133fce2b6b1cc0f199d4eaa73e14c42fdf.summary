by @entity1 reporter the @entity2 said it has uncovered a nearly century - old container of ricin and a handful of other forgotten samples of dangerous pathogens as it combs its laboratories for improperly stored hazardous materials			1
the agency began an intensive investigation of all its facilities after a scientist in july found vials of smallpox dating from the 1950s , along with other contagious viruses and bacteria that had been stored and forgotten in one lab on the @entity2 's campus			1
friday , the @entity2 said in different facilities , it found small amounts of five improperly stored ' select agents , ' pathogens that must be registered and kept only in certain highly regulated laboratories			1
the @entity2 has found a container of ricin and other forgotten samples of dangerous pathogens lost in its facilities for nearly a century all were found in sealed and intact containers , with no evidence that they posed a safety risk to anyone in the labs or surrounding areas , the agency said in a memo to employees			1
they included a bottle of ricin , a highly poisonous toxin , found in a box with microbes dating from 1914 and thought to be 85 to 100 years old , the memo said			0
the bottle was labeled as originally containing 5 grams , although @entity2 does n't know how much was left			0
ricin has legitimate research uses , the @entity2 said , but was not studied in this lab. also discovered were samples listing pathogens that cause botulism , plague , tularemia and a rare tropical infection called melioidosis			2
the @entity2 does have laboratories that are cleared to use select agents , and those pathogens are regularly inventoried , said @entity2 director of research services dr. @entity60 , who oversees agency security and safety issues			1
@entity47 , an incredibly dangerous poison , is derived from this castor oil plant , known as @entity67 communis but these samples were in different labs , mostly in historical collections that scientists once routinely kept in the backs of freezers or on dusty shelves but that today require special handling			0
' @entity2 takes this matter very seriously			0
the finding of these agents highlights the need for constant vigilance in monitoring laboratory materials in compliance with federal regulations on biosafety , ' the agency memo said			0
separately friday , the @entity86 reported it had found still another improperly stored pathogen in one of its laboratories - staphylococcus enterotoxin that can cause food poisoning			2
the vials were in a locked freezer but not in a lab registered to work with select agents			2
they were relocated to a registered lab , and later destroyed , @entity86 said .			0

@entity99 began investigating facilities after a scientist discovered smallpox samples from the 1950s this july
@entity2 has since discovered small amounts of five improperly stored ' select agents ' which must be registered and kept in highly regulated labs
@entity2 says the agents were found in sealed containers and posed no safety risks
