a stranded cargo ship carrying 1,200 luxury cars has refloated itself on a high tide just hours after a previous salvage mission failed			1
the 51,000 - tonne @entity4 was grounded deliberately on a sandbar as it left @entity7 on saturday night after it started listing dangerously in a busy shipping lane with 25 crew aboard			1
a plan to re-float it today costing a reputed £ 10million had to be abandoned amid warnings of poor weather - but at lunchtime today it began to drift of its own accord , sparking frantic attempts to tow it to a more stable position in the @entity18			1
a spokesman for @entity35 , the firm leading the salvaging operation , said : ' she appears to have come adrift herself on the high tide			1
' they are rushing down there to take advantage of it and hopefully get control of her movements			0
they are going to see if they can stabilise her and get her off the bank and into safe waters in the @entity18			1
' @entity51 said it found out the ship was floating when salvage workers raised the alarm while still on board			2
a @entity57 spokesman added : ' the ship self floated at 1.55pm and all salvors had left the vessel safely			1
' the list of the ship is unchanged and the vessel is under tow to a preferred holding position two miles east of the original grounding position			1
' the ship was moved to @entity66 , a point in the @entity18 just outside @entity68 , after the @entity57 originally said it would be held inside the harbour itself			1
an existing 200 - metre exclusion zone was extended to 500 metres as the ship moved at a speed of around two knots			1
valuable : the ship was carrying 1,400 vehicles including @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 , jcbs and @entity79 worth £ 260,000 safety : the ship being towed at a speed of two knots this afternoon			2
a new 300 - metre exclusion zone was set to be established a new 300 - metre exclusion zone will be established around the vessel while the damage is assessed			0
salvage teams say it may have taken on a substantial amount of water which will need pumping out			0
the car transporter was originally to be towed to @entity7 but at 4.30pm the @entity57 announced a change of plan			2
it was carrying around 1,400 vehicles including 1,200 @entity75 and @entity77 , @entity76 , 105 pieces of @entity96 construction equipment and a @entity79 worth an estimated £ 260,000			0
all were destined for the @entity97 , and the ship was sailing for @entity99 in @entity100 when it ran aground at 9.20pm on saturday			1
as the ship tilted at 45 degrees , a dramatic air and sea rescue operation was launched which lasted several hours and resulted in 23 crew and the pilot being successfully winched from the ship			2
a 24th crew member was plucked from the water by lifeboat crews after he jumped from the low side of the ship and suffered a broken leg			2
its owners @entity112 said the 590ft - long ship had to be grounded deliberately on the @entity115 sandbar after it started listing dangerously			1
they are still investigating what caused it to tilt			0
@entity118 : the 51,000 - tonne vessel ran aground next to a busy shipping lane which takes tourists from @entity7 to the @entity33 fame : the sandbar is well - known among locals and hosts an annual cricket match between rival yacht clubs			1
the grounding was deliberate dwarfed : a passenger launch next to the ship			0
salvage crew members were still aboard when it began to drift of its own accord on the tide chief executive @entity135 said : ' the pilot and the master took the decision to save the vessel and its crew by grounding her on the bank			1
this showed great skill and seamanship on behalf of our crew when faced with such challenging circumstances			0
' at this stage it is too early to speculate on the cause of the list but we are starting an immediate investigation			0
an investigation is ongoing as to what occurred last night and that is being conducted by the @entity157			0
' our chief concern now is to ensure there is no environmental damage from this incident			0
there is no oil spill reported at this point , however we understand that the @entity166 authorities have brought their spill response to a state of active readiness			0
' the ship 's 500 tonnes of fuel were kept on board to prevent any leakage while attempting to move it			2
stronger winds today may also have played a part in the ship shifting			0
at midday , wind speeds reached 25mph with gusts of 37mph before peaking at around 1pm with 28mph winds and gusts of 37mph			0
mission : the ship 's 500 tonnes of fuel were kept on board to prevent any potential ' environmental damage ' while attempting to move it a salvage tug lights the hull of the stricken @entity191 cargo ship after it ran aground on a sand bank in the @entity18 near @entity193 members of @entity195 pictured as they inspect the listing @entity4 during the rescue of the 25 - strong crew , which included a helicopter it was revealed yesterday that water had seeped into the ship after a digger it was carrying came loose and smashed into the hull , puncturing it			1
that damage has now been fixed			0
but the @entity57 said the water let in would need to be removed prior to a refloating and this would take too long to carry out before the weather window for the operation closes , with stronger winds forecast for the coming days			0
they had instead intended to anchor the ship down to prevent it from moving so it could up put upright and refloated on a future date			0
@entity115 is a well - known sandbar in @entity27 , and is the scene of an annual cricket match between two yachting clubs when the sands are exposed in low spring tides			2
in november 2008 , the @entity225 liner queen elizabeth 2 with 1,700 passengers on board ran aground on @entity115 but was able to continue its journey on the rising tide after four tugs pulled it clear .			1

@entity4 ran aground as it left @entity7 for @entity99 , @entity100 , on saturday with 25 crew aboard
@entity236 said it began to list severely for *unknown* reasons so was steered towards sandbar
£ 10million attempt to refloat it called off *due* to poor weather - but then it began to move on its own in high tide
that sparked a frantic attempt to tow the ship , still listing *heavily* , to a more stable position in the @entity18
