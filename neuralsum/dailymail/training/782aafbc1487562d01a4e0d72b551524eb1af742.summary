by @entity0 just days after leaked images suggested @entity4 ’s @entity3 will have a protruding camera , a patent has been issued giving an insight into what this feature may be used for			1
the patent , initially filed in 2012 , describes a bayonet mount system for an @entity3 camera			1
the system is similar to that currently used on slr cameras and lets photographers attach and remove interchangeable lenses using a twist and lock motion			1
it describes a bayonet mount system for an @entity3 camera , patent image pictured			1
the system is similar to that currently used on slr cameras and lets photographers attach and remove interchangeable lenses easily the bayonet mount system is currently used on slr cameras , for example , and lets photographers attach and remove interchangeable lenses using a twist and lock motion			1
the bayonet connector system is the standard light bulb fitting in the @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 and other countries			2
one side of the mount features radial pins that lock into a l - shaped slot on the other side ( pictured above )			0
@entity4 said the system is preferable to screw mounts because it is more discreet , and is more secure than magnetic connectors			1
bayonet connectors are also the standard light bulb fitting in the @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 and other countries			0
according to the @entity4 patent : ' it may be desirable to couple a lens to a portable electronic device including a camera			2
‘ the camera may not include optical zoom functionality , wide angle capability , or certain filters , and hence the addition of an accessory device may be desirable			0
' it continued that current lens accessory devices and attachment options for phones have been ‘ unsatisfactory ’ , such as screw mount systems			2
@entity4 said screw mount systems can be bulky and increase in the size of the phone , and this may be ‘ undesirable to a consumer			2
’ the patent also explained a magnetic connection may be another option , but did n't feel this was secure enough when walking or holding the device			2
‘ additionally , if the magnetic ring is improperly aligned with respect to the camera , the view through the lens may be obstructed or distorted , ’ said the patent			0
@entity4 ’s solution is a bayonet attachment that is functional , but takes up the least amount of space on the device			0
images posted to @entity89 social network @entity88 earlier this week appear to show a rounded design and a protruding camera for the @entity3 , pictured left , similar to those seen on the @entity93			1
this protruding camera could be used to house the bayonet connector , pictured right , for its proposed interchangeable lenses the protruding camera and rounded edges of the purported @entity3 prototypes are similar to those seen on the current @entity93 model , pictured			1
but this feature was purely design - led and was n't used to add lenses the bayonet mount , pictured , would be built onto the @entity3 's rear - facing camera and would protrude marginally above the case the mount would be built - in to the @entity3 ’s rear - facing camera bezel , which would protrude marginally above the case			1
various lenses with bayonet - style connectors would then be attached and locked into place			2
to prevent damage to the lens , if the phone is dropped for example , @entity4 continued that the mount could be fixed on a ‘ ramped surface ’			0
this would allow the lens to detach from the device without twisting , if the lens is hit from a certain angle			0
images posted to @entity89 social network @entity88 earlier this week purporting to show the next @entity4 device are thought to have been leaked by an anonymous insider working at @entity4 supplier @entity129			1
although the images are blurry , they appear to show a rounded design and a protruding camera , similar to those seen on the @entity93			1
current @entity3 models feature cameras that sit flush the with rear casing			0
alternatively , the models shown in the pictures could be the next generation of @entity4 's mp3 player			0
there are already detachable lenses that work with @entity3 devices , such as the @entity145			0
this attachment comes with four lenses that create a range of photo effects including fisheye and wide - angle , plus 10x and 15x macro zoom			0
each lens can be used interchangeably , simply by screwing them on and off , and the whole system costs £ 69.99 .			0

the patent describes a bayonet mount system for an *iphone*
it would mean interchangeable lenses could be added to @entity4 devices
bayonet mounts are smaller and more *conspicuous* than screw mounts
they are also more secure than magnetic connectors , for example
images leaked this week showed an @entity4 case with a protruding camera - which could be used as a connector for these interchangeable lenses
