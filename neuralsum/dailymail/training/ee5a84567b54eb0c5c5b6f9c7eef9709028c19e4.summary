former secretary of state @entity2 's @entity1 buzz got a boost wednesday with word that donors and @entity8 partisans would meet friday for a @entity10 planning confab			1
but hours later @entity11 , a former one - term @entity12 senator , sucked all the oxygen out of her news cycle with word that he had launched a presidential exploratory committee			1
only months ago the 2016 @entity19 presidential campaign season was seen as a formality , a drawn - out @entity8 coronation			1
but now there 's another voice in the conversation , and it may appeal to right - leaning @entity19 : @entity11 was once secretary of the navy during @entity26 's presidency			1
he also has solid national security bona fides that can match with @entity8 's tenure as @entity30 's top diplomat , and a military service record that she ca n't equal			1
but @entity11 is seen as less stridently liberal than @entity8 , which could give her a rhetorical foil when she argues her case to the @entity19 's left wing			1
that was the party constituency that abandoned her in 2008 , siding with a little - known @entity42 senator named @entity43			0
secretary of agriculture @entity63 will speak to the group in a panel discussions entitled , ' why i 'm ready for @entity2 , ' according to @entity69 newspaper			0
only donors who have kicked in at least $ 5,000 to the pro-clinton committee have been invited			0
@entity8 herself will not attend			0
other speakers on the lineup include @entity76 executive director @entity75 and @entity78 president @entity77 , whose group grooms and backs candidates who favor abortion rights			0
strategists @entity83 , @entity84 and @entity85 will attend – all old names from president @entity8 's orbit			2
' if she 's ready to start the engine , so are we , ' one event organizer told @entity69			0
@entity11 announced his exploratory committee 's formation in a message posted from his @entity94 account late wednesday , making him the first candidate of either of the two major political parties to take an official step toward running for the @entity1			2
' a strong majority of @entity30 agree that we are at a serious crossroads , ' @entity11 wrote in a message posted to a website for his committee along with a 14 - minute video address			1
' in my view , the solutions are not simply political , but those of leadership			0
i learned long ago on the battlefields of @entity110 that in a crisis , there is no substitute for clear - eyed leadership			2
' the former @entity12 senator has hinted at a possible presidential campaign for months and made campaign appearances this fall with @entity19 in the early voting states of @entity119 and @entity120			2
but any @entity19 presidential primary candidate not named @entity2 is considered a long shot at this stage			2
@entity11 's surprise announcement , released shortly before midnight , sets off the possibility of a challenge , at least			1
the field could also include vice president @entity128 , @entity130 gov. @entity129 and @entity132 sen. @entity131 , an independent who is considering running in the @entity19 primary			1
other names floated to @entity135 by pollsters and fundraisers in background conversations include @entity140 sen. @entity139 , housing and urban development secretary @entity141 , @entity143 sen. @entity142 , @entity12 sen. @entity144 and @entity146 gov. @entity145			2
former secretary of state @entity2 had all the @entity19 's presidential momentum a few months ago but now must share the spotlight with other @entity1 hopefuls on the political left @entity8 transitioned from the @entity151 back into political life without a hiccup , stumping for @entity19 in november with mixed results @entity155 , a @entity19 strategist and veteran of presidential campaigns , told the @entity158 that @entity11 can offer bipartisan appeal to an electorate soured by gridlock in @entity162			1
' whether he can overcome @entity2 's enormous , overwhelming advantage is something that only time will tell , ' he said			0
@entity11 's decision to form an exploratory committee increases the likelihood that @entity8 could position herself ideologically between two other candidates in order to paint each of them as an extremist			1
' with @entity129 on the left and @entity11 on her right , secretary @entity8 may have a perfect opportunity to triangulate , ' @entity155 said			2
the message from @entity11 included appeals to @entity19 who have struggled during the economic recovery and criticized political leaders for being too close to @entity184			1
the former senator also makes the case for a shift in foreign policy that cautions against overseas entanglements			0
@entity11 said the nation faces major obstacles in governing and pointed to domestic and foreign policy items that need to be atop the agenda			0
' we need to put our @entity30 house in order , to provide educational and working opportunities that meet the needs of the future			0
' he noted the stock market has nearly tripled during ' this so - called " recovery " ' while income levels and loans to small business owners have decreased			0
he said the @entity30 needs to ' redefine and strengthen our national security obligations , while at the same time reducing ill - considered foreign ventures			0
' military man : @entity11 ( right , with gen. @entity209 ) is a @entity110 veteran and former navy secretary who held that job for four years in the @entity26 administration @entity11 acknowledged he would face considerable challenges in a presidential bid , saying ' early support will be crucial as i evaluate whether we might overcome what many commentators see as nearly impossible odds			1
' the committee will allow @entity11 to raise money and travel the nation to test the waters for a potential campaign			0
the 68 - year - old vietnam war veteran served as @entity228 secretary under president @entity26			1
he defeated @entity229 sen. @entity229 in his 2006 @entity52 campaign , serving one term			2
in the message , he said he entered the race against @entity229 only nine months before the election and trailed by 30 percentage points before prevailing			0
@entity11 cast himself as an outsider , saying , ' in politics , nobody owns me , and i do n't owe anybody anything , except for the promise that i will work for the well - being of all @entity30 , especially those who otherwise would have no voice in the corridors of power			1
' ' all i ask is that you consider the record i am putting before you , and give me the opportunity to earn your trust , ' he said .			0

hundreds of high - *dollar* @entity8 donors will hear from ' @entity58 ' leaders and @entity19 *luminaries* friday in @entity10
news was *overshadowed* by former sen. @entity11 's launch of a formal committee to assess his chances if he runs against her in the primaries
@entity11 is a @entity110 veteran who was @entity262 under president @entity26 and served a single term in the @entity30 @entity52 from @entity12
@entity8 could use @entity11 as a right - wing foil in the @entity19 primary season , positioning herself as a centrist by *comparison*
