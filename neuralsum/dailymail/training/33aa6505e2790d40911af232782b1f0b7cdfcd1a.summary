' you can not overstate what this means			2
it 's a once - in - a - lifetime opportunity			2
' but he downplayed the suggestion his achievement matched that of @entity3 , who won golds at five consecutive @entity55 , in @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 and @entity60			2
@entity1 added : ' no one will ever beat @entity3 in real terms			1
i mean , to win five consecutive gold medals â€¦ ' i have experienced what it is to do four games , i have no idea what it would be like to do another four years			1
' and there is no way i 'll be back in @entity73			0
' flagging : five - time gold medal winner @entity1 , draped in the @entity75 , becomes emotional as his @entity55 win sinks in proud to be @entity44 : @entity1 soaks up the adulation of the fervent home support inside the @entity36 after his historic win the team broke the world record three times en route to gold , setting new best times in the qualifying heat , the quarter finals and the final			1

they were allowed a restart and scored the fastest time to progress to the quarter finals , breakign the world recording the process			0
paired up with @entity100 in the next round , the trio rode even faster , smashing the world record again , clocking a time of 42.747 seconds			0
the performance capped a remarkable 24 hours for @entity44 cycling after @entity106 became the first man to win the @entity108 and @entity55 gold in the same year with victory in the road time - trial			1
it also took @entity21 's medal haul for the day to six ; three golds and three @entity120 's one of @entity31 's best days ever , but falls short of ' @entity114 ' in @entity115 when they won four golds , a silver and four bronzes			1

but he warned they faced formidable opposition			0
he added : ' the teams are so close that any medal would be an achievement , but that 's not saying we are not looking to win gold			1
' the men 's success made up for the disappointment of @entity44 duo @entity160 and @entity162 's disqualification from the women 's team sprint , after breaking the rules during their changeover			2
the pair had set a world record in the two - woman , two - lap event in qualifying , before the mark broken moments later by @entity174			0
the @entity44 then set the second fastest time in the first round and were due to advance to the final against @entity174 , who set another world record , but officials ruled against them			0
the medal ceremony , and the men 's final were then delayed after one of the @entity174 cyclists stormed off , unhappy with the decision			2
@entity160 will resume competition in the keirin tomorrow , but for @entity162 , who has focused on the starting lap in the event , the @entity187 are over			0
@entity190 were promoted to the final against @entity174 , which they then won after @entity174 recorded the fastest time , but were eliminated because of another illegal changeover			0
@entity194 beat @entity195 to win bronze			2
speaking about her disappointment , @entity160 said : ' we have never had an illegal change , so we were n't really thinking about it			0
it 's just one of those things that happened			2
we were probably just a bit too eager and excited for a ride			0
team effort : @entity11 , @entity10 and @entity1 wave to the patriotic crowd in the @entity36 after receiving their medals @entity1 and his wife @entity209 pose with the gold medal sir @entity1 celebrates victory with his proud wife @entity209 @entity213 lost control of his bike soon after the start of qualyifing fortunately for @entity21 a restart was ordered , and trio stormed to a new world record on the up : @entity31 's gold medal - winning exploits today saw them rocket up the olympic medal table into 5th ' now and again rubbish things happen and this is one of those days			1
the only positives i can take is that i know i am in really good form because that was the fastest second lap i have done			0
i just need to get my head down and concentrate on the races to come			0
' i 'm desperately disappointed for @entity162 because she has done an incredible job in getting this far			0
' her team sprint today was the best of her life so far			0
i 've no doubt she will be back in @entity73 and absolutely smashing it			0
i 'm sorry for disappointing all the people that have come to support us and perhaps not offering the ride that we would have done			0
