a plus - sized model curious about global perception of beauty decided to give her photograph to 21 different editors around the world to see how they would use @entity7 to ' perfect her			2
' @entity9 told the various editors to ' fix ' a woman of her size while upholding the ideals of beauty in their country			1
@entity9 was surprised to discover that in today 's weight conscious world , just three out of 21 editors made her appear noticeably thinner			1
@entity30 : @entity30 altered @entity32 's body weight the most out of all the countries and gave her a noticeably more slender frame and also thinned out her face @entity37 : @entity37 also slimmed down the photograph but left some of the fullness in her face while also giving her rosier cheeks and dressing her in a pink corset top @entity44 : the @entity44 editor slimmed down @entity9 's figure and also gave her a more angular face shape in her blog entry on @entity49 , @entity9 talks about how @entity30 , @entity37 , and @entity44 were the only three countries to drastically alter her weight			1
editors from @entity53 and @entity54 tried to make her appear softer and take away part of her self - described ' double - chin			0
' ' i must admit that when embarking on this experiment , i pretty much assumed that the majority of the editors would quite drastically change my bone structure and weight , ' wrote @entity9			2
one editor from @entity64 refused to photoshop her image at all because they did n't believe in digitally altering photographs			1
' i do n’t believe in re-touching a person ’s natural beauty , ' said the editor			1
the most changed aspect of each photograph was her hair and makeup			0
@entity53 : editors from @entity53 softened her figure and also edited away some of the fullness from her chin @entity54 : editors from @entity54 also softened the appearance of her face , minimized some of her chin , and added a flushed cheek and rosy pink lips @entity64 : ice ; and refused to photoshop the image because they do n't believe in altering natural beauty ' if i was to try to find some correlations between all of them , the closest thing to a common thread would be the changes in hair and makeup			1
from pink lips to overly - blushed cheeks to intense and striking eye shadow ( @entity99 , i kinda like what you did there ! ) , ' she said			0
most @entity7 artists edited out her mole , a feature she likes to accentuate because of @entity107 's iconic facial staple			0
' maybe this eradication of the mole signals that any kind of blemish — even a natural beauty mark — just does n't fit in with standards of perfection , ' she said			2
@entity115 notes that her hair transformation was very varied among different countries			0
' @entity118 , @entity119 and @entity120 all did pretty unusual and striking things , ' she wrote			0
@entity99 : @entity99 did n't do much to alter @entity32 's frame but they added some dramatic makeup to give her a more glamorous look and even left the mole on her face @entity118 : @entity118 gave @entity32 lighter and longer hair and paired the look with neutral toned cosmetics @entity119 : @entity119 handed in two vastly different photoshop images to @entity9 's surprise @entity120 : like @entity119 , @entity120 had two varying interpretations of beauty when editing the photo @entity136 : @entity136 darkened her skin and gave her more defined cheekbones and a more slender nose she noted that femininity is n’t defined the same way in every country and that in some edits her hair appeared longer and shinier while other edits kept her hair short			1
@entity148 seemed to take a satirical approach to photo shopping when they gave her a short blonde do and a ' chunky , badly placed sweater			0
' @entity9 posed in the photograph wearing merely a towel and editors were given the liberty to dress her any way they pleased			2
@entity9 says she was shocked when one editor asked her if she was ' porn			0
' some countries may have viewed the feminine form as something needed to be covered up while others left her shoulders bare			0
despite the range of edits to her original photograph @entity9 concluded that natural beauty may be making a reappearance			1
' i ’ve always wanted to live in a society in which freckles and moles and double chins and natural wrinkles were embraced , rather than hidden away and caked in foundation , ' she wrote			0
perhaps natural beauty is making a comeback , after all			2
@entity181 : the image from @entity181 has the slightest of changes to the original photograph @entity186 : @entity9 's boyfriend of @entity188 did very little to alter his girlfriend 's natural beauty @entity148 : @entity148 may have taken a satirical approach to @entity192 with this paper - doll like rendering @entity195 : @entity195 gave @entity32 a warmer complexion , thinned out her face a bit , and gave her redder lips @entity202 : one editor from @entity202 gave her darker redder lips and also added a colorful background to highlight her features while the other dressed her and gave her blue eyes @entity209 : @entity209 gave her tint a more yellow hue and left her make - up fairly natural			1

@entity9 told 21 editors to ' fix ' a woman of her size while upholding the ideals of beauty in their country
@entity30 , @entity37 , and @entity44 were the only three countries to drastically alter her weight
@entity64 refused to *photshop* her image at all because they do n't believe in the practice saying , ' i do n’t believe in re-touching a person ’s natural beauty '
