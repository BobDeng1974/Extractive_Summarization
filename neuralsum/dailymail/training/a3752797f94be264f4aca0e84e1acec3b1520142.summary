officials could not ' conclusively assert ' that the delays caused the deaths , however			0

@entity53 , @entity13 's lawyer , said the former director was ' scapegoated to appease @entity55 ' but was happy the judge did n't find her at fault for any of the allegations of secret wait lists and patient deaths			1
her law firm said in a statement that the judge 's decision set the ' sets story straight			0
' ' @entity13 did not kill veterans			2
@entity13 did not manipulate wait time data			2
the @entity11 ’s preferred storyline has been proven a fabrication , of which the @entity11 was aware the entire time , ' @entity67 & @entity68 said			0
several whistleblowers had accused @entity13 of ordering the manipulations for personal benefit so that she would receive large bonuses from the @entity11 , something @entity13 has steadfastly denied			2
' she was completely vindicated of that , ' @entity53 said			0
the @entity11 also issued a statement in which it touted the many reforms it has implemented in recent months , including reaching out to 4,000 vets to accelerate their care and scheduling many more appointments			2
' we are making progress in improving access to care at @entity4 and @entity11 facilities nationwide , and we are pleased that [ the ] decision today helps us begin to put the leadership failures at @entity4 behind us , ' it said			0
congressman @entity89 , chair of the @entity90 , said that the ruling serves as a reminder that additional employees at the @entity11 who had direct knowledge of and participated in the secondary wait list system must still be brought to justice			1
' while i am glad the @entity97 upheld @entity13 ’s firing , the fact that the ruling did not connect the central figure of @entity11 ’s wait time scandal to any wait time schemes demonstrates a huge problem with the way this case was handled , ' he told the @entity108			1
' additionally , this decision highlights how there are many other @entity112 employees who have contributed to the facility ’s problems			0
it ’s absolutely critical that @entity11 take steps to ensure these individuals are held accountable as soon as possible to the maximum extent under the law			1
' @entity89 also called for a ' detailed investigation ' into whether @entity1 official in @entity122 ' knew about widespread wait time fraud and when they knew it			0
' ' va leaders owe it to our veterans and @entity132 ’s taxpayers to seek answers to these unknowns , ' he said			0
former va director @entity135 resigned in may at the height of the scandal and has since been replaced by @entity138			0
@entity138 said last month that his agency planned to take ' aggressive , expeditious disciplinary action , consistent with the law ' against more than 1,000 @entity11 employees involved in cover - ups of how long patients were waiting to be seen by doctors			1
a judge ruled this week that @entity13 could not be fired from her job at this @entity148 in @entity4 , @entity5 , because of the secret lists and long wait times , saying the @entity11 did not prove that she knew about her employees ' covert system @entity13 's lawyer declined this week to comment to the @entity154 on the allegations that @entity13 had been receiving gifts from a lobbyist ' seeking to do business ' with the va in violation of the department 's policy because of a separate ongoing criminal grand jury proceeding happening now in @entity4			1
the judge for the @entity97 found that @entity13 accepted nine improper gifts from @entity165 , vice president for @entity166			1
the gifts included airfare around the country , notably a trip to @entity17 ' in excess of $ 11,000 for what appears to be six of her family members for an 8 - night stay ' and $ 729.50 for five tickets - and parking - to an august 2013 @entity21 concert			1
the consulting group had clients with government health care contracts or were seeking such deals , and the judge said @entity13 should have known it was wrong to take gifts from such a group			2
' i find it difficult to believe that she accepted over $ 13,000 in gifts from @entity186 over a two - year period ... without knowing what he did for a living , ' @entity10 said			0
the judge also cited an email exchange between @entity13 and @entity186 in which the then - director said ' whoooo hoooo ! ' after the consultant said he was taking care of a marathon trip			2
until @entity13 was fired in late november - more than six months after her hospital came under scrutiny - she continued to receive an $ 170,000 annual salary even though she was on administrative leave			2
a new law passed in the wake of the matter ensures that an offending executive at the @entity11 would be removed swiftly be from a position of power and knocked off the government payroll if similar circumstances were to arise in the future			0
now employees have just seven days to appeal their firing to the the @entity97 , and the board must make its decision within 21 days , confining the entire proceedings to a single month .			0
