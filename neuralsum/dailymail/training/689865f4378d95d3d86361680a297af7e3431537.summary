@entity0 , novelist , producer of the @entity2 's brilliant @entity1 and long - term girlfriend of @entity4 , has written a new book , @entity6			1
it 's funny and clever , a perfectly paced page - turner that delves into family dynamics and manipulation			1
we sit in the corner of a @entity14 club for tea			1
she 's skinny but not slight , wearing a t - shirt with a faded @entity19 emblem and a tweedy jacket			1
she has huge inviting eyes and great skin , and looks nothing like her 53 years			1
because of the complicated people she writes about i was expecting someone more cranky , but she says none of the book is drawn from her personal family experience			1
being the girlfriend of an international celebrity has kept @entity0 determined to succeed on her own @entity0 was one of five children - did she really not draw on that ? ' everyone has bits of dysfunction in their families , but i actually have a very nice , happy one , ' she says			1
' i 'm slightly obsessed with other people 's families			1
if you delve you always find something			1
people always say , " my family is so normal " , and when you poke into them they never are			1
i 'm interested in the horrible things people do to others			1
' i want to know if any of these horrible things have happened to her and @entity4			1
' we 've been very happy for a long time , ' she says			1
' we 're very lucky			1
' they met at @entity53 in 1982 and knew straight away they were the ones for each other			1
@entity0 with @entity56 at the @entity57 in 2009 ' pretty much , yes , ' she says			1
' but it 's not like we met and said , " let 's settle down and stay together forever			1
" we met when i was in my third year , he was in his second			2
we 're the same age , but he took a year out and i did n't			2
' they have n't married			2
' it 's never been important to either of us			2
if one of us had wanted to do it , the other one would have said , " yes "			2
' of course , @entity4 's career has taken off since @entity71 in 2001 , so i ask if she found it annoying that before her success as a novelist ( she was a script editor and producer at the @entity2 ) people thought of her as @entity4 's girlfriend			1
' i still am thought of as that by most people , just not by people who read novels			2
' is that suffocating ? ' not really			2
i always had my tv career and i always knew i 'd do something else			2
it can be grim but it made me think i need to do my own thing			1
it 's that being - one - of - five thing			1
stand up and be counted			2
it fuels my desire to keep doing something			2
' @entity4 has n't read any of her books , she says			1
in fact , ' he 's only read one novel , @entity95			2
one of his best friends persuaded him if he was only ever going to read one book it should be that one			2
he read it , he said it was an amazing experience and he could never top it , so he did n't want to read another one			2
' @entity0 was born in @entity103 in north - west @entity14 but when she was small she moved to @entity104 , where her parents had a newsagent 's shop			1
' they 'd get up at 4.30am , seven days a week			2
i inherited a real work ethic from them but i left college with no idea what to do			2
my dad used to cut out newspaper ads and post them to me in the hope i 'd get a proper job			2
@entity119 toyed with the idea of creating an on screen version of @entity123 's novel foursome ( left ) ' one of them was for what they used to call a girl friday , a runner for a theatrical agency			0
a tiny place with posters on the walls			0
actors , actresses , scripts everywhere			0
i fell in love with it			0
when i left i became a freelance script reader and then a script editor for tv , but you just get bored of the process			0
there 's something lovely about writing a book , doing what you want			0
i love the solitariness of it			0
it 's my natural state of mind			0
' her novels have attracted @entity156 a-listers wanting to option the rights			0
' @entity159 bought an option on the first , getting rid of @entity161			1
i would have loved her to do it but the option ran out			0
@entity119 toyed with the third one , @entity164 , for a while			0
all of them have been through various processes			0
' she shrugs calmly , and there 's a mesmerising stability to her			0
who would n't be frustrated that @entity159 nearly filmed your book ? ' i 'm not good with insecurity			1
i like things to be open and calm			0
if not , i 'm too much of a worrier			0
' in @entity6 the main character , @entity159 , works on a hotel reception desk , a job that 's showy but not very demanding			1
@entity0 , however , says she was always ambitious			1
' from a young age i wanted to do something important			0
@entity159 aspires to an ordinary life in family terms , and i 've never done that			1
you know how girls play with dolls , saying , " i want to get married and have babies " ? i was never like that			0
i 've always put my lack of wanting children down to the fact i come from a big family			0
i wanted to do something that made me stand out			1
' when people reach their thirties they think , " @entity198 , get on with it			0
" it 's like they 're overcome physically with need			0
maybe it 's a biological thing			0
it just did n't happen to me			0
i love kids , i have lots of nieces and nephews , but i never felt the need to have my own			0
you should n't have a child unless you feel you 're going to be a good parent			0
' does she have friends whose children have gone off to college like @entity159 's in the book ? ' no but i do have friends who worry they 'll not be involved in their children 's lives any more			1
i think if you have no kids you do n't have those marked moments and the relationship evolves slowly , not with a big event that makes you think , " what are we going to do now ? " we 're used to it being just the two of us , so we evolve without realising			0
' @entity0 and @entity4 have been together for 32 years after meeting at @entity53 in 1982 she and @entity4 have a house in @entity14 's upmarket @entity229 and an apartment in @entity231 , which they use fitting around his schedules			1
he 's currently working on @entity234 so she 'll go to accompany him			0
' if @entity56 's away for months , i go back and forth			0
we like to be together , otherwise what 's the point ? you 've chosen to be with this person			0
it 's too hard to be apart			0
we prefer to be together if we can			0
' she 's already halfway through her next book - about a woman who tries to get her assistant to honey - trap someone she suspects is being un-faithful			1
i wonder if that 's borne out of her insecurity that @entity4 's cheating on her ? ' no , ' she laughs			1
and we agree that he 's the least honey - trappable person on the planet			1
but she admits , ' i 'm not good with insecurity			0
i like things to be open and calm			0
if not , i 'm too much of a worrier			0
