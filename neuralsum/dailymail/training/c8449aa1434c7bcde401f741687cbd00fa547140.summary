it was one of the boldest plans of the @entity2 , the biggest airborne operation in history			1
nine thousand @entity5 and @entity6 tropps , dropped from the skies in a valiant bid to seize control of eight bridges in @entity11 occupied @entity12			1
but the battle of @entity14 - later immortalised on screen in the 1977 film @entity16 - was to prove too much for @entity5 forces , who were overcome by an elite enemy force			1
now , a desperate telegram calling for reinforcements - sent from major general @entity22 on the front line to his commander lieutenant general @entity24 - has come to light			1
the telegram that spelt the end of the doomed @entity27 has come to light nearly 70 years later @entity30 ' @entity29 ' ( the @entity31 ) was too much for @entity5 forces , who were overcome by the enemy 's forces brave @entity5 paratroops at @entity36 , @entity12 , september 1944 , in the battle for @entity14 the message was dated 9.14pm september 24 , 1944 , and few copies of it were made			1
after receiving the note , it was decided the 1,900 @entity5 paratroopers left standing at @entity14 should withdraw			1
they were successfully evacuated across the @entity44 under the cover of darkness - and the noses of the @entity11 24 hours later			1
it was @entity50 - husband of author @entity51 - who coined the phrase ' a bridge too far ' when assessing the reasons for the overall failure of the operation			1
the @entity6 troops had dropped into occupied @entity12 to break into @entity11			1
major general @entity22 , pictured outside his headquarters , and the men of the @entity60 , held a shrinking bridgehead at the @entity44 for nine days @entity29 's architect , @entity62 ( above left ) , and lieutenant general @entity24 , who coined the phrase ' a bridge too far ' ( and husband of author @entity51 ) the plan was for paratroops to take and hold valuable bridges - seizing them before they could be destroyed - while a column of armoured vehicles and reinforcements broke through enemy lines and used the bridges to drive into the heart of @entity11			1
@entity78 and his men held a shrinking bridgehead at the @entity44 for nine days and faced a hopeless situation as ammunition ran out			2
his radio message , through @entity50 , was for @entity84 - the architect of the operation codenamed @entity29			1
in the message @entity22 warned that the remainder of his dwindling ranks faced ‘ complete disintegration ’ unless reinforcements did n’t come quickly			2
the message fatefully reads : ' all ranks now exhausted			2
lack of rations , water , ammunition and weapons with high officer casualty rate			0
@entity5 prisoners captured in the suburbs of @entity14 , september 26 , 1944 thousands of @entity5 airmen were dropped from the skies in a bid to seize control of eight bridges in @entity11 territory out of the 9,000 @entity5 men , who were meant to hold @entity106 from the @entity11 for three days before being reinforced , 1,174 were killed and 6,000 were captured ' even slight enemy offensive action may cause complete disintegration			1
if this happens all will be ordered to break towards bridgehead rather than surrender			0
' have attempted our best and will do so as long as possible			0
' ' so not to damage the @entity114 ’ morale anymore than it had been , he ended the message : ' not for general distribution			0
' out of the 9,000 @entity5 men , who were only meant to hold @entity106 from the @entity11 for three days before being reinforced , 1,174 were killed and 6,000 were captured			1
the telegram was handed by @entity84 to his adjutant officer , captain @entity118 , who retained important and historic documents from the war in his own archive			2
@entity16 : @entity122 starring as major general @entity22 , commander of the @entity60 in @entity12			0
the 1977 film , directed by @entity124 , graphically depicted the heroic failure of @entity29 captain @entity118 ’s father was captain @entity118 , who is one of only three people to be awarded a @entity129 twice			0
the bold @entity130 , to get across the @entity44 and into @entity11 - involved the seizing and holding of several bridges in northern @entity12			1
thousands of paratroopers were dropped over @entity134 , @entity135 and @entity14 to take the bridges , while the @entity137 ( @entity138 ) made its way along a 60 - mile road to link up with them			1
@entity14 was the furthest point from the tank division and thus proved to be ‘ a bridge too far ’ , a term coined by lieutenant general @entity24			2
the main problem the @entity5 men faced was the unexpected encounter of two elite @entity11 panzer tank divisions that happened to be resting in @entity14			1
the operation was immortalised in an epic all - star movie that starred @entity122 as @entity22 and @entity152 as @entity24			2
@entity153 , @entity154 , @entity155 , @entity156 , @entity157 , @entity158 , @entity159 and @entity160			0
captain @entity118 ’s daughter has now made the document available for sale at auction			0
the 15ins by 11ins piece of paper has previously been stuck to a piece of card and on the reverse is a signed photo of @entity84			0
@entity172 , of @entity173 ’s of @entity174 , @entity175 , said : ' it is n’t the most valuable document but it is very historical			0
' it spells out in black and white the grim and hopless situation the @entity5 found themselves in			0
' this was one of the last radio dispacthes to come out of @entity14 and it was a ‘ come and get us or we ’ve had it ’ message			2
' the men staged a rearguard action for as long as they possibly could before the decision was taken to evacuate them in absolute silence and under the cover of darkness			0
' it was only when the @entity11 woke up the next morning that they realised the @entity5 had gone and had left behind the wounded			2
' the message was sent from @entity22 to @entity24 , who was in overall command of the @entity199 and had his headquarters close by in @entity12			0
' there could n’t have been many copies of the radio message made up			0
one for @entity24 and one for @entity62 but not many more			0
' the document has a pre-sale estimate of £ 400 and is being auctioned on november 6 .			0
