@entity0 needs to know sooner rather than later whether @entity1 , @entity2 and @entity3 will commit their future to @entity6			1
saints know all too well what can happen when a club their size flourish , having experienced an unparalleled talent drain last summer			2
@entity12 qualification would surely avoid such a scenario this time around , although @entity0 has highlighted the importance of tying down their key assets before the end of the campaign			2
@entity0 wants to know what his key players are intending to do for next season @entity1 ( centre ) is on loan at @entity6 from @entity24 and has been impressive right - back @entity3 has been a revelation and has reportedly been interesting @entity27 @entity2 and @entity1 have been tremendous since joining on season - long loan deals from @entity29 and @entity24 , respectively , and @entity6 have the option to make both moves permanent			1
' we would like to know fast what the player likes , if there is any possibility to buy that player , and that 's in the case of @entity2 and @entity1 , ' manager @entity0 said			1
' of course , we do n't put exactly a deadline on it but we would like to know it soon what the plans are of the players			0
' if it is yes and we can do the deal , then fantastic			0
' if not , okay , then we need other players or we have to think about , that we have players in the under - 21s who can play in those positions			0
' i think that it is important that the club is growing , the team is doing very well and the players are very happy			0
' they have got the possibility to play in the case of @entity2 and @entity1			1
i think we have good possibilities to sign them players			2
' it is not just those on loan that @entity0 needs to persuade to stay , with several key players approaching the end of their contracts			2
left - back @entity2 is on loan at the club from @entity29 and @entity0 would like to keep him at @entity71 's the @entity72 has given @entity73 a week to extend his deal past the end of the season , while he is aware that @entity77 and @entity3 are amongst those out of contract next year			1
the former 's recovery from a ruptured anterior cruciate ligament lessens the need for that deal to be struck , although getting @entity85 right - back @entity3 to promptly sign a new contract is key			1
' yeah , [ we are still waiting to hear ] , ' he said of the extension offered to @entity3			2
' it is a little bit the same as we would like to know what the player is doing because it all influences the plans with what we would like to do			0
' they are important players in the club , like in the case of @entity73 , as well as @entity1 , @entity2 and @entity101			1
@entity73 ( right ) has been offered a new deal at @entity6 , which he is yet to sign ' we try to do our maximum to keep these players because they are good players and still at a good age to develop			1
' this month ? no [ we do n't expect an answer from them ]			0
we do n't make that pressure on the players , but they ca n't wait until april			0
' in - between the end of the month and april , there is time , but i think it is a little bit of loyalty between player and club			0
' okay , we hope that they will stay but we respect every decision and we would like to know it			0

@entity0 wants to sign @entity1 and @entity2
he also hopes @entity3 will ignore @entity27 's interest
