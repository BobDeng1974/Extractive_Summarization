by @entity0 published : 18:03 est , 14 january 2014 updated : 18:18 est , 14 january 2014 the @entity2 is planning to use £ 740 million from the licence fee to fill a giant £ 2 billion hole in its pensions scheme			1
a new valuation has revealed that the deficit in the @entity9 ’s pension fund has almost doubled from £ 1.1 billion in 2010			2
but instead of asking staff to help plug the gap – a request which previously led to strikes and prime - time programmes taken off air – the @entity2 will take a large slice from the taxpayer - funded licence - fee to foot the bill over four years			1
black hole : the @entity2 is planning to use £ 740 million from the licence fee to fill a £ 2 billion gap in its pensions scheme at about £ 185million a year , each top - up is nearly twice the annual budget of @entity24			1
the figures , published in a report by the @entity2 ’s independent pension trustees , mean around £ 7.36 of every household ’s £ 145.50 licence fee now goes towards the pension deficit			1
but rather than release the embarrassing figures publicly , the @entity2 published them only in an internal email to its staff , prompting accusations it wanted to hide the bad news			0
mp @entity37 said the @entity2 should have been ' accountable ' and made the announcement publicly last night @entity40 mp @entity37 said : ‘ it says it all about how the @entity2 operates that this huge black hole in its pension fund was announced internally , rather than @entity9 being open and accountable to the public who will have to foot the bill			2
’ similar to public sector workers , many @entity2 staff had a generous final - salary scheme that guaranteed a pension based on the length of service and earnings at the end of their careers , but it was closed to new staff in 2010 amid concerns over the mounting deficit			2
the @entity2 has already faced criticism that it is overstaffed and bloated with managers			0
a @entity64 request in 2011 found that out of 4,500 staff on permanent and fixed - term contracts , 2,000 had the word ‘ manager ’ included in their job title			2
it also has 8,000 journalists – vastly more than the rest of @entity74 put together			0
between now and 2017 , the @entity2 will have to pump an extra £ 365 million into its pension fund on top of £ 375 million it had already agreed to pay			1
however , the @entity2 yesterday said it had anticipated the increase in its pension deficit two years ago , and took the increased payments into account when making its current financial plans			0
this meant that programme budgets are unaffected by the additional payments from the licence fee			1
the @entity2 ’s generous pension arrangements have been a source of contention for years			0
some of those who have benefited from huge @entity2 pensions include former deputy director general @entity90 , who walked away with a £ 3.4 million pension pot – on top of a £ 1 million severance payment – when he was made redundant in 2011 , and radio chief dame @entity94 , who retired in 2008 with a pension pot worth £ 3.9 million			1
lucrative : those emerging from the @entity2 with multi-million pound pension pots included former deputy director general @entity90 ( £ 3.4 million ) and former radio chief dame @entity94 ( £ 3.9 million ) the last pension valuation , in 2010 , led to protracted industrial action after the @entity2 asked staff to accept lower benefits and higher contributions			1
when negotiations with unions collapsed , journalists and technical staff left their posts , forcing flagship programmes including today and @entity110 off the air			0
last night , @entity2 insiders said the deficit had been caused by low interest rates and an increase in the life expectancy of pension holders			0
a @entity2 spokesman added : ‘ we have agreed a sensible and affordable plan to address the deficit , without adversely affecting programmes or pension scheme members			0

corporation plans to use £ 740 million from licence fee to plug the gap
previous *attempts* to make staff pay led to strikes and cancelled shows
annual top - up comes to almost twice the cost of @entity24
huge pension pots include one of £ 3.9 million to former director of radio
