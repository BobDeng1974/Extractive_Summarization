by @entity0 authorities missed eight chances to act before a teenager obsessed with knives brutally stabbed his mother 94 times , an inquiry has found			2
@entity8 , then aged 16 , killed mother - of - three @entity9 , 42 , at a flat in @entity11 , @entity12 in july 2012			1
the teenager was sentenced to 15 years ' detention after being found guilty of her murder			2
following miss @entity9 's horrifying death , an inquiry found that numerous agencies had chances to intervene in the pair 's fragile relationship			1
the findings by the @entity23 suggested that doctors , police , social services , mental health services , and even teachers should have stepped in when different problems , including violence and neglect , were flagged up			0
missed opportunities : @entity9 , 44 , was stabbed to death by her son @entity8 in @entity11 , @entity12 , in 2012 officials suggested that there were ' lost opportunities ' in the lead up to miss @entity9 's death and it was vital to ' learn lessons '			1
records by various agencies also showed that since the age of 11 , @entity8 had been aggressive towards his mother nine times			2
during the 2012 trial , @entity46 heard that @entity8 had spent two years alone in his room , watching horror dvds , after he had been expelled from school			1
the jury heard that @entity8 attacked his mother in the flat they shared before he lied to police , saying she had been killed by drug - dealers			1
the report revealed that @entity8 should have been referred for psychological testing , been monitored more closely a school , and had his past experiences of domestic violence examined more closely			1
it added that from the age of 13 until the murder , @entity8 had been arrested a number of times , told @entity67 staff at a walk - in centre he was having ' regular sex ' with a partner and would drink vodka and cider			1
at home , he was said to have been damaging property and was abusive to his mother , although not violent			0
the eight - day trial at @entity46 in 2012 heard attacked his mother in the flat they shared before he lied to police , saying she had been killed by drug - dealers the publication concluded : ' this is an extremely tragic case for all concerned and it is important that all possible steps are taken to learn lessons and improve practice in the future			1
' the overarching conclusion must be that it would have been impossible to predict accurately that @entity87 ( miss @entity9 ) was at risk of being murdered by @entity89 ( @entity8 ) , and that practitioners generally acted in good faith within their current knowledge base and work environment			1
' however , there were lost opportunities to act differently and lessons that can be learnt which should improve the response to similar situations in the future			1
' in the case of @entity89 there is little indication that his early childhood experiences were explored in sufficient depth in order for his current behaviour to have been interpreted in the light of this understanding			1
' had this been done there may have been more of a focus on his mental health and the need to move beyond short term approaches towards sustained change over time			0
' psychological testing after his arrest revealed that @entity89 has an iq of 69 - 79 , placing him within the category of borderline learning disability			0
' the lack of referral for psychological testing at school meant that there was insufficient attention paid to meeting his specific learning needs			0
... although there were many agencies and services working with both the mother and son , it appears that there was not one particular service or agency that looked at the whole picture @entity143 , chairman of @entity12 ’s @entity144 ' the focus appears to have been mainly on his behavioural problems rather than exploring ways in which he could be appropriately supported to achieve at school			1
' the result appears to be increasing frustration on the part of @entity89 , who ultimately opted out of education			0
' @entity155 could have potentially played a more proactive role in services to the family and there is little indication that they were actively engaged with the plans for work with @entity164 ' this may have been more likely had the school nurse read @entity89 ’s records prior to contact with him , since his current alcohol issue would have been understood within a broader context , including @entity89 ’s angry and abusive behaviour towards his mother			0
since the review began , agencies across the county including @entity175 , local healthcare organisations and @entity177 have all made changes to their services to try and minimise the chance of such a tragic case happening again			0
councillor @entity183 , chairman of the @entity23 , said : ' this was a very tragic case and i ’d like to express our condolences to the family			0
' the review , which examines the circumstances of this case and agencies ’ involvement with the family , allows us to look at how organisations work with families and highlight where lessons can be learned - in particular , improving agency knowledge of , and response to , parental abuse			2
' we want to create safer communities , so it is vital that victims of domestic violence , their friends , family and the wider community report abuse to the police or some other local agency			2
' findings : the report published by @entity214 's @entity23 suggested eight steps should have been taken which could have helped prevent miss @entity9 's death @entity143 , chairman of @entity12 ’s @entity144 , said : ' although there were many agencies and services working with both the mother and son , it appears that there was not one particular service or agency that looked at the whole picture			1
' since this devastating case , agencies have been working very hard to address the areas highlighted in the review and change the way they operate to make sure the right information is shared with the right people , at the right time , to reduce the risk of a similar case happening again			0
' @entity177 has already made changes to its social care assessments and has trained staff to deal with more complex family situations			0
the council has also made sure that young people who are not going to school regularly , and who are not being seen by a professional , are subject to a multi-agency planning meeting to assess their whole situation			0
councillor @entity248 , the cabinet member for children ’s safeguarding and families , said : ' this was a terrible case that was extremely distressing for the family involved			0
' although such cases are very rare , it has made us review how we support families , particularly with teenagers , find new ways to work with those that are harder to reach and improve the way we respond to the more complex cases			0
' we are committed to supporting children , young people and their families across @entity12 , and are doing everything in our power to minimise the chance of such a tragic case happening again			2
