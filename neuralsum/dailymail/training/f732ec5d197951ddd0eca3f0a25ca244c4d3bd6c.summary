but the @entity1 powerful sovereign wealth fund did not pay any stamp duty on the purchase after employing complex tax avoidance methods			1
the loophole enables buyers to avoid paying stamp duty on a property they are buying by transferring it to a trust at the same time as they complete the sale			1
in doing so , @entity37 said ‘ they attempted to eliminate all of the stamp duty land tax due on the purchase of the barracks ’			1
the @entity1 claimed they had done this for commercial purposes , and not to avoid tax , but their argument was yesterday rejected by the courts			1

this is more than half the value of the entire @entity84 , a wealthy portfolio of and buildings and property which funds the @entity89 ’s expenses			0
only last week , the @entity74 bought the @entity91 headquarters in @entity92 for about £ 1.1billion after fending off @entity94 rivals			2
@entity95 , of @entity96 , said provisional data suggested the @entity1 had been ‘ the largest commercial property investor in the @entity12 this year ’			2
and the sovereign wealth fund is set to make even more when it builds hundreds of homes on lucrative land at @entity4 , in central @entity77			0
the @entity74 bought the barracks for nearly £ 959 million – originally in partnership with @entity105 ’s @entity104 – but bought out @entity104 ’s share in 2010			0
plans to build modernist towers on the site was axed after prince @entity110 wrote an emotional letter to @entity1 ’s prime minister claiming the designs ‘ made my heart sink ’ and would be a ‘ gigantic experiment with the very soul of our capital city ’			2

even your @entity78 – we took it			0
’ the @entity1 are the latest in a long line of businesses and sovereign wealth funds accused of avoiding @entity12 tax			2
@entity145 , @entity146 , @entity147 and @entity148 have all been accused of shirking their full tax liabilities through complex avoidance schemes			0
@entity151 , financial secretary to the treasury , said : ‘ @entity37 ’s position in this important case has now been backed twice by the courts			0
‘ the message is clear – tax avoidance is complex , expensive and self - defeating			1
’ a further 24 businesses and 900 homeowners who used a similar method to avoid their tax responsibilities will also now be told to pay up , which could net taxpayers another £ 85million .			2
