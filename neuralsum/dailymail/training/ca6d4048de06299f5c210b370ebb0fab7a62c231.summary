dolphins may have been swimming the @entity2 â€™s oceans for six million years longer than previously thought , suggests a new study			1
they are the most diverse family of living marine mammals and include species such as the bottlenose dolphin and the killer whale			2
however , their early evolution and fossil record has been steeped in mystery due to lack of good specimens			0
scroll down for @entity15 of the skull a new study has revealed that modern dolphins , like the bottlenose dolphin pictured here , have ancient ancestors that span back up to 13 million years			1
this is six million years further back than the first dolphins were thought to be alive now a new study , published in the @entity25 , has re-described the oldest species of dolphin with a new name : eodelphis kabatensis			1
bottlenose dolphins typically live in pods of 10 to 30 members , but group size varies from single individuals up to more than 1,000			0
their diets consists mainly of fish , which they hunt together or individually			0
dolphins search for prey primarily using echolocation , which is similar to sonar			0
they emit clicking sounds and listen for the return echos to determine the location and shape of potential prey and other interesting items			0
research on bottlenose dolphins has examined mimicry , use of artificial language , object categorization , and self - recognition			0
they can use tools - known as sponging - and pass cultural knowledge down generations			0
although the partial skull was previously described in the 1970s , researchers behind the new paper say the scientific community largely overlooked it			0
and the new re-description has important implications for the evolutionary history of dolphins			1
the skull of @entity71 was originally collected from a small tributary of the @entity73 on the island of @entity75 , @entity76			2
researchers working on the specimen have narrowed its age to the late @entity82 period , 13 to 8.5 million years ago , making it the earliest true dolphin species described			1
lead author of the new study said lead author @entity87 said : ' the early evolution of true dolphins is still covered in mystery			2
' @entity92 kabatensis informs us about the morphology of early dolphins			1
' this is a computer - generated @entity97 image of the single fragment of the skull that was found			2
@entity92 is an important link in the evolutionary history of dolphins that provides correlation between the fossil record and molecular - based studies ( credit : @entity87 ) the discovery was made by studying a skull of an ancient species of dolphin now known as @entity71 , which was collected from a small tributary of the @entity73 in @entity75 , @entity76			1
pictured is the skull recreated around the holotype , the sole ' piece ' of the dolphin scientists have @entity92 is an important link in the evolutionary history of dolphins			1
prior to the latest study , there was inconsistency between the fossil record of the dolphins and molecular - based studies			2
the oldest true dolphin fossils found were less than six million years old , while molecular studies suggested they originated and started to diversify between nine and 12 million years ago			1
@entity127 , a marine mammal paleontologist at the @entity129 , said : ' eodelphis kabatensis , being discovered from sediments that were deposited eight to 13 million years ago , has largely resolved this discrepancy and provides the best glimpse yet of what the skull of the first dolphins may have looked like			1
' in addition to its importance as the earliest true dolphin , the new study also incorporates the most comprehensive analysis of the relationships within the @entity143 , the group that encompasses toothed whales			0
by including @entity92 in the analysis , the researchers were able to get a much clearer picture of the evolution of the toothed whales			0
and dr @entity127 said the presence of @entity92 in the @entity151 during the late @entity82 has implications for the geographic history of dolphins			2
he said that while more specimens need to be discovered , the study suggests that dolphins might have had their origins in the @entity151 .			0

studies of a skull fragment have revealed it to be from an ancient dolphin
research was led by @entity87 of the @entity166 in @entity76
the fossil was first found in 1970 but its origin has only just been revealed
it belonged to a species of dolphin that existed up to 13 million years ago
the finding makes dolphins 6 million years older than previously thought
@entity92 kabatensis the species is an important evolutionary link
