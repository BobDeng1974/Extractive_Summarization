by @entity1 reporter published : 06:26 est , 28 december 2012 updated : 06:26 est , 28 december 2012 the common assumption that a @entity4 tipple is good for you may be wrong for most @entity6 the common assumption that a couple of glasses of wine are good for you may be wrong for most @entity6 , new research reveals			0
scientists at @entity14 ’s @entity13 have discovered that if you are overweight , far from boosting your heart ’s health , moderate alcohol consumption may actually put it at risk			1
writing in this month ’s issue of the @entity14 and @entity22 @entity21 , dr @entity23 and professor @entity24 acknowledged that previous studies show that a little alcohol may lower your risk of heart disease , while a lot will raise the risk			1
however , the researchers in @entity32 were concerned that the data used in these studies had come from surveys undertaken more than 40 years ago when people were much slimmer than they are today			2
therefore , they believed that the findings may no longer stand			0
dr @entity23 , who is director of policy at the @entity40 in @entity41 and who co-authored the research , said : ‘ we were concerned that the findings from a previous generation may not apply to our modern , fatter population			0
‘ so we revisited the data in the classic @entity49 ( a landmark study which identifies risk factors for heart disease ) , and examined the differences between slimmer and fatter men to see how the @entity56 - shaped curve held up			1
’ the researchers discovered that the health benefits still hold for slim men but not for those with a @entity61 above 27.5			1
healthcare professionals recommend that a healthy @entity61 is between 18.5 and 25			2
the study comes at a time when the latest @entity66 figures show that 42 per cent of men and 32 per cent of women are overweight - they have a @entity61 of more than 25			2
furthermore , 26 per cent of adults in the @entity6 are classed as obese because their @entity61 is more than 30			2
@entity72 alcohol consumption is not good for people with a @entity61 of more than 27.5 research published in @entity75 last year showed that the average @entity61 for adults in the @entity6 is currently 27			1
dr @entity23 said : ‘ in effect , the standard advice about a small amount of alcohol being good for the heart does n’t stack up for overweight men			1
‘ we will need to check other surveys and see if they show the same pattern , and we will need to check the data for women			0
‘ we know that apart from heart disease , other causes of disease are made worse by even small amounts of alcohol , including cancer , diabetes and stroke – the major chronic disease killers , ’ he added			1
‘ for now , the advice has to be that there is no such thing as a beneficial level of consumption , especially if you are overweight			0
’ other recent research has shown that wine could have additional health - giving properties			0
studies have indicated alcohol may raise levels of good cholesterol and be beneficial to blood vessels , while antioxidants in wine are thought to protect arteries			1
cardiologist @entity114 , of the @entity115 , has found that moderate wine drinkers have higher levels of @entity118 , the so - called ‘ good cholesterol ’			1
his study of 3,000 people found that the platelets of people who drank three to six standard measures a week are much less likely to clump together in a way that could cause clotting			0
meanwhile , researchers at @entity129 also found that drinking a large glass of red wine each day could help prevent bowel cancer			2
their research showed that resveratrol , a substance found in the skin of red grapes , has cancer - fighting properties			0
just small quantities of the substance were shown to halve the growth of tumours			0
similarly , researchers at the @entity143 discovered that resveratrol can make prostate tumour cells more susceptible to radiation treatment .			0

researchers have found moderate alcohol consumption may only be good for your heart if you are thin
@entity14 scientists found it increases the risk of heart disease in those with a @entity61 of more than 27.5
*original* studies on the health benefits of alcohol may be *outdated* , they say
