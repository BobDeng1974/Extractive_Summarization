by @entity0 his father is hailed as the greatest racehorse of all time , unbeaten in 14 spectacular outings			0
now meet the family : @entity6 , his thoroughbred mother			0
and a new brother or sister on the way			0
they have nicknamed the little one @entity12 , for the moment at least – and upon his already impressive haunches may rest the chance of securing not just a fortune for his owners , but another place in history for the @entity21 dynasty			1
grandstanding : the foal showed off his confident stride and juvenile physique for the cameras at @entity27 yesterday bidding for the three - month - old foal , sold with his pregnant mother , opened at £ 1million yesterday			1
at a landmark auction in the grounds of @entity27 , he became the first ' @entity34 ' the champion has sired since retirement to be offered at a public sale			1
the three - in - one package sold for £ 1,150,000 – or £ 1,462,800 including premium and tax			1
that works out at more than £ 11 for every minute of @entity12 's 90 - day life so far			1
he was bought by @entity44 , who runs one of the most prominent bloodstock operations in @entity47			0
afterwards he said with some understatement he believed he had bought ' a nice horse '			0
he added : ' it 's a little bit of history			2
' smiling , he looked forward to this time in 2016 , when @entity12 will be ready to race			1
' it will be quite an interesting week , ' he said			0
mr @entity44 also has a famous pedigree – he is the son of @entity54 , the business partner of former @entity56 manager sir @entity55 until they fell out spectacularly over another horse , @entity59			0
@entity12 , the first @entity21 foal to be offered for sale to the public			1
the bay colt is three months old @entity44 with the three - month - old foal , fathered by racehorse @entity21 and mother @entity66 at @entity67 in @entity68 judging by little @entity12 's grandstanding performance yesterday , mr @entity44 landed a bargain			1
with a confident stride , and the juvenile physique that quickly marked his father out as a winner , @entity12 may already have taken his first steps towards becoming a champion			1
was he showing off a teeny bit for the cameras ? ' he knows he 's special , ' stud hand @entity79 told me as she led him around the lawns of the palace orangery			2
' he 's got a real cool dude mentality			2
he 's an absolute joy to be with			2
' @entity21 is rated the best horse ever on the flat and was retired to stud in 2012 , his bloodline is now highly sought - after with @entity12 for his red - carpet style premiere was mother @entity66 , due to give birth next year to another @entity21 offspring			1
two of her previous foals have won races			0
those who know are confident that @entity12 is another good ' un , as punters might phrase it			1
the sale , by auction house @entity99 and the @entity102 family of @entity103 , was held on the eve of @entity105 , as the biggest names in racing gather in @entity68			1
bidding for the three - month - old foal , sold with his pregnant mother , opened at £ 1million yesterday @entity12 was meant to come last on a list of 60 horses , a place he is unlikely to occupy often if he lives up to expectations			1
but organisers brought his lot forward to stop him getting impatient			0
they probably need n't have bothered			0
he simply stole the show			0
@entity119 , owner of @entity121 stud , which bred @entity12 and the awaited sibling , said : ' he 's such a little superstar			1
' he has never been off the farm in his life and here he is , showcasing a sale like this , taking the whole thing incredibly well			2
' he confessed to ' a huge amount of regret ' at selling @entity12 , adding : ' he has the same physical attributes as @entity21 ... just look at the hind quarters			2
' that 's where the engine is , and this is definitely a @entity135 engine			2
' but the best may be yet to come			0
@entity21 took £ 3million in prize money in three years , retiring in 2012			2
well , a sort of retirement – he works six months a year as a stud			0
so far , his prowess off the course has raked in five times in stud fees what he won on the track			0
and if you were a betting man , you would probably take the odds that he 's produced a clear winner to follow in his hoofsteps .			0
