by @entity0 published : 18:35 est , 10 december 2012 updated : 02:49 est , 11 december 2012 older people who feel alone are much more at risk of the degenerative brain disease lonely people are twice as likely to develop @entity6 ’s in later life , say researchers			1
their study revealed a significant link between feelings of solitariness – rather than having no friends – and the risk of having the degenerative brain disease			1
earlier studies have suggested social isolation or lack of personal contact carries an increased risk of dementia and mental decline			0
researchers running the @entity23 of the @entity24 tracked the long term health and wellbeing of more than 2,000 patients without signs of dementia			2
among those who lived alone , almost one in ten developed dementia after three years compared with one in 20 of those who lived with others			0
among those who had never married , similar proportions developed dementia as remained free from the condition , possibly because their lifestyles meant they were not the type to feel lonely			0
when it came to those who said they felt lonely , more than twice as many developed dementia – 13.4 per cent compared with 5.7 per cent			0
it is possible that feeling lonely is actually a signal of mental decline that in turn affects social skills , says the study published online in the @entity51			1
but feelings of loneliness may also be the mark of ' vulnerable ' personality or an expression of a ' frailty factor ' that puts certain people at higher risk of dementia , it says			1
@entity6 ’s is the most common form of dementia , affecting over 800,000 @entity65 , with about 500 cases diagnosed every day			2
one theory is that feeling lonely is actually a signal of mental decline that in turn affects social skills , say the researchers the @entity74 study said : ' these results suggest that feelings of loneliness independently contribute to the risk of dementia in later life			1
' interestingly , the fact that ' feeling lonely ' rather than ' being alone ' was associated with dementia onset suggests that it is not the objective situation , but , rather , the perceived absence of social attachments that increases the risk of cognitive decline			1
' @entity88 , of the @entity89 , said strong evidence suggested the best way to reduce the risks was to exercise , eat well and avoid smoking			0
' as @entity96 approaches , many of us are looking forward to full houses and festive parties , ' she said			0
' however , for others it can be a time that can really heighten loneliness			0
' dr @entity103 of @entity104 , the nation ’s leading dementia research charity , said the findings could have important consequences for society			0
' age still remains the biggest risk factor for dementia , but this study links feelings of loneliness to a slightly higher risk of the condition , ' he said			1
' while such a finding could have important consequences for society , it is hard to determine cause and effect at this stage - feelings of loneliness could be a consequence of the early stages of dementia rather than a contributing factor			2

@entity130 researchers found a significant link between feelings of loneliness - rather than having no friends - and the chances of suffering from @entity6 *'s*
adds to *mounting* evidence that feeling lonely is a unique health risk factor
