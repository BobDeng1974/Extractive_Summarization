by @entity0 , @entity1 published : 18:50 est , 2 october 2013 updated : 18:52 est , 2 october 2013 menacing : private companies have been posting fines through drivers ' doors as they take parking matters into their own hands motorists are facing a new menace after parking enforcement firms switched from clamping to issuing tickets backed up by spy cameras			1
some 2.3million drivers have now been hit with paper fines after clamping on private land was banned last year			1
but so many are contesting the new penalties that the official parking appeals service is struggling to cope with the backlog			1
the @entity20 said cowboy clampers have simply ‘ moved their sharp practices to private parking enforcement ’			1
it says the new parking on @entity26 ( @entity27 ) , set up a year ago to prevent abuses , ‘ appears to be struggling to cope ’			2
in a report out today that exposes the scale of the problem , the @entity20 revealed just 6,913 of the 13,611 appeals submitted by the end of august have been considered so far			0
some 3,361 were decided in favour of parking firms , while drivers won 2,856 cases and the rest remain undecided			1
@entity27 ’s own figures show that between october 2012 and march this year there were 1,537 appeals by motorists and 806 – more than half – were settled in their favour			0
the surge in tickets issued by firms comes 12 months after clampers were banned from operating in private car parks in @entity50 and @entity51 after a campaign by the @entity53 and the @entity20			1
enforcement firms have since switched to operating cameras with automatic number plate recognition to issue tickets to drivers through the post			1
the move has also helped to fill government coffers			0
in just three months this year , the @entity62 earned £ 1.4million by selling the details of more than half a million drivers to parking firms so they can be pursued for tickets			1
today ’s report claims the ‘ surge ’ in the number of parking charge notices are attracting complaints from ‘ @entity72 to the south coast of @entity50 ’			0
and it said there had been ‘ a new and hard - line attitude by private enforcement firms ’			2
' free - for - all ' : @entity20 president @entity78 hailed the end of ' extortionate ' clamping but called for new regulations it added : ‘ with clamps no longer an option now in @entity50 and @entity51 it was inevitable that the number of parking charge notices – private parking tickets – would increase			2
’ @entity20 president @entity78 added : ‘ we are pleased that after decades of clamper extortion their practices have largely been consigned to history			0
however , private parking enforcement remains unregulated and is a free - for - all when even firms signed up to a code of practice breach their own rules			2
’ recent cases include that of @entity99 , an @entity100 administrator from @entity101 in @entity102 , who received a £ 150 parking ticket – which breaches the £ 100 maximum recommended by the @entity105			0
she said she had seen no warning signs and felt ‘ threatened and intimidated ’ into paying the £ 75 minimum within 14 days to the firm @entity108			0
the @entity62 earned £ 1.4million in three months this year selling drivers ' information to private firms for fines in another case , a diabetic was fined for sleeping beyond the two - hour limit at a deserted motorway service area after concerns about his blood sugar level			1
the @entity105 ( @entity119 ) confirmed that @entity120 was one of its members but said the firm was ‘ under investigation ’ for parking charges that breached its guidelines			0
however , the @entity105 admitted the guidelines were legally ‘ unenforceable ’ and that tougher laws were needed to protect motorists			0
@entity120 , which is registered to an address in @entity131 , was unavailable for comment .			0

@entity62 earned £ 1.4m in three months selling drivers details to private firms
2.3million drivers given paper fines by ' cowboy clampers ' since the change
but appeals service is struggling to keep up with *tumult* of contested tickets
