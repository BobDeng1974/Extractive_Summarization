the @entity1 government agreed to a police request to restrict more than 37 square miles of airspace surrounding @entity4 , @entity5 , for 12 days in august for safety , but audio recordings show that local authorities privately acknowledged the purpose was to keep away news helicopters during violent street protests			1
on aug. 12 , the morning after the @entity13 imposed the first flight restriction , @entity13 air traffic managers struggled to redefine the flight ban to let commercial flights operate at nearby @entity17 and police helicopters fly through the area - but ban others			1
' they finally admitted it really was to keep the media out , ' said one @entity13 manager about the @entity25 in a series of recorded telephone conversations obtained by @entity28			2
' but they were a little concerned of , obviously , anything else that could be going on			0
they did n't want media in there			0
' @entity13 procedures for defining a no - fly area did not have an option that would accommodate that			0
' there is really ... no option for a tfr that says , you know , " ok , everybody but the media is ok , " ' he said			0
the managers then worked out wording they felt would keep news helicopters out of the controlled zone but not impede other air traffic			1
the conversations contradict claims by the @entity74 , which responded to demonstrations following the shooting death of 18 - year - old @entity42 , that the restriction was solely for safety and had nothing to do with preventing media from witnessing the violence or the police response			1
police said at the time , and again as recently as late friday to the @entity28 , that they requested the flight restriction in response to shots fired at a police helicopter			1
but police officials confirmed there was no damage to their helicopter and were unable to provide an incident report on the shooting			2
on the tapes , an @entity13 manager described the helicopter shooting as unconfirmed ' rumors			0
' the @entity28 obtained the recordings under the @entity1 @entity99			1
they raise serious questions about whether police were trying to suppress aerial images of the demonstrations and the police response by violating the constitutional rights of journalists with tacit assistance by federal officials			2
officer : charges have so far not been filed against @entity44 in the shooting of @entity42 blocked : audio recordings show that local authorities privately acknowledged the purpose of the no - fly zone was to keep away news helicopters during violent street protests such images would have offered an unvarnished view of one of the most serious episodes of civil violence in recent memory			1
' any evidence that a no - fly zone was put in place as a pretext to exclude the media from covering events in @entity4 is extraordinarily troubling and a blatant violation of the press 's first amendment rights , ' said @entity133 , an @entity134 staff attorney specializing in @entity136 issues			1
an @entity13 manager urged modifying the flight restriction so that planes landing at @entity140 still could enter the airspace around @entity4			1
the less - restrictive change practically served the authorities ' intended goal , an @entity13 official said : ' a lot of the time the ( lesser restriction ) just keeps the press out , anyways			1
they do n't understand the difference			0
the @entity47 @entity13 manager then asked a @entity152 police official if the restrictions could be lessened so nearby commercial flights would n't be affected			2
the new order allows ' aircraft on final ( approach ) there at @entity25			0
it will still keep news people out			2
... the only way people will get in there is if they give them permission in there anyway so they , with the ( lesser restriction ) , it still keeps all of them out			2
' ' yeah , ' replied the police official			2
' i have no problem with that whatsoever			0
' @entity174 news director @entity173 told the @entity28 that his station was prepared at first to legally challenge the flight restrictions , but was later advised that its pilot could fly over the area as long as the helicopter stayed above 3,000 feet			2
that kept the helicopter and its mounted camera outside the restricted zone , although filming from such a distance , he said , was ' less than ideal			0
' none of the @entity25 stations was advised that media helicopters could enter the airspace even under the lesser restrictions , which under federal rules should not have applied to aircraft ' carrying properly accredited news representatives			1
' the @entity13 's no - fly notice indicated the area was closed to all aircraft except police and planes coming to and from the airport			0
issues : @entity4 police were widely criticized for their response following the death of @entity42 , who was shot by @entity44 on august 9 aerial images of what was happening in @entity4 would have offered an unvarnished view of one of the most serious episodes of civil violence in recent memory ' only relief aircraft operations under direction of @entity74 are authorized in the airspace , ' it said			1
' aircraft landing and departing @entity17 are exempt			0
' the same day that notice was issued , a county police spokesman publicly denied the no - fly zone was to prevent news helicopters from covering the events			1
' we understand that that 's the perception that 's out there , but it truly is for the safety of pilots , ' sgt. @entity219 told @entity226			0
@entity4 police were widely criticized for their response following the death of @entity42 , who was shot by a city police officer , @entity44 , on aug. 9			1
later , under county police command , several reporters were arrested , a tv news crew was tear gassed and some demonstrators were told they were n't allowed to film officers			2
in early october , a federal judge said the police violated demonstrators ' and news crews ' constitutional rights			2
a police captain wanted the no - fly zone extended when officials were set to identify @entity44 by name as the officer who shot @entity42 and because @entity42 's funeral would ' bring out the emotions , ' the recordings show ' here in the @entity1 , police should not be bullying and arresting reporters who are just doing their jobs , ' president @entity248 said aug. 14 , two days after police confided to federal officials the flight ban was secretly intended to keep media helicopters out of the area			1
' the local authorities , including police , have a responsibility to be transparent and open			1
' the restricted flight zone initially encompassed airspace in a 3.4 - mile radius around @entity4 and up to 5,000 feet in altitude , but police agreed to reduce it to 3,000 feet after the @entity13 's command center in @entity267 , @entity268 , complained to managers in @entity47 that it was impeding traffic into @entity25			1
the flight restrictions remained in place until aug. 22 , @entity13 records show			0
a police captain wanted it extended when officials were set to identify @entity44 by name as the officer who shot @entity42 and because @entity42 's funeral would ' bring out the emotions , ' the recordings show			1
' we just do n't know what to expect , ' he told the @entity13			0
' we 're monitoring that			0
so , last night we shot a lot of tear gas , we had a lot of shots fired into the air again			0
it did quiet down after midnight , but with that ... we do n't know when that 's going to erupt			0
' the recordings do not capture early conversations about the initial flight restriction imposed a day earlier , but they nonetheless show the @entity13 still approved and modified the flight restriction after the @entity13 was aware that its main intent was to keep the media away			1
one @entity13 official at the agency 's command center asked the @entity47 manager in charge whether the restrictions were really about safety			0
' so are ( the police ) protecting aircraft from small - arms fire or something ? ' he asked			0
' or do they think they 're just going to keep the press out of there , which they ca n't do			0
