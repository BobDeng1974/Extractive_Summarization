exclusive by @entity1 , @entity2 political editor published : 05:16 est , 12 march 2014 updated : 07:03 est , 12 march 2014 shadow childcare minister @entity4 said part - time staff are treated as lower status employees , despite often working harder working mothers on part - time hours can be better employees because they do not waste time in the office browsing @entity14 or nursing a hangover , a @entity8 frontbencher has claimed			1
@entity16 childcare minister @entity4 called for a change in office culture which means part - timers are viewed as lower ' status ' employees			1
far from being less productive , those working three or four days a week are often squeezing the work of a full - time employee into fewer hours , she added			1
it comes as a new survey shows fewer than one in seven employees in top jobs work part - time			1
unions claim most of the country 's best - paid jobs are ' no - go ' areas for people not willing to work full - time hours			1
official figures show that women working part - time or taking time off to have children means their pay stops rising a decade earlier than men			1
a recent government survey found small firms in particular did not recognise the wider benefits of flexible working to the business			0
but miss @entity4 , who gave birth to son @entity48 in may last year , said she wanted ' champion working mums ’			1
she told @entity2 : ‘ part - timers and people who are on flexible working contracts often are n’t given the same status in the workplace			1
‘ we need to put these issues centre stage because they are incredibly important			0
' they are issues of fundamental inequality			0
we need to show companies and champion more women who successfully are able to manage a career whilst either working part - time or doing that while having children			1
‘ so we can debunk the myths that we are less productive and less successful because we might work three or four days a week as opposed to working full - time			2
‘ some savvy businesses very often find that people working flexibly are more productive because they tend to use their time more effectively			2
’ working mothers are used to juggling multiple demands at home and bring those skills to the office , she added			2
‘ we are not sitting on @entity14 or coming in with a hangover			0
when we are working we are on it – and making the most of every minute of every day because when you are at home with family you have got to be on it every minute as well			0
’ working mothers are better at juggling the demands of life in the office , because they also have to be ' on it ' at home , miss @entity4 said she said employers had to recognise that supporting working mothers was ’ good for business ’			1
‘ it is about retaining a talented and loyal workforce , ’ she said			0
research by the @entity92 showed that two - thirds of the 900,000 employees in the highest paid occupations , such as financial managers and medical practitioners , are male			2
just 6 per cent of chief executives and senior company officials - who earn more than £ 43 - an - hour - work part - time and only one in four is female			1
however the lowest - paid jobs , like cleaners and working in shops , are dominated by women and part - time work			1
@entity92 general secretary @entity108 said : ' young women are more than able to match their male colleagues as they start out in their careers			2
' but too much of their talent and experience goes to waste as soon as they have children and seek greater flexibility in their working hours			0
' employers ' blinkered refusal to allow senior staff to work part - time and flexibly means that many top - paying occupations are complete " no - go " areas for staff wanting to work shorter hours			1
instead , millions of women are forced into low - paying sectors			0
' women earn most before they turn 40 , according to the @entity131			0
their pay peaks in the 30 - 39 age group at £ 533 - a - week or £ 27,726 - a - year			0
however , men continue to see another 10 years of wage rises , peaking in the 40 - 49 age group at £ 638 - a - week or £ 33,176			0
men see their average weekly earnings rise until they turn 50 but women 's pay peaks before they turn 40 , according to the @entity131 the @entity131 said : ‘ this is likely to be connected with the fact that many women have children and the time taken out of the labour market , combined with career choices they make subsequent to this , may impact on their earnings thereafter			2
’ @entity8 has promised to extend free childcare for three and four year olds with working parents from 15 to 25 hours			0
it would also guarantee childcare before and after school for primary school age children			0
meanwhile the coalition is offering free childcare for two - year - olds from the poorest households , and will give a tax break worth £ 1,200 off the cost of childcare .			0
