they might have been forgotten forever			2
but against all odds , 31 undeveloped rolls of film shot by one single soldier during the @entity4 have finally been brought to light			1
along with them : two incredibly moving segments of letters written by the photographer - one a message from hospital , another musing about the meaning of it all			1
the rare materials were discovered at an auction in @entity17 late last year by freelance photographer and old film fanatic @entity19			1
now , after months of work in his makeshift dark room ( kitchen ) , he has developed the entire catalog of 70 - year - old pictures			1
and the results are breath - taking			2
the photographer seemed to be really interested in capturing moments that had kind of a large significance to multiple people			1
' nothing is known about the photographer except that he was @entity58 and had been posted to @entity59 before being sent home due to injury - facts gleaned from his letter written on @entity65 paper			1
each roll was labeled with a location - @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69			1
the images capture soldiers leaving church , waiting for trains , milling around a dock			1
one shot shows women cheering from the railings of a harbor as soldiers on a ship pull in , with the sign ' welcome home ! ' another features militia trampling through thick snow at what appears to be a prison			2
more quiet moments capture the soldiers ' down time , with officers chatting on a dirt track next to a @entity46 van			1
also discovered : two incredibly moving segments of letters written by the photographer - one a message from hospital ( right ) , another musing about the meaning of everything ( left )			1
the two pages were rolled around two rolls of film bundled in a water - soaked bag the rare materials were discovered at an auction in @entity17 late last year by freelance photographer and old film fanatic @entity19 around the world : each roll was labeled with a location across the globe - @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 just another face in the crowd : nothing is known about the photographer except that he was @entity58 and had been posted to @entity59 the anonymous soldier was also sent home due to injury - a fact gleaned from his letter written on @entity65 paper belief : soldiers can be seen listening to a speech aboard a boat and a chef stands out in the crowd in his white uniform looking away global significance : many of the shots are panning landscapes showing all soldiers together , resonating with the global experience amid global turmoil , the anonymous photographer paused to snapshot his colleagues making their way up a deserted road , with mountains behind them and a sole christmas tree in the snow			1
the letters are equally moving			2
the first , typed on a typewriter , muses about self - confidence , religion , and belief			0
it read : ' your greatest problem is yourself			0
you are also your greatest treasure			0
' if you can get yourself determined upon --- find out what you are and what you are for --- -- and if you can discover and develope ( sic ) the elements of value in your nature , your life will take on the beauty of orderliness and your need of the savings bank will be less and less , for you will be your own riches			0
marching on : it seemed the photographer always had his lens to hand to capture every little segment of their journey into @entity169 @entity59 : signs suggest he was in @entity59 when he took this picture near their ' latrine ' ( @entity59 for the toilets commonly used in barracks ) another world : the breathtaking images which have lain undiscovered for 70 years show the eye - opening of a young @entity58 man typical @entity169 square : he had an eye for landscape shots , capturing stately @entity59 buildings that dwarf people into insignificance on the road again : grainy , black and white , and dark , the solitary shots of blackened roads with lone cars offer a bleak insight difficult to develop : with many of the rolls water - damaged , it was hard for photographer @entity19 to develop all of them perfectly standing guard : while soldiers mill around a cabin , the photographer puts it into the context of @entity59 's delicate countryside ' i say if you can , for this procedure takes wisdom , and wisdom is a fruit which ripens slowly			1
' perhaps you are not yet wise ; perhaps you are still incapable of self - analysis ; perhaps youare ( sic ) confused amid the surfaces and appearances of life ; perhaps your code of conduct is of the alleged sages ; perhaps you are disheartened and discouraged --- - even in frenzy of retreat before ( sic ) the things in you ( sic ) life which seem to oppose you and beat you back			0
' but even so , this is but a condition or mood which is not final			0
' the condition will right itself , the mood will pass ! " i 've missed the true meaning , the beauty and real purpose of life --- - and it 's a little too latenow to recapture my youth , or to go back			2
i 'm bewildered , confused to the point that i no longer know what to do with the debris of my life , what to salvage or to discard " ' when logic and reason and all else fails , there is only one thing left --- - to revert oto ( sic ) blind faith			0
' it is just such faith upon which all religion is based --- - the unshakable belief that if one follows the course honest , generous and sincere living , all else will work out @entity250 funeral : crowds gathered in suits and uniform at a @entity169 - looking building for what appears to be a funeral ' belief and trust in @entity259 , therefore , and a determined effort to live according to his will and @entity263 seems to be the only real solution for the turmoil of this world			2
' you 're an atheist anddo n't ( sic ) ... '			0
the following page has never been found			0
later , he wrote a letter home from hospital			0
the beginning of this letter is also missing			0
it starts : ' ... in a way to be back - but my return will also be poignant with regret			0
' i 've always had a lonesome life , dreaming of success and love and happiness i 've never gained , but here in @entity59 i have had a few brief tastes of what life could have to offer to the lucky ones			0
' i am thinking now of @entity289 , and more recently , of lovely little @entity290 , and all the others i have seen over here			0
stepping back : each image offers the bigger picture			0
a boy cycling past the crowd gives a sense of the wider @entity169 context looking on : standing behind his fellow soldiers , the crowd looks out at a ' welcome home ' ship in the foreground , a battleship behind waiting : sitting in the sun , dozens of men rest at a train station waiting to be picked up to move to their next destination idyllic : in the midst of turmoil and devastation , shots like this of a solitary path and luscious trees are a glimmer of joy incredible : these are the rolls of film that were put up for auction in @entity17 at the end of last year and snapped up by an enthusiast ' @entity289 is the loveliest sweetest little thing which ever happened to me , but it is so unfortunate for me that thousands of miles will separate us before the end of the year '			1
many of the rolls of film were water - damaged , making it questionable whether @entity19 could develop them			1
he spent days and nights on end processing them with a cocktail of chemicals before attempting to open each one			0
it is part of his larger project , the @entity340 , aiming to bring to light lost or forgotten photographs			0
the experience , @entity19 explained , has been incredible			1
' when i pull the film out of my film developing tank , i 'm the very first person who has ever seen that picture , ' he said			2
' they 've never been enjoyed , they 've never been remembered			0
and so it almost increases the weight of the importance of that photo because it 's never had those moments			2
' even if the photographer 's not around any more to remember them , we want to reveal the images to the world because the moments in time that were captured on these rolls of film were important to someone at some point			1
' painstaking : @entity19 , of the @entity340 , spent months labeling each roll and working out how best to treat them analysis : @entity19 said he took extra care to determine which rolls had been water - damaged before attempting to develop them experience : he said the feeling was incredible to be the first person ever to see all the pictures developed 70 years later			1
