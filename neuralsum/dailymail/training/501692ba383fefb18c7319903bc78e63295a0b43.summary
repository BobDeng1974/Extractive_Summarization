@entity0 , 24 , of @entity1 , @entity2 , fractured the spine of the infant - now aged two - and broke three of his ribs after attacking him when he was just three weeks old			1
three months later he left the child with multiple bleeds to the brain and cerebral swelling after shaking him in fury , a court heard			1
but @entity0 claimed his other son was responsible for the injuries			1
after a trial at @entity23 in north - east @entity24 the father - of - two was convicted of carrying out two separate attacks on his son			1
judge @entity27 told him : ‘ the victim of this serious assault was your own son - he was not even four months old			1
' you shook him with such violence that the doctor said it must have been repeated cycles of shaking to cause multiple haemorrhages to the brain and cerebral swelling			2
‘ despite overwhelming evidence that all injuries were caused by you , you continued to deny it and persistently blamed your older son - who was only two years old - for the injuries to the brain			1
‘ had you persuaded the jury that he was responsible for those injuries , for the rest of his life he would have to live with the false information that he had injured his younger brother so badly that his life was irreparably changed for the worse ’			2
@entity0 had savagely attacked his son when he was just three weeks old in february last year			1
then on may 19 , he deliberately shook the infant while he was looking after his two sons			2
the baby started vomiting and had to be taken to hospital , said @entity56 , prosecuting			2
doctors then found rib and spinal injuries consistent with heavy blows to the back , the court heard			2
‘ he was left with fractures to the ribs and spine which was only found by doctors after he was examined fully at the hospital ’ , @entity63 added			0
‘ doctors found healing fractures to three ribs and fractures to his spine - compression fractures			0
both sites required considerable force to have been caused by you			0
‘ it is not possible to accurately date when these injuries occurred , but it was three to four weeks before may 19 - therefore when he was only three months old ’			1
recent tests have shown the victim still has abnormalities to the frontal lobe of his brain and that his development has been delayed by his injuries			0
mr @entity101 said further research has to be done to ascertain the long - term impact of his injuries			0
the court heard @entity0 has since been in a relationship with another woman with young children after the mother of his two children left him			0
sentencing @entity0 to eight years behind bars , @entity63 said : ‘ there is a high risk of reoffending if you engage in relationships , as you have done , with women who have young children			1
' there can be no greater position of trust than a parent left in charge of their young baby - and you abused that trust ' judge @entity27 ‘ one thing that emerges from the injuries is that the level of violence you inflicted on your son was quite clearly escalating			0
‘ it is clear to me that you are an intelligent young man and because of that you could not have been unaware that you were hurting your son - on each occasion he would have cried			0
‘ there can be no greater position of trust than a parent left in charge of their young baby - and you abused that trust ’			0
@entity0 had denied charges of grievous bodily harm in respect of the first attack , and grievous bodily harm with intent for the second .			0
