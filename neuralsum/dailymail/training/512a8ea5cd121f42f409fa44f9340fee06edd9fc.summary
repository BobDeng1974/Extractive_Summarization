by @entity0 published : 06:49 est , 29 march 2013 updated : 08:48 est , 29 march 2013 between the choice of reading one of the sweariest cookbooks you 're ever likely to read and ' no coffee , no alcohol , no dairy , no eggs , no sugar , no shellfish , no deep - water fish , no wheat , no meat , no soy and nothing processed at all ' it seems the novice foodies of @entity18 have made up their minds			1
@entity20 , an ebook by journalist and intrepid amateur chef @entity23 , was released yesterday and immediately raced ahead of @entity24 's it 's all good in the @entity26 book charts			1
the book is inspired by @entity23 's popular food blog , the @entity29 , and is a blisteringly honest account of her endeavours in the kitchen the book is inspired by @entity23 's popular food blog , @entity29 , and is a blisteringly honest account of her endeavours in the kitchen			1
it also includes tales of life as a mother to her two - year - old daughter @entity41 and as a wife to restaurant critic @entity43			1
here , to celebrate the launch of her book @entity23 shares her top five tips for ' crap cooks ' like her and a fail safe @entity49 en @entity51 recipe to impress a date			1
' you can either use a decent amount of salt in your cooking or you candie of a ) starvation b ) boredom ' 1 ) do n't rush accept that you are a bad cook and so when you are cooking , make sure you 're not under any time pressure			1
cooking in haste is a guaranteed way of really making a mess of things			2
2 ) try things out it can seem like a waste to make anything more complicated than pasta when it 's just you , but you have to try new recipes out or you 'll never learn and get better - and using yourself as a guinea pig rather than , say a dinner party of 6 , leaves you less open to panic , failure and embarrassment			1
3 ) do n't assume that cooking is easy , because it is n't @entity24 's book has been trumped at least , not for everyone			1
although @entity80 and @entity81 and @entity82 make knocking up dinner a joyous breeze on telly , it 's not like that for the novice cook			1
so when attempting a recipe , follow it to the letter			2
do n't skip any steps , weigh everything properly , use the right - sized dishes and time everything religiously			2
4 ) keep it simple if you want to cook for a lot of people , do n't be afraid to serve up something homely , like spaghetti bolognese or a fish pie			2
and having people over is n't just about dishing up impressive food - just make sure there is plenty to eat and drink and have a bunch of flowers somewhere and everyone will be delighted			2
5 ) @entity110 is the key to cooking an extra pinch of salt can transform a dish from bland to delicious			1
so if your curry is lacking a certain something , your pie seems uninspiring or your bolognese needs a boost , sprinkle over a large pinch of salt and see if that makes a difference			1
intro taken from @entity29 ' i had @entity49 en @entity126 once at someone 's house and it was absolutely disgusting			1
' the cook had failed to use any salt , because they are the sort of person who thinks that any salt kills you stone dead within weeks			1
my view is that you can either use a decent amount of salt in your cooking and run the extremely tiny risk of it doing you some damage , or you can use no salt and die of a ) starvation b ) boredom			1
and get some mean leg cramps in the night			2
' but there 's no reason why @entity49 en @entity126 should n't be a delicious thing			1
it 's wrapped in pastry ! i mentally file this kind of thing under my ' finishing school ' category of cooking			1
quiches and souffles are also filed under this category			2
baked bone marrow and suet puddings are filed under ' new @entity18 , curries and stir - fries go under ' student ' , lemon meringue pie , soup , and devilled kidneys go under ' yuk ' and so on			2
' @entity49 en @entity126 @entity49 en @entity126 is one of those things that seems very complicated but is in fact very easy			0
sliced on the diagonal and served with a simple salad , it looks beautiful and will impress anyone			0
@entity49 en @entity126 is one of those things that seems very complicated but is in fact very easy ingredients : serves 2 2 x salmon fillets			0
it is best to get these from a fishmonger , or at least the fish counter of a supermarket because you need them with no skin on			0
you can skin them yourself , but it is tricky			0
1 x packet of all - butter puff pastry1 egg , beatensalt and pepper1 small bunch dill , chopped - basil will also work here , if you do n't like dill40g butter at room temperature1 tbsp wholegrain mustard method : 1 put your oven on to @entity202 2 now make a paste out of the butter and dill			0
put the butter in a small bowl with a pinch of salt and a few turns of the pepper grinder and then mash in the dill with the back of a spoon			1
3 take your salmon fillets and have a look at how they would fit together , like a @entity220 sign - this is how you are going to sandwich them together before wrapping them in the pastry			0
then spread one side of your salmon sandwich with the herb butter and the other side with the wholegrain mustard , then fit together and set to one side			0
4 put a baking tray in the oven to get nice and hot ( this will help prevent a soggy bottom ... ) 5 roll out the puff pastry until it is about the thickness of a pound coin ( have a look at an actual pound coin , because this is thinner than you think it is )			0
now place your salmon in the middle and bring the pastry up and over it to form a neat parcel			0
trim the ends so there is n't too much of an overlap and tuck it all in , like a present			0
seal all the edges with some beaten egg to help it stick			0
( if you do n't have a pastry brush to distribute the egg , you can just use a finger			0
) 6 turn the salmon over , so that the seam is on the underside			0
make three slits in the top of your parcel to let steam escape and brush all over with beaten egg ( i also sprinkle some sea salt and pepper over the top for decoration )			2
7 now take your hot baking tray out of the oven and brush with a little bit of oil to stop the salmon en croute from sticking			0
you can use a folded square of kitchen towel for this			0
lay your pastry parcel on the baking tray and bake for 35 mins			0
produce to gasps of awe from your date			0
