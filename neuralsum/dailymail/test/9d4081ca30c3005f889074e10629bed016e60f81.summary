he made the headlines for his plan to travel 20,000 miles on 21 flights in first class ... without paying a penny			1
now @entity7 28 - year - old @entity6 has revealed his savvy secrets so you too can explore the world without falling into the ticket traps			1
the @entity13 reporter reveals his travel hacks in his @entity15 , and spoke to @entity16 about his top tips			1
he only sign up for cards with high sign - up bonuses and relatively low spending thresholds necessary to get those			1
for example , a card he just got gave 50,000 bonus points for spending $ 1,000 in three months			0
the writer makes a point of putting all everyday spending on credit cards in order to hit these spending thresholds			1
( unfortunately , this is mostly true for @entity7 travellers ; @entity25 credit cards and elsewhere tend to offer fairly meagre perks			1
) as long as you can handle credit responsibly and treat your credit card like a debit card , you can work towards a surprising amount of free travel			1
my favourite credit card is almost always whichever one offers the best sign - up bonus at the time			1
so right now , the best three are @entity66 ' @entity65 card , the @entity68 card , and @entity70 card , each of which offers a sign - up bonus of 50,000 miles			0
( for complicated reasons , i probably like the @entity74 card the best , because if you 're flying less than 650 miles , 50,000 miles will get you as many as 11 free flights			1
) i basically ignore the ' get one mile for every dollar you spend ' incentive , since i do n't have much money to spend			0
in order to get as many miles as the sign - up bonus , i would have to spend $ 50,000 ! i focus almost exclusively on the sign - up bonus when deciding what card to get next			0
@entity30 uses a number of techniques to travel first class around the world for free , which he has revealed in his two ebooks			1
here pictured in @entity92 fly on the cheapest days of the week be flexible with your dates when you want to take a trip of a set number of days			0
often times a friday - monday flight will be cheaper than a thursday - sunday , for instance , even though it 's the same number of days			0
usually the cheapest days to fly are tuesday , wednesday , and saturday			0
@entity30 poses while rafting down @entity101 which is located near the city of @entity103 in @entity92 check the day before and after for cheaper fares always search one day before or after just out of curiosity , because sometime red - eye flights can technically leave on the next day			1
these flights leave late at night , arriving in early morning and inside the @entity7 these flights are almost exclusively for travel from the @entity111 to the @entity112			1
' i once helped my friend @entity114 cut the price of a round trip flight to @entity117 nearly in half by finding a redeye flight that left just after midnight , making it technically a monday flight and not a sunday flight , ' @entity30 tells @entity16			1
wading into the waters of @entity124 in @entity125 , @entity92 , rock formations and the remnants of old geysers work backwards with your trip if you want the cheapest flights , chase the fare , not the destination			1
in other words , rather than picking a destination and then looking for the cheapest way to get there , start out by looking where there are cheap flights , and then decide among those where you 'd like to go			1
@entity30 explains : ' i never had my heart set on going to @entity146 , but when a $ 65 flight from @entity146 popped up , i jumped on it			0
' that 's too great a deal to pass up , after all			0
' the 28 - year - old having fun wearing a tortoise shell in the @entity153 on holiday search for the whole month for flights refer to websites such as @entity158 and @entity159 which give you an month 's overview of flights a prices			1
make your itinerary as flexible as possible so you are able to opt for going a few weeks after you intended to get the lower fares			0
enjoying the view ! the writer recommends flying on a tuesday , wednesday , and saturday as these are usually cheaper try flying to gateway airports if you 're flying to a different continent and want the cheapest price , you should search for a number of different gateway airports in that region			2
for example , if you want to fly to @entity176 , start by searching for flights to @entity176 , but do n't stop there			2
also look at the cost of flights to @entity182 , @entity183 , @entity184 , @entity185 , and @entity186			2
if any of those flights is significantly cheaper , you can usually find a cheap budget flight from there to continue on to @entity176			2
searching leg - by - leg like this can save hundreds on your overall flight cost because flight search engines usually ca n't combine a long haul flight on one airline with a short flight on a separate budget airline			0

the flyer picks the flight before choosing a destination to visit , to save money @entity205 , @entity207 - @entity206 , @entity208 - 861 miles @entity206 , @entity209 - 935 miles @entity125 , @entity92 - @entity209 - 228 miles @entity209 - @entity210 , @entity211 - 994 miles @entity210 - @entity212 - 507 miles @entity212 - @entity213 , @entity214 - 1234 miles @entity213 - @entity215 217 miles @entity215 - @entity216 's , @entity217 - 131 miles @entity216 's - @entity218 - 1535 miles @entity218 - @entity219 , @entity220 , 4733 miles @entity219 - @entity221 , @entity220 , 304 miles @entity222 , @entity223 , @entity224 , 173 miles @entity223 - @entity225 , @entity226 , 665 miles @entity227 , @entity226 - @entity223 , 356 miles @entity223 - @entity228 , @entity229 , 500 miles @entity230 , 500 miles @entity223 - @entity231 , @entity232 , 587 miles @entity231 - @entity233 , @entity234 , 393 miles @entity233 - @entity235 , @entity220 , 697 miles @entity235 - @entity236 , 4412 miles @entity236 - @entity205 , 240 miles total : 20205 miles do n't book in advance do n't buy domestic flights more than one - three months in advance			1
fares rarely go on sale further than three months in advance , so you 'll miss out on some upcoming deals if you book too early			2
on the other side , do n't wait until the last minute to book			2
unlike 20 years ago , standby fares are mostly a thing of the past and fares tend to shoot up in the final days before a flight actually takes place			0
for popular flight times during the holiday season or for long haul , look six months in advance			0
being bumped is not the end of the world being delayed or bumped from a flight is a situation many travellers fear			2
however it could prove to be in your favour with some airports if you ask for money or frequent flyer miles instead of flight vouchers			0
' i was once given a $ 500 voucher and a confirmed seat on the next flight — an hour and a half later , ' @entity30 wrote in @entity272			0
' in other words , i earned $ 333/hour			0
' like me , if your goal is to fly for free , you probably do n’t make $ 333/hour			2
' @entity278 , unlike flights you book using miles , you actually earn miles when you pay using a voucher			1
' @entity30 is seen posing in front of the famed @entity282 on a previous trip , which straddles the border of @entity285 and @entity286 take advantage of tweet deck and email alerts do n't make flight hunting something you only do when looking to plan your trip			0
constantly be updated with alerts and tweets promoting the cheapest tickets			0
@entity30 recommends the best newsletter alerts are from @entity298 and @entity299			0
you can also sign up to receive emails from the savvy traveller himself for deals he comes across			2
the writer recommends being open to stop off at a gateway airport in a cheaper destination , before continuing with the second leg of your journey to where you want to go			1
