@entity0 , 75 , would have to carry a load of gear like spare trousers , underpants and pads something as simple as having a cup of tea at a neighbour 's house used to be fraught with anxiety for @entity0 , 75			1
and staying overnight at his son 's home was all but impossible			0
a little under a year ago , @entity0 underwent treatment on his prostate that left him , like thousands of other men , suffering from incontinence			1
' it destroys your confidence , ' says @entity0 , a retired chartered engineer who lives near @entity23			1
' i 'd have to carry a load of gear with me - spare trousers and underpants , as well as pads			2
' i 'd dread going round to other people 's houses			0
if you sat down on their furniture , there was the worry you might leak			0
' i used to stay overnight at my son 's home , but then i did n't dare			0
and a holiday was out of the question			0
' it has been isolating for @entity0 , a father of two and grandfather of three			1
' i lost my wife five years ago , and it 's important to keep going , ' he says			2
urinary problems are often the first sign of prostate cancer			2
the prostate is a small gland that sits between the bladder and the penis and surrounds the urethra , the tube that carries urine out of the body			2
in the early stages , prostate cancer is often symptomless , but as tumours grow , they can press on the urethra and / or the bladder , making men feel the need to go to the loo more frequently or more urgently			1
more severe incontinence is a common side - effect of surgery to remove the prostate			1
around 5,000 men have this surgery each year and at least half will have short - term incontinence in the months afterwards , says @entity72 , a consultant urological surgeon at the @entity73			1
men have two sphincters ( rings of muscle acting like a one - way valve ) that keep them dry			1
one between the bladder and the prostate - known as the internal sphincter - and one in the urethra just below the prostate gland			1
' these weaken with age , but in some men the prostate enlarges and reduces leakage by acting like a cork in a bottle , ' he says			1
the internal sphincter sits next to the prostate , so surgery to take out the gland involves removing it , too			2
' men are left relying on the remaining sphincter , ' says professor @entity72			1
' many have a degree of incontinence just after surgery because this can be bruised by the operation			2
' incontinence after surgery is usually stress incontinence			2
here , leaks occur as extra pressure is put on the bladder , for instance , by coughing or laughing			0
in theory , once the bruising has settled down , so will the urinary problems			0
however , two in every ten men will have long - term incontinence that leaves them using pads , according to the @entity126			1
more severe incontinence is a common side - effect of surgery to remove the prostate some , like @entity0 , are left with no control at all - with a near continual stream from the bladder			1
this can occur when key muscles and nerves around the bladder are damaged during surgery , so the bladder contracts when it should n't			0
@entity142 , professor of continence technology at @entity144 , says far more needs to be done to support men practically - with better guidance on products that improve quality of life - and psychologically			1
it 's not only men who have surgery who are at risk - older forms of radiotherapy , using an external beam of radiation , can also lead to incontinence			1
@entity158 , more focused techniques , such as brachytherapy , which places radioactive seeds in the tumour , are thought to have a much lower risk			0
in rare cases , incontinence can be a side - effect of a procedure called @entity169 ( trans urethral resection of the prostate ) , which is sometimes offered to treat an enlarged prostate , a benign condition thought to affect 60 per cent of men over 60			1
@entity169 involves trimming the prostate to widen the gap for the urethra			2
again , this can leave the sphincter damaged - usually temporary , indirect damage from the heat used			2
but problems can persist if the sphincter is damaged during the procedure			2
@entity0 's problems were probably triggered by the radiotherapy he had after being diagnosed with prostate cancer in 1999			1
the treatment worked , and his @entity189 level ( a measure of a protein secreted by the prostate gland , very high levels of which can be caused by cancer ) had been 115 when he was diagnosed , but went down to 0.4 - a healthy level			1
though it started to rise again after four years , it was controlled with hormone therapy and regular scans			0
new incontinence management project , part of true @entity202 , focusses on improving quality of life for men with prostate cancer , funded by @entity207 around three years ago , however , @entity0 started to lose control of his bladder			1
' sometimes , i could n't make it to the loo in time			0
then it started happening all the time , ' he says			0
@entity0 mentioned his problems a few times to his urologist , but it was a year before he was offered pills to desensitise his bladder			1
these , he says , ' worked too well '			0
he was hospitalised with a bladder infection as a result of fluid retention , where he was n't able to pass urine at all			0
he was told that the radiotherapy he 'd had before had made his prostate less elastic and his urologist suggested he have a @entity169 procedure			1
@entity0 knew this could cause temporary incontinence			1
' after a few days , my problems should have settled down - but they did n't , ' he says			2
' i became totally incontinent			0
at the hospital , they gave me a pads , but they were not fit for purpose , as they 're so big and bulky			0
' no one talks to you about what 's happening to you			0
' but a new research project , led by @entity239 , is designed to transform the experience of men like @entity0			1
the incontinence management project , as it is known , is part of a wider programme called true @entity202 , focusing on improving quality of life for men with prostate cancer and funded by the @entity207 charity campaign			1
the first part of the project will be a website offering advice			2
' men can be too embarrassed to ask for this information , ' says professor @entity142			2
' it 's common to see incontinence products for women advertised on telly , but it 's still not talked about for men			1
' indeed , many end up relying on sanitary pads bought for them by their wives			0
but these tend to be rectangular - men need a triangular pad			1
and there are other products to keep men dry			2
' for instance , a clamp ( a cushioned clip that fits on the end of the penis to hold the urethra shut ) can allow men to exercise for a couple of hours , ' says professor @entity142			2
the proportion of men who will suffer bladder weakness at some stage there are also sheaths and external bags			1
these cover the opening of the urethra to collect urine and can be worn inside clothes , strapped to the leg			0
' these devices are available on prescription , ' says professor @entity142			0
' the problem is @entity295 often do n't know this			0
' another option is surgery : to fit an artificial sphincter to keep the urethra closed or a sling that repositions the urethra to take the pressure off the sphincter			0
men taking part in the project will be able to try different devices			1
they will also be involved in designing new products , including a more comfortable clamp and an absorbent , washable pair of boxers to replace towelling nappies many rely on at night			0
and there will be training for health professionals to offer more personal support , including psychological therapies			0
@entity0 is helping the true @entity202 researchers			1
meanwhile thanks to a successful operation to fit an artificial sphincter , he has regained almost total control of his bladder			0
' i get the odd leak if i cough , ' he says			0
' but i can go out again			0
and i was able to stay at my son 's house this @entity327 without worrying			0

@entity0 , 75 , from near @entity23 , underwent treatment on his prostate
op from little under a year ago left him with ' isolating ' incontinence
two in 10 men who undergo procedure will suffer this in the long - term
