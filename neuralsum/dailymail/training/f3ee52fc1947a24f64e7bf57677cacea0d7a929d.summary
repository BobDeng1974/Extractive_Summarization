by @entity0 @entity1 : 10:02 est , 27 december 2013 @entity2 : 10:38 est , 27 december 2013 have you ever fancied yourself as an amateur hacker ? or perhaps a future cyber security soldier defending against malicious malware ? well , maybe your dream could become a reality			1
@entity9 has teamed up with the @entity10 and @entity11 to offer a festive code breaking challenge that will test your skills			1
the game consists of four separate images			1
right click on each image and save it to your desktop			1
after this you ’ll need to use your ingenuity to find a hidden numerical or alpabetical code inside by manipulating the image			1
right click on each image and then click ' save as ' before manipulating it to find the hidden code clue : sometimes things are not always what they appear to be , maybe there is something in the numbers			1
but can you work out how to find the numbers first ? for example , some codes might be revealed by altering the colour and contrast of an image			1
by putting the image through photo - editing software , seemingly impossible codes are fully revealed			1
or another trick might be to convert the image into another format that then exposes the image 's secret			2
whatever happens , the code wo n't be obvious , but given it 's @entity43 , here are a few cryptic pointers : challenge 1 : sometimes things are not always what they appear to be , maybe there is something in the numbers			2
but can you work out how to find the numbers first ? challenge 2 : history has taught us much about enciphering messages ; @entity56 knew a thing or two about this			2
challenge 3 : the polar bear ’s nose contrasts with the bright background , maybe there is something in the colours you can adjust			2
challenge 4 : mr @entity66 and mr @entity67 teamed up to bring you this festive scene , all that is a missing is a festive crib			2
clue : history has taught us much about enciphering messages ; @entity56 knew a thing or two about this challenge 1 : sometimes things are not always what they appear to be , maybe there is something in the numbers			2
b ut can you work out how to find the numbers first ? challenge 2 : history has taught us much about enciphering messages ; @entity56 knew a thing or two about this			0
challenge 3 : the polar bear ’s nose contrasts with the bright background , maybe there is something in the colours you can adjust			0
challenge 4 : mr @entity66 and mr @entity67 teamed up to bring you this festive scene , all that is a missing is a festive crib			0
if you find the codes to the pictures then follow this link and send a message with your answers included , or email them to competitions@cybersecuritychallenge.org.uk using ' @entity110 ' as the subject line			1
the security team will check your answers and confirm if you 've cracked the code			0
the answers and techniques used will be revealed by the @entity10 after @entity43			1
the results will also be seen by the @entity10 sponsors , including organisations such as @entity119 and @entity120 , who are on the look out to recruit the next generation of cyber soldiers			1
a series of similar challenges created by the government - backed organisation have already helped uncover some of the @entity130 ’s most skilled hackers – and talent seems to be found in some of the most unexpected of places			0
one of the @entity10 ’s most successful recruits was a former postman named @entity135 who , after completing a series of online tests , has now become a cyber security professional at the @entity139			1
mr @entity135 , 35 , has a background in it but left the industry to pursue his own business			0
when it faltered , he took a casual delivery job over @entity43 with the @entity139			0
he entered the online competition on the suggestion of his mother and aunt , who had heard about it on the radio			0
clue : the polar bear ’s nose contrasts with the bright background , maybe there is something in the colours you can adjust in a similar challenge held earlier this month , a student working at the @entity161 was crowned one of world ’s most skilled cyber security hacker beating seasoned security professionals all over the world			1
@entity168 , competing under the name ‘ @entity170 ’ , beat over 1,200 cyber enthusiasts from 49 countries in the 2013 @entity173 to become the highest - ranked civilian in the competition			0
although mr @entity168 ’s job involves working with computers , he does n’t directly work in cyber security			1
‘ the only part of my role that requires these skills is when the university staff and students come to me with malware on their computers			0
i ’m able to use the skills i ’ve acquired to remove malicious programmes and make their systems more secure			0
’ clue : mr @entity66 and mr @entity67 teamed up to bring you this festive scene , all that is a missing is a festive crib cyber warfare has today become one of the greatest threats to @entity130 ’s national security , according to recent government reports			1
@entity200 , the director of the @entity119 ( @entity119 ) , said @entity130 government systems are targeted 1,000 times each month			2
’ cyberspace is contested every day , every hour , every minute , every second			0
i can vouch for that from the displays in our own operations centre of minute - by - minute cyber attempts to penetrate systems around the world			0
the threat is a real and credible one			0
’ last @entity43 cyber criminals made £ 12 million from online fraud in the @entity130 and it security experts are warning shoppers that unless they take precautions thieves will be in for a bumper haul again			2
between november 1 2012 and february 28 @entity221 received 11,161 reports of online fraud , with the average loss to each victim being £ 1,700			0
these crimes netted cyber criminals some £ 12 million			0
the @entity43 fraud figures run to march because for many online festive shoppers , it 's not immediately apparent that they 've been fleeced			0
the government , working alongside the @entity10 , is currently on a recruitment drive to identify future cyber security soldiers			1
after testing your skills against these challenges , @entity119 may just want to track you down .			2

the challenge consists of four separate images . you need to right click on each image and choose ' save as '
you can then manipulate different settings on the image , such as colour , to reveal hidden codes
email the codes to competitions@cybersecuritychallenge.org.uk using ' @entity110 ' as the subject line
the results will be seen by the @entity10 sponsors , including @entity119 and @entity120 , who are on the look out to recruit the next generation of cyber security soldiers
