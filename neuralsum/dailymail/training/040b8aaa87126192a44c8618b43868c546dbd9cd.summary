@entity0 has asked the @entity1 to start drawing up plans to levy its mansion tax on 100,000 expensive homes from day one of regaining power			1
despite a revolt from some @entity9 over the new annual levy , shadow chancellor @entity7 said he aimed to hit better - off homeowners in the next financial year			1
it is unusual for a tax to be introduced in the course of a financial year , but mr @entity7 said he wanted to start raising money from the rich in order to plough into the @entity20 as quickly as possible			1
@entity21 and the shadow chancellor @entity7 have vowed to introduce a mansion tax on ' day one ' of a @entity24 the shadow chancellor said @entity1 officials were already working on the proposals , in line with the civil service ’s practice of making plans to implement the policies of parties that could win a forthcoming election			1
@entity0 and @entity35 plans for a mansion tax had been in doubt after @entity39 ’s dramatic reform of stamp duty at the autumn statement , which have made buying a home worth £ 1 million or more far more expensive			0
@entity44 dem business secretary @entity43 said his party would stick with its policy of an annual levy – but suggested it might have to be amended following the chancellor ’s changes			0
labour opponents of its version of a mansion tax has also stepped up their campaign to persuade mr @entity7 to shift his position			1
but the shadow chancellor , in an interview with the @entity57 , insisted : ' saving the @entity20 will be at the heart of our first budget			1
i would like to see that revenue coming in in the first year of a @entity0 government , before the end of the financial year			2
we will have to see the practicalities			0
' chancellor @entity39 has called the mansion tax a levy on family homes the @entity39 denied this would amount to retrospective legislation			2
' a charge is paid in that year on the valuation on a date in that year			0
we will be clear what we are going to do in our manifesto			0
no one will have any doubt about our intentions , ' he insisted			0
' i am sure that the @entity1 will be gearing up to make sure we can deliver this			2
' the coalition has sought to undermine mr @entity7 's pledge to raise £ 2.5bn for the @entity20 through a combination of the mansion tax , a a levy on tobacco firms and reducing tax avoidance by hedge funds by announcing its own £ 3bn boost at the autumn statement			1
critics also pointed out that revenues from these measures were unlikely to start flowing in until the middle of the next @entity100			0
if unable to impose the tax that early , mr @entity7 said @entity0 would will legislate for the mansion tax to start in the following financial year , 2016 - 17 , ' as a backstop '			1
@entity0 ’s mansion tax will be about £ 3,000 a year for homes in the £ 2m to £ 3m bracket , with far higher annual charges running into tens of thousands of pounds for more expensive properties			2
to raise the £ 1.2bn a year @entity0 predicts , experts say an average charge of £ 11,000 a year will need to be levied			2
the proposal has been criticised by most of the @entity9 in the running to be the next mayor of @entity115 , given the capital will bear the brunt of the tax			0
the @entity119 have branded it a ' homes tax ' and predict it will quickly be extended to cover cheaper properties to raise the forecast revenues .			0
