by @entity0 this is the terrifying moment a huge great white shark attacked a boat carrying four men and started chewing on the outboard motor			1
the fishing vessel was travelling about two miles off the coast of @entity8 in the @entity10 state of @entity11 , when the shark started circling			0
although it launched an attack on the boat minutes later , the fishermen were not fazed , laughing as they grabbed a camera to film themselves feeding the 16 foot monster a tin of tuna , before slapping it and sending it on its way			2
the huge creature swam among dolphins while circling the boat before trying to attack its outboard motor ( pictured ) and bait box prowl : the fishing vessel was travelling about two miles off the coast of @entity8 in the @entity10 state of @entity11 , when the shark started circling fear : the fishermen originally thought the large shadow beneath the water was one of the dolphins they had spotted in the area minutes earlier			1
reality struck , however , when the great white got closer to the surface and its tell - tale fin started protruding from the water stalking : the fishermen switched off their engine after the great white attacked the boat , which appeared to calm it down			1
the shark followed the boat as it drifted along for about two hours , giving the men time to take photographs and film themselves feeding it tins of tuna not scared : although it launched an attack on the boat , the fishermen were not phased , laughing as they grabbed a camera to film themselves feeding the 16 foot monster a tin of tuna , before slapping it and sending it on its way the fishermen originally thought the large shadow beneath the water was one of the dolphins they had spotted in the area minutes earlier			1

' i saw one with a massive fin and said ' that ’s not a dolphin ' , then he came up to the back of the boat and started having a go at the transducer and bait board , ' fisherman @entity79 told @entity29 's @entity90 news channel			0
' when it first came up it was a bit daunting , it was a shark the same size as the boat and it pushed the boat around a couple of times , ' he added			0
confusion : fisherman @entity79 thought the massive great white shark may have been a dolphin at first			2
he realised he had made a mistake when the creature started attacking the outboard motor and bait board visitors : once the fishermen turned off their engines the shark calmed down and followed them as they drifted			1
the fishermen even called other boats in the area to the scene ( pictured ) so they could also enjoy the once - in - a - lifetime spectacle risk : the great white appeared so content that the men even started teasing the wild animal by putting their hands in the water , as they were confident it was n't going to attack them again the fishermen switched off their engine after the great white attacked the boat , which appeared to calm it down			1

goodbye : deciding they had had enough of its company , fisherman @entity136 eventually slapped the shark on the nose , scaring it off			0
the men estimated it to be about 16 foot long - the same length as their boat damage : although the shark was calm for much of the time it spent following the fishing boat , the consequences of its attack on the outboard motor were clear to see speaking to @entity29 's @entity90 news channel later , fisherman @entity79 ( pictured ) said : ' i saw one with a massive fin and said ' that @entity158 s not a dolphin ' , then he came up to the back of the boat and started having a go at the transducer and bait board ' perhaps unsurprisingly the shark started nudging the boat shortly after , and began trying to attack the bait box the fishermen were carrying onboard			1
