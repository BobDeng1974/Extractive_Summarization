by @entity0 a ' rock star ' economist who wrote a bestselling book about the growing wealth gap between the rich and poor appears to have got his sums wrong			1
@entity6 , 42 , included a number of errors and spreadsheets in @entity10 , which has dominated book charts around the world in recent weeks			1
the 577 - page thesis , which claims wealth inequality has been soaring since the @entity16 , uses a huge amount of statistics as evidence			2
but an investigation found there were errors in transcripts from original sources and incorrect forumulaes			2
@entity6 , 42 , is believed to have included mistakes in his book @entity10 , which claims wealth inequality is soaring			1
he says he made it clear that some of the data needed to be changed for example , his figures claim wealth became more concentrated in @entity35 during the 1980s , but his sources do not back it up			2
he is also alleged to have cherry - picked some of the information			1
when @entity41 stripped down the data , they found that there was no evidence of rising wealth inequality from 1970			0
in the book , he urges that income taxes should be increased to 80pc on earnings in excess of either £ 300,000 or £ 500,000 a year			2
there are claims the @entity53 economist ' cherry - picked ' information to include in the 577 - page thesis , which suggests the gap between rich and poor has been increasing since the @entity16 he also suggests a global wealth tax , imposed at the rate of 1 per cent a year on fortunes of £ 600,000 to £ 3 million , up to as much as 10 per cent for those earning more than a billion			1
defending the claims , professor @entity6 said he has made it clear that some of the statistics need changing and has published his work online so it can be altered in the future			1
he said : ' as i make clear in the book , in the online appendix , and in the many technical papers i have published on this topic , one needs to make a number of adjustments to the raw data sources so as to make them more homogenous over time and across countries			0
' i have tried in the context of this book to make the most justified choices and arbitrages about data sources and adjustments			0
the top line shows how much of @entity85 wealth is concentrated in the top 10 per cent of income earners and the bottom refers to the top 1 per cent			0
the yellow line represents @entity6 's estimates whereas the blue lines represent the aggregate of figures collated from a number of financial bodies			1
the discrepancy between @entity6 's sums increases after 1970 with large gaps in the data in 2010 ' i have no doubt that my historical data series can be improved and will be improved in the future			1
' ' but i would be very surprised if any of the substantive conclusion about the long run evolution of wealth distributions was much affected by these improvements			0
he also argues that the rise in top wealth shares in the @entity110 in recent decades has been even larger than what he shows in his book			0
the work has received plaudits from economists and politicians around the world			0
@entity119 told the @entity120 : ' i ’m in the early stages of the book			0
in a way , he is symptomatic of what people are actually feeling '			0
@entity127 - winner @entity126 from @entity128 said : ' it will be the most important economics book of the year			2
