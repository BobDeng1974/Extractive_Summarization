by @entity0 @entity2 flowed on the surface of @entity4 as recently as 200,000 years ago , new research suggests			1
a young crater in the red planet 's southern hemisphere contains well - preserved gullies and sediment deposits thought to have been formed by water			1
scientists studying the crater estimated it to be no more than about 200,000 years old , so the water features must have appeared since then , the scientists claim			1
the @entity4 landforms were shown to be similar to known debris flows on the @entity25 @entity24 islands in the @entity26 ( bottom right ) the crater formed long after the most recent proposed ice age on @entity4 , which ended some 400,000 years ago			1
‘ gullies are common on @entity4 but the ones which have been studied previously are older , and the sediments where they have formed are associated with the most recent ice age , ’ said lead scientist dr @entity30 , from the @entity31 in @entity32			1
‘ our study crater on @entity4 is far too young to have been influenced by the conditions that were prevalent then			2
the crater formed long after the most recent proposed ice age on @entity4 , which ended some 400,000 years ago			1
this is an artist 's impression of what a lake on @entity4 may have looked like evidence of water on @entity4 dates back to the @entity47 mission , which arrived in 1971			2
it revealed clues of water erosion in river beds and canyons as well as weather fronts and fogs			0
@entity56 orbiters that followed caused a revolution in our ideas about water on @entity4 by showing how floods broke through dams and carved deep valleys			2
@entity4 is currently in the middle of an ice age , so liquid water can not exist on its surface at the present time			1
however , the planet seems to have been warmer and wetter in the past			0
in june last year , @entity71 found @entity73 evidence that water good enough to drink once flowed on @entity4			2
in september , the first scoop of soil analysed by @entity71 revealed that fine materials on the surface of the planet contain two per cent water by weight			0
‘ this suggests that the melt water - related processes that formed these deposits have been exceptionally effective also in more recent times			2
’ the crater had features that were characteristic of debris flows on @entity89 caused by material being carried and then deposited by fast - moving water			1
the @entity4 landforms were compared with known debris flows on the @entity25 @entity24 islands in the @entity26			1
‘ our fieldwork on @entity24 confirmed our interpretation of the @entity4 deposits , ’ said dr @entity30 , whose findings appear in the scientific journal @entity98			2
‘ what surprised us was that the crater in which these debris flows have formed is so young			1
’ the study crater is located in the mid-latitudes of the @entity107 and superimposed on the ‘ rampart ejecta ’ of a nearby larger crater			0
@entity111 ejecta , which display flower - like features , are believed to be the result of a meteor impact on wet or icy ground			0
the scientists first thought the recent water flow features had come from preserved ice within the rampart ejecta			1
however , structures such as faults or fractures that could have acted as conduits for the melt water were missing			0
‘ it is more likely that the water has come from melting snow packs , when the conditions were favourable for snow formation , ’ said dr @entity30			0
‘ this is possible since the orbital axis of @entity4 was more tilted in the past than it is today			0

the young crater on @entity4 has features such as debris flows and gullies
these were compared with debris flows on the @entity25 @entity24 islands
they are thought to have been formed by liquid water after the most recent proposed ice age on @entity4 , which ended some 400,000 years ago
