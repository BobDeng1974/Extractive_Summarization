@entity1 ' £ 12million transfer to @entity2 suggests all is not lost when it comes to the production line of young @entity6 talent			1
the 19 - year - old is already being tipped for a full call - up when international football resumes later this summer			2
@entity12 ' former @entity11 team - mate @entity10 won his first @entity14 caps towards the end of last season and a £ 30m move to @entity18 duly followed			1
big things to come : @entity43 keeper @entity42 has experience beyond his years perhaps his residence in the lower leagues is the reason for that , but this agile yet imposing goalkeeper – he 's 6ft 4in – is set for bigger things and has more senior experience than any young @entity6 stopper of his age			1
right back : @entity1 ( @entity2 ) his £ 12million move to @entity2 this week has already triggered talk of him maturing into a future @entity14 captain , especially with @entity62 keen to convert him into a centre back			1
top young gun : @entity12 is hugely regarded by @entity62 and could be a future @entity14 captain still only 19 and with just 23 first - team appearances for @entity11 , the @entity26 are nonetheless convinced he is a star of the future and their judgement on former @entity11 graduates @entity72 and @entity73 has proved sound in the past			1
@entity76 aims to emulate @entity78 stars centre back : @entity79 ( @entity80 ) the 20 - year - old has shot to prominence this summer - £ 5m bids from @entity39 clubs have a tendency to generate such fuss – but it is not without good reason			1
without weakness : for a 20 - year - old , @entity80 's @entity79 has a remarkably well - rounded game @entity79 is a class act ; watch him play and you can not identify a weakness			1
forest are determined to keep him at the @entity95 and that could well prove the best setting for his development under former @entity14 under 21 boss @entity99			0
centre back : @entity100 ( @entity101 ) when a player makes their senior debut at 15 years old then he must have a bit about him			2
classy and versatile : defender - midfielder @entity100 made his senior debut at just 15 years old and in the case of @entity110 – a classy defender - cum - midfielder in the mould of @entity113 – that is certainly true			0
@entity39 clubs – @entity116 chief among them – are circling and a £ 4million price tag has been slapped on the 18 - year - old			0
left back : @entity120 ( @entity11 ) it 's perhaps folly to assume that @entity120 will follow in the stud marks on @entity123 and @entity10 , but @entity11 's production line is showing no signs of winding up just yet			2
and , in the form of 18 - year - old left - back @entity120 , they have another talented teen ready to grace the senior stage this season			2
the new saint : @entity120 is another huge talent off the @entity134 production line centre midfield : @entity19 ( @entity136 ) @entity136 's young player of the year was prolific from midfield last season , scoring 17 times for the @entity140			1
@entity141 says he will take the blame should @entity19 not go on to earn full international honours , and that suggests elevation to the first - team could well be on the agenda			0
the @entity14 under 19 schemer is a deadball specialist and is comfortable on either foot			0
blue streak : @entity19 ( right ) was @entity136 's young player of the year with 17 goals for the @entity140 21s centre midfield : @entity154 ( @entity155 ) having only turned 19 in april , @entity154 's experience for a player of such tender years is remarkable and he is now just 11 outings shy of his 100th at club level			1
he has seemingly decided the best place to add to that experience is at @entity155 , as he signed a new four - year deal this summer			2
he can pass , dribble , score , create and gets about the park ; he may be in the championship this season but the @entity39 surely awaits			0
hard to keep : will @entity154 signed a four - year deal with @entity155 but a @entity39 move is likely right wing : @entity171 ( @entity172 ) @entity172 's relegation could well prove a blessing for the diminutive forward who , at 5ft 5in and with a liking for a mesmerising dribble , has been likened to @entity178			1
he scored twice during @entity182 ' @entity181 success this summer and has seven from 14 international appearances			0
@entity172 boss @entity184 has described the 17 - year - old as ' an extraordinary talent ' and the club are said to have put a £ 15m price tag on his head to ward off interest from @entity18 among others			2
@entity172 's @entity178 : @entity171 has been likened to the @entity193 master for his mesmerising dribbling left wing : @entity196 ( @entity197 ) the secret was out when the explosive winger debuted for @entity200 at 15 and @entity197 made certain they were the club to secure the teen talent			1
he has progressed to the fringe of the senior side at @entity204 and assisted in both goals during their 2 - 1 win at @entity207 earlier this month			0
obvious comparison with @entity209 has been drawn , but you would n't bet against the 18 - year - old enjoying a breakthrough campaign in much the same fashion as his team - mate did last time around			2
@entity197 lad : @entity196 impressed for @entity200 at just 15 and the @entity216 made sure they snapped him up striker : @entity20 ( @entity18 ) ' @entity20 scores goals , ' his former schoolteacher told @entity33 last year			1
the 18 - year - old duly debuted for @entity18 against @entity221 and bagged a brace in a 3 - 1 win			0
then caretaker boss @entity224 had charted his progress through the academy and wasted no time in handing him a senior start			0
he may have to be a little more patient under @entity228 , but goals are his game and , to that end , age is an irrelevance			0
boy wonder : @entity20 scored a double on his @entity18 debut last season striker : @entity239 ( @entity240 ) devastatingly quick , the @entity242 frontman was part of the @entity14 under 17 squad which triumphed at the @entity245 in @entity246 this summer			1
@entity247 has already given him a taste of senior action and the @entity240 like what they see , quickly conducting a terrace chant for one of their own			0
more first - team exposure beckons and , with @entity18 short on out - and - out attacking options , a couple of early - season strikes could well see him win an extended stay in the side			0
@entity240 flyer : @entity239 is a speedster the @entity240 have taken an immediate liking to			0

@entity12 signed for @entity2 in a £ 12million deal from @entity11
the @entity26 ' new arrival is tipped to make his international debut this year
@entity33 's @entity271 young guns includes @entity12 at right back
his former club - mate @entity120 would be on the left with @entity80 's @entity79 and @entity101 ' @entity100 as the centre backs
@entity136 's @entity19 and @entity155 's @entity154 are the central midfielders with @entity197 's @entity196 and @entity172 's @entity171 on the wings
@entity43 keeper @entity42 is the oldest of the line - up at 21
@entity20 ( @entity18 ) and @entity239 ( @entity240 ) are up front
