by @entity1 reporter published : 04:57 est , 9 november 2013 updated : 05:01 est , 9 november 2013 housebuilders will no longer be allowed to delay big developments after the government introduced stricter rules to prevent so - called ' land banking '			1
planning minister @entity7 has scrapped a 2008 measure - introduced in the midst of the financial crisis - which allowed three - year permissions to be easily extended			1
some developers exploit the loophole and hoard plots for years as they wait for house prices to rise before starting to build homes			1
getting tough : planning minister @entity7 has scrapped a loophole which allows developers to extend planning permission			1
the announcement comes weeks after @entity21 leader @entity20 , right , threatened to seize land from firms who do n't build on time mr @entity7 said : ' this measure to extend planning permission was always intended to be temporary and , while it made sense in the aftermath of @entity21 's financial crash when there was no money to build , as the economy improves the focus must be on accelerating the number of homes being built to meet demand , ' he said			1
' this ending of the measure will increase the incentive for developers to start on site before permission expires			0
we are also now seeking to tackle the inappropriate use of planning conditions and speed up the process of gaining non-planning consents			0
' the policy change comes in the wake of @entity21 leader @entity20 's announcement in septemer that the party would seize developers ' land if the failed to build			1
he accuses developers of ' sitting on ' lucrative land , pointing to research which found there were 400,000 homes that have not been built despite councils giving planning permission			2
mr @entity7 said those policies amounted to ' heavy handed ... taxes and land grabs ' which would slow the process and result in fewer homes being built			2
' if developers fear new development taxes or state confiscation of land , they will be less willing to undertake complex land assembly projects ; they will let their existing planning permissions lapse ; or they will simply be more cautious in applying for planning permission in the first place , ' he said			2
@entity77 , located in one of the @entity80 's most exclusive districts , was sold to @entity82 property company @entity81 by the @entity83 for a record £ 959m in 2007 - but work on the £ 3bn development has still not started , leading it to be dubbed ' @entity87 's most valuable wasteland '			1
the £ 3bn project first hit the buffers in 2009 when the firm , which bought the exclusive plot at the top of the housing bubble , withdrew its original plan for 552 flats after prince @entity96 criticised it in a letter to the @entity99 president			2
amid rising costs and delays , another application was then submitted in 2011 for 600 units but , despite outline planning permission being granted , nothing was done			0
@entity77 in @entity80 has been dubbed @entity87 's most valuable wasteland after being sold for £ 959m it was stalled further earlier this year when @entity81 put the entire project ' under review ' , before being ordered by @entity109 to ' start or sell ' the 13 - acre site			1
and the message appears to be getting through after the firm recently announced demolition work on all the site 's remaining empty buildings is due to start this month , with the latest plans encompassing 448 flats , including 123 affordable			0
a spokesman said : ' contrary to recent press reports , we are fully committed to the @entity77 development , are are currently negotiating rights to light with its neighbours			0
' @entity81 ’s other @entity80 projects include the purchase of the @entity129 @entity128 site in @entity130 , the development of the @entity133 building in @entity134 and the joint venture with @entity136 for the @entity137 ’ @entity138 in the olympic park			0
mr @entity7 dismissed the 400,000 figure as a ' canard ' deployed by local authority chiefs , insisting the latest data showed that of 257,200 unstarted private projects , 184,600 were ' progressing towards a start ' , 13,500 were ' being sold or information was not available ' and only 59,100 were ' on hold or shelved '			0
@entity148 , director general of the @entity149 , questioned the effect of ending the rollover measure - which would require fresh applications should a permission lapse			0
' obtaining permission , particularly for large projects , is a very expensive and time - consuming process , ' he told the @entity157			0
' if builders do not have certainty that they will be able to use the land when they are ready to do so , it seems likely that it will deter some from applying in the first place			0
' @entity165 planning minister @entity164 said : ' with even the government 's own statistics showing that there are hundreds of thousands of units with permission but not being built , they should support @entity21 's comprehensive measures to stop land banking of sites where the local community has given permission for homes to be built but developers are not building them			1

' land - banking ' *culture* to be scrapped to encourage house - building
firms have been exploiting loophole in order to wait for house price rises
