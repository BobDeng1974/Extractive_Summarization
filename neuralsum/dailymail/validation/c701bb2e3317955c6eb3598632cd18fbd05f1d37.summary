@entity1 scientists have made a major breakthrough in treating @entity3 's with a new drug - free method that can restore memory loss			1
researchers at the @entity8 's @entity7 hope to be able to trial their new ' cheap and mobile ' ultrasound device within two years on humans			1
the treatment attacks the neurotoxic amyloid plaques that cause memory loss and cognitive failure with ultrasound waves			1
research director professor @entity19 hopes the new method will revolutionise @entity3 's treatment by restoring memory for sufferers			2

' we 're extremely excited by this innovation of treating @entity3 's without using drug therapeutics , ' professor @entity19 said , according to the @entity1			0
' the word ' breakthrough ' is often misused , but in this case i think this really does fundamentally change our understanding of how to treat this disease , and i foresee a great future for this approach			0
' the mobile device could be used by patients in their own homes several times a year , eliminating the need for expensive drug treatment that costs up to $ 250,000 , prof @entity19 said			1
' with an ageing population placing an increasing burden on the health system , an important factor is cost , and other potential drug treatments using antibodies will be expensive , ' he said			0

' in contrast , this method uses relatively inexpensive ultrasound and microbubble technology which is non-invasive and appears highly effective			0
' almost two thirds of all dementia patients in @entity1 suffer from @entity3 's , which accounts for almost 250,000 people			0
the total number of dementia cases in @entity1 is expected to rise to 900,000 by 2050			0
findings of the research , ' scanning ultrasound efficiently removes amyloid - β and restores memory in an @entity3 's model ' , are published in the journal .			2

@entity8 scientists have made the *medical* breakthrough
' cheap ' and ' mobile ' ultrasound device that can be used for treatment
drug - free treatment breaks down the plaques that cause memory loss
will be particularly *helpful* to suffers in the early stages of the illness
*tested* on mice who were *put* through mazes and had to remember *objects*
