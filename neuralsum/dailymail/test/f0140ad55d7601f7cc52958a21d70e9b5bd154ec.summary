freckly - faced carrot tops once mocked for their distinctive hair are flourishing into flame - haired sex symbols as the redhead takes the celebrity world by storm			1
from @entity8 starlets and musical sex symbols to a certain member of the royal family , according to copper - locked actor @entity12 , his hair colour is having a moment on screens both big and small			1
whether their rouge colouring is au naturel or straight out of a packet , we 're loving the fiery - haired stars flying the flag for gingers everywhere			1
' this might be a unique moment in recent history : redheads everywhere are doing well - @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 , me , @entity39			1
' in truth , many of us have nurtured secret crushes on those with bold barnets for years , with prince @entity35 transforming from a cute ginger kid into a bone - fide hot - haired hunk before the nation 's eyes			1
then there 's our admiration for the eternal glamour of @entity37 , who has been lighting up our screens with her lioness 's mane since the 1990s			0
the 54 - year - old has embraced her natural colour and hopes to help young reds to do the same			2
she even penned a bestselling children 's book @entity61 , about a young redhead girl finding confidence in a world full of blondes and brunettes			0
prince @entity35 transformed from a cute ginger kid into a bona fide hot - haired hunk before the nation 's eyes @entity37 has embraced her natural colour and hopes to help young reds to do the same for others , the love of red locks stormed its way into their hearts and hair salons thanks to the fiery females in @entity79			1
@entity82 and @entity83 rock luminous - looking locks with porcelain skin , while auburn - haired @entity87 - aka @entity86 woman - seduces would - be kings , turning them into putty in her hands			1
@entity92 , who plays @entity82 , is in fact a natural blonde , which is what makes her red such a vibrant shade of copper			2
@entity92 has said her dyed locks are what get her recognised , and so when she 's not filming for @entity79 , she goes back to her natural colour			1
perhaps the first moment you felt a weakness for a man with a mop of auburn curls was when @entity107 let out that adorable squeak during his @entity110 performance			0
in truth , he 's only borderline ginger , with his red hue and freckles hibernating in winter			2
not that @entity107 would know - he 's colour blind , so ca n't distinguish between red and green			1
@entity107 is actually colour blind , so is unable to see how gorgeous his red locks are of course we ca n't talk about sexy gingers without mentioning man of the musical moment , @entity36			2
his tattoos may look as if they 've been drawn in @entity123 , but his carroty mop top and ginger stubble do nothing to quash our daydreams of being the woman in his ' @entity131 ' music video			0
or , even better , the woman the song is about			0
and this singer / songwriter has revealed he does n't plan on changing his look anytime soon			0
although the reasoning behind this is more to do with his need to cover his ' non-existent ' eyebrows			0
' they have no definition so i just end up looking like a big white blob , ' he joked to @entity143			0
@entity36 uses his red mop to cover up his ' non-existent ' eyebrows			2
' they have no definition so i just end up looking like a big white blob , ' he joked arguably , though , when it comes to rocking the red , the @entity148 have it , as proved by the oh - so - cute @entity152			1
inheriting his vibrant hair colour from his actor father @entity155 star @entity155 , @entity153 has exchanged his dad 's brutish bushy ginger beard for a tousled mop of strawberry - blond locks			1
he played the leading man opposite @entity161 in @entity162 , and while he might not be @entity163 ( who is ? ) , he captured our ginger - loving hearts			2
@entity152 captured our ginger - loving hearts in @entity162 , opposite @entity161 @entity167 has recently changed her crimson colour as she says goodbye to her @entity169 character back to the ladies , ever since @entity167 strutted onto our screens in @entity169 we 've had a serious case of the green - eyed monster over her hourglass curves and sophisticated strawberry waves			1
( it 's lucky , then , that green eyes suit red hair perfectly			1
) but , as she bid farewell to @entity169 , her @entity169 character , she also bid goodbye to her ruby - red locks , trading them for a golden blonde			1
she 's said that it was to represent her fresh start , but we suspect it may also have something to do with her being the face of @entity189 hair dye ... flame - haired actress @entity190 is another red dipping her toe into blonde waters , as she will transform her red hair to play perhaps the most iconic blonde of all time , 1950s bombshell , @entity197			1
she 'll also be following in the footsteps of @entity199 , who temporarily swapped her amber aura for a platinum ' do to play painter @entity202 in @entity203			0
another actress who reached for the dye for a role is @entity207 , who went blonde for her role as @entity210 in the @entity212 movies			0
she actually claims to be a natural blonde , but we refuse to believe her as she was clearly born to be red			0
@entity190 will transform her hair to play perhaps the most iconic blonde of all time , @entity197 @entity207 claims to be a natural blonde , but we refuse to believe her as she was clearly born to be red @entity219 bucked the blonde beach waves trend from her home country of @entity222 , swapping them for loose auburn curls			1
the actress , who is married to @entity226 ( aka , @entity227 ) , has said that she likes the fact her hair makes her look different to most , but admitted she got more attention when she lightened her locks for her role as @entity232 in 2002 's @entity233			0
back in 2002 , @entity234 made it cool to be crimson when she was selected to be a member of @entity238 , a girl band created on @entity239 : the @entity240			0
@entity222 @entity219 swapped the blonde beach waves trend from her home country for loose auburn curls @entity242 may have hogged the spotlight , but we 've always admired @entity234 's doll - with - an - attitude look ; her pale skin setting off her vibrant hair perfectly			2
keeping on the doll theme , @entity39 reminds us of a red - headed rag doll we had as a child - in a good way , of course			2
her pale cheeks and big blue eyes offset the model 's red mane perfectly , making her stand out in a world of blondes and brunettes			0
indeed , this glamorous lot go to show gingers should be proud of their out - of - the - ordinary locks			0
suddenly our shade seems rather dull ... excuse us , we 're off to call our hairdressers .			0
