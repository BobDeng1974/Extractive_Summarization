by @entity0 if you thought @entity2 was the best place in the solar system to find signs of life , you might need to think again			1
the largest moon in our solar system , a companion to @entity11 named @entity12 , might have ice and oceans stacked up in several layers like a club sandwich			1
and the @entity18 - funded research suggests that this may have once been a suitable environment for primitive life			1
scroll down for animation @entity23 and his team showed that ice and water under the surface has different densities			2
at the top is the lightest ' @entity30 ' that is similar to ice cubes in your drink , ranging to the heaviest and densest ' @entity35 ' that would sink to the bottom of the sea previously , the moon was thought to harbour a thick ocean sandwiched between just two layers of ice , one on top and one on bottom , but now it seems it has multiple layers			1
the study , led by @entity23 of @entity18 's @entity49 in @entity50 , @entity51 , provides new theoretical evidence for the team 's ‘ club sandwich ’ model , first proposed last year			1
the @entity18 - funded research modelling the moon 's makeup supports idea that primitive life might have possibly arisen on the icy moon			1
scientists say that places where water and rock interact are important for the development of life for example , it 's possible life began on @entity70 in bubbling vents on our sea floor			2
prior to the new study , @entity12 's rocky sea bottom was thought to be coated with ice , not liquid - a problem for the emergence of life			1
the ' club sandwich ' findings suggest otherwise : the first layer on top of the rocky core might be salty water			2
' this is good news for @entity12 , ' said @entity23			2
' its ocean is huge , with enormous pressures , so it was thought that dense ice had to form at the bottom of the ocean			1
' when we added salts to our models , we came up with liquids dense enough to sink to the sea floor			0
' @entity12 is one of @entity11 's four largest satellites known as the @entity100 moons			1
from left to right in this artist 's mosaic they are @entity104 , @entity105 , @entity12 and @entity106			2
they are pictured above the @entity108 , a storm on @entity11 that has been raging for over 400 years @entity18 scientists first suspected an ocean in @entity12 in the 1970s , based on models of the large moon , which is bigger than @entity114			1
in the 1990s , @entity18 's @entity116 mission flew by @entity12 , confirming the moon 's ocean , and showing it extends to depths of hundreds of miles			1
the spacecraft also found evidence for salty seas , likely containing the salt magnesium sulfate			0
previous models of @entity12 's oceans assumed that salt did n't change the properties of liquid very much with pressure			1
@entity12 is one of five moons in our solar system thought to support vast oceans beneath icy crusts			1
the other moons are @entity11 's @entity105 and @entity106 and @entity139 's @entity138 and @entity140			0
the @entity141 ( @entity141 ) is developing a space mission , called @entity143 ( juice ) , pictured above , to visit @entity105 , @entity106 and @entity12 in the 2030s			0
@entity18 and @entity49 are contributing to three instruments on the mission , which is scheduled to launch in 2022			0
the lightest ice is on top , and the saltiest liquid is heavy enough to sink to the bottom			2
what 's more , the results demonstrate a possible bizarre phenomenon that causes the oceans to ' snow upwards			2
' as the oceans churn and cold plumes snake around , ice in the uppermost ocean layer , called ' @entity159 , ' could form in the seawater			2
when ice forms , salts precipitate out			0
the heavier salts would fall downwards , and the lighter ice , or ' snow , ' would float upwards			0
this ' snow ' melts again before reaching the top of the ocean , possibly leaving slush in the middle of the moon sandwich			0
@entity174 and @entity23 are both members of the @entity177 team at @entity49 , part of the multi-institutional @entity179 based at the @entity180 in @entity181 , @entity51			0
the results can be applied to exoplanets too , planets that circle stars beyond our sun. some super-earths , rocky planets more massive than @entity70 , have been proposed as ' water worlds ' covered in oceans			0
@entity23 and his team think laboratory experiments and more detailed modeling of exotic oceans might help find answers as to whether they could have life			0
@entity11 's @entity12 , artist 's illustration of the interior pictured , is the largest moon in the solar system			1
although it was previously thought to have an underground ocean , new research from @entity18 suggests it may actually have layers of ice of different density surrounding its subsurface seas that may have hosted life it may seem strange that salt can make the ocean denser , but you can see for yourself how this works by adding plain old table salt to a glass of water			1
rather than increasing in volume , the liquid shrinks and becomes denser			0
this is because the salt ions attract water molecules			0
the models get more complicated when the different forms of ice are taken into account			0
the ice that floats in your drinks is called ' @entity30 ' it 's the least dense form of ice and lighter than water			0
but at high pressures , like those in crushingly deep oceans like @entity12 's , the ice crystal structures become more compact			1
' it 's like finding a better arrangement of shoes in your luggage - the ice molecules become packed together more tightly , ' said @entity23			0
the ice can become so dense that it is heavier than water and falls to the bottom of the sea			0
the densest and heaviest ice thought to persist in @entity12 is called ' @entity35			1
' by modeling these processes using computers , the team came up with an ocean sandwiched between up to three ice layers , in addition to the rocky seafloor .			0

@entity18 researchers have discovered that @entity12 's subsurface is layered
they say that it has different densities of ice surrounding a vast ocean
at the top is ice similar to that in your drink , while densest is at bottom
this could have created a bizarre *scenario* where it ' snowed upwards '
the research also suggests this watery layer was ideal for primitive life
and it could help us discover *habitable* planets outside the solar system
