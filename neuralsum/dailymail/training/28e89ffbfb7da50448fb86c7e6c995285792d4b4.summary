@entity0 has been forced to shrug off an attack by a @entity3 newspaper that described the @entity4 as ‘ just an old @entity6 country ’ only fit for tourists and students			1
the prime minister said he would concentrate on the ‘ facts and figures ’ showing rapidly increasing @entity3 investment in @entity4 , rather than the excoriating article in the @entity15 - based @entity14			1

‘ moreover , @entity4 is no longer any kind of “ big country ” , but merely a country of old @entity6 suitable for tourism and overseas study , with a few decent football teams			0
’ its sneering conclusion said : ‘ we wish prime minister @entity0 and his delegation a pleasant visit to @entity3			1
’ the newspaper appeared to backtrack later , apparently on the orders of the @entity3 government , with a softer piece about the prime minister			1
it said : ‘ @entity3 and the @entity4 hold divergent views in terms of human rights , democracy and freedom because of different development phases , political systems and ideologies			2
but this should neither dominate bilateral ties nor overshadow the momentum for cooperation			0
