by @entity1 reporter published : 10:27 est , 7 september 2012 updated : 11:29 est , 7 september 2012 a pensioner has spent more than a decade painstakingly copying out every single word of the bible - in a 1,500 - page labour of love			1
religious @entity7 , 78 , came up with the idea of copying the religious text after mobility problems left him housebound back in 2001			1
the amateur artist then wrote out the whole of the religious text on @entity16 paper - using hundreds of parker pens and sketching out more than 5,000 colourful illustrations			1
mr @entity7 , who now wants to sell his unique book for charity , got a letter from the pope and the archbishop of @entity24 , after finishing his work - believed to be a world first			1
dedicated : @entity7 shows off part of his hand written and illustrated bibles			1
the folders behind him all contain different parts of the religious book the @entity33 , who moved to @entity35 in 1961 , said : ' i have dedicated my whole life to this for years and have done it every single day i could			1
' i know it is perhaps considered old - fashioned but i am a @entity40 and this was something i wanted to do			2
' it is unique - people have told me that they have not seen anything like it before			0
' mr @entity7 , from @entity46 , @entity47 , first thought of the idea after struggling to get out the house after giving up work in a book shop			1
the grandfather - of - three bought an @entity54 copy of the @entity55 and a @entity57 book of the new testament and began writing it out on @entity60 using a parker pen			2
keen artist mr @entity7 also began creating illustrations for the text using water colours , crayons and collages			1
he would then cut them out and stick them into his bible			2
this colourful illustration of @entity71 and one of his followers is one of more than 5,000 that mr @entity7 has done while recreating the @entity75 unique : this page of the bible has a number of illustrations accompanying the words			1
the book is set to be published once copyright issues have been sorted out mr @entity7 said : ' i would start every morning , do 8am until 10 or 11am , again in the afternoon and then for a long time in the evening			1
' i started on @entity85 and just kept going			0
i put four to five illustrations on each page of text then a larger drawing every five pages or so			2
proud : mr @entity7 shows off his work , which he has dedicated himself to for the last ten years ' i put quite a lot of energy into it			1
' the influences from @entity7 ’s drawings range from @entity97 to @entity98 , from @entity99 to @entity100 - with a little bit of each hidden in his pictures			2
one larger image has a line from @entity105 alongside a picture of holocaust victim @entity107			0
another is inspired by @entity109			0
mr @entity7 has now finished his masterpiece and even won praise from the @entity112 after his son sent details of the work to @entity116			2
his children , @entity117 , 38 , and @entity118 , 36 , now plan to publish the book both in print form , on the @entity122 and as an @entity123			1
he is just waiting on the final copyright permission to come through after using text from an @entity54 - based translation			0
mr @entity7 said : ' i wo n’t make a penny from it			2
i want the proceeds to be divided up between charities , including @entity132			0
' my son sent it to @entity116 and i got a letter back thanking me for taking the time to do it			0
i also got a letter from and @entity138 and the @entity75 makers			0
' they said they had never seen anything like it			0
' i did n’t realise the @entity75 was subject to copyright but we are expecting the permission to come through soon so it could be printed later this year			0
' i will keep painting			0
i do pictures for friends and love painting my family			0
i ca n’t go out any more because of my health , but i still have my painting and i am thankful for that			0
