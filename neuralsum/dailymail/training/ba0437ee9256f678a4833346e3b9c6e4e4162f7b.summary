it 's the dilemma that haunts every @entity2 homeowner : how safe are my children from a zombie apocalypse ? a @entity7 merchant has finally answered public concerns by making a undead - proof shed - which will set you back a mere £ 69,995 , plus £ 20,780 for installation , @entity12 , riot gear and solar panels			1
the so - called @entity15 also has an escape hatch , an interior garden , weapons storage and a 360 - degree vantage point , all with a ten - year anti-zombie guarantee			1
a flamethrower or water cannon , however , will cost you extra			1
one , @entity52 , called it the ' @entity53 ' adding : ' in my time i ’ve had little respect as an electronics shop employee , with no real direction in life			1
but when i bought this zombie proof log cabin i became the envy of all my neighbours ! ' it ’s big enough for me as well as my girlfriend and rather vulgar unemployed best friend ( who could quite easily be mistaken for a zombie ! )			1
with this , any potential zombie apocalypse which could overwhelm the town , i 'll have a nice cup of tea and wait for it all to blow over			2
' not everyone was happy , however			2
a disgruntled @entity73 the @entity74 wrote : ' i officially hate this zombie proof log cabin ! ! ' having roamed our way through the land mines , in just about one piece , a cluster of us avoided the flamethrowers and made it to the walls			2
no matter what we tried ( eating through the walls , climbing to the roof etc ) we just could n't break in			2
' unfortunately , as time wore on it became obvious this was a lost cause and some 28 days later we gave up			1
' protection : the expansive shed includes a place to store shotguns and bombs , beside a set of instructions on how to kill the undead ominous : all the photos in this article are artists ' impressions since , sadly , no one has yet bought one of the sheds for genuine use the bizarre idea was dreamed up by @entity7 firm @entity108 , and although there have n't yet been any sales , there have been some allegedly serious enquiries from across the @entity113			1
managing director @entity114 , 29 , told @entity115 : ' we 've had a few people from @entity118 interested who are taking it a bit literally			0
they 're thinking about having it on their ranch			0
' he added : ' obviously it 's a bit of a joke but the cabin is buildable			0
so if we get someone who 's genuinely interested and has the money we would keep to our word and go and build it for them			0
' the idea for the cabin came after a conversation in the office about what would happen in a zombie apocalypse			0
marketing director @entity139 said : ' the conversation went from there and one of the team jokingly suggested that we would all be ok because we could just build ourselves a special log cabin and all hide in there			0
from there the idea was born and we thought " well , why not "			0
' there is one hitch , however : planning permission			0
mr @entity114 conceded : ' we 'd have to say what we tell all our customers - check with your local authority because they all have different rules , even when it comes to preventing a deadly swarm of the undead '			1
diagram : the company has even produced 3d blueprints for the cabin 's design , which could be a dangerous help to brainier zombies managing director @entity114 , 29 , said : ' we 've had a few people from @entity118 interested who are taking it a bit literally '			0
