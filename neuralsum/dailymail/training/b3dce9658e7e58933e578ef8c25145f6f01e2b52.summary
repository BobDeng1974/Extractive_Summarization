by @entity0 published : 03:26 est , 10 october 2012 updated : 03:26 est , 10 october 2012 they look suspiciously fresh ; but in fact these lumps of dung are around 100,000 years old			2
they came from a giant ground sloth ( @entity6 ) , an ancient relative of modern tree sloths , armadillos and anteaters			1
the grizzly bear - sized animals used foot - long claws to grasp tree limbs and scrape off bark for meals - as scientists know from studying their fossilised dung , or ' coprolites '			2
fresh enough : these lumps of giant ground sloth dung are around 100,000 years old and reveal that the animals ate tree bark the @entity24 is the geological epoch which lasted from about 2.58million to 11,700 years ago , spanning the last ice age			1
the modern continents were essentially at their present positions during the @entity24 , the plates upon which they sit probably having moved no more than 100 km relative to each other since the beginning of the period			1
the climate of the era was marked by repeated glacial cycles where glaciers pushed to the 40th parallel in some places			2
it is estimated that , at maximum glacial extent , 30 per cent of the @entity42 's surface was covered by ice			0
during this period marine and continental faunas were essentially modern although many animals , specifically , mammals were much larger than their modern relatives			0
a major extinction event of large mammals ( megafauna ) , which included mammoths , mastodons , saber - toothed cats ( like the one pictured above right ) , glyptodons , ground sloths , @entity59 elk , cave bears , and short - faced bears , began late in the @entity24 and @entity62 also became extinct during this period			1
during the @entity24 ( 2.58million years ago â€“ 12,000 years ago ) giant ground sloths lived over much of @entity65			1
they stood 20ft ( 7m ) tall on their hind legs to get food from trees , but were otherwise rather slow - moving quadrupeds			0
conditions are sometimes so dry their dung can be preserved for thousands of years with little deterioration or change			0
these specimens where collected in april 1941 by @entity78 curator @entity77 at @entity79 in the @entity80			0
scientists have estimated them at around 100,000 years old			0
@entity84 evidence of giant ground sloths was first uncovered in 1840 by @entity86 , but complete skeletons are rare			1
@entity88 - sized : this computer generated image made for a @entity92 documentary shows how the 20ft tall animals would have stood on their hind legs to feed on tree bark			0

during the @entity24 giant ground sloths lived across @entity65
