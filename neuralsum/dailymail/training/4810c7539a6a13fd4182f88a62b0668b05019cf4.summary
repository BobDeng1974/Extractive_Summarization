by @entity0 the appalling diets of the nation ’s teenagers have been exposed by a report which shows that many are already putting themselves at risk of diabetes , obesity and heart disease			2
and last night health experts warned that fruit juice – seen by many as a healthy option – should be drunk no more than once a day because of its high sugar content			1
girls and boys aged 11 to 19 typically eat 42 per cent too much sugar and 14 per cent too much saturated fat			1
health experts have warned people to stick to one glass of fruit juice a day due to its high sugar content health experts have warned that young people aged 11 to 19 are consuming , on average , 47 per cent too much sugar , with the main sources being fruit juice , soft drinks , cereal bars , biscuits and cakes only 10 per cent of teenage boys and 7 per cent of teenage girls manage to get their five portions of fruit and veg a day			1
adults do not fare a great deal better			2
only a third get their five - a - day and the diet of the average adult exceeds recommended sugar limits by 10 per cent			1
the report , the government ’s @entity41 and @entity43 , also shows that children aged ten and under typically exceed the recommended daily limit of sugar by 34 per cent			1
their main sources of sugar are fruit juice , soft drinks , cereal bars , biscuits and cakes			1
it reveals that adults are eating half the recommended weekly amount of oily fish – which protects against heart disease , cancer and dementia – while teenagers and children only manage a fifth of this amount			1
the survey , which involved 4,000 adults and children between 2008 and 2012 , says 48 per cent of men and women have above - normal levels of cholesterol , putting them at higher risk of heart disease and strokes			1
@entity73 , chief executive of the @entity74 , said : ‘ this study paints a clear picture that too many people , especially children , are not eating healthily enough			0
‘ this puts them at greater risk of coronary heart disease , type 2 diabetes and obesity now or in the future			0
there is no magic bullet to solve this problem			0
parents , schools , restaurants , retailers and the food industry all have a role to play			0
‘ but the government can fire the first shot by implementing a 9pm watershed ban on junk food marketing to stop children being bombarded with advertising about products high in fats , salts and sugars			2
we also need stringent regulation to protect children from online marketing tactics			0
’ only a third of adults get their recommended five - a - day , and are still eating too much fat , with 48 per cent having higher - than - average cholesterol , putting them at risk of heart attacks and strokes experts have also warned that government @entity115 adverts which promote healthy eating are not working , as people who already eat healthily are the only ones who pay attention there is also concern that policies such as the @entity125 ’s @entity115 programme are having little effect because only healthy adults and children pay any attention			1
the initiative , which has cost taxpayers £ 65million since its launch in january 2009 , consists of television adverts , a website , a helpline and locally - run sports clubs all aimed at curbing the obesity epidemic			0
the scheme also produces posters for schools , community clubs , gp surgeries and hospitals urging the public to eat their five - a-day , take regular exercise and cut portion sizes			0
dr @entity148 , of the @entity149 , said : ‘ in spite of a raft of measures designed to encourage us to eat a healthier diet we are , as a nation , failing miserably			0
‘ if we really care about the health of our children we need to take far more decisive action			0
‘ we need to regulate the food industry to make healthy choices easier , more attractive and cheaper			0
’ dr @entity162 , the chief nutritionist at @entity163 , the government agency that released the report , said fruit juice was a good option as one of the recommended five fruit portions a day			1
but she warned : ‘ it should only be drunk once a day and with a meal because it can be high in sugar			2
’ in march , dame @entity173 , the chief medical officer , said the government may have to introduce a sugar tax to help make the nation ’s diet more healthy			2
later that month the @entity178 urged the public to cut their sugar intake by half to six teaspoons a day			2
yesterday @entity183 mp @entity182 called for food labels to include the numbers of teaspoons of sugar in all products .			0
