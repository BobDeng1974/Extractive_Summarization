by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity2 demonstrated his well - being for next week 's first test as @entity4 recovered well from early losses on day two of their final warm - up match against @entity7			1
two wickets in five balls for @entity10 and first - team debutant @entity12 left @entity4 18 for two , in reply to 326 for five declared at the @entity14			0
but a characteristically unhurried @entity2 ( 81 ) gradually took control in stands of 63 with @entity17 and then 119 with @entity18 in a teatime 217 for five			1
nice knock ! @entity2 scored 81 to save @entity4 from a batting embarrassment against @entity7 unflustered : @entity2 was in characteristically unhurried style as the tourists warm - up for the @entity26 series the tourists appeared to show their hand for the five - @entity30 series against @entity26 , with no place for @entity32 in the top six			1
@entity10 was significantly the most experienced of the home seam attack on the middle day here , and he was the first wicket - taker too - trapping @entity37 ( six ) lbw on the back foot			0
@entity10 's new - ball partner @entity12 made an impressive start and was rewarded in a spell of 8 - 4 - 6 - 1 with the wicket of @entity4 's other opener @entity44 - who pushed forward and edged behind to also exit for six			0
it took @entity17 10 balls to get off the mark , with a single to cover off @entity12			0
@entity4 's poster boy had a moment of concern on 18 when - in the first over from @entity53 , teenage son of former @entity26 bowler @entity54 - he edged low but marginally short of @entity55 at slip			1
there were no further concerns as @entity4 's third - wicket pair closed out the session , but @entity17 did not last long in the afternoon			1
helping hand : @entity18 engineered a century partnership with the man of the day at the @entity14 twenty - year - old @entity12 , back for more , struck again and bagged a highly - prized scalp too as @entity17 ( 36 ) tried to leave a tight line but instead chopped the ball down on to off - stump			2
@entity18 surprisingly promoted himself to number five , to good effect , as his unorthodox attack proved an ideal complement to @entity2			2
the @entity4 number three 's tried - and - trusted method is to take few risks and wait for bowlers to @entity75 duly did so as , having bowled 11 overs for eight runs , he conceded three off - side fours in his 12th to @entity2 - who brought up his 98 - ball half - century soon afterwards			2
@entity18 ( 46 ) took one liberty too many with @entity80 , who deceived the @entity4 captain in the flight to bowl him leg - stump on the charge			0
@entity2 then promptly retired himself out , for the second match in succession after doing so for 57 at @entity89 - leaving @entity90 and @entity91 to push for a first - innings lead .			0

@entity26 face @entity4 in the first test on *wednesday* in @entity95
@entity2 built partnerships with @entity18 and @entity17 at @entity7
