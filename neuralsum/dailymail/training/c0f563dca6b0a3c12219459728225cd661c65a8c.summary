nothing comes between a sea lion and their fish			0
a group of tourists enjoying a lovely boat ride in @entity7 , @entity8 , got a rather delightful surprise when a sea lion began chasing down the boat , this as they were travelling 25mph in the @entity13			2
things got even crazier however when one of the skippers on the boat opened the back of the vessel , and the sea lion hopped on - board			1
and so he got a nice big catch from the skipper , and then headed back into the ocean			0
feed me : it was not a social call however , as the sea lion was actually looking for some of the fish he saw on the boat getting it in : the lion looks delighted after being tossed a fish bidding farewell : having been fed and no doubt exhausted from following the boat , the lion leaves to go eat it is not certain if this sea lion is the infamous @entity58 , known for chasing boats around and snatching fishes , but no mater who it is , they are very well fed right now			1
@entity58 meanwhile did strike recently , being captured on video as he snuck up on two fisherman proudly showing off their catches and snatched one right out of a man 's hands .			0

a *hungry* sea lion chased down a boat going 25mph in @entity7 , surprising everyone when he *suddenly* hopped on - board
the sea lion was after some fish , and once he was tossed one immediately went back out into the water
this sea lion may be @entity58 , the infamous *animal* who is known to chase down boats in search of fish around the area
