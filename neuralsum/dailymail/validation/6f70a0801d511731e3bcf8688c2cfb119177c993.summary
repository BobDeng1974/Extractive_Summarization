@entity0 made yet another of his trademark gaffes today as he met @entity3 's prime minister to mark @entity4 - then suggested one side of its sectarian divide was unwelcome in @entity8			1
sporting a green tie and noticing that everyone else was also wearing one , or clad in green , he suddenly blurted : ' anyone wearing orange is not welcome in here			1
' the purported joke was a reference to @entity19 's religious and political divide which was at the heart of the @entity21 , the violence which killed 3,000 from the late 1960s until the start of the millennium			1
@entity25 is the color associated with the @entity28 majority in @entity3 , and overcoming sectarian tensions has been a major part of the effort to bring peace to the once - deeply troubled province			1
@entity36 , the @entity19 prime minister – whose official title is @entity37 – and his wife @entity36 , the guests of honour , both laughed nervously			1
they said nothing , but continued to smile for the cameras			0
the vice president made a joke about sectarianism and got her name wrong i 'm with ... : vice president @entity0 points at shamrock worn in his breast pocket to mark @entity4 after a brief pause , mr @entity0 declared : ' only joking			1
' he then welcomed the @entity56 , @entity58 ambassador @entity57 and the @entity19 entourage into the @entity60 in @entity8 , his official residence			2
the @entity62 made no further reference to his blurted - out bad joke , but at one point in his breakfast remarks appeared to refer to the @entity37 's wife as ' @entity68 ' , although he subsequently corrected it to @entity70			1
@entity71 traditionally wear orange during their annual summer parades , while green is used as a symbol by mostly @entity58 nationalists and is a theme of @entity4 celebrations around the world			0
in @entity3 , there was an immediate demand from a senior unionist for an apology			2
' whether they were intended as a joke or not , the comments are a slur on those who would be known as ' orange ' i.e. @entity28 , ' said the @entity89 , a member of the @entity91 parliament for the @entity92			2
' when @entity3 is making such an effort to make @entity4 an inclusive celebration , @entity0 's comments were disgraceful and careless , ' he added			1
asked about the request for an apology , an official in @entity0 's office said the vice president had made clear that he was joking			2
@entity0 's mother , @entity101 , was of @entity19 origin			1
her ancestors had moved to @entity3 in the wake of the potato famine			2
the vice president made another minor blunder later when he read a quote from a @entity110 poem he described as ' @entity111 ' , when the word sunday is not in the title			1
the poem was about the @entity115 , when @entity19 rebels began a violent attempt to force @entity19 to become independent from the @entity91 , which succeeded five years later			2
it actually broke out the next day , @entity111 monday , april 24 of that year			0
the use of @entity111 would materially affect the subject of the poem , best known for its phrase ' a terrible beauty is born '			0
he described @entity110 as ' a @entity28 hero in a predominantly @entity58 country			2
' he then told the @entity37 : ' you 've become a close friend and i admire you a great deal			0
' laughing : despite the gaffe , @entity19 prime minister @entity36 laughed with mr @entity0 mr @entity0 also revealed that he had a stammer as a child			1
' my uncle , @entity133 , a bachelor , used to sleep in the same room as my brother and i. i used to stutter very badly when i was a kid			0
but at night @entity133 used to recite the poetry of @entity110			0
and i would get up and recite in front of a mirror , and try to learn not to contort my face when i spoke and stuttered			0
' mr @entity0 has a long list of previous gaffes – he once asked a wheelchair - bound local politician to stand up and acknowledge the crowd 's applause , and after being chosen as vice president he even suggested that @entity148 would have been a better choice			1
most recently he was widely ridiculed for putting his hands on the shoulders of @entity152 , wife of defense secretary @entity153 , and whispering in her ear as her husband was sworn in			0
he also told the father of a teenage girl – @entity161 @entity160 senator @entity159 's grandaughter @entity158 – that he hoped he had a ' big fence ' as @entity159 was sworn in			0
five years ago , @entity0 incorrectly suggested at a @entity4 reception that the mother of then @entity19 prime minister @entity165 was dead , saying ' @entity166 rest her soul ' , before correcting himself to say ' @entity166 bless her soul '			1
at today 's @entity8 event the @entity37 presented the vice president with a book of @entity110 ' poetry , but told him he should not open it for at least another 25 years , ' when you are old and grey and nodding by the fire			1
' he then invited mr @entity177 to play a round of golf in @entity3 - the fifth time he has done so , with no success so far			2
mr @entity36 joked : ' the golf courses are still there			0
and they are in better condition than they have been for many years			0
so welcome home , @entity101			0
' mr @entity0 replied that last year the @entity37 had tried to intercede for him with the president , telling him , ' you got ta let him go			0
you got ta let @entity0 go			0

@entity0 was supposed to be *greeting* @entity19 prime minister @entity36 in @entity8 to mark feast of @entity19 's *patron* saint
blurted out ' anyone wearing orange is not welcome here ' – a reference to traditional color of largely @entity199 in @entity200
senior @entity28 politician from @entity3 demands apology from vice-president
also got name of @entity19 prime minister 's wife wrong and mis - named the title of a @entity110 poem he *selected* for the *occasion*
