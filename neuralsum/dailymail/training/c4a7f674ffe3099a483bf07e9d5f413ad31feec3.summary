a @entity1 man fed up with his ' lemon ' car has started an online campaign to raise funds to destroy it			2
@entity9 has started a @entity11 campaign to raise $ 22,500 , the amount @entity8 offered to him to buyback the car , and allows those who donate the chance to be involved in the car 's destruction			1
for $ 12 supporters can have their name written in permanent marker on the car before it is smashed up , $ 22 will buy someone a go at the car with a sledge hammer , $ 250 will enable someone to destroy the engine and $ 5,000 grants someone the right to set fire to the jeep at the end of the process			1
so far the campaign , destroy my jeep , has 39 backers who have pledged more than $ 1,600 between them mr @entity9 said he is taking extreme measures after years of frustration with his ' cursed ' @entity52 , which in the four years since he bought it in 2010 has had all number of problems , including the fuel line falling off , coolant leaks , the rear strut leaking oil , ongoing ignition failure , and the turbo inlet manifold cracking			1
' things happen with cars , but you should n't have 20 things wrong with it , requiring four tow trucks and a push [ when the car broke down before he even got it out of the showroom ] , ' he told @entity73			0
mr @entity9 insists he has never driven it off - road and that the car has only done 12,000km , a number disputed by @entity8 who say it has driven 30,000 to 40,000km			1
mr @entity9 said he ' tried everything possible the right way ' to get a resolution from @entity8 , contacting the dealer , importer , @entity84 and the @entity85			1
mr @entity9 is hoping that people will pay for the fun of destroying his car , which he says is ' cursed ' and a ' lemon ' mr @entity9 said he wanted to shoot the jeep with guns but that 's illegal in @entity93 and so people will have to settle for bow and arrow assaults on the vehicle the @entity99 project was started after mr @entity9 felt he had exhausted all formal options of communication with @entity8 @entity8 offered mr @entity9 a settlement of $ 22,500 for the car , for which he originally paid $ 49,000 , and he knows that if he sold the car himself he could get $ 28,000 for it , but he says he feels uncomfortable with both options			1
' it 's become a matter of principle for me , if i take their money , they 're going to on - sell the car at a profit and someone 's going to end up with my lemon and i just do n't think that 's right			0
' i might as well try and find some lighter side to the whole thing			0
' the @entity11 campaign is a way of doing just that , as well as putting pressure on big companies who think they can bully unhappy customers into giving up , he said			1
' i 'm just really disappointed in their lack of want to resolve this issue and i certainly tried all the formal ways to resolve this			0
' i guess in this day and age of social media it puts pressure on companies to do the right thing by their customers and i 'm really hoping they review their policies			0
' mr @entity9 adds that he has ' never done anything like this before ' and does not think all jeeps are faulty			2
' i do n't think it 's all @entity143 , it 's just there 's something systemically wrong with this one			0
' once the destruction of the @entity143 has taken place , mr @entity9 says he just wants to put this chapter behind him			2
he will have to buy a replacement car and while he is not certain which model he 'll purchase he does know one thing			0
' it wo n't be a jeep			0

@entity9 started a @entity11 campaign to get people involved in destroying his car
for $ 55 you can pay for the right to shoot a bow and arrow at the jeep
$ 5,000 means you can set the chassis on fire
