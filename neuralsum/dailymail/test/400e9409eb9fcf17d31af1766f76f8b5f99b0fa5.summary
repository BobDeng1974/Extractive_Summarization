a cross-dressing @entity2 television star 's robotic clone has made its ' unnervingly real ' on - screen debut - the first android to host its own show			1
@entity2 engineers , who are trying to replace celebrities with human - like androids , have pushed the clone of transvestite entertainer @entity10 into the limelight			1
the late - night television personality shared the stage with his ' @entity15 ' doppelganger for the first time on saturday night			1
mr @entity34 , who is popular in @entity2 for his frankness , said it was ' fascinating ' come face - to - face with his lookalike			1
' i see myself as other people see me for the first time , and it was a significant moment , ' he added			0
working with world - famous roboticist @entity44 , @entity2 ’s top advertising agency , @entity43 dreamed up the idea to clone an exact android copy of the rotund entertainer			1
a spokesman for the agency said : ' artists and entertainers themselves are n’t yet seen as content that can be combined with technology , but the @entity43 group believes the need to develop android entertainers will grow			0
' performing with natural movements , while voiced and controlled remotely by a voice impersonator , the robot was put through its paces in front of an incredulous audience for the first time on @entity67			0
for now , the @entity69 robot is controlled by an human operator			1
but with @entity74 ' phases it can use in reply to voice and face recognition , it 's hoped the @entity15 will be free of its operator by the end of the series as it learns on the job			0
@entity44 ’s science lab used the latest silicon skin and state - of - the - art electronic actuators to achieve a lifelike look			2
creating the android : @entity15 robot was developed at a cost of around £ 55,931 by the @entity2 labs finishing touches : @entity2 ’s top make - up artist was brought in to apply the finishing touches to @entity69 @entity2 ’s top make - up artist was brought in to finish the job of making the bot glamorous			1
observers said the effect was realistic enough to go beyond the creepy			0
mr @entity44 said : ' because of advances in robotics , difficulty in telling man and machine apart could soon become reality			0
' @entity105 is the first humanoid robot designed to live with humans looking slightly put out by his new , unpaid rival , the star - one of @entity2 's most overworked entertainers - said he was looking forward to ' using the robot to take a few well deserved days off '			1
despite the jokes , the android could be part of trend that has a more sober side			0
according to research company @entity117 , one in three jobs will be replaced by some kind of software , robot or smart machine by 2025			1
@entity15 was developed at a cost of around £ 55,931 by the @entity2 labs that already produced an autonomous experimental news - reader			1
the theory goes that as robots start to look more human , people will become more sympathetic towards them			2
but with many @entity2 already predisposed to being sympathetic to robots , because of the friendly way they are portrayed in @entity2 popular culture , mr @entity34 said he noticed his fans were more inclined to approach his clone rather than himself			1
during the recording of @entity33 , one young fan even declared his love for mr @entity34 through the robot and planted a kiss on the bot 's thin , lipsticked - mouth during saturday ’s programme			2
@entity142 , the creative genius behind a raft of entertainment robots including the remarkable @entity105 , wants to spearhead a robotics revolution for the consumer , where entertainment robots are just the start			2
mr @entity34 , who is popular in @entity2 for his frankness , said : ' i see myself as other people see me for the first time , and it was a significant moment ' @entity44 ’s science lab used the latest silicon skin and state - of - the - art electronic actuators to achieve a lifelike look collaboration : world - famous roboticist @entity44 ( left ) , worked with @entity2 ’s top advertising agency , @entity43 the advertising company recently launched the @entity164 to tackle the new business which it says will be a ' new industrial revolution , second only to the internet '			1
currently , the domestic robot market is worth about 900 billion yen ( about £ 5billion ) according to @entity2 ’s trade ministry , which forecasts a 10-fold increase by 2035			2
@entity43 also helped develop the first robot in space @entity172 – a 13 - inch tall humanoid robot - which it plans to adapt as another personal entertainment drone			2
it was announced earlier this year that from this summer , the world ’s first hotel staffed by robots will be opened in @entity2			1
chillingly life - like robots are causing a storm in @entity2 – where their creators are about to launch them as actresses , full - size mechanical copies for pop idol fans , and clones of the dearly departed			1
there is even talk that the naturalistic , even engaging she - droids may be taken up as men as partners in the not - too - distant future			2
android @entity193 was a star attraction at @entity195 last year and she is one of a series of geminoids , as their inventor dubs them , that are ripe for commercialisation says their creator - robotics professor @entity44			2
chillingly life - like robots are causing a storm in @entity2 – where their creators are about to launch them as actresses and full - size mechanical copies for pop idol fans android @entity193 was a star attraction at @entity195 last year			1
she relies on a camera rigged behind her that is relayed to a remote human controller to give her life @entity193 is so convincing that many bowed respectfully before requesting politely to take her photo or join a selfie			0
unable , for now , to use some of the advanced artificial intelligence ( @entity218 ) , face and voice recognition systems that some @entity2 robots coming on the market now use , @entity193 relies on a camera rigged behind her that is relayed to a remote human controller to give her life			1
this so - called tele - presence enables @entity193 to come alive , taking on the operator ’s personality			0
a fully independent version of the geminoid is expected in 10 years using all the above technologies to make her virtually indistinguishable from humans says @entity235 , ceo of @entity236 in @entity237 , the company working with prof. @entity44 to make @entity193 and her kind commercial			0
previous attempts by @entity243 's team had been dismissed as unconvincing and prone to what is known as the ' @entity246 syndrome '			0
this is a term coined by another @entity2 professor of robotics , @entity248			2
it describes the response of revulsion and creepiness when faced with something that looks almost , but somehow not quite , human			0
as robots become as dexterous as @entity193 at mimicking humanity , so the theory goes , the syndrome will erase itself			0
' @entity260 for the sex industry are a definite possibly ' already @entity193 and other androids from @entity263 have had a taste of the limelight , appearing on stage and voicing actors lines using tele - presence			1
@entity263 also hopes to tap into another big business in @entity2 - the popularity of fantasy figurines that appeal to @entity2 ’s legions of nerdy men or ' otaku '			1
as @entity263 is working with highly respected prof. @entity44 , mr @entity235 says the company has ruled out producing androids that might be used for sex			0
but a spokesman working with @entity44 ’s lab says it is not a great leap of imagination to think similar robots , given the advancement in robotics and silicone skin technology , will be used for sex			0
' physical relations will be possible in general with such androids , ' said @entity292			0
' @entity260 for the sex industry are a definite possibly			0
some have even fallen in love with @entity44 ’s geminoids			0
so we ca n't rule those relationships out			0
