by @entity0 published : 06:50 est , 9 august 2013 updated : 09:48 est , 9 august 2013 with their florid complexions , thick woollen coats and mutton chop whiskers , there 's no doubting the men in these portraits come from the @entity9 industrial age			1
but while these 19th century workers from the @entity13 valleys look typical , they were in fact far from it , thanks to their unusually humane boss			1
eccentric ironmaster @entity17 rejected the trappings of his wealthy family to live amongst his workers , learning @entity13 so he could talk to them and even having their portraits painted for posterity			1
rare glimpse into the characters of @entity26 's industrial age : @entity27 , left , was a roller in the works while @entity30 , right , was a manager at the tin mills owned by the wealthy eccentric @entity17 @entity33 carpenter @entity32 wore a wool suit , while cinder filler @entity35 is pictured with a shovel @entity17 's egalitarian relationship with his staff , astounding in an age when industrialists were known for their ruthless and often inhumane treatment of staff , is revealed in an exhibition of the portraits at the @entity46 in @entity47			1
it features the oil portraits of 16 of @entity17 's favourite employees at his family 's ironworks in @entity53 , in the @entity54 , and tinplate works at @entity56 , near @entity57			1
@entity58 industrialist @entity17 shunned the trappings of his wealthy family and instead cultivated close relationships with his staff in the @entity13 valleys the museum 's @entity62 said : ' @entity17 maintained unusually close personal relationships with his employees and was an unusually humane industrialist			1
' he commissioned 16 small portraits of his employees and no other such images of industrial workers are known			1
this seems to be a unique group of individual workers of the period			0
' @entity17 was the third generation of a family who made a fortune from the booming iron trade in @entity9 south @entity13 , and he grew up in great style in @entity80 , @entity81 - then the iron capital of the world			1
unlike most tycoons of the day , however , the eccentric @entity17 chose to live alongside the staff who manned the family 's works			1
while most local ironmasters exploited their staff , who lived in squalid conditions and worked long hours for little pay , it was different for those who worked for a @entity17 mine			2
son of the great ironmaster @entity97 , @entity17 was known as ' mr @entity98 ' to his workers and even learnt @entity13 so that he could speak to them in their own language			1
an art lover , he treated them as equals and became so close that he commissioned travelling portrait artist @entity103 to paint them in oils between 1835 - 1840			2
while the wealthy of the ear sometimes commissioned portraits of domestic servants and estate workers , these are the only known paintings of industrial workers , and unlike the massaged portraits of nobility from the time , the portraits show the men in the raw			1
mr @entity62 said : ' although a number of 18th and 19th century country servant portraits are known this seems to be a unique group of individual images of industrial workers of the period			2
' the men pictured worked at either the @entity53 ironworks , pictured , or a tinplate works at @entity56 , @entity57 @entity130 @entity129 , left , is pictured with one of his tools while smith @entity133 wears an apron @entity135 @entity17 left , while mechanic @entity136 does n't look like those who do his job today , right family grandeur : @entity17 's father @entity140 built this to be their home near @entity81 in the 1820s agent @entity144 was painted according to the wishes of his industrialist boss , as was @entity35 , right @entity147 , a mine agent , stares unblinkingly at the artist , while storekeeper @entity149 , right , looks away skilled and unskilled workers were painted , young and old , and all are depicted standing in a landscape , in working clothes and with the tools of their trade			1
tin roller @entity27 is gripping a large clamp used to handle molten tin , while @entity35 holds a long pole used in the iron - making process			0
those pictured include a foreman , a lodge keeper , carpenter and tin roller , among many other characters who kept the @entity17 coffers bursting			0
both @entity168 , left , and lodge keeper @entity169 , who had a glint in his eye , needed a stick to walk favoured employees : @entity174 , left , was chosen to be painted as was this unnamed man , right now the 170 - year - old pictures have been handed over to the museum in @entity47 by @entity17 's ancesters for an exhibition that runs until september 22			2
@entity17 , who was married with eight children , preferred not to live in the big family house and instead built himself a small cottage to live in			2
he became interested in druids and built his own druidic circle near the house , while he left following the closure of the @entity53 and @entity56 works in 1859 and 1867 , to retire @entity187 where it was said he enjoyed walking around in nautical dress			0
@entity17 died in 1878 aged 67			0
regarded as one of the cradles of the @entity192 , @entity81 was the iron capital of the world for much of the 19th century			2
as industry boomed in the valleys , what was a village of just 40 homes in 1760s turned into a sprawling town that was home to almost 8,000 people by 1801			0
but while the metal and coal mines that sparked the boom may have brought joy to the overlords who made their fortunes from them , life for those who worked in them was a very different matter			0
lured from farms across @entity13 by the prospect of steady work , workers lived four or five to a one - room stone house , often built on top of iron slag heaps			2
scenic view : life in @entity81 170 years ago was a struggle - disease was rife , conditions were squalid and many ironmasters exploited their staff conditions in what came to be known as @entity229 were just that : with no toilets , the streets were open sewers and diseases such as cholera and typhoid were rife			0
lice were common amongst the workers who worked and slept side by side in cramped conditions			0
ironmasters provided housing for their employees , but they were squalid slums , and life expectancy was low with a high rate of infant mortality			0
the factory and mine managers were often cruel towards their staff - rights were unheard of and hours were long			0
many paid their staff with company tokens that could only be spent in their own , company - controlled shops called ' truck shops ' , where prices were inflated by as much as 10 per cent			0
in the midst of all this , @entity17 and his philanthropy stood out like a beacon , and he refused to exploit his staff as so many of contemporaries were .			0
