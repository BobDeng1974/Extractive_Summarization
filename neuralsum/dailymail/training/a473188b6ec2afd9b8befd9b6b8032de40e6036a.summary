@entity0 hailed @entity2 ’s brilliance and insisted he is the man to fire @entity3 to @entity4			1
the revitalised @entity3 forward showed the benefits of a mid-season break in the @entity7 by scoring a magnificent goal to ensure the first leg of their @entity10 semi-final with @entity13 ended 1 - 1			1
after @entity14 had put @entity13 ahead with a penalty , @entity3 roared back and @entity2 scored a magnificent goal , waltzing past @entity17 and @entity18 before finishing confidently with his left foot			1
@entity2 's superb second - half strike means @entity3 's semi-final is firmly poised @entity2 watches on as his shot evades @entity23 and nestles into the far corner @entity2 celebrates his goal with @entity3 team - mate @entity26 and @entity27 only a string of superb saves from @entity23 kept @entity31 ’s team in the game – @entity3 had 20 shots compared to the six of @entity13 – and @entity0 has no doubt @entity3 are ready to go to @entity36 and win			1
@entity0 , who hopes @entity37 will be fit for the second leg , said : ‘ the rest has done him the world of good			2
he has that ability to move in behind but he can also exploit the space in front			0
‘ his speed was frightening to come in and finish , wonderful goal			0
we are getting better as each game goes on			0
this is a team that has done very well			0
we have to keep our focus and concentration and we will try to continue to perform in that way			0
@entity14 put the @entity54 ahead from the penalty spot before the break ‘ you see defensively how we were : aggressive , compact			1
@entity13 have got top - class players			1
i thought the performance was a benchmark			0
there is absolutely no doubt we can go to the second leg and get the performance we need to go through			0
’ @entity2 added : ‘ it ’s always good to get on the scoresheet and help the team out			2
i ’ve felt the benefit of the break because there are times you need a bit of rest and the manager gave me some time off and it ’s helped			2
we ’re still in the tie and @entity13 will be difficult but helpfully we can get a result			2
’ @entity0 felt referee @entity76 missed two big decisions , one when @entity78 appeared to handle in the area and another when @entity23 , returning after a three - match absence , carried the ball out of his area			2
that was the only blemish on @entity23 ’ outstanding display			0
@entity0 and @entity31 shake hands at the final whistle after the 1 - 1 draw at @entity88 @entity31 said : ‘ the @entity89 is full of top goalkeepers but we have the two best so for me it is so easy and to have both playing so well and giving so much confidence to the team the players do n’t care who plays			1
’ @entity13 ’s manager later appeared to take a dig at @entity3 for letting @entity98 leave when his contract expires			1
when asked if he would make a cheeky bid to sign him , @entity31 told 5 live : ' or perhaps to take him on loan ? i would love the @entity89 to keep the best players and i believe he has the quality to play for more years			0

@entity2 earned @entity3 1 - 1 draw against @entity13 at @entity88
@entity14 had given *visitors* first - half lead from the penalty spot
@entity2 struck after the break and earned *praise* from his boss afterwards
