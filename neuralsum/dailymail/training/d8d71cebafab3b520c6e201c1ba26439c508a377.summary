controversial comedian @entity0 has landed in the middle of his latest controversy accusing the @entity3 of terrorism just hours after 132 @entity6 children were murdered by the @entity7			1
@entity0 was interviewing @entity8 , a @entity9 who was detained at @entity10 when he wrote : ' the people who do " terror " best are the people who decide what " terror " is			1
' the nine minute interview was posted on @entity16 and said it would ' lift the lid ' on @entity10 torture			1
not all the time but i 'm seeing it more and more			2
' another user , @entity39 claimed : ' i guess you have n't seen the news from @entity6 today yet			2
' @entity42 added : ' bad timing given what 's just happened in @entity6 dude			0
' @entity0 was attacking the @entity3 over their detention of @entity8 , who was held after being arrested in @entity6 in 2002			1
he was brought to @entity10 and released without charge in 2005			1
he spoke to mr @entity8 about his experiences at the hands of the @entity3 military and the @entity53 in @entity10 and @entity54 in @entity55			1
mr @entity8 said his interrogators asked him repeatedly about what was happening to his family when audio of a woman screaming was played in a different room			0
the former detainee said he was threatened with being sent to @entity63 or @entity64 , where prisoners were regularly tortured			0
in his interview , mr @entity0 said : ' language is so integral to our understanding of these issues			1
for or quite a while , i thought that waterboarding was just a hobby			1
they 're just doing some waterboarding , oh that 's nice , some time off between the torture			2
' in a monologue at the end of his latest broadcast , @entity0 claimed : ' if we have a criminal government , none of us are free			1
if our freedom is contingent on total compliance , then none of us are free			0
if people are being tortured in our names or the names of the institutions that govern us , then none of us are free			0
it is ironic that the people that do terror best are the people who decide what terror is			1
' he had earlier become embroiled in the @entity99 terrorist outrage , by claiming that man @entity100 was not a terrorist			0
@entity0 said : '' by us labelling him a terrorist rather than a dangerous mentally ill person - not that all mentally ill people are dangerous , i 'm mentally ill - and by allowing him to set the agenda " i 'm doing this on behalf of @entity117 " it gives a certain grandeur to nihilistic and violent actions but what 's more interesting than the actions of a mentally ill person is the response of the political establishment , ' he continued			2
the comedian also blamed the media for fitting the story into their own frame , amid worldwide fears about @entity124			0
' it 's convenient for people to enhance and increase fear around @entity128 because currently there 's an appetite to increase security measures domestically , to engage in foreign military activity in that region of the world for economic and corporate ends			0
' several @entity24 users immediately attacked @entity0 's @entity24 because of the ongoing situation in @entity6 brand criticised media reports that claimed gunman man @entity100 was a terrorist with links to @entity128 @entity100 kept 18 people captive for many hours until police stormed the cafe in the early hours of tuesday brand dispersed @entity147 news reports and addresses from mr @entity149 in between his statements , and made the claim that terrorism is more a structure upheld by governments as a tool of power than anything else			1
' terrorism is continually used as a tool to control a domestic population			0
i 'm not saying there are n't a lot of dangerous people out there , i 'm saying a lot of those people are in government , ' he said			0
@entity147 's new terror and metadata laws were also up for discussion , with @entity0 saying giving authorities the immunity from prosecution is very dangerous , especially in light of recent information surrounding the @entity53 and torture claims			1
brand also claimed prime minister @entity149 and the government used the situation to fit their own framework but he did acknowledge that ' we ' need to pull together in times such as these he however ended his bulletin on a more positive note , saying the # illridewithyou hashtag was ' an offer of solidarity '			2
' we have at this point got to pull together more than ever , when people control the media like @entity193 who says things like " @entity63 being white , all the @entity63 i know are white " , ' of course what 's happened in @entity147 is sad and of course there 's dangerous things going on in the world but our media uses that danger to suit their ends			0
' it 's really important in this time of division and fear that we embrace one another			0
us , the normal people in the middle , embrace one another			0
forget the extremists are either end of the social scale , whether they are motivated by religion or money or desire for power , and us , the ordinary people that want to make connections , have a right and a duty , in fact , to define the way we see reality , ' @entity0 concluded .			2

@entity0 has criticised the @entity3 in his latest @entity24 rant
he said those who do terror best are those who decide what terror is
he was interviewing a @entity9 detained at @entity10 for three years
brand said he thought waterboarding was a type of hobby
