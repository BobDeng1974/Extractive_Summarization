by @entity0 @entity1 says she very much enjoyed her kissing scenes with @entity3 in their new movie @entity4 @entity1 seems to be suffering some sort of mid-life romantic crisis			1
first she pronounced that dancing with prince @entity7 was ' better than sex ' , then she told us all how the perm she 'd had for her role as @entity13 author @entity12 in movie saving mr @entity14 had put a serious dent in her love life			1
now , she 's positively drooling over @entity3 , her co-star in comedy heist movie @entity4			1
' we play a divorced couple and had some kissing scenes to do , ' explains @entity1			1
' i just kept messing up the scene in so many different ways , as often as i could , because @entity3 was such a good kisser and i did n't want the scene to end			1
when we finally got it right , @entity3 turned to me and said , “ have we been kissing all day ? ” and i said , rather sheepishly , “ well yes , i rather think we have			1
” ' but how can you resist @entity3 ? ! he has an enormous amount of glamour but he 's also very surprising to the point where you suddenly expect him to whip out some knitting			1
he has the most extraordinary grace			1
he 's like a ballerina , he has this remarkable way of moving and yet he can also sit there and do the crossword and be very normal			2
' ' you ca n't really be a movie star if you ca n't walk or run and some people just ca n't			2
i do n't mean they ca n't get about , they obviously can , but you do n't want to watch them moving about because they are n't attractive when they do so , they do n't do it with grace			2
that 's why he was such a successful @entity51			2
watching him move in that role was so wonderful			2
' @entity1 - looking younger than her 54 years - is cast as @entity53 , the ex-wife of @entity3 's character @entity54 in @entity4			1
the couple have been divorced for eight years following @entity54 's numerous affairs but are brought together again by unfortunate circumstances			2
' @entity54 's company is stripped of its assets			2
all their income that 's paying for their children 's education , the mortgages on their respective homes , is taken from them , ' explains @entity1			1
' they join forces to try and gain revenge on the businessman who asset - stripped the company and who 's spent £ 10 million on a diamond for his fiancée			2
stealing the gem , and selling it , would solve @entity54 and @entity53 's financial problems so they travel to @entity77 to try and pinch it			2
' @entity1 with her husband @entity79 at an after party for the @entity81 of saving mr @entity14 aided and abetted by their best friends @entity86 ( @entity85 and @entity87 ) , they become unlikely burglars , intent on stealing back the diamond by whatever means necessary			1
working as @entity92 versions of @entity93 also reawakens the passion between them , although even at the beginning of the movie there 's not a lot of animosity between @entity54 and @entity53			2
' the truth is , she 's more amused by his failed relationships with much younger women than upset by them			2
she thinks he 's nicer than he used to be and much less of a twit			0
' there was an earlier draft of the script where the couple had only been divorced for a short while and there was still a lot of rage and pain between them			0
but i think this works better , it 's lighter and it 's funnier			0
this movie is about lifting people 's spirits and @entity125 knows that 's what we all need from time to time ! ' also , i wonder whether we have n't stumbled on something important here			0
@entity54 and @entity53 have taken a proper break from their marriage , a beneficial break , and i wonder whether this is n't the way forward for a lot of married couples ? you look at it and think that maybe every marriage should have a kind of sabbatical , that couples should be forced to take a break from each other every so often , if just for a year or so			1
it 's actually not a bad idea			0
' ' you look at it and think that maybe every marriage should have a kind of sabbatical , that couples should be forced to take a break from each other every so often			1
it 's actually not a bad idea			0
' she 's warming to her theme now			0
' you need to go off perhaps , although not to be with other people			0
i think that would make things very difficult : that free love stuff has been tried and tested and does n't work and has been proven to make relationships very , very tricky			0
but i 'm sure a sabbatical could work if it were done properly			0
it 's about two people who know each other very , very well coming back together again and loving each other in a different kind of way second time around			0
' so is @entity171 of taking a sabbatical from her own marriage to actor @entity79 , whom she met when they were both appearing in the 1995 movie @entity177 ? ' oh no , ' she says , looking somewhat shocked			1
' i 'm not talking about myself , i 'm talking in general terms about long - term relationships			0
' she 's equally matter - of - fact on the subject of holding grudges , the kind that drive @entity53 and @entity54 to seek revenge in @entity4			1
@entity1 and @entity3 as @entity53 and @entity54 in @entity4 twice an @entity188 winner for her performance in @entity190 in 1992 and for her script for @entity177 , you might imagine there are people in @entity1 's life against whom she might legitimately hold a grudge			1
@entity198 , perhaps , her first husband , whose affair with actress @entity200 on the set of @entity202 put the skids under his marriage to @entity1 in the early 90s ? but no , she says , grudges just are n't her thing			1
' i do n't hold grudges			0
i really ought to hold them slightly more - i 'm rubbish at them			0
it 's actually one of my best qualities , not to hold grudges			0
i have many vile characteristics but that 's quite a nice one			0
frankly , i have n't got the energy			0
it takes a lot of energy to hold on to grudges and i do n't really see the point of them			0
' what she does see the point of is making a sequel to @entity4 , if the opportunity arises			1
she clearly had a ball filming this first movie , which was shot entirely on location in @entity77			0
' i was surprised , in particular , at how much i enjoyed all the action scenes , whether it was playing beach volleyball , slipping into a rubber diving suit or driving a car very fast through the streets of @entity235			1
the highlight was definitely the driving			0
' i was allowed to do a lot of it and i had @entity3 sitting next to me in the passenger seat as i manoeuvred this car down a very steep flight of steps			1
he was genuinely frightened at the prospect of tipping over			0
imagine that ! stunt driving with an @entity51 beside you , and he 's the one that 's frightened ! ' i 've definitely got the taste for a full - on action movie now			0
maybe , if enough people come to see this film and it makes enough money , we could do a sequel where @entity86 and @entity257 are on holiday in some exotic location , and @entity54 and @entity53 have to rescue them from pirates ? i 'd be keen to do that			1
' @entity0 the @entity4 is in cinemas from friday and will be available on dvd and blu - ray from 18 august .			1

@entity1 returns to cinema screens in a new film @entity4
here she tells us about kissing scenes with the *irresistible* @entity3
she says that a break from marriage can be a beneficial thing
