the world 's oldest mummies buried more than 7,000 years ago in the arid desert of northern @entity3 are being turned into black slime by climate change			1
scientists have found that growing humidity can cause an explosion of bacteria living on the preserved skin of the @entity12 mummies			1
the bacteria then feeds on the ancient skin , causing it to break down into a black slime			1
the preserved skin on the outside of @entity12 in @entity18 , northern @entity3 , have begun to rapidly degrade as bacteria and humid air is turning it into black slime , as can be seen in the photograph above researchers say that rising humidity levels in @entity18 , @entity3 , is putting the 120 @entity12 at the @entity26 's archaeological museum at risk			1
however , they warn that hundreds of other mummies buried just beneath the sandy surface in the valleys throughout the region are also under threat			1
while some of the earliest mummies found in the @entity37 desert appear to have been the result of natural preservation in the extremely dry conditions , around 5,000 @entity41 , the @entity12 people began deliberately preserving their dead			1
although the practice began 2,000 years before the @entity44 began mummifying their own dead , the techniques used by the @entity12 were often surprisingly sophisticated			2
they would often take the most care when preserving the remains of dead children and babies - suggesting the act had a deep significance with linking the living to the dead			0
first the @entity12 would extract the brains and organs before then reconstructing the body with fibres			2
they would fill the empty skull with straw or ash			0
reeds were then used to sew it back together and connect the jaw to the cranium			0
a stick was used to keep the spine straight and the skin was patched back together before being covered with a paste made from manganese , red ocher or mud			0
professor @entity72 , an archaeologist at the @entity26 , said : ' in the last 10 years , the process has accelerated			0
' it is very important to get more information about what ’s causing this and to get the university and national government to do what ’s necessary to preserve the @entity12 for the future			2
' the @entity12 mummies are in some cases nearly 4,000 years older than those found preserved from ancient @entity85			1
the oldest mummy discovered in the @entity37 desert dates to @entity88 while the oldest in @entity85 dates to @entity90			2
however , the practice of preserving the dead with mummification became popular among the @entity94 around 5,000 @entity41 , with children and babies often being the most elaborately preserved			0
the @entity12 were a prehistoric people who lived in scattered communities and used fishing to help them survive on the desert coast of @entity3 and @entity101			1
it is thought they began preserving their dead though mummification as part of a religious act designed to bridge the world between the living and the dead			0
an estimated 282 mummies have now been recovered from the dry , sandy soil in the region , but scientists say there could be hundreds more buried there			1
preserved corpses are often found as the shifting sand exposes their bodies			2
@entity18 and the surrounding @entity37 is one of the driest places in the world and the town receives less than 0.02 inches of rain a year			0
the skin on the head of this @entity12 at the @entity124 in @entity18 , @entity3 has begun to break down due to the damage being caused by bacteria growing as humidity in the area increases the mummies were found buried in the arid desert valleys around @entity18 in northern @entity3 , shown on the map it is this dry climate that has helped preserve the mummies for more than 7,000 years			1
however , the region has been growing slowly damper in recent years			0
scientists at the @entity26 museum first noticed black slimy patches appearing on the preserved skin of the chinchorro mummies around ten years ago			1
as time has gone on they have degraded at ' an alarming rate ' as the preserved skin has broken down into a black slime			1
researchers at @entity145 have now conducted a series of tests to find out what was causing the degradation			0
they found that bacteria normally found growing on the human skin appeared to become ' supercharged ' when placed on mummy skin in high humidity			1
they found that mummies need to be kept at between 40 per cent and 60 per cent humidity to prevent degradation occurring			2
some of the @entity12 , like the one above buried in a coffin made from reeds , show highly sophisticated preservation thousands of years before mummification began to be used in ancient @entity85 if humidity falls below this level , acidification could also damage the mummies			1
museum staff are now fine tuning the temperature and humidity to help preserve the mummies in their extensive collection			0
professor @entity171 , a biologist at @entity145 who led the work , said : ' we knew the mummies were degrading but nobody understood why			0
' this kind of degradation has never been studied before			0
' with many diseases we encounter , the microbe is in our body to begin with , but when the environment changes it becomes an opportunist			0
' professor @entity171 and his colleagues are now keen to find ways to help protect the mummies still preserved out in the desert .			2

hundreds of mummies preserved and buried by ancient @entity12 people have been found in the arid sand of the @entity37 in northern @entity3
in the past ten years black *wet* patches have appeared on some mummies
scientists found bacteria on preserved skin is breaking the mummies down
rising humidity levels in the region have ' supercharged ' the skin bacteria
they are then causing the preserved skin to break down into black slime
scientists now hope to protect the mummies from suffering further damage
