benefits claimants should be banned from spending welfare handouts on alcohol and cigarettes , a @entity0 mp has said			2
@entity5 wants to prohibit benefits being spent on luxury items by introducing electronic cash cards which could only be used for essential items such as food and clothing			1
the cards would be similar to a chip and pin debit card but with a blocking function for non-essential items , the mp for @entity16 and @entity17 told the @entity20			2
essential swipe : the use of the card would be limited to necessary items such as food and clothing , effectively banning benefits claimants from buying booze and cigarettes if people on benefits were to be prohibited from buying non-essential , desirable and damaging ( @entity33 ) items , mr @entity5 believes the public 's perception of welfare claimants would improve			1
mr @entity5 , a parliamentary private secretary at the @entity37 , said the plan would end the ' damaging perception ' that those who claimed benefits were scroungers who sponge off the state			2
restricting benefits : @entity5 wants to limit benefits to essential items ' when hard - working families up and down the country are forced to cut back on such non-essential , desirable items it is right that taxpayer benefits be only used for essential purposes , ' mr @entity5 told the @entity20			1
although the @entity56 drafted by mr @entity5 has no realistic prospect of becoming law , the idea of benefits cash cards was raised by @entity60 secretary @entity59 during the @entity0 party conference earlier this year			1
@entity62 already uses a dedicated spending system where the ' basics cards ' scheme was launched nationwide in october			0
the cards can only be used to purchase ' priority ' items such as food , housing , clothing , education and health care			0
the government puts the money electronically on the card once a fortnight , when people receive their benefit payments			0
mr @entity5 said : ' if taxpayers are safe in the knowledge that claimants can no longer buy @entity33 at the taxpayers ' expense then the concept of welfare will be viewed once again as a responsible way of getting back on your feet			0
' ' that was what the welfare state was intended to be : a safety net in times of need , a hand - up , not simply a handout			0
