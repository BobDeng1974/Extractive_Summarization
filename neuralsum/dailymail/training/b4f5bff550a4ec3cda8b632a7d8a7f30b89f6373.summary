by @entity0 published : 17:58 est , 2 january 2013 updated : 19:04 est , 2 january 2013 research : a study by researchers at @entity4 and the @entity5 suggests a link between the increase in the number of roe deer in the @entity10 and a change in woodland foliage and bird populations the thriving population of @entity10 roe deer could be damaging the landscape of @entity18 woodland , according to a unique new study			1
researchers discovered that areas with the most roe deer had the least shrub layer vegetation cover and fewer birds			1
the study results add fuel to the argument that more wild deer need to be culled to protect the environment			2
a team from the @entity4 ( @entity4 ) and @entity5 found that an increase in the population of roe deer is possibly related to a decline in the diversity and cover of shrubs below the main canopy in forest areas			1
it is the first @entity10 - based study of its kind on a single species of deer			2
ecologists have long warned that the continued growth in numbers of wild deer could pose a long term threat to woodland			1
when presenting their findings at a recent @entity53 meeting in @entity54 , researchers said that they feared that if the population continues to grow it could lead to fewer nesting sites for a variety of species of birds and less food sources for other animals			2
the study was based on 35 woodland field sites from across @entity65 in may and june in 2011 and 2012			2
@entity66 , co-author of the study , told the @entity68 : ' much of the recent literature on impacts of deer on their environment has focused on multi-species systems and , there , authors can not attribute impacts they find on vegetation to one particular species			1
' population : the roe deer distribution in the @entity10 in 1972 , left , and in 2007 , right , shows the extent to which roe deer populations have grown			1
the red dots indicate the sites where the study took place growing numbers : the roe deer , pictured in @entity89 in 2011 , is native to the @entity10 and one of six species of deer that roam wild across @entity18 ' my study is the first in @entity18 which both looks solely at the roe deer , and within natural environments , ie without the use of deer enclosures where deer densities are artificially managed			1
' not only is the burgeoning population of wild deer a threat to @entity10 woodland			1
the surge in the number of deer is also a hazard for drivers on our roads : the roe deer , otherwise known as @entity113 , is a relatively small reddish and grey - brown deer			1
it is widespread across western @entity116			0
the species has seen a huge increase in numbers throughout the 20th and into the 21st century			0
the animal was extinct in much of southern @entity65 at the start of the 20th century , but numbers have since repopulated			0
@entity113 are mainly woodland deer , but in recent years the rise in numbers has led them to colonising more open areas such as rank heather , scrub and agricultural ground			0
they are herbivores and graze all types of ground vegetation			0
they also browse shrub layers in a wood , and the growing shoots and leaves of holly and beech trees			0
@entity140 rangers currently humanely manage roe populations			0
the latest study follows research from september which revealed that woodland without effective management systems aimed at controlling deer are more likely to be damaged by the animal			2
wild deer have been roaming @entity18 for around 6,000 years and it is estimated that there are currently around two million of them			0
there are six species present in the @entity10 - roe , red , fallow , muntjac , sika and @entity157 water deer - with the roe and red native to the @entity10 , the fallow present in @entity18 's woodlands since around the 11th century and the @entity163 , @entity164 and @entity157 water deer all introduced in recent centuries			0
overrun : the study results will add fuel to the argument that more wild deer need to be culled each year in order to protect other wildlife the muntjac deer for example was introduced to @entity174 but escaped in 1925 leading to the deer 's presence in the wild			0
experts from the @entity179 , an organisation which has been looking at sustainable management of deer since 1995 , recommend that around 20 per cent of the wild deer population in the @entity10 should be culled - that 's around 400,000 animals			2
the @entity185 warned in 2011 that bird species such as the nightingale and willow tit were in danger of dying out because of the increasing number of wild deer			0
sparse : the understorey or shrub layer vegetation cover is low in areas with high roe deer populations a study has found			1

researchers find link between increased roe deer population and decline of woodland vegetation
the study by @entity4 and @entity5 is first of its kind
ecologists have long warned that deers are a threat to woodland
