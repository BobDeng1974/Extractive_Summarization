] ' [ @entity49 ] hey took me to the " @entity51 " headquarters in the city , and escorted me to the torture chamber , then they asked me to choose between a whip or a " biter " [			2
] ' i did not know what a " biter " was and i thought it is a reduced sentence , i was afraid of whipping , so i choose the " biter " , then they brought a sharp object that has a a lot of teeth and held me , placing it on my chest and pressing it strongly , i screamed from pain and i was badly injured			0

britons including privately - educated @entity96 , 20 , and @entity98 - born @entity97 , 22 , are understood to have joined , helping to patrol @entity16 with guns and daggers hidden beneath their robes			1
the group operates as an ultra-oppressive police force monitoring the behaviour of females in @entity16 - meting out brutal punishments to anyone wearing shoes that are n't black , or those wearing veils made from the wrong material			1

] ' [ @entity223 ] uring the three nights i spent at the headquarters , i heard the screams of women and men who @entity29 was torturing			0
