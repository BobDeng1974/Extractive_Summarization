there has been talk of @entity2 leaving @entity3 in january , but if his @entity5 performance is anything to go by , maybe @entity7 should try and keep him			2
@entity9 visited @entity3 this week , and set @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity2 a challenge , whereby they were instructed to kick a football through tyres lined up in the top corner of a goal			1
@entity2 has found appearances hard to come by for the @entity18 this season , but in the challenge between him and his team - mates , it was the @entity23 forward that came out on top			1
video : watch the @entity27 at @entity3 's training ground the challenge saw two targets - one with a single tyre , and the other with four consecutive tyres the players initially struggled to send the ball through the targets , but @entity2 ( pictured ) won eventually there were two stages to the test - a single - tyre challenge , preceded by an infinitely more difficult four - tyre version			1
in the latter , it was @entity44 starlet @entity11 that impressed , firing a magnificent strike through all four consecutive tyres - and the ball did n't even touch the sides			1
the rest of the watching @entity3 squad could n't resist getting involved , as @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 and even goalie @entity50 piled in to have a go at the challenge - and , surprisingly , it was only the keeper that managed to score through the hole			2
in the one - tyre challenge , @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity2 all managed to fire a football through the target - eventually - although it was @entity2 who came out on top			1
@entity3 manager @entity7 watched on as the challenge took place @entity50 was one player who joined in to take a shot - and scored through the tyre @entity2 ( left ) and @entity11 ( right ) enjoyed the challenge , and celebrated by signifying hearts with their hands the only forward of the bunch , you would expect the @entity23 international to be up there when it comes to scoring , but @entity2 has been on the bench for the @entity18 this season and started a little rusty			2
after numerous attempts , it came down to a sudden death shoot - out between @entity11 and @entity82 vs @entity83 , midfield vs attack			0
and it was @entity2 who conquered			0
after making a love heart symbol with his hands , he high fived his @entity44 opponent as he celebrated the victory			0
his long - term future with @entity3 may be in doubt , but you never know ... maybe @entity7 was so impressed with his tyre challenge , that he 'll keep him in north @entity95 for a little while longer			0
want - away striker @entity2 eventually won the challenge , with two points to @entity11 's one an impressive camera angle shows the ball as it approaches the four - tyre target @entity12 ( right ) and @entity2 ( left ) are all smiles as they take part in the challenge @entity9 became the first “ @entity106 ” of @entity108 club , @entity3 , earlier this year			1
the partnership reflects the values that @entity111 and @entity3 share – a passion for performance and the drive for success			0
the multi-year deal will see the @entity9 , which has its @entity118 technical centre and headquarters in @entity120 , @entity121 , support the @entity95 club for at least the next five @entity108 seasons			0
the full video can be seen here : @entity126 the three players pose for the camera in the opening shot of the challenge			0

@entity9 visited @entity3 's training ground and set @entity2 , @entity11 and @entity12 the @entity5
@entity2 has found appearances hard to come by for @entity3 this season , but he came out on top in the challenge
the players were tested in two challenges - one with a single tyre *suspended* in the goal , and the other with four consecutive tyres
@entity11 produced a *stunning* strike , which saw his ball *fly* through the four consecutive tyres - and it did n't even touch the sides
