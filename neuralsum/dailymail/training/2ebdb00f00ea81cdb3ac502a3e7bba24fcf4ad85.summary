even though @entity0 is entitled to provide a written submission and deny the charge , he has no right of appeal if he is found guilty , which is likely considering the video footage of the incident			2

although the @entity6 manager stopped short of criticising the officials , he did claim that @entity0 should have been sent off			2
the @entity9 charge means @entity26 will have to turn to @entity108 or @entity109 to play up front as @entity2 attempt to extend their lead over their nearest challengers			1
@entity2 are also sweating on the fitness of midfielder @entity100 after he reported for treatment at the club 's training centre on wednesday			2

@entity137 analyst @entity136 repeatedly called @entity32 a ' bottler ' on air			0
on wednesday the @entity9 , who have fined @entity26 Â£ 25,000 for claiming there is a ' campaign ' against @entity2 , confirmed they will take no further action against the @entity145 coach			2

maybe you are already influenced by the campaign on television with certain pundits saying that @entity0 has committed a crime - the guy who says that must be nuts			2
' @entity97 calls it a crime , but he goes to the ball , he chases it , the opponent goes to the floor and he puts his foot there when he is looking at the ball			0
' it is a great campaign			0
we know how much that pundit loves @entity2			0
so he is sitting there , you are very well paid and you are a manager putting their ass on the bench and these guys have a good seat , earning a lot of money , no pressure			0
' they are never wrong , they have to be fair and they have to be honest			0
' @entity0 was also involved in another altercation with @entity6 captain @entity154 , but the case is closed because @entity32 booked the pair			2

although there were a number of other volatile incidents , the @entity9 are only looking at one more incident			0
@entity18 is alleged to have made hand gestures towards @entity2 supporters at the final whistle , but the @entity9 can not rely on still images to charge him with misconduct			1
