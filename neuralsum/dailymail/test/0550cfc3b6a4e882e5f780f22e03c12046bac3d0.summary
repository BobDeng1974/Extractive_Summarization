@entity0 by @entity1 , has acquired a morbid flavour since @entity11 flight 9525 was deliberately crashed into the @entity12 by its troubled co-pilot @entity13			1
the tragedy ignited an ongoing debate about stress and depression among pilots , and airline vetting procedures , in which just about all of us have a vested interest			1
this makes @entity1 ’s book , unwittingly , very timely indeed			1
when he was writing it he had never heard of @entity13 , of course , but nor does he dwell on the horrors of 9/11 or any other plane crashes either accidental or premeditated			2
@entity1 is a senior first officer with @entity27 , who wants us simply to understand his passion for his job , and to share with us many of its more beguiling secrets			1
like me , he was still a child when he was first invited into an aeroplane cockpit , and like me , he regarded it as one of the transcendent treats of his young life			2
but for him , the mystique endured			2
it is reassuring , now more than ever , to be reminded that even for experienced pilots air travel can still be an exhilarating , almost magical experience			2
@entity1 is a senior first officer with @entity27 and he wants the reader to simply understand his passion for his job @entity1 , an @entity48 , worked as a management consultant before rekindling that childhood obsession			1
he learned to fly in @entity51 , tempted by our ‘ historic relationship with aviation ’			2
coincidentally , his first job was to pilot the @entity56 320 on medium - distance @entity58 flights — exactly what @entity13 was doing on that catastrophically fateful day			2
but @entity1 moved on to @entity60 747s , and they are his great love			1
he admires the 747 like a sculptor might a perfect human torso , observing how pleasing they are to the eye			0
@entity1 recalls a wildlife writer once describing @entity69 ’s great blue heron as ‘ the 747 of the swamp ’ and notes how this would delight the aircraft ’s chief designer , @entity72 , who was greatly influenced by the anatomy of birds			1
but @entity72 ( now in his mid- 90s ) once stated that the 747 is more ‘ a place ’ than a conveyance			0
pilots like flying 747s for all kinds of reasons , @entity1 tells us , but not the least of them is one of the most prosaic : unlike the @entity56 , in which pilots usually wear heavy socks , they have foot heaters			1
and the ‘ frozen surface of the @entity89 looks better — everything looks better — when your feet are warm ’			0
he writes elegantly about his pilot ’s eye view of the world and explains that he has come to measure countries in jet time , ie how long they take to cross			0
thus , @entity99 is a seven - hour country and @entity100 , with a tailwind , is merely a 15 - minute country			0
noting the vast , desolate regions he routinely flies over , it does not surprise him that , according to one calculation , the portion of the @entity107 ’s surface on which an unclothed human could survive for 24 hours is just 15 per cent			0
but of even more interest , certainly to those of us who occasionally fly long - haul , are the nuts and bolts of those journeys			0
@entity1 will get to the airport 90 minutes before he pilots his 747 to @entity119 or @entity120 , and there will meet the rest of the crew , 20 or so strong			1
and ‘ meet ’ really means ‘ meet ’ : air crews do not move as a pack , and are usually strangers to each other			0
as he puts it , ‘ our nametags are not worn only for passengers ... there is a reasonable chance we may never speak to each other again in our lives			0
’ before boarding , he will brief the cabin crew on what kind of flight time and weather to expect , while they will tell him if there ’s anything noteworthy about the passenger roster , and whether any of the @entity27 staff on board have friends or family on the flight , people known , splendidly , as ‘ @entity151 ’			1
unsurprisingly , life on a 747 is full of jargon : a second co-pilot on longer flights is known as ‘ the heavy ’ , one acting as ‘ heavy out ’ , the other as ‘ heavy home ’			0
and for a pilot , the sky is full of aerial milestones called waypoints , with names usually comprising five capital letters			0
these often relate directly to the place below , so above @entity168 in @entity1 ’s home state , there is the waypoint @entity172 , referring to the region ’s prized shellfish , and another , @entity175 , after one of the city ’s more notable sons , the late actor @entity175 , who played mr @entity179 in @entity180			1
but other names are harder to explain			0
above @entity182 , @entity183 , are the waypoints @entity184 and @entity186			0
@entity1 ’s best guess is that an air - traffic controller there was a fan of @entity191 ’ singer @entity192			1
who would have thought that the mysteries of flying would embrace mr @entity179 , @entity151 and @entity192 ? @entity196 is crammed with these revelations and more , while the acknowledgments end on a plaintive note			0
maybe one day , @entity1 hopes , wide - eyed children will again be allowed in the cockpit during a flight			1
in the meantime , he does a very good job of telling us what happens in there , and why we should still trust the men at the controls .			2
