a celebrated @entity1 female fighter who bravely commanded an all - female resistance force against @entity3 in the besieged city of @entity5 is believed to have been killed by the militant group			1
@entity7 , also known as @entity8 , was a prominent figure within the @entity10 - the woman - only offshoot of the @entity13 that has proved so effective in defending @entity5 since the city was first attacked by @entity16 terrorists last september			1
last month the @entity1 troops were able to push the final @entity3 militants out of @entity5 , but official ypg / @entity10 sources have now said that @entity7 was among four fighters tragically killed in the process			1
at numerous points in the four month siege it appeared the city was close to falling , with @entity1 troops trapped in the centre and surrounded on all sides by the militants , who raped and massacred their way through the suburbs towards the end of last year			2
the arrival of @entity1 peshmerga support squadrons from neighbouring @entity50 boosted the fightback , however , and by early january the @entity13 / @entity10 had pinned @entity3 back into small pockets of the city			1
the fearlessness of the @entity1 fighters in the face of @entity3 ' uncompromising brutality was such that some militants are said to have defied their commanders ' orders to continue the fight in @entity5 as it had been little more than death trap for them			2
hero : @entity7 is believed to have been killed in the final push to rid @entity5 of @entity3 militants however it was in the final push to completely clear @entity5 of terrorists that @entity7 , a young male fighter named @entity30 , and two as yet unidentified others are understood to have been killed			1
@entity10 is short for @entity70 , which means @entity71 in @entity1			2
the group was established in 2012 as a branch of the @entity13 ( @entity74 ) and is believed to have anything between 7,000 and 10,000 members - mostly in @entity77 and @entity50			1
the majority of these female fighters have spent the past six months battling @entity3 and have had great success in pinning the terror group back and liberating towns and cities under the militants ' control			2
the fact the @entity10 is an all - female group has had another unexpected benefit as @entity3 militants are said to believe that if they are killed by a woman , they will not be rewarded with 72 virgins in the afterlife			1
' these [ @entity3 ] soldiers apparently believed that if they were killed in battle , they went to paradise as long as they were killed by a man , ' @entity92 , who chairs the @entity94 @entity93 , told the @entity98 last september			1
' and these female soldiers were communicating their satisfaction with the fact that they had taken the fight to @entity3 and had stopped the advance , turned back the advance - slayed a number of these fighters , who would then run away , ' he added			0
as a result @entity3 militants have been reluctant to enter battles with the @entity10 , reportedly leading to descent within the ranks of the terrorists and hastening their retreat from battles in places like @entity5			2
well - known : @entity7 appeared in numerous motivational videos and photographs used by the @entity13 / @entity10 to inspire their fighters to continue defending @entity5 from the @entity3 terrorists attempting to seize control happy : @entity1 @entity13 fighters are seen dancing in celebration last month after the last @entity3 fighters were finally pushed out of @entity5 following a four month siege			1
sadly @entity122 was killed in the battle the destroyed eastern part of the @entity77 town of @entity5 is pictured after the final battle to clear it of @entity3 destruction : a car is seen covered in rubble in the centre of the now liberated @entity77 city of @entity5 @entity1 are celebrating after flushing @entity16 militants out of the town of @entity5 , but victory is not yet certain in their campaign to cement hard - won autonomy in northern @entity77			1
hundreds of @entity94 - led coalition air strikes have devastated the town , which is adrift in an @entity16 - controlled sea			0
objections to autonomy from neighbouring @entity142 and the @entity94 could also make it hard for them to sustain their gains			0
the retaking by last week of the predominantly @entity1 town after a four - month siege by @entity16 was a major defeat for the @entity150 fundamentalist group that controls a 20,000 - square mile arc of @entity77 and @entity50			1
for the @entity1 , it is a bittersweet victory , as some 200,000 people , almost the entire population of @entity156 province , are still sheltering in @entity142			0
dozens of men waiting at the @entity142 crossing to return to @entity156 province late last week shouted and danced for joy , unframed by the wrecked city of @entity5 looming behind them			0
most of @entity5 is destroyed , with unexplored shells and twisted hunks of cars strewn along the streets			0
members of the all - female @entity10 force prepare to go out on patrol to ensure @entity3 militants are not in the city carnage : the centre of @entity5 is in total ruins following clashes with @entity3 and coalition air strikes @entity1 are starting to return to @entity5 after the city was cleared of @entity3 militants following a four month siege liberated : a @entity1 @entity13 fighter walks with his child in the center of the @entity77 border town of @entity5 the battle for @entity5 weakened @entity16 , its best fighters perishing and much of its heavy weaponry depleted , @entity189 , the top official in the town told @entity192 at @entity193 , where a statue of an eagle is surrounded by flattened tower blocks and cratered streets			1
' they will attack again ... the coalition has supported us with weapons and air strikes			0
we are hopeful they will continue so we can eradicate @entity3 , ' @entity189 said , adding that @entity50 @entity1 peshmerga and a few @entity204 brigades remain in @entity5			0
the @entity204 cooperation marks a turnaround after earlier clashes between them and the @entity1			0
last month , @entity77 government forces also battled @entity1 , breaking a tacit agreement between the two sides to focus on other enemies in the war			0
the @entity1 , who espouse socialism and promote gender equality , first captured @entity156 province in 2012 after @entity218 's forces withdrew , dubbing it the @entity220 , or western , @entity221			0
two other non-contiguous @entity1 - dominated regions of @entity77 , @entity223 and @entity224 , are also under their control			2
@entity1 say it is home to about 4 million people			0
the @entity77 civil war , which began as a popular uprising against president @entity218 in march 2011 , has killed 200,000 people and turned 3 million more into refugees .			0

@entity7 bravely led an all - female @entity10 brigade defending @entity77 city
her group helped force @entity3 terrorists out of the city in late january
but she and three others are believed to have been killed in the final battle
@entity7 was well known for interviews talking about the @entity1 resistance
she also appeared in motivational *posters* and videos produced by @entity10
