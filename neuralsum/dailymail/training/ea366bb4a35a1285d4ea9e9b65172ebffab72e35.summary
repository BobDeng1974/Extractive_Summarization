by @entity0 recreating life on @entity2 for two weeks in a @entity4 desert seems like child ’s play compared to this project			1
intrepid volunteers are currently getting prepared to live in @entity8 , one of the most hostile and remotest places on @entity11			2
the @entity13 team will be simulating life on @entity2 in the barren continent for nine months at an altitude of 3200 metres			1
a place of extremes , temperatures can drop to ¿ 80 ° c in the winter , with a yearly average temperature of ¿ 50 ° c @entity18 is a joint @entity28 - @entity27 inland @entity8 research station run by the @entity29 and @entity30			1
every year it hosts a human research protocol coordinated by @entity32			0
as @entity18 lies at the very southern tip of @entity11 , the sun does not rise above the horizon in the winter and does not set in the summer			1
the altitude and location mean that the air in @entity18 is very thin and holds less oxygen			1
venturing outside the base requires wearing layers of clothes and limits the time spent outdoors			0
in addition , @entity18 sits in the largest desert in the world			1
the air is extremely dry , so the crew suffer from continuously chapped lips and irritated eyes			1
no animals can survive in this region – even bacteria find it hard coping with the extreme temperatures			2
this means they ’ll be living with a third less oxygen than is available at sea level			2
during the @entity8 winter , the crew will endure four months of complete darkness : the sun disappears from the beginning of may , and is not seen again until late august			2
living in isolation with a @entity68 crew of 13 and in the world 's most extreme environment creates an ideal opportunity to conduct research into the adaptation of human psychology and physiology			1
for the past summer months over 60 scientists and technicians have been working on research that can only be performed in the extremely cold , desolate desert of @entity8			0
wrapping up their work , aircraft are now ferrying equipment and people back to the coast where the weather is more agreeable			0
once the sun sets below the horizon for four months in may , the region will really start to get cold			0
with temperatures reaching – 80 ° c , fuel freezes and aircraft can not land			0
even bulldozers and other vehicles are stored unused in an underground shelter until the next summer			0
the altitude and location mean that the air in @entity18 is very thin and holds less oxygen			1
venturing outside the base requires wearing layers of clothes and limits the time spent outdoors as @entity18 lies at the very southern tip of @entity11 , the @entity104 does not rise above the horizon in the winter and does not set in the summer			1
the crew must live without sunlight for four months of the year the core crew , the tenth team to spend winter at @entity18 , will have to rely on their supplies for survival and their own legs to get around			1
leaving the base to check on equipment or take snow samples is a hard enough undertaking in itself as multiple layers of clothing are required to keep warm and walking is strenuous owing to the lack of oxygen			2
left to their own devices , the @entity18 ‘ @entity131 crew ’ have a few months to prepare for the onset of winter , cleaning the base and settling in to their habitat			1
wrapping up their work , aircraft are ferrying equipment and people back to the coast where the weather is more agreeable in the great open landscape covered in darkness , colours , smells and sounds are almost non-existent , adding to the sense of loneliness medical doctor @entity145 will be watching the crew and himself closely as their bodies and minds cope with the extreme isolation and environment			1
as a stand - in for a human outpost on another planet , @entity32 is researching crew behaviour and physiology in stressful environments			2
unlike simulated isolation studies in other space analogues , the @entity18 crew know that no one can help them for nine months – there is no quick exit back to civilisation			1
in the open landscape , colours , smells and sounds are almost non-existent , adding to the sense of loneliness in a separate project to find out how humans would cope on @entity2 , an experiment organised by the @entity173 has attempted to recreate the daily routine of astronauts here on @entity11			1
for two weeks in january , a group of intrepid space enthusiasts donned space suits and lived in isolation , surviving on rations and showering around once every three days			2
among them was @entity182 , a @entity183 student , who heard about volunteers for the project through a fellow student			0
speaking to @entity186 , she describes the unusual experiment as enlightening and at times overwhelming			0
‘ when i was in a spacesuit i felt like i was in an outside world , ’ said ms @entity182			0
‘ it makes you think and behave differently			0
’ ‘ there was n’t much personal space , ’ she said			0
‘ there were a couple of disagreements			0
only little things , like noise in the kitchen when you have to work out what to do			0
we quickly found out that we need to talk about these things at the beginning			0
’ if an argument did occur , crew members could n’t just step outside to cool off			2
leaving the @entity207 required a request to @entity209 a day in advance .			0

in just one week , the crew of @entity18 will be left to their own devices
they plan to conduct experiments in conditions similar to that of @entity2
the altitude and location mean that air is very thin and holds less oxygen
medical doctor @entity145 will be watching the crew and himself as their bodies and minds cope with the extreme isolation
