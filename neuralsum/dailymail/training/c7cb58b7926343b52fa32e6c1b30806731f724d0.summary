a pensioner has lost a bitter legal battle with a multi-millionaire @entity3 peer over a patch of land next to his recycling yard that he has used for more than 17 years			1
@entity7 , 68 , said he decided to clear the disused plot , which was used as a dumping ground , after he was unable to find the legal owner in government records			1
but lawyers insisted the land in @entity14 , @entity15 , belonged to the estate of @entity17 , son of ex-prime minister @entity18 , and took legal action against mr @entity7			1
@entity7 , right , said he decided to clear the disused plot , which was used as a dumping ground , after he was unable to find the legal owner in government records			1
lawyers said it belonged to @entity24 ( left ) mr @entity7 , who runs a pallet recycling firm , said he spent around £ 10,000 clearing the 0.3 acre site and had been using it to park his trailers and to hand out free firewood to the local community			1
lawyers acting for @entity32 , former chairman of private bank @entity33 , said the land was part of the @entity36 , and an adjoining estate owned by the @entity39 family			1
mr @entity7 was ordered to vacate the site in @entity14 , @entity15 , but appealed all the way to the @entity42 where judges have now found in @entity24 's favour			1
today , mr @entity7 told of his disappointment at the outcome and said he was bracing himself to be thrown off the land			1
he said : ' i ca n't believe i was dragged to court over this in the first place but when the decision went against us we decided to take it all the way			2
' this will mean that i will be thrown off the land and it will cost me a fortune			2
mr @entity7 , who runs a pallet recycling firm , pictured above , said he spent around £ 10,000 clearing the 0.3 acre site and had been using it to park his trailers and to hand out free firewood to the local community in a written judgement , @entity64 found that the two estates had a valid title to the land near mr @entity7 's business ( above ) as he could not produce definitive evidence that it was owned by another party ' i have been portrayed as a squatter but i have looked after the land for 17 years when nobody else was bothering with it			1
' it 's a piece of land which is of no use to the estate but they have been determined to remove me from it			1
i 'm really disappointed , i think it 's ridiculous			2
' he added : ' we have been here for 17 years and have spent a lot of time and money clearing the site which was previously a dumping ground			0
' we checked with the registers of @entity91 and could n't find a clean title for the land so we decided to clear it ourselves			2
' we use the site to park trailers and to dispense fire wood for free to the local community , which is much appreciated in an area of high unemployment			0
' in a written judgement , @entity64 found that the two estates had a valid title to the land as mr @entity7 could not produce definitive evidence that it was owned by another party			1
@entity32 had earlier sparked fury by brokering a deal to let @entity109 mine his land in @entity15 for a fee			1
in 2012 environmental protesters invaded the ground of his mansion on the estate and dug up his lawn			0
yesterday , no one from @entity118 and @entity119 , lord home 's family business that manages the estate , was available for comment			2
the estate 's factor @entity127 has previously said that they believe they are the legal owners of the land along with the @entity39 estate and had offered in the past to lease it to mr @entity7			1
legacy : lord home is the son of former @entity3 prime minister sir @entity18 , pictured above the @entity118 family 's connections can be traced back to 767 ad when @entity139 ' turned ' a battle in favour of @entity142			1
but it is @entity118 , born in 1174 , who is widely acknowledged as the founder of the @entity146 family and the @entity147			0
the @entity148 can boast similar lineage to the @entity150			0
the family are associated with the @entity152 , which was purchased from sir @entity153 in 1611 by the first @entity148			0
the two families and the two estates came together in 1832 when @entity156 married @entity157 – the 11th @entity148			0
the union resulted in the joining of the @entity119 – geographically separate , but run as a single integrated trading business			2
the set - up is one that remains today			2
the estates are focused on the @entity163 at @entity164 and @entity118 in @entity15 , extending to about 36,000 acres			0
the @entity165 in @entity15 has been the seat of the @entity118 family for some 800 years			0
but the fortunes of the estate ebbed and flowed with each generation			0
@entity171 , which once stood on the estate , was sieged , destroyed , burnt down before it was finally demolished in 1938 – leaving behind it only the remains of @entity174 ( built in 1457 )			0
in 1689 @entity175 , @entity176 , raised the @entity177 - later to be known as the @entity178 - at @entity179 in @entity118			0
the @entity177 served both their country for 300 years before being disbanded at @entity118 in 1968			0
