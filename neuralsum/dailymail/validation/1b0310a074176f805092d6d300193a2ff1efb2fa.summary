as we approached another huge rapid , i had to pinch myself for a second			0
white - water rafting had been on my bucket list for years but to do it with @entity6 in the middle of the @entity8 is a moment i will never forget			1
hurtling along the @entity10 in between steep mud cliffs with the loud buzzing noise of the jungle i felt like i was starring in my own version of @entity15			0
‘ you can just imagine a teraductile flying overhead , ’ @entity6 quipped			1
‘ the light , the scenery , the air , the people , it ’s really unlike anywhere else in the world ’			2
trip of a lifetime : i was lucky to join adventurer @entity6 on a tour of @entity28 @entity30 briefing : @entity6 watches on as our white - water rafting guide @entity31 gives us the lowdown setting sail on our @entity8 adventure : @entity6 and i , on the right of the boat , receive instructions from our guide i was invited to accompany 40 - year - old @entity6 on a trip to the country where his life of adventure and travel all started			1
@entity28 has long - been associated as a gateway to the much more popular @entity46 or simply a pit stop on a tour of @entity49			1
but from the bustling city of @entity52 to the stunning @entity53 , the @entity8 jungle and the sublime beaches , it 's much more than that			2
@entity6 ’s first trip as an 19 - year - old , unable to speak a word of @entity59 , saw him spend a sobering night in a @entity52 prison cell and endure 15 rabies injections in his stomach after getting bitten by a dog			1
however the incidents did little to phase @entity6 as he says it was that trip that he decided he wanted to make a career out of travel			1
‘ i never believed i would do it , ’ says @entity6 , husband to @entity68 and father to @entity70 and @entity71			1
taking a breather : i prepare for the next stage of our descent down @entity79 volcano the food : ' guinea pig intrigues me			0
i 'm still trying to master it			0
i ’m an animal lover so actually one of the hard things i always have is embracing local food			0
' the people : ' in the @entity49 countries the people are very friendly			2
the weather : ' we went from the @entity8 where it was very hot to the chilly @entity53			0
the light and sky is incredible in @entity52			0
' favourite moment : ' i 've done white - water rafting a few times but this time was really amazing			2
' weirdest moment : ' getting whipped by nettles in the middle of a market near people eating their chicken and rice was a strange but memorable experience			2
' scariest moment : ' when i first came to @entity107 i was arrested and put in a cell for a night for not having my passport on me			2
i was also bitten by a dog and had to have loads of painful rabies injections in my stomach ! ' the changes : ' @entity28 has changed unimaginably since i first came here			1
the infrastructure has vastly improved and it ’s so much more geared to tourists			0
' ‘ it ’s gone in a strange convoluted way			0
it ’s hard being away from home but i love my job			0
i love meeting people and exploring and experiencing new places			2
’ it was a place on @entity127 reality show @entity125 in 2000 that propelled @entity6 into the spotlight			1
since then he 's raced 160 miles across the @entity131 desert , rowed across the @entity132 with olympian @entity133 and presented numerous programmes including @entity135 , @entity136 and @entity137			2
for the last 18 months he 's also become a @entity138 and using his vast experience he helped curate the itinerary for this trip			1
he 's packed a lot into his 40 - years but tearing down @entity79 on a mountain bike was a first for us both			1
he climbed the mountain as a teenager but this time took a more exhilarating route down			2
he said : ‘ everyone assumes i love everything but if you look at the history of all the adventure things i ’ve done like they are usually slow			2
it was a bit scary but that ’s what makes it so fun			0
’ next up was a spot of horse - riding at the historic @entity162 , which is built on the site of an @entity164			0
the current owner , glamorous @entity166 , inherited the property from her grandfather , @entity168 , two - time president of @entity28			1
food for thought : cow hooves and roasted guinea pig are popular local dishes in @entity28 llama selfie : i grabbed one of the friendly animals for a quick photograph @entity179 roamed around the hotel ’s beautiful cobbled courtyard so i grabbed one for a selfie			1
adventure sports aside we also took in the culture of the magical country			2
the voyage started in @entity52 , the highest capital city in the world , perched at 3000m on the eastern slopes of @entity190 , an active volcano			0
the @entity192 , situated in the old town overlooking the @entity194 , was a great place to recharge our batteries and adjust to the altitude			0
joining local travel film @entity199 we enjoyed a walking tour of the historic centre , a @entity202 , which features 40 colonial churches and chapels , including the stunning @entity205 which is decorated in gold			2
160 years in the making : the stunning @entity205 church was painted in gold leaf by hand bizarre medical practice : @entity6 gets his torso whipped by @entity213 in @entity194 market i also witnessed bizarre scenes at the nearby @entity194 market where local healers whip willing punters with stinging nettles to raise energy levels			1
@entity6 took the plunge , stripping down to his underpants in between displays of meats from cow hooves to llama and paying $ 10 for the privilege			1
afterwards angry red welts covered his body			0
he said : ‘ it was a very strange but memorable experience			0
she said a had bad energy and a lethargy and a problem with my breathing which could be the altitude or from my recent bout of pneumonia			0
' maybe it was the relief of escaping the nettles , but i had a spring in my step and felt revitalised as i left the market			0
’ flying the flag : @entity28 's national colours are seen above the @entity245 in @entity52 's @entity246 perfectly maintained : the beautiful @entity246 in @entity52 is a place for locals and tourists to relax we also dropped in more unique local businesses including the famous sweet shop @entity253 where we tried our hand at sugar - coating peanuts in a wooden bowl over a hot fire			1
@entity259 ’s @entity258 is a bizarre business which restores baby @entity262 dolls while also doubling up as a facility to treat people with skin conditions			1
@entity262 dolls are traditionally kept in the lounge of all of the @entity269 households in @entity28			1
typically they are dressed in the occupation of the family members with a @entity262 doctor , a construction worker and even a soldier with a gun among those we saw on sale			0
we also took part in a culinary masterclass at chocolatier @entity282 located in the @entity284 art district			0
strange tradition : @entity262 dolls are sold wearing the traditional dress of various occupations the area is home to lots of local artists and a place for children to play with games including hula hooping lining the main cobbled colonial street			0
after spending time in @entity52 we visited @entity298 ’s local market where thousands of indigenous people , dressed in traditional ponchos and hats and accompanied by pigs and llamas on leads , descend every thursday			1
one of the busiest corners of the market was a café selling guinea pig			0
previously faced with tarantula and rattle - snake , animal lover @entity6 admits this typical @entity53 cuisine still mystifies him			1
ice cream break : @entity313 in @entity284 specialises in unusual flavours such as white corn ‘ guinea pig intrigues me ’ , he said			0
‘ i do n’t think it ’s the tastiest of meats but the locals genuinely love the taste			0
it ’s not something i ’ve mastered yet			0
’ @entity326 ( potato soup ) , @entity328 and a meat selection dinner , served on a hot volcanic rock which you then use to bbq the food yourself , are other popular dishes we experienced on our journey , mixed down with a @entity336 , a traditional @entity28 drink of warm spiced cinnamon mixed with tequila			1
cow foetus is also a delicacy in @entity28 but we steered clear of that			1
each mealtime we quizzed @entity6 on his adventures and can report he is much more fun that i had imagined , even trying to help one young man in our party score a date on @entity351			1
local life : locals in traditional ponchos and hats descend every thursday to @entity298 market @entity358 's nose train : the route , which costs £ 15 per person , offers beautiful views of the @entity53 our tour also included an 800 - metre descent on the @entity358 's nose train , which zig zags down the spectacular mountainside on the route between @entity52 and @entity367 and a trip to the lush hot springs in @entity370 heated from nearby @entity371			1
getting lost in the @entity8 was an added bonus that was not on the itinerary			0
due to a mix up with collection points after our rafting experience , myself , the @entity374 and two fellow journalists found ourselves stranded along the edge of the @entity10			1
impressive : huge bridge which crosses the @entity10 had a @entity15 vibe out of this world : @entity6 and i check out the @entity10 before we go white - water rafting @entity8 life : @entity388 , our lovely @entity389 , and i meet the locals @entity52 @entity192 @entity391 @entity392 @entity393 @entity394 @entity395 @entity370 activities arranged by @entity397 the 11 - day @entity53 to the @entity8 tour with @entity374 is available from £ 3645pp			1
for more details visit @entity374 with no shoes , phone , water or sun cream , we used our broken @entity59 to mingle with locals and have a beer			1
when our mortified tour guide turned up three hours later we were almost disappointed			0
@entity6 , who had earlier dashed off to eat whittchety grubs at a local @entity8 community during the incident ( as you do ) , told us such moments are what adventuring is all about			1
he said : ‘ i am an optimist so i always see the positives in everything			0
you got to experience a little bit of local life in the @entity8 which is amazing			2
‘ an adventure is all about taking yourself out of your normal routine and experiencing something new			2
’ i could n't agree more .			0

@entity6 's life of adventure and travel began on a trip to @entity28 21 years *ago*
his first visit saw him arrested by the *police* and bitten by a dog
but says stripping to his underpants for bizarre medical practice this time was one of his strangest experiences ever
@entity6 has teamed up with @entity374 to *inspire* people to go on their own adventures
