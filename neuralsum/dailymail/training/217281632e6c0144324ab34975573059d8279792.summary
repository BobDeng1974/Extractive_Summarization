lawmakers in @entity1 and @entity2 want their states to join @entity4 and require high school seniors to pass a written civics test before they can graduate			1
the questions would be drawn from the same test legal immigrants must take before they can become @entity11 citizens			1
some of the material is comparatively easy for anyone who 's seen @entity14 – ' what is the name of the @entity16 ? ' – while others could be tricky for 18 - year - olds who get their news from @entity20			1
for instance : ' in what year was the @entity21 written ? ' @entity23 : it 's not 1776			1
scroll down to take the test @entity27 mission : @entity1 state representative @entity28 wants high school seniors to put off graduation until they can score a 60 on a basic civics test @entity32 : state representative @entity33 wants the bill made law in @entity2 , but he does n't know when @entity36 started history : this man wrote the @entity39			1
can you name him ? @entity1 state rep. @entity28 and @entity2 state rep. @entity33 , both @entity41 , have legislation in the works to tell boards of education statewide to insert the tests of basic @entity11 facts into school curricula			1
flunk it , and high school students will have to study and try again			2
a 60 per cent score is required for a passing grade – the same target used by @entity54			1
' we require immigrants to have a basic understanding and appreciation for @entity11 civics , ' @entity28 said in a statement on friday , first reported by @entity61			1
' why should the threshold be any different for citizens who are lucky enough to be born in the @entity11 ? ' perhaps surprisingly , the @entity64 opposes the idea , saying students already have enough standardized tests to study for as they exit high school			2
' we also have a long - standing position that high school content standards need to be focused on career and college readiness , ' said the group 's assistant director for government relations , @entity73			2

@entity33 has already introduced his bill in @entity2			1
' when you start having students graduate from high school who do n’t know where we got our independence from and that kind of stuff , i think it ’s a little frightening , ' he told the @entity107			0
he said he has n't taken the test himself , but ' i think i would do pretty well			1
' ' i know the @entity39 was signed in 1776			0
i know @entity36 was started dec. 7 , 1941			1
i know what the @entity109 was fought over			0
' actually , @entity36 started in september 1939 , and regional skirmishes that led to it began even earlier			1
the @entity113 bombed @entity114 on december 7 , 1941 , but the @entity11 did n't enter the conflict until the following day			2
new legislation : on thursday , @entity4 governor , @entity117 ( pictured , left , on friday ) signed new legislation requiring all high school students in the state to pass the @entity11 citizenship test on civics before they can graduate @entity4 already has a similar law , signed on january 15 by gov. @entity117			1
it 's a project of the @entity4 - based @entity124 , which is circulating model legislation in all 50 states			1
the group wants the idea adopted nationwide by 2017 , and says as many as 15 state legislatures could float proposals this year alone			1
