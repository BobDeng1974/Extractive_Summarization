by @entity0 published : 19:30 est , 12 april 2013 updated : 04:36 est , 13 april 2013 the @entity2 has tried so many drugs - including cannabis , magic mushrooms and @entity6 - that she says when it comes to her research , ' i have always considered myself my own best laboratory ' she has been known to wander around her home in floaty clothes with a tropical bird — possibly a parakeet — sitting on her shoulder			1
perhaps such eccentricity is not surprising since the @entity2 is best known for her belief in the health benefits of magic mushrooms and trepanning ( drilling a hole in one ’s head to ‘ expand the consciousness ’ )			1
preferring to call herself plain @entity28 , she lives in @entity29 , a hunting lodge built in the time of @entity32 which was used as a backdrop in a @entity35 film			1
it is her @entity38 hereditary seat , from which she runs the @entity39 , an outfit she set up in 1998 to campaign for the legalisation of drugs and to help research their potential beneficial effects for medicine			1
she has tried so many drugs — including cannabis , magic mushrooms and @entity6 — that she says when it comes to her research , ‘ i have always considered myself my own best laboratory ’			1
yet one visitor warns that her ‘ research ’ has taken its toll , saying : ‘ though articulate , she is not a particularly good advert for drug use because she looks so fragile and shakes a lot			1
’ @entity29 has nevertheless become a second home to a number of high - profile scientists who are on the committee of @entity28 ’s foundation			1
the most prominent is professor @entity61 , who was sacked as the government ’s chief drug tsar in 2009 when he claimed that @entity64 was less dangerous than horse riding			1
today , together with the countess , he runs joint - research programmes between @entity68 and the @entity39			1
last week , it emerged that , as president of the @entity71 , @entity61 has been given £ 550,000 of public money by the @entity73 for a project backed by the @entity39 to investigate whether the hallucinogenic compound in magic mushrooms — psilocybin — might be used to treat depression			1
the only obstacle standing in the way of the trial , says @entity61 , is that he ’s having trouble getting hold of the restricted compound			1
but with the uniquely determined @entity86 — predictably nicknamed @entity87 — behind him , this will surely be overcome			1
this year , the countess of @entity86 turned 70			1
but neither age nor her husband the @entity93 ’s vast inheritance has dimmed the zeal of this queen of @entity96 on the question of drugs			1
despite her husband ’s fortune — not to mention his @entity103 stately in @entity104 , the 44,000 acres in @entity105 and the £ 100 million art collection — @entity28 has sought independent funding for her research and claims to have little money to throw at the foundation herself			1
among those on the countess 's committee which campaigns for the legalisation of drugs is professor @entity61 ( above )			1
he was sacked as the government 's chief drug tsar in 2009 when he claimed that @entity64 was less dangerous than horse riding but there is no question about her husband ’s devotion to her and her eccentricities			1
indeed , shortly after their marriage , he allowed himself to undergo a procedure she espoused known as ‘ trepanning ’			2
but more of that later			2
@entity86 ’s extreme interest in exploring the mind seems to have started in childhood			1
eccentricity seems to run in the family			2
@entity28 ’s grandmother @entity137 , a part - @entity139 , part - @entity138 artist who was brought up in @entity140 wore clothes made of hessian and a bowler hat — which was on her head when she died			1
the next generation was no less strange			2
@entity28 ’s father , an art and antiques - loving country squire called @entity149 , married his own cousin , @entity150			2
together , they inherited @entity29 from his parents			1
and into this rose pink home in january 1943 , @entity28 was born			2
her godfather was @entity156 , her father ’s best friend at @entity158 , who became a celebrated @entity160 monk in @entity161			2
although she was raised a @entity162 , @entity28 became interested in spiritualism under his unorthodox influence			0
last week , it emerged that , as president of the @entity71 , @entity61 has been given £ 550,000 of public money by the @entity73 for a project backed by the @entity39 to investigate whether the hallucinogenic compound in magic mushrooms - psilocybin - might be used to treat depression in 1966 , after dropping out of both her convent school and @entity158 , where she had studied comparative religion , she fell for a handsome @entity176 scientist called @entity177 — who had been refused his medical degree after openly advocating the use of cannabis			1
it was @entity182 who introduced her to trepanning , a procedure that has been practised since the @entity184			0
@entity177 was obsessed by a crackpot theory dubbed ‘ @entity186 ’			0
this held that ever since man stood on two legs , he had not been getting enough blood to his brain			0
what modern man needed was a hole in the head to improve blood flow			0
@entity177 called this hole ‘ a third eye ’ and claimed it to be the oldest form of surgery			0
in 1965 , he drilled a hole into his own skull — and within a few weeks he was in a @entity176 lunatic asylum			0
@entity177 had a friend — @entity205 and @entity158 graduate , @entity206 — who also swore by trepanning , and he became @entity28 ’s next lover , as well as father of her two sons @entity211 and @entity212			0
before long , the couple were performing their own trepanning experiments			0
@entity206 decided to start on his own skull first , with @entity28 assisting him			0
perhaps inevitably , the experiment went wrong and she had to take him to hospital			0
undaunted , he made another attempt after he had recovered , and pronounced it so successful that he wrote a book about it — @entity223			0
his testimony convinced @entity28 that she must do it to herself			0
the countess married @entity227 ( above ) , six years her junior and heir to the earldom of @entity86 and march			1
they wed in @entity232 , at sunset , in the shade of the @entity236 pyramid it was on a sunday afternoon in december 1970 that the 27 - year - old art student sat in front a mirror in her @entity240 flat , shaved her hairline , put on a floral shower cup to keep the rest of her hair back — and injected herself with local anaesthetic			2
she then peeled back a patch of skin with a scalpel , held a dentist ’s drill to the bone above her forehead and pushed its teeth into her skull			0
she continued drilling until she had got through the bone , and stopped when she reached the ‘ dura mater ’ — the thin membrane between the bone and the brain itself			0
at this point , a geyser of blood shot out of the opening			0
then she bandaged her head and mopped up the blood and went to a party in the evening			0
she even set up a camera for a movie of the operation , a clip of which can now be seen on the internet			2
it is not for the faint of heart			0
in the following years she twice stood for @entity276 in @entity240 , on a ticket campaigning for trepanning to be available on the @entity278			0
second time round , 139 people actually voted for her			0
she and @entity206 were together for 28 years , but split up in the early nineties			0
before long , however , she had met and married @entity227 , six years her junior and heir to the earldom of @entity86 and march			1
they wed in @entity232 , at sunset , in the shade of the @entity236 pyramid			0
he too was seduced by his wife ’s obsession with trepanning			0
in @entity291 , he found a surgeon who drilled a hole in his head for $ 2,000 , which he found ‘ highly beneficial ’			0
@entity93 , an @entity158 don who once taught @entity295 , was known for hosting amazing parties at @entity297 , his @entity103 stately home in @entity104 , which made boho - aristo groupies like @entity300 go weak at the knees			2
there were plenty with his first wife @entity304 and he continued the pattern with his new countess			2
the most memorable of these parties took place last year when @entity227 ’s bombshell daughter @entity308 , married a pop musician called @entity310			0
the event , described as ‘ the maddest wedding of the year ’ , was attended by @entity313 and her daughter @entity314 , and the supermodel @entity316 sisters			0
the bride wore a very revealing dress ; the ring bearer was a dog			0
yet despite this decadence , since setting up her foundation she has travelled the world enlisting the support of presidents , made depositions to the @entity327 , and collected big - name scientists around her			1
even proof that this theory was bunkum has n’t put @entity28 or her circle off — hence the £ 550,000 grant to investigate magic mushrooms			1
it is clear , too , that her interest in drugs has been handed down the generations			2
in 2011 , @entity28 ’s younger son @entity212 , 28 , made a film , @entity340 , which was financed by @entity342 , son of @entity343 , and argues that criminalisation of drugs is n’t working			2
nor was the family ’s fervent belief in the legalisation of drugs dented by a tragic reminder of the dangers of drugs that came in 2004			1
@entity353 , who @entity304 had married after her divorce from @entity355 , died at the age of 48 , with a cocktail of alcohol , heroin and cocaine in his blood			0
nothing , not even tragedy , could put off the @entity2 from espousing the benefits of illegal substances and mind - bending mushrooms .			1

countess of @entity86 and march - aka ' @entity87 ' - is best known for her belief in the health benefits of magic mushrooms
she set up @entity29 foundation in 1998 to campaign for legalisation of drugs
on committee is prof @entity61 , who was sacked as @entity382 's drug tsar in 2009 for claiming @entity64 was less dangerous than horse riding
@entity61 has been given £ 550,000 of public money for a project backed by her foundation to see if magic mushroom compound might help treat depression
