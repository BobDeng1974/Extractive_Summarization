by @entity1 reporter published : 00:54 est , 23 september 2013 updated : 06:48 est , 24 september 2013 with his fame and influence @entity2 has few doors barred to him			1
but when it comes to his son @entity10 , the film star 's @entity7 credentials mean nothing			1
@entity2 , winner of the trophy for best actor in a miniseries or movie for playing @entity16 in @entity17 's @entity18 , closed his speech with a reference to his 34 - year - old son , @entity10 , who is serving a lengthy prison term for various drug crimes			1
@entity2 said he hoped ' they allow me to see him soon '			1
backstage , the actor explained it will be another year before he can visit @entity10			1
' i 'm questioning the system , ' he said			1
' at first i was certainly disappointed with my son , but i 've reached a point now where i 'm disappointed with the system			1
' @entity32 was convicted in 2010 of selling methamphetamine			1
winner : @entity2 was named @entity52 , but his son was in his thoughts a judge nearly doubled his sentence after he was found guilty of repeatedly breaking prison rules by arranging to get drugs			1
he is scheduled for release in 2018			2
' if you happen to have a slip , they punish you , ' the elder @entity2 said			2
' in my son 's case , he has spent almost two years in solitary confinement			2
' top honour : @entity2 looked dapper in a @entity69 suit , and beat out his co-star @entity70 as well as @entity71 , @entity72 and @entity73 @entity2 said he 's optimistic attorney general @entity74 might change laws involving non-violent drug offenders			1
from the stage , @entity2 also thanked his wife , @entity39 ' for your support '			1
that was an attention - getter following the announcement last month that the couple was taking ' some time apart to evaluate and work on their marriage			1
' @entity39 did not accompany her husband to the @entity30			1
she was in @entity87 this weekend			2
winning performance : @entity2 was awarded an @entity30 for his portrayal of flamboyant entertainer @entity16 apart from his emotional moments , @entity2 also let a few jokes slip out			1

' so i can say you were magnificent			2
you really deserve half of this			2

@entity126 , @entity127 , @entity128 , 1 day ago " @entity2 said he 's optimistic attorney general @entity74 might change laws involving non-violent drug offenders "			2
why ? how many lives ( beside his own ) has his kid ruined by peddling his drugs ? the guy was a major distributor of poison and a non-compliant inmate			2
he brought everything upon himself			2
i have no sympathy for either of them			0
@entity142 , @entity143 , 1 day ago well @entity2 is hardy the best role model for the father of the century award is he ? what with his track record			0
@entity149 , @entity150 , @entity128 , 1 day ago this punk is nothig but a snot nose wwho thinks he father an granfather gives hin privilages because of who he thinks he is			0
he is nothing more than a dirt bag drug @entity159 father should get off hi high horst and face the trurh			0
@entity164 , stockport , @entity163 , 1 day ago his son had enough chances before he was jailed and was born into a very rich lifestyle and he still threw it away for drugs			0
. so you cant really feel sorry for him			0
. @entity171 , @entity172 , 1 day ago " well obviously coddling & enabling the young man gave him a mentality that he was above the law			0
i see nothing wrong with punishing a person already in prison for selling drugs if they deal with drugs again while serving & i doubt @entity184 's statement is the full truth			0
- @entity187 the nurse , @entity188 , 23/9/2013 16:58 " ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ by your misguided logic @entity187 , all those who sells drugs or are in prison would come from families that " coddled and enabled " them			1
that 's sadly not the truth - far from it			1
his son is a severe addict who has the addict 's personality which leads them down the path of destruction			0
you claim to be a nurse but seem woefully ignorant of the origins and manifestations of addiction			0
is the answer prison or solitary confinement ? many would argue not			0
there 's not a good answer but i know that a good life is rooted in forgiveness and redemption			0
@entity215 , @entity216 , 1 day ago on one hand , @entity16 is probably rolling in his grave over this movie as he tried so hard to hide the fact he was so obviously gay			0
on the other hand , the shwowbiz part is probably happy someone remembers who he was as he has largely been forgotten and is unknown to young people not around during his heyday			0
@entity229 , @entity230 , 1 day ago i have no sympathy for @entity32 at all			0
@entity232 , @entity233 , 1 day ago looking great , @entity235 ! @entity236 , @entity237 , @entity128 , 1 day ago two years solitary for drug offenses			0
. they do n't give that much to a rapist ! @entity2 is right ! the time should fit the crime			0
. @entity243 , @entity143 , 1 day ago such a shame his son turned out to be a total loser			0
druggies very rarely change as they see nothing wrong with drugs			0
