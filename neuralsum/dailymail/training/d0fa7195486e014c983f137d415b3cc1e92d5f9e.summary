by @entity0 published : 07:56 est , 31 july 2013 updated : 01:44 est , 1 august 2013 auction : art enthusiast @entity2 who bought a picture he claims is an @entity5 original for £ 3 at a jumble sale has put the drawing up for sale for £ 1.25million an art enthusiast who bought a £ 3 sketch from a jumble sale that could be an original by @entity5 has put the drawing up for sale on @entity12 - with a minimum price of £ 1.25million			1
@entity2 , 49 , was astonished when experts said that one of a handful of unidentified sketches he picked up at a sale in @entity19 could be a previously unknown picture by the pop art legend from when he was aged 10 or 11			1
although the late 1930s pencil and graphite sketch has been formally valued at £ 1.3million , mr @entity2 says he has been told it could be worth up to ten times that			1
he says that if it was an original as claimed , the drawing of singer and actor @entity26 would move the birth of @entity30 back almost two decades and show @entity5 was already doing it in childhood			0
the @entity33 did not officially approve the sketch as @entity5 's work before it disbanded but he claims that experts from @entity37 and @entity38 's believe that it is an original piece by the iconic artist			1
he says that they are reluctant to speak publicly without authenticity from the @entity5 board			0
mr @entity2 , from @entity44 , @entity45 , said : ' i 've had experts from @entity38 's and @entity37 who are convinced it is original , without a shadow of doubt			1
' but without an official authentication boards approval they are reluctant to speak publicly			0
' i think it is an incredibly important work which redefines the work of one of the most famous artists of the last 100 years			0
' when i first found it i sent it to the @entity59 who wrote their unique number in the lower left corner			0
precious : mr @entity2 bought the picture in @entity19 and claims that more than one expert is convinced that it 's an original @entity5 doubt : questions have been raised about the authenticity of the 1930s drawing because it is signed @entity5 and the artist did n't change his name from @entity5 until 1949 ' they sent it back to me saying they did not have enough evidence to support the fact it could be real			1
' i think it 's important to note that when they have the slightest doubt about a piece they simply stamp " denied " on it in red letters			2
this was not the case with this picture			0
' since submitting it to the @entity59 i have done extensive research to prove beyond all reasonable doubt that it is genuine			2
' i am just sad that the @entity33 is no longer authenticating works of @entity5			0
' mr @entity2 claims the people who ultimately control the @entity5 market are reluctant to re-write history and acknowledge what would be @entity5 's earliest - known pop art work			1
he said : ' these people are so against this particular work being authentic because they simply do not wish to consider changing the facts that have formulated the current version of events @entity5 fans have become used to and have no control over a man who has found a lost piece of history			0
' expensive : the sketch has n't had any bids so far on the auction website claims : mr @entity2 says that if his picture is authentic it will push the birth date of pop art back a couple of decades but doubts do remain about the work			1
the piece it is signed ' @entity5 ' and he only changed his name from @entity5 in 1949			0
but mr @entity2 said he believes it is signed ' @entity5 ' rather than ' @entity5 ' because the artist only signed the work many years after he drew it			2
' the way the experts have explained it is that @entity5 never used to sign his early work , ' mr @entity2 added			1
' when he gave work away many years later it is highly likely he would have been asked to sign it			0
legend : work by @entity5 ( left ) has sold for as much as £ 65million			2
his painting @entity134 ( @entity133 ) sold for £ 5.6million he added : ' i am happy to be grilled by any expert in the world			0
' mr @entity2 picked up the artwork at a sale of property belonging to a man who told him his aunt had been a friend and carer of the sickly young @entity5			1
businessman mr @entity2 has put the drawing on @entity12 with a starting bid of £ 1.25 million and is inviting serious enquiries only			1
in october 2008 @entity5 's @entity149 painting was sold in a private sale for $ 100 million ( £ 65million ) - a record for his work			2
his painting @entity134 ( @entity133 ) sold for £ 5.6million two years ago - while @entity154 fetched £ 17.5million in 2007 .			0
