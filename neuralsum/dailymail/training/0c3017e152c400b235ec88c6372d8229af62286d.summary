he started by talking about the honour of taking his first few steps as @entity5 manager alongside sir @entity6			1
by the time @entity8 was up and running on thursday , however , it was clear he wo n’t need any assistance finding his own way in @entity13 football			2
it will be @entity15 ’s way or nothing			1
the 62 - year - old @entity17 was everything we had come to expect : at times abrasive , humble , charming and even funny			1
but , above all , there was a cast - iron belief in his football philosophy and the importance of others grasping it			1
he railed against his reputation as a dictator but this is not a man who is afraid to seek out confrontation or ruffle a few feathers			0
‘ within two days i know how important @entity5 is and how important the sponsors are , ’ he said			1
you could almost hear the uncomfortable fidgeting of men in suits			0
later he added , again unprompted : ‘ because of the greatness of this club it ’s also much more difficult than another club			2
‘ this club is guided in the commercial way and we have to fulfil that also			2
it ’s not always easy to fulfil commercial and football expectations			2
that is my big challenge after two days			0
’ on the issue of signings , @entity15 insisted he gave his ‘ approval ’ to the deals for @entity73 and @entity74			1
he will not demand any more arrivals until the existing squad have been given the chance to buy into his philosophy when they leave for a tour of @entity82 at lunchtime on friday			1
@entity17 of class : @entity8 ( centre ) made a generous donation to his favourite charity @entity89 man : @entity73 became @entity8 's first signing in a £ 28.4m deal beaming : @entity74 completed his £ 31.5million move as well , something which @entity15 okayed ‘ my method is always the same , ’ he said			1
‘ i want to look at the present players			0
i do n’t know the players until i have trained and coached them			0
' firstly , i want to see , over the first two , three , four weeks , how the players perform my philosophy and how quickly they can pick it up			1
then maybe i shall buy other players			0
’ asked about the importance of drawing on the experience of stars such as @entity104 , @entity15 ducked the easy option of offering a glowing tribute to the striker and instead issued a veiled warning to his squad that character will count for more than reputation			1
‘ i am not convinced of the experience of players , ’ he said			0
‘ it depends on the personality ; not always on age and football experience but also as a human being			2
‘ my philosophy is not just the player but the total			2
the three most important words in @entity15 ’s vocabulary , said a source close to him on thursday			1
he will spend the time on tour talking to his players and finding out everything about their upbringing , background , families and living habits			0
then he will assess the footballer			2
the personal touch and eye for detail is reminiscent of another former @entity5 manager			1
no 1 man : @entity8 is proudly unveiled as @entity5 manager with sir @entity6 ( right ) legends past ... and future : @entity15 exchanges a handshake with @entity47 icon @entity144 @entity146 reveal @entity148 injury ‘ sir @entity149 called to congratulate me and we have spoken about having a coffee or something to eat , ’ said @entity15			1
‘ sir @entity149 has a strong philosophy and that was confirmed because he won a lot of titles with @entity5			1
i have a strong philosophy			2
from the age of 39 , when i was coach of @entity162 , the personality has not changed			0
but autocratic and having a strong personality are not the same			0
‘ i am a democratic , empathetic human being			0
i have a strong personality but the other characteristics are more important			0
it ’s unfair because the media want to show that part of the personality			0
’ having again described @entity5 as the biggest club in the world , the former @entity162 , @entity171 and @entity172 coach also mentioned on two occasions that he has now worked for the top clubs in the four best leagues in @entity178			1
experience does n't matter : @entity104 will have to prove his worth at @entity5 under @entity15 he tried to take a @entity17 reporter to task on the latter point , briefly forgetting the original question , and there were withering stares for a couple of other journalists he felt were repeating themselves			1
but there was also evidence of that more human side			0
@entity15 would have preferred a break after the @entity42 to recharge			1
he asked for time and patience from @entity5 ’s owners and supporters			2
‘ i have to prepare a team and adapt to this big club , ’ he said			0
‘ it shall not be easy but i will do my utmost			0
and when you see my career you can see what i have won			0
‘ now i need all my knowledge to transfer my philosophy into this team			0
you have to give me time to do that			0
not only you , but the ceo and the owners			0
‘ it would have been better to have a sabbatical and come in january			2
but when you have been asked by the biggest club in the world , it ’s a challenge i will never let go			1
’ friendly : predecessor sir @entity149 ( left ) had a coffee with new @entity5 boss @entity15 ( right )			1

@entity15 was unveiled alongside @entity5 legend sir @entity6
@entity17 again showed his cast - iron belief in his own football philosophy
@entity15 addressed the fact that sponsors play a key part in the club
the 62 - year - old says he sanctioned @entity74 and @entity73 signings
@entity17 will assess squad over coming weeks before making additions
he revealed he had coffee with predecessor sir @entity149
@entity15 said it would have been nice to have had a sabbatical and come back in january but ' the biggest club in the world ' came calling
