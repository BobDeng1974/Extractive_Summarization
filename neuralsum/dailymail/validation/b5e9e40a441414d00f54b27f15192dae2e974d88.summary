they are not the first places which come to mind when making a booking , but as these pictures show , there are some rather interesting restaurant loos in the @entity7			0
there has been an increase in restaurants providing much more than just a meal , and as these designer toilets show , restaurants are now fighting to make themselves more memorable			2
whether it 's the incredible views at @entity16 , @entity18 's futuristic pods or @entity20 's x-rated sink ornaments , the loo is another chance for a venue to impress , and restaurants are grasping this opportunity with both hands			2
weird cocooned pods comprise the intergalactic space - age landscape in the @entity29 loo @entity31 's @entity30 : a work of dazzling art , you may have trouble upon both entry and escape from these labyrinthine lavatories ' over the last few years we 've seen a marked increase in restaurants that provide much more than just a meal to the customer ; these venues use every aspect of their customer experience to pack a real punch and make themselves more memorable , ' said @entity49 , @entity50 at @entity51			1
' a big part of this has been designer toilets which often surprise diners with their fun and quirky designs at a point during a meal when all we really expect to see are cubicles and sinks , ' she continued			2
from loos running retro nature documentaries and pre-warmed toilet seats which powder your bum once you 've finished to phallic tap fittings and rusty cans serving as urinals , here at 14 of the @entity7 's strangest loos			1
@entity29 , @entity73 some wonderfully weird cocooned pods comprise the intergalactic space - age landscape in the @entity29 lavatories			2
whilst you are in the dinosaur - egg pod , your ears will be treated to the soothing sounds of retro nature documentaries			2
oh , and there are @entity84 maids , just to further enhance the already esoteric setting			0
the @entity86 , @entity87 who would have thought that a trumpet could double as a urinal ? the @entity86 prove that you can simultaneously blow your horn and take a leak in their trumpet urinals			1
hitting all the right notes with their wonderful quirks and boutique artefacts , @entity86 is a hidden restaurant and inn with bold - as - brass swagger in @entity102 , @entity87			1
the @entity103 in @entity105 's gloriously rustic bucket urinals where each visit really does end up in the can blowing your own trumpet : the men 's loos in @entity86 , @entity112 feature trumpets which double as urinals 3			1
@entity114 , @entity115 not that we 'd encourage illicit voyeurism but at @entity114 it 's all too easy to get a glimpse into the dark side via the dazzlingly glam , open communal sinks			2
you enter via a concealed mirrored door , but be warned : all that glitters is seemingly not gold			0
with all the mirror action it can be tricky to distinguish male and females loos apart so take care not to accidentally intrude			0
@entity131 , @entity132 having made a real splash with their innovative video game toilets , @entity133 are on a mission to revolutionise lavatorial interior design			1
even though they were rebuffed on @entity139 , they have gone onto furnish numerous restaurant bars with video game urinals , including venues in @entity143 and @entity132			2
open into the wee small hours , @entity144 and @entity145 is surely the front - runner for toilet gaming technology in @entity132			2

@entity175 , @entity176 @entity175 wins the prize in the stakes for adrenaline - fuelled toilet highs			2
you can take in the spectacular @entity143 skyline with these city - slicking powder rooms 31 floors up , surrounded by 180 - degree @entity143 views			2

the @entity103 , @entity105 named @entity200 of @entity201 in 2011 , @entity199 near @entity105 bring their unique brand of boutique style - chic to @entity204 , but it does n't quite extend as far as the toilets			1

' simple , yes , but it does the job			0
@entity212 , @entity213 talk about shooting from the lip			0
after less than favourable reviews from restaurant critics , @entity20 has taken some stick for its lascivious , lipstick - mouthed lavs in the men 's			1
for the ladies there are sophisticated , golden phallic taps			0
the attendant , @entity115 this is getting a bit meta			0
toilets within toilets ? the attendant 's key selling point is the humble water closet and it commodes your attention at every turn			1
after 50 years lying abandoned , these 19th - century washrooms reveal ornate @entity115 porcelains converted into a dining table that 's so clean you could eat your dinner off it			1
do n't worry , it 's been mega-deep - cleaned to within an inch of its life			1
and the toilets are n't bad either			2
going down the pan ? @entity20 's lascivious , lipstick - mouthed lavs ( left ) and risque loo fittings ( right ) 10			1
@entity31 , @entity249 the menu at @entity31 is rustic and directional , yet simple			1
a work of dazzling art , you may have trouble upon both entry and escape from these labyrinthine mirror lavatories , like a nostalgic @entity30			1
be sure to tell your guests that if you 're not out in ten , send reinforcements to rescue you from the never - ending mind - trickery of the mirror maze			0
mayor of @entity263 , @entity265 it 's all rather cloak and dagger here			0
you need to ask to ' see the mayor ' to get entry via a fridge to this secret speakeasy hangout , before taking a twisted trip back to your childhood via the fake exit door of the @entity277 - clad lavs			0
if you 're not into the @entity279 ( adult fan of @entity277 ) thing , then you could skip by the mayor of @entity263			0
creepy commode : a distorted fairground soundtrack , dark lighting and spider - webbed walls at @entity18 , @entity73 @entity213 's abracadabra with its phallic taps in the women 's loos ( left ) and heart covered walls ( right ) while @entity291 did n't actually invent the humble toilet , he founded a plumbing company which now lends its name to these authentic retro - style thrones , found in @entity297 's @entity296 , @entity298 12			1
@entity18 , @entity73 love checking the lavs when you visit a restaurant ? sketch features washrooms that just keep on giving , with not just one but two sets of crazy khazis			0
@entity308 - inspired , crystal - decked creations that are truly worthy of the royal throne mantel can be found on the way to sketch @entity311			0
a departure from the dinosaur space eggs but almost equally intriguing with a distorted fairground soundtrack and spider web - spangled walls of mystery			0
@entity152 , @entity153 @entity152 has earned its stripes in the exotic khazi stakes with a @entity151 - zapped world of glorious toilet heaven			0
no , it 's not safari road kill : it 's art. it takes a lot of dollar to achieve this simple yet ostentatious pony - stripe effect			1
14 @entity297 's @entity296 , @entity298 contrary to popular belief , @entity291 did n't actually invent the humble toilet			0
however , he founded a plumbing company which now lends its name to these authentic retro - style thrones			0
@entity333 clearly favours an authentic variety of toilet seat and has installed these loos across his restaurant group , including @entity297 's @entity296 in @entity298 which features an original @entity291 toilet .			0
