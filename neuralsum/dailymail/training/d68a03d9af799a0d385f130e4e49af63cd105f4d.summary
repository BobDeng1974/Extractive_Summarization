a man whose scrotum swelled to weigh more than 130lb has spoken of his relief after he had most of removed via surgery			2
@entity4 , from @entity5 , drew international attention last year for the mass that made his day - to - day life a nightmare			1
but he is now recovering after a team of surgeons in @entity12 led by dr @entity13 spent nearly 13 hours operating on the 48 - year - old for free			1
' my body is acclimatising , ' he told @entity32			2
' i 'm still not able to get around much and enjoy driving or going to dinner			2
but i intend to make up for it and treat myself to a truly fabulous meal and enjoy relaxing for at least a few days			2
' he said he would like to enjoy a meal of scampi served over fettuccini with a rack of lamb - having been eating only vegetarian meals at the nursing home			1
' it 's all part of the pathetic life one has to deal with trying to recuperate from such a devastating handicap , ' he said			1
' i call dr. @entity13 my lifesaver , and i 'm grateful to him and all those caring fans of ' the @entity49 ' that have supported me through this , ' he said			1
' i can not express , ' he added , with an emotional pause			0
' enough can not be said			0
' on april 8 , @entity13 and three other physicians cut away simultaneously on the grossly enlarged protective sac of skin and muscles that contained @entity4 's testicles and penis , according to the @entity58			1
' there are a lot of shows about makeovers , but this is a real makeover , ' dr. @entity13 , who heads the @entity59 at the @entity60 , said of the procedure			0
' he 's basically a new man			0
' the mass caused by the condition , known as scrotal lymphedema , had grown to 132 pounds in less than two years			1
@entity4 , who has blood pressure problems and asthma , had previously spoken of his fear of dying during surgery			1
' i 'd say we put that fear to rest , ' @entity13 told the newspaper			0
the patient was hospitalized for two weeks , with one of those weeks spent in intensive care			1
the medical center told the @entity58 that he was able to get up , walk and start physical therapy within a week of surgery			0
@entity4 is now recuperating in housing near the hospital but it 's not clear how long he 'll have to stay in @entity12			1
' there is a lot of follow - up to do , ' @entity13 said			2
the @entity5 man last year seemed to be basking in the fame that his giant organ had brought him after an initial interview with the @entity58			1
it was even said the attention was the reason he initially turned down @entity13 's offer to perform the $ 1 million corrective surgery because he would have had to give up the rights to his story			2
a second doctor also agreed to waive most of the cost for the procedure but @entity4 said he stalled because of his fear of bleeding out on the operating table			1
the watermelon - size scrotum @entity4 carried between his legs landed him on the @entity49 and @entity107 and made him a local celebrity in his hometown			1
@entity110 , the company behind ' @entity111 ' signed a contract to make a documentary about him , which included the surgery			0
and he also shot a segment for @entity116			0
when @entity4 spoke with a reporter for the @entity58 in october 2011 , he became emotional as he described the pain and humiliation of carrying the deformed genitals			1
he said he suffered from deep bouts of depression and health complications			0
he had to wear a hooded sweatshirt on his legs when he was out in public to contain his enormous scrotum			0
his penis was buried so deeply in the abnormal growth that he was forced to urinate on himself			0
he only wanted to urinate like a normal man and have a romantic relationship with a woman , he said			0
@entity4 claimed he was going public to raise money so he could afford the operation -- which required the trip to the special surgeon			1
' i do n't like being a freak , who would ? ' he told the @entity58			0
but his reaction to an offer he received from dr @entity141 , the celebrity physician whom @entity142 made famous , was disturbing			2
@entity4 claimed the dr @entity143 said it would pay for the entire surgery at a top - notch hospital			1
however , the show would keep exclusive rights to tell his story			0
he said he did n't take the tv program up on its offer because @entity152 wanted him on his show again			0
but he also said the highly complicated surgery had him fearing he could die on the operating table			2
the massive swelling is caused by fluid building up in his scrotum			0
doctors had to remove the excess tissue and then completely rebuild his scrotum			0
there was also a chance that complications could force the surgeons to cut off his genitals if his scrotum did n't stop bleeding			2
' i still have n't lost a patient or a testicle ( in patients with problems similar to @entity4 's ) , ' @entity13 told the @entity58			1
the extremely rare condition is much more common in @entity172 and @entity173 , where it is caused by parasites , than it is in the western world			0
@entity4 says he contracted it somehow when he hit his testicle with his own leg while turning in bed one morning but @entity13 said he ' had no idea ' how the man contracted it .			1
