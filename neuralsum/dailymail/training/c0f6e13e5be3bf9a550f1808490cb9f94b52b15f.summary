former president @entity0 recently said he ' could have wiped @entity1 off the map with the weapons we had ' during the @entity1 hostage crisis			1

@entity0 made the remarks during an episode of @entity11 after @entity12 asked him ' do you feel there were any choices you would have made differently ? ' ' i think i would have been re-elected easily if i had been able to rescue our hostages from the @entity1 , ' @entity0 said on the program			2
' and everybody asks me what would do more , i would say i would send one more helicopter because if i had one more helicopter we could have brought out not only the 52 hostages , but also brought out the rescue team , and when that failed , then i think that was the main factor that brought about my failure to be re-elected			0
so that 's one thing i would change			0
' but , er , i think if i , i could have wiped @entity1 off the map with the weapons that we had , but in the process a lot of innocent people would have been killed , probably including the hostages and so i stood up against all that , er , all that advice , and then eventually my prayers were answered and every hostage came home safe and free			1
and so i think i made the right decision in retrospect , but it was not easy at the time			0
