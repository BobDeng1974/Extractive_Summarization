dr @entity9 was sentenced to 33 years in prison in june after a @entity3 court found him guilty of treason for conspiring against @entity3			1
the physician said he has been subjected to torture and harsh questioning since his arrest days after @entity6 ’s death in may 2011 as he tried to flee @entity3			2
and he also claimed that he did not know that the information he provided to the @entity19 had led to the assassination of the reclusive @entity22 leader			0
the good doctor : dr @entity9 was convicted of treason in june , and sentenced to 33 years in prison despite leading the @entity4 to @entity6 's hideout in @entity27 , @entity3 in an interview with @entity30 from his @entity3 jail cell , dr @entity9 says he has been told : ‘ you helped our enemies			1
' they said " the @entity4 are our worst enemies , worse than the @entity36			0
" ' dr @entity9 said he tried to defend the @entity4 as allies and supporters of @entity3			1
he told @entity30 news : ' i tried to argue that @entity4 was @entity3 's biggest supporter - billions and billions of dollars in aid , social and military assistance - but all they said was , " these are our worst enemies			1
" ' speaking out : dr @entity9 helped the @entity19 track down @entity6 and turned down an opportunity to leave @entity3 and resettle overseas with his family dr @entity9 also warned that any cooperation by @entity3 is just a front for the country to collect billions of dollars in aid from the @entity4 “ it is now indisputable that militancy in @entity3 is supported by the @entity56 … @entity3 ’s fight against militancy is bogus			1
it ’s just to extract money from @entity4			0
' dr @entity9 helped the @entity19 by running a fake vaccination programme that allowed him to collect the dna of @entity6 ’s children from the family compound in @entity27			1
sample analysis confirmed the terror leader was probably there and triggered the deadly mission by @entity69 last may			0
the successful mission sparked a rift between the @entity4 and @entity3 leaders who were embarrassed that @entity6 had been living in a major military hub close to the capital			2
dead : the killing of notorious terror leader @entity6 led to a decline in the relationship between @entity3 and the @entity4 imprisoned : @entity3 doctor @entity9 talks with people outside a building at an unknown location , prior to his arrest shortly after the raid which killed @entity6 , dr @entity9 was arrested for conspiring against the state of @entity3 and last month jailed for 33 years			1
in may , outraged at dr @entity9 's conviction , @entity86 panels voted overwhelmingly to cut aid to @entity89 by $ 33million - one million for every year of the physician 's 33 - year sentence for high treason			1
and perhaps @entity3 is feeling the pinch , as the doctor also claims that his life savings has been depleted after the @entity56 drained his bank accounts			2
dr @entity9 told @entity30 : ' my bank account was looted , making me bankrupt			2
i need financial , legal and diplomatic help			0
' mission : the @entity22 leader was killed at this compound in @entity27 by @entity103 he added : ' my situation is very grim			0
i earned millions of rupees ( tens of thousands of dollars ) a year and supported my family and that of my brother			0
all of that is lost			0
' while dr. @entity9 is appealing his conviction , his chances are slim because of the arbitrary nature of the tribal court system where he is facing justice in @entity3			0
officials from the @entity4 have revealed in the past that they attempted to extricate dr @entity9 from @entity3 in the weeks after the @entity6 raid			1
unnamed @entity4 officials said the resettlement offer for @entity9 came around the time of the may 1 , 2011 , raid in which @entity69 commandos killed the @entity22 chief at his complex in @entity27 , @entity3			2
tense : the moment president @entity126 and his team watched the mission to find @entity6 in the @entity129 of the @entity130 on may 1 , 2011			0
