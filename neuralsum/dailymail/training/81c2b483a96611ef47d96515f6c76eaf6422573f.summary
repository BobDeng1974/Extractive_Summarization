@entity0 may have been born in @entity1 but he insists he will be the proudest scot on show if he is given his @entity4 debut on saturday			1
the son of a @entity8 mother and @entity10 father , the 28 - year - old is in line to make his bow at the home of the @entity14 when they host @entity15 this weekend			1
the @entity17 back - rower already has three caps for @entity20 's men after being called - up for the summer tour of the @entity22			1
@entity17 flanker @entity0 is looking forward to his home debut for @entity24 at @entity25 fiercely proud of his @entity8 roots , he was already looking forward to the chance of running out at the famous @entity29 arena for the first time			1
but the fact that his mum @entity32 - born in the small village of @entity34 near @entity35 before emigrating to @entity1 with her parents - has flown half - way round the world to see the first @entity39 has pushed his patriotic sensitivities into over-drive			1
he said : ' my family are very @entity8 orientated			1
since coming up here and seeing the values in people , i can see where my family got it from			0
@entity1 - born backrower @entity48 has been in excellent form for the @entity50 this season ' my grandad , my uncle , my mum - they are all based in @entity1 but are all very @entity8			1
they were born here and raised here			2
' do n't get me wrong , i 'm very proud of my father 's side and where i grew up			2
but a lot of the stuff that has been driven into me comes from my @entity8 side			1
' my @entity8 family are all very proud people , very passionate			1
i think that shows in the way i play			0
i wear my heart on my sleeve			0
' when i call my grandad to give him some good news , he still gets a crack in his voice			0
that almost brings me to tears			0
so now it is really nice to represent @entity24 on behalf of my family as well			0
' my family has been the backbone to my career so i owe them a lot when i go out to play			0
' @entity24 and @entity81 stalwart @entity80 has been left out of @entity20 's squad for the @entity83 @entity48 first moved to the @entity84 in 2009 when he signed for @entity86			1
as spell at @entity88 then led to his move to the @entity50			1
he has even toured @entity24 when his sister married her partner in @entity29			0
but the atmosphere of a packed - out @entity25 is something he has still to savour			2
' i got a taste of playing for @entity24 during the summer but now i 've got my eyes set on playing at @entity25 , ' said the @entity98 - born flanker			1
@entity99 ( right ) has been invited to train with the @entity24 squad after @entity101 was ruled out with an injury ' that would be a huge honour and probably the highlight of my career if i get the chance			0
' i 'm dying to get out there			0
my mum has just come over to visit myself and my brother			0
it would be the first time in six years that i have played in front of her			0
' to play in front of the @entity8 crowd would be huge but to play in front of my family makes it even more special			1
' @entity48 's inclusion in @entity20 's latest squad is also notable because is seems to have spelt the end of former skipper @entity80 's international career			1
but with a @entity126 just 10 months away , the new man in the squad is refusing to let the fall - out of that episode ruin his big chance			2
he said : ' @entity80 has obviously been a huge part of @entity8 rugby and i have the utmost respect for him			2
' but @entity20 knows what he wants			2
that 's the nature of professional sport and i 'm just lucky enough to be what @entity20 is after			1
' @entity80 's absence is the elephant in the room but i have put it behind me and i 'm just concentrating on my job			2
' i want to take the next step with @entity24			0
i was reasonably happy with the end - of - year tour but there was still things i could improve on			2
now is a chance to show exactly what i can do if i get the opportunity to play			0
' meanwhile , @entity99 has been invited to train with the squad after @entity29 prop @entity101 was ruled out with a leg injury			0
@entity99 , who toured @entity149 with the 2013 @entity150 , is only just back from shoulder surgery himself but could end up replacing @entity152 after he was injured in the @entity154 ' 33 - 8 defeat to @entity155 in @entity156 on friday .			0
