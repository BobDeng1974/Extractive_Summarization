by @entity0 published : 15:09 est , 11 december 2012 updated : 15:35 est , 11 december 2012 thousands of gay couples in civil partnerships will be able to ‘ convert ’ their relationships to marriage in return for a £ 100 administration fee			1
around 50,000 couples will be able to change the legal status of their relationship by simply filling in a form and popping it in the post along with a cheque to cover the cost of issuing a marriage certificate			1
in effect , the change in the law will mean that some gay couples will be able to get married without even having a wedding , with the result that some couples could become married in secret			0
love - ly law : the new legislation means civil partners will be able to change the legal status of their relationship to marriage but @entity30 mp @entity29 said the decision would further undermine the status of marriage			1
mr @entity29 said : ‘ the government is sending out the very dispiriting message that it does n’t care about marriage			2
‘ the idea that people will be able to get married by simply filling in a form and paying £ 100 is a further dilution of the institution of marriage that the government claims to care about			0
that is clearly not what marriage means to millions of married couples in this country			0
’ criticism : @entity30 mp @entity29 says the government 's decision undermines the status of marriage documents issued by the @entity54 yesterday suggested that couples in civil partnerships will have a choice about whether or not to hold a separate ceremony to mark the conversion of their relationship to marriage			1
‘ we will enable couples to have a ceremony upon conversion should they wish to do so			0
' the ceremony would have no legal effect and would be similar to existing ceremonies allowing couples to renew their vows ( and would therefore incur a separate cost )			0
accordingly a couple would be able to have such a ceremony on religious premises , if agreed with the religious organisation and any representatives of that organisation who would be involved in the ceremony			0
’ despite the change , married couples will not be able to convert their relationships into civil partnerships			1
officials said there was ‘ no justification or requirement for introducing such a process ’			0
and , to the dismay of some campaigners , ministers refused to extend civil partnerships legislation to cover heterosexual relationships			1
gay rights campaigner @entity94 condemned the decision , saying : ‘ retaining the ban on opposite - sex civil partnerships is a huge failing			1
it deprives heterosexual couples of legal equality			2
i strongly support the right of straight people to equal treatment			0
' wedding bells : if civil partners so wish they can have a ceremony to mark their conversion which would function as a renewing of their vows and not have any legal effect he added : ‘ under the government ’s plans , gay couples will soon have legal privileges over heterosexual couples			2
‘ there will be two forms of official state recognition for lesbian and gay couples : the present system of civil partnerships plus marriage			1
heterosexual couples will have only one option - marriage			2
’ in a further change , heterosexual couples will no longer have to divorce if one partner has a sex change			0
if both partners agree they will be able to retain their married status			0
the government announced today that it will introduce a bill next year legalizing gay marriage - but banning the @entity137 from conducting same - sex ceremonies .			1

conversion would see same - sex couple able to change the legal status of their civil partnership
equality campaigners condemn decision not to allow straight marriages to convert into civil partnerships
@entity30 mp @entity29 say it undermines marriage
