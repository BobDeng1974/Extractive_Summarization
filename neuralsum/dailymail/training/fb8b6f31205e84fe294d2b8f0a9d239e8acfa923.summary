by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter published : 16:23 est , 3 october 2013 updated : 08:53 est , 4 october 2013 @entity3 has finally laid itself bare in an 800 - page filing released late thursday as it prepares for an eagerly anticipated ipo			1
the documents reveal that @entity3 is planning to raise $ 1 billion for its upcoming ipo			1
with its initial valuation expected to be more than $ 10 billion , those with a large stake in the company are expected to get a huge payday when it goes public			1
but the major stakeholders identified in the documents exclude one key player - @entity3 co-founder @entity16			1
@entity16 , who founded the company with ceo @entity18 and @entity19 , is n't listed in the documents , meaning he does n't own enough stock to trigger legal disclosures			2
that suggests he likely unloaded at least a portion of his stake when he left the company in 2011			0
@entity18 founded @entity3 in 2006 when he was 29 years old			0
he now serves as chairman as for @entity18 and @entity19 , the ipo will make them billionaires			0
@entity19 , @entity3 's former ceo , owns a 12 percent stake in the company			2
if @entity3 turns out to be worth at least $ 17.60 per share in the ipo , @entity19 will be a billionaire at 41 years old			1
he remains on @entity3 's board of directors			2
another board member , @entity32 , and his venture capital firm , @entity33 , own a 6.7 percent stake			0
next in line with a 4.9 percent stake is @entity18 , who came up for the idea for @entity3 with @entity16 and @entity38			1
@entity38 's shares are n't listed in the documents			0
many of @entity3 's 2,000 employees could become rich , too , if the company 's stock fares well			2
they wo n't be allowed to sell their stock until feb. 15 , at the earliest			0
through the first half of this year , @entity3 's revenue totaled $ 254 million , more than doubling from last year			1
if @entity3 maintains that growth pace through the second half , the company 's revenue will surpass $ 656 million this year			1
all told , @entity3 generated $ 317 million in revenue in 2012			1
@entity3 gets 87 percent of its revenue from advertising			2
the rest comes from licensing agreements that give other companies better access to the flow of tweeting activity on its service			0
meanwhile , @entity3 ended june with 218 million users , up from 30 million in early 2010			2
more than three - quarters of those users , or 169 million people , are located outside the @entity67 @entity3 's fastest growing markets are in @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 and @entity73			1
bust the company is n't profitable			0
it takes more than cultural heft to build a business of substance , as @entity3 is learning			0
the company has suffered uninterrupted losses of $ 419 million since its inception			0
that 's something @entity3 has been able to afford because it has raised $ 759 million from investors			1
the company still had $ 375 million in the bank at the end of june and hopes to raise at least $ 1 billion more in its ipo			1
but shareholders of publicly held companies do n't tolerate losses for very long , and it could still be a while before @entity3 turns a profit			0
@entity3 's losses widened during the first half of this year to $ 69 million , up from $ 49 million in the same period last year			1
in contrast , both social networking leader @entity94 and professional networking leader @entity96 were profitable when they went public			0
to make money , @entity3 will likely get more aggressive about showing ads. in the three months ending in june , @entity3 generated revenue of $ 139 million , or an average of just 64 cents per user			1
in contrast , @entity94 generated second - quarter revenue of nearly $ 1.2 billion , or an average of $ 1.58 per user , while @entity96 posted revenue of $ 364 million , or an average of $ 1.53 per user			1
growth by numbers : the company has only been in existence for seven years but has clearly made a dent @entity3 co-founder @entity18 ( right ) attended the @entity116 tech conference in july with girlfriend @entity117 as @entity3 cranks up its marketing machine , it runs the risk of alienating an audience accustomed to seeing relatively few ads in their news feeds			1
beyond the @entity67 , @entity3 is gearing to expand its advertising efforts in @entity124 , @entity125 , @entity126 , @entity70 and the @entity127			0
the first tangible sign of @entity3 's desire to go public came in the middle of last month when they tweeted that they submitted their flotation application to the @entity135 @entity3 did not say which stock exchange it plans to list its shares on			2
the influx of cash into the company will mean the beginning of serious expansion , as @entity143 reports that they are planning to lease a 320,000 - square - foot office space directly next to their current headquarters in @entity147			0
@entity19 age : 41 net worth : $ 1 - $ 2billion role : co-founder and former chief executive of @entity3 @entity18 age : 36 net worth : $ 1.1billion role : executive chairman at @entity3 , ceo at @entity158 @entity16 age : 39 net worth : thought to be around $ 200million role : co-inventor and co-founder of @entity3 , ceo of @entity165 the move to go public is one of the most highly anticipated ipos in tech history with @entity3 the last of the major social networking sites to go public			1
it comes after @entity94 floated on the @entity67 stock market in may 2012 for $ 104 billion ( Â£ 66.2 billion ) and , despite seeing an initial slump in shares , has since had a resurgence			2
it is thought that like @entity94 , @entity3 bosses ' hands were forced by the @entity179 which requires a @entity67 firm to file an ipo once it has reached 2,000 investors			2
the company has been ramping up its advertising products and working to boost ad revenue in preparation for the ipo			0
but it is still small in comparison to @entity94 , which saw its highly anticipated ipo implode last year amid worries about its ability to grow mobile ad revenue			1
twitter site was founded in march 2006 and has become one of the world 's most popular social networking sites over the past seven years			0
@entity18 's interest in programming began at the ripe age of eight , according to a 2011 @entity201 article			0
he came up with the idea for @entity3 in his 20s and shared it with @entity16 and @entity19 , two of his bosses at @entity147 software start - up @entity205			1
@entity19 embraced the idea and made @entity18 , who was 29 at the time , the founding ceo of the new company			0
@entity16 , 39 , and @entity19 , 41 , have also helped create @entity209 , @entity210 , and a host of other @entity213 ventures			0
@entity18 is currently thought to be worth around $ 1.1billion			0
@entity16 's wealth is estimated to be worth $ 200million while @entity19 , thought to be the richest of the three , is worth about $ 2billion			2
faring better : @entity3 will surely try to learn from the mistakes of @entity94 , as the social media giant 's stock price took a massive and prolonged hit after a much - hyped ipo in 2012 though just recently it bounced back @entity3 was created back in march 2006 but its popularity soon went through the roof with more than 500 million users registered worldwide as of last year and more than 500 million tweets sent a day			1
