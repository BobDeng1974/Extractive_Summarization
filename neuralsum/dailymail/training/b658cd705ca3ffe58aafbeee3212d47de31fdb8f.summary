in a written statement , addressing the question of what ethical issues need to be held in mind by a journalist communicating with the police , he said : ' the main ethical issue is that we never pay police officers for stories or seek to put the police in a position where they feel that they should provide information to us in exchange for anything that they consider that they are getting from us			1
