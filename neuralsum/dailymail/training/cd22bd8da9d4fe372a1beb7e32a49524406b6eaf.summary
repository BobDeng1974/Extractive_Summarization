@entity0 is facing defeat in his bid to enter @entity3 next year , a new poll has revealed @entity6 leader @entity0 is facing defeat in his bid to become an mp in next year 's general election , a new poll has suggested			2
the survey , carried out for former @entity11 treasurer @entity10 , found that mr @entity0 is trailing the conservatives by five points in @entity14 - on 29 per cent , to 34 per cent for @entity16 's party and 26 per cent for @entity17			1
a similar survey in july gave him a four - point lead in the @entity21 constituency			1
the same poll suggests deputy prime minister @entity23 faces a tough fight to hold onto his @entity26 seat , with a narrow advantage of just three points over @entity17			1
just 31 per cent of voters in mr @entity23 's constituency told pollsters they will back mr @entity23 in may			1
at the 2010 general election the @entity33 lead held his seat with 53 per cent of the vote			0
but the poll bolstered mr @entity23 's hopes of hanging onto a sizeable number of mps in the 2015 election , suggesting that many sitting @entity33 are ' entrenched ' in their constituencies and could save their seats by outstripping the party 's national performance			2
@entity48 's 26 - point general election lead in @entity49 , meanwhile , has been squeezed to 12 points , and the poll suggested he could be vulnerable to tactical voting			1
the combined total of @entity6 and @entity11 supporters - making up just over half the electorate in mr @entity48 's constituency - top the 40 per cent who said they will vote @entity17			2
in a further blow for the @entity17 leader just 35 per cent in his @entity59 constituency said they would rather have mr @entity48 than mr @entity16 as @entity63			0
but when asked to choose their favourite pm from the four main party leaders , almost a quarter ( 24 per cent ) of mr @entity48 's constituents plumped for him , compared to 23 per cent who picked mr @entity16			0
mr @entity23 claimed that @entity33 will retain most of their 56 mps in next year 's election despite dismal opinion poll ratings , which have put them as low as 6 per cent nationally , and their recent lost deposit in the @entity73 by - election , where they finished fifth behind the @entity75			1
' @entity6 have got two mps , the @entity75 have got one			0
we have got 56 and we will retain the vast , vast majority of those , ' the @entity33 leader told @entity82			0
' i really do think when people come to put the cross on the ballot paper they will say ' who 's done stuff for me and my family ? '			0
' on that , we are going to be very proud and we are going to stick our logo on our leaflets and say ' we did it '			0
' @entity23 could lose his seat to the @entity17 in may next year , a poll by the @entity11 peer @entity10 has shown the @entity10 poll , which focused on marginal @entity33 seats as well as party leaders ' constituencies , appeared to give some backing to mr @entity23 's analysis			2
of 11 key marginals where @entity33 are under challenge from conservatives , the poll suggested mr @entity23 's party would hold onto nine - including energy secretary @entity112 's @entity111 , @entity113 , @entity114 , @entity115 , @entity116 , @entity117 and @entity118 - while losing @entity108 and @entity109 , where mp @entity110 is sitting as an independent			1
@entity17 was primed to win back @entity120 , but would fail in its attempt to gain @entity122 from the @entity33 , the poll suggested .			0

mr @entity0 is trailing the conservatives by five points in @entity14
a similar survey in july gave him a 4 - point lead in the @entity21 constituency
@entity23 also faces a tough fight to hold onto his @entity26 seat
