the science correspondent appeared on the today show on tuesday to share how he 's adjusting to life just a month after losing his arm while abroad on assignment			1
the 54 - year - old was wrapping up reporting trips to @entity18 and the @entity19 when he dropped a suitcase of television camera equipment on his arm			1
' when i think of all the risky things i 've done in my life - jumping out of airplanes , flying little airplanes , scuba diving - the fact that a heavy equipment case could take my arm is mind - boggling , ' he said			2
the doctor admitted him into a local hospital for acute compartment syndrome , where internal pressure builds within a muscle compartment and stops blood flow			0
he underwent surgery to relieve the pressure and was warned that he might have to have an amputation if the condition was particularly severe			2
when he woke up , his arm was amputated above the elbow - but he could feel it			2
shock : @entity3 dropped luggage on his arm and when the pain became worse after 2 days he went to a doctor - who rushed him to surgery			1
when he woke up he discovered his arm had been amputated life - changing : an image shows from where the limb was amputated - complete with ' no chew ' tape ' i felt my arm as if it was there , ' he told @entity63			1
' i thought , " ok , i dodged that bullet ! and then you look down , and it 's like , " uh oh , that did not go well			0
" that was not a good moment for sure			0
' despite the life - changing procedure , @entity3 told no one			2
' if i had told everybody and they flew in , i would have felt like i had to take care of them , ' he said			2
' i frankly just wanted some time on my own to sort this whole thing out , try to get my head together on it , much to the chagrin of my family and friends , that i did n't say anything			0
' i think for me , it was the way to do it			0
' instead , he focused on work and completing a project for the anniversary of the earthquake in @entity18 , where he had been before the earthquake			0
he got himself to the airport and revealed his news when he returned home , as well as in a blog post on february 25			0
adjusting : @entity3 recently figured out how to open a bottle of wine with one hand , pictured technology : he is using a mirror for his phantom limb pain			1
when he makes a movement with his missing arm , he copies the movement with his remaining arm in the mirror - and miraculously , the pain subsides treatment : he is pictured undergoing acupuncture treatment for the phantom limb pain now he is slowly coming to grips with every day tasks and recently celebrated opening a bottle of wine on his own			1
but he is also exploring ways to alleviate his phantom limb pain with the help of a ' mirror box '			1
' you 're tricking yourself into believing your arm is there , ' he said			0
' you use a mirror and you look at it and you try to move your phantom limb , which i feel very much			1
' match that movement with the limb that 's left , and your brain starts thinking , " oh , the arm 's there " â € ™ and that alleviates some of that phantom pain			1
i do n't think anybody really knows why			0
' he now hopes to ride his bike , fly a plane and shoot video - all activities he did before the injury			1
doctors have told him that prosthetics will make all of these possible			2
recovering : science correspondent @entity3 ( center ) speaking with reporter - producer @entity143 ( left ) and senior online editor @entity144 on friday ' the technology has really gone in leaps and bounds , sadly because of the wars , but that technology is something i will take advantage of as time goes on , ' he said			1
' you have to decide what you need the device , the gadget , for			0
