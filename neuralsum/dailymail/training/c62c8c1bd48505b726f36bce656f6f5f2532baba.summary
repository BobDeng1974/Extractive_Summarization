by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 04:53 est , 12 august 2013 updated : 10:07 est , 12 august 2013 @entity3 ’s hopes of building a brand new @entity5 airport have suffered a major blow after the world ’s biggest airlines refused to leave @entity9			1
the @entity5 mayor has called for the @entity5 airport to be bulldozed and replaced with a brand new hub on the @entity13			1
but all of the major global alliances of airlines have baulked at the idea of abandoning @entity9 as part of plans to increase airport capacity			1
blow : @entity5 mayor @entity3 has called for @entity9 to be bulldozed and flights moved to a new hub airport , but airlines are refusing to budge staying put : @entity26 is among the world 's leading airlines refusing to leave @entity9 the @entity29 is due to deliver its first report to the government by the end of this year and its final report by the summer of 2015			1
after furious protests from local people , at the last election the @entity34 vowed to oppose @entity9 expansion			2
but @entity39 ordered the @entity40 to explore the best option for expanding capacity			2
last month @entity9 bosses unveiled their radical plans for a four runway ‘ super-hub ’ handling up to a million flights a year			0
they revealed three options for a controversial new third runway to double annual passenger numbers — and win the race to be @entity53 ’s main international hub airport			0
the @entity40 could recommend the @entity54 having a second hub alongside @entity9 , with at least one of the airlines alliances moved elsewhere			1
but @entity26 has insisted it wants to stay at @entity9 , and has the backing of the @entity60 alliance which it leads and whose members also include @entity63 , airberlin and @entity64			0
members of the @entity59 , which includes @entity67 's @entity66 , @entity69 ’s @entity68 and @entity70 , is moving to @entity9 ’s new @entity71 next year and does not want to go elsewhere either			2
a spokesman said : ‘ this will allow us to effectively compete with the other alliances in @entity9 and add to the quality of our services , and therefore we do not see any opportunity for us to make a change to another airport			1
’ the @entity83 alliance which includes @entity84 , @entity85 of the @entity69 and @entity86 has also ruled out leaving @entity9 , the @entity81 reported			0
@entity87 , @entity83 's vicepresident of airport services said in a letter to the @entity91 commission , ‘ relocating to another @entity5 or @entity54 airport is not an option for our members			0
’ @entity5 mayor mr @entity3 has claimed the idea of @entity9 being the major hub @entity5 needed was ' crackers '			1
and environmentalists criticised proposals for @entity9 expansion , though bosses say bigger and cleaner planes and quieter and reducing car and vehicle pollution around the airport will make it better than at present			2
@entity109 , @entity9 ’s chief executive , said : ‘ after half a century of vigorous debate but little action , it is clear the @entity54 desperately needs a single hub airport with the capacity to provide the links to emerging economies which can boost @entity54 jobs , gdp and trade			1
‘ it is clear that the best solution for taxpayers , passengers and business is to build on the strength we already have at @entity9			0
‘ today we are showing how that vision can be achieved whilst keeping the impact on local resident to an absolute minimum			0
’ each of the options will mean compulsory purchase of some properties , and some property demolitions , while there might have to be major work done on the @entity138 to accommodate a new runway			0
there will also need to be a sixth terminal at @entity9 , with a new runway meaning the airport will be able to handle 130 million passengers a year rather than the current figure of 70 million			2
@entity9 executives said they did not think there would be a need for a fourth runway at @entity9 until at least 2040 .			0
