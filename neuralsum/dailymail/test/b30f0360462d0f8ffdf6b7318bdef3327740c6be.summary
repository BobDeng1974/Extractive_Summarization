a @entity1 - based writer who has grown tired of the battle between fat and skinny , is blaming plus - size retailer @entity4 for continuing to perpetuate the weight war — and has published candid photos of herself wearing the brand 's lingerie to illustrate the problem			1
in an essay published on @entity12 , @entity10 hit out at @entity4 ’s recent i ’m @entity14 lingerie campaign , which was widely perceived to have been a rather blatant critique of popular lingerie giant @entity17			0
the clothing store , which carries @entity19 sizes 14 to 28 , has been applauded for the new campaign , which shows plus - size models looking sexy in the brand 's lingerie			2
but while many people responded that it was encouraging to see women of different sizes being portrayed as sexy , offering a counterpoint to stick - thin models like @entity30 @entity29 , @entity31 , and @entity32 , @entity10 takes issue with its message			0
regular girl : writer @entity36 says @entity4 's new i 'm @entity14 ad campaign does n't show plus - size women of different proportions ' i do n't think it 's particularly healthy or progressive to pit fat bodies against thin bodies , ' she says			1
@entity10 explains that part of the problem is that @entity4 's ads do n't actually show women of all sizes , but rather a subset of overweight women who still have ' correct ' proportions , with flatter stomachs and larger busts			1
' i have never once seen a @entity4 customer with a body that is represented , even a little bit , in any of @entity4 's advertising campaigns , myself included , ' she said			2
so the self - described ' body - positive ' blogger has taken to social media , posting photos of herself in @entity4 underwear to her @entity62 account in a ' small offering of solidarity ' with other women of varying sizes who feel unrepresented in fashion ads. at size 18 , @entity10 admits , ' i 'm no model ' — but adds that her body type is also not so unusual			1
body positive : @entity10 hopes to promote positive body image and wants more retailers to advertise toward women of varying sizes no retouching : the @entity1 - based blogger posted photos of herself that showed off her figure and stretch marks she continues to say that she hopes brands like @entity4 will learn from women like her , as well as other plus - size women on social media , that customers want to see diverse models in their ads campaigns			1
@entity4 , however , insists its i 'm no @entity88 campaign is diverse and represents ' the woman who unapologetically celebrates herself '			0
' this campaign is intended to celebrate all women coming together to redefine the ideals of beauty , ' @entity4 representative @entity90 told @entity95			0
' this campaign message is all inclusive			0
our issue is not with certain sizes of women , it ’s with media ’s definition of ideal beauty ' but @entity10 believes it is not enough , saying : ' we do n't derive self - worth from seeing diverse images , but we do find power and solidarity and learn to appreciate our own individuality in relationship to others			2
' taking charge : @entity10 says she 's tired of being told to settle for plus - size fashion taking ' baby steps ' ' i ca n't imagine what the legions of other women , the ones who are strikingly different from these models , must feel , ' she adds			1
since publishing the photos of herself in lingerie , @entity10 has started sharing images of other plus - size women stripped down on her @entity62 as well in the hopes that an influx of images of diverse body types will help to spark change			1
' i 'm so tired of being told that i should be happy with # plussize fashion and representation taking " baby steps " , ' she wrote on @entity134			0
we should not be taking baby steps			0
we should be taking @entity137 * * woman steps			0

@entity10 , from @entity1 says she does n't campaigns which widen the *gap* between **‘** fat ’ and **‘** thin ’
she says plus - size store @entity4 's new ads celebrating women do n't actually show varying shapes , but rather ' correctly ' proportioned plus - size women
to show solidarity with other plus - size women , she posted photos of herself in @entity4 lingerie *online*
