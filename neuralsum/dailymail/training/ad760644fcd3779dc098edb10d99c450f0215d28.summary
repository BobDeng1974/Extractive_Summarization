the first legal challenge to the @entity2 's ban on same - sex marriage was launched today - months before the first gay wedding can take place			1
gay father @entity6 declared : ' i want to go into my church and marry my husband			2
' he added : ' the only way forward for us now is to make a challenge in the courts against the @entity2			2
' the legal move means an early test for @entity17 's promise to the @entity2 and @entity19 bishops that no church would be forced to conduct same - sex weddings against the will of its leaders and its faithful			1
@entity6 ( right ) @entity6 wants to be able to marry his civil - partner @entity26 ( left ) in a church ministers set down a ' quadruple lock ' in the new same sex marriage law - which received @entity32 last month - which is supposed to protect those churches which oppose gay marriage			1
however the guarantees will have to be tested in the courts and gay rights groups have been expecting to bring an early challenge			0
mr @entity6 and his civil partner @entity39 have been a celebrated couple since 1999 , when they became the first gay couple to be named on the birth certificate of a child			1
they now have five children through surrogate mothers			1
he said : ' we need to convince the church that it is the right thing for our community for them to recognise us as practising @entity53			0
@entity39 and @entity54 with their long - distance twins @entity55 and @entity58			1
they now have five children through surrogate mothers ' i am a @entity53 - a practising @entity53			1
my children have all been brought up as @entity53 and are part of the local parish church			0
' mr @entity6 , 42 , who owns a surrogacy company based near the family home in @entity67 and is opening another in @entity68 , added : ' if i was a @entity69 i could get married at the @entity70			0
@entity72 @entity71 can marry in the @entity73 - just not the @entity53			0
' it upsets me because i want it so much - a big lavish ceremony , the whole works			0
he said it was a shame that he and his partner were being forced to take @entity53 to court to get them to recognise them , but he said the new law did not give them what they have been campaigning for			2
mr @entity6 , who took out a civil partnership in 2006 , added : ' it is like someone giving me a sweetie with the wrapper on and telling me to suck it			0
' under the government 's same - sex marriage law , which is expected to lead the first gay wedding next summer , churches must legally opt in before they can conduct same - sex ceremonies			1
those that hold objections to gay marriage have been told the quadruple lock will prevent the courts from forcing them to stage gay weddings against the conscience of priests and most congregations.the lock says that no religious organisation could be compelled to marry same - sex couples or to permit this to happen on their premises			1
@entity114 holds his newborn daughter , @entity115 , at a hospital in @entity117 , @entity118 in 1999 it would be unlawful for ministers to marry same - sex couples unless their organisation 's governing body has opted into provisions for doing so			1
the @entity125 would be amended to ensure no discrimination claim could be brought against religious organisations for refusing to marry a same - sex couple			2
the new law also states that it no religious organisation could be compelled to marry same - sex couples or to permit this to happen on their premises			2
it would be unlawful for ministers to marry same - sex couples unless their organisation 's governing body has opted into provisions for doing so			1
the @entity125 would be amended to ensure no discrimination claim could be brought against religious organisations for refusing to marry a same - sex couple			2
the law also states that it is illegal for the @entity2 and the @entity142 to marry same - sex couples			1
the @entity2 is also protected by its own internal canon laws , which are part of the law of land , which say marriages must be between a man and a woman			0
however a succession of past court cases have resulted in defeats for @entity53 who were in disputes over equality laws , and in particular courts have always found in favour of gays who have challenged @entity53			0
under the government 's same - sex marriage law , which is expected to lead the first gay wedding next summer , churches must legally opt in before they can conduct same - sex ceremonies in recent years notable cases have ended in the sacking of a town hall registrar who refused to conduct civil partnership ceremonies , the sack for a @entity173 counsellor who said he would not give sex advice to gay couples , and defeat for a couple who declined to let a room in their hotel to a gay couple on the grounds that they were unmarried			1
@entity184 , of the @entity185 said : ' the ink 's not even dry on the @entity187 and churches are already facing litigation			0
we warned mr @entity17 this would happen , we told him he was making promises that he could n't possibly keep			0
' he did n't listen			0
he 's the one who has created this mess			0
mr @entity17 's chickens are coming home to roost and it will be ordinary people with a religious belief who yet again fall victim to the totalitarian forces of political correctness			2
' mr @entity184 added : ' we now face the real prospect of churches having to choose between stopping conducting weddings , or vicars , and priests defying the law and finding themselves languishing in the dock			0

@entity54 said that he wants to marry partner @entity39 in a church
said that the only way forward is to challenge the church in court
it is a test for @entity17 's promise to the @entity2 and @entity19 bishops
