scientists believe that all human life started in @entity2 six million years ago			1
but the evolutionary mystery of how monkeys arrived in @entity6 has baffled them for years , however , this mystery may finally have been solved			1
new fossil evidence collected by curators at the @entity11 of @entity12 , @entity8 suggests that the monkeys may have managed to journey across the @entity15 from @entity2 by sea			1
different species : @entity18 's ( @entity19 ) are seen on a tree on the banks of the @entity23 river , in @entity24 , @entity25 , at the gateway to the @entity27 discovery : the origins of just how @entity6 monkeys arrived in @entity6 , including these woolly monkeys in the @entity32 in @entity25 , may finally have been uncovered the revealing fossils were discovered along a riverbank in the east @entity35 @entity32 in 2010 near a notoriously challenging place for researchers to work			1
in 2012 , @entity38 , a curator at the museum took a closer look at the fossils and soon realized that they belonged to a primitive monkey similar to ones found in @entity2			1
he discovered that the fossils also showed that the monkeys arrived on the continent at least 36 million years ago			1
previous fossil records dated the monkey 's arrival back at just 26 million years			2
@entity38 told @entity51 : ' the @entity32 is a bit of a difficult place to work because there are no outcrops to speak of because they 're all covered by forest			2
' and so the only outcrops that one finds are along riverbanks , and that means that you can only look for fossils during the dry season , when the rivers are at their lowest point			0
' @entity38 said : ' one of the teeth [ we found ] is very , very similar to a fossil tooth from @entity2			1
' in paleontology , when the specimens that you have look very similar then that 's a general indication of comparable ancestry			0
' so the fact that these two teeth are very similar suggests - not prove , but suggests - that there might be a relationship between them			0
' evidence : new fossil evidence collected by curators at the @entity11 of @entity12 , pictured , suggests that the monkeys may have managed to journey across the @entity15 from @entity2 by sea according to researchers the types of fossils found in @entity6 show that it has always been home to many different animals			1
yet , just how monkeys arrived on the island nation has been shrouded in mystery			1
@entity38 said : ' the general hypothesis is that - first of all , these monkeys were very small			2
they 're about the size of a small squirrel with a long tail			0
' so they 're very small and as a consequence their food and water requirements would be much less than if they were very large			0
' so the general hypothesis is that there were monkeys on a river bank			0
during flood season , trees get swept into the river and carried out to the ocean			0
' as vegetation rafts , [ the trees are ] carried across on the @entity15 based on wind and current directions			2
' this remains a hypothesis - there 's no proof yet , although the similarities between the monkeys suggests that it did happen			0
' ' finding primates was a possibility , but they are very rare and very small			0
so in the end , it was a surprise			0

just how monkeys arrived in @entity6 has been *unknown* for years
@entity11 of @entity12 found revealing fossil evidence
it shows that the monkeys traveled across the @entity15 from @entity2 by sea
breakthrough evidence was located in the east @entity35 @entity32 in 2010
