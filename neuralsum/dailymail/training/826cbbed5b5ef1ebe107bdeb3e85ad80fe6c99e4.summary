@entity19 , 33 , chose to be a single mother to her second child ; she does not know the father of her daughter , who was conceived via artificial insemination			1
joy after sorrow : @entity19 with her baby daughter @entity26 she says that being a single mother is far less terrifying than having to co-parent with a man she met on @entity30 , a man who would eventually be charged with the murder of their child and who has now been charged with a further murder and is being investigated for a third			1
after the death of @entity12 , @entity19 's friends and family were concerned she was behaving irrationally out of grief , or trying to replace her beloved son by having another baby by herself			1
@entity19 told the @entity43 that she knew she could n’t stop being a mother , that she wanted another child - but the idea of dating again or leaving her child 's fate up to the authorities that so failed @entity12 filled her with horror			1
' though i have lived through one of the worst tragedies i can imagine , part of honoring my son is knowing that i must also continue to choose love and happiness , ' @entity19 wrote on her blog @entity59 after revealing the pregnancy			2
' my decision to have my daughter was one of the first steps i took on my personal journey			0
' @entity19 's daughter @entity26 was born october 30			1
the tiny girl is called a ' diva ' by her mother and is doing well			0
@entity70 has pleaded not guilty in the death of @entity12 , who authorities say @entity70 drowned on october 20 , 2012 in an attempt to cash in on three separate life insurance policies he had taken out on @entity12 's life amounting to $ 560,000			1
he has also been charged in the shooting death of his ex-girlfriend @entity79 , the mother of his first son , who died in 2003			2
according to the @entity43 , he mistakenly believed he was the beneficiary of a life insurance policy on her life also			0
@entity19 met @entity70 through @entity30 in february 2010			1
' i was approaching 30 and wondering if i would ever meet my soul - mate , or even if i had a soul - mate at all , ' she told the @entity43			0
@entity19 was initially put off by @entity70 ' scruffy appearance but was soon charmed			1
he took her to lunch , sang to her and told her how he had been left to raise his son after the death of the child 's mother in an accident			0
never forgotten : prince @entity19 died october 21 , 2012 , during a visit with his father @entity98 who has since been charged with his murder unsupervised : @entity101 was allowed visits without supervision with his son ( pictured , right , with @entity19 ) by a judge @entity19 would discover much later that in fact , @entity70 ' ex-girlfriend @entity106 had been shot in the face and that @entity70 himself was a prime suspect			1
@entity70 told @entity19 that after many bad dates , he was hoping to meet someone and settle down			1
he also claimed he owned a successful software consulting firm , and was an aspiring @entity113 ' n ' b singer who had interest from major labels			0
rams also shaved five years off his actual age			0
but @entity19 was taken in - he drove an expensive car , lived in a large home and never seemed to be short of money			2
@entity19 , who has a masters degree in special education and works as an intelligence analyst for a defense contractor , fell pregnant by accident and two months later @entity70 proposed to her			1
he and his pre-teen son had been drawn into the family by @entity19 , and though her mother was n't enamored of @entity70 , she did n't want to alienate her daughter , who seemed so happy and in love			1
@entity132 told the @entity43 that ' one always has to be careful about what one says about the person their child has fallen in love with			0
' @entity19 said that things began to go downhill after she became engaged to @entity70 and moved into his home			1
he complained about bills but he never seemed to work			0
his musical career was non-existent and he was charged after his son told a school counselor that his father hit him			2
the charges were eventually dismissed and @entity19 put it down to the boy being angry with his father and trying to get revenge			2
@entity150 cute : @entity19 dotes on her new baby daughter was born after the tragic death of her son , who @entity19 says dresses better than her ' i had grown up with a mother and father who had been married for longer than i was alive and who would stay married until the day one of them dies , ' she told the @entity43			1
' i hung on because i did n’t want to admit that this man was not the family man i had dreamed of			0
i guess i was afraid of losing that dream			0
i guess i was afraid of raising a baby myself			0
' when @entity12 was born in july 2011 , @entity19 was overjoyed			1
but two weeks later , her parents arrived on her doorstep with an unthinkable allegation : @entity70 had raped her 19 - year - old sister			1
charges against @entity70 in that case were dismissed but the @entity173 police department is reviewing its handling of the case			2
it was enough for @entity19			2
she fled the house with her son			0
it was only during the ensuing custody battle that @entity19 discovered @entity70 was a suspect in the death of @entity106			1
she also discovered he was literally not who he said he was : @entity70 changed his name from @entity186 in 2002			0
his only income was social security and the money he received in insurance after the death of his mother			0
the @entity43 reports that a prince @entity173 social worker noted after the death of @entity106 : ' this worker has never interviewed anyone like mr. @entity70			2
it is not known if mr. @entity70 ’ stories are real to him or if he is just attempting to impress , but he clearly does not exhibit normal behavior			0
' the @entity43 reports that @entity70 was a suspect in the death a decade ago - and yet he was still able to gain unsupervised visits with his son			1
he was indicted on murder and other charges in the case of @entity106 in november			0
@entity12 : @entity19 with her first - born , who died after an unsupervised visit with his father the final murder @entity70 is implicated in is that of his own mother , whose death by suffocation in a plastic bag was originally deemed suicide			1
the case has since been reopened			0
in a statement released in may , @entity70 denied killing prince : ' i did not harm my son			2
it breaks my heart to think that anyone would believe that i did			0
i ’m still shocked to learn how sick he was			0
' @entity19 is using her tragedy to try to change the system that she feels failed utterly to do its job : protect her baby son			1
she has spoken at a @entity229 briefing on ' @entity230 ' and writes extensively on the topic on her blog			0
@entity70 ' guilt or innocence has yet to be established by a court , but with a long list of suspicious behavior , including an arrest for beating his older son , an accusation of rape by @entity19 's own younger sister , lies about his age , producing pornography in his home and being a prime suspect in the shooting death of his former lover , that any court could allow unsupervised visits beggars belief			1
the @entity255 judfge @entity254 said there was no evidence , only implication of @entity70 ' illegal activity which was all ' a lot of smoke			0
' @entity19 was awarded sole custody of @entity12 , and @entity70 was given weekly supervised visits			1
but after a psychologist testified that @entity70 was fit to look after his child , he was allowed unsupervised visits			2
on the fourth visit , @entity12 died			2
according to the @entity43 , when the baby was brought into the hospital , staff notified @entity271 citing ' obvious unexplainable injuries			0
' an autopsy discovered ' small bruises and abrasions on the face and upper chest and back ' and ' fluid in the sinuses , airways , lungs and intestines			0
' he was found to have died by drowning			0
@entity19 's decision to have a baby as a single mother was made so that a judge will never have the power to make her hand over her child , against every maternal instinct that she has , to someone who might harm her .			2

@entity19 , 33 , gave birth to a daughter , @entity296 , in october
@entity19 conceived the child via sperm donor
last october , her *firstborn* child , 15 - month - old prince , died after a court - ordered unsupervised visit with his father @entity98 , 40
@entity70 has been charged with his murder
@entity19 has dedicated herself to campaigning for the *safety* of children of separated and *divorced* parents after authorities failed to protect @entity12
