by @entity0 review : a panel said today that the the suicide of @entity3 days after she gave evidence against her abuser ' could and should ' have been stopped the suicide of a violinist days after she testified against her ' predatory ' former choirmaster ' could and should ' have been prevented , an investigation into her death has found			1
@entity3 , 48 , was left ' utterly traumatised ' after giving evidence against @entity13 and his ex-wife @entity14 , and killed herself before they were convicted of a string of indecent assaults			1
@entity13 , who was later stripped of his obe , used his position to abuse ms @entity3 when she was 14 and 15 while at the prestigious @entity20 in @entity21			1
giving evidence mrs @entity3 told the jury : ‘ this feels like rape all over again ’ and complained her abuser had ' smirked ' at her across the room as she exposed him as a paedophile			1
a week later the virtuoso musician then killed herself at home in @entity31 , @entity32 , a serious case review said today ms @entity3 was ' let down ' by mental health services who failed to realise how vulnerable she was as she fought to bring @entity13 to justice			1
the @entity38 's report said : ' the panel considered that this was a suicide that could and should have been prevented			0
' mrs a had reasons to live and deserved support as a troubled teenager , and she most certainly deserved support again when , as a mature woman concerned for the safety of others , she stood up and faced her abusers in court			1
' the panel commend her bravery for taking a stand in this way			0
those services , who held responsibility for her care , were found wanting			0
' perhaps then , mrs a 's wish to protect other young people can belatedly become a reality			0
' abusers : @entity13 was jailed for six years last year and is ex-wife @entity14 was also jailed for indecent assault on @entity3 the trial heard the abuse took place in @entity13 's office and in his camper van , which he used to drive ms @entity3 out of the school grounds and force her to perform sex acts			1
at the age of 18 , his wife joined in the abuse , telling @entity3 that she ‘ owed her ’ as she indecently assaulted her			2
but he was cleared of raping her when she was 18 at his then home in @entity76 , @entity21			0
' traumatised ' : the violinist struggled to cope with appearing in court and how her integrity was questioned , saying it ' felt like rape all over again ' sentencing him , judge @entity82 labelled @entity13 ' a predatory sex offender ' and his trial heard sexual activity between teachers and pupils at @entity88 's was not uncommon			1
today 's serious case review said that music schools , along with other ' hothousing establishments ' , including ballet schools and drama courses , create a ' backdrop ' of ' very particular and potent form of grooming '			1
the report 's panel said staff acted at times ' with impunity '			0
the abuse ms @entity3 suffered only surfaced decades later when she confided to a friend at a dinner party in 2011			2
she contacted @entity105 and it led to an investigation by @entity107			0
the report said that the division of labour between the two forces created ' gaps ' and boundaries , across which information did not pass			0
during the trial was at risk of causing herself harm and her state of mind after giving evidence was ' down and fragile ' , the report said			1
she was given medication and treatment by her home treatment team ( @entity125 ) in @entity32			0
the report added : ' it seemed as if mrs a had stayed strong at her own emotional expense in order to maximise the chances of a conviction , but once she got home she declared herself ' utterly traumatised '			0
' the @entity125 did not specifically assess mrs a 's suicide risk during this time nor how to mitigate it , ' the report said			1
behind her facade , ms @entity3 hid ' turmoil and fragility ' and the @entity125 ' lost sight ' of how the court case outcome would influence whether she would overdose again			1
a mental health act assessment was not conducted and despite explicit statements to end her life , she was not considered to have passed the threshold for voluntary or compulsory in - patient treatment , the report went on			1
she then killed herself last 14 months ago			2
probe : more than 30 former female pupils of @entity20 ( pictured ) have reported abuse to police since @entity3 ' death @entity150 , assistant chief executive at @entity151 , said today : ' victims of sexual abuse should not feel forced to choose between their well - being and justice			2
' it is tragic that @entity3 felt she had to hide her mental health problems from a jury and subjected herself to cross-examination without the special measures that could have made the experience less distressing			1
' we believe there is an urgent need for an inquiry into how the criminal justice system treats victims of crime who have mental health issues , matching recent efforts to help offenders who have mental health issues			2
' detective chief superintendent @entity172 , head of @entity107 's public protection division , said : ' on behalf of the force , i would like to extend once more our sympathies to the family of @entity3			2
' her incredible bravery in facing her abusers in court and supporting a prosecution led to the conviction of @entity13 and @entity183 and it is tragic that she was not able to see justice served '			2
@entity105 said they accepted that ' more must be done ' to recognise the needs of vulnerable people in historic child abuse cases			0
@entity190 , head of public affairs for the @entity192 , said : ' despite being an adult when she gave evidence , @entity3 was still clearly a very vulnerable witness			2
' there is an urgent need to reform how vulnerable people are treated in court			0
many victims speak of the cross-examination being almost as bad as the original abuse ' a government spokesman said : ' this tragic case highlights how vital it is that victims have the best support possible to help them recover and seek justice , from the moment they report a crime until the end of a trial and beyond '			2
victims ' commissioner @entity214 , whose husband @entity216 was killed by a gang vandalising his car , said : ' mental health should never be a barrier to justice			1
' the tragic death of @entity3 has shown how crucial it is for all involved to truly understand and work together to protect vulnerable victims as soon as they enter the criminal justice system			0
' there are no words to describe how traumatic it is to re-live a harrowing crime by giving evidence in court			1
my three daughters had to go through it when their father was brutally murdered and they still live with it each day			0
' victims tell me things need to change			0
the @entity239 and pre-trial cross-examination are a welcome step but i want to see proper accountability in place to prevent further lives being lost in the future			0
