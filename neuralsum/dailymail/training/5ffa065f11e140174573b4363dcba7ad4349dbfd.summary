a couple of days after my first son was born , i remember watching him sleep			1
his parachute - silk eyelids dropped over his eyes			1
he was full from his last feed , his breathing scarcely more than a contented whisper			0
he looked so assuredly at peace with the world			0
there was a lump in my throat from the overwhelming love i felt for this new person who i had nurtured and protected inside me for nine months , and was now out in the world			1
as each week went by , i felt more and more attached to @entity16 as we formed an incredibly close @entity18 all that changed when the four - month - long paid maternity leave from my newspaper job came to an end			1
i loved my work , needed the money , and therefore did n't feel i had a choice over whether or not to go back			1
so i did what every mother at this difficult moment does : i found a good childminder and convinced myself my son would be fine			2
over the years @entity31 has felt the need to prove to @entity33 ( r ) that he is important to her and loved and was he fine ? physically , yes			1
emotionally , however , i 'm not so sure			2
in fact , i am convinced that the abrupt break in the bonding process between us had a profound and enduring effect , and may still be having an effect - even though he 's a now a 37 - year - old father himself			2
i am also convinced that because i never left my younger son , @entity44 , born four - and - a - half years later in 1980 , and was a constant presence throughout his childhood , he is the secure , loving and easy - going man he is today			1
i have found myself recalling those difficult , guilt - ridden days as a young working parent as debate rages about @entity51 's recent budget			2
a host of tax allowances that favour working over ' stay - at - home ' mothers has provoked fury , and i think rightly so			2
forcing mothers back to work when they do not feel their child is ready , is cruel and destructive for all concerned			1
what has become lost amid the political battle is what it means for a child to have their mother with them , rather than a stand - in who , however loving , can never understand and love them as much			2
while researching her book @entity31 realised it is vital for children to feel bonded to their caregiver when my maternity leave was up and i returned to work in february 1976 , @entity16 became clingy and fretful , crying anxiously if i so much as left the room			1
it did n't just happen when he was left with the childminder when i went to work ; at weekends it was the same when i was only moving from room to room			2
as he grew into a toddler , there were tantrums and fits of defiant anger that continued for years.during his school days , he would stamp around declaring he was ' rubbish '			1
other times he just seemed sad and withdrawn			0
leaving @entity16 was not , i now see , simply a matter of finding high - quality childcare			1
he was certainly well looked after - and is still in contact with his childminder			2
it was , i realise , a double whammy			0
not only did he lose me when i was at work , he also lost me , in a sense , when i was at home			2
you see , @entity16 did not have me , the person who had represented fundamental security since his birth , the person he relied on , to help him navigate this big , overwhelming and sometimes frightening new world			1
exhausted from my demanding newspaper job , i often arrived back home drained and frazzled and not up to empathetic parenting			2
at this point , my husband @entity105 was also working long and unpredictable hours in the film business			2
at the time , i did n't know much about the meaning of attachment			0
but writing about children 's psychological problems and researching for my book @entity113 , i came to understand it is vital for children to feel bonded to the person ultimately responsible for caring for them			0
if you do n't , as my personal experience shows , children can suffer for the rest of their lives			0
i believe it is crucial for a mother or a father , who has been very involved from the beginning , to provide a loving , secure and constant presence while babies navigate that first year			0
i started working from home as a freelance writer when @entity16 was two - and - a - half			1
i made the difficult decision to sacrifice my job to care for him , with help , at home because i had begun to fear that @entity16 's worrying behavioural traits were caused by my lack of time for him			1
but even though we began to spend more time together , he remained guarded and , as he became articulate , fiercely critical of me			0
it was as though the abrupt severing of the bond we had developed so early on continued to be an unconscious force			2
how different all this was with my second son			2
@entity44 , who was born four years after @entity16 , when i was already working from home			1
he slotted into a life where i was virtually a constant presence			0
yes , we had au pairs or helpers who came in during the day , but i could be around if needed and i broke from work at tea time to be with the boys until they went to bed			0
if necessary , i worked into the night to meet @entity155 believe the attachment @entity44 had with me - without a sudden break - gave him an entirely different quality of security			0
etched on my memory is a lovely image of him as a baby in his bouncy chair in the garden with me working contentedly alongside him			0
he was so at ease , and unlike @entity16 , not at all worried if i came or went			1
he was benignly accepting , secure and good natured			0
i can never recall feeling seriously concerned about him in the way i had with @entity16 during his childhood			1
@entity16 was far more often a worry			1
@entity44 's deep sense of security enabled him to become independent of me and @entity105 at his own pace , to develop sociability and the desire to be with other children , and be without me			0
he has always been trusting and emotionally open , whereas his brother is far less so , even to this day			0
@entity16 has always been cautious and secretive with us			1
i knew nothing of the relationships he might have had as a young man , and it was only when things were serious between them that he introduced his future wife			0
@entity44 on the other hand wrote ' i love @entity187 ' behind the bath when , aged six , he was infatuated with a girl at school			0
@entity31 pictured with @entity16 as a teenager ( far left ) , husband @entity105 and younger son @entity44 since then he has poured out tales of passions , sobbed on my shoulder at big break - ups and is demonstrably loving with his fiancee in front of us			1
most importantly , @entity44 has always seemed to trust that his world was a happy place and i know deep down that is because i did n't abandon him to get back to work too early in that precious first @entity203 i believe fervently that we must not penalise mothers who want to stay with their children until they judge they are ready to be left			1
thankfully , there is a happy ending to my story with @entity16			1
over the years i have felt the need to prove to him that he is important to me and unconditionally loved			1
as he has grown to adulthood , i have discussed this with him - apologised in fact - for what i believe was a traumatic event for a four - month - old to endure			1
he , of course , is unaware of any damage done			0
but the point about damaged attachment is that it is unconscious			0
even now he can suddenly become emotionally unsettled for no apparent reason			1
our relationship has grown much stronger and warmer over recent years			0
then , a couple of years ago when his wife was pregnant he asked if they might rent the first floor of our home because they would like to be near family			0
we all live together to this day			0
their daughter , @entity230 , is almost two and i watch my son , so involved with her , so close and loving , and when he said to me the other day how happy he is that she has a warm and affectionate relationship with me , i felt that finally i could relax			1
but it has been a long and painful journey , which is why i feel so strongly that the government must learn to value mothers who stay at home with their children			0
the job they do is invaluable			0
and lasts a lifetime .			0

@entity244 felt more and more attached to first son @entity16
went back to work when four - month - long paid maternity leave came to end
as a toddler he threw tantrums and fits of anger that continued for years
even now , as an adult , he can become emotionally unsettled for no reason
