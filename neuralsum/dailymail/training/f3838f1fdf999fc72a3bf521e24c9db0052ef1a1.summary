by @entity0 published : 04:32 est , 23 may 2013 updated : 07:02 est , 23 may 2013 the tricorder , a medical device that scan patients in seconds , originally shot to fame in @entity6 - but now a @entity8 firm has made it a reality			2
the @entity11 can measure your heart rate , temperature , blood oxygen levels , respiratory rate , blood pressure , @entity18 and emotional stress - just like @entity21 's handheld gadget			1
it can be placed on the user ’s forehead and within ten seconds uses @entity25 to send the results direct to their smartphone after an array of sensors and a camera scan the patient			1
now researchers have created a ' real ' version it is also able to store previous results meaning that patients can track changes in their vital signs			1
' the @entity11 puts your body ’s information where it belongs : in your hands , ' the firm says			1
' share it with your doctor and others to take health conversations – and discoveries – to a new level			2
' the app comes in @entity61 and @entity62 versions and will support @entity25 4.0			0
users will be able to share their data with friends and their doctor easily			0
the tricorder uses a @entity69 adapter that can be hooked into a usb port , and it takes less than an hour to charge the battery			1
when it is being used a few times every each , the battery lasts for about a week , the firm says			0
the @entity11 is currently in the prototype stage of development but the inventors are hoping to file it with the @entity79 ( @entity79 ) so that they can launch it to consumers			1
it can be placed on the user 's forehead and within ten seconds uses @entity25 to send the results direct to their smartphone in an attempt to gather the data needed to pitch the device to the @entity79 the inventors are calling for volunteers to offer to test it			1
their findings will be used to help modify the design			0
the team launched a site on crowdfunding site indiegogo to raise $ 200,000 for its development - and hit their target in two hours			2
' we are in awe at the enthusiasm the community has shown for the @entity11 since the prototype was first revealed six months ago			1
' we get calls and emails everyday from parents , researchers , students and body hackers anxious to be part of the first generation of consumers to truly understand their own health , ' said @entity113 and ceo @entity114			2
' we ’ve pushed the envelope , had some key breakthroughs , and are ready to share this next iteration of the product with consumers			2
' it is also able to store previous results meaning that patients can track changes in their vital signs using the app which comes in @entity61 or @entity62 versions the @entity11 was design by @entity11 , a start - up based at @entity129 in @entity130 , @entity8			1
the device is built on the 32 - bit @entity133 platform that @entity129 used for @entity134 at @entity135 ( @entity136 ) and the @entity137			0
the team is comprised of data scientists , mathematicians , coders , molecular biologists , mechanical and electrical engineers , and biophysicists			0
the @entity11 was design by @entity11 , a start - up based at @entity129 in @entity130 , @entity8			1
the team is made up of data scientists , mathematicians , coders , molecular biologists , engineers , and biophysicists the inventors said : ‘ the device will allow people to see the fingerprint of their health in very minute detail			0
‘ it allows people to connect with their physician in ways that were never possible before			0
‘ we will have , essentially , a doctor in the palm of our hands			0
‘ it is the ultimate consumer device for medicine			0

@entity11 can measure your heart rate , temperature , blood oxygen levels , respiratory rate , blood pressure , @entity18 and emotional stress levels
takes readings when placed against the forehead and sends to smartphone
can store previous readings so user can *monitor* changes in vital signs
is currently in prototype stage of development but designers hope to pitch it to the @entity79 so it can be sold to consumers
