@entity0 released a fourth promo video on thursday on the eve of @entity4 's sitdown interview with @entity5 airing in which he is expected to talk about his gender transition			1
the 30 - second clip opens with the 65 - year - old former decathlete greeting @entity5 at his home			0
@entity4 - the ex-husband of @entity11 matriarch @entity10 - appears somewhat anxious as he tells the @entity5 : ' it 's going to be an emotional rollercoaster , but somehow i 'm gon na get through it			1
' i ca n't let myself hurt them			0
they 're the only ones i 'm concerned with , ' the reality star says			0
the video then shoots to footage of @entity4 's older children ; @entity39 , 36 and @entity40 , 34 , ( from his marriage to @entity42 ) along with @entity43 , 33 , and @entity44 , 31 , ( from his marriage to @entity46 ) who all appear in the latest snippet from the show			1
another frame includes a photograph of him with daughter @entity51 , 19 , and @entity53 , 17 , along with his stepdaughters @entity11 , 36 , @entity55 , 34 , and @entity56			0
it ends with @entity4 looking to the future , and asking how his ' story ' will end			2
he says : ' i wan na know how this story ends , you know ? how does my story end ? ' looking to the future : the clip ends with @entity4 asking ' how does my story end ' @entity0 has kept a tight lid on friday 's much talked about broadcast , only releasing a couple of non specific quotes from @entity4			1
the network is not expected to reveal much more in advance of friday 's program , preferring to give him the opportunity to address the topic in the full context of the interview			1
@entity5 has not spoken to outside media about the interview , which was conducted in february — one day in @entity80 , another in @entity82			2
she 's scheduled to promote it on @entity0 properties on friday : @entity87 , @entity86 and @entity88			1
@entity90 executives also have n't spoken about it , not even confirming publicly until april 6 that the interview had taken place , until this friday 's airdate was set			1
tight lid : @entity0 has only released snippets with non-specific quotes from @entity4 , paving the way for his story to air in full on friday 's air date the tight lid enables @entity0 to avoid the touchy issue of potentially ' outing ' a public figure before the person has had a chance to publicly address the topic himself			1
not everyone is waiting : the @entity109 on wednesday published a front - page picture of a person they said was @entity113 wearing a dress			0
the approach has left his syndicated entertainment newsmagazines starved for news			0
@entity119 said they 've done stories on the three 15 - or 30 - second promos that @entity0 has released			1
the first @entity0 promo showed two @entity113 images — one from behind and the other from the side as he talked with @entity5 , his face obscured by shadows			2
in the second and third @entity113 is heard more clearly , and with two soundbites			0
' my whole life has been getting ready for this , ' he said			0
he also talks of the importance of not hurting his children			0
moral support : the 65 - year - old father - of - six appears alongside his four oldest children @entity39 , 36 , @entity40 , 34 , @entity43 , 33 , and @entity44 , 31 ; the latest clip reused this previously aired footage from another promo the interview was conducted before @entity113 was involved in an auto accident in which another motorist was killed			0
@entity0 is expected to address the topic , although the timing precludes it from being raised with @entity113			1
some of @entity113 's children , pictured in one of the promos , are also expected to be interviewed			2
@entity119 predicted big ratings for the special			0
@entity0 is airing it on a friday night , when tv - watching is usually low			1
two big interviews are among the top 100 most - watched telecasts of all time in the @entity157 : @entity159 's 1993 talk with @entity160 , seen in 36.6 million homes , and @entity163 ' 1999 interview with @entity164 , seen in 33.2 million homes			2
friday 's interview likely wo n't approach those numbers , but should certainly exceed the friday 20/20 average of 6.2 million viewers this season			1
@entity171 airs on @entity0 on friday 24 april at @entity172			2
not appearing in the interview : @entity55 , 34 , @entity56 , 30 , and @entity11 , 36 , as well as @entity51 , 19 , and @entity113 , 17 , are not scheduled to talk during the interview			0

@entity0 has kept a tight lid on *details* but interview is expected to address @entity4 's gender transition
@entity181 has only released non-specific quotes so as to allow @entity4 to address topic in full context of friday 's interview
