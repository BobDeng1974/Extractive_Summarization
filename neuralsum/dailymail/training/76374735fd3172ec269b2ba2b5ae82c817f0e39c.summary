by @entity0 you might think of cats and dogs as merely faithful companions			1
but a new book says we are starting to treat them more and more like humans			1
and it may affect our laws , not only legally but socially as well , in ways we had n’t imagined			2
mugshot : a new book claims that cats and dogs are being treated more and more like humans in the @entity17 , 90 % of pet - owners regard their animals as part of the family			1
and $ 60 billion ( £ 35 billion ) was spent on companion animals in the @entity17 alone in 2013			0
the implications of this are that owners are treating their pets just like they would another human			0
‘ people are shelling out money and risking their lives to save their pet , ’ @entity31 , author of @entity32 : our @entity33 tells @entity35			1
‘ you would n’t do that for a bird or a toaster			2
cats and dogs are getting this rarefied status in the home			1
' @entity31 , who also teaches science journalism at @entity45 , @entity46 , says that cats and dogs have achieved a status in @entity51 cultures that is unheard of for any other animal			1
they are being treated more like people in society and law , blurring the lines between animals and person			1
research has found dogs are the most popular pets for animals lovers			2
married men living in the countryside are most likely to own a dog			2
while single women in their twenties are most likely to own a cat			0
more than half of dog owners describe themselves as hardworking			0
whereas the majority of cat owners claim to be introverted and messy			0
‘ in some legal cases the best interests of the cat and dog are considered , ’ @entity31 continues			1
‘ and judges are awarding more emotional distress damages from killing cats and dogs			1
‘ in the past it used to be $ 50 ( £ 30 ) , now it ’s in the tens of thousands of dollars			0
‘ and during @entity85 , rescuers were saving pets as well as people			0
‘ it ’s a revolution not only in our homes , but in society and law			0
’ while the change in status of the animals may give rise to complications , it also has some benefits			0
not least , the animals now have greater protection than ever before			0
but this could have some far - reaching connotations			0
for example , @entity31 envisages a future where if a pet owner did n’t walk their dog enough , or it was n’t given proper medical treatment , an organisation could turn up and take it away like a child			1
‘ there are a lot of bizarre consequences , and perhaps if pets were regarded as people they could n’t be neutered			2
‘ so there ’s a really interesting precipice for where we decide to go next			0
’ doctor , doctor : treating pets more like people could make trips to the vet more complicated in ancient @entity129 cats were worshipped as gods and given ethereal status , but this is one of the first times in history that they have been given almost an equal footing to humans			1
according to @entity31 , some people are fighting for cats and dogs to be considered more like children			1
they could one day be allowed into restaurants , and apartments would not be allowed to have ‘ no pet ’ policies			0
but from the perspective of the cats and dogs themselves , we ’re not quite sure if they are starting to think like us yet			1
‘ from more than a dozen labs around the world studying dogs , we know they have a sense of morality , justice and jealously , ’ says @entity31			1
‘ we are discovering more going forwards			0
’ ‘ cats are harder to study , there has n’t been a lot of research into the feline mind			2
’ ‘ but as a cat owner myself , i hope we ’ll discover they ’re just as capable as dogs are			2

cats and dogs are treated more like people than ever before , says author
@entity31 *discusses* his findings in new book @entity32
he says we are starting to accept them as *quasi-citizens*
they are even being given greater social and legal status
it could lead to a future where cats and dogs are treated like children
for example , if a pet owner did n’t walk their dog enough , or it was n’t given proper medical treatment , an organisation could turn up and take it away
