by @entity0 published : 18:46 est , 4 january 2014 updated : 18:46 est , 4 january 2014 a controversial plan for @entity4 and @entity5 supporters to ‘ swap votes ’ to keep @entity7 out of no 10 and ensure @entity8 gets the chance to leave the @entity10 has been launched by writer and political campaigner @entity11			1
his ‘ @entity13 ’ scheme aims to stop @entity5 robbing the @entity15 of the @entity17 seats they need to defeat @entity18 in the next election			1
mr @entity11 claims it would give @entity5 leader @entity21 and a handful of his candidates a chance of winning seats			2
swap : @entity27 , left , could find it easier to retain @entity29 if @entity5 supporters agree to vote @entity4 in key seats			1
in return , conservative voters in other areas could support @entity5 , led by @entity21 ( right ) he plans to set up a website to enable @entity5 and @entity4 supporters in different constituencies to pledge to ‘ exchange votes ’			2
polling experts last night cast doubt on whether the scheme could work , given the @entity15 had more to gain than @entity5			1
but @entity4 - supporting mr @entity11 , who has won praise for setting up a free school in @entity44 , says he is determined to give it a try			0
he said : ‘ whatever their party allegiances , most people are in favour of a referendum on the @entity10			0
but the @entity4 - @entity5 split could let @entity7 into @entity29			0
and he ’s said that unless circumstances change he will not allow a vote on our future in @entity56			0
’ @entity57 , professor of politics at the @entity59 , said : ‘ such a scheme could only hope to make a significant difference to the composition of the next @entity63 if the election race were much closer than it is at present			0
‘ it could prove nigh impossible to find even a dozen seats in which sufficient @entity4 voters could be persuaded to switch to @entity5			1
consequently , the idea looks at risk of seeming to offer @entity5 too little			0

controversial scheme aims to stop @entity5 winning key @entity4 seats
in return @entity4 voters could help @entity5 take their first seats in the @entity17
but polling experts have doubted whether the scheme could work
