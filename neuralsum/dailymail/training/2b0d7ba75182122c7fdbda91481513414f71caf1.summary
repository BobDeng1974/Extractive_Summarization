by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity3 manager @entity2 believes @entity4 have been ' unlucky ' at the @entity5 and are favourites for tuesday 's clash			1
@entity2 's side have already qualified for the @entity5 last 16 having beaten @entity9 and @entity10 , while @entity12 's men lie bottom of @entity14 after defeats to the same opponents			1
yet @entity2 says his side will not be underestimating @entity4 and is expecting an aggressive and committed performance from @entity12 's side as they try to salvage pride			1
reason to cheer : @entity2 and his @entity3 side have shocked the world with wins over @entity10 and @entity9 looking glum : @entity12 has had little to cheer as @entity4 have already crashed out of the @entity5 @entity25 to make changes three and easy ? @entity3 boss @entity2 is hoping his side will be able to keep up winning ways switching it up : @entity30 takes a stint in goal as @entity3 train on monday ' it will be more complicated from here			1
our opponents have seen us ; they know us , what we have and what we do n’t have			1
we ’ve improved ' the mother of football can not leave without points and that makes it very complex			2
' it makes the match very hard			2
@entity4 must take some pride out of @entity47			1
they can not just leave with crossed arms			2
' this means it will be a head - to - head , a one - to - one match			2
those who come into the team will give their all and fight for their position			2
we want to be no.1 in the group and we deserve to be it			1
' it seems to be that maybe @entity4 were taken by surprise			1
they have n’t been lucky in finding the goal			0
they came to the box many times but did not score the goal			0
' above everything they will have pride			2
we will attack and have our own style of play			2
we will continue to do what we have done so far			0
plucky minnows : @entity3 have upset both @entity9 and @entity10 and now have @entity4 in their sights all over : @entity78 's strike for @entity9 put @entity4 on the verge of going out , before @entity3 sealed it clinical : @entity82 's failed clearance allowed @entity78 to bag the winner in @entity9 's 2 - 1 victory ' we are happy in @entity47			1
i believe @entity3 is n’t the favourite			1
@entity4 is favourite for many reasons			1
they have international players , the history , the jersey , many things			0
we are here in the fight , fighting to do things well			0
' we want to face @entity4 doing everything we have with an organised team tactically and if they want to win i think they can			1
otherwise let ’s see what happens			0
' @entity3 is a very organised country			1
we have been working since dec 8 on preparation			0
that has given us a tranquility			0
@entity3 is a country where everybody loves a football			1
' maybe we do n’t have the connotation of @entity4 , @entity110 , @entity47 , football , football , hooligans and so on but we love football , full stadiums in the qualifier sand indirectly it has forced this			1
everyone lived up to what they had to do			0
i have to do my job 100 % and i ’ve done it			0
i hope we can continue and do more			0
' @entity122 : @entity3 head boy : @entity30 scores for @entity3 against @entity10 to seal their place in the last 16 of the @entity5 nothing to shout about : @entity128 's first @entity4 @entity5 goal proved in vain @entity2 was left furious last week when seven of his players were drug tested after the @entity10 game and he has called on @entity134 to ensure other teams are tested just as thoroughly			1
he said : ' we feel there ’s a good faith from @entity134 and we thank them for the letter but we feel uncomfortable about it			0
public opinion ended up thinking : ‘ what do they fear ? ’ do it every day , go to the training sessions , do controls every day but do n’t give out the idea there is something being hidden			0
' the team will continue to run , we ’re very well prepared			0
test every team the same			0
i would like to see eight @entity47 players tested today , that the attitude is balance			0
we ’re not saying they should n’t do it but many felt they were doing this because they saw the players run			0
this group of players are crystalline pure , and that ’s it			2
