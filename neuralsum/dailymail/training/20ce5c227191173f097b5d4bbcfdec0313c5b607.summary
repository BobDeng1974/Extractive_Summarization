and his strike partner ? @entity18			2
the @entity26 man may well eclipse the @entity41 superstar as the no 1 footballer in the world next month			0
from above : the aliens challenged the world to a game of football , and @entity35 put together his best xi building the squad : while getting a tattoo , @entity51 striker @entity50 is approached by two men come with me : @entity55 and @entity10 midfielder @entity9 were clay pigeon shooting with footballs when they were told the news @entity17 ( captain ) - @entity69 - @entity68 @entity67 - @entity66 - @entity65 - @entity64 - @entity63 @entity62 - @entity10 @entity61 - @entity26 manager : @entity35 the former @entity73 star is the favourite to be named winner of the prestigious @entity77 award for the first time in his career , that would deny @entity17 a fifth consecutive crown			1

and he is reunited in the team with @entity23			2

and @entity138 loanee @entity8 muscles in too ( presumably because he is standing with the @entity140 )			0
