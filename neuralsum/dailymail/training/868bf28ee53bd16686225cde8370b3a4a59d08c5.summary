the @entity0 said on monday that it would veto a bill baring federal agencies from using their funds to implement president @entity5 's immigration actions if conservatives in @entity7 successfully pushed it through			1
the spokesperson for @entity0 had been hesitant in the past to say outright that @entity5 would veto such legislation if it were to pass , but with the proposal gaining steam , @entity0 press secretary @entity11 told reporters today that the president would send the bill back to @entity7 should it land on his desk			1
the veto threat comes as a group of conservative @entity0 members reviewed specific language they want inserted in an upcoming spending bill prohibiting the @entity23 from using any funds whatsoever to the distribution of work permits and green cards for the roughly five million illegal immigrants @entity5 has instructed the agency to stop deporting			1
conservatives in @entity7 are trying to block them from taking effect by placing restrictions on how relevant immigration agencies can use their funds a draft copy of the language , obtained exclusively by @entity43 , states that ' no part of any appropriation , ' including ' funds or fees collected or otherwise made available for expenditure , may be used by any agency to implement , administer , enforce or carry out any of the policy changes set forth ' in the president 's recent directives to @entity23			1
@entity53 in their opposition to the president 's unilateral decision to defer the deportation of up to five million illegal immigrants , staunch conservative lawmakers are pressuring @entity61 leadership to include the prohibitive language in a must - pass bill that would keep the government from shutting down next week			1
conservatives are charging ahead with the plan to restrict the spending of government agencies that handle immigration , specifically the distribution of green cards and work permits @entity5 has promised illegal migrants , even as @entity61 leaders continue to balk at the strategy and appropriators in the @entity0 claim it 's not possible			1
@entity61 @entity0 members will hold a closed - door meeting on tuesday during which both sides will have the opportunity to make their case to the entire caucus			1
the outcome of the intra-party battle will be a telling sign of how much influence the @entity89 wing of the @entity61 will have over the party 's agenda in the coming legislative session when republicans take full control over both chambers of @entity7 for the final two years of @entity5 's tenure in the @entity0			1
it will also show just how thirsty @entity61 are to reign in @entity5 's authority as chief executive of the country			2
if the @entity61 - led @entity0 and the @entity102 - controlled @entity101 are unable to come to an agreement on appropriations legislation by dec. 11 - the day before lawmakers are scheduled to leave town until early next year - non-essential government services will go dark until new spending legislation is passed			1
while senate majority leader @entity111 has accused @entity61 legislators trying to use the critical appropriations bill of ' holding our government hostage , ' conservatives on the @entity110 say they do n't believe it will come down to a shutdown			1
faced with the possibility of a second stoppage in normal government functions in less than two years , they believe @entity121 will cave under pressure and allow their bill to come to the floor , setting up a separate confrontation with the @entity0			0
still under discussion is whether the language would be part of a standalone bill to fund @entity23 that is separate from an omnibus bill funding the rest of the government through at least the first month of next year , allowing other government agencies to continue operating if the measure is unsuccessful , or whether the @entity61 will go all or nothing and include it in the main legislation to keep the government open			2
the draft obtained by @entity43 and confirmed by multiple @entity61 sources on the @entity141 does not detail the legislative strategy and a source familiar with the proposal confirmed to @entity43 that it 's still up for debate			2
among the actions taken by the president targeted in the draft are his memorandums changing the ' policies for the apprehension , @entity152 and @entity153 ' and those that give @entity23 secretary @entity154 the prosecutorial discretion to defer deportation of migrants residing in the country illegally who came to the @entity159 as children before jan. 1 , 2010			0
it would also block @entity23 from issuing work permits to illegal immigrants who have been living in the @entity159 since that date and have @entity159 - born children and prevent it from handing out additional permits to high - skilled workers			0
if the immigration specific language were set aside in a stand alone bill and @entity101 @entity121 refused to bring it to the floor after it 's all but assured passage in the @entity0 , only @entity23 would be affected by the partial shutdown a @entity61 congressional source told @entity43 recently			1
even then , essential services in the department , including border security , would go untouched			0
' @entity7 can not hand the president a blank check for his continued lawlessness , ' @entity183 , the communications director of influential conservative grassroots group @entity184 told @entity43 in an email			0
' the @entity61 - controlled @entity0 should use the upcoming funding bill to block @entity5 ’s plan to give amnesty , work permits and @entity191 numbers to those who are in the country illegally			2
' a demonstrator who disagrees with @entity5 's immigration policies stands outside @entity196 in @entity197 , @entity198 on nov. 21 during an event in which the president delivered remarks on his executive actions members of the @entity204 recently issued a statement saying that a key immigration agency the bill is designed to keep from enforcing @entity5 's memorandum is not subject to congressional oversight of its funds because it receives much of its money from application fees			1
however , the non-partisan @entity214 , a government - funded fact - finding organization that works for @entity7 , debunked that claim in a letter last week to a senator who strongly favors the conservative approach			0
' the funds available to the agency through fee collections would be subject to the same potential restrictions imposed by @entity7 on the use of its appropriations as any other type of appropriated funds , ' it said , breathing new life into conservative legislators ' plot			2
though @entity61 account for a majority of the members in the @entity0 , they have just 45 seats in the @entity101 and would need to convince at least 15 @entity102 and @entity236 lawmakers to join their cause in order to have a filibuster - proof majority			0
a handful of @entity102 senators have publicly shown their displeasure with the president over his decision to go it alone on immigration but whether they would vote to tie their party leaders hands is less clear			0
if they did and @entity5 did refuse to sign the legislation , leading to a government shut down , that would be president 's fault , not lawmakers ' , conservatives on @entity255 have vehemently argued			2
' president @entity5 will no doubt threaten a shutdown — that seems to be the one card he repeatedly plays , ' @entity258 sen. @entity257 said in a recent op - ed in @entity263 outlining the @entity61 strategy to defund the president 's immigration actions			1
' if the president is unwilling to accept funding for , say , the @entity23 without his being able to unilaterally defy the law , he alone will be responsible for the consequences , ' @entity257 wrote			0
@entity257 , a presumed 2016 presidential candidate , notably led the charge last fall to gut the president 's signature law , @entity273			0
when @entity121 refused to vote for legislation starving the health care law of its funding , the government shut down for more than two weeks beginning on oct. 1 , the first day of the 2014 fiscal year			0
it was not until the evening of oct. 16 that @entity61 in the @entity0 and @entity101 approved a continuing resolution allowing the government to reopen			0
the @entity0 said monday that it does n't believe that a majority of lawmakers would again be willing to shut down the government			0
pointing to previous statements from @entity101 minority leader @entity287 that a shutdown is not in the works , @entity5 spokesman @entity11 said today that it sends a ' pretty clear ' message when one of ' the most influential @entity61 in @entity7 ' says it 's not going to happen			2
the @entity0 , he told reporters on monday afternoon , continues to stand by its position that @entity7 should pass a yearlong appropriations bill			1
' what we would like to see is something that would sort of eliminate any kind of uncertainty , ' he said , adding that @entity7 should pass an omnibus spending bill that would fund all areas of the government			0
' we 're not asking them to do anything heroic , we 're asking them to do their job , ' @entity11 stated .			0
