by @entity0 @entity1 is a cheeky , happy , little goat , who loves attention			0
and the baby goat is certainly getting a lot of it , as he learns to walk with the help of a customised wheelchair			1
@entity1 , who is just over one - week old , was brought to @entity11 , a not - for profit sanctuary for rescued farm animals outside of @entity14 , on tuesday			1
the little pig is now one - month - old and is mostly recovered he was covered in lice , severely dehydrated and had lost the use of his back legs , due to an infection he contracted through his umbilical cord			1
@entity36 , founder and director of @entity11 , said that after a few days at the sanctuary being treated with antibiotics and painkillers , the little goat had improved so much that he began getting frustrated and trying to run around and play			2
@entity1 was fitted with a wheelchair , which allows him to run around using his forelegs until he recovers the use of his legs , which should happen as the infection leaves his system			2
the wheelchair was originally made for a baby pig named @entity24 , now one month old , who was injured when his mother sat on him , crushing his hind legs			1
the little pig , whom ms @entity36 says has ' so much spunk ' , has recovered enough that he was able to donate his wheelchair to his friend , @entity1 , though ms @entity36 says that @entity24 is definitely ' too fast for @entity1 to keep up with him			2
' @entity1 was brought to @entity11 , which was founded by @entity36 in 2003 , as a place for rescued farm animals to be cared for @entity1 will use the wheelchair until the infection has passed and he regains the use of his legs @entity24 and @entity1 are close friends , though ms @entity36 says that the ' spunky ' pig is too fast and the injured goat has trouble keeping up with him the little goat is one of 350 animals currently cared for on the sanctuary , which as well as pigs and goats is home to cows , alpacas , deer , sheep , chicken , geese , duck , rabbits , guinea pigs , peacocks , and horses			1
@entity11 was started by @entity82 after she rescued her first pig , @entity84 , in 2003 and realised that injured farm animals did not have the same help as native animals or pets			1
' i was involved in fostering cats and dogs and rehabilitating native animals , and a lot of organisations do that and a lot of individuals do that , but they forget about farm animals , ' she said			2
' just because they look different to cats and dogs , they 're still animals			0
' sometimes the animals are brought to the sanctuary by members of the public , as was the case when locals found an injured two - day - old goat on tuesday that they suspected had fallen off the back of a truck			0
@entity82 says that the little goat , who is just over a week old , thinks of her as its mother and will cry out if she leaves his sight the wheelchair was initially used by @entity24 , a baby pig whose mother sat on him crushing his hind legs @entity121 , as she was named , now lives at the sanctuary is @entity124 's favourite playmate			1
in other cases , the animals are rescued from imminent death , such as @entity128 , the miniature horse who was ' not miniature enough ' and so was going to be sent to the knackery due to his size			0
' luckily someone intervened and he came to us			0
' every animal at the sanctuary has a story to tell			0
all of them have different stories of some kind act that got them to the sanctuary , ' said ms @entity82			0
' these stories are really lovely			0
it shows the goodness of the human heart , because people see an animal in pain and they want to help , they do n't like to see another animal suffer			0
' the little piglet is now one - month old and has recovered enough to get around without the wheelchair @entity82 described @entity24 as a ' spunky ' little pig , who is now running about @entity11 and playing with other animals			1

baby goat contracted an infection in his hind legs through umbilical cord
has *borrowed* a wheelchair from his pig friend @entity24 to get around
