@entity0 had worked hard at turning this into a revenge mission , with an over-active social media campaign accompanied by the hash - tag slogan : ' a different story '			1
it was the sort of behaviour clubs usually shirk away from in fear of tempting fate			0
' revenge is a dish best served one year later , ' read one pithy message from the official @entity14 account , along with images of @entity0 scarves on a waxwork model of the @entity18 and a statue of @entity20			2
this constant search for something new is what makes the world wide web go around , but what exactly had they hoped to change ? @entity27 pushes @entity28 during the second - half of a bad - tempered last 16 encounter @entity28 and @entity31 look shocked as tempers begin to flare at the @entity33 @entity27 collides with @entity34 during a bad - tempered game with no love lost between the two sides last year , @entity31 ’s side won 3 - 1 in the first leg and few who witnessed that game expected @entity41 to recover against this emerging new force in @entity44 football			1
at times , it seemed to be very much the same old story			0
the @entity49 took the lead but were unable to kick on and @entity0 responded with great energy and desire , only to find this time , for all their pressure and clear opportunities , they could not establish a first - leg lead			1
the @entity57 champions still pose a threat at @entity59 next month , but @entity60 will have been perfectly content as he hopped back across the channel with his away goal and scores level after a game he could easily have lost			2
ultimately , the story was different in an important detail			0
@entity41 are stronger than last year and they resisted , with a bit of luck , the extra midfield muscle of @entity70 and the authority of @entity72 , who returned to replace @entity73 and confirm his status as no 1			1
@entity72 was brilliantly composed and focused and made a splendid save from @entity75 in the final seconds			0
@entity28 attributed the 1 - 1 result to the goalkeeper , as teams often do when they are wasteful in front of goal			1
@entity72 was in impressive form and kept @entity0 at bay with a string of fine saves @entity27 takes on @entity0 right back @entity87 as he returned from a three - match suspension @entity89 hit the opener in the first - half to give @entity41 a precious away goal although rusty , @entity27 proved an effective weapon for @entity41 , putting a @entity95 - like performance @entity96 worked hard in midfield and there was , of course , @entity27 , returning up front , the £ 32million , 17 - goal top - scorer , fresh from three weeks out , serving a hotly - disputed ban for violent conduct			1
fabregas , who had been suffering from a cold and arrived at the ground wrapped up in woollens , ran miles but found it difficult to influence the game and @entity27 was off the pace , as @entity60 said he might be			1
there was zip in @entity27 ’s legs ; his touch was heavy and , as @entity41 were stretched defensively in the second - half there were repercussions for the man up front			1
@entity27 became more remote , with his role increasingly limited to irritating those in blue , helping out in defence at set - pieces and trying to stay alert for any scraps that came his way ; the sort of performance delivered so many times by @entity95			1
for @entity60 , however , regardless of his contribution on the ball , it was important to have him on field , a symbol of the fighting qualities this team boast , proving this squad is stronger and more capable of going all the way			2
if anyone expected @entity27 to keep clear of physical contact they do not know his style			1
@entity27 may have been caught on camera and banned for his stamp on @entity145 , but he was not about to surrender his chief asset			2
@entity60 appeals for calm on the pitch immediately following @entity41 's opening goal the @entity150 were pegged back after @entity151 levelled with a thunderous headed effort there was a sequence of minor fouls as he set out to make a nuisance of himself			1
he was late into challenges on @entity34 talked his way into a row which had nothing to do with him and pulled @entity28 ’s hair			0
when @entity60 bemoaned his lack of strikers after losing in @entity168 last season , there was more to it than goals			0
he also lacked the hardy front man , to carry the team forward when they needed a break			0
@entity41 have got rid of five strikers since they were last in the @entity57 capital , including @entity177 , the winger who played up front in this fixture			2
three have arrived but , not for the first time , it was @entity41 ’s defenders scoring the big goals			0
@entity27 battles to win possession from @entity186 der @entity87 and @entity187 @entity27 has not found the target in the @entity189 since april when he scored for @entity190 at @entity41			1
the away goal is vital , and they have learned to appreciate its value over the years			0
it gave them hope in the epic fight - back against @entity199 , three years ago , and when they overturned the first - leg deficit against @entity0 last year			2
and , no matter how little adventure they show , it is not often @entity60 ’s team fail to find the net			2
the only time this season was back in november , in @entity208			0
it is a valuable asset in @entity44 and @entity41 are seasoned campaigners these days			0
@entity0 are acquiring these skills			0
they may be learning , too , that to change the script it is more important to stop conceding goals at home than to stir up mischief and antagonise the opposition .			0

@entity27 returned up front , fresh from three weeks out , as @entity41 drew 1 - 1 with @entity0
@entity27 was off the pace , as @entity60 said he might be , but still influenced the game with his *trademark* physical contact
@entity27 looked to win throw - ins and *corners* and help his team up the pitch and relieve some of the pressure as @entity0 *dominated* the opening phase
he helped out in defence at set - pieces and tried to stay alert for any scraps ; the sort of performance delivered so many times by @entity95
