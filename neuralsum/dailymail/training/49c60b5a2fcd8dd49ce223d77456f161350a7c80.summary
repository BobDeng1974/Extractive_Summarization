these extraordinary pictures give a glimpse into a beautiful underground landscape , the eerie remains of a once - bustling mine in @entity5			1
the @entity7 silica mine , at the head of the @entity9 in @entity10 , was once a prominent source of silica – a heat - resistant material that was used to line industrial kilns and furnaces			1
but the mine was abandoned in in 1964 , and is now surrounded by danger signs warning off all but the most experienced cavers			2
@entity20 , a professional photographer and keen caver , uncovered the amazing lakes and silica formations in an abandoned @entity5 the images show rusted mining equipment in the eerie caverns and tunnels and now , decades later , photographer @entity20 , 49 , has captured the caves ' stunning natural beauty mingled with the rusting relics of the their industrial past			1
the mine , which was first opened in the 18th century , is now unstable in places , and mostly filled with water , adding a new dimension to the underground landscape			2
the images show the beautiful variety of coloured stones and tranquil clarity of underwater lakes left dormant miles under the surface			0
mrs @entity20 and her fellow climbers had to brave total darkness to reach the silica formations the cave complex is now largely filled with water , which makes it dangerous to traverse , but also adds a new dimension to the beautiful rock formations			1
@entity20 , 49 , spent days crawling through the pitch black tunnels exploring and documenting the mine , most of which is completely underwater			1
she said : ' we worked in total darkness , the only light available is from our headlamps and sometimes we take hand torches too			0
' when we first entered the cave , we sat on the ground and switched off all of our lights for a few minutes			2
' this gives our eyes time to adjust to the darkness			0
it 's really relaxing to experience true darkness , something we rarely do in our modern lit world , and sit and listen to the sounds of the cave , which can be an occasional drip of water falling from the roof , water trickling down the wall , a waterfall or the sound of a raging underground river or just our own breathing			0
only expert cavers are permitted to enter the @entity9 cave complex , which is surrounded by danger signs exploring the centuries - old caves can involve crossing treacherous gaps , while relying on a head - torch as the only available source of light when we turn our lights on again they seem incredibly bright and we can see so much more of the cave than we could before			1
silica mining was very popular in the late eighteenth century and in the mid 1960s			0
the material is used to create ' fire bricks ' which were used in the construction of kilns and furnaces for the copper , steel and iron industries			0
the abandoned mine is surrounded by signs warning off inexperience explorers the caves , below the picturesque scenery of @entity105 , @entity10 , are now mostly underwater and extremely difficult to explore @entity20 added : ' i was struck by the beauty of the rock in the silica mine , the bright varied colours within it and the enormous stone pillars that the miners had created to hold the roof up			1
' a significant part of the mine is underwater , as a photographer i love this , because of the clarity of the water and reflections			0
' i was also intrigued by the remains of the mining equipment , the railway tracks that disappear down steep passages or go round a bend then suddenly stop , the up - turned carts that would have been used to haul the silica out of the mine			1
' it 's a tantalising glimpse into of a very different and industrial past that has long disappeared			0
' with over a decade of caving experience , @entity20 has had to navigate difficult and risky climbs as well as leaping over huge gaps in the dark to reach her goal			1
the silica walls of the @entity7 mine may be beautiful – but for centuries they also served a vital industrial purpose			1
silica – a form of silicon dioxide – is very heat - resistant and was used to line industrial containers such as furnaces and converters , which were used to smelt the pure metals which were at the heart of @entity152 ’s industrial revolution , which began in the 18th century			2
the silica formations in this mine were especially sought - after because of their great purity – which is close to 100 per cent			2
this purity , combined with the geological forces which shaped the caves over thousands of years , has led to the vivid and colourful formations which can be seen in the images above			0
as heavy industry waned in post-war @entity152 , the need to robust materials such as silica also dwindled , leading to mines such as this one being closed for good			0
although silica can be converted to silicon – the material used to create the tiny circuits which power computers – the mines had closed before global demand for pure silicon took off , and it is now mostly manufactured in @entity174 .			0

@entity20 , 49 , took the photographs on a caving *expedition* to the @entity7 silica mine in @entity10
the experienced caver traversed the dangerous , pitch - black cave complex to take the pictures
