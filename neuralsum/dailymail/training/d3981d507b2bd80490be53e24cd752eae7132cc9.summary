prosecutors also claimed that @entity7 , who was shot dead when police stormed the @entity55 cafe in @entity2 's @entity56 last tuesday to end a 16 - hour siege , was the ' driving force ' in his marriage with @entity0 - who , as a ' plump ' woman with ' olive skin ' , is ' extremely closely aligned ' with the physical description of ms @entity14 's killer			1
