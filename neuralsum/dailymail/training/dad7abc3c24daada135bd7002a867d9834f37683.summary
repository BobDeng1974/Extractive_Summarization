by @entity0 published : 11:31 est , 24 may 2013 updated : 11:37 est , 24 may 2013 researchers and archivists from @entity3 are asking for help in transcribing field notes and identifying insect specimens dating back over 100 years			1
among the collection is a @entity9 beetle discovered in 1833 by @entity10			0
volunteers can look at the specimens and submit their transcriptions online using the @entity17 university 's @entity15 system			1
citizen scientists will be able transcribe labels similar to the one pictured , which shows a ground beetle from @entity9 , @entity22 that was collected in 1833 by @entity10			1
volunteers can look through the other collections from @entity17 's @entity24 and submit transcriptions using its @entity27 system @entity15 is an online project that hopes to digitise arthropod specimen records from @entity31			1
the team behind the project plan to use these records to examine impacts of climate change and habitat modification			0
the project is a collaboration between eight entomological collections in @entity31			0
as part of @entity15 , citizen scientists can submit their analsyis of specimens on the @entity45			1
@entity45 is a web portal owned and operated by the @entity47			0
it was developed from the original @entity50 project and now runs more than a dozen projects that let volunteers take part in scientific research			0
as of 30 january 2013 , the @entity45 community consisted of more than 785,000 volunteers , gaining on average 500 - 1,000 daily registrations			0
the volunteers are often collectively referred to as ' @entity58 '			0
@entity59 teamed up with two other natural history collections – one focused on plants and the other on birds – to create @entity45 , a citizen science project that draws on the public to tame the voluminous records stored in drawers , jars and bookshelves in natural history museums throughout the world			2
@entity15 co-investigator @entity72 , associate professor of environmental , @entity73 at the university said : ' what really turns people on is knowing that they are contributing to science in a meaningful way			1
' these citizen science projects speak to the importance of public engagement in science			2
' ' without the help of citizen scientists , processing the sheer volume of records held in natural history collections — estimated to be well over 2 billion worldwide — would take generations , ' added @entity89 , director of the @entity24 and principal investigator of the @entity15 project			1
notes from @entity93 is among the many projects in the @entity45 - a web - portal where citizens can help answer a diverse range of scientific questions , such as how stars form , what whale calls mean , and what life was like in the ancient @entity104 town of @entity105			2
@entity106 , director of citizen science at the @entity108 in @entity109 and the technical lead for @entity45 said : ' our projects help answer research questions that can only be solved by a significant amount of human attention — they require people , not computers			2
' ' people have responded in a way that is truly great			0
there is an appetite for contributing to something real			0
' @entity17 graduate student @entity123 holds a display of specimens at the @entity126			1
there are around 6.5 million specimens in @entity31 's eight major entomological collections that need digitising as part of the @entity45 project in addition to insects , @entity45 participants can help digitize plant records from the @entity136 ( @entity137 )			1
the @entity137 collections include thousands of specimen images , labels and ledgers from hundreds of herbaria in the @entity143			2
the @entity15 project originally began with support from a 2010 @entity147 grant to digitize the first million — out of 6.5 million total — specimens from @entity31 ’s eight major entomological collections			1
as well as @entity17 , @entity15 includes insect collections from the @entity152 , @entity153 , @entity154 , @entity155 , the @entity156 , @entity157 , @entity158 and the @entity159			1
among the collection of specimens that need cataloguing at @entity17 's @entity126 is a ground beetle found by naturalist @entity10 , pictured , in 1833 ' @entity31 has a rich history of insect collecting dating back to around 1900 and earlier , ' said @entity89 , a professor in @entity17 ’s @entity165			1
' through @entity15 , our goal is to make at least some of those records , which are normally inaccessible to the public , available to people around the world			2
and by converting those labels into electronic records , it will be possible for us to track any changes in range for different species , and that provides insight into how animals react to changes in the environment			0
' questions have been asked about the level of accuracy of the transcriptions entered by the citizen scientists			1
researchers from the @entity188 are working with @entity45 to evaluate the cost , accuracy and speed of volunteer transcriptions from the @entity45 site			0
the site launched in beta in late april			0
the first 20,000 images , which included an insects like bombardier beetles and skipper butterflies			0
about a third of these records have already been transcribed by more than 2,000 users .			0

*handwritten* field notes and insect specimens dating back hundreds of years need to be catalogued at @entity17 's @entity24 of @entity205
citizen scientists can log onto the @entity17 university 's online @entity15 system to see the specimens and *suggest* ideas
