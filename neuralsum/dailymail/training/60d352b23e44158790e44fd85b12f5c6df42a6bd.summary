by @entity0 published : 04:36 est , 23 september 2013 updated : 09:38 est , 23 september 2013 a little girl who was nearly suffocated by a birthmark is now beaming after surgeons rebuilt her disfigured nose			1
despite being born prematurely at 27 - weeks , @entity5 was a healthy baby and progressed well while in hospital			1
but within days , a small red mark across the bridge of her nose - thought to be as a result of an oxygen mask being too tight - developed into a huge , purple , blister which started to suffocate @entity15 diagnosed a haemangioma , a birthmark caused by a benign tumour of the blood vessels in the skin			1
@entity5 ( pictured , left , at six - months - old and , right , now ) had a haemangioma - a birthmark caused by a benign tumour of the blood vessels in the skin			1
it was so large that it made it impossible for her to breathe normally it can grow rapidly and in severe cases , such as @entity5 ’s , it can block the airways			1
in a race against time , doctors at @entity30 in @entity31 had to fit a tracheostomy tube when @entity5 was just eight - weeks - old to stop her suffocating			1
since then , she has been on a long journey and now , at the age of nine , is all smiles again after surgeons reconstructed her nose using cartilage from her ear			0
her mother , @entity42 , 36 , from @entity43 in @entity44 , said : ‘ @entity5 is so happy with it now			2
she is delighted with her new nose			0
’ @entity5 ’s birthmark attracted cruel comments and stares until she had her first operation to remove the majority of it when she was four			1
mrs @entity5 , a legal secretary , said : ‘ we went ahead with the operation because we wanted her to look a bit “ normal ”			2
going out every day and having people staring at you is not nice so we did it for her appearance			0
@entity5 ( pictured at two - weeks - old ) was born prematurely at just 27 - weeks			1
she had a red mark on her nose which was thought to have been caused by an oxygen mask the mark grew quickly damaging @entity5 's nose and putting her at risk of suffocation			1
her parents say it was lucky that she was premature as it meant she was already in hospital when the growth started to affect her breathing			0
@entity5 us pictured at five - weeks - old ‘ we have always been open with her about it			1
we told her that is her birthmark , her special nose			2
she got more aware of people staring as she has got older			0
’ @entity5 also risked losing her eyesight as the tumour had got bigger and bigger and eventually took over her whole nose when she was just seven - weeks - old			1
doctors put her on steroids in an attempt to shrink the growth but when that did n’t work @entity5 , she started a 12 - month course of chemotherapy in a bid to zap the tumour			1
when @entity5 was just eight - weeks - old she had to be fitted with a tracheostomy tube to enable her to breathe			1
she is pictured at seven - months - old @entity5 was put on steroids but they failed to shrink the growth so she had a 12 - month course of chemotherapy as well as surgery to remove most of the growth			1
she is pictured at 12 - months - old recalling the ordeal , her mother said : ‘ it was getting bigger and bigger and growing over the bridge of her nose , obscuring her eyes so rather than having round , football shaped eyes they were becoming shaped like a rugby ball from where the tumour was damaging them			1
‘ when they first said it was a birthmark i just thought it would be a little red mark			1
i ’d never heard of them being raised tumours and had no idea they can do so much damage			0
‘ it was very daunting and stressful			0
it was constant hospital appointments in the first year so it was quite intense			0
’ the tracheostomy was removed when @entity5 was 18 - months - old but her nose remained disfigured so she had to have further surgery to rebuild it			1
she is pictured at the age of two in july this year surgeons at @entity30 in @entity31 operated to rebuild her nose			2
she said she is very happy with her new nose it was only once the tumour had shrunk enough that @entity5 was able to breathe unaided and the tracheostomy tube was removed after 18 - months			1
but her nose was left disfigured and so mrs @entity5 and her husband @entity137 , 36 , consulted plastic surgeons at @entity30 , who were able to re-build her nose			2
mrs @entity5 , who also has a 12 - year - old son , continued : ‘ the damage it could have caused if it was not spotted straight away could have been fatal - it could have suffocated her			1
@entity5 said : ' i think my new nose looks lovely now			2
i think my surgeon is very clever			0
i am very happy now ' @entity5 's mother , @entity42 , said : ' we went ahead with the operation because we wanted her to look a bit " normal "			2
going out every day and having people staring at you is not nice so we did it for her appearance ' ‘ we were really lucky that she was born so prematurely in a way as we were already in the hospital when it was spotted so we were referred straight away			2
‘ the last operation was quite painful for her			0
she has got on so well			0
‘ she might have to have more surgery later on but not until she is about 16			0
’ mrs @entity5 said : ' @entity5 is so happy with it now			2
she is delighted with her new nose			0
it is amazing ' @entity5 will probably need more surgery when she is 16			2
she is pictured with her mother @entity42 , father @entity137 , and brother @entity165 , 12 @entity5 said : ‘ people used to upset me when they stared at me and called me names			2
now i am delighted that i had my operation			0
‘ i think my new nose looks lovely now			0
i think my surgeon is very clever			0
i am very happy now			0
’ @entity171 , consultant plastic and reconstructive surgeon and head of the craniofacial unit at @entity30 , said : ‘ @entity5 has been a patient for many years			0
@entity171 , consultant plastic and reconstructive surgeon and head of the craniofacial unit at @entity30 , said @entity5 ( pictured with her parents ) has ' bravely coped ' with her treatment ‘ shortly after birth , she developed a large haemangioma on her nose which caused destruction of part of the nose and ulceration of the skin			1
‘ @entity5 has had extensive treatment for her haemangioma and operations to reconstruct her nose			1
she has bravely coped with the condition and the treatment needed to reconstruct her nose			0
‘ @entity5 is due to have more surgery in the future			2
’ for more information visit @entity198 a haemangioma is the most common type of birthmark			0
it is a benign tumour of the cells which normally line the blood vessels			1
in these birthmarks , the cells multiply more rapidly than normal causing a collection of small blood vessels that form lumps in , or under , the skin			0
about one in every ten babies has a haemangioma and they are most common in girls and premature babies			0
they usually appear when the baby is about two - weeks - old and about 60 per cent develop on the head or neck			1
most do not require any treatment but those near the eye , on the lips , or obstructing the airway do require treatment			0
treatment options include pain relief , beta blockers , laser treatment , steroids and surgery .			0
