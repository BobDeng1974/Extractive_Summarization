lots of people loved @entity5 's @entity4 but it made me more determined than ever to spend summers in @entity9			1
while some of us had to work for a living , off he went in the @entity13 with money in the bank ; bought a dilapidated house ; charmed the locals and wrote whole chapters about eccentric @entity20 plumbers			2
the cash rolled in , but @entity22 became a cliché			1
envious ? @entity25 ? absolutely			2
but that 's nothing compared to @entity37 , my 80 - something mother - in - law , who had n't been to @entity20 for half a century			1
then , to my horror , as soon as the @entity39 pulled out of @entity40 , @entity37 produced a crumpled copy of @entity5 's book and quickly became engrossed			1
getting there is a doddle			2
in high season the train goes all the way from @entity48 to @entity49			2
we picked up a hire car at @entity49 station and headed for our villa just outside pretty @entity54 , which straddles five tributaries of the @entity56 and was once a centre of the cloth industry			2
@entity59 , as our villa is called , is owned by a @entity61 couple			2
they have done a fabulous job : traditional ( terrace sheltered by vines , pool , hewn stone floors , lavender ) but also big on technology ( huge tv showing all the main @entity9 channels and fridges galore )			0
a region of colour and aromas : @entity77 fields of lavender are a welcome sight for visitors to @entity22 i was just uncorking the first bottle of rose and about to toast our good fortune when @entity37 noticed her suitcase was not the one that she 'd left @entity89 with			1
i 'd picked up an entirely different one on arrival in @entity49			0
now we all know @entity20 is in crisis			0
but , what i had n't quite appreciated , is how frustratingly inefficient it is			0
@entity96 offices only operate monday to friday ; there is no number you can call and the police look at you wearily when reporting something missing			0
luckily , it was market day on sunday in @entity54 ( once described as the ' @entity104 ' , which is a little overstating things ) and so we bought several new frocks for @entity37 , before settling down to lunch by the river			0
she was a little down about it all , but her spirits picked up no end that evening when we drove to the hill - top village of @entity113 ( @entity115 - style church , corkscrew museum , teenyweeny streets and , yes , the backdrop to @entity5 's literary money - spinner ) and looked out over the @entity120 , with the @entity122 mountains in the distance			1
two kilometres away is the ravishing @entity124 , a 14 - room hotel ( including one gypsy caravan ) set in acres of its own vineyards			1
@entity130 highs , lovely lows : @entity132 provides a beautiful backdrop to the pretty villages of @entity22 ( left ) - while lunch in the medieval enclave of @entity54 ( right ) , above the @entity56 , will perk up the soul the restaurant ( £ 50 a head , including wine ) is open to non residents - and the food and service assuaged any lingering negativity about the indifference of the @entity20 to missing suitcases			1
@entity147 en @entity22 is an hour south east			1
my wife was insistent that we should visit its famous market and so off we went , only to discover it closes at 1pm			0
how on earth will monsieur @entity154 ever get this country back to work ? then we had the car towed away			0
things could only get better but we 'd not expected fullblown rapture when we stopped off for dinner at @entity162 , an exquisite collection of 16th and 17th century buildings which over the years has been turned into a hotel occupying a prime spot			0
with its creamy stone , bleached shutters and imposing church , it is everything you could want in @entity22 - and more			1
frankly , dinner went straight into my top ten list			0
at 6,273ft metres it 's the highest point in @entity22 , the arid summit way above the tree line			1
it was n't a difficult climb - by car , that is			1
others were doing it on foot or on racing bikes , the latter inspired by the @entity185 , which passes this way most years			0
a familiar sight : @entity132 has often played host to the @entity185 - and is also great for non-cyclists just before you reach the summit , there 's a grave by the side of the road , a memorial to the great @entity9 cyclist @entity197 , who died from heart failure in 1967 on one of the hottest days ever recorded in the race			1
his last words were : ' put me back on the bloody bike			1
' @entity132 is an essential outing			1
so , too , is @entity29 , as long as you go there once the tourist coaches have left			0
the village is irresistibly pretty , so much so my father - in - law very nearly bought a set of those plastic place - mats with scenic photographs complete with a @entity215 from @entity29 inscription			1
i told him that for the same price we could have a cocktail on the terrace of @entity222 , the famous old hotel that tumbles down the rock face just off the main square			0
and that 's what we did			2
we stayed on for a thrilling dinner , during which we learned that the hotel is about to close for a € 16 million refurb ( reopening june 17 )			0
a week in @entity22 might not have the same ring to it as the title of @entity5 's book , but a mere seven days here works wonders for the soul			1
@entity37 even forgave me for the suitcase debacle			0
@entity239 ( 0207 563 7903 ) cvvillas.com offers seven nights at @entity241 , for up to six sharing , from £ 2,675 , including maid service ( but excluding travel , which can be arranged on request )			0
from may 1 , @entity39 ( 03432 186186 ; eurostar.com ) goes direct from @entity40 to @entity49			0
prices from £ 99 return			0
a week 's car rental with @entity249 ( 0845 508 9845 ; rhinocarhire.com ) costs from £ 114 .			2

@entity5 's book @entity251 in @entity22 put the spotlight on the region
but there is more to the region than this old literary *favourite* *suggests*
@entity132 provides a beautiful backdrop - and *spectacular* views
