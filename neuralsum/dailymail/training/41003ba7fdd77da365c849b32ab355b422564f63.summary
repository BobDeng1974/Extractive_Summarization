this week sees the @entity1 ’s first melon juice launching — with a whole melon in every bottle			2
there are two varieties of @entity6 , which will be launching in @entity7 at a special promotional price of £ 1.99 throughout august and at two bottles for £ 4 during september			2
the normal price will be £ 2.49 for a bottle			0
@entity6 is made from pressed melons and nothing else			1
there is no added water , sweeteners or preservatives — and it is low - calorie , fat - free and full of vitamins and minerals			1
it is , the makers say , great to drink after a gym work - out or to cure a hangover ! the brand ’s founder , @entity38 , spent a year working out the best way to turn her home - made melon juice into a viable supermarket product and came across @entity44 — high pressure processing — as the best method			1
the juice is not heat pasteurised , which can destroy the vitamins , minerals and enzymes found in fruit , and it is n’t a cold - pressed juice which often need additives to stop them deteriorating			1
instead , with @entity44 , the melon is skinned , deseeded and juiced and the juice is then subjected to a high level of pressure			0
this inactivates the micro-organisms that cause decay , while at the same time retaining the nutritional value and keeping the juice fresh throughout its shelf life			0
going up , going down : @entity63 reveals the biggest changes between june and july @entity66 chillis are smoked , dried jalapeno chillis used mainly in @entity69 food and in @entity71 style dishes			0

@entity6 is made from pressed melons - it has no added water or sweeteners

makers say it is great to drink after a gym workout or to cure a hangover
