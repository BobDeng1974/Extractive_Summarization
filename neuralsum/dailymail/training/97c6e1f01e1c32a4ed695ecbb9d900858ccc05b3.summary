by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 11:19 est , 7 february 2013 updated : 14:25 est , 7 february 2013 @entity3 prime minister @entity2 arrived for an @entity5 summit at the @entity7 building in @entity8 today , demanding deep cuts in spending @entity2 arrived in @entity8 today for a fresh attempt at cutting the @entity13 ’s vast budget			1
the prime minister insists he will not accept a deal unless the cost of running @entity17 falls for the rest of the decade			1
he has in his sights the @entity17 foreign service , run by @entity3 commissioner @entity22 as part of a demand to cut £ 25billion reduction in the @entity13 ’s lavish spending plans			0
mr @entity2 was due to hold meetings with @entity29 pm @entity28 and other allies this afternoon before tonight ’s formal negotiations over dinner			0
arriving at the summit building in @entity8 , mr @entity2 fire a shot across the bows of other countries who are demanding budgets continue to rise			1
the @entity39 said : ‘ the numbers are much too high			0
they need to come down - and if they do n’t come down there wo n’t be a deal			0
‘ the @entity13 should not be immune to the sorts of pressure we have to reduce spending , find efficiencies and spend wisely - what we are all doing			0
’ talks collapsed in november when mr @entity2 and other major contributors to the @entity13 kitty rejected a cut from a planned spending package of about one thousand billion euros ( £ 860billion ) for 2014 - 2020 to about £ 756bn			0
today @entity55 chancellor @entity54 , who spoke to mr @entity2 last night , admitted that national positions remained ‘ far apart ’			1
and @entity58 president @entity57 went in saying compromise was needed , but making plain cuts in @entity13 agriculture spending - from which @entity58 benefits hugely - were not on his negotiating agenda			1
mr @entity57 said : ‘ we must not weaken the ( @entity13 ) economy			1
i am here for agreement , if a deal is reasonable			2
@entity17 must find compromise , but must maintain growth and solidarity			2
he is expected to press for a reduction in staffing and spending at the @entity87 , which is run by @entity22 , who is paid £ 70,000 more than the prime minister			1
the @entity90 peer originally pledged the foreign service would be ‘ budget neutral ’ but has presided over a five per cent rise in spending during the last year			2
mr @entity2 will also seek to slash the number of @entity8 civil servants and cut back their pay and perks			0
but @entity3 officials privately admit that even if mr @entity2 gets his way , @entity3 ’s contributions to the @entity13 budget are likely to rise because of the continuing fallout from @entity105 ’s decision in 2005 to surrender a huge chunk of the @entity13 ’s annual rebate			2
@entity55 chancellor @entity54 warned @entity13 countries remain ‘ far apart ’ while @entity58 president @entity57 insisted compromise was needed @entity3 sources last night acknowledged it would be ‘ tough ’ to get a deal , but said the prime minister believed there was scope for mr @entity81 ’s latest proposals to be slashed by ‘ tens of billions ’			1
@entity117 yesterday denied that @entity3 was facing a ‘ wall of hostility ’ in @entity8 following @entity2 ’s pledge last month to hold an in / out referendum after the next election			0
the foreign secretary told @entity124 that he ‘ did n’t detect any change in our ability to get our own way or any difficulties ’ in his latest negotiations with @entity17 counterparts			0
he said @entity3 would accept the result of the referendum ‘ whatever the consequences ’ - but conceded civil servants were not making preparations for a possible withdrawal			0
@entity3 will hold the rotating @entity13 presidency in the second half of 2017 and mr @entity117 said he could not rule out holding the referendum during it , as the timing depended on the progress of repatriating powers			0
he said it would ‘ certainly make for a particularly memorable presidency ’			0
the situation is complicated by a series of competing demands from virtually all of the 27 countries involved			1
@entity55 , @entity75 , @entity150 and the @entity29 are looking to have their existing budget rebates extended for another seven years , while @entity153 has warned it will veto a deal unless it is granted a rebate for the first time			1
mr @entity2 told reporters that the @entity13 's budget deal was ' too high ' and must be cut before he would agree to a deal before arriving in @entity8 , mr @entity2 made a series of calls to @entity13 allies who are also demanding a reduction in spending @entity58 is looking to protect farm subsidies , while @entity168 ’s @entity167 , who is in the midst of a general election campaign , is seeking to ringfence spending on infrastructure			1
any deal will also have to be signed off by the @entity17 parliament which has demanded an astonishing £ 910 billion budget			2
@entity176 , director of the think tank @entity177 said it was vital the budget was reformed , as well as cut , to focus spending on areas more likely to boost @entity17 ’s flagging economy			2
he said : ‘ we see a 35 per cent probability of a deal this week			0
if @entity168 and @entity58 keep on insisting on more cash to achieve short - term political gains , the talks will fail			1
’ if no deal is done by the end of the year then the current @entity13 budget will be automatically rolled over into 2014 and increased by two per cent to allow for inflation .			2
