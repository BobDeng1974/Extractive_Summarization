speaking ahead of talks with @entity7 at @entity8 , mr @entity0 declined to comment in detail about the @entity2 ’s controversial claims , but said : ‘ he ’s a young man , and young men do make mistakes talking			1
’ mr @entity0 also provocatively claimed that life in @entity1 ’s notorious @entity16 province was better , and safer , before @entity18 troops arrived in 2006			1
‘ take a life to save a life , that ’s what we revolve around , ’ he said			0
‘ if there ’s people trying to do bad stuff to our guys , then we ’ll take them out of the game			0

’ but he insisted he did not want to ‘ blame ’ @entity18 for making the situation worst – and insisted that @entity1 ‘ appreciate the sacrifices of the @entity18 forces ’			2
mr @entity0 said it was unclear whether @entity18 and the @entity82 , which will withdraw combat troops next year , were leaving because they thought they had achieved their mission in weakening @entity85 or because they had realised they were ‘ fighting in the wrong place in the first place , so they should discontinue doing that and leave ’			1
