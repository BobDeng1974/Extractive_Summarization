by @entity0 published : 19:23 est , 13 march 2013 updated : 04:08 est , 14 march 2013 speaking out : an e-petition calling on the prime minister to block @entity4 and @entity5 workers from coming to the @entity6 has gathered 100,000 signatures potentially prompting a debate in the @entity9 a petition calling on @entity11 to block @entity4 and @entity5 workers from coming to @entity6 is being signed by 5,000 people a day			1
so far 100,000 have signed the @entity14 e-petition – and the scale of public feeling means the issue is likely to be raised in the @entity9			1
@entity4 and @entity5 joined the @entity18 in 2007 , but the number of low - skilled workers who could get jobs in @entity6 was capped at 25,000			1
that limit expires at the end of this year			1
the campaigners want the barrier to remain active for another five years			0
their open letter , which is available to read online , says : ‘ in 2014 , @entity18 restrictions are set be removed , allowing nationals of @entity5 and @entity4 free movement to the @entity6			1
the move is similar to the one that granted access to around 600,000 @entity35 immigrants to enter @entity6 over recent years			0
‘ despite @entity5 and @entity4 joining the @entity18 in 2005 , restrictions were put on the number who could come to @entity6			1
however , those restrictions will be abolished in 2014			0
once the restrictions are lifted all newcomers will be entitled to claim benefits , housing , child , jobseekers etc. ’ quoting estimates that there are currently 1.5million people seeking work across the two countries , the e-petition warns the move could put pressure on ‘ housing , infrastructure , schools and healthcare ’			1
ministers have not calculated how many people they expect to arrive next year			0
but an influx of economic migrants could undermine the prime minister ’s goal of cutting net migration – the difference between those arriving and leaving – to ‘ tens of thousands ’			0
sir @entity65 , chairman of the @entity67 think - tank , said : ‘ this is another indication of the strength of public concern about the risk of a significant inflow from @entity4 and @entity5			2
’ his researchers believe around 50,000 @entity4 and @entity5 nationals will come to @entity6 every year from january 2014			1
@entity76 problem : earlier this month the left - wing mayor of @entity78 , in @entity76 , warned that @entity5 and @entity4 migrants had wreaked havoc on his town at the moment they are only allowed to work here if they are self - employed or investors , or if they take short - term employment as fruit pickers			2
but after january , bosses will have to treat new arrivals from the countries exactly the same as @entity6 workers			2
@entity4 politicians have rejected claims that the @entity94 will see a flood of arrivals			0
they point to the fact that many have already arrived including thousands of labourers who worked on the @entity100			0
however , both @entity4 and @entity5 are relatively poor countries , with a minimum wage of around £ 1 an hour compared to £ 6.19 here			2
systematic pressure : the e-petition warns the move to lift restrictions could put pressure on ' housing , infrastructure , schools and healthcare ' and the @entity6 offers full benefits when immigrants find work , including housing and child benefit and child tax credit			1
earlier this month the left - wing mayor of @entity78 , in @entity76 , offered @entity6 a cautionary tale			0
@entity118 warned that @entity5 and @entity4 immigrants had wreaked havoc on his town , sending crime rates soaring			2
he said : ‘ it is costing us millions and will cost us more			0
we did n’t ask for this problem and we ca n’t handle it alone			0
’ under current rules , any @entity14 e-petition that attracts 100,000 signatures has to be passed to the @entity130 and considered for a parliamentary debate .			1

100,000 signed a @entity14 e-petition so could be raised in *commons*
calls for a block on @entity4 and @entity5 workers coming to the @entity6
countries currently limited to 25,000 low - skilled jobs in the @entity6 every year
limit expires at end of the year prompting campaigners to call for extension
warning that influx could put pressure on housing , schools and healthcare
