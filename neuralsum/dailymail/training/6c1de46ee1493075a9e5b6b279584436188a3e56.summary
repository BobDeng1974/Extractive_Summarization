dressed in a sweat top , skinny jeans and pumps , it ’s the perfect casual look for a night at the cinema			0
this , however , was @entity7 dressed for a date at the @entity9 with her former boyfriend , prince @entity10			1
the sight of the pair furtively slipping out of the pictures after a mid-week date led to fevered speculation yesterday that their romance may be blossoming again			0
it is the second time the couple , who dated for two years before suddenly splitting back in april , have been seen in public together over the last few days			1
on sunday night the 25 - year - old budding actress was a guest at a concert in @entity39 to mark the end of the prince ’s remarkable @entity41 for injured service personnel			1
there are also reports they have been seen together in a @entity39 bar			0
super cool : in july ( left ) on her way to performing ' theres a monster in the @entity52 ' and arriving at the wedding of @entity54 and @entity55 ( right ) in a backless dress the couple were accompanied by a group of friends on their visit to the cinema ( where princess @entity62 often used to take her two sons ) on tuesday			0
it ’s just a short hop from @entity10 ’s bachelor pad at @entity66			2
and their viewing matter – @entity69 , which sees @entity71 ’s character try to spice up her love life with a raunchy home video – was n’t exactly the stuff of hearts and flowers			2
but the fact that they felt comfortable enough to go out in public together again suggests their relationship is getting back on track			0
friends say they are taking things ‘ slow and steadily ’ – very steadily as far as @entity20 is concerned			2
one member of her circle told the @entity89 that until recently the former dance student was still in two minds as to whether she had done the right thing in splitting up from the prince			0
she went backless at the @entity95 on june 10 and wore short denim shorts at @entity97 ‘ she was clearly very much in love with him but the issues that drove a wedge between them – @entity10 ’s commitment and the pressure that going out with a prince brings – were still clearly there , ’ the source said			1
contrary to reports , @entity20 was not present at @entity10 ’s black - tie 30th birthday bash at @entity110 on wednesday night			1
instead she joined friends at the relaunch of a club in @entity115 , dressed in typically funky attire of black shorts and canvas pumps			0
when the couple realised they had been spotted by photographers as they came out of the cinema , @entity10 and his ex quickly went their separate ways , with the prince jumping into his waiting @entity126 along with his bodyguards and @entity20 hailing a taxi further down the road			1
on sunday the couple also deliberately did n’t speak , even though they were yards from each other in the vip area of the @entity134 for @entity10 ’s concert , and @entity20 had raced back from a friend ’s wedding in @entity138 to be there			1
the 25 - year - old wore a stunning blue dress at @entity142 in may ( left ) and a black dress with a daring thigh split while walking in @entity145 in fact the blonde stuck like glue to her best friend , princess @entity149 – widely believed to have introduced the couple – who was openly kissing and cuddling her own boyfriend , @entity151			1
the dilemma for @entity20 , says one who knows her well , is simple : can she dovetail her fondness for the fourth in line to the throne with her desire to seek a career on the stage ? having recently starred in a well - received play , there ’s a monster in @entity52 , posed for @entity168 ’s @entity167 and snagged a bit part in a new film with model @entity171 , @entity20 ’s career is going from strength to strength			1
‘ all this not only made her feel good about herself but made her stock rise , ’ says a family friend			0
@entity10 is said to have always been ‘ madly keen ’ on @entity20			1
according to sources , she was never far from his mind and he has deluged the blonde with calls and texts			0
one friend continued : ‘ the really interesting story here is how @entity10 has changed since he has known @entity188			2
he was a liability , but is now one of the @entity192 ’s most successful ambassadors			0
‘ i am certain @entity20 is at least partly responsible for the metamorphosis			2
she is a very good influence on his life			0
