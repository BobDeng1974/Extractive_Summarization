the live tiger mascot for @entity1 has missed all seven homes games this season - opting instead to stay in his luxurious enclosure			1
@entity5 is the latest in @entity1 's dynasty of tigers that have represented the team since 1936			1
between games , he lives in a 15,000 - square - foot environment with a waterfall , stream , rocks , trees , and personal carers			2
but for the past few weeks , his keepers have failed to coax him into the bespoke cage that takes him to the @entity18 just across the street , where there is a bronze statue of him standing by the entrance			1
not in the mood ? @entity5 has refused to leave his enclosure to go to @entity1 matches across the street settled at home : here the nine - year - old appears more comfortable in his 15,000 - square - foot enclosure traditionally , nine - year - old @entity5 is driven around the stadium as cheerleaders perform their routine on top of his trailer			1
he is then stationed by the opposing team 's locker room , roaring menacingly as they emerge onto the pitch			2
but it seems he may have had enough - and has also chewed up the @entity1 sign in his habitat			1
fans are distraught , with many calling and writing to @entity1 executives with suggestions			1
dr @entity45 , the univeristy 's director of lab animals and @entity5 's vet , defensively rebuffed the criticism , telling @entity49 : ' cat people know that cats do what cats are going to do			2
' life is on their terms			0
you ca n't force them and we have no way of forcing him			0
ok ? i 'll say that again			0
menacing : @entity5 is the latest in a dynasty of tigers who instill fear in the opposing team by roaring as they arrive ritual : he is normally carted around the @entity18 with cheerleaders on his trailer to the delight of fans abandoning the team ? @entity5 has also chewed up the @entity1 sign that used to hang in his habitat over the road luxurious : @entity5 's abode is decked out with a pool , a waterfall , rocks , trees and @entity84 structures living the life : he has a team of vets and carers that routinely check his teeth and pamper his paws ' we have no way of forcing him			1
we would n't if we did			0
you ca n't entice them			0
' people call me with brilliant ideas			0
" put a steak in the trailer ! " oh wow , 20 years we never thought of that			0
' when cats think something is up , they 're very wary animals and this is an apex predator			0
' he 's a fully mature tiger			0
substitute : crowds have had to make do with a man in a tiger costume for the last seven games help ? @entity1 's coach @entity113 has appealed for four or five slow - moving adults to help get @entity5 to games ' why would he ever come out of his night house and get in the trailer ? the fact that he ever does amazes me			1
' he 's exhibiting perfectly normal behavior and that 's to stay put			0
' however , @entity1 coach @entity113 was more reticent , appealing on his weekly radio show for volunteers to help get @entity5 to matches			1
he said they need ' four to five slow - moving adults ... to encourage him into the cage ' .			2

@entity5 normally parades @entity18 in a cage , roars at *opposition*
he has refused to leave his enclosure across the street all season this year
he also chewed up the @entity1 sign in the enclosure
