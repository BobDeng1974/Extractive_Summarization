by @entity0 an oil worker who has been facing bankrupcy by spending £ 250,000 on legal fees today won a 16 - year court battle over a laptop			2
@entity6 , a 44 - year - old father of two , claimed that @entity7 ruined his credit rating after he tried to back out of an agreement to buy a computer from @entity11 for £ 1,499			1
he took his case to court and initially won , but it was overturned			0
however , today the @entity14 in @entity15 allowed his appeal and ruled he should receive damages of £ 8,000			1
victory : @entity6 has won a 16 - year legal battle over a laptop and been awarded £ 8,000 in damages			1
however the case has cost him £ 250,000 mr @entity6 said that he was disappointed the @entity14 did not restore the damages of £ 116,000 awarded by a @entity25 court in 2008			1
but he added in a statement : ‘ this decision is a great victory for all consumers and i am proud to have been the driving force behind it			1
long battle : father - of - two @entity6 claimed that @entity7 ruined his credit rating ‘ as a result of the decision , no consumer will have to endure again what i had to put up with - the loss of the ability to buy a family home because of wrongful blacklisting of me			1
‘ taking a case to any court is a huge stress , but taking it to the highest court in the land with all the risks that go with it was the most stressful thing that anyone could voluntarily put themselves through			0
but sometimes you have to do what is right , and not what is easy			0
‘ this case was not all about me			0
it was about principle for all consumers			0
i always felt that @entity11 and @entity7 had acted disgracefully towards me , and i have now been proved right			2
’ in an earlier hearing , a court ordered the bank to pay him £ 116,000 in damages , but after that decision was reversed he launched a new appeal at the highest court in @entity65			2
mr @entity6 , an offshore construction surveyor , bought the laptop from the @entity69 branch of @entity11 in 1998 , paying a £ 50 deposit and signing a £ 1,499 credit agreement with @entity7 - now part of @entity73 - for the remainder			1
he claimed he was told he could get a refund if he had a problem with the computer , but when he complained that it did not have an inbuilt modem a manager said he could not have his money back			2
although @entity11 eventually relented , @entity7 told mr @entity6 he was obliged to carry on making payments , arguing that the credit agreement was legally unrelated to the purchase of the computer			1
he was put on a credit blacklist until 2005 , which he believes prevented him from buying a new home in @entity89			2
mr @entity6 insisted all along that the credit agreement with @entity7 was dependent on the purchase of the laptop , meaning that it was void as soon as he returned the computer			1
