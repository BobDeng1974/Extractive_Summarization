by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 04:11 est , 23 january 2014 updated : 04:45 est , 23 january 2014 a @entity4 cabinet minister has dismissed groping claims against @entity6 as a ‘ scandal without the sex ’			1
@entity10 secretary @entity9 is also under fire after warning the party must stop ‘ washing its dirty linen in public ’			1
one alleged victim of @entity6 condemned the remarks , insisting the ‘ smears have to stop ’ as the crisis engulfing @entity20 ’s leadership showed no sign of abating			1
@entity4 @entity10 secretary @entity9 ( left ) warned the party against washing its dirty linen in public and called mediation to end the legal stand - off with @entity6 @entity6 has begun legal action against the @entity4 after his party membership was suspended because he refused to bow to mr @entity20 ’s call to apologise for his behaviour			1
an internal inquiry found that four women had made ‘ credible ’ allegations against the peer , but there was a less than 50 per cent chance they would pass the burden of proof ‘ beyond reasonable doubt ’			0
in response , the alleged victims also refused to rule out legal action against the peer , who as the party ’s chief executive led the @entity4 to a string of by - election wins			1
to add to the @entity4 ’ woes , the party last night finally suspended the membership of mp @entity49 , more than three years after a vulnerable constituent first complained about him			1
as chief executive from 2003 to 2009 , @entity6 was one of the most powerful figures in the @entity4			1
in charge of almost every area of policy , he masterminded a string of by - election wins which built the number of mps in the @entity60			0
but after he stood down citing ill - health , rumours emerged about his behaviour towards female activists			2
four women are known to have made complaints about his behaviour			0
all of them have described inappropriate touching and advances			0
@entity70 , a former special adviser to @entity20 , said the peer behaved in a sexually inappropriate manner towards her over a cup of coffee at a party conference in @entity76 in 2003			2
@entity6 was ‘ touching my legs and my knees and he did it two or three times ’ , she said			1
miss @entity70 said he invited her to his room and was ‘ clearly not noticing the signals ’			0
another unnamed alleged victim , a party candidate , was at an event with other @entity4 when a friend suggested taking a photo			1
she said @entity6 , who was standing next to her , ‘ shoved his hand down the back of my dress ’			1
@entity92 , a former activist , said @entity6 allegedly sat between her and a friend at his house and then started moving his hands ‘ down our backs and places where they had absolutely no business being ’			1
@entity100 , a senior @entity4 who chairs the party ’s conferences , also alleged she had been inappropriately touched			1
a report by @entity104 last weekfound that four women had made ‘ credible ’ allegations against the peer , but there was a less than 50 per cent chance they would pass the burden of proof ‘ beyond reasonable doubt ’			0
however , he recommended @entity6 apologise to ' distress ' his behaviour caused			1
@entity6 refused , so the party suspended him while it investigates whether he has brought the party into disrepute			1
the peer denies any wrongdoing and is threatening to sue the @entity4 for suspending his membership after refusing to say sorry to the women			0
incredibly , mr @entity20 acted only after an independent report by a @entity123 , who found prima facie evidence that the 67 - year - old mp was guilty of ‘ serious and unwelcome sexual behaviour ’ , was leaked online			0
as the @entity4 ’ reputation becomes increasingly damaged , mr @entity9 appeared to suggest the party should deal with the @entity6 scandal behind closed doors			1
he told reporters : ‘ i think that it is not good for any political party to be seen to be washing its dirty linen in public			2
sadly it is happening here			0
’ asked how he would characterise the ‘ situation ’ , he said : ‘ i would say scandal without the sex			0
’ mr @entity9 , a former @entity4 chief whip promoted to @entity142 in october , called for mediation between @entity6 and his accusers to resolved the legal stand - off			1
he said : ‘ we are in a situation where you have effectively got two camps and at a time when you are seeing the economy turning a corner , economic growth taking hold , i think there is a frustration amongst the party activists that we are not able to talk about that because we are talking so much about our own internal matters			1
‘ what i am quite keen to see is that there is a some sort of mediation set up that will allow both parties to find a way through this because clearly we have got something that now needs an early resolution and the only way i see achieving that is to have some third party involvement in mediation			2
’ however @entity92 , who has accused @entity6 of groping her , hit back : ‘ the linen needs to be washed one way or another , especially when the threat to women is ongoing			1
’ she stressed that mediation is the best way forward but only if the right preconditions are in place			0
‘ the smears have to stop and mediation needs to be done by specialists in these sensitive issues , ’ she wrote on @entity178			0
miss @entity92 , a former activist , claims that she and a friend were once invited back to the @entity6 ’s house after dinner in central @entity186			1
@entity6 allegedly sat between the two women and then started moving his hands ‘ down our backs and places where they had absolutely no business being ’			1
he then told them not to go home and that there were no taxis			0
the women discovered that he had locked the front door and he apparently opened it only when they insisted they wanted to go home			0
@entity6 has always denied behaving inappropriately			1
mr @entity20 yesterday admitted his handling of the claims against @entity6 last year was ‘ not ideal ’ as he vowed not to back down in calling for an apology from the @entity4 peer			2
the deputy prime minister also conceded that ‘ alarm bells did not go off ’ within the party when the allegations were first made several years ago			2
admission : @entity4 leader @entity20 said the party 's handling of the crisis was ' not ideal ' mr @entity20 insisted he would not drop his demand for an apology			2
he told @entity214 : ‘ let me really be open with you , i actually think the way that we handled it last year was n’t great , was n’t ideal			0
‘ much more seriously than that , looking much further back , it is quite clear that when the women were first caused this distress , many , many years ago … the party did not react , the alarm bells did not go off , and there were n’t procedures , and that ’s what i ’ve apologised to them in person , and publically			0
’ mr @entity20 said he had to demand that @entity6 says sorry - even if only for causing ‘ inadvertent ’ distress to women			2
@entity9 was appointed @entity10 secretary to lead the charge against independence @entity9 is not a household name , but is incredibly influential in @entity235			1
when the coalition was formed in 2010 he became the party 's chief whip - an enforcer ion the shadows to keep @entity241 in line when the going got tough			0
it is the whip 's job to know the ambitions and darkest secrets and keep them out of the public eye			0
in october 's reshuffle he was appointed @entity142 , to take the fight to @entity251 ahead of the independence referendum			0
mr @entity9 , who admits his personality can be ' volatile ' , is seen as a sharp , witty , blunt - speaking figure able to take on mr @entity251			2
raised in the @entity255 , he graduated from @entity256 with a law degree , later becoming a procurator fiscal in the north - east			0
he was elected mp for @entity261 and @entity262 in 2001			0

in 2011 he struck up a friendship with @entity270 , drummer with piano - rock band @entity271 while visiting death - row inmates in @entity274			0
mr @entity9 married @entity275 in 1987 and they have two sons , @entity278 and @entity279 .			2
