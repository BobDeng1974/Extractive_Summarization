by @entity0 published : 10:06 est , 8 november 2012 updated : 12:01 est , 8 november 2012 sometimes the dreaded @entity1 makes us do crazy things			0
and that 's precisely what has happened to 28 - year - old @entity7 from @entity8 , @entity9 , this november			1
or , rather , this @entity10			2
so bored was the travel radio presenter of being unable to join her male mates ' mission to grow a november moustache ( in effort to raise money and awareness for prostate cancer ) that she decided to do the next best thing : draw one on			1
day one : everyone has to start somewhere , @entity7 , chin up ! the imaginative girl , who aims to raise over £ 1,000 for @entity27 @entity26 through sponsorship , has pledged to draw a comedy moustache on her face every day throughout november			1
and only eight days in she has already raised nearly half her target total			0
the idea started as a joke , but now , in keeping with the theme of the @entity10 , @entity7 's moustache will grow as the month goes on			1
and the ( unofficial ) @entity37 lookalike 's ' tache - which started as a @entity38 - style square directly under her nose - has already ' grown ' to reach the end of her lips			0
@entity42 @entity7 promises that by the end of the month , she will be sporting a full - on curly moustache			2
@entity46 , i presume ? @entity7 regards her new lip ' hair ' suspiciously on day two , left , and looks pleased with it on day four , right @entity7 , who presents travel radio across the @entity51 , said : ' i sponsor my mates to do @entity10 every year , and i think it 's a great cause			1
' i was always a little jealous that i could n't join in the fun though - and this year i jokingly posted on @entity55 that i was going to draw on a moustache to join in			0
' so many people responded to it and said it was a great idea - and that they would sponsor me to do it , so i decided to bite the bullet and go for it			0
' my friends think it 's hilarious , and it 's fine when i 'm at work or with my family , but i do get some funny looks in the street			0
' i went shopping in the @entity70 last week and people were almost falling over , doing double takes			0
i 'm definitely earning my sponsorship money ! ' why should boys have all the fun ? things are beginning to look up on day three , left , and @entity7 's moustache begins to rival her eyebrows in size on day four , right and altruistic @entity7 is not only doing her bit for prostate cancer - she regularly volunteers her time at a shelter , too			1
she said : ' i volunteer at a homeless shelter once a week , and the guys there thought it was hilarious when i turned up sporting a curly moustache			0
' my aim is to raise more than £ 1000 for @entity27 @entity26 - i 'm about half way there at the moment			1
' i think it 's so important to raise as much awareness of cancer and fundraising as possible - it 's a cause very close to my heart , and hopefully i 'm doing my bit			2
' @entity7 has already raised £ 429 , and to add to her grand total visit www.justgiving.com/thecrazytashlady			1
