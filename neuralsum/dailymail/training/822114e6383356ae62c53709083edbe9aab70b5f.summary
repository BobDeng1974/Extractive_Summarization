@entity0 came to @entity2 's rescue again on thursday , scoring two goals , one of them among the most spectacular ever seen at an @entity4 , to lead the host - nation into the semi-finals			1
with his team mates all fluffing their chances in front of goal , @entity0 took it upon himself to calm @entity2 's jitters and secure a 2 - 0 win over @entity14 in the quarter - finals at @entity17 's @entity16			1
both goals came in the second half but it was the first , four minutes after the re-start , that will be remembered for years to come and go viral on the internet			0
@entity0 opened the scoring for @entity2 with a stunning bicycle kick against @entity14 in the @entity4 the home crowd were treated to a fine performance from the 35 - year - old , who rolled back the years @entity14 : @entity30 ; @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 ( @entity34 46 ) ; @entity35 , @entity36 ( @entity37 83 ) , @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 ( @entity42 72 ) ; @entity43 subs not used : @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 @entity2 : @entity54 ; @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 ; @entity59 ( @entity60 60 ) , @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 ( @entity64 69 ) , @entity65 ; @entity0 ( @entity66 80 ) subs not used : @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 goals : @entity0 49 , 65 referee : @entity77 attendance : 46,067 @entity0 has made a habit of scoring stunning goals for his country -- most memorably his volley against the @entity83 in last year 's @entity84 -- but thursday 's eye - popper was perhaps his finest			1
when @entity14 failed to clear the ball from an @entity88 corner , @entity55 innocuously headed the ball into the box in the direction of @entity0 , who seemingly had nowhere to go with a defender breathing down his neck			2
but the 35 - year - old , displaying the sort of athleticism of a teenager , leapt into the air and performed a perfect overhead bicycle kick , angling the ball across the six - yard box past the astonished @entity103 goalkeeper @entity30			1
' it was instinctive , ' he later told a news conference			0
' @entity106 was probably a fluke and today was a probably a fluke again			0
' i still know i can change games , i still know i can write my own script and at the same time effect football in @entity2 in a big way			0
' i 've never ever once not believed in the national team jersey ... and when i get my chance then i have to take it			0
' @entity0 celebrates after scoring against @entity14 in a game which saw @entity2 progress to the semi-finals @entity63 hugs @entity0 ( front ) after he scored at the @entity16 in @entity17 on thursday it was a moment of theatrical magic that not only revived @entity2 's title hopes but instantly breathed new life into the tournament			1
sixteen minutes later , @entity0 scored again , killing off @entity14 's hopes of going any further in the tournament , when he neatly headed the ball into the corner of the net after a cross from @entity63 , who also had a fine match			2
already @entity2 's all - time leading score , @entity0 's brace lifted his international tally to 39 goals from 80 appearances and saved his country 's blushes			1
the @entity88 will now play either @entity140 or the @entity141 in next week 's semi-finals			0
@entity143 will face @entity144 or @entity145 in the other semi			0

@entity0 gestures to the @entity88 fans in celebration as he helped his country reach the @entity4 semis @entity2 captain jedinak waves to the supporters after leading the @entity2 to victory in @entity17 they also provided their supporters with some heart flutters , carelessly giving the ball away on a handful of occasions and allowing @entity14 to threaten on the counter attack			1
the @entity88 captain @entity62 , returning to the side after missing the last two group games with an ankle injury , was among the worst offenders and allowed his frustrations to get the better of him when he was booked for a reckless tackle on @entity32			2
@entity14 spent most of the first half defending deep inside their own territory but pressed forward after falling behind and came close to scoring with @entity31 unleashing a rocket from long - range that forced @entity54 to make a diving save			2
@entity179 and @entity43 also tested out the @entity88 keeper but the visitors were unable to respond to @entity0 's brace and bowed out of the competition as the @entity88 marched on .			0
