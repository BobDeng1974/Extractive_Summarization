the @entity1 army has demolished thousands of buildings at a @entity1 army base in @entity4 , as the military ends its war in the region			2
the demolition is taking place at @entity10 , one of the largest @entity1 bases in the country , located 50 km north of @entity14			1

the operation comes as the massive @entity47 - led fighting force pulls out of the region after more than a decade on the ground fighting the @entity17			2
the wooden offices and dormitories being destroyed are a part of buildings that were hurriedly erected at @entity10			1
the buildings housed troops who first arrived in the country after 2001 when the @entity1 sent an extra 30,000 soldiers in the 2010 ' surge '			1
at the height of the war , 130,000 international troops were fighting in @entity4			0
but combat operations will finish at the end of the year and only 12,500 soldiers will remain into 2015 on a training and support mission			0
war : this chart shows the number of @entity1 troops who were deployed to the country and casualties since 2001 ' this is definitely a full - time job for us , ' @entity1 staff sergeant @entity74 , head of one of the demolition teams at @entity10 said			1
' part of the process is removing all the interior rooms and electrical components and separating them so they can be properly disposed of			0
' soldiers wearing yellow hardhats use crowbars and hammers to dismantle the vacated buildings that once housed desks , computers and bunk - beds			2
the work is fast but painstaking as material is sifted into different components for recycling or disposal , ensuring that no electrical items or other potential bomb - making kit can fall into @entity17 hands			0
' we absolutely do that in the most environmentally - conscious way that we possibly can , ' @entity74 said			0

' the splintered remains of each building are scooped into dumper trucks that make endless journeys back and forth to a tipping site on the edge of the base			0
dubbed @entity140 - more after @entity141 -- the @entity1 mountain carved into the faces of former presidents -- the dump is opened to @entity4 companies who salvage what they can from the debris			0
lieutenant @entity150 , who oversees the project said : ' right now we 've taken down about 1,800 temporary structures that were either living space or offices			1
' he said more than 2,000 buildings will be destroyed by december , with a final 500 torn down by contractors next year after the @entity1 military engineers have left			1
but as the base shrinks , it is also a hub for the retrograde operation to remove weapons , equipment and vehicles from @entity4 as troops draw in from the provinces			0

she said : ' we have a lot of folks coming in from other bases that we 're sending home ' ' we are retrograding equipment in preparation ( for the @entity47 support mission ) and preparing @entity10 to be turned over , at some point in the next couple of years , to the @entity4			0
' cargo aircraft loaded with gear and troops wait on the runway to leave the country , while elsewhere @entity4 teams scour the site of a demolished canteen , even picking up spare nails left on the ground			0
tidy : a soldier rakes debris into a pile at the @entity206 which is located near @entity14 and was home to soldiers bricks : @entity1 soldiers load debris onto a backhoe - loader as other soldiers help to create the pile of debris material : a soldier drags away a metal panel and plastic from a site at the base occupants : the discarded hat of a @entity1 soldier is pictured at quarters marked for demolition at @entity10 rest : ' this is definitely a full - time job , ' @entity1 staff sergeant @entity74 , head of one of the demolition teams said @entity10 's permanent buildings and roads are being kept for the @entity1 forces that will still be deployed next year , and then for the @entity4 military that will be left to thwart any @entity17 resurgence			1
in 2001 , about 30,000 foreign soldiers and civilians were housed at the former @entity239 base , but the number is down to 15,000 today and will be cut to 6,000 @entity1 troops next year			2
by the end of 2016 , the only @entity1 military presence in @entity4 will be at the embassy in @entity14			2
the reality that , after 13 years of war , the @entity1 military 's vast apparatus is on its way out is only just sinking in even for the soldiers themselves , according to @entity251			0
' they want to see the mission through , so it 's tough even getting military people to understand that we are changing , ' she said .			0
