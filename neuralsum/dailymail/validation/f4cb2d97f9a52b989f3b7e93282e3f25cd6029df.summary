@entity0 insists @entity1 is not suffering from a crisis of confidence and expects him to play a major role in @entity6 's push for @entity8 glory and @entity10 qualification			1
@entity11 became @entity14 football 's most expensive signing when he joined @entity6 from @entity15 for Â£ 59.7million last august but the @entity18 @entity17 star has struggled to justify that huge fee since scoring three times in his first five appearances			2
the 27 - year - old wideman has netted only once in 19 games and been substituted in @entity6 's last three @entity25 matches			1
@entity1 ( left ) has been backed by @entity0 to show his quality for @entity6 but @entity6 assistant manager @entity0 is adamant @entity11 has a big part to play in the club achieving their end - of - season goals , starting with @entity32 's @entity8 quarter - final visit to @entity33 on monday night			1
' i think his confidence is fine , ' @entity0 told @entity36			0
' he 's a quality player and we 'll be looking for him to produce because it is big game after big game now			0
assistant manager @entity0 denied claims that the 27 - year - old was suffering from confidence issues ' players get used to different leagues , sometimes quickly and sometimes it takes a bit of time			1
' he had a really good start to the season but with players who take risks and who can win games it 's always difficult to be consistent because they will try things that other players wo n't do			0
' they 're capable of doing that and that 's why they 're match - winners and the best players			2
' @entity6 are involved in a thrilling race for @entity10 football with @entity32 , @entity66 , @entity67 and @entity68 still chasing a top - four @entity25 finish as well as top two @entity70 and @entity71			1
the summer transfer from @entity15 has scored only once in 19 appearances for his new club @entity77 's side are currently fourth after losing only two of their last 18 league matches and , although the nature of @entity6 's performances have often been criticised , @entity0 says that form counts for far more at this stage of the season			1
' this is the time really when results are the top focus and then the performances will come and the confidence you get from that , ' said @entity0 , who again denied media talk of a rift with @entity94 by saying they had a ' great working relationship '			2
' i think we 've tried a lot of systems this year and obviously the manager 's new to the players and new to the league , so that 's going to take time			0
' but over the last three months or so we 've only been beaten twice and we 're in pretty good form			0
@entity107 disposes @entity11 at @entity108 where the midfielder was later substituted ' it 's tight and all the teams up there are in relatively good form			2
' it could come to a few head - to - heads and we 've got to play a few of the top teams yet , so it 's going to be exciting right to the end			0
' before then , however , @entity6 are focusing on the @entity8 and opponents against whom @entity0 memorably scored an @entity8 semi-final winner in the club 's 1999 ' @entity123 ' year			1
@entity6 have won the competition a record 11 times - a total cup holders @entity32 matched last year by beating @entity133 at @entity134 - but not since 2004 when @entity0 was part of the side which beat @entity129 3 - 0 at the @entity130 in his native @entity131			1
' we 've got so much history in the cup that it 's long overdue , ' @entity0 said			2
@entity138 replaces the winger who was taken off for the third consecutive @entity25 match ' the club as a whole , the players and the fans are desperate to get to @entity134			2
' we 've had great battles and tussles over the years with @entity32 , especially in the cup			0
' of course , i 've got fond memories of the semi-final ( 1999 ) and they beat us in the final ( 2005 ) , but hopefully we can get through to the semis because whoever goes through in this tie has a great chance of winning the cup			0
' @entity0 won the @entity8 four times during a celebrated @entity6 senior playing career which spanned an incredible 24 seasons but admits he is learning all the time on the coaching front			1
the former @entity15 man failed to make an impact during @entity6 's last match against @entity163 ' i 've enjoyed every minute working under @entity164 , ' @entity0 said			1
' he 's been brilliant with me and we 've helped each other along the way			0
' he 's come into a new league which i know all about			0
i 'm starting all over again with coaching and serving an apprenticeship and who better to learn from than someone who is a great leader and has won so much over the years ? ' i 'm learning all the time and just trying to prepare myself the best i can that if i do become a manager i 'm best equipped			0
' @entity0 was in @entity175 encouraging people to nominate a @entity177 for the @entity179 & @entity178			0
to nominate visit www.mcdonalds.co.uk/awards the former @entity6 star was in @entity175 to take a training session with a group of budding footballers @entity0 visited an @entity185 to help the @entity187 's campaign to nominate a @entity177			1
