most people upsize their house to accommodate a growing family			1
but retired couple @entity3 and @entity4 have a rather more fuzzy reason for moving into a bigger home – because behind the doors of their new residence live hundreds and hundreds of teddy bears			1
the pair have more than 600 of the cuddly toys crammed into their four - bedroom detached property			1
@entity15 surrounded by his collection of some 600 bears at his home in @entity19 the couple moved into this four - bedroom home having found their three - bedroom terrace was too small for their ever growing collection of teddy bears the couple , who give each bear its own name , recently moved house to accommodate their large collection , which they have amassed over the past 23 years and estimate to be worth £ 4,500			1
mr @entity15 , a former product manager , said some people could not understand why they would spend their money on cuddly toys			1
‘ our friends think we have more money than sense , but we love our bears so much , ' he said			2
‘ we ’ve had to move just to fit them all in			2
in our previous place it was getting to be a tight squeeze but it ’s less cluttered now			2
‘ we ’ve unpacked them all and they seem to be loving their new home			1
‘ one of the hardest things about moving house was having to pack them all into plastic bags			2
we felt awful doing it , it just did n’t feel right			2
’ the couple , who do n’t have any children , began collecting teddy bears in 1991 following the death of their pet golden @entity59 , @entity62			1
@entity3 sits among a plethora of bears in one of the bedrooms at his home they name and photograph each one and record when and where it was purchased in a detailed computerised log book			1
in october they decided to move from their three - bedroom terraced home in @entity78 , @entity79 , to a larger house in @entity19 to accommodate their massive brood of soft toys			1
they have so many that every room of their new property is filled with different types of bears			2
‘ while we had the dog we could n’t really start collecting the bears as he would have had them , ’ said 60 - year - old mr @entity15			1
mr @entity15 cuddles up to their first ever bear , @entity96 , which they bought following the death of their dog @entity3 in the lounge of his new home having relocated with his wife @entity103 to accommodate the collection ‘ but after he died we bought a teddy , sort of as a replacement pet , and from there we just carried on			1
it was n’t really a conscious thing , but now , 20 years later we have hundreds			1
‘ we get the bears from all over the place			2
gifts from friends and family , places we visit , holidays abroad , markets , auction houses and the high street			0
‘ they are a real mixed bag and are all very unique			0
we have some that cost a couple of pounds from charity shops to others worth a few hundred			1
‘ the most expensive is @entity128 , he was bought for my wife as a present when she worked for the council			0
we think he is worth about £ 260			1
‘ we do n’t buy designer ones like @entity133 ’s as they are very expensive but we have got some lovely bears from @entity135 and @entity136			0
’ the many boxes the couple used to transport more than 600 teddy bears from their former home in @entity78 to their new house in @entity19 mr and mrs @entity4 named this bear @entity142 , the smallest in their collection , which they bought from @entity148 mr @entity15 said he and his wife love the bears so much they are ‘ like family '			1
‘ one of the first ones we ever got was a @entity135 bear called mischief , ’ he said			0
‘ the largest is a three feet tall bear called @entity157			0
we got him in @entity158 and had to bring him back on the train			0
he was so big he needed his own seat			0
‘ they have pride of place in the lounge and the kitchen , while the dining room and bedrooms are full of them too			0
people who come to visit think we ’re mad			0
‘ when we have guests we do n’t move them or put them away			0
our friends have to sit around them , but they love it			0
they ’re always posing for pictures with them			0
’ mrs @entity4 , 63 , who until recently worked as an administrator for her local museum service , added : ‘ we never had any children of our own but i would n’t say they were our fur - kids			1
‘ they are just incredibly well - loved bears			2
i think they all have such different beautiful faces			0
’ @entity90 started in 1903 when a cartoon appeared in an @entity180 newspaper depicting @entity180 president @entity181 ( @entity90 ) @entity182 refusing to shoot a bear cub that was tied to a tree			0
soon after , an enterprising novelty shop owner in @entity186 made some toy bears and sold them as @entity188 .			0

@entity3 and @entity4 have amassed more than 600 teddies of all sizes
@entity193 began collecting the stuffed toys 23 years *ago* after death of dog
