by @entity0 published : 00:52 est , 24 june 2012 updated : 06:25 est , 24 june 2012 @entity1 skipped out of state this spring rather than attend drug treatment and follow other conditions he accepted to avoid prison after pleading guilty to robbery in 2010			1
but rather do everything possible to avoid detection , he used @entity10 to taunt his probation officer and write angry messages about the @entity14 judge who sentenced him , @entity7 reported			1
' fresh out of another state , ' @entity1 wrote april 20 , ' catch me if you can			1
' later , he signed a rant about the criminal justice system : ' the 1 who got away			0
' @entity10 flub : convicted robber @entity1 posted status updates of his whereabouts , which were read by police @entity1 apparently did n't realize who might be reading his @entity10 page , with such posts as , ' i 'm in @entity30			1
' he also posted a sonogram of his unborn son that showed the name of the county general hospital in @entity30 where it was taken			1
but probation officer @entity36 does monitor the social network and he collected the posts			0
he figured out where @entity1 might be , and asked prosecutors to issue a nationwide arrest warrant , which @entity42 gov. @entity41 signed			1
' the way we found out where @entity1 was , was through @entity10 , ' deputy district attorney @entity43 said			1
' and , it 's not because we were super sleuths			0
' last month , @entity1 was arrested for speeding in @entity48 , @entity30			1
an officer ran his license and found the warrant			0
antisocial network : he was sentenced to two and a half years in jail and must repay the state of @entity42 the cost of his flight back soon , he was on a flight to appear before the same judge he had criticized on @entity10			2
' mr. @entity1 , ' judge @entity59 said at a june 8 hearing in @entity61			2
' you turned in some good periods of performance			0
and then , for whatever reason , you decided that you had had enough , and you just took off , and you never looked back			0
' @entity1 , in tears , pleaded for leniency			2
' sir , you could have stayed here and done treatment			0
you decided to run away			0
so how could you now be asking for me to give you another chance to avoid prison ? ' crying , @entity1 admitted , ' i messed up			2
' @entity59 sentenced him to 2 1/2 years in prison and ordered him to reimburse the state for the cost of flying him back : $ 2,600 .			0
