by @entity1 reporter published : 09:52 est , 4 december 2012 updated : 12:26 est , 4 december 2012 there 's nothing worse than having unexpected guests arrive when you have n't got any food in - so perhaps it 's no surprise this eagle got a cool reception when it gate - crashed this gathering of cranes			2
the bird of prey did n't have a prayer if it thought it could steal some of the food the cranes had managed to scavenge in the snow			2
normally used to being the predator , the eagle clearly did n't like having the tables turned , and flew away to safety			0
where eagle dares : the birds clash in mid-air as the crane defends its food feathered friends ... and enemies : outnumbered three to one , the eagle is soon forced to flee the scene sorry - must fly ! having done its best to ruin the cranes ' meal , the eagle makes its getaway ... but not without crashing into one of its rivals @entity39 photographer @entity38 , 41 , was on hand to snap the white tailed eagle attempt to take on a flock of @entity39 red crowned cranes in @entity46 , southern @entity39			1
the snow fall came as bad news for these birds as the berries and fish they normally eat were covered , leaving them to battle against each other for whatever they could find			1
the cranes blended in against the backdrop but a beautiful red colouring on the top of their heads helped them to stand out against the snow			1
the amateur photographer , who has been dabbling with photography for the past eight years , said : ' it was really interesting to watch these birds and see how they responded to each other during the battle			0
' i was amazed and surprised to see how brave the cranes were when they defended themselves			0
' it 's usually the eagles who end up stealing fish so i was glad that the cranes came out top on this one and had a chance for them to get their own back			1
' bird brain : the eagle did n't give up straight away and made several attempts to steal food from the cranes before taking the hint watch the birdie : the battle is over and the eagle flies away , defeated			0
