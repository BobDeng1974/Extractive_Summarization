they are tiny eight legged mites , related to spiders and look rather like an ice cream cone with stubby legs at one end			2
yet although you may not recognise , scientists say they are living on your face right now			0
a new study found the mites , invisible to the naked eye , in 100 % of the people they tested			1
our skin is home to two different species of mites : @entity27 and @entity28 is slightly shorter and rounder , and spends most of its life nestled deeply inside a hair follicle sebum ( oil ) gland			1
@entity33 live more shallowly in the hair follicle called @entity36 , they live in our hair follicles , buried head - down , eating the oils we secrete. , human faces host two species of mites -- @entity27 and @entity43 -- and they are n't that close of relatives			1
@entity47 , a graduate student at @entity48 , told @entity49			0
' they 're actually pretty cute			0
' with their eight little legs , they look like they 're almost swimming through the oil			0
' ' it 's like having friends with you all the time , ' @entity47 says			0
' realizing that everyone has them and they 're likely not causing any problems , it 's pretty reassuring			0
' in dna tests of 29 people , 100 percent of those over age 18 carried dna from @entity36 mites , the team found in their study in the journal @entity73			1
tests on more people have also come up with the same 100 percent number , @entity47 says			2
scientists do n't know how the mites spread among humans ; one theory is that they 're passed on from mother to child while breast - feeding			1
young people are much less likely to have them , while they 've been found on almost all cadavers			2
the mites probably crawl on our faces at night , when it 's dark			1
@entity33 live more shallowly in the hair follicle @entity36 have likely been living with us for a long , long time ; as early humans walked out of @entity93 and found their way around the globe , the researchers say			1
they found that mites from @entity97 are genetically distinct from mites from the @entity99			1
@entity100 and @entity102 populations diverged over 40,000 years ago and so far it looks like their mites did as well			0
' @entity36 have likely been living with us for a long , long time ; as early humans walked out of @entity93 and found their way around the globe , they probably carried their mites with them , ' said @entity107 , adjunct assistant professor of entomology at @entity48 and @entity109 of @entity110 at the @entity111			1
' so we want to know if @entity112 can provide a reflection of our own evolutionary history by allowing us to retrace those ancient paths of human migration			0
' one of the most intriguing ( and unsolved ) face mite mysteries is how humans acquired these beasties			0
' perhaps these mites are a model system of co-evolution			0
it ’s possible that as every species of mammal evolved , so did their mites – each one particularly adapted to its changed environs			2

called @entity36 , they live in our hair follicles , buried head - down , eating the oils we secrete .
human faces host two species of mites - @entity27 and @entity43
researchers found 100 % of faces they examined had the mites
