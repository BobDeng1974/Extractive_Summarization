a desperate mother has to watch in horror as her daughter becomes paralysed every other day			1
@entity3 , 39 , watches while her daughter is unable to move a single bone in her body for up to 19 hours at a time			0
in this state ms @entity3 's daughter , @entity7 , can only cry out for help and wait until drugs help her regain movement			1
mrs @entity3 said : ' when it happens , it is absolutely horrendous			0
my little girl goes from being an energetic youngster to being trapped in a body that ca n't move			0
' it is awful to watch			0
her eyes are full of fear as she desperately waits to feel any form of sensation again			0
' @entity3 , 39 , has to watch helplessly as her daughter , @entity7 , 12 , becomes paralysed every other day to a rare genetic condition @entity7 has hypokalemic periodic paralysis which means she has periods where she ca n't move her body and has to be rushed to hospital ( pictured ) @entity7 , who is just 12 , suffered her first petrifying episode of paralysis in january this year			1
ms @entity3 , a nurse , said : ' she had woken up in the night complaining she could n't feel her arm			0
i just thought she had slept on it and it had gone numb			0
' but by the morning , @entity7 said she could n't feel her arms or legs			1
initially i thought she was winding me up and trying to get the day off school because it was snowing			2
' it was only when she could n't sit up , or even move , that i realised she was telling the truth			0
' i knew she had n't had a stroke as her face was n't sloping but i knew something very serious was wrong			0
' i used a needle to prick her fingers and toes and she did n't flinch a single inch			0
i felt absolutely terrible for doubting her			0
i could see she was desperately trying to move her arms and legs but could n't			0
' i immediately dialled the @entity50 helpline who sent for an ambulance			0
' it was only as paramedics were carrying out an @entity55 and checking her blood pressure and airways that it struck me what was wrong			0
hypokalemic periodic paralysis is a disorder that causes occasional episodes of muscle weakness and sometimes a lower than normal level of potassium in the blood			1
the condition is caused by a mutation on chromosome 17			2
in most cases , it is passed down through families ( inherited ) as an autosomal dominant disorder			2
in other words , only one parent needs to pass the gene related to this condition on to you in order for you to be affected			2
symptoms include attacks of muscle weakness or loss of muscle movement ( paralysis ) that come and go			1
there is normal muscle strength between attacks			2
attacks usually begin in the teen years , but they can occur before age 10			0
how often the attacks occur varies			0
some people have attacks every day			2
others have them once a year			0
during attacks the person remains alert			2
the weakness or paralysis : other symptoms may include : source : @entity100 ' my ex-husband , @entity7 's dad , and her grandad , also suffered from a condition that intermittently left them paralysed			1
' the extremely rare and potentially fatal condition , hypokalemic periodic paralysis , is caused by dangerously low levels of potassium			1
it took four paramedics to safely lift @entity7 , who had become a dead weight , onto a back board and into an ambulance			1
after initially being taken to @entity118 general @entity116 , she was rushed 20 miles to @entity119			2
it was there her potassium levels were checked and results showed they were extremely low and a neurologist , dr @entity124 , diagnosed @entity7 with the debilitating condition			1
@entity7 was given potassium intravenously , but only after an agonising 14 hours , did she slowly regain movement			1
ms @entity3 , a single mother , from @entity118 , @entity128 said : ' we were both just so relived			0
i never thought i 'd be so happy to see @entity7 wriggle her fingers and toes			1
' it is something you just take for granted , never imagining your child will literally freeze in her sleep , and lose sensation of almost every muscle from her neck down			1
' over the following week , @entity7 fell into a state of paralysis every other day , each time it starting in her sleep			1
ms @entity3 , 39 , said : ' every second morning she would wake up unable to move			0
each time we were terrified			0
' all we could do was wait for the iv potassium to flow through her body and pray it would take effect			1
' the condition , caused by mutation of chromosome 17 , only effects one person in every 100,000 and is far more common in men than women			1
ms @entity3 continued : ' that 's why it never initially occurred to me that 's what @entity7 had			1
her dad had always told me it was a condition that affected males , not females , but obviously it does happen in girls too			1
' although @entity7 's attacks have slowed down to every couple of weeks at the moment , we have been warned the bouts of paralysis can happen at any time and could get more frequent			1
they generally happen when she is sleeping			2
' if it happens when she is awake , @entity7 starts to slowly feel a tingling sensation in her fingers and she knows it 's about to happen , and can take a form of potassium syrup to stop it developing			1
' but when it starts in her sleep , she has no idea , and wakes up completely paralysed			1
' it has had a devastating effect on our lives			0
i ca n't allow @entity7 to sleep over at friend 's houses , something girls her age take for granted , or go on an overnight school trip without me in case she has an attack			1
' as soon as it happens we have to get her straight to hospital in an ambulance so she can be treated immediately			2
if we do n't we could lose @entity7			1
@entity7 's attacks usually occur in her sleep , and she wakes up paralysed			1
her mother must feed her , wash her and put a bed pan underneath her			0
in between attacks she can move normally @entity7 was once paralysed for 19 hours			1
she finds relying on her mother difficult as she wants to be independent			0
she can not stay at her friends houses in case she has an attack in her sleep ' when it initially started i asked the consultant if it could be fatal , it broke my heart when he said yes			2
it 's is horrendous to think i could lose my daughter			0
it 's every parent 's worst nightmare			0
' it 's very hard watching her go to sleep			2
i often check on her two or three times a night to see if she is moving			0
' every morning the first thing i do is check she can move hers arms and legs , only then do i breathe a sigh of relief			0
' but of course there are times when she wakes up and is frozen to her bed			2
she is like a statue , completely still apart from her face			2
' the longest episode @entity7 has suffered has lasted 19 hours			1
ms @entity3 said : ' during that time i have to feed her , wash her and put her on a bed pan			0
' it 's very frustrating for her			0
she 's a young girl , just about to hit her teenage years and does n't want to feel so out of control and dependant on me			0
' she tries her best to put on a brave face but i know it 's extremely hard for her			0
' and because @entity7 is up and about a lot of the time and maintains a normal lifestyle as such , people do not realise how poorly she is and the severity of her illness			1
' it can be a fatal if we do n't act quickly			0
' ms @entity3 and her daughter have no idea what the future holds and how much the condition will take over their lives			2
but they are taking each day as it comes and trying to remain positive			2
during an attack , ms @entity3 is rushed to hospital where she is treated with potassium through an @entity261 ( she is pictured in hospital , left and right ) ms @entity3 added : ' we just have to take it in our stride and hope that we can manage the condition			1
' she is now fundraising for the @entity269 appeal , to build a new wing including plenty of private bedrooms so families can stay together at difficult times			0
when @entity7 was in hospital , ms @entity3 kept vigil at her bedside , sleeping in a high - back chair			1
in the new wing , she would have her own pull - down bed , @entity7 would have more privacy , and would get better more quickly in a hospital designed with children in mind			1
@entity286 , director at @entity287 , said : ' @entity7 is an inspirational girl , fighting a terrifying illness with such bravery			1
' we are so lucky to have the specialist consultants at our hospital , such as dr @entity124 , who can help treat and control this condition			1
' that is why we need to raise money for this appeal , to keep our specialist services special and bring world - class facilities to our already world - class hospital			2

@entity7 , 12 , has a genetic disorder called hypokalemic periodic paralysis
causes muscle weakness and she becomes paralysed every other day
has to be rushed to hospital where she is given potassium via an iv drip
episodes often happen in her sleep and she wakes completely paralysed
condition is genetic and only affects one person in every 100,000
