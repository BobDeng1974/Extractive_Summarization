they ’re a firm favourite on dinner - plates across the country , and a friday - night cod would n’t be the same without them			0
but the humble chip is a food we take for granted – scoffing 382 million portions every year ; fried , oven - cooked , fat ones , crinkly ones , curly ones , @entity14 ones			2
so what does it take to cook the perfect chip ? this is something top chefs ponder to make this moreish sidedish retain its crown as one of @entity24 ’s best - loved foods			1
executive chef @entity30 tells me to start by peeling the potato and cut it lengthways into three slices , at least 1cm thick			1
the slices are then cut three across , leaving me with a neat pile of nine thick , evenly - cut chips			0
we ’re using @entity34 potatoes instead of @entity52 or @entity53 as chef @entity30 is convinced it is the best tuber for chips			1
‘ we ’ve tested 27 varieties of potato before we finally settled on this one , ’ he said			0
the @entity34 , which used to only be grown in @entity59 , is now grown in @entity35			1
‘ while @entity52 have long thought to be the perfect chip potato , they can sometimes be inconsistent , ’ he said			1
‘ the @entity34 however delivers 52 weeks of the year			1
’ peel the potatoes ( left ) lengthways into three slices , at least 1cm thick ( right ) to remove excess starch , the potatoes are given two cold baths			2
they are then carefully drained the chips are fried in 150 ° c oil for exactly six minutes before they are drained ( left )			0
they then have to rest for a minimum of two hours so that the sugars in the potato settle ( right ) the potatoes are given two cold baths , which removes excess starch from them			2
next they are thoroughly drained , with chef @entity30 exhorting me to shake the basket to get rid of as much water as possible			1
the deep - fat fryer is heated to 150 ° c and the chips get their first fry			0
chef @entity30 watches closely as i dip the chip basket into the fryer and he urges me to give it a little shake so all the chips are cooked evenly			1
the chips are left to fry for exactly six minutes before i am allowed to take them out of the oil			0
i get ready to salt them but am surprised when he tells me to step away			0
‘ we have to leave them to grow cold , ’ he says , revealing that the chips are left to rest for a minimum of two hours so that the sugar content settles down , before they are fried again			0
when it comes to refrying the chips , they are swiftly plunged into 190 ° c oil			0
without a timer i have to keep a close eye on the chip , making sure that they do n’t overcook or get burnt			2
finally chef @entity30 is satisfied with the way my chips look and instructs me to take them out of the fat			1
‘ can you hear the sound they make ? that ’s how you know they ’re done , ’ he says to me as the golden chips tumble out of their basket and into the bowl			2
i salt them , shaking the container around as i do that , so their surface is evenly coated			0
decanted in their chip cups , chef @entity30 gets first taste and nods in approval when he bites into one , slathering it in vinegar while i recklessly dip mine in ketchup			1
' vinegar is the best condiment for a chip , ' the chef says as he looks on in disapproval			1
crunchy on the outside and soft and fluffy within , i 'm pleased with my first attempt at making a chip and vow to never eat a frozen fry again			2
who needs to when it 's this easy to make your own ? after a second fry the golden - brown chips are tumbled out into a container and are then salted ketchup or vinegar ? while chef @entity30 opts for the latter , the writer chooses to dip her chip in ketchup almost 700,000 tonnes of potatoes are made into fresh chips in @entity24 every year – that ’s 333 times heavier than the @entity159 over 328 million portions of fish and chip meals are sold in the @entity163 each year the average spend in a fish and chip shop is £ 3.21 – less than half the average price us @entity166 splash out on a takeaway curry			1
@entity171 food is around 46 % more expensive than a meal from the chippy , while a pizza is 47 % more expensive			0
using the right spuds for chips can make all the difference - to ensure your chips are lovely and fluffy try @entity179 or @entity182 potatoes			1
