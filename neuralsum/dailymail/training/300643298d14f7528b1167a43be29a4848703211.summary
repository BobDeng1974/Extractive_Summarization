the defence secretary said there was a ' a bit of rethinking ' about soldier numbers after military commanders reported that @entity5 forces were taking on the ' lion 's share ' of the combat role			1
@entity4 forces have shut down 52 of their bases and checkpoints in @entity21 over he past six months , leaving just 34 still operating , he said			1
@entity22 today backed mr @entity2 , saying @entity23 had already made clear that he wants more troops home in 2013			2
but a @entity26 spokesman insisted no final decisions have yet been taken			0
' the prime minister said in july that he was confident that he would be able to reduce troop numbers further next year , following conversations with commanders on the ground , ' the spokesman added			0
the pm has stressed the need to avoid a ' cliff - edge ' on troop withdrawal in 2014 , the date when all @entity4 combat troops are due to be out			1
but he has insisted the decision should be based on progress by the @entity5 security forces			2
mr @entity2 admitted @entity4 officers had been privately pushing ' for keeping force levels as high as possible for as long as possible ' earlier this year			2
but military commanders had since been ' surprised by the extent to which they have been able to draw back and leave the @entity5 to take the lion 's share of the combat role ' , he added			1
in an interview with the @entity48 in @entity49 , @entity21 , he said : ' i think there is a bit of a rethinking going on about how many troops we do actually need ... ' there may be some scope for a little bit more flexibility on the way we draw down , and that is something commanders on the ground are looking at very actively			0
' around 500 @entity4 troops are due to return home by the end of this year , leaving a further 9,000 to return by the end of 2014			1
mr @entity2 added : ' i think that the message i am getting clearly from the military is that it might be possible to draw down further troops in 2013			0
' whereas six months ago the message coming from them was that we really need to hold on to everything we have got for as long as we possibly can			0
i think they are seeing potentially more flexibility in the situation			0
' talking to senior commanders you get a clear sense that their view of force levels is evolving in light of their experiences			0
' a @entity4 soldier watches as a @entity88 lands in @entity5 : mr @entity2 said we can not expect our troops to risk their lives to build a better life for @entity5 the defence secretary insisted @entity4 would not be ' spooked ' by the run of ' green on blue ' attacks - when @entity5 turn on international troops			1
he added : ' we have to be clear why we came here in the first place			0
i believe very clearly that if we are going to ask @entity4 troops to put themselves in the firing line , we can only do that to protect @entity4 vital national security interests			1
' we can ask troops who are here to help build a better @entity5 , but we can not ask them to expose themselves to risk for those tasks			0
' we can only ask them to expose themselves to risk for @entity4 's national security , which is what they signed up to do			0
' in order for their to be resolution to the conflict , @entity4 would have accept that ' @entity117 - style ' negotiations would have to be made with at least moderate elements within the @entity5 insurgency , he said			1
but he said that the @entity5 government 's diplomatic efforts with insurgents were lagging behind successes in the military campaign			2
mr @entity2 also raised concerns about the potential for the unrest that sparked the murder of the @entity130 ambassador in @entity131 to spread to @entity5 and revealed extra steps had been taken to strengthen security around @entity4 bases .			2
