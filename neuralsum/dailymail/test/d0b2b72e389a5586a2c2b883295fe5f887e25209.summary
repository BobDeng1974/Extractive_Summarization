with a possible 11 games left to their season @entity8 ’s front three of @entity3 , @entity4 and @entity5 are just seven goals short of clocking up a century in their first season together			1
the three amigos will match the total scored by @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity3 in 2009 if they reach 100 goals and they will inevitably fuel the debate that they are fast becoming the greatest front three in @entity8 ’s history			1
@entity11 scored 26 , @entity19 and @entity3 38 goals in the 2008 - 09 season			1
in this campaign @entity3 has 46 , @entity5 and @entity22 despite missing the first three months through suspension			0
they scored 98 goals in the 2010 - 11 season with @entity3 getting 53 , @entity56 23 and @entity50 21			1
both attacks had a tendency to come good in the @entity59 with the @entity11 / @entity44 / @entity3 strikeforce playing in one of the most famous @entity38 - @entity8 games of all time in 2009 with @entity8 winning 6 - 2 at the @entity64 and @entity11 and @entity3 both scored twice			1
@entity3 celebrates with @entity11 after @entity8 won the @entity45 in 2009 the @entity65 congratulates team - mate @entity12 after he scores in the @entity45 final in 2009 the current combination lacks the @entity45 the other two have and a big win over @entity38 but there is still time for them to combine the two with a @entity72 final still a possibility			1
when they first came together at the start of the season there was the fear among @entity8 supporters that the team would not be big enough for the three of them			0
@entity8 legend @entity83 had already warned a year early that ‘ a ship can not have two captains ’ and that @entity5 and @entity3 would not get on			2
when @entity4 was introduced that was , for some , another reason to believe @entity88 would have problems			0
but nothing could have been further from the truth			0
@entity4 has had his fair share of highly controversial incidents but has never been a bad influence in the dressing room			0
in monday ’s training session at @entity8 ’s @entity97 he received a playful knee between the legs from @entity5 in a light - hearted training session ahead of tonight ’s game			2
his relationship with the @entity103 is good ; and with @entity3 ’s it ’s even better			0
after a slow start to his @entity8 career @entity4 has now scored 19 goals despite missing the first months of the season through suspension @entity3 celebrates with @entity4 after the @entity110 international netted against @entity29 @entity3 never saw eye to eye with @entity51 or @entity47 and both were put out at times at having to play second fiddle to the four times @entity116 winner but after a season accommodating @entity119 's preference for playing through the middle , the demands of @entity3 have not been a problem for @entity4			1
the training - ground chemistry has been good and has translated on to the pitch			0
goals statistics aside @entity8 have always boasted brilliant front threes			0
@entity3 was first thrust into a forward line that boasted @entity127 and @entity12 and they won the @entity45 in 2004 against @entity129			2
@entity130 , @entity131 and @entity132 was @entity83 ’s @entity8 front three in the 1993 - 94 season but their time together was brief and they never won the @entity45 – losing 4 - 0 to @entity138 with @entity131 on the bench			2
if this season ends with @entity3 , @entity4 and @entity5 smashing the 100 goals barrier and lifting the trophy in @entity143 no other forward line in @entity8 ’s history will be able to touch them .			1

@entity3 , @entity4 and @entity5 have scored 93 goals this season
@entity3 , @entity11 and @entity12 scored 100 goals in 2008 - 09 season
the trio will attempt to steer @entity8 into @entity45 *semi-final*
@entity88 's side hold a 3 - 1 *advantage* from the *quarter* - final first leg
