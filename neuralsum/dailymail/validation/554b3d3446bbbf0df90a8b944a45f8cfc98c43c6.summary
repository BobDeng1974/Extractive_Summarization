for a child , the world is a heady mix of colours , shapes and words that are constantly being learned and remembered			0
to make sense of many of these experiences , babies and toddlers ' map ' names to objects by assessing their surroundings and associating words with the item 's location			1
and now a new study has found that this association is not only affected by the child 's proximity to the object , it can also be influenced by their specific posture			1
when the target and another object were placed in the location , and the robot was positioned in a different way , it failed to recognise the object cognitive scientists from @entity27 began by assessing the learning capabilities of a child - like robot called @entity42			1
they showed the robot an object situated to its left , and a different object on its right			2
this was repeated so @entity42 learnt to associate between the objects and its two related postures			1
the robot consistently made a link between the object and its name - and proved this by reaching for the object - during 20 repeats of the experiment			2
but in subsequent tests where the target and another object were placed in both locations and the robot was positioned in a different way , it failed to recognise the object			2
this experiment was replicated using children aged 12 to 18 months and the researchers noticed only ' slight differences ' in the results			2
as with the robot , the infants failed to recognise objects if their position and posture changed , or the object was moved			1
in steps 1 to 4 , objects are placed left or right and are given names			2
in step 5 of the @entity76 , the objects are hidden while in the @entity78 , their location is switched			1
the items are put back in their correct location in 6 and 7 before being moved again in step 8			0
the participant is then asked to identify an object this experiment was replicated using children aged 12 to 18 months ( stock image ) and the researchers noticed only ' slight differences in the results			1
' like with the robot , the infants failed to recognise objects if their position and posture changed , or the object was moved the study was carried out by @entity95 , a professor in the @entity96			1
she worked with @entity97 , a senior post-doctoral research fellow in the @entity98 at the @entity99 and @entity100 , a post-doctoral research associate at the @entity101			0
' this study shows that the body plays a role in early object name learning , and how toddlers use the body 's position in space to connect ideas , ' professor @entity95 said			1
' the creation of a robot model for infant learning has far - reaching implications for how the brains of young people work			0
' a number of studies suggest that memory is tightly tied to the location of an object			1
' none , however , have shown that bodily position plays a role or that , if you shift your body , you could forget			0

' the creation of a robot model for infant learning ( @entity42 pictured ) ) has far - reaching implications for how the brains of young people work ' the humanoid called @entity42 has been under development for 10 years			1
it is motivated by goals and can express six emotions on its face , including raising its eyebrows and generating a light - up smile			0
it was originally created by the @entity145 as part of the @entity147 and has since been refined to crawl , walk and dance to music , manipulate objects in its hands , speak and express emotions			0
the robot 's goals and emotions change constantly , based on information picked up by sensors and it reacts appropriately a video recently posted by @entity160 shows it playing a game of paddle war – a simple game where two players each hold a paddle - or in this case a cylinder - and try to score goals using a digital ball , while stopping their rival from scoring			0
the robot 's goals and emotions change constantly , based on information picked up by sensors and it reacts appropriately to whether it is winning or losing			0
when @entity42 concedes a goal , it frowns and furrows its light - up eyebrows , sometimes swearing like an ill - tempered human			1
when it scores a goal , it smiles and says phrases like ' got it , ' although there is not much change in intonation whether a phrase is negative or positive			0
the video also shows how the robot can respond to being touched , a little bit like a slightly creepy human			0
when a human strokes its arms it affects @entity42 's reactions and emotions and the robot says on one occasion in the video : ' i like when you touch me this way '			1
tweaks to its software also mean that the robot is starting to understand language and can follow instructions that require reasoning , such as identifying two objects and moving them to a position , as instructed			0
she added that the experiments could provide a new way to investigate how cognition is connected to the body , as well as new evidence that thoughts , words and representations of objects are affected by the ' spatial relationship of the body within the surrounding world			0
' the research , ' posture affects how robots and @entity223 to objects , ' is published in the journal @entity226			1
professor @entity95 said additional research is needed to determine whether this study 's results apply to just infants , or more broadly to the relationship between the brain , the body and memory			2
the study may also help learn more about developmental disorders , difficulties with motor coordination and cognitive development			0

babies learn the name of new objects by ' mapping ' their surroundings
this means they associate a word using the object 's proximity to them
@entity264 said this applies to their *physical* location as well as their posture
researchers used a humanoid called @entity42 and infants to test this theory
