by @entity0 and @entity1 captured : a solider , his face obscured for legal reasons , guards an @entity5 taxpayers face a bill of more than £ 31million for the public inquiry focused on false allegations that @entity11 troops murdered @entity5 prisoners of war and mutilated their bodies			1
defence secretary @entity15 yesterday disclosed the enlarged estimate of the cost of the controversial @entity19 inquiry			2
it came seven weeks after lawyers representing @entity5 families withdrew their central claim that soldiers had killed unarmed civilians			2
at that stage , the cost was given officially at £ 23million , but mr @entity15 said in a @entity29 answer that it was now expected to reach £ 31.1million – more than four times the figure for the @entity32 inquiry into the @entity5 war itself			1
almost a quarter of the overall figure is for barristers ’ and other legal fees , with £ 2.8million going to @entity40 solicitor @entity39 ’s @entity38			0
the firm represented @entity5 detainees and their families , some of whose evidence was discredited and said to have been ‘ fabricated ’			2
last night @entity5 veteran colonel @entity46 , whose @entity48 troops played a pivotal role in capturing @entity50 , condemned the action			1
‘ it is right and proper that the @entity53 is held to high standards , but the allegations that have been brought are tenuous at best , ’ he said			0
‘ it is an abuse of the system			0
the only losers are justice and the taxpayer			0
’ the collapse of the central claims at the inquiry will focus new scrutiny on the cases of more than 1,500 @entity5 who claim they are the victims of @entity11 abuse and who are being represented by @entity71			1
many of the cases are understood to be paid for by the taxpayer			0
no breakdown of the latest estimate given by mr @entity15 is available , but figures released at the end of april showed the cost was £ 23,149,476 , with the largest bill – £ 7,077,422 – being for investigative and other expert services			1
investigators , including 12 former @entity84 detectives , were paid as much as £ 1,000 a day to probe the unfounded allegations			2
@entity5 veteran colonel @entity46 , pictured , whose @entity48 troops played a pivotal role in capturing @entity50 , condemned the action and said ' the only losers are justice and the taxpayer ' they travelled on business class flights , staying in five - star hotels in the @entity93 , so they could interview potential witnesses			1
barristers ’ and other legal costs were £ 5,131,108			0
it is ten years today since the firefight – known as the @entity100 after a @entity11 checkpoint near @entity102 , north of @entity50 – that sparked the allegations at the centre of the @entity106 inquiry			1
it took its name from @entity110 , 19 , an @entity5 allegedly killed by @entity11 troops			1
around 100 insurgents ambushed a patrol of @entity11 soldiers and during a three - hour battle 28 @entity5 were said to have been killed and several soldiers injured , none fatally			2
it led to claims that 20 or more @entity5 taken prisoner during the battle were murdered and their bodies mutilated , and that nine others were tortured			1
defence secretary @entity15 , pictured , has disclosed the enlarged estimate of the cost of the controversial @entity19 inquiry but the case made to the inquiry sensationally fell apart when lawyers for the @entity5 admitted there was no evidence in the central claim – that insurgents were murdered and their bodies mutilated			1
it provoked outrage that @entity11 troops were accused of the most serious crimes by publicly - funded lawyers			0
lawyers for the troops and @entity139 said accusations of war crimes were ‘ manifestly untrue ’			2
@entity5 witnesses ‘ dishonestly ’ fabricated claims because of an ‘ ulterior motive in the form of financial compensation ’ , they claimed			0
but lawyers for the @entity5 said there were still numerous ‘ grave ’ claims of abuse to consider			0
the inquiry is also looking at allegations of abuse , torture and mistreatment of the nine @entity5 by @entity11 forces			1
after sitting for more than 42 weeks it has finished hearing evidence and is expected to report by the end of the year			0
a spokesman for the inquiry said it is ‘ focused on obtaining value for money ’			0
she added : ‘ it was the investigators doing such an extensive job that led to these claims being withdrawn			0

£ 31m bill for inquiry on false allegations troops murdered @entity5 prisoners
@entity106 inquiry cost is four times more than inquiry into @entity5 war itself
