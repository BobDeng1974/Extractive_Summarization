by @entity0 in a first , working - age people now make up the majority in @entity4 households that rely on food stamps - a switch from a few years ago , when children and the elderly were the main @entity9 of the change is due to demographics , such as the trend toward having fewer children			1
but a slow economic recovery with high unemployment , stagnant wages and an increasing gulf between low - wage and high - skill jobs also plays a big role			0
it suggests that government spending on the $ 80 billion - a - year food stamp program - twice what it cost five years ago - may not subside significantly anytime soon			1
working poor : working - age people now need state food benefits more than any other group food stamp participation since 1980 has grown the fastest among workers with some college training , a sign that the safety net has stretched further to cover @entity4 's former middle class , according to an analysis of government data for @entity0 by economists at the @entity37			1
formally called @entity39 , or @entity40 , the program now covers one in seven @entity4			0
the findings coincide with the latest economic data showing workers ' wages and salaries growing at the lowest rate relative to corporate profits in @entity4 history			0
president @entity51 's @entity50 address tuesday night is expected to focus in part on reducing income inequality , such as by raising the federal minimum wage			1
safety net : low wage workers are finding it increasingly difficult to make ends meet @entity59 , meanwhile , is debating cuts to food stamps , with republicans including @entity64 majority leader @entity63 , @entity65 , wanting a $ 4 billion - a - year reduction to an anti-poverty program that they say promotes dependency and abuse			1
economists say having a job may no longer be enough for self - sufficiency in today 's economy			0
' a low - wage job supplemented with food stamps is becoming more common for the working poor , ' said @entity77 , an economics professor at the @entity78 who specializes in income inequality			1
' many of the @entity4 jobs now being created are low - or minimum - wage - part - time or in areas such as retail or fast food - which means food stamp use will stay high for some time , even after unemployment improves			1
' the newer food stamp recipients include @entity89 , 25 , of @entity90 , @entity91			2
a high school graduate , she enrolled in college but did n't complete her nursing degree after she could no longer afford the tuition			0
hoping to boost her credentials , she went through emergency medical technician training with the @entity98 last year but was unable to find work as a paramedic because of the additional certification and fees required			0
enrolled : @entity89 poses for a photograph with her three - year - old daughter , @entity105 , at @entity106 in @entity107 , @entity91 on saturday @entity89 , now the mother of a three - year - old daughter , finally took a job as a home health aide , working six days a week at $ 10 an hour			1

' it 's devastating , ' @entity89 said			0
' when i left for the @entity98 i was so motivated , thinking i was creating a situation where i could give my daughter what i know she deserves			0
but when i came back and basically found myself in the same situation , it was like it was all for naught			0
' since 2009 , more than 50 per cent of @entity4 households receiving food stamps have been adults ages 18 to 59 , according to the @entity131 's @entity130			1
the food stamp program defines non-elderly adults as anyone younger than 60			0
as recently as 1998 , the working - age share of food stamp households was at a low of 44 per cent , before the dot - com bust and subsequent recessions in 2001 and 2007 pushed new enrollees into the program , according to the analysis by @entity143 , director of the @entity144 at the @entity37			1
by education , about 28 per cent of food stamp households are headed by a person with at least some college training , up from eight per cent in 1980			2

she enrolled in the food stamps program to help save up for paramedic training while she works as a home health aide and raises her three - year - old daughter high - school graduates head the bulk of food stamp households at 37 per cent , up from 28 per cent			1
in contrast , food stamp households headed by a high - school dropout have dropped by more than half , to 28 per cent			2
the shifts in food stamp participation come amid broader changes to the economy such as automation , globalization and outsourcing , which have polarized the job market			0
many well - paying jobs in areas such as manufacturing have disappeared , shrinking the @entity4 middle class and bumping people with higher levels of education into lower - wage work			0
an analysis @entity143 conducted for the @entity0 finds that stagnant wages and income inequality play an increasing role in the growth of food stamp rolls			1
taking into account changing family structure , higher unemployment and policy expansions to the food stamp program , the analysis shows that stagnant wages and income inequality explained just 3.5 per cent of the change in food stamp enrollment from 1980 to 2011			1
but from 2000 to 2011 , wages and inequality accounted for 13 per cent of the increase			0
providing for the future : @entity89 wants to find better - paid work so that she can give her daughter ' what she deserves ' several economists say food stamp rolls are likely to remain elevated for some time			2
historically , there has been a lag before an improving unemployment rate leads to a substantial decline in food stamp rolls ; the @entity212 has projected it could take 10 years			2
' we do not expect income inequality stabilizing or declining in the absence of real wage growth or a significant reduction in unemployment and underemployment problems , ' said @entity220 , an economist for the @entity221 at @entity222 who reviewed the @entity226 and @entity227 departments ' wage data			0
