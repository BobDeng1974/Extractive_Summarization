a @entity1 educated research scientist is so desperate to live the life of a wheelchair - bound person she is prepared to pay a doctor help her become disabled			1
since childhood , @entity6 has made several attempts at injuring herself so she can finally climb into her own wheelchair			1
in 2010 she even found a doctor overseas willing to help her become disabled by cutting her sciatic and femoral nerves , but she could not afford the £ 16,000 costs			1
she uses a wheelchair , even though her legs are fine , and has chosen to live as a disabled person , due to a rare condition ' i might never be able to afford it , but i know , truly and deeply , i wo n't regret it if i ever can , ' she said , referring to the doctor who might be able to help her become disabled			1
@entity6 , 58 , from @entity17 , @entity18 , suffers from a rare condition called @entity28 , or @entity28			1
sufferers do not accept one of their own limb or limbs and seek to amputate them or become paraplegic			0
able to stand : @entity6 , 58 , pictured out hiking in may this year in @entity17 , @entity18			1
she wears leg braces and uses a wheelchair , even though her legs are healthy some experts believe it is caused by a neurological fault , in which the brain 's mapping system can not see a certain body part			1
the @entity1 graduate believes both of her legs do not belong to her and dreams of being paralysed from the waist down			2
' something in my brain tells me my legs are not supposed to work , ' she said			2
' having any sensation in them just feels wrong			0
' for years she bandaged herself secretly , but now lives openly with her condition despite facing intolerance , insults , and sometimes online threats			0
@entity6 first realised she was different at the age of four , after visiting her @entity59 , who was using leg braces after a bike accident			1
' i wanted them too , ' she said			2
' i wondered why i was n't born needing them and felt something was wrong with me because i did n't have them			0
' at the age of nine , @entity6 even took action and pedalled her bike off a four - foot high acting stage on @entity71 , north @entity72 , landing on her neck			1
' i only wanted to stop my legs working but could have broken my neck or died , ' she added			1
from then on , @entity6 lived out her fantasy in secret , pretending to be disabled when alone , playing risky sports and climbing trees in the hope of hurting her legs			1
without her leg brace on in her bathroom in @entity17 , @entity84			2
her distorted body image causes her to sit in a wheelchair even though she can stand and ski now , as an adult , @entity6 enjoys the excitement of downhill skiing and the possibility she might fall and suffer serious leg fractures			1
' i ski extremely fast , and aim for the most dangerous runs , ' she said			0
@entity28 occurs when a person 's idea of how they should look does not match their actual physical form			2
the condition affects just a small percentage of the population			0
the sufferer wants to have an amputation			0
in most cases , the limb that the person would like removed is healthy			2
many psychologists and neurologists have tried to understand what the root cause of the condition is			0
the theory is that @entity28 occurs when the brain is not able to provide an accurate plan of the body			0
some experts believe the cause to be psychological			0
one theory is that a person with @entity28 may have seen an amputee at an earlier age and this image has replaced their own thoughts about what constitutes the ideal person			2
to become a better person they feel that a certain limb will have to be amputated			2
in severe cases , a person with @entity28 may harm the limb they wish to be removed or force doctors into removing it			2
others manage to cope with the illness by using canes and prosthetic attachments to help them feel complete			0
' doing any activity that brings a chance of me becoming paraplegic gives me a sense of relief from the anxiety caused by the @entity28			2
' my friends and family can get a little worried about me skiing , as they know i ski very aggressively and they know that in the back of my mind i actually want to get paralysed			2
' @entity6 had a real skiing accident seven years ago , which left her with a minor back injury and a reason to get leg braces			1
she researched the braces online and came across @entity28 for the first time			1
she discovered there were others like her			0
' it was a huge relief , ' she said			0
' i was n't a freak - there were hundreds of others like me			0
' she took part in a @entity28 research study with psychiatrist @entity164 , from @entity165 , who diagnosed her in @entity167 and recommending she use a wheelchair			1
at first , she used the chair in private , but eventually gained the courage to reveal her secret to friends and work colleagues			0
' the chair gives me psychological relief , instead of physical , ' she said			0
' i know it can be difficult for people without @entity28 to understand , but it 's what we feel			0
' in 2009 she was involved in a serious 75mph car crash and suffered pre-concussion amnesia and can not remember the 15 minutes before the impact			0
it was not a deliberate act , according to police reports , but she worries she might have subconsciously wanted it to happen			0
now , @entity6 spends most of her time in a wheelchair , but has to get out for various household tasks and walk down the steps to her car			1
with her doctor , dr @entity192			0
he is helping her with her condition @entity28 , or @entity28			0
@entity6 is a research scientist and graduate from @entity1 ' i ca n't afford to convert my home for disabled access so i just use the chair as much as i can , ' she said			1
she fantasises about having a car crash without hurting anyone else just so she can damage her own legs			0
' any time when i 'm driving i sort of conjure up accident scenarios in my mind where i will become paraplegic , ' she admitted			1
psychiatrist dr @entity192 , who treats @entity6 , said : ' the question i often ask is , is it better to have somebody pretending to use a wheelchair , or to commit suicide ? @entity6 pictured hiking with her friend @entity210 earlier this year in @entity17 , @entity18 , where she now lives			1
she is rarely seen out of her wheelchair @entity6 sitting with her friend @entity212 and her baby boy @entity214 ( pictured right ) back in may at her home in @entity17 , @entity18			1
friends and family worry about her as they know she wants to self harm @entity1 graduate @entity6 outside her workplace , the @entity221 , @entity84			1
she sometimes has to get out of her chair to walk up stairs or get into a car ' one possibility could be to do some sort of nerve blocking so that that limb could not actually be used for a period of time , to let the patient test the reality of being physically disabled temporarily			1
' it would give @entity28 sufferers a chance to change their minds if they wanted to			0
' @entity6 believes it is important to raise awareness about the condition and now writes for the @entity28 support group @entity28 .			2

@entity6 knew at 4 she was different and wanted to live as a disabled person
she wanted to wear leg braces like her aunt , hurt in an accident
aged 9 , she caused an accident to stop her own legs from working
now she enjoys the excitement of downhill skiing - because she might fall
she spends most of her time in a wheelchair , but is still able to stand up
a doctor is willing to help her become disabled , but it costs £ 16,000
psychiatrist : ' is it better pretending to use a wheelchair or commit suicide ? '
