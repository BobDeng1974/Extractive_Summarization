more than than eight million two - earner couples will be more than £ 1,330 better off on average next year as they gain a double benefit from the government 's flagship tax cuts			1
a @entity5 analysis seen by the @entity6 shows that 8.3 million families are winning twice from increases to the personal allowance for income tax , because both adults are in work			1
the amount of earnings on which no tax is paid will rise to £ 10,600 in april - the latest in a series of rises implemented by the coalition			1
people living in the @entity24 have done best , with those in the @entity37 next most likely to have benefited			0
ministers will hail the figures as evidence of the most fundamental change in the personal tax system for a generation - implemented despite the need for austerity measures			0
however , they risk fuelling a row over the government 's decision to target support at two - earner families			0
@entity51 @entity50 have complained of a growing discrepancy in the tax system between increasingly generous support for working couples with children and that for parents where a spouse stays at home to look after the children			0
on top of income tax breaks , the coalition has committed to introduce ‘ tax free childcare ’ for dual earner couples worth up to £ 2,000 a year per child			1
the chancellor is introducing a marriage tax allowance from next april designed to help one - earner couples , but it will be worth only around £ 200 a year			2
the married tax allowance will only apply to people paying the basic rate of tax , meaning that families with incomes above around £ 42,000 a year will not be helped			2
a total of 2.7million people will have been taken out of paying tax altogether when the personal allowance reaches £ 10,600 in april thousands of shop staff , care workers and nurses will be better off as a result of the personal allowance reaching £ 10,600 @entity85 has suggested that a majority conservative government would seek to go further , calling the tax break ‘ very much a first step ’			1
@entity89 and the @entity90 are committed to scrapping the marriage tax allowance , however			2
today 's analysis also shows that 5.6 families with children have benefited from the tax allowance change - with half of those securing a double advantage because they have two parents in work			1
dual income families would be better off by an average of £ 2,100 if the allowance was to rise to the target amount of £ 12,500 , the policy of both the conservatives and the @entity90			1
chief secretary to the treasury @entity105 said the ' @entity90 flagship policy ' had brought about the ' greatest revolution in the tax landscape for working people in living memory ' chief secretary to the treasury @entity105 said the ' @entity90 flagship policy ' had brought about the ' greatest revolution in the tax landscape for working people in living memory ' , ' many will remember that the @entity51 dismissed the policy during the leadership debates running up to the election in 2010 as unaffordable but @entity121 and i have fought tooth and nail to keep the successive rises in the personal allowance on the table at every @entity128 , ' the cabinet minister said			1
mr @entity105 's remarks are calculated to infuriate the @entity130 - who will today seek to put tax cuts at the heart of their campaign to stay in power			0
the coalition parties are engaged in a fierce battle to win credit from voters for the income tax breaks			2
' raising the personal allowance is an income tax cut for over 26 million working people worth £ 825 to typical basic rate taxpayers			1
and this new analysis reveals for the first time that dual earning households will be £ 1,330 better off on average , ' mr @entity105 added			0
' many will remember that the @entity51 dismissed the policy during the leadership debates running up to the election in 2010 as unaffordable			0
' but @entity121 and i have fought tooth and nail to keep the successive rises in the personal allowance on the table at every budget			0
' this analysis shows that our policy is benefitting working people and families the length and breadth of @entity167			2
recovering from the crash of the @entity89 years is a long process			0
there is a lot more to be done to fully repair the economy and to continue to get the financial pressure of families			0
' that ’s why we @entity90 are committed to raising the personal allowance still further , to £ 12,500 over the next @entity178			1
' that will deliver a further tax cut of £ 380 pounds to a typical basic rate tax payer and a further boost of £ 770 to dual income households			1
and this policy helps make our economy stronger and fairer in other ways too			0
it helps keep spending power in the economy and makes being in work pay			0
' deputy prime minister @entity121 said : ‘ these figures underline like never before the sheer scale of the tax cuts delivered by the @entity90 for working households across @entity167			0
many , including the prime minister , said it could not be done , but @entity105 and i have cut taxes for low and middle earners while pulling our country 's economy back from the brink where it was left by @entity89			0
and it 's not over yet			0
' the @entity90 may have cut people 's taxes by £ 825 but if we are in government again after 2015 , we will cut them by a further £ 380 by raising the point at which you start paying tax to £ 12,500			1
' the @entity5 figures show that 784,000 nurses and 821,000 working in school classrooms have gained the full benefit of the increase in the amount of tax - free income that can be earned			1
the largest number of families with children that will benefit from the personal allowance increase are from the @entity24 at 800,000 , followed by 700,000 from the @entity37			2

in total , 50 per cent of people on the minimum wage who had been previously paying income tax will be taken out of tax altogether by april .			2
