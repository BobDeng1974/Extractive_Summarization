@entity1 clubs looking for players at @entity3 and @entity4 this summer will find a team ’s worth			1
@entity7 want limited departures from the first team this summer because they ca n’t sign players until january but they also want to blood young players from their b - team out on loan at higher leagues because their second string is likely to be playing third division football			1
at @entity4 the need for a clear - out could make the exodus bigger than in most other seasons and boy wonder @entity21 will need a loan club			1
@entity23 look at 10 potential @entity25 exports			0
@entity21 ( right ) is expected to go out on loan from @entity4 to gain experience next season @entity29 he will probably stay for another year but there will be no shortage of suitors for the 27 - year - old if he does decide he ’s had enough			1
much may depend on the part he plays in the end of the season at the @entity39 as @entity41 's arrival has seen his opportunities restricted this year			2
@entity29 could be on his way out of @entity3 after falling down the pecking order since @entity41 's arrival if @entity4 step up their interest in @entity47 , it could mark the end of @entity50 's time at the club @entity50 @entity50 does n’t want to leave but if @entity4 sign @entity47 he may be more tempted			1
@entity53 have been interested in the past and @entity55 would suit the @entity57 international			0
@entity58 @entity58 played in midweek against @entity59 because @entity60 was suspended but there is little faith in his ability to be the @entity65 ’s long - term successor			2
@entity66 have looked at the defender before			0
not for nothing was he called up to the @entity57 squad aged 19			0
at the right club the 24 - year - old would thrive			0
@entity58 is not considered to be the long - term replacement for @entity60 at @entity3 @entity74 @entity74 remains one of the biggest mysteries of @entity4 ’s transfer policy in recent years			1
@entity78 requested the player in his second season at the club and he was brought in for £ 22million			0
he has played less than 40 percent of possible minutes and will be sold in the summer			0
inexplicably , he always looks a good player for @entity83 and his ability to play left back or left midfield is an added plus			0
@entity74 ( right ) has struggled to impress at @entity4 and could be offloaded in the summer @entity87 ( left ) could be loaned out next season with attacking opportunities limited at the @entity39 @entity90 another already called up by @entity57 because @entity92 did not want to lose him to @entity94			1
the 19 - year - old was brilliant for @entity3 earlier in the season , often starting ahead of @entity29 as everyone waited for @entity41 ’s return			1
he was impressive but now @entity3 are at full strength and he could be loaned out			2
@entity101 @entity101 , 25 , is beyond the point of being able to grow as a player with the occasional first team start			0
he is another in the same ‘ strange signing ’ bracket as @entity74			0
the midfielder cost £ 27million from @entity108 two years ago and has never looked good enough to play for @entity4			2
@entity66 have looked at him but @entity108 are keen to take him back			0
@entity101 has had his progress hindered by a lack of starting opportunities at @entity4 somewhere between the two he will find his level			1
@entity115 @entity115 can play anywhere across the front and looked like being the late entry in @entity92 ’s @entity57 squad last season until he tore his cruciate ligament			0
it ’s been a long way back and as ever at @entity4 holding down a first team place in the forward line is next to impossible			2
@entity115 will only be sent on loan to gain experience as @entity4 see him as a first team regular one day @entity115 ( left ) has endured a long recovery from injury after tearing his cruciate ligament last year @entity4 will only loan him , because they do see the 22 - year - old graduating to the first team one day			1
a season ’s experience in @entity135 would work wonders			0
@entity137 spurs were keen on 20 - year - old @entity139 when @entity140 was at the club			0
@entity3 believe he will be the long - term successor to @entity142			2
the problem for @entity139 is that @entity144 has years ahead of him			0
midfielder @entity139 ( left ) has been earmarked as @entity3 's next @entity142 a loan will be sought if @entity147 are relegated but @entity148 might also consider making @entity139 a first - team player next season			1
@entity151 are you still here ? the 28 - year - old @entity153 hardly played last season because of injury and this season has been no different thanks to a lack of form and many at @entity4 would say , application			1
@entity162 midfielder @entity151 ( left ) is expected to depart @entity4 after a minor role at the club this year @entity151 ( right ) pictured in action against @entity166 , the club that could be his next destination @entity166 are the favourites to sign him			2
@entity53 have looked before but huge wages are a major hurdle			0
@entity171 he has brought nothing but bad luck to @entity4 ’s b - team ‘ @entity176 ’ and it ’s no surprise team - mates would prefer he did n’t play , such is the team ’s improved form when he is off the pitch			1
the 16 - year - old @entity21 has struggled to fit in the @entity4 b - team and may depart on loan next season that ’s more a reflection of how he has n’t fitted in than any problems with his ability			1
the 16 - year - old prodigy will go out on loan next season but @entity135 suitors will find it tough to persuade @entity4 that the loan club should not be a @entity195 side .			1

@entity4 expected to have a summer clear - out when the season ends
@entity3 want to limit first - team departures *due* to their transfer *ban*
but the b - team face relegation and @entity3 want youngsters playing at a higher level
