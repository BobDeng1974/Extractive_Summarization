@entity1 's second @entity1 shoe collection is here - and @entity3 would be proud			1
the latest styles pay tribute to the actress 's friends , as well as her @entity9 home			1
one statement boot , the ' @entity11 ' , is named after @entity13 's legendary costume designer , @entity12 , while the ' @entity15 ' boot is named after her hair stylist @entity16			1
the line , available at @entity18 , runs the gamut from @entity21 classics ( which , incidentally , are making a comeback ) to rather more daring lace - up shoe - boots			1
all tied up : the latest @entity1 @entity1 shoe collection features the ' @entity25 ( $ 495 ) kick it : the @entity27 ( left ) is $ 495 while the @entity15 , named for hairstylist @entity16 ( right ) is $ 455 the ' @entity3 ' t - bar , which made so many headlines last time around , is back , as is the ' @entity30 ' - a sexy lace - up shoe - boot that exposes the foot at the front			1
there are bags too - the name of the ' @entity9 ' hobo speaks to aspiring @entity38 , while the ' @entity40 ' tote is a more contemporary style that could well be named after the upscale @entity43 enclave , @entity44 or the street and avenue of the same name			1
the price point remains high for a celebrity line - $ 220 to $ 695 - but then it was developed with the help of @entity52 ceo , @entity51			2
working it : @entity1 pictured today at a @entity18 event in @entity55 , @entity56 , wearing her new @entity27 design to great effect tribute : the ' @entity60 ( left ) is named after @entity13 's legendary costume designer , @entity12 and costs $ 695			1
the sexy ' @entity30 ' ( right ) makes a return in a new colorway ( $ 485 ) and it seems they are a good team			2
she told the @entity67 : ' it ’s unlike any other collaboration i ’ve ever been a part of			2
it ’s crazy , crazy simple in a way because we have lots and lots of ideas , our points of references are really similar			0
we did n’t realize but we have a short hand that ’s really fun			0
' we basically think about feelings and themes and from there we work			0
we get to a place where we have enough information to send to @entity86 in @entity87 , he makes our shoes for us , and then @entity86 gives us feedback			0
it ’s an amazing three - way conversation			0
then the samples come back and we tweak , tweak , tweak			0
we change the proportions , the elastic , we almost have a formula down now			0
' down to a t - bar : the much - loved ' @entity3 ' ( $ 355 , left ) and the ' @entity95 ' ( $ 375 , right ) step on it : the ' @entity97 ' ( left ) is a bold grosgrain pump ( $ 395 ) while the ' @entity100 ' brogue pump comes in a glossy silver ( $ 375 ) what a @entity3 on : the ' @entity9 ' hobo ( left , $ 375 ) and the ' @entity40 ' tote ( right , $ 495 )			0
