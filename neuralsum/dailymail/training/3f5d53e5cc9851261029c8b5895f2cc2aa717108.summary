the @entity0 on friday passed legislation giving the makers of the @entity4 pipeline the go - ahead to build the fourth and final section of the oil transportation system			1
the @entity0 has already sanctioned the construction of the @entity10 portion of the pipeline eight times but today it passed language identical to a bill under consideration in the @entity16 by a vote of 252 - 161			1
the @entity19 - controlled upper chamber has long declined to vote on the matter but had a change of heart on wednesday after sen. @entity23 of @entity24 begged her colleagues to immediately bring the legislation to the floor			1
@entity23 's @entity16 seat hangs in the balance after neither she nor her @entity31 opponent , congressman @entity30 , crossed a state - mandated threshold of 50 percent plus one in last week 's election			1
the three - term senator hopes to fend off @entity30 in an upcoming run - off election by pushing through approval of @entity4			1
the solid black and gray lines on the map shows already built portions of the @entity4			0
the red line represents the path of the proposed @entity10 portion that @entity43 is currently debating sen. @entity23 , chair of the @entity44 , left , is pictured here on wednesday at the @entity46 speaking to reporters with sen. @entity48 of @entity49			1
@entity23 is facing an uphill fight to hold her seat in a dec. 6 runoff against @entity31 congressman @entity30 , right			1
@entity30 is seen participating in a campaign rally on monday in a @entity56 bar in the above picture approval : sen. @entity23 of @entity24 is begging her @entity60 colleagues to approve the construction of @entity4 next tuesday in a bid to get reelected @entity30 and @entity23 will go head to head on dec. 6 as a result of @entity24 's jungle primary , which authorizes all candidates seeking office to appear on the ballot on @entity70			1
the top two vote - getters advance to a runoff if neither are able to reach a simple majority			0
@entity23 currently trails @entity30 by 16 points , according to internal polling taken by the @entity31 candidate that was shared with @entity78			1
passage of the pipeline may be her only shot of closing that gap			0
chair the @entity16 's @entity83 , @entity23 has made her seniority on the committee her main argument for reelection in her oil - rich state			1
however @entity30 got a bump of his own when incoming senate majority leader @entity90 publicly promised him a seat on the committee this week , assuming he wins next month 's election			2
as soon as lawmakers returned to the @entity46 for work this week @entity23 took to the @entity16 floor and called for a vote on @entity4 in an attempt to even the score			1
' we can have the @entity4 pipeline and answer the frustrations of the @entity107 people so they can ... say " oh my gosh the senators of @entity107 have ears , and they have brains , they have hearts and they heard what we said , " ' she argued			0
the @entity4 is an oil transportation system owned and operated by energy company @entity113			0
it stretches from @entity115 , @entity116 to southern @entity117 and @entity24 and would bring 700,000 barrels of oil daily from @entity116 to the @entity120 upon completion			0
the first three phases of the pipeline have already been built , while a fourth phase , the @entity10 portion , is still awaiting both government and court approval			0
the xl pipeline would replace the already constructed first phase and would run from @entity130 , @entity115 to @entity131 , @entity132			0
environmental groups strongly opposed the completion of the pipeline and have lobbied the @entity107 government to shoot down the proposal			0
in april the @entity139 administration announced that it was suspending its review of the pipeline until a court case in @entity132 challenging the xl route concluded			0
@entity145 officials , including the president , have repeatedly said in recent days that the administration 's position on the issue has not changed			0
after @entity23 rallied fellow senators on wednesday to bring @entity4 under formal consideration , @entity30 took to the @entity0 floor to ask the lower chamber to do the same			1
the legislation currently being debated was sponsored by @entity23 in her capacity as energy chief and was authored by sen. @entity157 of @entity158			2
it now awaits a vote in the @entity16 , scheduled for next tuesday , giving @entity23 a few more days to round up the 60 votes she needs to overcome a filibuster			1
every @entity31 in the @entity16 has committed to supporting the bill , giving her 45 yeas right off the bat			1
now she needs to convince just 14 of her @entity60 colleagues to vote her way , too			1
as of today , whip counts put her just one commitment shy of 60			0
if the @entity16 joins the @entity0 in approving the legislation , it will go directly to the president 's desk , per an agreement between @entity175 and @entity23			1
president @entity139 has not said whether he would veto it or not			2
if he did , it would take 67 votes in the @entity16 to bypass him - a number that @entity23 will not likely be able to match			2
notwithstanding a veto from @entity139 , @entity23 is convinced that authorization of @entity4 will be the miracle she needs to stay in @entity43			1
@entity30 has owned the issue as well in the final days of the campaign and tweeted this morning , ' not so fast , my friend : do n’t fall for ’s desperate “ @entity187			0
" ' the sponsor of the @entity0 version of the bill , @entity30 pointed out on thursday during debate on the @entity0 floor that its been more than six years since @entity113 first applied for permission to build the pipeline			2
' the bill considered today that i introduced is the language asked for by the @entity16			2
so we are going to make it as easy as possible for the @entity16 to finally get a bill to the president ’s desk that approves this long - overdue @entity4 , ' @entity30 said			1
' i encourage my colleagues to join me in approving the @entity4 pipeline to finally provide 40,000 promised jobs to the @entity107 people			2
' after the @entity0 vote @entity157 , a @entity31 , sent out a statement congratulating fellow @entity207 on passing his legislation in the @entity0 - making it clear just where his allegiances lie in the @entity16 race , even if @entity23 's name is on the @entity16 bill with him			1
@entity157 also stated that if the @entity16 was unable to reach 60 votes , he would reintroduce the bill next session after a handful of newly elected @entity31 lawmakers are seated			2
and if @entity139 vetoes the legislation , ' we are n't finished , ' @entity157 said on thursday			2
' we 'll pass it as either part of broader energy legislation or as an amendment to another must - pass bill			2
' @entity227 map : the @entity0 has already sanctioned the construction of the @entity10 portion of the pipeline eight times but today it passed language identical to a bill under consideration in the @entity16 by a vote of 252 - 161 president @entity139 would not say at a press conference last week if he would veto the construction of the @entity10 portion of the pipeline			1
@entity139 said he was waiting to make a decision until after @entity132 's @entity239 makes a ruling on the proposed path			0
' on @entity4 , there ’s an independent process			0
it ’s moving forward , and i ’m going to let that process play out , ' he said			0
' the process is moving forward , and i ’m just going to gather up the facts			0
' that court ruling is anticipated to come in the next few weeks			0
@entity139 told reporters covering his press conference in @entity252 on friday that his position on the issue remains the same			0
he did however push back on claims that @entity4 would be a ' massive jobs bill ' as proponents have claimed			2
furthermore , several senior level @entity145 officials have said on the record this week that the administration has a ' dim view ' of efforts in the legislative branch to force government approval of the pipeline , foreshadowing a possible veto from the president			1
@entity139 has only issued two presidential vetoes in his nearly six years as president , but with republicans controlling both chambers of @entity43 beginning in january , that number is expected to go up dramatically			0
house speaker @entity274 chided @entity139 on friday for his role in slowing down the @entity4 construction process			2
' thousands more @entity107 would be working today if president @entity139 had put their priorities ahead of his political interests and approved the @entity4 pipeline , ' @entity274 said in a statement after the @entity0 vote			1
' instead , he continues to block the project , and the new jobs , lower costs , and increased energy security it would provide , ' @entity274 continued			0
' the president does n’t have any more elections to win , and he has no other excuse for standing in the way			0
it ’s time he start listening to the vast majority of @entity107 who support @entity4			0
' a major environmental group , on the other hand , celebrated the prospect that the ' ill - considered legislation ' could earn ' a well - deserved presidential veto			0
' @entity300 , @entity116 project director at the @entity301 , said in a statement on friday afternoon that the ' @entity0 - passed bill is wrong for our country ' and would ' short - circuit the deliberative approval process that president @entity139 has said should run its due course			1
' ' it turns @entity43 into a permitting agency ; even worse , one waiving all environmental safeguards and legal challenges from the public , ' she claimed			0
' president @entity139 has ample reason to veto this measure , ' the statement went on to say , pointing out that the number of no votes in the @entity0 today show 's just how many legislators ' know the pipeline would be a disaster for our climate and a danger to the land and water that sustains countless @entity107			1

the @entity0 today passed a bill by a vote of 252 - 161 with identical language to legislation under consideration in the @entity16
sen. @entity23 of @entity24 is begging her @entity60 colleagues to approve construction of @entity4 next tuesday in a bid to get reelected
her @entity16 seat hangs in the balance after neither she nor her closest opponent met state *requirements* last week and will now face off dec. 6
@entity31 rep. @entity30 is polling 16 points above her and is expected to win
@entity139 has not said whether he will veto the @entity4 bill but the @entity145 has said they have a ' dim view ' of the *sudden* legislative push
