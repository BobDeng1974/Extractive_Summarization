she says she owes her life to her lucky black cat @entity19 who raises the alarm but @entity6 and her family are convinced her life has been saved several times by her black cat @entity19 , who recognises her attacks and nibbles the toes of her mother @entity28 , who jumps into action and calls 999			1

' if @entity6 has an attack , which can last up to 40 minutes , where she will be in such severe pain that she ca n’t speak or move , @entity19 will come into my bedroom and jump on me and bite my toes until i wake up			1
' @entity19 then stays with @entity6 until she finishes the attack or until the ambulance crew arrive			1
