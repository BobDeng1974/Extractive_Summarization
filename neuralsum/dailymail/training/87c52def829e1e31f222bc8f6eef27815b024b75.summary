not for @entity7 the everyday nappy bag from @entity15			0
for her first appearance en famille with baby @entity17 and 36 - year - old rapper boyfriend @entity19 , @entity7 toted a £ 20,000 @entity21 bag , stuffed full , no doubt , with @entity24 pacifiers , @entity26 baby bottles and cashmere babygros			1
