after a testing week in which his managerial methods were scrutinised and his @entity7 ‘ family ’ looked close to a break - up , this was a satisfying afternoon for @entity8			1
finding himself on the receiving end of a volley of abuse when @entity14 scored at @entity15 in midweek , the @entity9 was forced to admit that as ‘ father ’ to a squad of ’ 24 brothers ’ , he could n’t possibly keep everyone happy with enough game time			1
it led to rumours of a widening rift within the squad but , with @entity14 dropped and unity restored on the pitch at least , it was very much a happy home at @entity30 on saturday as woeful @entity31 were comfortably beaten			2
opener : @entity33 ( left ) scores the opener for @entity7 against @entity31 at @entity30 @entity7 : @entity35 ; @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 ; @entity39 ( @entity40 55 ) , @entity41 ( @entity42 82 ) , @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 ; @entity46 ( c ) , @entity33 ( @entity47 76 ) substitutes not used : @entity48 ( gk ) , @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 scorers : @entity33 20 , 67 ; @entity46 ( pen ) 58 ; @entity43 90 booked : @entity43 , @entity37 @entity31 : @entity54 ; @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 ( c ) , @entity58 ; @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 ( @entity63 76 ) ; @entity64 ( @entity65 62 ) , @entity66 ( @entity67 82 ) substitutes not used : @entity68 ( gk ) , @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 scorer : tamas own goal 32 booked : @entity60 , @entity59 sent off : @entity75 , @entity55 referee : @entity77 ( @entity78 ) attendance : 15,674 two wonderful goals from @entity33 , a free - kick from @entity43 and a @entity46 penalty after debutant @entity56 had been dismissed brought back the @entity83 ’ harmony and , as @entity31 hover above the @entity86 relegation places , turned up the pressure on @entity88			1
@entity7 ’s opener was a thing of beauty			2
from @entity43 ’s inswinging corner , @entity46 and @entity44 whisked the ball between statuesque @entity31 defenders to free @entity33			1
he saw his initial low shot blocked by @entity54 but the ball popped up obligingly for @entity9 - @entity97 to head home			0
but after such a moment of such quick minds and swift feet came a lapse in concentration and a clumsy boot that gifted @entity31 an equaliser			0
@entity107 found space to cross low from the right and , though the ball was heading for nobody in particular , it was diverted beyond @entity35 by @entity36 ’s outstretched leg			2
it was pretty much all @entity31 created			0
@entity107 was lively , as was @entity62 , but debutant striker @entity114 , signed from @entity117 outfit @entity115 in the week , struggled to keep pace			0
performance : @entity33 ( right ) scored twice and won a penalty which @entity46 converted the other new boy @entity56 , the centre - back known as ‘ @entity123 ’ by fans at his previous club @entity125 , was n’t exactly heroic when he allowed @entity38 a free header from @entity41 ’s corner			1
luckily for @entity31 , he put it over the bar			2
but that was just the beginning of @entity56 ’s problems			0
shortly before the hour , @entity33 burst into the @entity31 box and the @entity9 hacked him down			1
referee @entity77 had little choice but to show a red card			0
@entity46 had impressed most for @entity7			1
his vivid orange boots acted as a beacon for pretty much every attack			0
always willing , always running , he was adept at holding the ball up and sparking his team into life			0
he proved reliable at penalty taking too , sending the ball straight down the middle to restore @entity7 ’s lead			2
from then on , it was one - way traffic and the livewire @entity33 , collecting the ball on the left - hand side of the box , skipped past challenge after challenge before seeing his shot trickle in off the inside of the post for his third of the season			1
surely it could n't get any worse for @entity31 ? it certainly did			0
@entity43 fired home a lovely free - kick in injury time , before @entity55 saw red for a senseless head - butt on @entity165			1
it ’s not too late to play @entity167 … there ’s £ 1,000 to be won every week by the highest scoring manager			0

@entity51 started on bench after suffering dead leg against @entity15
@entity33 opens the scoring for @entity7

@entity46 scores the *subsequent* penalty
