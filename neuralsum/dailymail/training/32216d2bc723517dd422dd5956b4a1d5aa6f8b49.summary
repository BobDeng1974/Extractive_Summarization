a @entity1 bid to make it illegal to cut aid spending from present levels was a step closer last night – despite noisy opposition from some @entity8 mps			1
the @entity9 approved legislation to enshrine in law the principle that spending on international aid must never fall below 0.7 per cent of national income			1
the controversial bill to gold plate @entity19 ’s annual £ 11.5billion aid budget now goes to the @entity20 and could become law within months			1
pictured , @entity19 soldiers checking aid packages bound for @entity29 this year one @entity8 mp spoke for 75 minutes in an attempt to stop the private members ’ bill being passed , but in the end a promised rebellion of conservative backbenchers never took place			1
just five voted against the legislation			0
the bill was proposed by @entity40 , the former @entity41 , and was supported by the front benches of all three main parties			2
@entity19 has already reached the @entity45 ’s 0.7 per cent target , and @entity8 ministers have said there was no need to enshrine it in law because the target has already been met			1
but , during yesterday ’s debate , @entity8 backbencher @entity51 said the law would mean that people would not give to charity – as they would see it as the government ’s job			1
he said : ‘ this country and the people of this country have a long and proud history of giving generously to charity and long may that continue			2
‘ but there is a danger , is there not , that some , not all , but some might think that by enshrining the 0.7 per cent figure in statute that the government is doing their job for them			2
‘ i 'd like to see people feel that it is their responsibility , as well as a matter of charity and an act of charity , to give to international aid charities			1
’ a series of votes were won during report stage by majorities of more than 140 as just a handful of @entity7 dug in and attempted to frustrate the @entity88 's progress			0
but following a closure motion to halt the final debate , third reading on the @entity1 mp 's @entity88 was agreed by 146 to five , majority 141			0
the @entity88 will now be sent to the @entity20 for further scrutiny			0
if it is amended and returned to @entity7 , there are five more days before the election to agree a finalised @entity88			0
if peers make no changes and pass the @entity88 , it will become law			2
the @entity88 legislates to make the aim of spending 0.7 per cent of national income on overseas development a legal requirement			2
speaking during the third reading debate , international development minister @entity105 reiterated the government 's support for the @entity88 and said it was a ‘ timely @entity88 in the face of an enormous humanitarian crisis across the world ’			0
prime minister @entity113 backed the bill , but did not take part in today 's @entity9 vote shadow international development secretary @entity117 said @entity19 's international development spending was not only ‘ morally right ’ , but in @entity19 's national interest			1
she added : ‘ few votes in this place can with certainty be said to save millions of lives			0
’ introducing the debate , mr @entity40 said : ‘ by enshrining this commitment in law , the parties represented in this chamber honour the election commitments of 2010 , the @entity45 honours the @entity125			2
‘ but perhaps more importantly than either of those , we give predictability to our aid expenditure , critically for our partners and the recipients of the assistance			2
‘ we show leadership internationally which can be used to press other rich countries to join us , the first @entity142 country to reach the @entity144 target and we move the debate on to focus on how we allocate our overseas development aid , not how much we spend on it			1
’ @entity148 , the mp for @entity149 , said : ' overseas aid is the taking of money from poor people in rich countries and giving it to rich people in poor countries ' the @entity88 was bitterly opposed by a handful of mps on the @entity8 backbench , producing a stubborn minority of between four and six votes on a series of divisions during the day			1
mr @entity51 , mp for @entity164 , began proceedings with a report stage speech that ran to almost an hour , arguing there was no reason for international development to be uniquely protected			0
@entity149 mp @entity148 spoke for 75 minutes and said : ‘ for lots of people around the country , they feel that overseas aid is the taking of money from poor people in rich countries and giving it to rich people in poor countries			1
‘ what they see is millions of pounds siphoned off by dictators around the world for a new fleet of @entity183 or whatever it may be and think the government may as well include a @entity183 catalogue with the aid they are giving to some of these countries			1
‘ my concern about overseas aid spending ... is that first of all it does n't actually work			0
we have been pouring billions and billions of pounds into countries in @entity196 which are no further on than when we started pouring billions and billions of pounds into them			0
’ conservative commitment to the legislation – promised in the party 's 2010 manifesto and included in the coalition agreement – has been undermined by foreign secretary @entity203 who described it as a ‘ bizarre idea ’			0
with experts warning that the government 's latest economic blueprint will mean spending cuts in the @entity19 ‘ on a colossal scale ’ , @entity113 is under mounting pressure from many @entity8 activists , as well as @entity213 , to remove the ring fence protecting aid from cuts			1
dissent over the scale of spending will be further inflamed by the need for the government to find more money than expected to meet the target because of a recent recalculation of gdp that pushed the @entity19 's national wealth higher			2
@entity227 said the prime minister supports the @entity40 bill , but was not intending to take part in the @entity9 vote			1
‘ he will be in his constituency , ’ said a @entity233 spokeswoman			0
‘ it is usual practice for the prime minister to spend fridays in his constituency			0
‘ he thinks this is an important commitment , it is right that we help the poorest people in the world and it is right that we stick by the promises made to them to do it			0
‘ he believes that there should be support for the @entity88 and he is confident that it will probably go ahead			0

backbench bid to enshrine in law target to spend 0.7 *%* of gdp on aid
law passes in the @entity9 despite noisy opposition from @entity8 mps
critics say ' poor people in rich countries ' are *footing* the bill for others
