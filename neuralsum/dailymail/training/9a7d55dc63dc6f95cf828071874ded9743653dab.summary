by @entity0 published : 05:39 est , 25 april 2013 updated : 06:51 est , 25 april 2013 the @entity1 has come under fire after it emerged that @entity3 is paying skilled singers just £ 55 per day to perform			1
members of a cathedral choir due to be featured on the iconic programme have hit out at the ' insulting ' fee being paid for their services			1
they claim the corporation has previously agreed to pay £ 214 for a day 's singing - more than four times the payment currently being offered			1
three episodes of @entity3 will be filmed next month at @entity13 in @entity14 , featuring the 900 - year - old church 's highly respected professional choir			1
outcry : singers at @entity13 , pictured , say they are being underpaid for appearing on @entity3 but its singers have complained that the £ 110 they will receive for taking part in the two - day filming session is not enough , and have called for the production company which makes the programme to increase the fee			1
the daily rate of £ 55 translates into an annual salary of just £ 14,300 , well below the national average wage of £ 26,500			0
' the fee offered to members of the choir for singing in these programmes is £ 110 - considerably less than the rate agreed between the @entity1 and my union equity , ' said chorister @entity36			1
' it seems to me there is an attempt to deprive choir members of the fees they are entitled to			2
' fellow choir member @entity43 , who has been singing for 17 years , said : ' the @entity45 agreement with @entity34 says choir members should be paid £ 214 for a daily session of up to five hours			1
' but the recording is taking place over two days so people should be paid two daily fees			0
' i think it 's pretty insulting to expect members of the choir to sing for less money than they are entitled to			2
i ca n't imagine them expecting the choir of @entity57 in @entity58 to perform cut - price			0
' iconic : songs of praise is filmed at a number of notable churches and cathedrals across the @entity64 ; a previous edition of the programme is pictured here the @entity14 episodes of @entity3 is being produced by @entity70 television production @entity68 , and will be screened on @entity1			2

its lay members receive a monthly salary from the diocese in return for performing at six services a week			0
the dean of the cathedral has insisted that despite singers ' protests it would be ' an honour ' to host @entity3 , and argued that participants should not seek to profit from the recording			0
' it is a privilege for @entity13 as it allows us to share our worship with millions of viewers across the @entity64 and beyond , ' @entity89 said			0
' it 's a low - budget programme and we are not taking part in order to profit financially			0
' at present , the form of the programme and the musical items are still being considered and no final decision has been taken about which musicians will be taking part			0
' a @entity1 spokesman said : ' the independent production company which is producing this recording for @entity3 are still in discussion with the @entity13 about the choir 's involvement and the fees involved that will be in line with agreed industry rates			1
