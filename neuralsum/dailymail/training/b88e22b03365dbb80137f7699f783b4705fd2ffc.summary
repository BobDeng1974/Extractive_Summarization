the @entity1 's decision to stay elsewhere on her @entity3 estate to let tourists wander her castle home has paid off			1
visitor numbers have increased five per cent this summer - edging past 70,000 , the best for five years and nearly a record for the royal retreat			1
some 40 per cent of the tourists came from overseas , underlining the foreign attraction of the @entity12			0
good move : the decision by the @entity1 , pictured with prince @entity15 , to let tourists wander @entity3 has paid off tourist boom : @entity3 has seen visitors reach a five - year high because of a timetable clash this year , the @entity20 was in @entity22 earlier than usual for the @entity23 , meaning tourists were still wandering around her summer residence before it closed at the end of july			1
so , following her visit to the @entity29 , the @entity1 moved into the seven - bedroom @entity30 on the 50,000 acre estate instead , which is about a mile away from the castle			1
the arrangements were made so the estate could stay open to the public for its normal seasonal period of april to july			2
the 88 - year - old monarch 's move to @entity39 was prompted by the growing need to maximise tourist revenue to make the estate pay for itself			2
running costs : the increase in visitor numbers to @entity3 means half the £ 3m costs will be met it costs around £ 3m - a - year to run @entity3 - which is owned privately by the @entity1 - and tourist revenue meets about half the bills			1
but her decision to let the castle remain open as normal has helped ring the cash tils louder at @entity3			1
adults pay £ 11 - and children £ 5 - to visit part of the castle and its grounds			1
@entity58 , the estate 's visitor enterprise manager , said it had been ' a very good year '			2
' we are about five per cent up on last year and we are very pleased , ' he said			0
' they are the best figures for five years and a near record			2
' we had a good number of overseas visitors too			0
about 40 per cent of our visitors come from abroad - with @entity68 the biggest market			0
as well as numbers being up , so was the visitor spend too			1
' the @entity1 's decision to stay at @entity73 means that the estate has been able to generate as full a revenue as possible from tourism at the close of its season			0
the success has also helped the it freeze next year 's admission prices			0
@entity82 has been well - used by the @entity83 in the past			1
prince @entity85 stayed there with @entity87 after their 1981 wedding , as did prince @entity90 and @entity91 after their marriage			0
visitor numbers have increased five per cent this summer - edging past 70,000 , the best for five years the estate has also tried to maximise income from activities such as running holidays , cottage rentals , fishing , wildlife safari trips , weddings and corporate hospitality events			1
@entity3 's golf club , used by the @entity83 , was hired out for 11 corporate days - bagging more than £ 25,000 for the @entity20 - with even clubhouse barbecues arranged for sunny days			1
@entity3 was beloved by @entity108 and @entity109 and has remained a favourite with the @entity1 and her family			1
the castle is located on a working estate which aims to protect the environment while contributing to the local economy			0
earlier this year @entity116 heard that the @entity1 was to be down to her last £ 1million and her palaces are ' crumbling '			0
the @entity118 criticised the household for failing to make more savings and also said it should be making more money			0
@entity3 is privately owned by the @entity1 and who meets its costs personally			1
@entity3 was beloved by @entity108 and @entity109 and has remained a favourite with the @entity1 meanwhile @entity126 is to come more than two months early at the @entity1 's @entity22 retreat this week			2
@entity3 has decided to hold its @entity126 sale on tuesday - because an historic @entity129 that is near it will be closed for several months over the winter to allow work to strengthen and improve it			1
the @entity133 , close to the @entity1 's home , will close on wednesday ( october 8 ) and is scheduled to reopen at the start of february 2015			0
the £ 450,000 work is essential to its long term future			0
designed by @entity138 , @entity133 was constructed in 1857 for @entity109			0
it is a category - a listed heritage structure which carries the @entity140 over the @entity141 near to @entity3			1
but the current bridge decking has been subject to the elements for 35 years			0
the bridge will also be repainted to protect it			0
the next available vehicular crossing over the @entity147 is at @entity148 , meaning a total diversion of around 14 miles for those living on and around the @entity3			2
so @entity3 has decided to hold its annual festive sale on tuesday ( october 7 ) , the day before the bridge closes			2
@entity154 will be open between 3pm until 7pm .			0

visitor numbers to @entity3 have edged past 70,000
@entity158 , which brings in half £ 3m running costs - is best for five years
