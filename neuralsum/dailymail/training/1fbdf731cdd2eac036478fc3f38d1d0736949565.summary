@entity0 might have achieved the impossible			1
he might have delivered the landslide of goals it needed to fill a void in goal difference as deep as the @entity6 and thereby send the @entity7 plunging from that famous precipice of theirs			1
if half the great man ’s thunderous shots and leaping headers had crossed the line then @entity10 would have done so too			1
inexplicably , it was not to be			2
at the very least the supreme footballer of the year should have gone out of @entity17 2014 — and perhaps departed the @entity18 forever — with a hat - trick			2
sure shot : @entity10 's @entity0 scores the second goal against @entity22 no reason to celebrate : @entity0 walks back after scoring the winner net result : the view behid the goal as @entity0 scores the second goal against @entity22 @entity10 ( 4 - 3 - 3 ) : @entity30 7 , @entity31 6 , @entity32 6.5 , @entity33 5.5 , @entity34 5.5 , @entity35 6.5 , @entity36 6 , @entity37 6 , @entity38 6 , @entity39 7 , @entity0 9.5 coach : @entity41 6.6 goals : @entity44 og , @entity0 80			1
@entity22 ( 4 - 2 - 2 - 2 ) : @entity45 6.5 , @entity46 6.5 , @entity47 5 , @entity48 6 , @entity49 6 , @entity50 6 , @entity51 6 , @entity52 7 , a @entity53 6 , @entity54 7 , @entity55 7.5 booked : @entity46 , @entity54 , @entity53			1
att : 67,540 coach : @entity58 5 referee : @entity60 ( @entity61 ) 6 yet the fates decreed he should be given only one goal			2
it was a trifle in return for the command performance he gave			0
it was the winner , against a @entity22 team which cast out its own demons to put on a thrilling show of their own			1
but it was not the miracle this genius of a ball conjurer deserved			0
run after run and shot after shot ended in seemingly impossible frustration			0
when one last brilliant , surging effort was somehow denied he just sat there , at first beating his fists on the turf in despair , then gazing around him disbelief			0
if it is some small consolation , @entity0 will be forever remembered for what he almost achieved on this sunlit afternoon , not for his failure to match @entity90 and now @entity91 in @entity18 goalscoring			1
that @entity0 , 29 , could play with such desire despite carrying into this match his belief that @entity10 were not good enough to challenge for the game ’s greatest prize is all the more remarkable			1
kudos , also , to @entity22			2
they came into this match out of meltdown in their dressing room and made a splendid fight of it			0
it all came to a thrilling climax but there had been as much or more turmoil going on before it started			0
tumble : @entity0 goes down under the challenge of @entity22 defender @entity47 @entity0 packing in readiness for going home as soon as the game was over			1
@entity22 beating him to it by sending two of their players packing before the kick - off			1
the @entity119 flying in three million bucks in readies to stop the rest of their team packing up before they even found out they had not scraped through to the last 16			0
never mind that both @entity10 and @entity22 still had a chance of making it to the knockout phase at kick - off			1
an outside chance , maybe , but surely one still worth fighting for no matter what was going on over in @entity130			0
at least @entity131 thought so			0
the @entity133 midfielder was so upset with the way things were going that he physically assaulted a @entity137 executive committee man during a team meeting			0
@entity142 , once of @entity139 and @entity140 and now with @entity141 , did not go quite that far but he did make his feelings known as to why @entity22 were bottom of this group with a ‘ vulgar verbal assault ’ on manager @entity58			2
the pair were put on the first plane out of here			0
but do n’t feel sorry for those two			0
save your pity for the tens of thousands of @entity22 fans who had travelled in the hope of seeing @entity119 ’s day at the @entity18 finally arrive			2
in control : @entity0 holds off @entity55 ( left ) and @entity50 of @entity22 @entity0 , for his part , had written off @entity10 ’s prospects , admitting : ‘ we were never going to win the @entity18 with a team as average as this			1
’ how close he came to proving himself wrong			0
@entity0 came close to opening the scoring in the fifth minute when no one else in this skyscraper stadium sensed a whiff of a chance			1
from way out on the right he floated a cross beyond and behind @entity167 , who could only turn and watch the ball rebound from his crossbar			0
six minutes later @entity22 ’s goalkeeper dived to his left to turn aside a trademark @entity0 free - kick			1
seven minutes after that the new @entity174 rose for a powerful header which @entity167 palmed away			0
so it was to go on … and on			0
down and out : @entity10 captain @entity0 @entity22 , with their nation ’s pride to save , were having their moments , too			1
by a poignant irony , a @entity137 defender scored for @entity10 the goal for which , after half an hour , @entity0 was still urgently striving			1
@entity34 crossed on the run from the left and @entity47 ’s panicky swing contrived to provide a finishing touch of which @entity0 would have been proud			1
the ball looped upwards off his knee at an implausible angle to ricochet gently into the net off both bar and post			0
on the stroke of half - time we were almost bore witness to history			2
the same @entity137 defender took a similar wild swing , only this time the ball sheered just over the bar			0
maybe it would be safer to leave this @entity47 in @entity206			2
no sooner had @entity207 put @entity208 ahead in @entity130 than the glimmer of hope that @entity10 might overturn the @entity7 ’s goal difference advantage evaporated with a @entity22 equaliser			1
clinical : @entity22 's @entity55 , left , scores the equaliser against @entity10 clinical : @entity22 's @entity55 , left , scores the equaliser against @entity10 @entity55 rose to meet @entity49 ’s cross with an unstoppable header			1
now it was @entity22 who had closed within striking distance of the @entity7			2
their athletic pace kept carrying them deep into the @entity225 penalty area but the finishing touch eluded them			0
that dream finally died at the feet of @entity0 — who else ? after slamming his shot low into the corner from @entity167 ’s weak palming down of the ball , @entity0 spurned celebration			2
he just turned away , knowing that his race was run			0
support : @entity10 's defender @entity32 helps up @entity0			1

@entity0 scored in 80th minute but @entity10 miss out on goal difference
@entity241 secured second place despite losing 1 - 0 to @entity208
@entity47 scored an own goal before @entity55 equalised for @entity22
