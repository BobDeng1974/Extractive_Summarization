by @entity1 reporter published : 11:03 est , 25 january 2013 updated : 13:32 est , 25 january 2013 floppy feline : four month old rescue kitten @entity3 was born with bones missing from his two front legs the pictures of @entity3 the kitten crawling around on his elbows tugged at the heart - strings of cat - lovers across the globe			1
the four - month - old cat rescue cat was born with a rare condition which meant he had no bones in his front legs			1
but @entity3 is now expected to be walking around on his front paws in a couple of months after a total of £ 3,500 was donated to fund a operation to fix the birth defect			1
the money has flooded in during the past few days to a @entity25 webpage , called ' @entity26 ' , set up by staff at @entity28			0
@entity3 , who has a rare condition called radial agenesis , was spotted when his owner put him up for sale on the online advertising site @entity34			1
an x-ray revealed that @entity3 ’s ulna and radius bones , which connect the upper half of his front legs to his paws , were missing			1
the kitten is currently being looked after by his ‘ foster carer ’ @entity43 , 50 , who said : ‘ he ’s a lovely little thing			2
‘ because @entity3 was born that way he does n’t know there ’s anything wrong with him so he runs around on his elbows and happily plays with my other cat and dog			1
‘ he ’s ok at the moment but if he does n’t get the operation he ’ll start to damage his spine when he gets bigger			0
’ a well - wisher acquired @entity3 from @entity34 in november and handed him in at a @entity28 branch in @entity65			1
cruel : the kitten , which suffers with radial agenesis , had been listed for sale on the advertising website @entity34 by its cruel former owner operation : @entity3 is missing the bones that connect the upper half of the front legs to the paws , but is due to have metal pins fitted as a replacement thanks to animal charity @entity28 @entity79 - fect future : the rescue kitten with ' foster owner ' @entity43 , who says she has never seen a cat with a condition like @entity3 's ' lovely little thing ' : @entity3 is being looked after by @entity43 , who has been fostering cats for 25 years workers , who thought he had simply been born with dislocated legs , took him to a vet , where the x-ray revealed he had radial agenesis , which occurs when an animal ’s leg bones fail to develop			1
the condition can be corrected by implanting metal pins between the paw and upper bone , but an operation can be carried out only on cats over six months old to give the existing bones time to harden and take the weight of the pins			0
@entity103 , co-ordinator of @entity28 ’s @entity65 branch , said : ‘ a friend of the branch spotted him on @entity34			2
it said in the advert he had two broken legs but when she got there he had no bones at all			0
she felt sorry for him and took him home but it became clear he needed a lot of treatment and that ’s when we got involved			0
rare condition : only four cats have been born with radial agenesis in @entity119 in the past 30 years ‘ once @entity3 has had the operation , his future looks very bright			2
’ a spokesman for @entity34 , which lets sellers post adverts for free , said : ‘ we have a very strict policy regarding the sale of sick or injured animals on the website			2
‘ we apologise that someone was able to post an advert for @entity3 despite him having medical problems and we will do our best to make sure similar incidents do not occur in the future			2
’ radial agenesis ( also known as squitten ) is known as the ' twisty ' mutation in cats			0
it causes the two long bones in the lower foreleg to be unusually short			0
in severe cases , the bone is almost absent and the paw appears to be attached to the elbow			0
the condition became well known when an individual in @entity150 , @entity148 deliberately bred several cats with this affliction and dubbed them ' twisty cats ' cats with the condition often sit on their rump with their forelegs unable to touch the floor ; this gives them a resemblance to a squirrel or kangaroo			0

@entity3 the kitten captured the heart of cat - lovers after pictured crawling on his elbows
the four - month - old was rescued after it was spotted listed for sale on the @entity34 website by its cruel owner
@entity3 is now due to have operation to *straighten* his two front legs
