on monday night many observers in the @entity1 reported seeing an odd halo of light around the moon			1
the remarkable phenomenon was captured in stunning images , showing the moon surrounded by a bright ring of light			1
the spectacle is caused by ice crystals in the atmosphere , specifically when thin cirrus or cirrostratus clouds are present at an altitude of about 20,000 feet ( 6,100 metres )			1
pictured is the moon halo over the , @entity18			0
the moon halo is formed by a high - altitude ice crystal cloud that gathers around the moon during cold weather these clouds can contain millions of hexagonal ice crystals , and as light from the moon - which is just reflected sunlight - passes through the atmosphere , it refracts in a particular way within the crystals			1
specifically , the light refracts at angles no smaller than 22 ° - sometimes leading the phenomenon to be called a 22 ° halo - which results in a ring around 44 times larger than the moon itself			1
different colours of light are bent at different angles , resulting in the inner edge of the halo being slightly red , and the outer edge having a slightly bluer tint			2
here the moon halo is spotted over @entity47			0
the bright ' star ' to the left of the moon in the image is @entity52 , which is making its closest approach to @entity54 until 2019 at the moment the light refracts at angles no smaller than 22 ° in the ice crystals ( illustrated ) - sometimes leading the phenomenon to be called a 22 ° halo - which results in a ring around 44 times larger than the moon itself this photo , taken in @entity65 , shows the large halo ; its radius is roughly the size of an outstretched hand at arms length some people online took to @entity72 to express their amazement at seeing the moon ring the phenomenon occurs when the sky is full of thin cirrus or cirrostratus clouds , seen as a thin wisp on the left in an image taken by @entity82 , 41 at his home in @entity84 in @entity85			1
different colours of light are bent at different amounts , so the inner edge of the halo is slightly red , and the outer edge is slightly more blue , seen on the right above @entity93 's lighthouse , @entity18 the effect was visible to observers across the @entity1 including the @entity18 and in @entity96 the reason that it forms as a ring is because of the angle of refraction			1
the only light that reaches your location is that which is located at the right distance away from the moon to form a ring			2
here , a vapour trail from a plane is seen cutting through the halo above @entity96 the effect is not exclusive to the moon , however			0
it can also occur around the sun , for the same reasons described above			0
on some occasions the halos are accompanied by sundogs - bright spots either side of the moon or sun as the crystals sink through the air , causing the light to be vertically aligned			1
‘ ice halos are atmospheric phenomena that can occur around the sun or the moon , when tiny crystals of ice in the atmosphere refract and reflect light , creating a halo around the solar or lunar source , ’ @entity126 , editor for @entity127 , told @entity128			1
‘ visually , they can range from the one we could see [ on monday ] night in parts of the @entity1 , which was a cool and slightly creepy perfect circle around the moon , to a bright and ethereal display featuring multiple arcs and ' sundogs ' ( also known as parhelia ) , which appear as bright spots at the corners of the halo when the sun is near the horizon			1
’ ‘ even the more ordinary halos are fairly uncommon in the @entity1 but in particularly bright and bitter conditions , such as in the @entity156 , absolutely spectacular ice halo displays can appear			2
’ other users on @entity72 were not so lucky , with some bemoaning the cloudy conditions that made the effect not visible ice halos were once said to be a sign that a storm was approaching , as cirrus or cirrostratus clouds often come before a large storm front			1
however , the clouds can also occur without a large storm approaching , so their use as an accurate weather prediction tool is not entirely accurate			2
the images also show the gas giant planet @entity52 near the moon			2
the planet is due to make its closest approach to @entity54 until 2019 this friday 6 february , so it is particularly bright and visible in the night sky at the moment			0
known as opposition , the event will see @entity52 come within 404 million miles ( 650 million kilometers ) of @entity54			0
shown are sundogs apppearing either side of the sun in @entity183 , @entity184 the sight of three suns in the sky is enough to make most of us rub our eyes in disbelief , but centuries ago , the strange sight was seen as a bad omen			0
the unusual spectacle is called a parhelion or a sundog			0
it is the result of a natural phenomenon in which sunlight passes though snow crystals in a particular way when they are suspended in the air			2
sundogs are created when sunlight is refracted by large , hexagonal ice crystals , such as those in snowflakes			1
they typically appear as two coloured patches of light either side of the sun and though rare , can in theory be seen anywhere in the world in any season			0
they are created by the refraction of light passing through flat , hexagonal ice crystals in high , cold clouds			1
the crystals act like prisms so that as light passes through them , it is bent by exactly 22 degrees before reaching viewers ' eyes to make the illusion			2
if the crystals are more randomly located in clouds , a complete ring around the sun is visible , called a halo			0
but if the crystals sink through the air , they become arranged in vertical lines , so that the sunlight is refracted horizontally , to make sundogs , as seen in these images			0
if the phenomenon is seen as the sun is rising , the sundogs gradually move further away from the sun , but always stay at the same elevation , so the three ' orbs ' appear to be the same distance from the horizon			0
they are reddest in colour when they are near to the sun and fade to yellow , orange and then blue as they move away			0
the colours of sundogs merge into a white halo in some instances .			0

observers around the @entity1 *snapped* images of a ' moon ring ' monday night
the amazing phenomenon occurs when light from the moon reflects off ice crystals in the atmosphere
the light refracts at 22 ° in the ice , so the eye only sees the ring of light around the moon - and not elsewhere
different colours also refract differently - so the inside of the ring appears red , and the outside is blue
the phenomenon is often said to warn of an approaching storm front - although that 's not entirely true
