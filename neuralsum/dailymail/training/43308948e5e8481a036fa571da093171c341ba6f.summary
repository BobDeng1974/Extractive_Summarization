five copper coins found in northern @entity1 could rewrite the country 's history			1
the coins are thought to date back as early as the 900s and are believed to have originated in @entity6			1
written history of @entity1 only dates back to 1606 , when @entity9 explorers landed in the region , and researchers from @entity12 want to find out how the thousand - year - old copper coins ended up on the other side of the @entity15 six centuries earlier			1
copper coins , thought to have originated in @entity6 and dating back as early as the 900s , were discovered on the @entity18 off the north coast of @entity1 in 1944			1
researchers from @entity12 now want to find out how the coins got to @entity1 and their findings could suggest the country was found six centuries before @entity25 explorer @entity23 arrived in 1770 @entity26 @entity1 are thought to have first arrived on the @entity1 mainland by boat from the @entity29 between 40,000 and 60,000 years ago			1
however , the first known landing in @entity1 by @entity31 was by @entity9 navigator @entity32 in 1606			0
other @entity9 navigators explored the western and southern coasts in the 17th century , and dubbed the continent ' @entity35			0
' in 1770 , @entity25 explorer captain @entity23 explored the east coast of @entity1			1
the @entity25 penal colony was then first established at @entity39 in january 1788			2
during the following century , the @entity25 established other colonies on the continent			2
this reduced the number of indigenous @entity1 because of conflict with the colonists and new diseases bought over from @entity31			0
@entity1 fought with the @entity25 during both world wars			2
lead researcher , @entity1 scientist @entity48 said the coins were first discovered by soldier @entity51 in 1944			0
@entity51 was stationed on the @entity18 - an uninhabited group of islands of the north coast of @entity1 - during @entity55 and he found the coins buried beneath the sand			1
in 1979 , @entity51 sent the coins to an @entity1 museum and now @entity48 wants to investigate how they arrived on the island			2
@entity51 also marked the location the coins were found on a map using an ' x '			2
at the same time , @entity51 found four coins that came from the @entity67 , dating back to 1690			1
this discovery supports claims that @entity9 explorers discovered the island before captain @entity23 in 1770			1
@entity1 scientist and professor at @entity12 , @entity48 , points to the location where the copper coins were found @entity48 and his team are arranging an expedition to the region in july			2
the coins are thought to be of @entity81 descent and originated from the former @entity83 sultanate			1
@entity83 used to a trade port and had links to @entity86 in the 13th to 16th century			2
the region is now a @entity89 ruin on an island off @entity91			1
the copper coins were the first coins to ever be produced in @entity6 and they have only been found outside of @entity6 twice			0
once in @entity94 at the start of the century , and again by @entity51 in 1944			0
the coins were found on a beach on the @entity18			0
the islands , pictured here at marker a , are off the coast of the @entity101 of @entity1			0
they were a key strategic position during the @entity55 the copper coins found off the north coast of @entity1 are said to have originated from @entity83 , a former sultanate island near modern - day @entity91 in @entity6 it was originally thought that @entity9 explorers first ' discovered ' @entity1 in the 1600s			1
in 1770 , @entity25 explorer , captain @entity23 was the first @entity31 to explore the eastern coast of @entity1 and claimed the country for the @entity25 throne			1
@entity48 believes that the coins may indicate that there were maritime trading routes connecting east @entity6 , @entity117 , @entity86 and the @entity118 over 1,000 years ago - much earlier than first thought			1
if this theory is proved correct it will mean that other civilisations discovered and made contact with @entity1 six centuries before the @entity31			0
this could mean the history of @entity1 needs to be rewritten			0
another theory suggests that the coins may have been washed ashore the @entity18 following a shipwreck			0
@entity48 's expedition in july may help scientists and archaeologists discover how the coins arrived in @entity1			0
he will revisit the location marked with an ' x ' on @entity51 's map , as well as look for a secret @entity26 cave			0
the cave is said to be near @entity51 's beach and is thought to be filled with other treasures .			0

coins found date back as early as the 900s - six centuries before @entity23 claimed the island for the @entity25 throne in 1770
they were thought to have originated from a former @entity81 sultanate in @entity83 , near modern - day @entity91
