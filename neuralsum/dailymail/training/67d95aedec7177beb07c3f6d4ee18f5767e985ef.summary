@entity0 have given their much - vaunted loan striker @entity1 until april to prove himself in the @entity2 before deciding whether to sign him on a permanent basis			1
the 28 - year - old @entity4 has effectively been placed on a four - month trial after @entity0 agreed with his parent club @entity8 that should be the cut - off point in sorting out the player 's future			1
@entity0 are prepared to be patient with £ 265,000 - a - week @entity1 who they believe is one of the few genuinely world - class centre - forwards out there			1
they are satisfied that the anterior cruciate damage to his left knee sustained in january – causing @entity1 to miss eight months including the @entity33 - is healed			1
but predictably after such a long lay - off , he has suffered other injuries since joining @entity0 to huge fanfare in the summer			1
@entity0 agreed to pay his club @entity8 an initial £ 6million loan fee with the option of making a £ 50million move permanent later on			1
@entity1 is being monitored closely by @entity15 who ca n't afford any passengers as he bids to take @entity0 back to the summit of @entity43 football within his three - year contract			1
@entity45 is anxious to see if @entity1 can get back to the level of match - sharpness he believes is required in @entity43 football and says he will have no hesitation picking the superstar forward for under - 21 development games if necessary			1
' you have to be fit			2
that ’s why players have to play in the second team , like @entity1 , in spite of his name , ' said the @entity0 boss			1
the player , meanwhile , has been spending extra time in the gym with physios and doing pilates to improve his physical condition			2
@entity64 ( top ) and @entity66 ( right ) celebrate a goal in @entity0 's home win against @entity22 @entity0 manager @entity15 praised the influence @entity64 has had as captain while injuries have decimated his defence and midfield , @entity15 and @entity0 are spoilt for choice further up the field			1
even with @entity27 facing criticism after some games , @entity64 has responded well to the captaincy and big things are expected of teenager @entity80			0
the @entity81 says he has been pleasantly surprised by the dedication shown by @entity64 , who he knew only by reputation before taking the @entity0 job			1
' from the first day he was not the @entity64 that people have talked about him			0
he is my captain now , because he is the right example in training , ' said the manager			0
' i have the impression that he lives for football , and that he likes being captain of @entity0 and this team			1
' i have to remind you that i put him first as captain			0
( @entity100 ) @entity99 followed my advice ! ' i can make him even better			0
i 'm sorry , but i can make every player better			0
that ’s arrogant but i can			0
' @entity45 has also thrown down the gauntlet to midfielder @entity105 who has not played since @entity0 's goalless draw at @entity107 in august			1
the club are prepared to write off the £ 18million midfielder in january but will not pay up his contract to see him go , meaning other clubs will have to match his £ 60,000 - a - week wages , something @entity114 clubs are loathe to do			2
@entity45 said that midfielder @entity105 has returned to training and that he wants him to get fitter @entity45 ( centre ) pictured alongside assistant @entity118 ( right ) and @entity22 manager @entity119 ( left ) @entity45 has said @entity105 has not been fit enough for him to be considered for selection but revealed he has returned to training with the first - team and has to show better stamina and energy levels on a consistent basis			1
the midfielder has been criticised in other quarters for his lifestyle off the pitch and has been the subject of jokes of other @entity0 players about his eating habits			2
@entity45 said : ' he ’s now coming back			0
he was injured but he ’s training now with the team			0
i can not say what had happened last year but in my four months here , he ’s had a lot of injuries			2
' so i can not judge him but when he trains he trains at a good level			0
he ’s not always fit and that is more his problem now			2
' i ca n't pick him now because you have to be fit			0
for the first three months the culture of a trainer is fitness			2
that is the smallest thing you can demand			0
fitness is the most important thing			0
first you have to show your fitness			0
not for just one day but for several weeks			0

@entity1 returned from injury as @entity0 beat @entity22 3 - 0
@entity0 want the striker to prove his injury troubles are over
@entity1 was out for eight months earlier in the year with a knee problem
