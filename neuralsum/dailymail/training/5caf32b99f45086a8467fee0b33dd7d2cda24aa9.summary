by @entity0 @entity1 : 18:32 est , 19 december 2013 @entity2 : 18:34 est , 19 december 2013 @entity3 says her wedding day last month was ' the best moment ' of her life but there was one thing troubling her throughout ; the dead five - month - old baby inside her tummy			1
the author , 42 , from @entity12 , who had been undergoing ivf treatment with her partner @entity14 for two years , found out her fetus ' heart had stopped shortly before her big day			1
in a candid first person piece for @entity18 , she revealed that she was unable to book a medical abortion before her november 9 nuptials and was terrified of miscarrying ' all over ' her bridal gown at the alter			2
traumatic experience : @entity3 , 42 , ( right ) from @entity12 , who had been undergoing ivf treatment with her partner @entity14 ( left ) for two years , found out her fetus ' heart had stopped shortly before her wedding day - she later underwent an abortion ' i wanted this clot of cells taken out of me so i could go on with my life , ' she recalled			1
she and ms @entity31 opted for a ' two mom ' approach , allowing them to share the biological role in parenthood			2
to do this doctors mixed ms @entity31 's eggs in a lab dish with donor sperm and then implanted the embryo in ms @entity3 's uterus			1
the same - sex couple underwent the procedure in july , and doctors confirmed the two women were expecting a baby			1
however , five months later ms @entity3 learned the undeveloped child had died			1
recounting the harrowing experience , she wrote : ' i did n’t have sentimental feelings about it ; once i learned it did n’t have a heartbeat and had stopped developing weeks ago i ’d ceased thinking of it as my future child who will grow up			1
' [ instead , i ] had begun regarding it as a strange , gelatinous bit of sea life that had washed up on the shores of my uterus			0
' at her wedding there were several guests who asked about her pregnancy because they had n't received ' the text ' announcing the news			2
indeed , ms @entity3 wrote : ' my friend @entity70 hissed , “ are you pregnant ? ” ' poor @entity70 , nobody must have sent her the text ! i actually did n’t mind telling her			1
i was , but i ’m miscarrying right now			0
“ oh , girl ! ” i know , i nodded			0
' but @entity70 was n't the first make the mistake , and ms @entity3 said she was constantly asked about her prominent baby bump - merely the result of a ' mass of cells ' and ' months of constipation			1
' five days after her wedding she underwent an abortion			1
she said the procedure was delayed partly because of her ' hectic schedule ' and also because she discovered the clinic near her is only open two days a week			0
' once i learned it did n’t have a heartbeat and had stopped developing weeks ago i 'd ceased thinking of it as my future child who will grow up ' ' how in the world can that be enough to accommodate all the ladies in @entity12 that need abortions ? ' she exclaimed			1
the entire visit from start to finish took around four hours			0
ms @entity3 said there was lots of ' waiting around and the termination itself only took around five to ten minutes			1
after being administered some ' novocaine - like stuff ' to numb her cervix doctors explained that she might start feeling dizzy or nauseous or get a metallic taste in her mouth			2
recalling what happened next , she wrote : ' after a couple hours it was finally time for me to don my assless smock and climb onto the table			2
' it was so awesome that @entity14 could stand beside me the whole time , holding my hand and looking into my eyes			1
her face is my most favorite thing on the planet			0
' while she was ' super doped up ' doctors tried to distract her from what was going on with a ' steady stream of inane chatter			0
' ms @entity3 continued : ' the pressure to engage was sort of exhausting			1
i was so doped up i did n’t want to talk			0
if i made any sort of noise someone – or all of them – would quickly ask if i was in pain			0
no , no , no pain			0
but i could feel a terrible tugging deep inside , a yanking			0
' she said she was glad when the procedure was over and she was free to go home			0
the accomplished author , poet and literary arts organizer previously told @entity138 that she first experienced ' some sort of biological alarm clock ' when she was about 27 years old			2
but at the time she was n't ' intellectually interested ' in having a child and also described herself as a ' dirt - poor alcoholic			2
' after meeting ms @entity31 in her late thirties she felt ready to start a family			0
she has been documenting her pregnancy journey as part of a regular column for @entity18 since november 2011 .			0
