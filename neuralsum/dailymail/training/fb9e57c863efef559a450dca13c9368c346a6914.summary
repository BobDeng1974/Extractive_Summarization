shocking : christian woman @entity0 , pictured , has seen her appeal against the death sentence denied a @entity5 @entity4 woman has been sentenced to hang after she was accused of making ' blasphemous ' comments about the prophet @entity7 during an argument			1
while working as a berry picker in 2009 , 46 - year - old @entity0 got into a dispute with a group of @entity13 women who objected to her drinking their water because as a @entity4 she was considered ' unclean '			1
hours after the incident one of the women reported mother - of - five ms @entity0 to a local cleric , claiming she had made disparaging remarks about the prophet @entity7 during the row			1
as a result of the allegations , a furious mob arrived at ms @entity0 's home and savagely beat her and members of her family			1
she was later arrested , charged with blasphemy and eventually sentenced to death - with her entire family forced to go into hiding after receiving threats on their lives			2
this week , despite international outrage and hundreds of thousands of people signing a petition for her release , ms @entity0 lost an appeal to have her sentence overturned , meaning she now faces death by hanging			1
the shocking case hit global headlines after two prominent politicians who tried to help ms @entity0 were assassinated , one by his own bodyguard			1
lawyers showered the killer with rose petals when he appeared in court and the judge who convicted him of murder had to flee the country			0
ms @entity0 's lawyer , @entity52 , said her accusers have contradicted themselves many times since first raising their complaint			1
two witnesses allegedly involved in the incident did not appear in court , he said			0
a muslim prayer leader did appear , saying he did not witness the original altercation , but that ms @entity0 had confessed to the supposed crime in front of him			1
speaking of ms @entity0 's failed appeal against her death sentence , mr @entity52 said : ' i was expecting the opposite decision			1
we will file an appeal to the @entity70 in a few days			0
' but @entity71 , the lawyer for the complainant , said the court 's decision was correct			0
' @entity76 's lawyer tried to prove that the case was registered on a personal enmity but he failed to prove that , ' he said			0
support : @entity81 , husband of @entity0 , along with his daughters @entity83 , second left , and @entity84 , left , speak to @entity5 minister of minority affairs @entity85 , right			2
he was later murdered human rights groups say @entity5 's blasphemy law is increasingly exploited by religious extremists as well as ordinary @entity5 to settle personal scores			0
the law does not define blasphemy and evidence might not be reproduced in court for fear of committing a fresh offence			0
there are also no penalties for false accusations			0
those accused are sometimes lynched on the spot			0
if they are arrested , police and the courts often allow trials to drag on for years , as in the case of ms @entity0			1
the delays tend to be caused because officials are afraid of being physically attacked if they release anyone they feel had been wrongly accused of blasphemy			2
only one person has been executed since @entity5 imposed a de facto moratorium on executions in 2008			0
this year has seen a record number of blasphemy cases as well as increasing violence against the accused			2
mrs @entity0 - a farm worker from rural @entity116 - released a memoir called ' @entity118 ' last year , in which she described her torment at not knowing how long she has left to live			2
talking about how she ended up being accused of blasphemy , she says : ' i drank water from a well belonging to @entity13 women , using ' their ' cup , in the burning heat of the midday sun. worried : the daughters of mrs @entity0 pose with an image of their mother who faces death by hanging the crime of blasphemy was sealed into @entity5 law under @entity138 rule but strengthened during the years of military dictator @entity139 , who died in a plane crash in 1988			1
in recent years , however , the country - which is 96 per cent @entity13 - has seen a surge in accusations of insulting @entity144 , says @entity146 - based think - tank , the @entity147			1
but many analysts see the claims as score - settling or a front for property grabs , and in fact have nothing to do with @entity144			2
if found guilty , defendants can expect the death penalty			0
the charges are hard to fight because the law does not define blasphemy so presenting the evidence can sometimes itself be considered a fresh infringement			2
it can also be very difficult to find a lawyer willing to defend those accused of the crime			0
@entity118 carries the death penalty in @entity5 but the accused are often lynched or languish for years in jail without trial because lawyers are too afraid to defend them			0
judges have previously been attacked in @entity5 for acquitting blasphemy defendants and two politicians who discussed reforming the law were shot dead			0
' i , @entity0 , have been sentenced to death because i was thirsty			2
i 'm a prisoner because i used the same cup as those @entity13 women , because water served by a @entity4 woman was regarded as unclean by my stupid fellow fruit - pickers			1
' in the book , mrs @entity0 describes how - tired of being considered a second - class citizen simply because of her religion and insulted by constant calls for her to convert to @entity144 - she decided to stand up to the crowd and defend @entity189			1
pushing and shoving ensued , forcing ms @entity0 to flee the scene			1
when she returned to work five days later she was attacked again , but this time the crowd were accusing her of having insulted the @entity7			0
battered and bruised , ms @entity0 was dragged before the local @entity144 teacher who told her the only way she could redeem herself was by converting to @entity144			1
otherwise , he said , she would face death			2
in november 2010 ms @entity0 was sentenced to death in a @entity198 law court , becoming the first woman in @entity5 's history to be given the death penalty for blasphemy			1
over the past four years ms @entity0 has languished in the high - security @entity203 , 22 miles north - west of @entity205 , before being moved to a more remote prison			1
officials now make her cook her own food every day because they fear that ms @entity0 has so many enemies - within both the prison population and its staff - that she is at serious risk of poisoning			1
anger : protesters hold up placards while demanding the release of mrs @entity0 at a rally in @entity205 in 2010 ms @entity0 's death sentence has drawn international outrage from human rights groups , including @entity222 who say @entity5 's blasphemy laws amount to form of religious persecution			1
on news that ms @entity0 's appeal against her conviction had been overturned , @entity226 , @entity138 director of @entity227 , said : ' this is the latest blasphemy outrage to come out of @entity5			1
it seems obvious that this is a case of religious persecution , and it ’s very likely the result of a squabble which escalated out of all proportion			0
' ' @entity118 accusations in @entity5 are often used to settle petty vendettas and persecute minority groups			0
it ’s a complete disgrace that the courts are complicit in these vendettas			0
' meanwhile a spokesperson for @entity244 said : ' @entity246 ’s sentence is a tragic reminder of the continued abuse of the dysfunctional blasphemy laws and the underlying weaknesses in @entity5 's justice system			0
' ' deeply - rooted problems of prejudice , inefficiency , corruption , and under - resourcing are amplified in blasphemy cases , and even more so for religious minorities , ' the spokesperson added			0
' the only hope she has for justice is when the case is heard in the @entity70 , and we urge chief justice @entity265 to consider @entity246 ’s case with the utmost urgency , ' they went on to say			0
pope @entity268 publicly called for clemency for ms @entity0 , describing his ' spiritual closeness ' with her and urging that ' human dignity and fundamental rights of everyone in similar situations ' be respected			2
her case also attracted the attention of a number of online petitions calling for her release , one of which attracted over 400,000 signatures from the citizens of over 100 countries .			0
