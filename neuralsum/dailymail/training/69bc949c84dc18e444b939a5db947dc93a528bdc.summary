@entity1 ’s population is soaring by more than any other country in the @entity3 and a third of the increase is caused by immigration			1
the latest figures from @entity8 show that the number of people in the @entity1 rose by almost three times the @entity3 average in 2012 with 392,000 more than the year before – putting the total population at 63.888million			1
more than a third of that increase – 38 per cent or 148,700 people – was down to immigration			0
the rest was ‘ natural change ’ , with 243,900 more people being born than having died			2
getting crowded : @entity1 is already the most densely populated country in @entity19 - the population now stands at 63,888,000 the number of live births in @entity1 was 813,000 in 2012 , the second highest number in @entity19 , to @entity24 where 822,000 were born			1
and in @entity26 , the number of people dying in 2012 outnumbered births by almost 200,000			2
@entity29 rebel @entity28 ’s attempts to bring forward a referendum on @entity3 membership ended in humiliation yesterday when just 15 @entity33 voted for it			0
his amendment would have forced @entity1 to the polls on the issue next year – instead of the 2017 date preferred by @entity38			2
the millionaire @entity40 mp , who ignored a letter from 140 @entity29 mps urging him to drop the move , said his defeat would help @entity45			0
he now backs a 2017 poll suggested in a @entity47 by @entity29 backbencher @entity48 – and supported by the prime minister			0
the figures bring the @entity1 's total population to 63,888,000			1
this very high birth rate does much account for the population growth which is almost three times the @entity3 average			0
@entity54 , chief executive of campaign group @entity55 , said the figures represented a growing problem especially given that @entity1 is already the @entity19 's most densely populated country			1
he said : ' @entity58 is already @entity19 ’s most densely populated country			0
why should we also have @entity19 ’s highest population growth rate ? more people make things worse , ' if we are serious about tackling the many issues we face as a society , we need to address one of the principal underlying causes , which is population growth			2
' the second fastest growing @entity3 country is @entity24 with 305,500 more people in 2012 , 82 per cent of which were accounted for by a rise in births - their total population now stands at 65,633,200			1
rising tensions : coverage of groups of @entity77 camping in @entity79 's parks provoked fresh debate over the role of immigrants in what many feel is already and overcrowded country while immigration is a major political controversy in @entity1 , the increase in population caused by new immigrants arriving of just under 149,000 was less than half of the immigrants entering @entity26 , 391,000 and in @entity92 , 369,00			1
many point out that without immigration , the @entity3 ’s total population would be stagnant or in decline - it grew by just over one million people in 2012 , 882,000 of whom were migrants			1
one cause for continued migration is the economic crisis in the eurozone which has led to a contraction in the population of some countries as the young and unemployed move elsewhere to improve their chances in life			0
@entity110 was highest in @entity111 during 2012 , where 35,000 people left the country			0
high rates of emigration were also recorded in @entity117 , @entity118 , @entity119 , @entity120 , @entity121 , and @entity122 .			0

one third of the increase was down to immigrants but the other cause is that 243,900 more **babies** were born last year than people died
the number of live births in @entity1 was 813,000 in 2012 , the second highest number in @entity19 - only beaten by @entity24 where 822,000 **babies** were born
the figures bring the @entity1 's total population to 63,888,000
