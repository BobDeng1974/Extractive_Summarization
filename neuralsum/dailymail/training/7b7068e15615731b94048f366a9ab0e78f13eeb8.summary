a @entity1 pig farmer has come up with a new twist on ' grass - fed ' meat by feeding his animals left over leaf trim from a nearby marijuana farm			1
@entity7 , owner of the @entity8 in @entity9 , came up with the idea after the owners of a weed dispensary told him they had extra stems , stalks and leaves to get rid of			1
@entity14 was legalised in @entity1 last year , leading to an explosion in production			1
but it is usually only the buds - the most psychoactive parts of the plant - which are consumed			0
the rest of the plants are usually thrown out , or made into compost			0
mr @entity36 's ' @entity50 ' , as he calls them , have already proved a hit with customers , with meat selling out before the batches are even processed , @entity49 reports			0
' i feed them marijuana for the last two months of their lives , and they 've been happy , happy as hell , ' he told the news network			2
despite the relatively weak effects of the cannabis leaf trimmings , he says pigs just lie around , barely lifting their heads - much like human stoners			1
happy as a pig in ... pigs which are being raised on the unusual diet , which makes them gain weight faster it 's party time ! a farm labourer mixes up the special brew containing cannabis leaf trim , beer and vodka that might be a reason for his remarkable finding that the animals that eat the dope gain weight 20 per cent faster than those fed on more conventional diets - even though they consume the same amount overall			1
the fast weight gain leads to a more marbled and fatty texture to the free - range pork , which usually goes on to be processed into products like bacon and prosciutto			0
mr @entity36 , who refrains from smoking the herb himself , told @entity49 that customers taking part in ' blind bacon tests ' described the meat as ' more savoury '			2
' the flavour of the fat is extraordinary , [ customers ] love the marbling of the fat , ' he said			0
it is not the first time the enterprising pig farmer has experimented with unusual feeds for his animals			2
he also adds beer and even vodka to their troughs , bringing whole new meaning to the phrase ' party animals ' .			0

@entity7 feeds his pigs with leftover cannabis leaf trim
marijuana was legalised in @entity1 last year after a *public* vote
customers say the feed makes the animals taste ' more savoury '
