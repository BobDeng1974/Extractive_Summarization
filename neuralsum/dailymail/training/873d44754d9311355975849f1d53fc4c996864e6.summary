a @entity1 connection is one of the many thing that unites them – one has always been made to feel like the @entity4 in @entity5 - the closest thing the country has ever had to its most famous @entity8			2
while the other used to be the son - in - law of @entity11 married to @entity1 's daughter @entity12			0
they are like brothers when they meet up with the @entity15 national team and both would have loved to have played for the same club side			0
but on tuesday @entity18 and @entity19 will be the best of enemies as they face each other at the @entity23			1
it was just two weeks ago when , despite the proximity of tuesday ’s match , @entity19 made the most of a free - weekend created by @entity29 ’s elimination from the @entity30 to fly with partner @entity31 to @entity32 and spend the weekend with @entity18 and his girlfriend @entity33			1
@entity19 and @entity18 are very good friends but will be opposite sides on tuesday night @entity18 and @entity19 at @entity36 ahead of @entity5 's game with @entity38 at @entity39 in 2014 the girlfriends are close , as are the sons			1
@entity18 ’s son @entity43 was given a baby - argentina full strip by @entity19 shortly after he was born and @entity18 is like a godfather to @entity46 , the son @entity19 had with @entity12			1
@entity18 wrote the foreward to @entity19 ’s recent autobiography and if @entity18 and @entity33 finally get married this summer , as has been speculated , then @entity19 would be short odds to be his best man – once the pair have gone about the business of trying to win the @entity53 in @entity54 this june			2
their talent has brought them together on the international stage but the two men had very different beginnings			0
aged 15 , @entity19 was making his debut in the merciless @entity15 first division for the club he had always supported , @entity63			0
both @entity19 and @entity18 have been in good goalscoring form for their teams this season @entity18 was already at @entity32 ’s @entity68 youth academy at the time living the dream of playing alongside @entity70 and @entity72 training in the shadow of the @entity74 with aspirations of making it to the first team one day			1
@entity19 had grown up in the tough @entity79 neighbourhood – a densely populated criss - cross of dark alleys and narrow streets where 50,000 of @entity5 ’s poorest people tried to eke out a living and where he shared a two - bedroom corrugated iron and concrete prefab with father @entity87 , mother @entity88 and six siblings			2
@entity18 comes from slightly more affluent beginnings and it was a distant relative in @entity92 that helped enable him and his father @entity94 to travel to the @entity96 capital when the boy was just 13 and take a trial with one of the biggest clubs in world football			0
@entity18 runs out to train at the @entity23 on the eve of @entity32 's clash with @entity29 @entity18 and @entity72 share a joke and looked relaxed during training their very different paths eventually converged in 2005 at the @entity108 in @entity109			1
in the pre-tournament squad meet - up legend has it that @entity19 became a figure of fun in the team canteen when he failed to recognize @entity18 , who had already become the most famous young footballer on the planet			1
@entity19 asked ‘ who ’s that ? ’ to the amazement of his team - mates and when the two players were finally introduced their first conversion involved @entity19 commenting that his middle name @entity87 was the same ( more or less ) as @entity18			1
perhaps @entity18 was already getting sick of being noticed and , delighted that the other had not recognised him , took to @entity19 immediately			2
@entity19 ( right ) prepares for the @entity32 game with @entity127 and @entity128 @entity19 ( centre ) and @entity130 ( right ) share a joke as manager @entity132 watches on they became pals as @entity5 won the tournament beating @entity136 in the final with @entity18 scoring twice and @entity19 playing the last half an hour as a substitute			1
the won @entity142 gold together in @entity143 in 2008 and are room - mates at every tournament for their country			0
when @entity19 moved to @entity147 they began to play against each other with various meeting between their respective sides that usually ended with @entity18 coming out on top			2
@entity19 would invariably find the back of the net in defeat however – he scored five goals in 12 meetings against @entity32			0
@entity18 has the better of @entity19 when the pair met while both playing in @entity158 the front of @entity158 papers @entity161 and @entity162 preview tuesday 's game in total @entity18 has won eight of the 11 encounters between the two players			1
but those meetings all came when @entity19 was still at @entity147			0
last year he was injured and never faced his great friend			0
the question both will be asking now is : ‘ will the script change with @entity19 in the sky blue of @entity29 ? ’			0

@entity5 team - mates @entity18 and @entity19 will line up on opposite sides when @entity32 travel to @entity29
in the 11 games between the pair - all in @entity158 - @entity18 has been on the winning side eight times
@entity29 face @entity32 in the @entity183 last 16
