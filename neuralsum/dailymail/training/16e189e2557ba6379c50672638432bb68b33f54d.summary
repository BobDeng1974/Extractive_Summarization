by @entity0 the figures show that some people in a position of trust including teachers and doctors are not being prosecuted for child sex offences people in a position of trust , such as teachers , doctors and carers , are being let off with cautions for child sex offences , fresh data has shown			1
two care workers were cautioned for sexual activity with a person with a mental disorder and four offenders in a position of trust were cautioned for sexual activity with a child , in a year			1
a total of nine offenders who were in a position of trust were cautioned for abuse between 2011 and 2012			2
cautions were issued for a wide range of sexual offences including eight rapes , 15 rapes of a child under 13 and 254 cases of sexual activity with a child			1
the data revealed that one offender in a position of trust was cautioned for making a child watch a sexual act			1
the information was requested by @entity42 , @entity43 mp for @entity44 , in @entity45			0
minister for prisons and rehabilitation @entity46 said the @entity48 launched a review in april into the use of cautions , which will examine whether there are some offences for which the use of cautions is inappropriate			2
he said : ' court will always be the right place for serious and contested cases and those involving prolific offenders			2
' the use of cautions is at its lowest level for more than five years , as is the number of cautions issued to those who have a previous criminal record			0
' however , there will be a number of difficult cases , including those where both victim and perpetrator are children , or where victims and witnesses are reluctant to give evidence , where the police may decide that administering a caution is a preferable option to there being no record of the offence committed			0
' 12 offenders were cautioned for causing a person to engage in sexual activity without consent , while 34 were cautioned for causing or inciting a child under 13 to engage in sexual activity			1
the figures showed 116 offenders were cautioned for causing or inciting a child under 16 to engage in sexual activity , while 51 people were cautioned for causing or inciting prostitution for gain			1
mp @entity42 ( left ) requested the information and questioned when cautions are appropriate			0
justice minister @entity46 ( right ) has launched an investigation into the use of cautions the figures showed 10 offenders were cautioned for meeting a child following sexual grooming , while 65 were cautioned for sexual assault of a child under 13			2
mr @entity42 said : ' whilst there are some examples where it would clearly be appropriate for a caution to be issued , others are clearly questionable			0
of particular concern are those that involve people in positions of trust committing sex offences , of one kind or another , against children and rape offences ' ' this matter needs to dealt with urgently to reassure the public that those who commit these offences are subjected to appropriate severe action			0
in many of these cases , a caution would not meet that test			0
