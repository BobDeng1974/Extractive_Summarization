with @entity1 downing a caffeine - shake - inducing average of 70 million cups of coffee per day , @entity0 has revealed a secret that the nation may want take note of - how to get a free cup			1
@entity9 , chief executive of the coffee giant , revealed he has given his staff the power to hand out a coffee on the house to people they like or fancy			1
' the staff have to give away a certain number of hot drinks and food every week , ' mr @entity9 said			2
here she is after failing to secure a freebie at their @entity32 store ' they will decide " i like the person on the bicycle " or " i like the guy in that tie " or " i fancy that girl or that boy			2
" so , do the staff at @entity0 ever take advantage of their enabled good will ? and what does it take to secure a free morning caffeine hit ? @entity23 decided to find out			1
@entity22 , 24 , paid a visit to six different @entity49 across @entity25			2
on three of the visits , she wore no make - up , her glasses and a casual outfit consisting of jeans and a plain top			1
before paying a visit to the next three coffee shops , she amped up the glamour by removing her glasses , applying a full face of make - up and donning a little red dress with a fair share of cleavage and leg on show			1
@entity22 then returned to @entity67 to find out whether she could bag a free coffee in her glam getup - and went into the @entity71 branch twice to find out if the result would differ depending on whether it was a man or woman serving			1
here 's how @entity22 - who did n't tell the staff she was a journalist until after she had been handed her drink - got on ... @entity22 , dressed ' plainly ' , fails to get a free coffee at @entity0 in @entity67 ( l ) and @entity78 @entity22 paid a visit to @entity0 's @entity67 , @entity78 and @entity81 outlets , where she tried three different approaches : nonchalant , sad and friendly			1
dressed in her casual attire , she popped into @entity67 's @entity0 just as she normally would : making little effort but still being polite			2
she left with a coffee - and a dent in her purse			2
at @entity78 's shop , she decided to put her acting skills to good use			0
she said : ' it was a fellow female who served me , she was really glamorous herself and i just figured that flirting was out of the question here			0
' so , i went for the " sad " approach			0
i told her how bad my day had been and asked her how she was but while she smiled a lot , she still charged me			0
feeling annoyed , i paid and left			0
' at the @entity81 shop , @entity22 was feeling lucky			2
makeup - free @entity22 gets a free hot chocolate from friendly barista , @entity100 , at @entity0 , @entity81 she said : ' as soon as i walked in , i had a feeling i would get a free coffee			1
i just felt more confident and the barista guy looked cool			0
it was n't busy so i thought it could work			0
' i smiled but did n't try hard and asked how he was			0
it worked as he called me sweetie ! ' i asked for a small hot chocolate and did n't get my purse out			0
he handed it to me and said " happy @entity114 ; do n't worry about it "			0
' @entity22 then revealed that she was a journalist on a mission and asked him to divulge the reason why he gave her a free coffee - and how other people can get one , too			1
@entity22 fails to get a free coffee at @entity0 , @entity32 @entity22 returns to @entity71 and manages to bag a free cookie ' the main reason i give out free things - and i have no quota and give out around 300 a month - is when someone is nice , ' he explained			1
' i am not impressed by the ladies who come in and flirt , batting their eyelids and twirling their hair , nor those who are grumpy and take it out on the staff			0
' @entity22 then swapped her casual clothes for her ' glamorous ' look and headed to @entity32 , where she had to pay for a hot chocolate from a female barista			1
the same thing happened at @entity71 on her first visit			0
she decided to try her luck again , this time making sure she got served by a male barista , who gave her a free cookie because of her ' beautiful smile '			1
@entity22 asks @entity144 to recommend a cake - and in the end she decides on a cookie @entity22 with @entity144 , who gave her a free cookie at @entity0 , @entity71 she managed to wangle a free mocha in victoria station 's @entity0 from a chap named @entity152 , who wanted to ' make her day '			1
finally , to round off the day , she went back to @entity67 to try get a freebie dressed a bit more glamorous - but was made to pay for her espresso			2
the verdict ? @entity22 said : ' the glam outfit got me more freebies but i do n't think it 's all about that			1
' as @entity100 said , he 's not interested in giving out freebies to girls who come in batting their eyelashes and twirling their hair nor those who come in in a bad mood and take it out on him			0
' so do n't try to flirt a freebie off a barista or try to make them feel sorry for you - it 's all about radiating happiness , a wide smile , and spreading the joy			2
' although as the experiment shows - a little red dress wo n't hurt ... ! ' @entity22 gets a free mocha from @entity152 at @entity0 , @entity181 @entity22 tries @entity0 , @entity67 , once more - this time in the red dress - and still nothing in response to @entity23 's undercover work , a spokesperson for @entity0 said : ' the giveaways are something we ’ve been doing for a number of years , and have never been a secret			1
' we often get feedback from customers about how our shop teams have really brightened up their day , just through one small gesture of giving them a treat on the house			0
' there are n’t any rules , it ’s about random acts of kindness			0
team members tell us they often give away treats to their regulars and customers they think are in need of cheering up			0
it ’s our way of empowering our team members and giving something back to our loyal customers , and we get great feedback from both			0
