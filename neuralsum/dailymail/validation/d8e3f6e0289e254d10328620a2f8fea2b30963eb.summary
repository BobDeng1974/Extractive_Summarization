the @entity0 is weighing a free - speech challenge to @entity3 's refusal to issue a license plate bearing the @entity6 battle flag			1
specialty plates are big business in @entity3 , where drivers spent $ 17.6million last year to choose from among more than 350 messages the state allows			1
the state 's @entity12 says nearly 877,000 vehicles among more than 19million cars , pickup trucks and motorcycles registered in @entity3 carry a specialty plate			1
but a state motor vehicle board turned down a request by the @entity3 division of the @entity22 for a license plate with its logo bearing the battle flag , similar to plates issued by eight other states that were members of the @entity6 , as well as @entity29			1
pictured above is the design of a proposed @entity22 license plate			0
the @entity0 will weigh a free - speech challenge to @entity3 's decision to refuse to issue a license plate bearing the @entity6 battle flag the justices are hearing arguments on monday over whether the state violated the group 's first amendment rights			1
@entity3 commemorates the @entity6 in many ways , but it says that putting the battle flag on license plates would offend many @entity44 who believe the flag is a racially charged symbol of repression			2
the same image is etched on a century - old @entity51 monument on the grounds of the state @entity53 in @entity55			0
the @entity57 dispute has brought together some unlikely allies , including the @entity59 , anti-abortion groups , @entity61 , civil libertarian @entity62 and conservative satirist @entity63			0
' in a free society , offensive speech should not just be tolerated , its regular presence should be celebrated as a symbol of democratic health â€” however odorous the products of a democracy may be , ' @entity62 , @entity63 and others said in a brief backing the group			0
sons of the @entity6 veterans claim that @entity3 is violating the group 's @entity57 right of freedom of speech by not allowing them to have their logo , bearing the battle flag , on license places ( file photo ) the case could be important for how the @entity0 determines whether the speech at issue belongs to private individuals or the government			1
@entity3 's main argument to the @entity0 is that the license plate is not like a bumper sticker slapped on the car by its driver			2
instead , the state said license plates are government property , and so what appears on them is not private individuals ' speech but the government 's			1
the @entity57 applies when governments try to regulate the speech of others , but not when governments are doing the talking			0
@entity22 claim on the group 's website that it ' is preserving the history and legacy of these heroes so that future generations can understand the motives that animated the @entity114 ' even if the court disagrees that license plates are government speech , the state said its rejection of the @entity22 license plate was not discriminatory			1
the motor vehicle board had not approved a plate denigrating the @entity6 or the battle flag so it could not be accused of giving voice to one viewpoint while suppressing another , the state said			0
the @entity59 suggested the court view license plates as a mix of private and government speech			0
for example , drivers who seek a personal touch and buy the specialized plates know the government has approved their issuance			0
eleven states are supporting @entity3 because they fear that a ruling against the state would call into question license plates that promote national and state pride and specific positions on such controversial issues as abortion			2
a decision in @entity146 v. @entity22 , 14 - 144 , is expected by late june .			2

nearly 877,000 vehicles of 19million registered in @entity3 carry specialty plate
