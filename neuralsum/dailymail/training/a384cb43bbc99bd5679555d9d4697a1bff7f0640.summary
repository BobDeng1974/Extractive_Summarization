@entity1 's first - ever senior competitive game ended in a 7 - 0 thumping by @entity3 in their opening @entity6 qualifying match on sunday night			1
@entity8 scored four , @entity7 fired in two and @entity9 also got onto the scoresheet in a predictably one - sided match at @entity12			1
@entity1 , @entity14 's newest member and a country with a population of around 30,000 , were accepted by the @entity18 governing body in may 2013 following a 14 - year battle			2
comfortable : @entity8 scored a four as @entity3 cruised to victory over @entity1 opener : @entity7 scored the opener with the help of a significant deflection struggle : @entity1 struggled against @entity3 's superior players , in particular @entity8 performance : @entity1 worked hard , and the locals were in fine voice , but the hosts were easily outclassed fans : @entity1 fans pose with their tickets outside the stadium before their @entity36 qualifier they face a tough test to progress from @entity6 with a team predominantly made up of amateurs , which has been made even more difficult following their opening result , as they have been drawn with @entity42 winners @entity43 , @entity3 , @entity44 , @entity45 and @entity46			1
@entity3 took the lead in the 10th minute through @entity7 's low strike to set the tone for the rest of the match			2
@entity1 's @entity52 tried his luck in the 21st minute but his shot flew over the bar as the home side struggled to make many chances against their experienced opponents			0
@entity59 striker @entity8 lined up a free - kick in a dangerous area just to the left of the edge of the 18 yard box but sent it wide			0
he then fired another attempt into the wall just before the break as @entity3 held onto their one - goal lead			0
group : @entity3 's comfortable victory puts them top of @entity6 on goal difference defending : the score could have been worse , were it not for the woodwork and a clearance off the line new : @entity1 have never competed in a @entity14 match before as they have only recently been recognised history : @entity1 have beaten countries like @entity82 but @entity3 is the most populated country they 've played difficult : @entity84 faces an uphill battle if his side are to qualify for their first ever @entity18 championships the visitors doubled their advantage early in the second half when @entity7 was given acres of time and space in the box as @entity1 's defence stood off and the @entity98 midfielder picked his spot			1
@entity8 added the third in the 50th minute when he headed in from close range after a long diagonal ball over to top from @entity7 to stun the home side			2
the 26 - year - old striker was then denied by keeper @entity104 - who works as a fireman - as he stood up and palmed away @entity8 's effort , but the forward did score his second and @entity3 's fourth of the match shortly after , when he slid the ball in after a neat one - two with @entity7 on the break			1
@entity9 then rose highest to head the fifth from a free - kick - meaning @entity3 had scored four within 10 second - half minutes			0
@entity8 squandered the chance to claim his hat - trick when he could not keep the ball down after trying to fire in from the right in the 80th minute but made no mistake five minutes later as he raced towards goal and coolly beat @entity104			0
the prolific forward added his fourth in the first minute of stoppage time to compound @entity1 's misery in what was a bittersweet arrival in international football			0
first : the national anthem is @entity125 but @entity1 sung a different song before kick - off competition : @entity1 have previously competed in the @entity130 , finishing runners - up in 1995 international : @entity1 were on the receiving end of @entity8 's first international hat - trick careers : @entity1 's national football team includes teachers , fire fighters and civil servants qualifiers : @entity3 have often performed well in qualifiers but disappointed in actual competitions group d : the other group members are @entity43 , @entity45 , @entity46 and the @entity44			1

@entity3 beat @entity1 7 - 0 in @entity145 qualifier
@entity8 scored a four and @entity7 a brace
@entity149 also got on the score - sheet
@entity84 's side worked hard but were easily *outplayed*
