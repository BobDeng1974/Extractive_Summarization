@entity0 was a self - confessed ‘ @entity5 addict ’ long before her employers took her to court – and even boasted about her love of flashy labels			1
in 2005 , the younger @entity0 sister admitted she had spent £ 30,000 in just two years on designer products from the auction website and said her shopping addiction was so serious , she ‘ needed help ’			1
@entity0 , then 25 , said : ‘ i was blown away by what you could buy – absolutely anything , from furniture to @entity16 bags , vintage clothes to holiday homes			1
@entity0 confessed to being an @entity5 addict in 2005 ‘ within a few months , i was hooked			1
i fell in love with designers such as @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity24 and @entity25			1
’ she had been working as a housekeeper for @entity27 and @entity28 since 2001 , when she joined her sister @entity29 , 41 , at their @entity31 property			1
@entity0 revealed how she became ‘ hooked ’ on making bids on @entity5 , comparing the thrill of winning a bid to ‘ driving a @entity36 ’			1
she said : ‘ then there was the second rush of excitement when i received my purchases			1
when they arrived , it felt like @entity42			1
‘ as the months went by , i bought items i did n’t really want simply because i could n’t bear the thought of anyone else getting them			1
’ the @entity48 home in @entity49 , @entity50 where the sisters will spend @entity42 with their family @entity0 described how her taste for designer goods led to out - of - control spending			1
‘ soon the temptation to blow my budget became too great and i started buying ridiculously expensive items			1
my biggest splurge was £ 700 on a pair of @entity24 glasses , @entity16 boots and a @entity22 scarf – all in one day			1
’ @entity0 claimed that her spending destroyed her relationship with her then boyfriend , who confronted her after finding bags full of expensive gear			1
‘ he was furious that i was spending money on clothes when i should have been saving up to buy my own flat , and our rows over my spending soon escalated , ’ she told the @entity69			1
‘ i never thought he ’d make me choose between him and @entity5 , but in the end he could n’t take any more			1
’ @entity0 said her passion for @entity5 developed into a dangerous ‘ addiction ’ that led to her boyfriend leaving her			1
‘ until he left , i did n’t think i had a problem			1
i reasoned that i did n’t drink , smoke or do drugs			1
but now i know my @entity5 addiction was just as strong as someone who is addicted to alcohol or gambling			1
’ @entity0 and @entity89 arriving at @entity90 during the case earlier this month on the surface at least , the contrast between this fashion - filled @entity96 life and the dilapidated streets of @entity49 , the sisters ’ home village in @entity99 , could hardly be greater			1
in the very ‘ toe ’ of @entity50 ’s ‘ boot ’ , it is a place of cracked roads , unfinished buildings and wandering farm animals			1
but there are luxury cars here , too , and high - end handbags , and £ 500 shoes on the feet of teenage girls despite the many potholes of the isolated village			1
because there is tremendous wealth in @entity49 , and it comes from its intimate connection with the feared @entity99 mafia , the ’ @entity118 , once famous for its kidnappings , now known for supplying drugs			1
so while @entity0 may blame @entity5 for her love affair with designer labels , it ’s just as likely that the sisters brought their luxurious tastes with them from their home town			1
there are fewer than 4,000 residents in @entity49 , and some 90 per cent are said to have mafia associations , including , according to one police source , three generations of @entity133			1
the sisters ’ father @entity136 served 15 years for his part in the gang that snatched @entity139 , a fashion store owner , from the streets of @entity141 in 1981			1
@entity27 leaving @entity90 after giving evidence at the case during the trial today @entity136 insists that he has served his time , is reformed and earns a legitimate living as a truck driver for the construction industry			1
he shares a modest flat with his frail wife and their youngest daughter on the outskirts of @entity141			1
speaking through the window of his black @entity156 , in his first comments since @entity29 and @entity0 were acquitted of a £ 685,000 credit card fraud against their former employers , he railed against the threat to their good name			1
‘ this story has damaged the reputation of my daughters			1
good job it went the way it did			1
i would have seen to it personally , otherwise			2
‘ my daughters were trapped between two people fighting			2
where were all the accountants , what were they doing ? ‘ if someone spends your money , you get rid of them			2
the credit cards were in the company name			2
‘ why did @entity27 keep them working for her for another four years ? i am an honest man			2
i have a record and have had problems with justice			2
but i have my own respectable business			2
i drive a truck , now			2
i did not need the money of the @entity191			2
i sent money to my girls			2
their bank accounts were frozen and they needed to pay for the lawyers			2
‘ they will be flying from @entity96 to @entity49 next week and we will spend @entity42 all together			2
’ local people say @entity136 , who spent much of @entity29 and @entity0 ’s early years in prison , encouraged them to live independent lives			2
‘ he never wanted them to become involved in the criminal life that has been the lifeblood of the village , ’ one woman said			2
‘ he was determined they would not follow the traditional route of being married off in some arranged dynastic mafia marriage			2
he encouraged them to travel abroad			2
’ @entity29 , who is known as @entity210 , was the first to leave			0
in 1992 , she applied for work as an au pair and spent four years in @entity213 , @entity96 , before returning to @entity50			0
in 1999 , both sisters sent cvs to a @entity96 au pair agency , and @entity29 ended up as a nanny with @entity27 , who was married to @entity219 journalist @entity218 , then dying of throat cancer			0
@entity0 , meanwhile , worked as an au pair with an @entity223 family living in @entity224 , @entity96 , before joining her sister in the @entity227 household			0
@entity228 , the eldest of the four @entity0 girls , remained in @entity49 , where she married locally			0
she is currently living in the family ’s four - storey house with her extended family of aunts , uncles , nieces and nephews			0
yesterday she expressed her delight at the outcome of the trial and said she was planning a family party to celebrate her sisters ’ homecoming			0
‘ i ’m so happy the people on the jury realised it was unfair and found them not guilty , ’ she said			0
‘ i ca n’t believe that after my sisters both sacrificed so much of their own lives to look after @entity27 , she turned against them			0
‘ my sisters were so devoted and worked such long hours that they have not found time for children of their own			0
‘ as far as i was concerned , they were let down			0
’ it is likely that the entire village will turn out to welcome its famous former residents			0
this notorious criminal hotspot , a centre of the drug trade , might seem a curious destination for @entity258 and @entity259 , @entity27 ’s children with @entity218			0
yet in the immediate aftermath of their father ’s death from throat cancer , this is where the @entity0 sisters brought them			0
‘ they took them here to help with the grieving , ’ says the sister ’s aunt , also called @entity0			0
‘ my niece adored those children and they came here a few times			0
’ but after the extraordinary revelations of recent weeks , it seems unlikely they will be returning			0
@entity280 was sentenced to 18 years in prison for his part in a kidnapping when fashion store owner @entity139 was snatched from the streets of @entity141 and bundled into the boot of a waiting car the only witness was a barking sausage dog called @entity290			0
it was four months before the 43 - year - old was freed by the @entity99 mafia , following payment of a ransom of almost £ 400,000			0
the 1981 kidnapping is testament to the terrible efficiency of the ’ @entity118 mob			0
it also offers a colourful insight into the background of @entity29 and @entity302 , whose father @entity136 was sentenced to 18 years in prison for his part in the crime			0
at the trial of @entity0 and 14 others , ms @entity139 explained the appalling conditions in which she was held			0
‘ i was blindfolded and tied to a camp bed , and with earplugs , ’ she said			0
‘ the sensory deprivation led to hallucinations and depression			0
’ at the time , kidnapping was the scourge of rich @entity50 and a major source of income for the mafia			0
the @entity322 ’ home town , @entity49 , was dubbed @entity50 ’s ‘ kidnap capital ’			0
the most famous victim was @entity325 , heir to one of the biggest fortunes in the world			0
seized in @entity330 in 1973 when he was 16 , his ear was chopped off and sent to his family to terrorise them into paying a multi-million - pound ransom			0
the ’ @entity118 mob is known these days for its expertise in drug trafficking			0
in 2003 , hundreds of police officers stormed @entity49 , arresting more than 100 villagers , including the @entity133 ’ uncle @entity340			0
police uncovered a vast labyrinth of underground tunnels , walkways and bunkers , used for hiding during raids , and to store and smuggle drugs			0
an investigation revealed there was a plan to spend public money on restoring the tunnels			0
the town council was dissolved and replaced by a special prefectoral commissioner due to deep mafia infiltration .			0
