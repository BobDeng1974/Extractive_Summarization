@entity0 have one job , and one job alone in @entity3 , this evening			1
with @entity7 having been humiliated at the hands of the @entity9 , @entity6 ’s team are now seen as the @entity11 favourites to win the @entity12 , and a good result against @entity14 is to be expected			1
at least it would be , if it were n’t for @entity4			2
the @entity18 strikes fear into opposition at the best of times , but for @entity0 , he is even more terrifying			2
it loosely translates as ' @entity0 ’s @entity28 '			1
as the @entity41 wrote today , ' @entity0 ’s chances of a good start to the @entity12 would improve dramatically if they can play @entity4 out of the game '			1
that is the popular view , and the reason why every tiny development on @entity4 ’s fitness has been meticulously recorded in the @entity48 media			2
@entity14 without @entity4 are there to be beaten			1
@entity14 with @entity4 are an equally matched opponent			1
on the ball : @entity4 's fitness has been scrutinised closely by the @entity48 media ahead of monday 's encounter decision time : @entity0 coach @entity6 is expected to play without natural full - backs against @entity14 in the zone : @entity0 squad train at @entity3 's @entity58 ahead of monday 's clash against @entity14 dynamic duo : @entity61 ( left ) and @entity62 ( right ) will face the threat of @entity4 out wide from the @entity48 camp itself , the situation is viewed differently			1
low sees the whole @entity14 side as ' the @entity68 in counter attacking ' , while @entity62 said this week that ' it ’s not @entity0 against @entity4 , it ’s @entity0 against @entity14 '			1
@entity61 was equally quick to play down fears of the @entity34 man , saying ' i ’ve faced him a lot of times in the @entity35 and for @entity0 before			1
it ’s not like i ’m sitting in my room all the time watching videos of him			0
' of course i ca n’t stop him on my own , ' @entity61 added , ' no defender can do that			0
we need to work together as a team to stop him '			0
put like that , there is room for optimism			0
history tells us that @entity0 are one of the most effective teams when it comes to stopping @entity4			1
the @entity93 has played against the @entity48 three times at a major tournament			0
on each occasion , @entity0 have won , and @entity4 has not found the net			1
@entity98 : monday 's front page of @entity48 newspaper @entity100 reads ' tonight we will make @entity4 look old ' @entity102 player : @entity6 's defensive plans will focus around neutralising the threat of @entity4 ( centre ) colossal figure : @entity0 centre - back @entity107 should start in the heart of their defence on monday up for it : @entity113 ( centre ) should partner @entity107 at the back in their @entity117 opener in some corners , there is optimism that this will happen again			1
this morning , the @entity121 tabloid @entity100 appeared with a slightly disturbing picture of @entity4 as an elderly man , with the headline ' today we will make @entity4 look old '			2
nevertheless , this is a different ronaldo to the one they have faced before			0
@entity0 can not simply rely on records to make sure his side are not tormented by the @entity132 winner			2
for all his attempts to play down @entity4 ’s influence , @entity6 knows this			1
his decision to fill the back line with natural centre backs , and thereby do without marauding full backs should stop spaces opening up behind the midfield for @entity4 to exploit			1
vital man : @entity142 will play a crucial role as @entity0 's midfield interceptor against @entity14 @entity142 will also play a key role as a defensive midfielder			1
as a creative force in that position , he has already proved himself			0
@entity149 and @entity14 ’s counter attacking game , the challenge will be to act as an interceptor			2
the right result this evening could define @entity0 ’s tournament			0
on paper , the team are certainly among the very best this @entity12 has to offer			0
their preparations , though , have been plagued by niggling psychological and physical issues			0
a host of injuries , a shaky defence , and the risk of only bringing one striker have been the main points of worry , and , at least among the public , there is tangible pessimism			0
worried : there are @entity48 public concerns that @entity172 is the only striker in their @entity12 squad the spirit in the camp is harder to gauge			0
while players like @entity178 , @entity142 and @entity179 show nothing but positivity to the watching public , the pressure is extremely high on this @entity0 team to finally deliver on their promise			2
it was that pressure , among other things , which saw them falter against @entity188 at @entity189			0
with favourites such as @entity193 , @entity7 and @entity194 all failing to convince in their opening games , @entity0 can send a message tonight			0
make @entity4 look old , and they will have earned the favourites tag			0
let themselves be tormented , and the torment may just ruin their tournament .			0

@entity0 face @entity14 in @entity3 on monday in their @entity26 opener
@entity14 captain @entity4 will pose @entity0 's *biggest* threat
ronaldo has been *dubbed* as the ' @entity28 ' by @entity0 press
@entity4 scored against @entity29 , @entity30 and @entity31 in last season 's @entity35 for champions @entity34
@entity0 coach @entity6 is expected to play without natural full - backs
@entity142 is expected to play in midfield as interceptor vs @entity14
