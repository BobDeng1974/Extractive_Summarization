the video then shows the now deflated airbag and tyres several feet away from where @entity16 is lying			1
as the young man groans and writhes in agony the video shows his friends continue to laugh			1
the airbag is attached by a wire to a nearby car engine - when it is inflated he is thrown violently in the air @entity16 and the airbag and tyres part company in this action shot which shows him falling towards the bushes @entity16 luckily lands in the bushes on the side of the pavement rather than the busy road to his left @entity63 , 24 , from @entity8 in @entity9 , posted the video on @entity12 , and said that @entity16 suffered a fractured lumbar vertebra in the incident			1

he said : ‘ we asked him if he wanted to do it and he said he was up for it			0
’ he said they had the idea after helping a friend remove the airbags from his van and they created the contraption with the tyres , airbags , some wood , a couple of bricks and some jump leads			2
mr @entity74 added they did not think @entity16 would have been seriously hurt in the incident			2
he said : ‘ we thought he would have bruised his coccyx , we did n’t expect him to break his back ! ‘ he said afterwards it would have been funnier if he had been standing up			2
