the latest space tourism venture aims to send paying customers to the edge of space and give them the same awe - inspiring view that adventurer @entity5 stared down upon last year - all for $ 75,000 a ticket			1
depending more on hot air than rocket science @entity9 start - up , @entity11 , has unveiled plans for a balloon ride to the stratosphere , offering passengers about two hours of space - like views from 19 miles above @entity17			1
while it 's not quite space — that starts at 62 miles — the plan requires approval from the @entity22 , which oversees commercial space			2
@entity30 , ceo of the @entity32 , @entity9 - based company , said the price for the four - hour ride would be $ 75,000 the company expects to begin flight tests of a demonstration vehicle this year in @entity9 and plans to start selling tickets at $ 75,000 per person within a few months , said @entity39 and president @entity30 - with commercial flights by 2016			1
' there are balloons this size that have already flown up many , many times for decades , ' @entity30 said			0
' from a technical point of view this is incredibly doable , low risk			0
' the selling point is the view of the @entity17 and seeing its curve , she said			0
the venture is n't designed for passengers to experience weightlessness			2
indeed , the flight will be more like that of @entity57 daredevil @entity5 , the @entity59 adventurer who leapt from a balloon 24 miles above the @entity17 , smashing the sound barrier during his descent and landing safely			1
dream flight : the selling point is the view of the @entity17 and seeing its curve , she said			2
the venture is n't designed for passengers to experience weightlessness lift - off : initially , six passengers and two pilots would be aboard a pressurized capsule that is still under development ' we promise we wo n’t open the door and have you jump back to @entity17 , ' @entity30 joked			1
the flight would take 90 minutes to go up at about 1,000 feet a minute , set sail up high for 2 hours with an emphasis on smooth riding , hit an altitude of 19 miles and then come back down in 40 minutes , @entity30 said			1
the capsule 's interior will be roomy enough for its eight passengers to walk around and even get a drink at an on - board bar - but unfortunately there will be experiencing of weightlessness			1
' seeing the @entity17 hanging in the ink - black void of space will help people realize our connection to our home planet and to the universe around us , and will surely offer a transformative experience to our customers , ' @entity30 , @entity11 's chief executive officer , said in a statement			1
the flight would take 90 minutes to go up at about 1,000 feet a minute , set sail up high for 2 hours with an emphasis on smooth riding , and then come back down in 40 minutes pilot @entity5 of @entity59 jumps out of the capsule during the final manned flight for @entity100 on october 14 , 2012 in space ' we look forward to pioneering this new , accessible and affordable spaceflight regime , and to sharing the breathtaking , once - in - a - lifetime experience with people from around the globe			1
' by comparison , rides aboard @entity106 – a suborbital six - passenger , two - pilot vehicle owned by @entity109 , an offshoot of @entity113 ’s @entity112 - based @entity111 – is expected to reach about 68 miles			1
at that altitude , passengers will experience a few minutes of weightlessness in addition to seeing the curvature of the @entity17 set against the black sky of space			1
@entity11 capsules would be propelled by a 40 million cubic - foot ( 1.1 million cubic - meter ) helium balloon and a steerable parafoil , an inflatable wing - shaped parachute - which would steer them gently to the ground once they disconnected from the giant helium balloon			1
outside magazine space expert @entity130 , a former @entity132 associate administrator now space policy director at @entity134 , agreed that this is technically feasible			0
pole position : @entity109 's @entity106 flies over the @entity137 in @entity138 as it continues its test flights ahead of its first commercial flight next year entrepreneur @entity113 takes a press conference on his decade - old @entity109 space project in 2012 he said the issue is whether there 's enough of a market for it to be financially doable , calling it ' an interesting market test			1
' @entity130 said the while there are many space tourism ventures , it is not quite right to call the field growing			0
a few people have paid tens of millions of dollars to fly to the @entity156 and others have paid to fly in high altitude jets			1
but how many people will pay for near space experiences , he asked			2
@entity30 said she has no doubt that there 's a market with other firms like @entity109 selling so many tickets for yet - to - fly rides			2
' space tourism is here to stay , ' said @entity30 , who also runs the space firm @entity169			0
@entity109 : headed by the charismatic @entity171 billionaire and adventurer @entity113 , @entity109 and their @entity173 became the highest commercial winged vehicle in september the spacecraft shot to 69,000 feet above the @entity17 's surface and the company claims it is on track to put paying customer 's into space in 2014 the @entity181 is launched from a large aeroplane , giving the spacecraft more initial speed and altitude than if it were launched from the ground			1
sir @entity113 first unveiled the rocket plane on december 7 , 2009 and 18 months later took selected people on short - hop trips just above the atmosphere			1
the @entity181 is 18 metres long and has two pilots and room for six passengers			2
tickets cost $ 250,000 per person and 600 have been sold up to june this year			0
celebrities who have snapped up tickets , include @entity197 , @entity198 , @entity199 , @entity200 and @entity201			0
passengers will experience approximately six minutes of weightlessness during the two - hour @entity204 : the @entity138 based firm are in developmental stages of a jet which will take its passengers from @entity209 to @entity210 in 2 hours			1
@entity211 claims its @entity213 spacecraft can travel at a speed of more than 2,500 mph - and dozens of miles above the earth - before safely landing at an airport			1
the @entity213 's main engines run with the help of flight weight rocket piston pump hardware and liquid oxygen			2
@entity211 coo @entity221 has said that flights between @entity223 and @entity209 are likely to be available within the next 20 years while the view may not be as expansive as what @entity106 can offer , it will last longer			0
project developers expect the capsule to linger in the middle of the stratosphere for about two hours before returning to the ground			1
the descent should take 25 to 40 minutes			2
a @entity11 ride would cost less than one - third of the $ 250,000 it will cost to fly on @entity106			2
so far , about 650 people have put down deposits or paid for rides on the latter , which is undergoing testing at manufacturer @entity240 ’ facility in @entity137 , @entity138			2
@entity109 aims to begin passenger service next summer , @entity113 said last month			0
@entity109 and others have shown that the luxury market has shifted from high - end goods to high - end experiences , @entity244 co-founder and chief executive @entity243 told @entity250			1
' we found we could put together a business plan that closed in a ticket price that is not too different from other luxury experiences , like a high - end safari and things like that , ' @entity243 said			1
the @entity22 letter describes @entity11 ’s initial launches as taking place from @entity262 ’s @entity261 , a commercial port whose anchor tenant is @entity109			0
@entity30 said the firm is looking at several @entity267 launch sites			0
for added safety and for landing , a steerable parafoil will remain deployed and attached to the capsule throughout the ride , @entity30 and @entity268 said			0
' the balloon you ’re under is the thickness of a dry cleaner bag			0
it ’s very thin material by necessity to get you so high			0
that ’s where the technical risk lies			0
the risks of decompression of the spacecraft or life - support systems failures are really pretty small			0
we ’ve got lots of redundant systems and we can return to lower altitudes pretty quickly , ' @entity243 said			0
' there is a chance – and every once in a while you see in scientific ballooning – of a balloon failure			0
that ’s really what took us to having this para-wing , or parafoil always open so that from just about any altitude the vehicle could safely glide back , ' he added			0
she and her husband earlier this year proposed a private venture to send a married couple to @entity309 in 2018			0
in the early 1990s she and her husband @entity243 , who serves as @entity11 's chief technology officer , spent two years as ' bionauts , ' sealed inside @entity313 , a huge , greenhouse - like structure built in the @entity9 desert .			0

@entity25 announced plans tuesday to send people up in a capsule , lifted 19 miles by a high - altitude balloon
the flight would take 90 minutes to go up at about 1,000 feet a minute , set sail up high for 2 hours
the luxury capsule will allow passengers to walk around and get a drink from the bar
