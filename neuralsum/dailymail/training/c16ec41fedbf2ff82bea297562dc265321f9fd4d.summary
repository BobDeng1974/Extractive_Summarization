the botched execution of an @entity2 inmate that lasted almost 45 minutes was caused by the intravenous line in his groin that swelled to the size of golf ball , according to a state review released on thursday			1
agony : @entity11 's execution was poorly managed according to an @entity2 state official review the line into @entity11 was not properly monitored during his april 29 execution and caused him to writhe and groan in agony and led to governor @entity16 halting all upcoming lethal injections in the state until the completion of the review			1

but the autopsy report performed for the @entity22 said all three execution drugs were found throughout @entity11 's system			1

@entity2 investigators are poised to release a report thursday , september 4 , 2014 into the flawed execution of @entity11 but @entity2 's review did n't find fault with midazolam or other drugs , instead noting that the iv troubles made it difficult to determine the drugs ' effectiveness			1
a paramedic and physician inserted the intravenous line in @entity11 's groin after failing to find suitable veins in his arms , legs , neck and feet			2

' the physician observed an area of swelling underneath the skin and described it as smaller than a tennis ball , but larger than a golf ball			0
the physician believed the swelling would have been noticeable if the access point had been viewed during the process , ' the report said			0
state prisons director @entity29 halted @entity11 's execution , and @entity11 died behind a shuttered curtain 43 minutes after his execution began			1
@entity29 said the cause was a heart attack , but autopsy results released last week said he died from the drugs : midazolam , vercuronium bromide and potassium chloride			0
the autopsy did not explain why the execution took so long or why @entity11 writhed			2
@entity11 's execution was to be the first of two executions held back - to - back on april 29 , but the second execution was postponed that night			1
