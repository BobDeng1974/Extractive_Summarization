just a single cup of coffee a day could help ward off skin cancer , said a study			1
four cups daily , however , would be the most protective against malignant melanoma , said researchers			1
this is the most deadly form of the cancer , which usually starts in a mole and is triggered by short , sharp bursts of sunlight , such as on holiday			1
the volunteers had an average age of 63 at the start of the study when all were free of malignant melanoma			1
by the end , almost 3,000 had been diagnosed with the skin cancer			1
those who drank coffee – 90 per cent of the group – were less likely to have the disease			2
the more they drank , the lower their odds , reported the @entity42			2
those who downed four cups a day were 20 per cent less likely to suffer the illness than those who never drank any			0
previous analysis has shown caffeine can trigger the death of uv - damaged cells but leave healthy ones unharmed			0
the analysis took into account factors that might have affected the result , including smoking , alcohol intake and how sunny a person ’s hometown was			0
increasing problem : the rise of the package holiday is blamed for malignant melanoma now being five times more common than in the 1970s			1
@entity61 , near @entity62 in @entity63 is pictured the researchers said that their finding is preliminary and more research into coffee and , in particular caffeine , ‘ are warranted ’			0
they said that impact of malignant melanoma is so great that even a small reduction in risk could be meaningful			2
however , coffee addicts are n’t completely in the clear			0
the @entity73 advises that drinking more than four cups of coffee a day may increase blood pressure and that lovers of coffee , tea and other caffeine - rich drinks should consider cutting down			0
the rise of the package holiday is blamed for malignant melanoma now being five times more common than in the 1970s , with more 13,000 cases and over 2,000 deaths a year in the @entity87 @entity89 men are particularly at risk - perhaps because they are spending time outside gardening or doing @entity93 shirtless			1
@entity94 , of @entity95 , said : ‘ drinking coffee is n’t a proven way to reduce the risk of developing melanoma , the most serious type of skin cancer , and this study does n’t change that			1
‘ there are lots of drawbacks to this research – it did n’t ask people about how often they went out in strong sun , whether they protected themselves or how likely they were to get sunburn			0
‘ in january the @entity87 sun is n’t strong enough to cause sunburn			0
but if you ’re heading off for some winter sun or going skiing , make sure you protect your skin from strong sun with shade , clothes and sunscreen			2
