a group of @entity2 convicts who tunnelled out of jail to freedom filmed the whole escape on a mobile phone ... before posting the videos online to taunt their hoodwinked guards			1
in a daring breakout that echoed 1994 @entity11 blockbuster @entity12 , 13 prisoners dug a small hole under the wall between their cell and the prison yard in @entity18 , @entity19 , before darting to freedom under cover of darkness			1
but unlike the famous movie , starring @entity25 and @entity26 , which is set in the 1940s , their escape had very modern twist			1
rather than focus purely on getting out of jail without detection , they felt compelled to record the whole experience on a mobile phone and post it on the internet for all to see			2
she said : ' the guard that was there on the day was looking after other things most of the time			0
' we now know that there had not been an inspection of the cell for almost 60 days			0
they were able to dig a tunnel and it was easy to escape after that			2
' @entity69 and @entity70 were two of the crooks that tunnelled out of jail to freedom			0
it is unclear if they appeared in the video more than @entity26 : it was a daring breakout that echoed 1994 @entity11 blockbuster @entity12 , starring @entity26 ( left ) and @entity25 ( right ) - but with a very modern twist the prison guard on duty has been suspended for not managing to foil the secret plot			1
a manhunt has been launched resulting in the capture of two men			0
the other 11 remain at large			0
it is not the first escape from @entity2 jail			2
a year ago 54 prisoners staged a mass escape after a riot at the @entity94 youth detentionfacility in @entity95 , which houses more than 100 detainees			1
dozens of the under - age offenders set fire to their mattresses , sparking a blaze in the prison 's central yard			2
helicopter images showed plumes of smoke rising from the detention centre			0
video footage also showed prisoners climbing over the prison walls and escaping down trees			1
nearly 30 staff members were held hostage during the riot and the facility 's director was admitted to hospital with cuts to his head and bruised ribs .			0
