it came after retired businessman @entity19 and his wife @entity20 , both 58 , admitted they took a drug overdose earlier this week to avoid the prospect of dying in a @entity6 jail			1
the couple had been due to hand themselves to police at 10am on thursday , before being passed to @entity6 authorities			1
but officers rushed to their £ 600,000 home in @entity31 at 7.15am after concerns were raised over their welfare			1
speaking from his hospital bed at @entity35 yesterday , mr @entity19 said : ‘ when we felt there was no hope , the prospect of what lay ahead of us in the @entity6 , we felt that was n’t worth living for			1
’ ' if you look statistically , white collar crime has a 98 per cent chance of going to a plea bargain			0
' if you look at this in the cold light of day we have gone through this rationally so many times in our minds			0
' @entity53 someone is either going to offer us a ridiculously long prison sentence or a plea bargain			0
' we could easily be in the @entity6 for six or eight years			2
' we would return to the @entity13 in our mid-sixties , with no money , no jobs and no home			0
' frankly that was a prospect we did n’t feel like enduring eight years of hell for			0
' last month the couple lost a @entity65 battle last month against extradition to @entity67 to stand trial over fraud charges relating to mr @entity19 's company , @entity71			1

they insist these were ‘ wholly legitimate ’ business expenses			0

' on wednesday evening , we were really just hanging on , ' he said			0
' that evening we got an email from mp @entity114 saying @entity118 had cancelled her meeting with her			0
treatment : the @entity91 both spent the night at @entity122 and are expected to be taken to @entity124 court when they are discharged ' @entity114 has worked tirelessly for us - but the people that should care just do n’t seem to want to be involved			0
' we rationally weighted up all the options and saw no other choice			2
' we faced a three year wait for a trial in the @entity6 and we were already told we were going to be held in a high security super max prison with a pretty harsh regime and it would n’t have the medical facilities for my health			2
' we were facing the prospect of enduring eight years of hell , and are still facing the same dilemma			0
denial : the couple , who have five grandchildren , ' vehemently reject ' allegations relating to expenses claims by mr @entity19 while he was working in the @entity6 ' it ’s a bit like when someone has a terminal illness , they will sometimes end their lives with the happy memories they once had rather than face the terminal illness			1
' what we did was n’t a publicity stunt , we fully expected not to be here today and we have to be grateful for the police and hospital staff for how they have looked after us over the last 24 hours			2
' now we are having to go to separate counselling meetings where we are really saying " what ’s next ? " ' nothing ’s really changed , the extradition warrant still exists and that has n’t changed at all			0
' a journalist from a local newspaper had arrived at the couple 's £ 500,000 detached home to speak to them but police were alerted when there was no response from the pair			1

' mr @entity19 added that his wife has been taken off a drip and is feeling ' very shaken ' and is ' struggling to sit up			2
