it has never been easy to fathom the inner workings of @entity3 ’s mind , yet it has rarely been harder , or more pertinent , to do so than here in the dry heat of the desert			1
there was a growing consensus among us amateur paddock psychologists that almost the only man who can beat @entity3 in the title - deciding @entity12 is @entity3 himself			1
of course , @entity14 , his @entity15 team - mate , must play his part			1
he must finish fifth to stand any chance at all of closing the 17 - point gap to @entity3			1
even if @entity14 were to win , second would be enough for @entity3 to take the title			1
if @entity14 were second , @entity3 would need to be fifth etc , etc. @entity3 faces the @entity22 equivalent of defending a 1 - 0 lead in football for 90 minutes on sunday the @entity15 driver can become the first @entity27 double world champion since @entity28 in 1971 @entity3 during practice ahead of the @entity12 on sunday against @entity30 the permutations are extensive , and that is at the root of the fear some of us feel for the @entity27 driver as he goes into the biggest weekend of his life — since the last one			1
that was in 2008 , when he fought a tactical race and emerged victorious , a touch fortuitously by passing @entity42 on the last lap to finish fifth and clinch the title			2
again , his task is less clear than that of his opponent — @entity48 six years ago and @entity14 here			2
@entity3 is facing @entity22 ’s equivalent of defending a 1 - 0 lead in football for 90 minutes , the approximate duration of sunday ’s race that starts at dusk and finishes in the dark			1
@entity3 is a super-accomplished driver , of course , but part of his brilliance is binary : everything or nothing , win at all costs , high - risk overtaking without a care in the world			1
the dynamics of sunday mean the psychological advantage has shifted quite markedly			2
@entity14 , the impressive winner of the last race in @entity69 , realised this sooner than anyone and arrived in his press briefing , his shoulders back and his head up , talking about piling pressure on @entity76			1
that strain is all the greater for the @entity78 because of the extraordinary expectations he and the watching public bestowed upon him when he arrived in @entity22 as a rookie of dazzling gifts			0
if he should flunk it on sunday — or his @entity15 car betrays him — the script he wrote for himself would be ripped up			1
@entity15 driver @entity3 ( pictured ) is agonisingly close to sealing the title over team - mate and rival @entity14 @entity3 ( pictured ) and @entity14 have been instructed by @entity88 , the head of @entity15 , to simply race if he wins he will become the first @entity27 double world champion since @entity28 in 1971 , and who is to say what more records may not fall to him			1
the dichotomy between success and failure is chilling			0
it is said that this is @entity14 ’s only chance of the title his father , @entity101 , won in 1982			1
that is not necessarily so , but , still , being so close to a lifetime ’s dream carries a burden that must , however fleetingly , interrupt his customarily long hours of sleep			0
the task of managing the two protagonists has fallen to @entity88 , the head of @entity15			1
he will not issue his men with any team orders			2
they will be free to race			0
@entity88 was relaxed in the paddock of this £ 800million confection of @entity114 , but his insight was illuminating			2
‘ neither is an easy individual , ’ he said , approvingly			0
‘ they are both complex characters			0
’ i suggested that @entity14 , despite the polished demeanour of a blue - chip company ’s dream , has a bit of menace in him			2
‘ ruthless , ruthless , ’ said @entity88			2
‘ that boy , @entity124 , knows what he wants			0
sometimes you say you need a difficult upbringing in order to be competitive			2
he had it all : son of a world champion , raised in @entity132 , went to the international school			1
you ca n’t imagine a better family environment than that , and still , against the odds , he is an extremely competitive person			2
’ @entity14 has been labelled ' ruthless ' and ' an extremely competitive person ' by @entity88 , the head of @entity15 @entity88 on @entity3 's title competitor @entity14 : ‘ ruthless , ruthless			1
that boy , @entity124 , knows what he wants ' @entity14 will look to be breathing down @entity3 's neck during the @entity12 on sunday and @entity3 ? ‘ i have been almost blown away by @entity3 ’s development in the last year - and - a - half , as a personality			1
he came from this @entity146 environment which had two sides to it			0
‘ on one side he had a very long relationship with a father figure in @entity152 , being raised in the team , and owing it all to them			2
and on the other side he felt he needed to emancipate himself			0
‘ he came to us and it was all new			0
over the course of time , his trust in the team grew , relationships started to be established			0
‘ he has a solid private life			0
for a couple of months he has been almost invulnerable			0
not unbeatable on track , but as a person			0
he has a bad session and , because he wears his heart on his sleeve , he ’s down			0
but you see him half an hour later and he is back			0
he was n’t like this before			0
’ there is a persuasive argument that @entity3 , who was so marginally quicker than @entity14 in practice on friday that it was hardly material , deserves the title more than his rival because he has won the majority of races — 10 wins to five so far — and is the purer racer			1
but if @entity14 holds his nerve and @entity3 wobbles in the final character examination here on sunday who could begrudge him the title ? two final thoughts			1
first , let ’s hope — putting sporting fairness ahead of patriotism — that the arbitrary double scoring that has been introduced for this race does not distort the championship			0
secondly , what chance a @entity194 having an impact on the title ? the @entity198 was a hopeless backmarker who took out @entity201 at @entity202 in 1988 , spoiling @entity146 ’s 100 per cent winning record			0
@entity152 said @entity194 ruined his life			0
so @entity3 , our @entity27 hope , beware slow - moving vehicles , do n’t be frozen by tactical cul - de sacs , be blessed with technical reliability , and the title will be yours			1
if @entity3 wobbles and @entity14 holds his nerve , then the title could go to the latter instead of the @entity215 @entity3 goes into sunday 's @entity12 looking to seal the all - important title over @entity14			1

@entity3 goes into title - deciding @entity12 on sunday
but team - mate and title rival @entity14 will be breathing down his neck
if @entity15 driver @entity3 wins he will become the first @entity27 double world champion since @entity28 in 1971
@entity88 , head of @entity15 , labels @entity14 ' ruthless ' and ' competitive '
