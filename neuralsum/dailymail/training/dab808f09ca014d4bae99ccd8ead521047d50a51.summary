@entity9 , 28 , filmed his daughter @entity10 taking the family @entity12 for a spin and uploaded the shocking footage online			1
he urged the schoolgirl to keep speeding up , even though the car appeared to be drifted into the @entity17			2
scroll down to watch the shocking video @entity19 : eight - year - old @entity10 driving her father 's @entity12 on a rural snow - covered road investigation : the girl 's parents @entity9 , left , and @entity26 , right , are the subjects of a police probe while most @entity3 web users were highly critical of @entity9 's behaviour , others praised him and said that they too had been taught to drive from a very early age			1
the video shows the father sitting next to @entity10 , telling her : ' come on , speed up			1
' is it at least 70kph ? do n't look at the speedometer , look at the road			2
' then he hands the camera to his 29 - year - old wife , who is sitting in the back , saying : ' there you go @entity26 , have a look			0
' danger : @entity10 looks nervous as her father tells her to carry on accelerating despite her high speed quick : the eight - year - old ended up going as fast as 100kph , which is more than 60mph as the speed increases , with the father occasionally clutching the wheel to control the car , he tells his daughter : ' push it to at least 100kph			1
' as she tops 90kph ( 56mph ) , he tells her insistently : ' come on , you stop looking at the speed , just press the gas , do n't be scared			0
' the couple from @entity63 are facing a police probe over the hair raising drive			0
' an investigation has been opened , ' said a spokesman			0
neither the eight - year - old driver nor her parents were wearing seatbelts during the drive lasting more than six minutes			0
@entity10 appears nervous at times but finally exclaims after reaching 100kph : ' a child who is only eight years old and already she can drive a car			1
' reckless : neither @entity10 not her parents appeared to be wearing a seatbelt during the journey help : @entity9 sometimes put his hand on the wheel to stop the car weaving across the road comments from @entity3 who watched the video included ' brainless ' , ' complete idiots ' and , ' the poor child is not guilty , it is all her parents ' fault			1
' one site branded @entity9 ' the worst father in the world for this grotesque child abuse '			2
another said : ' how can any parents do this ? they should be deprived of their rights to raise the child			0
' but others praised the parents for allowing their child to drive			0
success : @entity10 appeared unharmed after driving the car and boasted of her motoring prowess ' you do n't need a lot of experience to hold the steering wheel and press the gas , so there is nothing particularly wrong with that , ' @entity105 wrote			1
' i also learned to drive at about the same age on a deserted highway , though my parents did n't allow me to go more than 80 kph			0
' someone else posted : ' i 'm glad that there are still people in this country who teach children how to make the right choice			0
my dad taught me to drive a car when i was seven years old			2
' it is unclear what punishment the parents might face , but some have suggested it could be a fine as low as 2,500 roubles ( Â£ 55 ) for allowing their daughter to drive without a licence .			2
