a filmmaker and scientists believe a ' huge ' super shark could have eaten a three - metre great white shark that was being tracked in a satellite program			1
the tracking tag washed up on a @entity7 beach with signs it had been bleached by stomach acid and its data showed rapid changes in depth and a rise in temperature reflecting the animal that ate it			1
filmmaker @entity18 was part of the crew documenting the @entity22 's white shark satellite tagging program in 2004 when the three - metre animal was identified about four months before the tag washed up in the @entity26			1
the tag showed an abrupt 580 - metre - deep fall down a continental shelf and huge temperature rise , indicating the shark had become prey to a much larger creature			1
' the data contained on the shark showed at least the tag had been ingested with an animal with the internal temperature of 26 degrees , ' mr @entity18 said			1
after talking to sperm whale hunters in the @entity26 , mr @entity18 learnt of sightings off of an animal about 10 - and - a - half metres long and others that were tracked travelling at up to 4.5 knots but did not surface			2
the graph shows the change in depth as the animal moved down a continental shelf off the @entity7 coast filmmaker @entity57 has been trying to solve the mystery of what killed the shark through crowd funding , mr @entity18 has been completing expeditions to an area 60 kilometres off the @entity26 coast where the shark was tagged			1
he has invited scientists to go with him and said none had discounted his theories			0
mr @entity18 believes it is most likely that the shark was eaten by another large shark of the mackerel species			2
' but by the same token , i 'm not 100 per cent convinced , ' he added			0
' looking at the profile of the animal that ate it , 26 degrees , that 's pretty high but not enough to be a mammal but it 's something seriously huge to sustain that temperature - the larger the animal , the more capable it is of an elevated temperature , ' he said			2
mr @entity18 added that based on the tag data , the animal that ate the device had a stomach area at least one - metre wide			1
mr @entity18 believes another massive shark could have eaten the three - metre animal there have been reports of a 10 - and - a - half metre animal in waters near where the shark vanished ' the notion of gigantismis well documented in species , to me that plausible , ' he said			1
but mr @entity18 said he was not alluding to some mythical creature			0
' i 'm not going down to notion of a prehistoric beast roaming out there , ' he said			0
' this is nature at work and we are just trying to get to the bottom of something that happened years ago			0
' ' i do n't know that we will ever know what happened to that animal , but if the reports are true ( from the whalers ) we may get a glimpse at what they saw			0
' with the mystery sparking mr @entity18 ' interest , he sought production funding with his project partners to create the search for the @entity121 's @entity120 for the @entity122 , which has recently been re-cut for the @entity124 audiences			0
the shark disappeared about 60 kilometres off @entity26 on the @entity7 coast for about eight years mr @entity18 observed the area , 60 kilometres off @entity26 , @entity7 , where the shark was believed to have been taken			1
the filmmaker observed large numbers of killer whales and also a deep sea hydro carbon system leak in the same area			0
he also noticed a large aggregation of animals , including sperm whales , pilot whales , blue fin tuna , oceanic sun fish and other species of shark in the area during summer			0
' i started joining the dots - it appears to me likely that the incident has something to do with this multi-spieces aggregation , ' he said			0
but mr @entity18 questioned the likelihood of the shark being eaten by a killer whale , because the mammal has a similar temperature to a human and too high for that recorded by the tag			2
but the filmmaker did develop a theory that the impact of the hydro carbon leak and that it was fertilising the ocean canyon where the shark went missing			2
' there 's something happening out there that 's causing the aggregation of life - there are 36 underwater canyons between @entity7 and @entity170 but this is the only one located with this intensity of life , ' he said			2
he hopes to be able to complete a sequel to the original documentary in the future			0
the great white shark is found on all of @entity7 's coastline and can range between three - and - a - half to five metres long and weigh on average 1,300 kilograms			1

a three - metre great white shark was tagged off the @entity7 coast
four months later , the tag washed up with signs it had been eaten
data on the tag showed changes in temperature and depth
a filmmaker has tried to solve the mystery and believes another ' huge ' shark was *responsible* for eating it
