by @entity1 reporter published : 21:39 est , 23 august 2012 updated : 22:01 est , 25 august 2012 a heartbroken father whose daughter was diagnosed with schizophrenia after trying to jump out of a second - story window at age six has described his despair in a new book			1
in his memoirs ' january @entity10 , ' @entity9 chronicles his family 's experience with the devastating mental illness , which usually presents itself at least a decade later - between the ages of 18 and 22			1
the @entity17 , @entity18 , man and his wife , @entity19 , were forced to hospitalise their daughter , january , on multiple occasions , fearing for their and their baby son @entity24 's lives			1
heartbreak : @entity9 , right , has chronicled his family 's experience in a book titled ' january first ' the girl , who is now 10 , was formally diagnosed after she tried to choke herself and jump out of her second - story bedroom window			1
@entity9 knew something was wrong when @entity33 , as they call her , was just a baby , as she rarely slept and the parents had to visually stimulate her at all times to stop her screaming			1
but @entity33 's behaviour became increasingly disturbing as she grew older , with her even trying to harm herself and her newborn brother			1
' one minute she 'd be sweet and loving and then it was like a switch was flipped , and she was trying to attack @entity42 , or @entity19 , or me , ' @entity9 told @entity44			1
family : @entity9 , right , and wife , @entity19 , left , were forced to hospitalise january , centre , on multiple occasions , fearing for their and their baby son @entity24 's lives sick : january , pictured , was formally diagnosed after she tried to choke herself and jump out of her second - story bedroom window ' and then , as fast as it came , it would turn off again			1
she would act like nothing happened – there was no pouting , and there were times she was fine with @entity62			0
' @entity33 , who was also incredibly bright , with an iq of 146 , would n't interact with kids her own age			1
she instead lived between reality and an imaginary island she called @entity71 , where her ' friends ' included animals and people she named after numbers			0
book : the memoirs , pictured , describes january 's decent into madness and her father 's struggle to save her the family visited scores of doctors who failed to diagose her , instead throwing around conditions such as autism or bipolar			1
she was prescribed several medications but nothing calmed her			0
it was n't until she was in @entity94 that dr @entity95 , clinical professor and director of inpatient child and adolescent psychiatric services at @entity98 , gave @entity33 's illness a name			1
' she was not unique , but for a child that age to have such floored psychotic symptoms with visual and auditory hallucinations – you do n’t normally see that in a six - year - old , ' he told @entity44			0
' we do have children that age in the hospital , but not for those reasons			0
' @entity9 said he had a mixed reaction to finally hearing his daughter 's diagnosis			1
' there was a brief second of happiness – finally we have a name to it – and then the reality of what it meant hit me , ' he said			0
' her life expectancy is shorter , and i might outlive her – and i could n’t deal with that			0
' now 10 years old , @entity33 is on a cocktail of clozapine , @entity128 and lithium , and attends almost daily therapy sessions to keep her symptoms at bay , although her hallucinations and the voices she hears will never completely disappear			1
' we ’ve helped educate her as to when her experiences are psychotic symptoms , how she can get her needs met , and getting her to work better with her peers , ' @entity9 told @entity44			2
dangerous : @entity33 's behaviour became increasingly disturbing as she grew older , with her even trying to harm her newborn brother , @entity24 , right close : january 's parents took her to scores of doctors before the disturbed young girl was correctly diagnosed as schizophrenic ' i do n’t remember who i was before all of this , and there ’s no going back			1
but , there are a lot of kids out there like @entity33 and no support system			2
' according to the @entity163 , schizophrenia affects about 1 per cent of @entity164 and is thought to be hereditary			2
it ’s a chronic , severe and disabling brain disorder that causes people to hear voices and have hallucinations , believe other people are reading their minds , controlling their thoughts or plotting to harm them			0
but the illness is usually diagnosed in the late teens or early 20s			2
' it ’s unusual to see it present itself below 12 years of age , ' @entity95 said			0
childhood schizophrenia , also known as childhood - onset schizophrenia or early - onset schizophrenia is basically the same as schizophrenia in adults , but it sets in earlier in life			2
the condition is rare in children and difficult to recognise during its early phases			0
early - onset schizophrenia starts when the child is aged between 13 and 18 years , although very early - onset schizophrenia starts when the child is aged 12 years or less , as in january 's case			1
the psychiatric illness can have a massive impact on the child 's ability to function properly			2
a child with schizophrenia may have hallucinations , delusions , irrational thinking , bizarre behavior and difficulties performing everyday tasks , such as washing			2
he or she may have gradual changes in behavior , for example a child who once enjoyed relationships with others may begin to become withdrawn and shy , and appear to be in a world of their own			0
the child may start talking about unusual ideas and fears			0
they may become clingy with their parents and say things that do not make any sense			2
experts are not sure what the causes of schizophrenia are			0
recent studies suggest a combination of factors , including brain changes , as well as biochemical , environmental and genetic factors may play a part			0
schizophrenia can not be cured with modern medicine and therapies			0
however , it can be controlled .			0
