by @entity0 @entity1 is now on @entity2			1
under the guise of its @entity6 website , the official website of the terror organization , the terror group has now fired up its own @entity2 feed , possibly in response to the effectiveness of terrorists live - tweeting the @entity13 mall attack			1
having already issued 29 tweets ranging in topics from death tallies to religious proclamations , @ shomokhalislam has almost 1,800 followers as of early saturday morning			2
the account ’s opening signals a shift in the terror organization ’s outreach , propaganda and basic communications efforts , according to experts			1
terrifying : @entity1 has started its own @entity2 account ‘ we ’ve seen terrorist groups make increasingly effective use of social media , particularly @entity2 and @entity35 , in recent years , ’ @entity29 , a counterterrorism expert , told the @entity30			2
‘ not only is this important for propaganda purposes but also recruitment			0
’ the @entity2 account is not locked or kept private , and its followers appear mostly to be journalists and curious gawkers			1
the website is closed to the public			0
some of the postings , translated to @entity45 , are accounts of operations			0
others are religious decrees and links to statements on the @entity6 website and @entity54 videos			0
' @entity55 , the @entity56 today are going through a period of great scrutiny and trial be them good @entity60 , and certain after @entity61 , ’ read one tweet			0
potential recruiting tool : new recruits belonging to @entity67 's @entity1 - linked @entity66 rebel group march during a passing out parade ' @entity70 from @entity71 burn under the feet of the servants of worshipers of the cross , the explosive device was detonated now targeting bus least the staff of the @entity78 of @entity79 in @entity70 , ' read another , before giving a death toll of 17 , with 35 injured in the attack			1
' the attack killed more than 17 people dead and inflicted 35 wounded in the initial toll expected to rise			2
. source brother @entity86 , ' said the most recent tweet sent from the account			0
though likely subject to intense intelligence community scrutiny , the account may seek to spread a more general message			0
despite well - known power struggles among different @entity1 factions , the @entity2 account 's administrator has pledged to remain neutral and focus on spreading the terror group 's message , according to the @entity30			1
spreading the word : an @entity99 shows his @entity101 machine gun with arabic language professing allegiance to ' @entity1 ' organization ' we ’ve also seen divisions within these groups played out in social media , the most obvious example being the criticism on @entity2 and @entity54 directed at @entity66 leaders by former member @entity114 jihadi @entity113 , who had helped them develop their social media presence , ' said mr @entity29 @entity2 has yet to suspend the account as it did multiple @entity66 accounts during the @entity13 mall attack			1
by allowing the feed to remain up , argues another expert , @entity2 is allowing @entity1 to further decentralize its powerbase and further streamline its communications			2
' if the dissemination of official releases is no longer to be done centrally , it has the potential to make the forums obsolete and usher in a new era whereby jihadi activists primarily rely on social media platforms to interact with one another , ' @entity125 , a counterterrorism analyst , told the @entity30 .			0

the *launch* comes only days after the @entity13 mall attack was live tweeted by @entity1 *affiliate* @entity66
followers are mostly journalists and curious *onlookers*
analysts feel it is a shift in strategy for the terror group
