it does not get any worse than this			0
this was one of the worst days in the history of @entity7 one - day cricket			2
it is impossible to exaggerate the size and multitude of @entity12 ’s defeat at the hands of @entity14 here			1
if @entity12 ’s humiliation at the hands of @entity18 last week was bad then this was much , much worse			1
within seven days they have been systematically dismantled by not one but two @entity22 hosts playing a completely different game			1
and however good the @entity24 and @entity25 have been that is unacceptable			0
it is hard to remember a more one - sided game than this			0
hard to remember when @entity12 were so totally out - classed by any side in any format , even @entity18 at their absolute peak			2
but can anything have been as bad as this for @entity12 ? ever ? the grim statistics tell you all you need to know – @entity12 were brushed aside for 123 in 33.2 overs having been 102 for three after 25 and then overtaken by @entity14 in just 12.2 overs			1
if it were not so embarrassing it would be laughable and it is hard to see how @entity12 can recover from this			2
they play @entity64 in @entity65 on monday and can afford no further slip - ups if they are to reach the quarter - finals , let alone compete in this @entity22			2
and the damage done to some of the @entity12 players , not to mention the regime who have been trying to pick up the broken pieces of @entity7 cricket for over a year since the @entity75 , could be irreparable			1
@entity12 were always going to struggle against @entity18 and @entity14 in their opening two games			1
it would be unrealistic to think anything otherwise with a team playing catch - up in the demands of modern one - day cricket			2
but to lose so emphatically , so gruesomely and without any glimmers of encouragement was almost cruel			0
more than cruel , it was obscene			0
and it left @entity7 cricket squirming in disbelief			0
credit where it is due			0
@entity14 were magnificent here in their capital city and @entity40 produced a truly great spell of fast bowling to rip the heart out of the feeble @entity7 batting			1
it was close to the perfect performance			0
this is not the @entity14 we have become accustomed to in recent years			2
they are no longer the dark horses or the gallant , but not quite top class , triers			0
they are one of the best , most aggressive and potent teams in this tournament			0
@entity12 's captain @entity36 walks off the ground with his team - mates after losing to @entity14 @entity108 gets to his feet after diving to make his ground as the only @entity12 player to emerge with any credit in @entity38 they have the best , most aggressive and most imaginative captain in world cricket and an awesome presence at the top of the order , as he showed with a spectacular display of hitting when he had @entity12 on the floor			1
this was a special day for @entity14 cricket and their hugely impressive captain who thrashed @entity12 for 77 in just 25 balls with seven sixes and eight fours			1
he hit 77 off 25 balls whereas the best @entity12 could muster was @entity108 ’s 46 as everything fell apart around him			1
but no @entity12 side should be beaten as comprehensively as this			2
not by any side in the world game			0
not with all their money and resources , all the expertise at their disposal and all the tradition and history of their cricket			0
we had to sit through last year ’s ashes for heaven ’s sake so that the calendar could be changed and @entity12 could have an unprecedented run of one - day cricket to try to make sure they were as thoroughly prepared as possible to compete in this @entity22			1
please do not laugh when you read that			0
@entity36 is lost for words in the field			0
@entity157 went for 24.50 - an - over during his time with the ball @entity160 @entity108 was yet again the only batsman to show any sort of application @entity163 did n't know where to turn as he was being carted to all corners of the ground @entity167 checks his bat after a dismal display out in the middle for @entity12 @entity14 captain @entity38 later hit the @entity22 's fastest half - century in history how pathetic that seems now			1
not unless @entity12 can somehow rise from the canvas and begin their @entity22 all over again now the spectre of facing up to the big two has been taken away from them			1
for now they have much , much to contemplate			0
they had no answer to the brilliance of @entity40 after @entity36 had gone against his instincts and decided to bat first even though the ball was swinging round corners in practice			2
four of @entity40 ’s seven wickets were clean bowled , at least two of them in @entity44 and @entity187 dismissed by absolute beauties , and when he had finished he had the best one - day international figures in @entity14 history and the third best of any side in any @entity22			1
the game was over then as a contest but the humiliation was only just starting			0
for @entity38 absolutely murdered them with an eye on @entity14 ’s run - rate , showing no mercy to his close friend @entity36 and inflicting every ounce of damage possible on @entity157 in particular who went for 49 off two overs			1
@entity38 powered his way to a stunning 77 off just 25 balls in a blistering 40 - minute spell opener @entity205 congratulates @entity38 after he reached his half - century in double - quick time @entity207 took a stunning catch to dismiss captain @entity36 after a stuttering display @entity211 was given a lesson by @entity38 in his first over it was all over by 6.30pm even though , absurdly , the match had to stop for supper when @entity14 needed just 12 runs for victory			1
at least those spectators in the 30,000 sell - out crowd at this rugby stadium who had decided to come to the match after work had a little more cricket to see			0
@entity14 will take some beating in this tournament but that is no consolation for @entity12			1
they head south to @entity65 with their reputations on the line and with @entity231 having to show more than ever in his troubled two spells as @entity12 coach that he belongs at this level			2
a game against @entity64 , with @entity12 ’s @entity236 winning captain in @entity238 in their ranks , suddenly becomes the most important game in the lives of this @entity12 side and their coaches			1
they can not afford to fail now .			0

@entity12 were bowled out for just 123 batting first in @entity246
only the gallant @entity108 scored more than 20 runs
@entity40 ripped through @entity12 , taking seven wickets
@entity14 captain @entity38 then *smashed* 77 off 25 balls
it was the fastest fifty ever seen in @entity22 cricket
