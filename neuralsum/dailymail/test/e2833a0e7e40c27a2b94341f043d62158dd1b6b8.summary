@entity2 's ' @entity1 ' video has been given an 18 rating by a @entity5 television network - because it features two men holding hands			1
@entity8 , an independent network , fears the video launching @entity13 's @entity12 bid may fall foul of @entity17 's ' gay propaganda ' laws - which allows the imposition heavy fines for promoting homosexuality to people under the age of 18			1
@entity13 's video not only features @entity25 campaigners @entity26 and @entity27 , from @entity28 , @entity29 , holding hands , but talking about their up - coming wedding			1
restricted : a @entity5 television network has given @entity2 's video an 18 rating because it features a gay couple , who are planning a summer wedding , holding hands equality : @entity26 ( pictured right ) and his fiancé @entity27 , were delighted to be included in the video , saying it showed off the changing attitudes of the @entity45 @entity26 's voice is heard in a voiceover saying : ' i ’m getting married this summer to someone i really care about			1
' the inclusion of the segment has won widespread support , and highlights @entity13 's own stand on equality			0
@entity26 himself has said he was overjoyed to be part of the @entity13 roll out - and part of a large - scale change in @entity45 social attitudes			2
' it shows how far we 've come , ' said @entity26 , a 31 - year - old lawyer and social activist , pleased that public support for same - sex marriage rights has grown so far as to appear in a presidential campaign launch			2
but it is at odds with @entity5 's view on lgbt rights , which have become increasingly restrictive during @entity17 's presidency			0
however , @entity71 , an opposition network , told @entity73 it had acted before being instructed by the @entity5 government			1
if they had aired it without the warning , the company could have faced a fine of as much as £ 13,200 under 2013 's gay propaganda laws			1
@entity71 is not the only company to take preemptive action like this : in march , @entity82 pulled its online magazine @entity83 , which ' demonstrates various aspects of home life regardless of age , gender , sexual orientation '			0
the @entity90 retailer decided to remove it as there was a risk ' some material in our magazine can be considered as propaganda '			0
backwards : but while the @entity45 may be becoming more inclusive , @entity5 has recently been putting in place more repressive laws as the government becomes increasingly anti lgbt rights fine : opposition television network @entity71 decided to give it the rating to avoid getting a £ 13,200 fine differing views : @entity17 ( left ) and @entity13 ( right ) are on other sides of the divide when it comes to lgbt rights - with the former first lady being a staunch supporter of equality but it is not just the @entity45 and @entity5 as countries which are at odds with each other : @entity17 and @entity13 hold very differing views personally as well			1
speaking in 2014 , @entity17 claimed there was a need to ' clean up ' homosexuality in @entity5 order to drive up the country 's birth rate , and defended the country 's right to pass such a law			2
the @entity5 leader - who claims he has gay friends - has gone as far as to link gay people to pedophiles in the past			2
meanwhile , the same year @entity17 signed the gay propaganda law into being , secretary of state @entity13 had publicly come out in support of gay marriage			1
' @entity137 are our colleagues , our teachers , our soldiers , our friends , our loved ones , and they are full and equal citizens and deserve the rights of citizenship - that includes marriage , ' she said in the video			0
' i support it personally and as a matter of policy and law			0
' like so many others , my personal views have been shaped over time by people i have known and loved , by my experience representing our nation on the world 's stage , my devotion to law and human rights , and the guiding principles of my faith			0
' @entity13 also has a lot of support within the @entity168 community , with the nation 's largest lesbian political action committee launching @entity171 to support her bid for the @entity12			0
@entity174 , co-chaired by pioneering tennis great @entity175 , said : ' @entity2 is a proven leader and she has a strong track record when it comes to inclusion -- specifically for women and the lgbtq community			0
