places to watch out for digital pickpockets include crowded shopping centres and busy stations where transactions are constantly being made special wallets that use foil can block these radio frequency signals , but the threat remains very real			2
@entity162 is attempting to overcome the problem by not storing any numbers on an @entity165			0

criminals use @entity13 and @entity110 wireless communication to steal numbers
the readers can be brought online or downloaded to phone via an app
they have to stand six inches away while a transaction is being made
within a matter of seconds , the technology can pick up and store data
a $ 300 machine can then replicate the card so it can be used elsewhere
it is *estimated* 70 *%* cards will soon be vulnerable to digital pick pocketing
cards can be protected from @entity13 skimmers by being wrapped in tin foil
