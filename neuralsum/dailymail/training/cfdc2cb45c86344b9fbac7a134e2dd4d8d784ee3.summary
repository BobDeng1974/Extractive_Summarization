for a short while , there was a rumour that @entity3 could recover from a broken back in time to feature again in this @entity5			1
there was a treatment , it was said			0
if you were going to break your back , it was reasoned , the @entity15 vertebrae was the way to go			0
one possible procedure involved isolating the area to return full feeling to @entity3 ’s extremities , followed by a series of painkilling needles			1
why bother with that detail , it was argued , if he was n’t going to play again ? suddenly , coming back five weeks early from a stated six - week absence was a credible option			2
the national characteristic of @entity35 is hope			1
so even now , following a mystified official statement by the national federation denying @entity3 ’s return , it remains			1
they will continue to pray for the miracle , obviously , for this is a religious and superstitious country , too			2
yet if hope can be said to have a plan a it is that , without @entity3 , some of the more mediocre talents within the selecao sprout wings and fly in @entity77 on tuesday evening against @entity78			1
@entity42 had a good game against @entity80 on the opening day ; @entity82 has potential if given the opportunity ; maybe hulk through the middle			1
seeing red : @entity82 , one of the favourites to replace @entity3 in the starting @entity87 , jogs with a red bib must go on : @entity89 ( left ) in training at @entity91 without @entity3 leading man : if there is one who represents @entity35 ¿ s undying hope , it is @entity97 ( right ) alas , poor @entity97			1
if there is a footballer who embodies @entity35 ’s default state of optimism it is @entity97 and the faith @entity89 , the coach , has in his striker			1
to the rest of the world , @entity97 has been as effective at this @entity5 as a professional ice - sculpting business in @entity108 , but @entity89 believes and the nation must , too			1
watching @entity35 ’s match with @entity114 last week , @entity115 , whose career at @entity112 belies the fact he also made 50 appearances at @entity118 for his country , was almost apoplectic at @entity97 ’s inertia			1
yet this week , @entity122 tabloid @entity121 — @entity123 , named for being a very light read — depicted the striker on its front page as @entity127 , flying to the rescue of his team in their @entity5 semi-final			2
they may have been joking			0
@entity133 is the pet name given to the country ’s federal capital , @entity137			0
it translates as ‘ capital of hope ’			0
it was built under the orders of former president @entity143 as part of his @entity145 , which translates as ‘ plan of goals ’			0
@entity149 ready to fill @entity3 's boots flexible : @entity152 and @entity41 start a complicated series of stretches in training ahead of the @entity78 game your turn : the defensive pair switch roles as @entity41 helps @entity160 stretch his left leg nice footwork : the pair look as if they are dancing rather than preparing for a @entity5 semi-final his slogan was ‘ 50 years ’ prosperity in five ’ , an optimistic leap even by the standards of political rhetoric			1
and that sums up @entity35			2
it is a country in which better times are always around the corner , in which the population remains largely happy and optimistic despite a murder rate more conducive with civil war			0
between 1980 and 2011 , 1.1million people were murdered in @entity35			2
in 2012 alone , 47,136 were intentionally killed , although that figure is probably between 10 and 25 per cent higher , due to the number of deaths listed as unexplained in the poorest regions			0
roads are treacherous and journeys carry an underlying risk of tragedy , with roughly 35,000 dying on the roads each year ( compared to under 2,000 in the @entity190 )			0
@entity143 ’s @entity145 included much highway construction , at the expense of rail transportation , but many of these roads are no longer adequately maintained and have dangerous potholes and other hazards			0
@entity143 himself died in a car accident in 1976 and it is hard to find a @entity28 life that does not contain at least one similar tragedy			2
a nephew of @entity35 coach @entity89 died in a car accident on the eve of the tournament			2
@entity207 lost two sons , and his mother - in - law , all in separate road collisions			0
man in charge : @entity89 orders his men around in training in @entity215 on monday optimism rises : in such volatile environment , what else remains but hope in @entity35 ? highs and lows : @entity35 fans will either be celebrating wildly or heartbroken by tuesday evening a son of @entity223 was sentenced to prison for causing the death of a motorcyclist in @entity227 in 1999 , although the decision was later overturned			1
@entity3 was fortunate to survive a serious car accident at the age of four months			2
in this volatile environment , what else remains but hope ? @entity235 tourists now revel in the authenticity of pacified favelas and while the team is still in the @entity5 this remains a pacified @entity35			1
the locals take the same optimism into their football that they display in their daily lives			0
mostly , it will be ok			0
mostly , we will be the lucky ones			0
and , if we are , then the sun is shining and the view might be beautiful , and life is good , and our team wins			0
it ’s the @entity28 way			1
so while @entity3 is still mourned - and his team - mates sent a tribute to him by mimicking his ' @entity46 ' celebration and posting it on @entity255 - on tuesday @entity28 will gather again in an almost evangelical state of expectation			1
this is also a country in which otherwise rational citizens place their hands on the screens of televisions sets and cry ‘ @entity263 ’ during penalty shootouts			0
their players ’ response to the national anthem is cathartic , religious in its intensity			0
eyes tight shut , or weeping , they sing , long after the music has stopped			0
repeat performance ? @entity89 is on the verge of leading @entity276 to a second world up triumph heart : @entity89 was willing to give @entity42 ( background ) time off after becoming a father @entity89 , an emotional , devout man who embarked on a pilgrimage to @entity283 of @entity284 near the city of @entity286 to give thanks for the @entity5 win of 2002 , is the perfect choice to lead such a group			1
at times , he is as emotionally overwrought as the country he leads in this tournament			0
asked , gently , about the motivation of @entity3 ’s absence on monday , he gave a reply dripping with drama			1
' @entity3 has left a lot of himself with us , and he will have taken a lot of us with him , ' he said			2
' he has done his share , now it is time for us to so our share – myself , @entity40 , the players , all the @entity28 people			1
' there is , for obvious reasons , some wonderful writing on football in @entity35 — the true name of the @entity310 is @entity314 @entity313 , after the sports journalist and writer who campaigned most tirelessly for it to be built — yet the country has preferred to deal with @entity3 ’s injury by emoting rather than analysing			1
one - man team ? @entity115 , who played 50 times for @entity35 , believes the side are @entity3 - dependent there has been very little criticism , for instance , of @entity89 ’s brutal approach to @entity327 and the more creative players in the @entity114 team that may have inspired @entity331 ’s fateful payback assault on @entity35 ’s greatest player			1
so , how weakened are @entity35 by his absence ? statistics suggest , not as much as people think			2
since 2010 , @entity35 have played 60 international fixtures of which @entity3 has missed six , and five of those have ended in victory nonetheless			1
the greatest pull , therefore , is psychological			0
‘ @entity35 are @entity3 - dependent , ’ said @entity115			1
he meant as much in the mind as in the way they play			0
it has been noted , particularly against @entity114 , that the backline were frequently bypassing the midfield , in a desperate attempt to pick out their best player as if unable to contemplate an alternate route to goal			2
this attracted more criticism than any violence in @entity35 ’s play			1
it means the game against @entity78 can take two directions : either the team will look lost without their marquee match - winner , or they will have no choice but to play as 11 , rather than 10 , plus one			1
it would be foolish to say they will be better without @entity3 , but they might not be bereft			2
that is the hope , and the fervent prayer			0
and esperanca springs eternal in @entity35 , as it always does			0
@entity276 will raise their game - @entity368			0

there was hope that @entity3 could recover from his back injury in time to play the @entity5 final if they *overcome* @entity78 on tuesday night
the characteristic of @entity35 is hope , and they will still pray for a miracle
@entity28 have dealt with @entity3 ’s injury by emoting rather than analysing
*realistically* , the likes of @entity42 , @entity82 and @entity383 need to sprout wings
however , @entity386 midfielder @entity115 was apoplectic at @entity97 's sluggish performance against @entity114
@entity35 now must play as an 11 against @entity78 , not a 10 , plus one
