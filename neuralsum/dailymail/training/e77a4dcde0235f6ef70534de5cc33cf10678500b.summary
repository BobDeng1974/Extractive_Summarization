by @entity0 prime minister @entity2 's brother @entity1 claimed today a major fraud trial should be thrown out - because of legal - aid reforms prime minister @entity2 's barrister brother claimed today a major fraud trial should be thrown out because of legal - aid reforms introduced by his sibling 's government			1
@entity10 , who is representing seven defendants free of charge , argues that his legally aided clients could not find barristers ' of sufficient competence '			1
@entity16 , 35 , is said to have masterminded a Â£ 5million scam between 2008 and 2011 through the firms @entity18 @entity19 , @entity20 ( @entity21 ) and @entity22			0
he is accused alongside @entity23 , 30 , @entity24 , 27 , @entity25 , 46 , @entity26 , 24 , @entity27 , 28 , and @entity28 , 38 , of conspiracy to defraud			0
mr @entity2 does not represent mr @entity23			1
the eighth defendant , solicitor @entity30 , 53 , is facing fraud charges and an allegation of money laundering in relation to the case			0
the charges arose out of @entity37 , a @entity39 investigation into the activities of the land banking firms			0
all three firms involved have now been wound up , either voluntarily or in the face of civil proceedings brought in the last two years by the @entity39			0
today , mr @entity2 asked for the prosecution to be stopped , blaming the situation created by legal - aid cuts			1
he told @entity48 : ' the issue before the court today comes down , it seem to us , to this - whether the court accedes to the defence application , that the case should be stayed , or whether it accedes to the @entity57 's response to that , that there should be an adjournment ... of eight months until january			1
' the problem of lack of adequate representation or potential lack of adequate representation has been apparent since at least , we would submit , 14 november , 2013			0
' the state has failed to provide adequate representation to enable the trial to take place today , or indeed in this window , and it is now agreed that a trial can not take place without adequate representation			2
' mr @entity2 said there appeared to be no available lawyers of ' sufficient competence and skill '			1
he said the title ' queen 's counsel ' was ' a kite - mark ' of quality but that not enough could be found , who were willing to for the @entity81			2
nor could independent barristers be found , since they are refusing to work under current legal - aid rates			1
mr @entity2 asked for the prosecution to be stopped , blaming the situation created by legal - aid cuts ' at the moment we understand that there is only one identified silk available at the moment to conduct this trial , were it adjourned until january			1
' he added : ' two unidentified silks ' might be available later in the year , but this was still inadequate			0
' what we submit is that in this case , the state has known about the problem , has n't addressed the problem ... so that it 's now forced to ask for an adjournment			2
' @entity2 's government has overseen wholesale reform to the legal aid system , leading to dismay from the @entity106 mr @entity2 said the @entity57 wished to put the case ' on the never - never '			1
but he made clear he was concerned with the broader implications of the argument			0
' we do attribute the fault to the state more widely , ' mr @entity2 said			1
' the problem is this case is not the only case that has this problem			0
' at the moment there is a finite resource [ of barristers ] and too much capacity required			2
' is the position going to be that this case should swallow up the available silks ... so that these other cases are adjourned or stayed ? ' prosecutor @entity126 replied : ' the situation that now faces the court is an unusual one			2
' a stay is not an appropriate order and certainly never [ is ] , when there is an alternate remedy available			0
' neither of the standard categories of abuse [ of process ] apply			0
' mr @entity138 made clear that a recipient of legal - aid ' is not entitled to a choice of representation '			1
judge @entity143 asked whether a defendant may be entitled to choose from a ' pool ' of barristers instead			2
mr @entity138 replied there was nothing in the jurisprudence to support this idea			0
the justice secretary , @entity151 , has overseen wholesale reform to the legal aid system , leading to dismay from the @entity106			2
barristers and solicitors have already been hit with 30 per cent fee cuts in the most serious cases , prompting walk - outs and demonstrations			1
further reforms are set to introduce a two - tier contracting arrangement that vastly reduce the amount of law firms able to claim taxpayer funding			0
mr @entity151 has previously said : ' as everybody knows this government is dealing with an unprecedented financial challenge and i have no choice but to look for the savings i have to make across the full range of the @entity173 's work			1
' i can not exempt legal aid from this , but that does n't mean i do n't understand how challenging these reductions will be			1
' legal aid is a vital part of our justice system but we must ensure it is sustainable for those who need it , for those who provide legal services as part of it and for the taxpayer , who ultimately pays for it			2
' @entity16 , of @entity191 , @entity192 , @entity23 , of @entity193 , @entity24 , of @entity194 , south @entity195 , @entity196 and @entity26 , both @entity197 , @entity192 , @entity30 , of @entity198 , @entity28 , @entity199 , @entity192 , and @entity27 , of @entity200 , are all facing charges of conspiracy to defraud and carry on a regulated activity when not authorised			0
