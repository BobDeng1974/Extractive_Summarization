those of a more wholesome disposition , look away now			0
because below is a shocking - and equally creepy - depiction of what a futuristic female ‘ sex robot ’ might look like on the inside			1
the computer generated image reveals the complex wires and circuitry that might be in machines one day - among other more , ahem , risqué features			1
would you ? a @entity14 artist has created a depiction of futuristic ' sex robots ' ( shown )			1
the bizarre - and creepy - images reveal the ' innards ' of androids			1
they include artificial organs and a mechanical spine			1
but more unnervingly , they also have artificial ' reproductive organs '			1
some experts believe androids could become partners for humans in future the image was created by @entity14 artist @entity31			1
on his website he called it the ‘ new invention of the next century			0
’ the computer generated image was made for a robotic contest this year using a programme called @entity39 and rendered with @entity40			1
earlier this year two cybernetics experts gave their views on how robots might reproduce			1
novelist @entity44 said robots that are both silicon and carbon based , could have sex at a molecular level to produce offspring - although how this could happen is unclear			1
@entity53 expert professor @entity52 , meanwhile , said that there might not be any need to look at molecules as robots can be ' bred ' by swapping software , so the code used to make robots perform certain tasks particularly well can be combined to create a ' child '			1
he believes that robots of the future will be able to print their offspring , a little like a 3d printer , but could assemble them too			1
and mr @entity68 said if robots could have sex , it would defend them from computer viruses and make them more robust			1
the cutaway image appears to bear some resemblance to a crash test dummy on the exterior			0
the interior , though , is a different story			0
running down the ‘ back ’ of the robot is a metallic spine , obviously intending to replicate the real thing			2
elsewhere other organs area also recreated in all - too - accurate cgi			2
humorously - or bizarrely , depending on your view of this art piece - there ’s also a handy arrow in a suggestive position			0
despite its rather not - safe - for - work tone , though , the piece does at least provide what may be an accurate depiction of futuristic robots			1
namely , as attempts are made to make machines more and more human , it stands to reason we might some day create a robot with such artificial organs			1
and aside from lungs , a heart , bones and more , this may also include other artificial organs of a reproductive nature			1
earlier this year a study looked at how robots could replace several jobs in the next ten years			2
the one @entity115 survey , which marked the launch of a new sci - fi tv police drama called @entity118 , said in a decade streets could be governed my robocop - style police , taxis could drive themselves and prostitutes could be replaced by ‘ sexbots ’			0
it found that people feared the rise of artificial technology , and felt many jobs could be replaced sooner rather than later by machines			2
the @entity86 , shown , was made for a robotic contest this year using a programme called @entity39 and rendered with @entity40 look familiar ? despite its rather not - safe - for - work tone , though , the piece does at least provide what may be an accurate depiction of attempts to make futuristic robots more ' human ' running down the ‘ back ’ of the robot is a metallic spine ( shown ) , obviously intending to replicate the real thing			1

cooking / chefs ( 3 per cent ) among the top jobs people think will be replaced by robots by 2025 include soldiers ( 45 per cent ) , factory workers ( 33 per cent ) and astronauts ( 33 per cent )			1
the research also revealed many people think education will soon be led by androids , with 42 per cent believing teachers could be replaced by robots in the classroom in the future , and more than a tenth thinking it could happen in the next 20 years			1
and 17 per cent of those questioned said they ’d happily have sex with an android , while 29 per cent admitted they had no problem with other people enjoying android sex			2
more than one in ten even said they would like robotic offpsring , while nearly a fifth of pet owners said they would consider replacing a beloved animal with a robot			0
dr @entity194 , professor of robotics at the @entity196 , who oversaw the survey , said : ‘ i would expect robots to develop levels of emotional intelligence that will be greater than many humans including : thinking , judgement , problem solving , openness , self - control , self - analysis , and paying attention to and identifying people ’s feelings and emotions , for example			2
’ but he said that we do not need to feat a robot uprising just yet , adding : ‘ robots are being applied in fields described as the three ds , that is , tasks that are dirty , dangerous or dull			2
‘ the jobs most at risk are low - skill , routine , highly - structured , simple , and rule based , in environments that are static and structured			0
' it is unlikely that all the humans will be replaced by robots in any task , it is much more likely that fewer people will be needed because for many years robots will be assistants			0
' the future is most likely to be one of productivity gains rather than mass redundancies			0

a @entity14 artist has created a computer *genrated* depiction of futuristic ' sex robots '
the bizarre images reveal the ' innards ' of androids and they include artificial organs and a mechanical spine
but more unnervingly , they also have artificial ' reproductive organs '
some experts believe androids could become partners in future
