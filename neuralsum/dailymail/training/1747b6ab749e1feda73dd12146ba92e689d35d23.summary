by @entity0 published : 07:21 est , 27 august 2013 updated : 09:49 est , 27 august 2013 despite fending off bombs and bullets in the harsh environment of a @entity6 war zone , soldiers are complaining about one simple thing – sore feet			1
the @entity9 army are working to reinvent the humble army boot after soldiers complained about their footwear in a survey on conditions during operations			1
engineers are now in the final stages of a two - year project to develop boots so troops can comfortably negotiate arid terrains such as in @entity22			1
problems with boots , problems with everything : soldiers have complained about sore feet caused by their boots during deployment in harsh environments such as @entity22 and so the @entity9 army is working to develop a new , more comfortable boot the @entity9 army must now choose between three @entity9 agencies which have come up with different versions of the improved military footwear after calling for submissions back in 2011			1
@entity35 , a footwear project engineer at the @entity36 in @entity37 , said troops live and sleep in their boots			1
according to the @entity40 he said : ‘ if he ’s having problems with his boots , he ’s having problems with everything			2
’ extreme conditions : @entity47 ( left ) and @entity35 ( right ) have been working on developing boots with more ankle stability , traction and durability @entity47 , also from the research centre , said : ‘ due to @entity22 's unique climate and environment , they [ troops ] needed a boot that not only would provide them ankle stability and traction and durability , but they also needed greater breathability			1
‘ it 's a balancing act			0
we were constantly walking that fine line			0
i think that we have worked with industry tirelessly on trying to make sure that we accomplish exactly what the warfighter wants and needs			0
’ hold up in harsh conditions : the standard army combat boots do n't work as well in mountainous terrain , engineer @entity35 said the new boots are set to be about 0.5lbs lighter than boots currently worn by troops in @entity22 and will be able to withstand hot summer temperatures upward of 37 degrees @entity76			1
the three designs use different materials including leather , canvas , nylon and rubber to provide grip , protection and ventilation			0
mr @entity35 said : ‘ because of the mountainous terrain , the standard combat boots do n’t hold up as well			2
’ the different boots have been tested twice with over 200 soldiers donning the experimental footwear at the @entity90 in @entity90 , @entity91 under conditions similar to @entity22			1
researchers will either pick one of the designs or choose specific characteristics from each boot to create a new and improved version			0
each designer is using the same sole made by @entity9 shoe company @entity101			0
the unique sole has multidirectional lugs or spikes to give the shoes more grip while dislodging mud and debris as the soldier flexes the foot			0
one specialist design agency , @entity112 in @entity113 , @entity114 , used nylon , canvas and leather in its design , while the other two , @entity119 of @entity120 , @entity121 , and @entity122 in @entity123 , @entity124 , used more nylon for support			0
the @entity128 design uses leather and high - density nylon which has better ventilation than leather as well as being more light weight and thinner , allowing for flexibility			2
in the @entity119 design , holes were added for more ventilation while the @entity112 boot covers ventilation holes with mesh to stop dirt getting into the boot			0
@entity143 said its shoe contracts with the @entity9 army were worth £ 9.67 million in 2012			2
boots sell retail for £ 96 to £ 174 .			2

the @entity150 surveyed soldiers about conditions during operations
the biggest complaint was sore feet caused by *uncomfortable* army boots
engineers are in the final stages of a two - year plan to develop new boots so troops can negotiate arid terrains such as @entity22
