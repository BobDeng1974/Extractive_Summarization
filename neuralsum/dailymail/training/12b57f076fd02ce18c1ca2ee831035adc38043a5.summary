@entity0 believes @entity1 has turned @entity2 into a much tougher side than the one @entity4 so easily overcame a month ago			1
@entity4 ' 3 - 1 triumph at @entity6 on @entity7 proved the catalyst for change in south @entity10			1
@entity11 was promptly sacked by the struggling @entity2 , who head into saturday 's @entity14 fourth - round tie at @entity15 's riding the crest of a wave			1
@entity1 left his post at @entity19 earlier this month to replace @entity11 at @entity2 @entity20 scores for @entity2 during a 3 - 2 comeback win for @entity1 's side away at @entity23 @entity4 boss @entity0 has heaped praise on @entity1 for the turnaround he has overseen the appointment of @entity1 has brought with it an impressive change in fortunes at @entity2 , with their former player overseeing three successive wins in all competitions			1
' they have a spirit in the team , the confidence and they have had a great start ( under @entity1 ) , ' @entity0 said of @entity2			1
' the first win ( against @entity39 ) was normally an easy @entity14 round for them , but the first victory in the @entity43 against @entity44 gave everybody confidence			2
' at the moment they are more difficult to beat than over @entity48 on @entity7			2
' they have new players and a new manager and that always means some changes in tactics or organisation in the team and i think the manager is more happy than he was before , and that 's important			0
' @entity2 forward @entity60 has been in superb form for the @entity2 since @entity1 took over @entity1 , who spent four years as a player at @entity6 , has proved very popular with @entity2 fans @entity2 sit 13th in the standings ahead of @entity1 's trip to the club he led to the @entity67 in 2010			1

' i am lucky , ' @entity0 said			2
' i do n't have a lot of numbers of players to think about to make changes			0
' the players who was n't available in the last week are still not available for this weekend			0
' that means we have 17 or 18 players and of that 17 or 18 players we have already five or six under - 21 players			0
' there is no time and no reason to think about making changes and we will put out the strongest team we can			0
