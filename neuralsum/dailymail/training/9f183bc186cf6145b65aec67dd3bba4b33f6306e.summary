by @entity0 published : 18:45 est , 3 october 2012 updated : 05:08 est , 4 october 2012 plenty of television innovations have come along over the years , promising to ‘ change for ever ’ our viewing habits			0
@entity6 came colour pictures on @entity8 in 1967			0
@entity13 was hailed as the next breakthrough			0
tv on your mobile phone was another			0
but , as yet , few have matched the popularity of multi-channel packages			0
now , though , the new @entity22 system is being touted as the technology that could change the way we watch tv			1
while @entity37 from the @entity8 and the equivalent catch - up services from other broadcasters enable you to view shows you ’ve missed , they involve a modicum of basic computer skills			1
for those people who are able to grasp these , it ’s also possible to connect a laptop showing @entity37 to your tv			2
but @entity22 has for the first time integrated standard tv and internet tv in a more or less seamless way , so archived programmes on these ‘ catch - up ’ services can be fed into your living room tv regardless of your computer skills			1
the main advantage of @entity22 is that it has an on - screen guide ( accessible at the touch of a button ) , showing programmes that were screened during the past seven days as well as those due to be broadcast over the next seven days on all the main channels			1
even the dreaded ‘ buffering ’ , the frustrating intermittent delay often experienced while programmes download to a computer , has largely been done away with			2
and by removing all the hassles involved in using the tv stations ’ already available catch - up services , @entity22 has pulled off the trick much - loved by clever firms — taking a technology that ’s already proven and adding a bit of magic to make it easy to use and desirable			1
in fact , being able to go back in time on your programme guide already exists on @entity75 , but the launch of @entity22 is expected to see it really take off			1
the @entity22 system has for the first time integrated standard tv and internet tv in a ' more or less seamless ' way @entity22 has other benefits			1
the main one is that it gets you a wider variety of channels than a standard @entity12 box , but without any subscription charges			1
@entity22 offers more than 70 tv and radio channels , some in high definition , as well as a further 300 so - called ‘ content providers ’ , such as @entity94 ’s @entity93 ( the online film rental service ) , which are in the process of joining the service			1
@entity93 has already announced as a first step that anyone subscribing to a phone and internet package with @entity102 who opts for a @entity22 box will get 12 months access to its film and television library			1
newly released films and paid - for sports events will also soon be available on a pay - as - you - go basis - and without the need for a satellite dish			0
however , the major drawback to @entity22 is that even though there are no subscriptions to pay , it will be expensive to get the initial equipment			2
the @entity22 set top box currently being sold costs £ 299			1
but these start - up costs are expected to soon come down			0
many internet service providers — such as @entity121 and @entity102 - will soon be offering a @entity22 box as part of their broadband deal , typically for no more than a £ 50 charge			1
existing @entity121 and @entity102 customers will be offered a £ 50 upgrade to the new box			0
so if you think you would benefit from @entity22 ’s ‘ tv time traveller ’ facility - and you baulk at those expensive @entity10 and @entity75 subscriptions - is @entity22 the innovation for you ? here are a few questions you may be asking			1
so is this cable , satellite or what ? @entity22 is neither and requires no drilling or messy installation			2
presuming you have a good outdoor aerial , you can access the 70 or so @entity12 channels with no fuss			1
to get full use of the service , however , you ’ll need a broadband connection running at a minimum speed of 3 @entity148 — which is not yet available in some rural areas			0
ideally , you ’ll need 5 mbps			0
if you have a satellite dish but no longer have an aerial , you would need to get one installed — and check that there ’s a good old - fashioned tv signal in your area — not always the case in some parts of the countryside			2
will it work with an older tv ? yes , but they wo n’t allow you to experience the box ’s high definition ( hd ) capabilities			2
how many channels can it get ? @entity22 gets all the 74 @entity12 channels , plus a lot of radio stations			1
then , apart from the programme guide , there ’s a section called on demand , where you can find @entity37 and all the other main catch - up websites			1
hundreds of other channels are planning to set up in the @entity177 section			0
can it get @entity179 ? this is the big question - especially for many men			0
the answer is ‘ no ’ - unless you get your @entity22 box by subscribing to @entity102 and signing up for their broadband deal , on which you can pay for @entity179 one to four			1
if you get @entity22 through @entity121 , or buy a box outright in a @entity189 shop , you ca n’t yet get @entity179			2
does it bump up internet costs ? yes - it ’s important to check your current broadband contract does n’t have a data limit			0
older broadband contracts did n’t envisage people getting most of their tv from the internet , and downloading , say , an @entity163 film could use @entity199 — which may be a large part of your monthly data allowance , after which you will be surcharged			0
the kind of broadband contracts offered with a new @entity22 box will offer unlimited data			2
what if you ’ve got two or more tv sets ? the @entity22 box works only with one tv ; if you want @entity22 in other rooms , you ’ll need to buy more boxes			1
several boxes can ‘ feed ’ off one broadband connection , but the wiring required is complex and you ’ll need to pay an engineer to fix it			0
is it worth buying now , or is it best to wait ? now is fine if you do n’t mind the steep initial price			0
because the box is internet connected , any upgrades will be made automatically by @entity22 , so new features — such as the crucial @entity179 — will be added to your box			1
can i control what my kids watch ? yes , and also , if you try to watch something recorded after the watershed in daylight hours , a warning will flash up and a pin number will be requested — which hopefully your children wo n’t know			0
so what are @entity22 ’s drawbacks ? not many - something which worries the likes of @entity10			2
no wonder @entity240 initially tried to block @entity22 setting up			0
one current niggle is that the first box launched does n’t have built - in @entity243 , meaning you have to plug it into your router			0
of course this is not very convenient though , and a strange oversight , since so many millions of homes have @entity243 .			0

new @entity22 system allows viewers to access broadcasters ' catch - up services through their tv without the need for computer skills
features an on - screen guide showing programmes that have been screened over previous week
set top box provides wider variety of channels than standard @entity12 box
