alone but for a bottle of wine , a master of motor racing will sit down on his sofa to watch @entity5 and @entity7 ’s final duel for the @entity10 drivers ’ championship of the world			1
in the @entity14 commune of @entity15 , 80 miles northeast of @entity16 , @entity12 will be content whoever emerges victorious from the desert finale in @entity19			1
‘ being on my own i can scream , cry , be happy , ’ says @entity12 , a legend of the karting world , who offers a unique perspective having managed @entity5 and @entity7 as young karters in @entity23 , @entity25 @entity24 , in 2000 - 2001			1
@entity5 and @entity7 formed a deep bond during their days racing karts ‘ i do n’t want to be with someone who is actively supporting either @entity5 or @entity7			1
i ’ll be happy regardless of the result			2
i can even start the wine on the formation lap , and maybe have another bottle , champagne perhaps , after the race			2
’ @entity12 knows the two combatants by their old nicknames : @entity7 , being white and rich and from @entity38 , was known as @entity39 ; @entity5 , being darker , was called @entity40			1
he talks about the boys - turned - men as personalities and performers			2
they were 15 and 16 at the time and firm friends as well as karting rivals when they came under @entity12 ’s aegis			1
and he believes that , despite the pair ’s jousting , an essential bond remains between them			1
‘ we built the team specifically for them both — a gentleman ’s agreement with @entity59 , who was in charge of the @entity24 young driver programme that @entity5 was on , and @entity62 , @entity7 ’s dad , who was looking after his son ’s career , ’ says @entity12			1
@entity5 and @entity7 were friends long before this year ’s thrilling title race ‘ @entity5 and @entity7 were meant to be together for three years but they were so quick they stepped up to cars after two years			1
@entity7 went to @entity71 and @entity5 to @entity72			1
‘ i remember them as young boys			2
a karting team is small , just five or six of us including the drivers			2
it is a little family			2
the boys usually slept together			0
‘ karting at that age is professional to a degree but not the way it is in @entity10			0
there were funny moments too			0
one night i remember reception at the hotel we were staying ringing me up to say that the bedding was being thrown out of their room			0
it started with a pillow and ended up with a mattress			0
‘ even @entity97 ( @entity5 ’s father ) and @entity62 got on well			1
there was a joke among the others that @entity97 was not a very good driver , unlike the rest of them			0
he was always the one driving the rental car though			0
one time @entity62 pulled the handbrake as @entity97 was driving			0
the car spun in the @entity108 and went into the water hole at the side			0
‘ @entity7 was laughing in the back and saying , “ my dad pulled the handbrake ”			0
@entity62 was famous for not spending much money — very @entity122 , as you say in @entity123			0
one time in @entity124 , you had to pay $ 2 to get on a bridge over a stream to take you to the car park			0
@entity62 did not want to pay it and instead drove the pick - up into the stream			2
this time @entity5 was laughing			1
@entity5 leads the championship by 17 points but scores count double in @entity19 ‘ @entity5 was more mature			1
@entity7 had to learn from him			0
i believe they are still friends			2
i remember the @entity130 @entity10 in 2008			0
they had their first podium together in @entity10			0
@entity5 called me early in the morning because of the time difference			1
‘ he was so happy			0
he said it was like their go - karting days : he and @entity7 together on the podium			2
that ’s why i believe there is still friendship there			0
it is impossible to be enemies after all that			0
’ the maths favours @entity5 going into the last race at @entity19 ’s @entity147 track			1
he leads the championship by 17 points but with the scores counting double at the final round that is not as commanding a lead as it might sound			1
a victory would be the most direct way for @entity5 to win his second title			1
but if @entity7 won the race , @entity5 would need to come second			1
if @entity7 were second , @entity5 would need to come fifth			1
if @entity7 were third , @entity5 would need to come sixth			1
given the sheer dominance of their @entity25 cars , any other permutation is surely no more than theoretical			0
many observers were surprised by @entity7 beating @entity5 to another landmark this season : he leads 10 poles to seven			1
‘ i predicted before the season that this is how i thought it would go , with @entity7 having more poles and @entity5 being faster in races , ’ he says			1
‘ @entity7 needs to build up to his limit , which is why qualifying suits him			0
@entity5 can go to the limit immediately without build - up , and that helps when they race			1
he is more aggressive and better at knowing when to overtake			0
he makes it look easy			0
it is not so easy for @entity7 , who is more smooth , safe and consistent			0
’ it is a statement on the lifestyle of his two former charges that @entity12 expects to speak only to @entity7 before next sunday			1
that is because @entity5 is out of reach — the sport ’s global superstar , a status that has won him @entity186 ’s support			1
he believes a @entity5 championship would do more to promote his billion - pound circus			1
@entity12 says : ‘ i ’ll talk to @entity7 for sure			2
he is polite , calmer			0
when he is home , he is home			0
he has less time to spend with people — i do n’t mean that in a bad way ; it is normal when you become more of a vip			0
i think he wants to spend time with his friends and girlfriend			2
i am not part of his family			0
‘ @entity5 has changed his phone number many times and it is n’t always easy to get hold of him			2
but he has my number if he wants me			0
’ @entity12 , guiding the next track stars of the future after more than 30 years in the business , still has equal time for his @entity39 and his @entity40			2
the maths favours @entity5 going into the last race at @entity19 ’s @entity147 track			1

@entity12 managed the pair as young karters in 2000 - 2001
the @entity14 says the pair formed a strong bond and are still friends
