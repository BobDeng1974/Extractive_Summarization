having less than six hours sleep a night can cause serious health problems turn off the @entity1 in bed if you want to avoid getting fat , warn researchers			1
lack of sleep caused by the stimulation of electronic devices ranging from portable computers to gaming devices could be fuelling obesity , it is claimed			1
even watching tv before dropping off has been linked to sleep difficulties that can trigger health problems , says a new research review from scientists			1
they are calling on doctors to ' prescribe ' a good night 's sleep because it may prevent common metabolic disorders , including growing numbers of cases of type 2 diabetes			2
millions of @entity26 - around one in four adults - have sleeping difficulties and up to one in 10 has an insomnia disorder that can affect their everyday lives through fatigue and mood disturbances			1
research shows people who have between six and eight hours sleep a night are likely to live longer and have better health , while those getting less than six hours are more at risk of dying prematurely			1
scientists at @entity39 found just one week of poor sleep can disrupt hundreds of genes linked to stress , immunity and inflammation			1
sleep deprivation has long been known to affect brain function , reducing alertness and cognitive ability , and in recent years has been thought to contribute to physical illnesses			2
experts believe poor sleep directly disrupts insulin levels , a hormone that regulates energy through the body 's fat cells			1
using electronic devices , such as laptops , shortly before bed can disrupt healthy sleep patters , a study claims a new research review in @entity63 journal , says experimental studies are showing a direct causal link between sleep loss and the body 's ability to metabolise sugar , control food intake , and maintain energy balance			1
@entity73 and @entity74 scientists report that disruption of the body 's natural sleeping and waking cycle by shift work may contribute to chronic illness and early death			1
but lifestyle factors in ' globalised 24hour societies ' are interfering with people 's sleep quotas , claim the scientists , led by professor @entity87 , from the @entity88 and @entity89 in @entity90			2
he said ' voluntary sleep curtailment ' is commonly caused by the use of technical devices for gaming , online shopping , social networking or watching television			0
' programmes of sleep education and cognitive behavioural therapies focusing on improved sleep hygiene might represent promising approaches to induce behavioural changes ' he said			0
even as babies , children who do not get enough sleep eat far more than those who sleep a healthy amount such targeted interventions could help curb the present epidemic of the metabolic syndrome and related diseases			0
' ongoing and future studies will show whether interventions to improve sleep duration and quality can prevent or even reverse adverse metabolic traits			0
' meanwhile , on the basis of existing evidence , health care professionals can be safely recommended to motivate their patients to enjoy sufficient sleep at the right time of day ' he added			0
@entity125 children who sleep less eat more , which can lead to obesity and related health problems later in life , reports a new study by @entity131 ( @entity131 ) researchers			1
the study found that 16 month - old children who slept for less than 10 hours each day consumed on average 105kcal more per day than children who slept for more than 13 hours			0
this is an increase of around 10 per cent from 982kcal to 1087kcal			0
a new study , published in the @entity138 , is the first to directly link sleep to energy intake in children under the age of 3 years			0
the study , funded by @entity144 , involved 1303 @entity26 families , monitoring sleep when children were 16 months old and diet at 21 months old			2
' we know that shorter sleep in early life increases the risk of obesity , so we wanted to understand whether shorter sleeping children consume more calories ' said dr @entity156 of the @entity157 at @entity131			2
' previous studies in adults and older children have shown that sleep loss causes people to eat more , but in early life parents make most of the decisions about when and how much their children eat , so young children can not be assumed to show the same patterns			2
' the key message here is that shorter sleeping children may be prone to consume too many calories , " says dr @entity156			0
" ' although more research is needed to understand why this might be , it is something parents should be made aware of ' said dr @entity156			0
it is thought the regulation of appetite hormones may become disrupted by shorter sleeping patterns .			0

lack of sleep can cause serious problems with mental and physical health
study claims using electronic devices before bed disrupts sleep patterns
one in four @entity26 have difficulty sleeping and one in ten have insomnia
having less than six hours sleep a night can increase chance of early death
*modern* lifestyle , especially shift work , wreaks havoc with healthy sleep
childhood obesity has been linked to poor sleep in numerous studies
