by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 06:18 est , 11 october 2013 updated : 06:29 est , 11 october 2013 @entity3 ’s top tax officials are to face tough questions about their failure to make big businesses pay their way as damning new figures show £ 35billion - a - year goes uncollected			1
@entity9 today admitted that the so - called ‘ tax gap ’ has despite public outrage at avoidance schemes used by the likes of @entity13 , @entity14 and comedian @entity15			1
the taxpayer lost £ 35billion in unpaid tax in 2011 - 12 , a figure which has remained almost static for the last five years			1
gap : new figures show how the amount of tax owed which is not collected has barely changed since 2005 @entity9 boasted that as a percentage of all taxes owed , the amount which goes uncollected has ‘ fallen steadily over the last six years ’			1
but the @entity27 spending watchdog is to grill officials from @entity9 in the coming weeks over the lack of significant progress in collecting tax owed to the @entity32			1
exchequer secretary @entity33 said : ‘ these figures show the tax gap is continuing to fall			2
the vast majority of businesses and individuals pay the taxes they owe			0
‘ but where they do n’t it is for @entity9 to challenge non-compliance fiercely , protecting money that would otherwise be lost			2
’ this week it emerged @entity14 paid no corporation tax in @entity3 last year despite raking in more than £ 200million from its @entity3 operations , documents reveal			0
it means the internet giant has paid just £ 1million in corporation tax on the half a billion pounds of revenue it has made since arriving in @entity3 in 2007			0
@entity55 up : @entity57 chairman @entity56 said @entity9 had failed to make a dent in the figures @entity13 was accused in may this year of ‘ doing evil ’ by avoiding @entity3 taxes			1
@entity62 also attracted criticism after it emerged last year that it had paid no @entity3 corporation tax in the previous three years			2
in january last year stand - up @entity15 admitted to a ‘ terrible error of judgement ’ after it emerged he used the @entity70 scheme which enabled members to pay income tax rates as low as 1 per cent			0
ahead of the hearing @entity56 , the chairman of the @entity57 , told @entity1 : ‘ i do n’t think they are assertive or aggressive enough			2
‘ i am really disappointed that , despite all the public concern expressed by hardworking people who do pay their taxes , there has not been greater success			0
‘ there is scepticism about how they calculate the tax gap anyway , it is a conservative estimate			0
‘ only this week we had the news about @entity14 and others			0
‘ whilst i recognise that we have to take action internationally , it does n’t excuse @entity9 not defending the taxpayers ’ ’ interest or their failure to make a noticeable dent in the figures			1
’ the value of the tax gap has increased from £ 32billion in 2009 - 10 to £ 35 billion in 2011 - 12			0
the percentage tax gap has fallen very slightly from 7.3 per cent to 7 per cent over the same period			2
@entity100 , @entity9 ’s @entity101 , said : ‘ the range of non-compliance behaviours revealed by these tax gap figures underline why it is so important for @entity9 to step up our wide - ranging activities against the minority who are n’t paying what ’s due , whether they are @entity110 , individuals , big business or organised criminals			1
‘ this is n’t just critical for the nation ’s finances : it ’s also important to protect the vast majority of honest businesses and individuals from being cheated by the unscrupulous few			0
’ but @entity121 , @entity122 's shadow exchequer secretary said : ' at a time when millions are struggling with the rising cost of living and the deficit is high , it 's even more vital that everyone pays their fair share of tax			1
' but these figures show the government is failing to tackle tax avoidance and evasion with the value of the tax gap now up to £ 35 billion			1
' and @entity137 is so out of touch that he 's just given a £ 3 billion tax cut to people on over £ 150,000 , while falling real wages mean ordinary working people are on average £ 1500 a year worse off			0

@entity9 under fire after failing to tackle unpaid tax
7 *%* of all tax owed still goes unpaid despite years of anger about avoidance
@entity57 to grill officials about failure to ' dent ' figures
@entity122 says government is failing to tackle scale of tax evasion
