the 26 - year - old wife of former @entity1 of @entity4 star @entity3 's 79 - year - old father @entity2 has revealed intimate details about the couple 's ' steamy ' marriage , insisting that , despite their 53 - year age gap , the couple 's love life is more passionate than ever			1
@entity12 , who married reality star @entity2 in an intimate ceremony in @entity14 last year - which his daughter @entity15 chose not to attend - explained to @entity17 that , before meeting @entity2 , she was close to giving up on the idea of finding a soul mate who would live up to her standards			1
' before @entity2 , i only ever dated men my age or younger and i ’d never had an orgasm , ’ @entity12 , who is from @entity21 , says			1
but then i met a man 53 years older than me and finally i see what all the fuss is about			1
‘ my husband has the stamina of a 20 - year - old			1
@entity2 thinks nothing of making love to me for at least five hours every night and he wears me out ! ’ the couple 's unconventional romance began in march 2011 , when @entity2 , who appeared on a number of episodes of @entity1 before his daughter @entity15 was fired from the reality series last year , walked into @entity12 's @entity21 salon for a pedicure			1
thanks to his healthy tan , the manicurist admits that she thought the infamous playboy - who became renowned among @entity1 viewers and castmembers alike for his ' sickening ' , ' inappropriate ' and ' disgusting ' behavior towards women - was as young as 60 years old			2
and when @entity2 asked her for an email address following his appointment , @entity12 insists that she had no idea he was looking to pursue anything other than a business relationship			1
but two months later , he surprised her by asking her out on a date			0
‘ i wo n’t lie , at first it never even crossed my mind to see @entity2 as anything other than a successful businessman who could help me grow my business , ' she says			2
' but i could n't see the harm in in saying yes			0
’ the pair shared a romantic candlelit meal and @entity12 began to feel a mutual attraction			2
‘ the more time i spent with @entity2 , the more i began to fancy him , ' she recalls			2
happy couple : the pair married in an intimate ceremony on the beach in @entity14 , which @entity2 's daughter , former @entity1 of @entity4 star @entity3 , chose not to attend moving on : @entity2 's first wife , @entity15 's mother , passed away a number of years ago ‘ i loved how intelligent , successful and charismatic he was and suddenly the age difference did n’t seem to matter so much			1
’ and while @entity2 's over-the - top sexual antics were the source of much horror among @entity15 's @entity1 co-stars , it seems to have worked wonders with @entity12			1
about a month into their relationship the pair slept together for the first time , and @entity12 revealed that any concerns she had about their severe age gap quickly disappeared after the pair spent their first night together			2
‘ until i met @entity2 i had never ever experienced an orgasm , ' she admits			2
‘ but the first time we slept together , all that changed			0
‘ i thought he might have a wrinkly body and need @entity111			0
but @entity2 ’s physique is unbelievable as he works out every day – and @entity111 was the last thing he needed			2
‘ he ’d studied @entity114 sex in @entity115 and i lost count of the number of times we had sex , but we were still at it when the sun came up			0
‘ he was so skilled , he blew my mind			0
i lost count of how many orgasms i had			0
' ironically , while @entity2 's talents in the bedroom proved particularly effective when it came to wooing his wife , his playboy lifestyle seemed to have the opposite effect on the @entity1 - and their viewers			1
indeed , castmember @entity132 once went as far as to say of the aging lothario and his ' uncomfortable ' behavior : ' the problem is he 's so over the top , it 's uncomfortable to watch			0
' i love a good drama - whether a screaming match or a hair pulling - but i 'm with the audience on this one : get @entity2 off the tv			1
@entity144 : during his appearances on his daughter 's reality show , @entity2 formed a reputation with her castmates for his overtly sexual behavior @entity152 - filled fun : @entity2 and @entity12 insist that their age gap does not bother them ' it 's sickening to hear an old man sexually degrade women in all kinds of vile ways			1
' but despite his less - than - chivalrous behavior during his appearance on @entity1 , it did n't take much for @entity2 to win @entity12 over - and the couple 's relationship quickly began to go from strength to strength , despite the then - 23 - year - old not even knowing his real age			1
despite knowing @entity2 was a widower with three daughters and two sons , all older than her , @entity12 admits that she did n't actually ask his real age until six months after the pair began dating			1
‘ by then i was so in love , i did n't care , ' she admits			0
' but on his birthday , i said to him , “ tell me the truth			0
” ‘ he took a big drink of wine and took my car keys from me in case i ran away			0
then he said : “ i ’m 77			0
‘ so many things ran through my mind , about the prospect of having children with someone so much older , or the possibility of him dying years before me			2
‘ but i could n't let age stand in the way of true happiness with my soul mate			0
’ in august 2013 , @entity2 proposed during a family dinner at his daughter ’s house and the happy couple tied the knot in a romantic ceremony on the beach in @entity14 a year later			1
and while @entity2 's daughter @entity15 , who was often forced to defend her father 's shocking behaviour to her castmates , did not choose to attend the couple 's wedding , @entity12 insists that the 44 - year - old gave them ' full blessing ' before they walked down the aisle			1
‘ @entity2 ’s kids gave us their full blessing , ' she explains			1
family ties : although @entity15 ( r ) chose not to attend her father 's wedding to @entity12 , the couple insist that the 44 - year - old gave them her blessing motherhood : @entity15 and her husband @entity221 ( @entity223 ) have two children together ( pictured ) ' after losing their mum , they are glad to see him so happy again			1
it was so romantic and afterwards we flew to @entity229 on honeymoon			0
’ but not everyone has been so thrilled for the couple			0
@entity12 admits that some friends have accused her of acting like a ‘ prostitute ’ in marrying @entity2 , who is reported to be worth about $ 50 million			1
‘ to this day , people point and snigger if they see us holding hands or kissing , ' @entity12 admits			2
' it did upset me , but i 've grown a thicker skin and refuse to let some people ’s small mindedness ruin our happiness			0
‘ @entity2 is not my sugar daddy			2
i am a successful woman in my own right			0
' i did n't need looking after by a rich man before and i do n’t now either			0
i married him for love			0
anyone who spends five minutes with us will know we ’re the real deal			0
’ @entity12 says that the pair are desperate to start a family as soon as possible - so desperate in fact , that @entity2 revealed during an appearance on @entity1 that he has had his sperm frozen so that @entity12 can opt to have his children even after he has died			1
but @entity12 insists that she has put any fears about @entity2 dying before he gets to see their unborn child grow up to the back of her mind			1
‘ of course i worry , but life is too short and for all i know , i could die before him , ' she says			0
‘ i think i am the luckiest woman in the world to have found @entity2			2
in our eyes love is not a number			0

@entity12 married @entity2 in an intimate ceremony in @entity14 last year
@entity15 , who is 20 years older than her new *stepmother* , chose not to attend the couple 's wedding , however @entity12 insists she gave them her blessing
according to @entity12 the couple are happier than ever - and are ' desperately ' trying for a baby
