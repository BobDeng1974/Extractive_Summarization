@entity1 striker @entity0 produced most of the most spectacular misses of recent times against fellow @entity5 2 side @entity4 on wednesday night			1
the 21 - year - old had the goal at his mercy from just two yards out but somehow contrived to lift the ball agonisingly over the bar			2
luckily for @entity0 his side were still able to secure maximum points from the encounter with a 1 - 0 win , otherwise he could have well been in hot water with his manager @entity16			0
@entity1 striker @entity0 is well placed in the box to tap home from team - mate @entity19 the ball looks perfectly placed for @entity0 to give the hosts the lead @entity0 looks set to make the perfect connection with the ball inside the area @entity0 looks on in disbelief as the ball flies over the crossbar as he scored remained goalless @entity0 ca n't believe his eyes after his spectacular miss from close range ironically the man who crossed the ball over to @entity0 - @entity19 - popped up with the winner later in the game			0
@entity0 will now join the ever - growing list of the likes of @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 et al in some of the spectacular misses seen in the game .			1

@entity0 somehow *scooped* the ball over from two yards for @entity1 on wednesday in their league meeting with @entity4
the 21 - year - old looked on in *despair* after the *incredible* open - goal miss
he joins the likes of @entity38 and @entity39 in the ever - growing list of the most spectacular misses from recent times in *football*
