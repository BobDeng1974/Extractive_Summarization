the first six @entity1 patients have been implanted with a wireless pacemaker – smaller than an aaa battery – that is set to revolutionise the treatment of heart disease			1
@entity7 pacemakers , which have changed little since 1958 , regulate the pulse by sending electrical impulses into the heart via leads from a battery pack , implanted under the collarbone			1
the @entity14 , which has no leads , is a tenth of the size of the traditional device and sits permanently in one of the chambers of the heart			1
it can take under ten minutes to position , compared with up to 45 minutes for an old - style pacemaker			1
it is inserted through a vein via an incision in the leg , leaving no scars , and held in place by a screw - like anchor , which grips the inner wall of the heart			1
aside from being an easier procedure , doctors hope the innovation will help eliminate complications caused by traditional pacemakers and their leads , which include infections and clots			1
@entity39 , 77 , was one of those given the new device at @entity42 in @entity43 this month			2
she says : ‘ i was waiting for the sedation to kick in so that the surgeon could start			2
suddenly he said it was over			2
he had implanted a pacemaker into my heart in just seven minutes and i was completely oblivious			1
’ professor @entity49 , who performed the procedure , says : ‘ this is an incredible step			2
it has been dreamt about for years			2
i ’m excited to be the first @entity1 cardiologist to implant the device			1
’ last year , more than 40,000 @entity1 had a pacemaker fitted			1
they are used to treat a variety of arrhythmias : problems with the rate or rhythm of the heartbeat			2
revolution : the new pacemaker could change the lives of millions of heart patients in traditional pacemakers , up to three electrical leads run into the heart			1
should the pacemaker sense abnormal rhythm , an electrical pulse is delivered			1
however , prof @entity49 says : ‘ it is almost inevitable that some revision surgery will be performed			2
at most , the leads will last 15 years , so they will require replacement			1
take away the box and leads and that risk of related complications is removed			1
’ the @entity14 is implanted directly into the heart in a minimally invasive procedure under local anaesthetic			1
a small amount of sedation is given to the patient and local anaesthetic injected into the top of the leg			2
the pacemaker is inserted up the femoral vein in the leg within a flexible tube			1
when it is in the correct position , the pacemaker – at one end of which is a screw – is carefully pushed into the wall of the heart and turned one - and - a - quarter times			1
mention tv drama @entity101 to cardiologists and you may elicit a weary sigh			2
one episode famously featured @entity106 , played by @entity107 , hacking into vice president @entity109 ’s pacemaker to deliver a fatal shock			1
patients often ask professor @entity49 : ‘ could this really happen ? ’ the speculation about hacking relates to pacemakers using radio frequency – which allows communication between the device and the programmers in a clinic or hospital			2
‘ every time you initiate programming you have to have a wand held physically over the pacemaker , ’ he explains			1
‘ the patient also has to be within 6ft of a modem			2
’ some pacemakers have the ability to act as a defibrillator – as @entity109 ’s did – so arguably a homicidal doctor with all the right kit , in the same room as the patient could deliver a large painful shock			2
but this is unlikely to be fatal			0
the @entity14 uses a different communication method – with a professional physically placing electrodes on the body – and it ca n’t be remotely monitored			1
so technically it would be even safer in such – implausible – circumstances			0
‘ we check it ’s in a good position by tugging gently , ’ says prof @entity49			0
‘ like all pacemakers , it is battery powered and contains a computer chip which monitors electrical activity			0
should it sense silence , a tinyelectrical pulse is released			0
‘ most patients are interested in the lack of scar and bulky pacemaker , ’ he says			1
‘ but we are thrilled about the lack of leads			1
’ the chances of the device dislodging and floating free are low , says prof @entity49			0
‘ should it dislodge , it would go into the lung and could be easily retrieved			0
it ’s so small it would n’t block blood flow			0
’ the battery lasts up to 13 years			0
‘ at the end of this time you can either remove and replace it , or insert another one next to it , ’ says prof @entity49			0
@entity39 , who lives with her husband @entity172 , 75 , in @entity173 , @entity174 , is of course one of the @entity14 ’s biggest fans			1
she could n’t even walk up the stairs without taking a rest			0
she developed atrial fibrillation a decade ago and following a stroke was on medication to slow her heartbeat			0
but this meant that her heart rate could drop to a dangerous 40 beats per minute			0
when she wore a monitor for a week , it stopped 41 times for up to 4.5 seconds			0
‘ usually this happened at night , ’ explains @entity39			0
‘ but they were worried it might happen in the day and i ’d hurt myself			0
even the slight slope walking up my road exhausted me			0
’ she was waiting for a normal pacemaker to be installed , but prof @entity49 thought she would be ideal for the @entity14			1
‘ i was very stressed before the procedure , ’ says @entity39			0
‘ but once i was in there it flashed past			0
i was able to walk to the loo later that evening			0
i could n’t believe there was something in my heart			0
’ she is feeling much more energetic and is also sleeping soundly			0
‘ before , i ’d wake up at night with my heart just beating madly			0
’ dr @entity204 , consultant cardiologist at @entity206 , @entity43 , and @entity208 @entity207 , suggests a downside is the chance of blood leaking around the heart during insertion			0
‘ it could cause complications , but you are still avoiding problems with the wires , the bulky box and the risk of infection			0
’ @entity14 ’s @entity223 manufacturers , @entity222 , say that pacemakers are being implanted on a case - by - case basis depending on the patient			1

the first six @entity1 have been fit with no leads pacemaker @entity14
the new pacemaker is the tenth of the size of a traditional pacemaker
it takes under ten minutes to fit , compared to the current 45 minutes
