a @entity1 television station has been forced to make a humiliating apology after an on - air gaffe resulted in a live racist joke about the fatal @entity6 plane crash			2
during the midday broadcast on friday , presenter @entity7 , announced that her news station , @entity9 , had just learned the names of the four pilots who were on board @entity13 when it crashed at @entity14 on saturday			1
she then proceeded to read out four fake names from a teleprompter whilst keeping a straight face			2
it is not yet clear where the names originated but the broadcaster did confirm them with the @entity23 before airing them			1
the safety board said a summer intern told @entity9 the names were correct			1
the video of the cringe - worthy mistake has gone viral and drawn heavy criticism on the @entity41			0
the first name — ' captain @entity43 ' might have been a giveaway that something was not quite right			0
however , with the camera 's rolling and in the middle of a live broadcast , ms. @entity7 continued to read without so much as flinching : ' @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53			0
' after an ad break , the station was quick to correct the gaffe clarifying that the names were clearly wrong and blaming the @entity23 for the incorrect information			1
in a statement the @entity23 admitted a summer intern had ' erroneously ' confirmed the names of the flight crew and was ' acting outside the scope of his authority ' in doing so			1
' the @entity23 apologizes for inaccurate and offensive names that were mistakenly confirmed as those of the pilots of @entity13 , which crashed at @entity14 on july 6 , ' the @entity23 said in a statement			1
' earlier today , in response to an inquiry from a media outlet , a summer intern acted outside the scope of his authority when he erroneously confirmed the names of the flight crew on the aircraft , ' it added			1
days earlier , @entity9 news director @entity80 was crowing about how good his news operation had performed			2
' being first on air and on every platform in all aspects of our coverage was a great accomplishment , but being 100 % accurate , effectively using our great sources and social media without putting a single piece of erroneous information on our air , is what we are most proud of as a newsroom			0
' the station issued a statement on friday afternoon acknowledging it had ' misidentified the pilots involved			0
' third victim : a @entity1 hospital says a third victim of a plane crash , a @entity104 girl , has died from her injuries			0
she was among about a dozen injured still in hospital after @entity13 crashed as it approached the airport too low last week in an - online apology , @entity9 general manager @entity110 wrote : ' we sincerely regret the error and took immediate action to apologize , both in the newscast where the mistake occurred , as well as on our website and social media sites			1
nothing is more important to us than having the highest level of accuracy and integrity , and we are reviewing our procedures to ensure this type of error does not happen again			0
' two teenage girls from @entity104 and another unidentified passenger were killed and more than 180 people injured when the @entity129 clipped a sea wall and slammed into a runway saturday at @entity14			0
based in @entity134 , @entity135 , the @entity133 affiliate represents a city where 16.8 % of the population is @entity138			0
@entity9 also broadcasts in two heavily @entity138 - populated communities : @entity1 , where @entity140 make up 33.3 % of the total population and @entity142 , where 32 % of the population is @entity138			2
@entity9 ’s false report comes after a week of speculating whether last week 's disastrous @entity6 crash could be attributed to @entity146 ' culture ' and whether @entity148 ’s tradition of deference to hierarchy could have played a role in the crash			2
broken news : anchor @entity7 read the names off the teleprompter and did n't bat an eye , adding that the information had been confirmed by the @entity23 @entity6 has identified two of the four flying crew on board as the pilot and copilot @entity164 - kook and @entity165 - min. coverage of the tragic plane crash at @entity14 , which killed three people and injured dozens of others last saturday has proven tricky for some news outlets			1
earlier this week , the @entity171 apologized for its front page headline ' fright 214 , ' which was criticized for sounding like a stereotype of an @entity138 accent .			0

@entity176 broadcast inaccurate names but apologized for the error a few minutes later
@entity9 says it confirmed the information with the @entity23
@entity23 says a summer intern *verified* the names when approached by the station
