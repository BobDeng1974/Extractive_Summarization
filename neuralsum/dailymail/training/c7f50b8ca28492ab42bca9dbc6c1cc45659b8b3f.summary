earlier that year the tabloid had revealed that @entity19 had had an affair with the then @entity22 football coach			2
the claims appear to contradict evidence given by mr @entity5 , now a @entity26 - based talkshow host with @entity27 , to the @entity4 last year			1
mr @entity5 denied listening to miss @entity9 ’s voicemail messages to uncover the affair and said he did not believe phone hacking took place at the @entity16 while he was editor			1

the @entity3 anchorman was seated beside mr @entity5 with @entity19 , sir @entity40 and sir @entity44 , the @entity45 billionaire sitting nearby			1
mr @entity2 said : ‘ @entity5 said , teasing @entity9 , that he knew what had happened in the conversations between her and @entity11 and he went into this mock @entity49 accent			1
‘ now , i do n’t know whether he was repeating a conversation that he had heard or he was imagining this conversation			2
in fact , to be fair to him , i think we should accept both possibilities , because he probably was imagining it			0
it was a rather bad parody			0
’ @entity5 , former @entity16 and @entity58 editor , pictured giving evidence to the @entity4 in december 2011 via video link from the @entity61 @entity8 journalist @entity62 admitted at the @entity4 yesterday that an interview in which he asked former prime minister @entity64 if he was taking prescription painkillers was ' not a moment i look back on in my career with enormous enthusiasm or pride ' the veteran presenter said mr @entity5 ’s treatment of @entity19 was close to bullying			1
‘ i did n’t like it , ’ he said			0
mr @entity2 said mr @entity5 then explained to him intricate details of how the phone hacking scam was undertaken			1
he added : ‘ he turned to me and said , “ have you got a mobile phone ? ” , i said , “ yes ” , and he said , “ have you got a security setting on the message bit of it ? ” ‘ i do n’t think it was called voicemail in those days , i did n’t know what he was talking about			0
he then explained that the way to get access to people ’s messages was to go to the factory default setting and press either 0000 or 1234 and that if you did n’t put on your own code , in his words , “ you ’re a fool ”			0
’ mr @entity2 said : ‘ i do n’t know whether he was making this up , making up the conversation , but it was clearly something that he was familiar with and i was n’t			1
i did n’t know that this went on			0
’ last december , mr @entity5 told the @entity4 that he had little memory of the lunch and denied telling miss @entity9 to change the pin on her mobile phone			1
speaking via video link , he said he did not remember ‘ the specifics ’ and described claims that he had hacked miss @entity9 ’s voicemail as ‘ absolute nonsense ’			0

@entity114 said a ombudsman with statutory powers to resolve disputes between newspapers and complainants may be needed to ensure effective regulation of the press an ombudsman with statutory powers to resolve disputes between newspapers and complainants may be needed to ensure effective regulation of the press , @entity114 said yesterday			0
but he insisted that giving legal authority to an independent arbiter would not amount to state control of the @entity125			0
his comments came during exchanges with former conservative minister @entity131 at the inquiry into media standards and ethics			0
@entity114 told mr @entity131 that new statutes would be needed to make an ombudsman ’s decisions legally binding in disputes			2
‘ i ’ve not said the state should have a view of what is good practice , ’ he said			0
‘ i am not suggesting that the state should have any view on the content			0
’ but he added that ‘ the state should have a view on the mechanisms that are set up ’ to regulate the press			0
mr @entity131 , who as heritage secretary between 1994 and 1995 had responsibility for media policy , told the inquiry he was ‘ deeply sceptical ’ about the need for statutory regulation			2
he added that the government needed to be careful that by introducing legislation ‘ you do n’t create a cure that ’s worse than the disease ’			0
mr @entity131 said recent wrongdoing such as phone hacking was a failure of management not of regulation			2
he told the inquiry that the @entity167 had decided to ‘ do nothing ’ with the @entity170 report into press reforms , which proposed outlawing doorstepping of people in the news by reporters , bugging and long - lens photography			2
mr @entity131 said @entity178 ’s government decided that it would not be practical to implement the measures and that there was not a public appetite for the reforms			2
it much preferred self - regulation			2
mr @entity131 was shown a @entity1 comment piece from the time which criticised the @entity167 government ’s consideration of privacy legislation and press regulation			1
he said : ‘ @entity156 is a political organisation , and i was told early in my political life that any man can have friends but it takes a wise man to have the right enemies			0

mr @entity5 responded by *joking* : ' right - that *'s* the last time i *'m* inviting @entity2 to lunch . ungrateful little wretch . '
