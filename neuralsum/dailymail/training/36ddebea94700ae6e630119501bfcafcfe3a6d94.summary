an aggressive new strain of @entity1 has been identified , scientists have warned			1
a new study found the strain , called @entity5 , is capable of transforming from an infection to full - blown aids within just three years			1
that is considerably faster than the average conversion time of around 10 years - and can be so quick that a person may not even realise they are infected			1
scientists were prompted to investigate after noting a growing number of reports of people in @entity16 suffering a rapid progression to @entity18 , within three years of infection			1
experts say the new strain , identified in @entity16 , causes patients to progress to @entity18 within three years - so rapidly they may not even realise they have been infected			1
( image shows a mature hiv virus infection spreading inside the body ) @entity1 tests often do not detect the virus within the first few weeks of infection , sometimes months			2
once a person develops the flu - like symptoms that characterise acute infection - usually coming two to four weeks after infection - the virus undergoes a latency period			0
during that time the virus replicates and lives inside the body , but does not cause any symptoms			0
that period can last between five and 10 years before @entity18 develops , in most cases			1
but researchers at the @entity41 in @entity42 noted the @entity5 strain causes patients to make the transition to @entity18 much faster			1
it can be so quick that a person may not even realise they are infected			0
researcher professor @entity49 told @entity50 : ' @entity16 clinicians were asking us to collaborate with them to investigate why they were noticing an increase in patients progressing to @entity18 much faster than before			1
' we set up this project and found that a particular recombinant strain , called @entity5 , was strongly associated with fast progression			1
' all patients infected with @entity5 were progressing to @entity18 within three years after being infected - often as soon as they were diagnosed with hiv infection			1
' we know that they were infected just one or two years earlier , since we have an @entity1 negative test from the patients in the study one or two years earlier			1
' all these patients are offered treatment immediately , but some patients are at diagnosis so ill that they die before they can recover with treatment			2
' before the hiv virus can enter human cells , it has to attach itself to them			0
it does so via anchor points , which are proteins on the cell membrane - the coating of every cell that separates it from the outside environment			0
in a normal infection , the virus first attaches itself to the anchor point known as @entity84			0
a new study found the strain , called @entity5 , is capable of transforming from an infection to full - blown aids within just three years			1
that is considerably faster than the average conversion time of around 10 years but in many patients , after experiencing many healthy years during their latent period , the virus then switches to another anchor point , known as @entity96			1
it is that switch which tends to trigger a faster progression to @entity18			2
researchers at the @entity41 noted this new strain of the virus targets the second anchor point , @entity96 , early after infection			2
as a result the number of healthy years a patient experiences is drastically shortened , and a person will start to suffer the effects of @entity18 much faster			1
professor @entity49 , and an international team of scientists , studied the blood samples of 73 recently - infected patients			2
fifty - two already had @entity18 at diagnosis , while 21 had yet to see their infection move into the later , more serious stage			1
they compared these results with blood from 22 patients , who had progressed to @entity18 after a normal healthy period living with @entity1 , of around a decade			1
worldwide , more than 33 million people have @entity1			0
the human immunodeficiency virus ( @entity1 ) that causes @entity18 is spread via blood , semen and breast milk			1
there is no cure for the infection , but @entity18 can be kept at bay for many years with cocktails of antiretroviral drugs			2
the pandemic began more than 30 years ago and has killed up to 40 million people worldwide			0
but research published in july by the @entity134 showed @entity18 - related deaths worldwide dropped to 1.5 million last year , from 1.7 million the year before			2
that was the sharpest annual decline since the epidemic 's peak in 2004 and 2005 - and marked a 35 per cent drop from the 2.4 million deaths in both those years			0
new infections also fell to 2.1 million last year , down 38 per cent compared to the 3.4 million in 2001			0
but with more than half of the 35 million people with @entity1 unaware they are infected , the battle is far from over however , warned @entity146 , head of @entity147 - the @entity147			2
in those patients infected with the new strain of @entity1 , researchers found abnormally high doses of the virus , and of a defensive molecule known as rantes			1
the molecule is part of a person 's natural immune system response , and acts to join itself to @entity84 , to which most forms of @entity1 have to attach in order to enter the body 's cells			0
the high concentration of @entity154 suggests that most of the @entity84 were not available as anchor points for @entity1			0
this , the scientists believe , may have caused the virus to bypass that first anchor point , instead going straight to the second , @entity96			0
their finding that all study patients who were infected with the new @entity1 variant , went on to develop @entity18 within three years of infection supports the theory			1
professor @entity49 said while the strain was first noticed in @entity179 , it only appears to be spreading in @entity16 , where records so far show 144 infected			2
' since the study , we are aware of in total 144 patients being infected with this recombinant virus , probably much more , ' she said			0
' this recombinant virus originated in @entity179 but we are not aware that it is spreading there , we do see that it is spreading slowly in @entity16			2
' so far it has not been noticed elsewhere			0
' professor @entity49 , added : ' the worrying thing about this strain is that patients often get diagnosed with @entity1 infection and already have @entity18			1
' she said the majority of current treatments are equally effective against this new strain			0
one drug , though , which works by blocking the @entity84 anchor point , is not effective because the strain bypasses the anchor point			0
' there are however sufficient other options for those patients , as long as they start treatment early enough , ' she told @entity50			0
' so for patients infected with this aggressive @entity206 , it is key to get tested early in order to start treatment early			0
' that is in fact true for all hiv infections , but it is more crucial for this @entity5			0
' in general , it is essential for individuals engaging in risky behaviour to get tested often , so that they can start treatment as early as possible			0

new strain of @entity1 found spreading in @entity16 is known as @entity5
causes patients to progress to full - blown @entity18 within three years
the average @entity1 patient progresses to @entity18 in around 10 years
many patients with new strain found to have @entity18 at point of diagnosis
