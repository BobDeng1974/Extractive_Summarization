by @entity0 published : 10:17 est , 10 september 2012 updated : 13:46 est , 10 september 2012 the long - awaited unveiling of the @entity2 is just days away			1
in fact , @entity3 has spent the weekend preparing @entity6 â€™s @entity5 for the grand launch , which will see ceo @entity8 take to the stage to launch the first new iphone since the death of @entity12 last october			2
@entity3 stays quiet before the launches , but eagle - eyed @entity3 fans have already looked for cryptic clues in the colourful banner draped outside the building - and they appear to have found one			1
for when fans started playing around with the shrink tools on @entity20 , they saw that the multi-coloured strips are apparently the @entity2 's iconic deck of icons stretched upwards			1
ready for launch : the @entity25 in @entity6 has been given an @entity3 makeover - and the streaks of colour may give us a clue about the new @entity2 considering the rumours flying around @entity3 's latest device , it is not just the conspiracy theorists who see this as a clue that the next @entity2 will come with a bigger screen - for why else would the icons be stretched ? the images are on the front of the @entity42 , an apt location for @entity3 as it is often used for visual arts and media events			1
the cryptologists on the website @entity47 spotted how the banner took the form of @entity3 icons - in particular @entity52 , @entity53 , and the @entity54 - when you shrunk the image down			0
while sceptics might not see a hidden meaning in the image , it does appear a quite elongated and time - consuming process by @entity3 's pr team if it is one without purpose			0
spot the pattern ? the banner appears to show the music icon , the @entity67 , a @entity68 , a @entity70 program , an unknown , and then , at the end , the @entity73 logo stretch to fit : @entity3 has finished decorating the front facade of the @entity5 center before the event on wednesday the @entity2 has been the subject of heated debate over the last six months			1
@entity3 keeps notoriously tight - lipped about products until they are ready for launch , and the vacuum has been filled by plenty of speculation			0
however , reliable leaks from within the @entity3 supply chain have given away some of what we are likely to expect			0
this includes a re-designed dock port for connecting to other devices - which may infuriate users of older models - and a larger four - inch screen			0
@entity3 's iconic headphones are also getting their first redesign since 2008 , and the headphone socket has allegedly moved to the base of the device			0
unconfirmed but rumoured additions include an @entity101 chip , which allows swipeless payments at the till , and , following @entity3 's acquisition of a company called @entity105 , the possibility that ' swipe to unlock ' will become reality with an in - built fingerprint scanner .			2
