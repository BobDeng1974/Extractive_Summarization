by @entity0 published : 14:29 est , 7 february 2014 @entity2 : 15:51 est , 7 february 2014 homebuyers are being told to come clean about their spending on haircuts , bikini waxes , toiletries and the cost of feeding their pets - or risk being turned down for a mortgage			1
prying banks have started asking increasingly invasive questions of potential borrowers , quizzing them about their bills in every aspect of their lives			1
among the questions being asked are how much borrowers spend on personal grooming , dry cleaning , glasses , cleaning products and the size of their mobile phone bills			2
quiz : potential homebuyers are being asked increasingly invasive questions many of @entity31 ’s biggest banks already demand applicants give details of their monthly spending			1
but experts say the questions are likely to become even more probing ahead of tough new rules to be introduced by consumer watchdog the @entity39 in april			1
any applicant deemed to be extravagant will be penalised and in extreme cases refused a loan			2
last week , lender @entity43 unveiled the most detailed list spending questionnaire so far			1
it has 43 questions about borrowers ’ spending			1
they face having to comb through their bank statements to tot up splurges on meals out , visits to the dentist or the amount they fork out on contact lenses			0
on top of food and clothing costs , potential borrowers also have to give details of the spending on their car ’s annual @entity62 and reveal how much they typically pay to park their vehicle			0
they must also detail how much they set aside to cover personal grooming			1
implications : requests for as mortgage could be judged on how much you spend on pet food this could include the cost of trips to a hairdresser or regular visits to a bikini waxing salon			0
extras such as cinema or theatre trips are also weighed up by the lender			0
banks will then check these spending habits against their monthly statements to check their spending habits			1
risky behaviour ? a trip to the cinema could determine whether or not you can buy your dream home so if a bank sees you make regular visits to a beauty parlour , waxing salon or hairdresser , it could restrict the amount it lends you			1
@entity102 , chief executive of campaign group the @entity103 , said : ‘ this is outrageous			0
it is like treating people like children who have no control over their spending			1
‘ banks and building societies already have access to our credit records in order to decide how much to lend to us			1
‘ i really do n’t see what they have to gain by finding out how many chocolate bars someone eats a month or how much they spend on colouring their hair			0
it could also spark quite a few rows between couples who have tried to keep the full details of their spending private			0
’ @entity129 , founder of moneysaving website @entity130 , said : ‘ i ca n’t see any circumstances where a mortgage company would need to break down your spending in such detail			1
‘ why on earth would they need to know you spend more on trips to the cinema than on highlights ? ’ experts say big banks and building societies are racing to produce their own detailed questionnaires before the new lending rules kick in			1
@entity148 is asking mortgage applicants to describe their spending in dozens of areas			0
these include the cost of their pooch but also phone and internet bills and spending on food and drink			0
two years ago the @entity159 revealed how @entity160 sparked outrage after demanding customers tell it how much they spend on celebrations such as birthdays and religious festivals			1
mortgage brokers say an increasing trend is for banks to grill borrowers about their spending on their pets , including vets bills			2
insurance premiums and trips to the grooming parlour			0
gym contracts and holidays have also come under the spotlight			0
@entity180 , associate director of mortgage broker @entity181 and @entity183 said : ‘ the danger is that firms are asking for too much detail and people just wo n’t know what they spend			2
‘ for example , you may have a rough idea about what your car costs in petrol and insurance - but there are other costs too			2
credit : critics have said that banks already have access to enough information to judge whether people should be lent money ‘ there is no problem with the gist of the rules - but when you ask for too much detail it ’s unwieldy for customers			1
‘ if you ’re thinking about getting a mortgage you need to think about exactly where you spend your money			0
’ in april , the @entity39 will bring in new rules based on its @entity216			0
these will mean banks and building societies are fully responsible for checking a borrower can properly afford a mortgage before giving them the cash			2
if they are deemed to be lending irresponsibly they face big fines			0
and they will also have to give borrowers ’ finances a stress test , to ensure they can cope with a rise in repayments caused by an increase in mortgage rates			0
experts fear other banks will also soon by toughening their rules			2
@entity236 , product manager at mortgage broker @entity237 , says : ‘ it stands to reason that if one mortgage company does this , then others will be hot on their heels			0
‘ lenders are likely to ask even more detailed questions over the next few months as the new rules kick in			0
’ @entity245 , a spokesman for @entity43 says : ‘ we are one of the first lenders to communicate what we are looking for in borrowers under the mortgage market review			1
' we will not ask these questions in every case but on occasion we will ask for extra detail in terms of an applicant ’s income and expenditure			2

banks demand ever more information before granting home loans
last week @entity43 introduced 43 - part questionnaire
critics say demanding such detail is treating homebuyers ' like children '
