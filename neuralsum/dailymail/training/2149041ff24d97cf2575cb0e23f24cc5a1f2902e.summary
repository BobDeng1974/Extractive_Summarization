@entity0 is attempting to opt out of a @entity2 initiative allowing people to easily remove their details from online service providers such as @entity6			0
the controversial move has caused uproar among privacy campaigners , who today accused the government of blocking an ' essential move ' the rule , known as the ' right to be forgotten ' has been developed by the @entity15 justice commissioners in the face of growing complaints about the way @entity6 and other social media giants retain information			1
the @entity0 government is locked in a battle with @entity23 , @entity24 and @entity25 , over the rules governing how social networks delete data introducing the plans , @entity23 , the @entity15 justice commissioner , said they are : ' a comprehensive set of existing and new rules to better cope with privacy risks online			1
' when modernising the legislation , i want to explicitly clarify that people shall have the right – and not only the ' possibility ' – to withdraw their consent to data processing			1
' the burden of proof should be on data controllers – those who process your personal data			1
' they must prove that they need to keep the data rather than individuals having to prove that collecting their data is not necessary			1
' in its current form , which is not finalised , article 17 of the @entity55 provides for punitive fines – up to 2 % of global turnover – for companies that refuse to comply with requests to erase customers ' personal details			0
@entity62 , director of privacy and civil liberties group @entity64 , said : ' the right to be forgotten is a political sound bite that got out of control , but the idea behind it is an essential move			1
' it ’s absolutely right that for companies who do not legally need to keep data , if you leave a service you should be able to delete your data wherever it appears across that service			2
' this change gives citizens that right			0
' @entity0 's objection to the @entity15 move is that unrealistic expectations will be created by the right 's expansive title because the controls proposed will be relatively modest in their impact on the way data spreads , or is traded , across websites			1
mr @entity62 agreed with these concerns , but called for the bill to be saved			0
' there are fair concerns about who is responsible for tracking down and deleting information if it has appeared on other services , but that is no reason to junk the whole proposal			2
' equally , it is critical that @entity0 citizens do not have weaker rights than people in other countries when we are dealing with international services			0
' that creates needless complexity for individuals and businesses so i hope the detail can be worked out to ensure proper protections that are feasible and will not cripple small businesses			0
” @entity23 , the @entity15 justice commissioner , said : ' at present a citizen can request deletion only if data is incomplete or incorrect			1
the rules were proposed following a slew of complaints against sites such as @entity124 's ( pictured ) @entity6 ' we want to extend this right to make it stronger in this internet world			2
the burden of proof shall be on the companies , they will have to show that data is needed			2
' she described the legislation as ' one of the biggest market - openers of the last few years			0
' the @entity137 said : ' the @entity138 does not support the right to be forgotten as proposed by the @entity2 commission			2
the title raises unrealistic and unfair expectations of the proposals			0
' we are also concerned about potentially impossible requirements for data controllers to manage third - party erasure ; the " reasonable steps " required by the draft regulation would promise much , but deliver little			0
