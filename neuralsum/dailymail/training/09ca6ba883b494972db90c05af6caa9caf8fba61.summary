the rodent , his cheeks full to bursting , ensure he stuffed as many peanuts as possible into his mouth before heading home			2
he was caught in his act of gluttony by @entity13 , a @entity14 photographer , as he fed them whilst he sat in his back garden in @entity17 , @entity14			1
what you looking at ? the cheeky chipmunk was quite content stuffing as many nuts into its mouth as it could manage who goes there ? @entity13 regularly feeds the chipmunks outside his home in @entity28 , @entity14 all mine : mr @entity13 said that they all come withing a few centimetre of him , regularly taking peanuts from his hand ' i regularly sit outside and feed the chipmunks , and have done for years now , ' said mr @entity13 , 48			1
' they have come to trust that i am not a threat , and they are comfortable when they approach me for food			2
' they come within a few centimetres of me , regularly taking peanuts from my hand			0
' they even climb on me from time to time , when they get impatient of waiting for me to hand over the food			2
' i would have to say the chipmunks are pretty pleased with the easy food supply			1
' saving it for later ? the chipmunk did not seem too interested in the food on offer to begin with , before changing its tune depending on the chipmunk , according to mr @entity13 , they usually take two or three before returning to unload their stash greedy : rather than wait to go underground , this one was clearly unfussy and was happy to dig in in front of the photographer the rodents tend to store non-perishables to help combat the harsh @entity14 winters chipmunks gather food to feed their families and to store non-perishable foods so they are prepared for the @entity14 winters , which last between six to eight months			1
luckily for these small creatures they can make light work of their food gathering thanks to their handy cheek pouches , enabling them to carry multiple nuts			0
' depending on the chipmunk , they would take either two or three before returning to the burrow to unload , ' said mr @entity13			1
' generally speaking , they do n't eat many of the nuts above ground			0
they dine in the evening underground , where it is safe			0
' people seem to really enjoy the images of the chipmunks , the antics of these little critters are well known			0
