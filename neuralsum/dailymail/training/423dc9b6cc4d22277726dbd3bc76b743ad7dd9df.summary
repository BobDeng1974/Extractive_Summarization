by @entity0 , @entity1 correspondent the public has lost faith in government claims about tackling immigration because it does not tally with what they see on the ground , @entity2 will admit			1
in a speech on immigration tomorrow , the deputy prime minister will say it is ‘ no wonder ’ that people do not believe what ministers tell them when they have been ‘ repeatedly told one thing only to then see another ’			1
he will speak out in favour of the free movement of @entity22 citizens but seek reforms to ensure that fewer eastern @entity22 move here if more countries are admitted to the @entity26 in future			1
speaking out : in a speech on immigration , @entity2 ( left ) will back the seek reforms to the free movement of @entity22 citizens to ensure that fewer eastern @entity22 move here if more countries are admitted to the @entity26 in future , while @entity34 ( right ) will also call for reforms to tackle benefit tourism @entity37 ’s welfare spokesman @entity34 will also call for reforms to the freedom of movement – to tackle benefit tourism – in a speech tomorrow			1
but the @entity43 claim her idea – to stop people being able to claim welfare unless they have built up sufficient national insurance contributions – was likely to be illegal under @entity26 law			2
the two speeches on immigration from @entity37 and @entity52 politicians indicate that both believe they need to speak tough on the issue in the run - up to next may ’s general election			2
on saturday , @entity37 ’s @entity57 said the party could not win the election unless it became tougher on immigration			2
the surge by @entity62 – which stands on an anti-immigration platform – in may ’s @entity22 elections particularly unnerved the @entity52 , who were reduced to one seat			0
to tackle this perception , mr @entity2 will say tomorrow that more needs to be done on migration from @entity22			1
arrivals : passengers check in for a flight from @entity73 , @entity74 , to @entity75 , on january 1 this year when transition controls were lifted ‘ i want to be unequivocal : freedom of movement between @entity26 member states is a good thing , ’ he will say			1
‘ it ’s a cornerstone of @entity22 integration ; a right enjoyed by around one and a half million @entity86 citizens who live on the other side of the @entity88			2
‘ it is necessary in order to be part of the world ’s biggest single market where goods and people can flow between nations			0
‘ those who wish to undo it should be careful what they wish for : the blow to @entity86 prosperity would be immense			0
’ but he said freedom of movement needed reform to make it clear it was a freedom to work , not a freedom to claim benefits			0
he said that , if the @entity26 expands in future , there need to be tougher transitional controls so that fewer people from poorer countries can come here in search of work			1
mr @entity2 will say : ‘ in 2004 @entity37 said up to 13,000 people from countries like @entity120 and @entity121 would come here every year			1
the real figure was around 170,000			0
‘ when @entity74 and @entity123 joined , @entity37 said no one from those countries would arrive ahead of the transition controls being lifted this year			2
yet 60,000 @entity74 and @entity123 were already working here through a loophole for anyone who registered as self - employed			0
‘ is it any wonder – when people have been repeatedly told one thing only to then see another – that so many have lost faith in government ’s ability to manage the flow of migrants from new @entity26 states ? ’ get tough : @entity141 will warn @entity142 that @entity143 will only give him a better deal if he threatens to pull @entity86 out of the @entity26 @entity141 will throw down the gauntlet to @entity142 this week – by warning that @entity143 will only give him a better deal if he threatens to pull @entity86 out of the @entity26			1
a study by the @entity75 mayor ’s economic adviser , banker @entity150 , says leaving the @entity26 is ‘ definitely a viable option ’ and would be better for @entity86 than staying in an unreformed institution			0
mr @entity141 will use the findings in a speech in which he is expected to say that the @entity86 should ‘ not be frightened ’ of leaving the @entity26 – a stark contrast to the position of the prime minister , who wants @entity86 to stay in			1
mr @entity142 has pledged a referendum on @entity26 membership by 2017 , following @entity143 reforms , including a crackdown on benefit tourism			0
but mr @entity141 is understood to believe that the strategy will not ensure success			0
a source close to the mayor told @entity167 that he believes mr @entity142 must be ‘ bold ’ in his demands in the renegotiation of membership and the best way is by showing he has ‘ no fear ’ of departure if the talks fail to deliver .			0
