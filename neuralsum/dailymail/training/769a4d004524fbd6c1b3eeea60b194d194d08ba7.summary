by @entity0 published : 14:24 est , 16 september 2013 updated : 07:48 est , 17 september 2013 this incredible photo shows radio signals glowing blue from the spacecraft @entity5 nearly 12 billion miles away			1
scientists ca n't actually see the spacecraft but they can detect its radio light			1
they used the @entity9 ( @entity9 ) a network of powerful radio telescopes to pick up the signal which looks like a blue speck			1
it is believed this image was taken on february 21 this year			0
@entity16 , @entity5 's project manager at @entity18 's @entity17 in @entity19 , @entity20 , said : ' this image represents the @entity5 radio signal as seen by the world 's most sensitive ground - based telescope			1
outer space : the @entity9 ( @entity9 ) , a network of radio telescopes operated by the @entity29 , spotted the signal of @entity18 's @entity5 spacecraft from 11.5 billion miles away ' it 's just a speck in amongst a sea of darkness			1
' earlier today a sound recording was sent back to @entity37 from the spacecraft as it crossed a new frontier becoming the first spacecraft to ever leave the solar system			1
the rising tones @entity18 observed are made by the vibration of dense plasma or ionised gas and were captured by the probe 's plasma wave instrument			0
speaking in a news conference , @entity49 , principle investigator for the @entity5 plasma wave investigation , said : ' when you hear this recording , please recognise that this is an historic event			2
it 's the first time that we 've ever made a recording of sounds in interstellar space			2
the space agency announced today that @entity5 has become the first spacecraft to enter interstellar space , or the space between stars @entity5 's current mission , along with @entity69 , is to explore the outermost edge of the @entity72 's domain and beyond @entity18 officials added : ' there were two times the instrument heard these vibrations : october to november 2012 and april to may 2013			1
' scientists noticed that each occurrence involved a rising tone			0
the dashed line indicates that the rising tones follow the same slope			0
this means a continuously increasing density			0
' a team still stays in contact with the two @entity5 spacecraft every day but @entity5 's extreme distance , currently around 12 billion miles from @entity37 , means a message takes 17 hours to reach us			2
thirty - six years after it was launched from @entity37 on a tour of the outer planets , the plutonium - powered probe is more than 11 1/2 billion miles from the sun , cruising through what scientists call interstellar space — the vast , cold emptiness between the stars , the space agency said			1
@entity5 actually made its exit more than a year ago , according to @entity18			1
but it 's not as if there 's a dotted boundary line out there or a signpost , and it was not until recently that the space agency had the evidence to convince it of what an outside research team had claimed last month : that the spacecraft had finally plowed through the hot plasma bubble surrounding the planets and escaped the sun 's influence			2
while some scientists said they remain unconvinced , @entity18 celebrated			0
' it 's a milestone and the beginning of a new journey , ' said mission chief scientist @entity123 at @entity18 's @entity17 in @entity19			0
@entity5 will now study exotic particles and other phenomena in a never - before - explored part of the universe and radio the data back to @entity37 , where the voyager team awaits the starship 's discoveries			1
the interstellar ambassador also carries a gold - plated disc containing multicultural greetings , songs and photos , just in case it bumps into an intelligent species			0
this artist 's concept shows @entity18 's two @entity5 spacecraft exploring a turbulent region of space known as the heliosheath , the outer shell of the bubble of charged particles around our sun it is 36 years since the twin @entity5 and 2 spacecraft were launched and the pair continue to explore where nothing from @entity37 has flown before			1
their primary mission was the exploration of @entity159 and @entity160			0
after making a string of discoveries there -- such as active volcanoes on @entity165 and intricacies of @entity160 's rings -- the mission was extended			0
@entity69 went on to explore @entity169 and @entity170 , and is still the only spacecraft to have visited those outer planets			2
the current mission for both spacecraft , the @entity173 , is to explore the outermost edge of the @entity72 's domain and beyond			2
@entity5 's odyssey began in 1977 when the spacecraft and its twin , @entity69 , were launched on a tour of the gas giant planets of the solar system			1
after beaming back dazzling postcard views of @entity159 's giant red spot and @entity160 's shimmering rings , @entity69 hopscotched to @entity169 and @entity170			0
meanwhile , @entity5 used @entity160 as a gravitational slingshot to power itself past @entity188			2
@entity5 , which is about the size of a subcompact car , carries instruments that study magnetic fields , cosmic rays and solar wind			2
last year , scientists monitoring @entity5 noticed strange happenings that suggested the spacecraft had broken through : charged particles streaming from the sun suddenly vanished			1
at the same time , there was a spike in galactic cosmic rays bursting in from the outside			0
since there was no detectable change in the direction of the magnetic field lines , the team assumed the far - flung craft was still in the heliosphere , or the vast bubble of charged particles around the sun @entity5 is bathed in solar wind from the southern hemisphere flowing northward the voyager team patiently waited for a change in magnetic field direction — thought to be the telltale sign of a cosmic border crossing			1
but in the meantime , a chance solar eruption caused the space around @entity5 to echo like a bell last spring and provided the scientists with the data they needed , convincing them the boundary had been crossed in august of last year			1
' it took us 10 seconds to realize we were in interstellar space , ' said @entity49 , a @entity5 scientist at the @entity231 who led the new research , published online in the journal @entity234			1
the new observations are fascinating , but ' it 's premature to judge , ' said @entity237 , a space science professor at the @entity239 and former @entity18 associate administrator who was not part of the team			0
' can we wait a little while longer ? maybe this picture will clear up the farther we go			0
' voyager 1 is capable of returning scientific data from a full range of instruments , with adequate electrical power and attitude control propellant to keep operating until 2020			2
what bothers @entity237 is the absence of a change in magnetic field direction			0
@entity255 astrophysicist @entity254 was more blunt : ' i 'm actually not going to believe it for another year or two until it 's been solidly outside for a while			0
' while @entity5 may have left the solar system as most people understand it , it still has thousands of years to go before bidding adieu to the last icy bodies that make up our neighborhood			1
@entity69 trails behind at 9 1/2 billion miles from the sun. it may take another three years before @entity69 joins its twin on the other side			0
eventually , the @entity269 will run out of nuclear fuel and will have to power down their instruments , perhaps by 2025			0
this artist 's impression shows how plasma flows around @entity18 's @entity5 spacecraft as it gets close to entering interstellar space			1

@entity5 was launched in 1977 and has now left our solar system
scientists ca n't see the spacecraft but they can detect its radio light
powerful radio telescopes picked up the signal which looks like a blue speck
scientists claim @entity5 entered interstellar space more than a year ago
study claims @entity5 left heliosphere around august 25 , 2012
voyager 1 is now the first mission to explore interstellar space
