he wrote : ' i own ... seventy - five pairs of boots , forty - one pairs of leather pants , thirty - two pairs of haute couture jeans , ten evening jackets , and 115 pairs of leather gloves			2
' i have an addiction			2
it is n't drugs or gambling : i get to keep what i use after i use it			0
' but there are similarities : the futile feeding of the bottomless beast and the unavoidable psychological implications , the immediate hit of the new that feels like an orgasm and the inevitable coming - down			0
' red - y or not ! a stunning red leather jacket by @entity112 will also be on the auction block a head of the pack ! this @entity117 jacket has a skull , fur , and fewer than 50 shades of grey leather mr @entity2 , who describes @entity16 as his main ' compulsion , ' said the most expensive leather jacket he owns cost $ 13,900 , which was bought from @entity16 and is made of ostrich skin			1

regardless , he considers the article his ‘ way of bottoming out and knowing that i needed in - treatment help			0
i could no longer continue the way i was living			0
’ he checked into rehab days after the article was published - and revealed what it was like in an interview with @entity144 earlier this year			0
' i think everybody should go to rehab , ' he said			0
' it ’s called rehab , but it ’s 60 days of stepping out of your life and thinking very hard and working , because you ’re seeing therapists basically 12 hours a day			0
' making positive changes ! mr @entity2 at the @entity6 premiere in october 2004 - before his clothing choices got more ambitious mr @entity2 has since put all his clothing in to a climate - controlled storage facility , which is where @entity18 's founder went to retrieve it			1

it looks like the mob just stole a truck from @entity16 and @entity165 and @entity166			0
’ mr @entity2 admitted ‘ i really do have a lot of clothing , if anyone wants in			1
’ while mr @entity2 says that he no longer searches for himself on @entity172 or @entity173 , he has made a promise to journalists who are nice to him in their future coverage of his life			1
