by @entity0 published : 12:37 est , 6 june 2013 updated : 11:26 est , 7 june 2013 an @entity2 on the @entity4 coast has been dubbed @entity6 's most dangerous street amid fears one house after the other is collapsing into the sea			1
the sprawling 90 - year - old houses in @entity12 , @entity13 , have been rocked by a series of devastating landslides which saw one home fall over the cliff edge and others evacuated over safety fears			1
coastal erosion has meant that the once - elegant family homes are at risk of falling down , with one evacuated by @entity23 and the garden of another fenced off because it is judged at risk of falling 150ft into the waves below			1
but over the last few months , landslides have turned one home into a heap of bricks and wood dangling over the cliff edge , while a neighbouring house has been deemed too risky to live in			1
the street has become so notorious , it is attracting crowds of tourists - many just children - curious to see the cul - de - sac that is falling into the sea			1
@entity23 has now warned sightseers to stay away , for their own safety , and asked residents to work together to keep the gawkers out			1
a spokesman said : ' following the recent collapse of a property and ongoing concerns about cliff stability we are taking steps to ensure public safety			2
' this includes requiring owners of properties at the seaward end of @entity12 to take appropriate measures to prevent access to adjoining land approaching the cliffs			2
the cliff - side view of the house that tumbled 150ft down to the sea - @entity23 fear the rest of the houses are in danger of following suit dangerous ruins : @entity83 , in @entity13 's @entity12 , collapsed and crumbled into the sea earlier this year because of coastal erosion ' we would strongly advise parents to ensure their children do not go on to the private land and put their safety at risk			1
' a total of 100,000 tonnes of earth have come crashing down from @entity95 's crumbling cliffs in recent months			2
the first house to fall victim was sprawling @entity83 , which has now almost completely disappeared over the edge			2
the mangled mansion became infamous because it was declared unsafe just one week after being sold at a blind auction			0
the six - bedroom pile was bought for Â £ 155,000 in february 2010 via a telephone bid by a woman from @entity104 who had never been there			2
police officers in @entity4 and @entity106 say the influx of sightseers is not only dangerous , but adding to the anguish of those still living in the street 's 16 remaining homes			1
such is the street 's notoriety , crowds of sightseers , many of them children , have flocked to the @entity2 to see the houses still at risk police say sightseers are putting their own safety at risk by visiting the crumbling clifftop street police constable @entity123 warned : ' lots of youngsters are gaining access which will undoubtedly end fatally if we do n't stop it			1
you can clearly see that one slip on the uneven ground will most certainly lead to your death			0
' please keep out if you do n't want to die			0
' @entity134 @entity133 added : ' we just do n't want a group of drunk kids going in their at night			0
' the gardens have been totally undermined			0
one wrong foot in the dark and you 're gone			0
i 'm no geologist , but it looks as if there will be more movement			0
' the houses in @entity12 were built 90 years ago so residents could enjoy far - reaching views across the @entity42 the green south @entity4 coastline has been blighted by the recent landslips that have devastated the large houses above this handsome house at the end of the once - desirable cul - de - sac is next to @entity83 and thought to be at serious risk of further landslips @entity23 is to replace the ' road closed ' sign at the seaward end of the street with a permanent metal barrier			1
local councillor @entity162 said : ' we have been meeting with residents and they have been issued with a letter about our intentions			0
' for safety reasons , we can not have people wandering up there looking around			0
' we have to protect people who live there and make sure that onlookers do n't keep going up there			0
it is a nightmare for them and we have to put this to bed once and for all			0

one house in @entity12 , @entity13 , has already crumbled and fallen 150ft into the sea below after landslides
@entity23 officers fear more houses in the once - desirable street will follow suit as coastal erosion continues
the street 's notoriety is attracting crowds of sightseers keen to see the houses *teetering* on the cliff edge
