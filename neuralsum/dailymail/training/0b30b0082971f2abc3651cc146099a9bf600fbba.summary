by @entity0 published : 03:59 est , 17 december 2013 updated : 05:22 est , 17 december 2013 good friends like @entity2 and @entity3 got more credit for their contrary ways and trend - setting ideas , but it was @entity8 who set the precedent for change in country music more than a decade earlier			1
@entity8 passed away monday at his @entity13 home , having long outlasted most of his country music contemporaries and the prognosis doctors gave him when they discovered his pancreatic cancer in 2011			1
the way the @entity19 member fought cancer was an apt metaphor for the way he lived his life , always fiercely charting a path few others might have the fortitude to follow			2
' @entity8 was a giant in @entity13 and country western music			1
besides one of the greatest voices that ever sang a note , @entity8 's career spanned over 65 years in a business where 25 years would be amazing , ' said @entity52 of the country music group @entity53			1
@entity8 , one of country music 's most popular and influential singers and bandleaders , had more than 100 hits and was one of the last living connections to @entity34 , who was @entity8 's roommate and drinking partner			1
@entity19 historian @entity61 said @entity8 ' was one of his generation 's most important musical innovators , ' popularizing the bedrock 4/4 shuffle beat that can still be heard on every honky - tonk jukebox and most country radio stations in the world			1
long career : during his six decades of producing music @entity8 , pictured here 50 years apart in 1957 and 2007 , had seven @entity73 no. 1 hits and made the country music charts more than 100 times ' his emphasis on the shuffle rhythm influenced every generation to follow and remains a staple of country dance floors everywhere , especially in the @entity81 , ' said @entity61			1
@entity8 died monday afternoon at his ranch outside @entity83 , @entity13 , said @entity84 , who was acting as a family spokesman			1
@entity8 's cancer had recently spread to his liver , intestines and lungs , according @entity90 in @entity91			1
he stopped aggressive treatments and left the hospital last thursday to receive hospice care at home			0
at the time his wife @entity96 , relayed what she called her husband 's ' final message ' to his fans : ' i love my fans and have devoted my life to reaching out to them			1
' i appreciate their support all these years , and i hope i have n't let them down			0
i 'm going to be just fine			0
do n't worry about me			0
i 'll see you again one day			0
' perhaps best known for his version of the @entity113 song for @entity114 , a pop hit in 1970 , the velvet - voiced @entity8 was a giant among traditional country performers in the 1950s , 60s and 70s , as likely to defy a trend as he was to defend one			1
he helped invent the genre 's honky - tonk sound early in his career , then took it in a more polished direction			0
@entity8 ( far right ) was a pioneer of his genre , introducing the 4/4 rhythm - heavy shuffle to country on his track @entity128 which is used by artists to this day he reached the @entity131 eight times from 1958 - 73 and had seven no. 1 hits and more than 100 titles on the @entity73 country chart from 1952 to 1989			1

his other country hits included @entity128 , @entity138 , @entity139 , @entity140 and @entity141			1
@entity8 was elected to the @entity19 in 1996 , long after he had become dissatisfied with @entity142 and returned to his home state of @entity13			1
his importance went well beyond hit singles			0
he was among the pioneers who popularized electric instruments and drums in country music			0
after helping establish the 4/4 shuffle in country music , @entity8 angered traditionalists by breaking away from country			1
he gave early breaks to @entity2 , @entity155 and other major performers			0
his @entity157 in the late 1960s was a heavily orchestrated version that crossed over to the pop charts			0
he then started touring with a string - laden 20 - piece band that outraged his dancehall fans			2
in the 1970s he sang often with symphony orchestras - in a tuxedo and cowboy boots			0
like @entity2 , his good friend and contemporary , @entity8 simply did n't care what others thought and pursued the chance to make his music the way he wanted to			2
' i have fought prejudice since i got in country music and i will continue to fight it , ' he said in 1981			0
' a lot of people want to keep country music in the minority of people			0
but it belongs to the world			0

the trio performed on tour with the @entity13 swing band @entity53			2
' i 'll be surprised if we do n't all get locked up somewhere , ' @entity8 joked at the time			2
over the years , @entity8 came in and out of vogue as traditional country music waxed and waned on the radio			1
he was a constant advocate for the old days and ways of country music , and more recently re-entered the news when he took offense to comments @entity224 made about classic country music that included the words ' old farts			2
' the dust - up drew attention on the @entity230 and introduced @entity8 to a new generation of country fans			1
' you should be so lucky as us old - timers , ' @entity8 said in a happily cantankerous post in all capital letters			2
' check back in 63 years ( the year 2075 ) and let us know how your name and your music will be remembered			0
