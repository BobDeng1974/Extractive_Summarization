by @entity0 eight million people in the @entity3 are at high risk of heart disease and diabetes even though they have a ' healthy ' body mass index , experts have said			1
people of @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity13 descent are up to six times more likely to suffer from type 2 diabetes , heart disease and stroke			1
this is according to the @entity19 ( @entity19 ) , in a briefing to the local authorities that plan health campaigns			2
people of @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity13 descent are up to six times more likely to suffer from type 2 diabetes , heart disease and stroke - and a @entity8 of 23 should ring alarm bells , experts say it said a lower @entity8 of 23 - typically classed as in the ' healthy ' range of 18 to 25 - must be used as a trigger for action in helping those from these backgrounds avoid ill health			1
professor @entity35 , director of the centre for public health at @entity19 , said : ' type 2 diabetes , heart disease and stroke are potentially life - threatening conditions , which people of @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity13 descent and other minority ethnicities are significantly more likely to develop than the wider population			1
the most widely used way to measure an adult 's weight is to calculate body mass index ( @entity8 )			2
this is your weight in kilograms divided by your height in metres squared			0
a ' healthy ' @entity8 is classed as between 18 and 25			1
if your @entity8 is between 25 and 29.9 , you are over the ideal weight for your height ( overweight )			2
if your @entity8 is between 30 and 39.9 , you are obese			2
if your @entity8 is over 40 , you are very obese ( known as ‘ morbidly obese ’ )			0
' so it 's vital that local authorities are supported in taking action to prevent these illnesses in people who have a high risk of developing them			0
' not only are people from these ethnic backgrounds up to six times more likely to be diagnosed with type 2 diabetes , they are 50 % more likely to die from cardiovascular disease , and they also suffer from these conditions at a younger age			1
' this briefing recommends that a @entity8 of 23 should be the threshold to trigger action to prevent these chronic conditions in people of @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity13 descent and other minority ethnicities , as these individuals are at an increased risk at what is normally considered a healthy weight			1
' in our diverse population , it 's essential that decision makers , practitioners and individuals are aware of this difference , as it 's lower than the 25 @entity8 value routinely used to signal an increased risk of chronic illness			2
' critics have previously argued that @entity8 is an insensitive measure of obesity , prone to underestimating obesity in women in particular			0
critics have previously argued that @entity8 is an insensitive measure of obesity , prone to underestimating obesity in women in particular two years ago dr @entity97 , of @entity98 , and dr @entity99 , the @entity100 health commissioner , found that @entity8 drastically underestimated how many people should regard themselves as unhealthily overweight or obese			1
in addition , the likelihood of error increased as they got older			0
fifty - nine per cent more women aged 70 or over were classified as obese when measured with a @entity107 scan than their @entity8 suggested			0
researchers said this was because women lost more muscle to fat than men as they age			0
as @entity8 does not distinguish between muscle and fat , it does n’t pick up on the change , dr @entity97 said			0
he added that @entity8 should be called the ‘ baloney mass index ’ because it was so inaccurate .			0

people of @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity13 descent are up to six times more likely to suffer from type 2 diabetes , heart disease and stroke
these people should take steps to avoid ill health when their @entity8 hits 23
@entity19 : for these people , there is no such thing as a ' healthy ' reading of 25
