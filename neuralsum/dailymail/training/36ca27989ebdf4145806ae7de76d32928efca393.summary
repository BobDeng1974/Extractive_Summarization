by @entity0 a 63 - year - old man has been given his wife 's blessing to sleep with a cougar – the 15 - stone mountain lion he cuddles up to every night and refers to as his ' 200lb daughter '			1
@entity7 adopted his unusual pet @entity9 when she was just a kitten and says she now sees him as her ' mother '			1
his wife @entity12 , 53 , completely supports his close relationship with the huge animal , which lives in and around their home in @entity17 , @entity18			1
she 's the love of my life , she 's like my 200lb daughter			2
i would do anything for her			0
' the professional jazz guitarist had wanted to own a big cat since watching @entity44 as a child and moved to @entity18 specifically to enjoy its relaxed laws on owning dangerous creatures			2
he bottle - raised @entity9 as a newborn and he or his wife have been by her side 24 hours a day ever since			1
at first she slept in the couple 's bed with them but was soon too big to fit and had began to maul and chew it			2
the couple then built a 3,000 - square - foot habitat for her to live in , with access to a swimming pool , toys and trees			1
@entity9 is also allowed into the house and enjoys nothing more than curling up on her adopted parent mr @entity7 as he watches tv			1
mr @entity7 has cared for @entity9 since she was a kitten ( right ) and gives her full access to his home in @entity18 @entity9 as a three - week - old cub			1
mr @entity7 has since spent £ 70,000 looking after her the lion enjoys watching tv with mr @entity7 and pines for him when he is away , his wife says when her husband is away , mrs @entity71 holds up the telephone so pet lion @entity9 can hear his voice the ' @entity76 ' , who also owns a @entity78 lynx , knows never to turn his back on @entity9 - who he estimates is four times stronger than him			1
he said : ' i do n't think she 'll rip anybody 's face off			0
she 's not that kind of an aggressive cat			0
' the only time she gets a little dangerous is when she gets over-playful or over-affectionate			0
i have a little scar on my lower leg but it 's nothing			0
you could hardly notice it			0
' mr @entity7 carries a bottle of spirit vinegar for self - defence in case @entity9 ever turns on him , as cougars can not stand the smell of the liquid			1
he added : ' i have never had a problem with @entity9			2
the only time i had trouble ( with animals ) was when i was training to get my license			0
' i got into a little tussle with a 350lb tiger that i basically brought up			0
she wanted to play rough and i didn't.the main thing is to show no fear			0
' animal - lover mr @entity7 , who also has a @entity78 lynx , moved to @entity18 to enjoy their relaxed laws on the keeping of dangerous pets he says @entity9 , pictured here when she was just three days old , now treats him like a mother despite their closeness , mr @entity7 says he still has to make sure never to turn his back on the lion , which he says is four times stronger than him cougars in captivity live 25 - 30 years compared with seven to 10 years in the wild			1
so with @entity9 only just turning 14 , the unusual family are looking forward to spending more time together			2
despite their happiness , @entity7 and mrs @entity71 have had to make plenty of sacrifices to have her - including not having children of their own			1
they have also spent more than $ 118,000 on her upkeep - including $ 33,700 on the custom - made habitat			0
although she is younger than her husband , mrs @entity71 says she has often received jokes about being mr @entity7 's second cougar , a term used to describe women who go after younger men			1
she said : ' it is quite expensive to feed her but we look at her as one of children			0
the couple say they have had to make a number of sacrifices for @entity9 , including not having children of their own he thinks @entity9 is better off in the safety and comfort of her enclosure at his home , rather than at risk in the wild he has designed a 3,000 - square - foot habitat for the animal outside his home ' so what we feed them would be money we would have otherwise put aside for a college education			1
' mrs @entity71 has also been trained to handle @entity9 and is often left to feed her meat at dusk - her preferred feeding time - while mr @entity7 is playing gigs			1
she added : ' when he goes she 'll constantly look at the window and meow for him			0
i 'll go out there to feed her and she 'll look past me and look like , " okay where 's daddy ? " ' when he is on tour he 'll call every night and i 'll put the phone up to the fence and he 'll talk to the cat			0
@entity7 loves @entity9 with all his heart , he really does			2
' lions which live in captivity have a much longer life expectancy than those living in the wild , experts say mrs @entity71 says the most difficult time for @entity9 is when her husband , who is a professional jazz guitarist , is on tour the 63 - year - old had to get a new bed when the young lion started gnawing on the fabric mr @entity7 sometimes gets criticism for keeping a pet cougar but says @entity9 would be a lot worse off fending for herself			1
he said : ' there are a couple of diehards who say she should be in the wild - but how much wild is there left ? i mean we 're taking all their wild away from them			0
' she 's better off living with us , being fed everyday , being cared for medically , being loved and being treated like she should be treated rather than being chased off her territory or hunted or rundown by a car			2
' i think she has a great life and she 's made my life a whole lot better too			0
' but it 's a lifetime commitment , if you 're not willing to put your whole life to this thing then you should n't own one of these pets			0
