by @entity0 @entity1 : 12:10 est , 20 december 2013 @entity2 : 17:48 est , 20 december 2013 some 87 per cent of gum - chewing teenagers who suffer regular headaches can cure themselves by giving up chewing gum , new research suggests			1
scientists at the @entity11 - affiliated @entity10 , in @entity8 , found that most adolescents who give up the habit experience significant relief			2
the scientists , led by dr @entity16 , believe the finding could allow doctors to cure thousands of patients of migraines and tension headaches without the need for additional tests or medication			1
up to 87 per cent of teenagers who chew gum and suffer regular headaches could cure themselves by giving up chewing gum , new research suggests ‘ out of our 30 patients , 26 reported significant improvement and 19 had complete headache resolution , ’ said dr @entity16			1
‘ 20 of the improved patients later agreed to go back to chewing gum , and all of them reported an immediate relapse of symptoms			1
’ headaches are common in childhood and become more common and frequent during adolescence , particularly among girls			0
typical triggers are stress , tiredness , lack of sleep , heat , video games , noise , sunlight , smoking , missed meals , and menstruation			0
but until now there has been little medical research on the relationship between gum chewing and headaches			1
at @entity10 's @entity60 and @entity61 , dr @entity16 noticed that many patients who reported headaches were daily gum chewers			0
the finding could offer relief to thousands without the need for further tests or medication dr @entity16 found that in many cases , when patients stopped chewing gum at his suggestion , they got substantially better			1
taking a more statistical approach , he asked 30 patients between six and 19 years old , who had chronic migraine or tension headaches and chewed gum daily , to quit chewing gum for one month			1
they had chewed gum for at least an hour a day and some had chewed for more than six hours a day			0
after a month without gum , 19 of the 30 patients reported that their headaches went away entirely and seven reported a decrease in the frequency and intensity of headaches			0
to test the results , 20 of them agreed to resume gum chewing for two weeks			2
all of them reported a return of their symptoms within days			0
two previous studies linked gum chewing to headaches , but offered different explanations			1
one study suggested that gum chewing causes stress to the temporomandibular joint , or @entity103 - the place where the jaw meets the skull			1
the other study blamed aspartame , the artificial sweetener used in most popular chewing gums			1
@entity103 dysfunction has been shown to cause headaches , while the evidence is mixed on aspartame			2
dr @entity16 favours the @entity103 explanation			0
gum only has a flavour for a short period of time , suggesting it does not contain much aspartame , he says			0
if aspartame caused headaches , he reasons , there would be a lot more headaches from diet drinks and artificially sweetened products which also contain it			0
on the other hand , people chew gum well after the taste is gone , putting a significant burden on the @entity103 , which is already the most used joint in the body , he says			2
‘ every doctor knows that overuse of the @entity103 will cause headaches , ’ said dr @entity16			2
‘ i believe this is what 's happening when children and teenagers chew gum excessively			0

87 *%* of gum - chewing teenagers who suffer regular headaches could cure themselves by giving up chewing gum , researchers have discovered
the finding could allow thousands to find relief without tests or medication
one study suggested gum chewing causes stress to the temporomandibular joint , or @entity103 - the place where the jaw meets the skull - causing headaches
another study blamed aspartame , the artificial sweetener used in most chewing gums
