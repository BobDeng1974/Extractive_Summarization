by @entity0 published : 12:01 est , 7 november 2013 updated : 12:32 est , 7 november 2013 a couple have won a landmark legal battle to have 10 wind turbines taken down because they spoil the view from their dream home in @entity6			1
in a judgement which could have widespread implication across @entity9 , including @entity10 , the husband and wife successfully argued that the 360ft high structures ruined their quality of life			1
as well as agreeing that the turbines ‘ spoiled the view ’ , judges noted the ‘ groaning and whistling ’ and ‘ unsightliness of white and red flashing lights ’			2
@entity21 and his wife @entity22 have won a landmark legal battle to have 10 wind turbines taken down because they spoil the view from their dream home in @entity6 now the company responsible has to take them down , and pay large fines and legal expenses			1
it is seen as a major victory for those campaigning against wind farms , and those who believe their spread is destroying both beloved countryside and cultural heritages			0
@entity21 , a retired vet , and his wife @entity22 bought the 18th @entity37 in the @entity38 , in northern @entity6 , in 1996 , after moving from nearby @entity39			1
their restoration of the house and its 42 acres became a labour of love , and they also turned adjoining buildings into a guesthouse			0
victory : @entity21 stands outside his 18th @entity49 in the @entity38 but when , in 2007 , the ten wind turbines went up , they were horrified to suddenly lose their ‘ bucolic and rustic ’ view			1
they first spotted them on returning from a trip to @entity56 , in @entity39 , with mr @entity21 telling @entity57 : ‘ the first evening when we arrived in the chateau after their construction , there was a firework display and we wondered where these lights were coming from			2
a couple have won a landmark legal battle to have 10 wind turbines taken down because they spoil the view from their dream home in @entity6 ‘ we were not even aware that these projects existed			2
' three huge turbines are visible when gazing across the gardens from the bay windows in the chateau ’s grand salon			0
‘ every day we have to suffer the visual and noise pollution			0
i can see the turbines from everywhere in the house , from every room			0
’ the @entity84 launched a civil action against @entity86 ( @entity87 ) , a subsidiary of the energy giant @entity88 , which runs the turbines			1
judges in @entity90 ruled that the structures blighted the countryside , causing the ‘ total disfigurement of a bucolic and rustic landscape ’			0
the company was ordered to pay the @entity96 the equivalent of £ 31,500 in damages and to remove the wind farm within four months or face a fine of £ 450 per day per turbine			0
@entity86 said it would appeal the judgement , but @entity103 , the @entity84 ’ lawyer said : ‘ people are often too scared to take action and suffer in silence			1
‘ today we are saying no - justice has been done and this shows all those who suffer wind farms with a sense of powerlessness that the fight is not vain , that one can have one ’s life respected — one ’s right to peace			0
’ @entity21 and his wife @entity22 bought the 18th @entity120 in the @entity38 , in northern @entity6 ( pictured ) in august , a @entity6 court banned a local council from erecting turbines near the @entity125 abbey in @entity126 , after @entity127 warned they could cost @entity6 ’s most visited provincial tourist site its @entity130 status			1
a plan to build a vast offshore wind farm within view of several @entity126 d - day beaches has also been condemned as ‘ an insult to the memory of the thousands who died there ’			0
@entity10 is a world leader in wind farm technology , with new installations continually being erected across the country , often in areas which provoke criticism .			2
