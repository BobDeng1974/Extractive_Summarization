by @entity0 few people want to dwell on their own death and even fewer want to imagine what they might come to regret when it is too late			2
now a former nurse has shared her experiences of what terminally ill people tend to regret the most			1
@entity9 , a palliative care nurse who looked after people in the last few weeks of their lives , says it is surprising how many dying people have the same regrets			1
@entity9 , a former palliative care nurse , has revealed the top five things dying people tend to regret			1
she says the most common regret people have is that they did not live a life true to themselves perhaps unsurprisingly , it is the simple things in life , like staying in touch with friends and being true to yourself , that most people wished they had been able to achieve			1
ms @entity9 also found men regretted working too hard , while many people wish they had had the courage to more frequently express their feelings			1
inspired by what she discovered , ms @entity9 wrote a book - the @entity33 : a life transformed by @entity35 - about her experiences			1
she said : ' my patients were those who had gone home to die and some incredibly special times were shared			0
' people grow a lot when they are faced with their own mortality and some changes were phenomenal			2
' each experienced a variety of emotions , as expected - denial , fear , anger , remorse , more denial and eventually acceptance			1
' every single patient found their peace before they departed though			0
' when questioned about any regrets they had or anything they would do differently , common themes surfaced again and again			1
' she says the five most common regrets of the elderly are : ' i wish i 'd had the courage to live a life true to myself , not the life others expected of me ' in her book , ms @entity9 says many elderly people regret not keeping up with old friends because ' everyone misses their friends when they are dying ' ' this was the most common regret of all			1
when people realise that their life is almost over and look back clearly on it , it is easy to see how many dreams have gone unfulfilled			1
' most people had not honoured even a half of their dreams and had to die knowing that it was due to choices they had made , or not made			2
health brings a freedom very few realise , until they no longer have it			0
' i wish i had n't worked so hard ' this came from every male patient that i nursed			1
they missed their children 's youth and their partner 's companionship			2
' women also spoke of this regret , but as most were from an older generation , many of the female patients had not been breadwinners			0
all of the men i nursed deeply regretted spending so much of their lives on the treadmill of a work existence			2
' i wish i 'd had the courage to express my feelings ' many people suppressed their feelings in order to keep peace with others			1
as a result , they settled for a mediocre existence and never became who they were truly capable of becoming			0
many developed illnesses relating to the bitterness and resentment they carried as a result			0
' i wish i had stayed in touch with my friends ' often they would not truly realise the full benefits of old friends until their dying weeks and it was not always possible to track them down			0
' many had become so caught up in their own lives that they had let golden friendships slip by over the years			0
' there were many deep regrets about not giving friendships the time and effort that they deserved			2
everyone misses their friends when they are dying			0
' i wish that i had let myself be happier ' this is a surprisingly common one			0
many did not realise until the end that happiness is a choice			0
' they had stayed stuck in old patterns and habits			0
the so - called " comfort " of familiarity overflowed into their emotions , as well as their physical lives			0
' fear of change had them pretending to others , and to their selves , that they were content , when deep within , they longed to laugh properly and have silliness in their life again			0
' ms @entity9 also says a lot of dying people wish they had had the courage to express their feelings because many develop illnesses related to the bitterness they carry as a result of not expressing themselves			1
