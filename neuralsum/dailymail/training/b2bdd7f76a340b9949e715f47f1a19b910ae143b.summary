@entity0 is famous for his penchant for kinky sex accessorised with whips , crops and floggers in his @entity7			1
but actor @entity9 , who plays the character made famous by author @entity11 in the much - anticipated film version of @entity0 , has admitted it 's all new to him			1
an s&m expert had to be called onto the set to teach the @entity17 actor , 32 , who is married with a 15 - month - old baby			2
the actor said he had to learn the technique from a ' kink adviser ' ' we had a guy called @entity32 who was our kink adviser , ' he revealed to @entity21 on today 's episode of this morning			1
the actor said he felt responsible for ensuring the bondage scenes with co-star @entity20 were as authentic as possible , as it 's these elements that have made the erotic novels a hit with people around the world			2
' i probably learnt more than @entity43 , ' he explained			0
' @entity44 is meant to be new to it all and clueless so the onus was on me to be doing things right			0
' @entity9 previously told @entity48 that @entity32 was keen for him witness first hand the kind of sex that is portrayed in the film so he invited him to see the sex dungeon in his house			1
the pair revealed on the @entity56 show what it was like to film the racy adaption of the bestselling erotic novel @entity61 said sex is a big part of the film but there 's also a love story between the two characters @entity9 , pictured with his co-star in another still from the film , visited a sex dungeon to learn more about how to play bondage billiionare @entity0 who was created by author @entity11 the actor recalled : ' i went there , he offered me a beer , and they did … whatever they were into			1
i saw a dominant with two submissives and he became our kink adviser on the film			0
' speaking on the @entity56 programme , he said that sex is inevitably a big part of the movie - which opens in the @entity88 this evening - but warned viewers will be disappointed if that 's all they 're expecting			2
' it 's hard to get away from it as it 's a big part of the story so there 's enough in there to keep you keen , ' he explained			0
' there has to be a good story too , you need something to carry the story through and that 's the love story and the two characters that resonate with people			0
' meanwhile , @entity43 , 25 , told @entity21 that she suffered for her art as in one of the sex scenes , @entity9 threw her so hard onto the bed that she suffered whiplash			2
' at the time she said i threw her like a piece of meat , ' admitted @entity9 , quipping : ' i 'm just a very committed actor ! ' the pair have been busy promoting the film and attending premieres in @entity116 , @entity117 and @entity118 over the past week			2
fifty @entity119 , which was directed by @entity120 , is expected to be a box office success but many of the reviews have n't been favourable so far			0
much of the criticism was directed at @entity9 , with @entity126 film critic @entity125 saying he is not convincing as the bondage billionaire			1
he said : ' as @entity130 , does the @entity128 , @entity129 , pull it off ? he pulls plenty off , as it happens , but not , alas , the part itself			0
@entity43 revealed she suffered from whiplash after @entity9 threw her ' like a piece of meat ' onto the bed in one of the scenes from the highly anticipated film the pair , pictured at the @entity116 premiere , have been working hard to promote the film adaptation of the first book in the trilogy but not all the reveiews have been favourable so far ' for a 27 - year - old billionaire with a hinterland supposedly about the size of @entity151 , @entity130 is strangely uncharismatic			1
' grey by name , grey by personality			0
and for a dedicated sadist he has an odd way with a whip , as if gently swatting a bluebottle that has errantly settled on @entity162 's bottom			0
' the @entity126 's columnist @entity163 said in her review : ' yes , this @entity165 might have its titillating moments , but it just goes on and on and on for no good reason before ending in an abrupt and unsatisfactory way — the very definition of bad sex , not good			1
