@entity0 has insisted he was guilty only of infidelity - not the rape he was jailed for - as he apologised to his girlfriend in a new video and pleaded for a ' second chance ' in football			1
the 25 - year - old former @entity8 player made the comments on @entity10 as his girlfriend @entity11 clutched his arm and wore what appeared to resemble an engagement ring			1
it is the first time he has spoken since his release from prison on friday after serving half of a five - year sentence he received for raping a 19 - year - old woman in his home town of @entity22 , @entity23			1
but he said he was ' determined to continue to fight to clear my name ' and has now submitted his case to the @entity43			1
as he made the video address dressed in a black shirt and tie , his girlfriend clutched his arm , a gold - coloured band visible on the ring finger of her left hand			1
' i made an incredibly foolish decision and failed those people who trusted and believed in me - most of all , @entity50 and our families , ' @entity0 added			2
' it is a rare and extraordinary privilege to be permitted to play professional football			2
now that i 've served the custodial part of my sentence of two and a half years , it is my hope that i will be able to return to football			1
' if that is possible , then i would do so with humility having learned a very painful lesson			2
i would like a second chance but i know not everyone would agree			0
@entity0 , left in his police mugshot and right this week after his release , maintains he was innocent attention : the statement came days after @entity0 was released from @entity71 in @entity72 ( pictured ) evidence : @entity0 ' victim on @entity75 at the hotel in his home town of @entity22 , @entity23 , on the night of the assault ' i do n't believe i have a given right to play again , but for any club to take me on , i 've learned a valuable lesson and know that , over time , i can prove myself to be a positive influence , not just on the pitch but also in the community			1
' @entity0 was driven out of @entity71 in @entity72 in a @entity84 at 5am on friday amid rumours he had been offered a contract by his old club , @entity8 , worth more than £ 500,000			0
released : @entity0 and his girlfriend @entity88 enjoy his freedom on monday in @entity90 , @entity91 @entity8 denied the report in @entity93 , calling it ' false and damaging to the club '			2
@entity0 was jailed for five years in 2012 after being convicted of raping a drunken 19 - year - old after a former team - mate invited her back to a hotel room in his home town of @entity22			1
he admitted having sex with her , but insisted it was consensual			0
the woman told the jury she had no memory of the incident			2
an online petition against @entity0 returning to @entity8 has gained more than 150,000 signatures			1
the release of the two - minute video came hours after the @entity111 was forced to apologise after @entity111 presenter and veteran journalist @entity113 appeared to criticise @entity0 ' victim for being drunk			1
in a trailer for @entity118 discussion show @entity116 on the rehabilitation of criminals , @entity113 said neither footballer @entity0 nor the woman he attacked emerged " with any credit " because she was so intoxicated ' she could barely stand '			2
his comments have incensed victims ' rights campaigners who described the trailer as ' damaging ' and ' deeply offensive '			0
a @entity118 spokesman said : ' there was no intention to suggest that the victim was in any way at fault , and we apologise if the way this live trail was phrased suggested this			0
' tonight 's @entity116 will ask whether a convicted rapist who maintains his innocence should be entitled to get his job back			1
' there was also controversy after tv host @entity142 said the disgraced footballer should be allowed to return to @entity8			0
she and her daughter @entity144 both received rape threats online after she told the @entity146 programme the footballer should get his job back			0
she had added the victim was ‘ drunk ’ and the rape was ‘ unpleasant ’ but ‘ not violent ’			0
ms @entity11 ( right ) has led a campaign to have @entity0 ' conviction overturned in a case review @entity0 , pictured in action for @entity8 , wants to restart his career after serving a sentence for rape @entity157 , for @entity158 , said after the @entity111 controversy today : ' to infer that being drunk is in any way " morally " comparable to committing the serious and violent crime of rape is deeply offensive and will undoubtedly have caused considerable distress to the huge numbers of survivors of sexual violence who will inevitably have been listening			0
' let us not forget that there is a rape survivor at the heart of this story , who is currently living with the devastating and potentially lifelong impact not only of having been sexually violated but of the terrible abuse she has subsequently suffered in the public domain			0
' it is partly because of the kind of shaming , victim - blaming attitudes voiced by @entity113 this morning that currently only 15 per cent of all those who are raped choose to report to the police			2
' ' in may 2011 in a hotel in @entity23 , by cheating on my partner @entity88 i hurt the woman i love with all my heart			1
' since that night i 've constantly regretted my act of infidelity and the damage that has been done on so many fronts because of it			0
' foolish ' : @entity0 with his girlfriend @entity11 ' the support that 's been shown by @entity88 , our friends and family during the trial and the time spent in prison has kept me strong			1
' it ca n't have been an easy thing to stand by someone who the court found guilty of such a destructive act			0
i will be forever grateful			0
' even though i 've been released from prison i 'm determined to continue to fight to clear my name and it is public knowledge that an application to refer my case back to the @entity213 has recently been submitted to the @entity43 by my lawyers			1
' the application seeks to demonstrate that the acts i engaged in on that night were consensual in nature and not rape			0
' i made an incredibly foolish decision and failed those people who trusted and believed in me - most of all , @entity50 and our families			2
' it is a rare and extraordinary privilege to be permitted to play professional football			2
' now that i 've served the custodial part of my sentence of two and a half years , it is my hope that i will be able to return to football			1
