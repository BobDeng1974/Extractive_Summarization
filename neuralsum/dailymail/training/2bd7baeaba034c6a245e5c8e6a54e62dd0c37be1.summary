by @entity0 a couple were told their monthly electricity payments would be increasing from £ 87 to £ 53.5million after a computer error led to a power company sending them a £ 500million bill			1
grandparents @entity9 and @entity10 were told by energy suppliers npower that they had run up the huge bill - and if they did not pay it off their monthly direct debit would rise to £ 53.5million			1
the problem arose when the couple 's previous supplier , @entity16 , installed a new meter at their 16th century home in the village of @entity21 , near @entity22 , @entity23			1
mr @entity41 , 62 , and his wife , 59 , did not notice the problem as they paid their bill by direct debit each month and were never asked to give a reading			1
however , after they switched suppliers to npower in may , a workman was sent round to read their meter			1
when he entered a reading of ' zero ' , npower ’s computer wrongly assumed the dials must have gone all round the clock - and automatically flagged up the huge bill			2
the @entity60 were told they did n’t need to do anything because the money would be taken automatically from their bank			2
but accountant mr @entity41 said : ' there was just one problem with that - i did n’t quite have £ 53million in my current account at the time			0
' cause : the problem came after @entity16 , which has its headquarters ( pictured ) in @entity71 , installed a new meter at the couple 's home - but it was wired incorrectly bizarrely , the online bill also showed that the couple had actually overpaid and were in credit by £ 1,362.69			1
despite repeated phone calls to npower , and contacting the regulator @entity80 , the couple are still waiting for a refund and written confirmation they wo n’t have to fork out the £ 53,480,062.00 a month			2
' it ’s a good job they did n’t actually try to take all that money from my bank account , ' mr @entity41 said			0
' not only would it have gone way over my overdraft limit , but it could have brought down the bank and sparked another global financial crisis			0
' the electricity board have admitted it is a mistake and told us we do n’t need to pay the money but we are still waiting for the refund they owe us			1
' @entity98 , one of the notorious @entity100 witches who was hanged 400 years ago , is reputed to have once lived in the couple ’s historic cottage			0
' perhaps she put a curse on the meter , ' joked mr @entity41			0
' but if the electricity board does n’t sort this out quick i ’ll get her to put a curse on them and turn all their bosses into toads			0
' a spokesman for npower apologised yesterday and said : ' this was clearly a mistake			0
' mr @entity41 ’s meter was incorrectly wired by his previous supplier and not npower , which had a knock - on effect to how we billed the account			2
' his payments are set at £ 87 , so no extra money will be taken and we have processed a refund which should be with mr @entity41 on tuesday			1
' a spokesman from @entity16 told @entity126 he was looking into the incident .			0
