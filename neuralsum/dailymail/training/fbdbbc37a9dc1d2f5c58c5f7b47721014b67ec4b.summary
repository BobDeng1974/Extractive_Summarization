@entity0 are still on the hunt for a manager , but caretaker boss @entity3 is staking his claim after beating @entity5 to remain unbeaten in his three games in charge			1
@entity8 , the @entity0 owner , has told @entity3 he is needed to manage in the academy but the 49 - year - old followed up a win against @entity12 and draw at @entity13 with a remarkable victory over @entity5			2
@entity15 struck an unstoppable 25 - yard free - kick in the 79th minute to put them ahead after goals from @entity19 and @entity20 had the scores level			1
@entity22 then ran through to finish the game off with @entity0 ’ third goal in the last minute			2
@entity0 celebrate @entity26 's free - kick , which put them 2 - 1 up on the night @entity28 ( left ) and @entity29 ( right ) battle it out at the @entity31 @entity19 ( right ) celebrates with @entity32 ( left ) after opening the scoring for @entity5 @entity5 : @entity34 , @entity32 , @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 ( @entity39 70 ) , @entity19 , @entity29 , @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 substitutes not used : @entity45 ( @entity44 ) , @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity43 , @entity49 scorer : @entity19 6 , booked : @entity29 84 @entity0 : @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity15 , @entity53 , @entity54 ( @entity55 76 ) , @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity35 , @entity20 , @entity58 ( @entity59 76 ) , @entity22 substitutes not used : @entity60 ( gk ) , @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 scorers : @entity20 67 , @entity15 82 , @entity22 89 booked : @entity15 80 referee : @entity67 attendance : 9307 since @entity72 was sacked after just 70 days in charge , former @entity0 players , out - of - work managers and even a piece of computer coaching software have thrown their hat in the ring for the job			1
the latter may have just been a pr stunt but @entity3 is proving he knows what he is doing			0
@entity5 were in complete control in the first half , before and after taking an early lead			0
it took until only the sixth minute for them open the scoring when midfielder @entity19 curled a sumptuous effort into the bottom left corner			1
and had it not been for @entity51 in the @entity0 goal , the home side would have streaked ahead			0
he was sharp from the off , diving to push wide @entity38 ’s fierce left - foot shot which was heading for the top right corner on three minutes			0
@entity40 , on the right of @entity5 ’s midfield , then tested him twice in four minutes but the @entity96 was equal to the task on both occasions			0
@entity5 really should have made their first - half dominance count and were punished when @entity0 equalised on 67 minutes			1
@entity5 players celebrate after an early @entity19 goal put them ahead against @entity0 @entity3 , who was this week ruled out of the running for permanent @entity0 manager , in the dugout @entity20 managed to measure his run to stay onside before slotting the ball into the bottom left corner for his first league goal since moving from @entity111 side @entity110 in the summer			1
two minutes later @entity0 broke through again but this time time @entity58 shot wide			0
they still had to rely on their goalkeeper for more heroics to keep them in the game before their late flourish sealed what had seemed an unlikely win			0
