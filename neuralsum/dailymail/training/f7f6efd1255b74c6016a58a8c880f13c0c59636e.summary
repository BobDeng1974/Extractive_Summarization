a chartered surveyor is set to spend two months inside an eight foot water tank in a desolate island as he tries to raise money for charity			1
@entity5 is planning to set two endurance records by living on the 100ft island of @entity8 and raise money for the @entity11 charity			1
@entity8 is constantly pounded by 3,000 miles of @entity13 swell			1
the world 's largest recorded oceanic waves of over 95 feet were recorded there in 2000 - some 19 feet higher than @entity8 itself			1
@entity5 will live on the isolated 100ft island of @entity8 inside an eight foot water tank that he has converted to be inhabitable being in such an isolated location , only four people have ever slept on @entity8			1
less than 100 have landed on it			0
but mr @entity5 , 38 , from @entity22 , has even created a yellow living pod from an 8ft water tank , and made it cosy with spray - on insulation foam in a bid to spend 60 days on @entity8			1
he recently won Â£ 3500 from the @entity28 - following a presentation at the @entity30 in @entity31 - to help his bid , set for early june			0
the current record for time spent on @entity8 is 40 days back in 1985 - when ex-sas soldier @entity35 lived on the rock from 26 may to 4 july - to affirm @entity38 's claim to the islet			1
mr @entity5 , who stayed for a short while on the isolated islet 225 miles west of the @entity42 , hopes to spend a record - breaking 60 days on the rock to raise money for @entity11			1
he plans to spend 60 days on the island inside this eight foot water tank that he converted ' the @entity48 survival shelter i have constructed is almost complete , ' said mr @entity5			1
' it was recently insulated by @entity51 in @entity52 , and i am now finishing it internally			0
the majority of my equipment and supplies have arrived and i have been distributing and packing them in the plastic drums , donated by @entity59 of @entity60 , which i will use to get my kit onto @entity8			2
' i fully expect that i will have to repack several times to ensure i know where everything is , but otherwise i feel confident that i will be ready in a month 's time for this amazing adventure			0
' the expedition is being sponsored by @entity69 who will provide a stove and the @entity72 needed to cook			0
in 2011 tv adventurer @entity73 said he wanted to lead an exhibition to " reclaim " @entity8 for @entity38			2
the isolated island of @entity8 in the @entity42 is a 100ft wide and can attract waves of up to 95 feet high ' i once tried to invade @entity8 , unsuccessfully , and have first - hand experience of the ridiculousness of @entity8 's size and the recklessness of attempting a landing			1
it is a realm of the sea , a kingdom governed only by the weather , ' he said			0
' @entity5 's attempt to not only land , but stay for 60 days and raise money for a very worthy charity is an apt gesture for an island so immersed in eccentricity			1
' survival expert @entity95 added that it was ' an ambitious , exciting - and wonderfully mad - project , but in aid of a life - changing charity that needs our help			0
' even tv adventurer @entity73 failed to land @entity8 and he has praised mr @entity5 for the attempt @entity104 radio enthusiasts landed on the remote @entity13 islet - @entity38 's loneliest outpost - in october 2011 and transmitted for more than 15 hours			1
the island is the core of an eroded volcano that erupted around 55 million years ago			0
the rock is 100ft wide and 70ft high and in the past @entity110 , @entity111 and @entity112 have lain claim to @entity8 and to the possible oil and gas reserves surrounding it			1
ownership is now being examined by the @entity119 in the light of competing claims from @entity111 , the @entity122 and @entity110			0
the earliest recorded landing on @entity8 was believed to be in 1810 , by an officer called @entity125 from the @entity126			2
in 2011 an adventurer dramatically cancelled his attempt to land on @entity8 to reaffirm the @entity38 's ownership of it - after half his team suddenly quit two days into the expedition			2
@entity132 wanted to put a new plaque on @entity8 to replace the one that was left in 1955 in what was the last territorial expansion of the @entity137			2
@entity138 mr @entity132 also had to cancel a bid in 2010 to reach @entity8 after there was a hold - up in getting the islet 's first planning permission from the @entity144 - the nearest local authority			2
the @entity146 annexed @entity8 in 1955 and the @entity147 declared it part of the @entity42			2
its exact position was first charted by @entity146 surveyor captain @entity150 in 1831			0
but it was on september 18 , 1955 , that the island was officially annexed by the @entity153 when three marines - lieutenant - commander @entity155 , sergeant @entity156 and corporal @entity157 - and civilian naturalist @entity158 were deposited on the island by a @entity146 helicopter			0
@entity8 is a formidable opponent for any adventurer , located 225 miles west of the @entity42 and surrounded by choppy water the team cemented in a brass plaque on @entity165 and hoisted the @entity166 to stake the @entity38 's claim			1
during his reconnaissance trip last june , mr @entity5 did unfurl a @entity166 and tweeted on @entity169 : ' @entity170 ' but did , however , lose some equipment during his brief stay			0
the occupiable area of @entity8 , named in 1955 as @entity165 after the first recorded person to land there , is just 11 feet x 4 feet , and is just 13 feet below the summit			0
there are no trees or bushes on the rock - just algae , seaweeds and one black lichen			0
just over 20 species of sea bird and only six species of animal have been recorded on or near @entity8 .			0

@entity5 plans to live n 100ft wide @entity8 for two months
he has converted an eight foot water tank to live in for the duration
he plans to raise money for charity help for heroes
