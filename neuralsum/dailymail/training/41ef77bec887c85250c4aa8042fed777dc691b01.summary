by @entity0 @entity1 , 83 , waited a year to have the tumour investigated - by which time it was the size of a football a grandfather had a tumour the size of a football removed from his scrotum after waiting a year to see his doctor about it			1
the 9lb ( 4kg ) growth was so bad that @entity1 ’s relatives could spot it though his clothes and told him to go to the doctor			1
today the retired butcher from @entity18 , @entity19 , praised surgeons at the @entity21 who managed to remove the huge growth			2
mr @entity1 had a sarcoma - a rare type of cancer that affects soft tissues , muscles and bone			1
he is now urging others not to wait so long before being investigated			0
the 83 - year - old noticed the swelling in his groin area but did n't want to make a fuss - so left it			1
but over the next 12 months it gradually got bigger and bigger			0
he said : ' you could see it in my trousers			0
the tumour was getting bigger and bigger but i kept putting it off - i do n’t like a fuss			1
' i was n’t in pain			0
if i had been in pain , i probably would have gone earlier			0
i was still doing the gardening and doing everything as normal			0
' it was his daughter @entity50 , 54 , and son @entity52 who spotted the lump - and the fact their father was getting tired and sleeping in his chair more often			2
mr day 's gp referred him to a urologist at @entity19 's @entity61 last december and after a series of scans , he was booked in for surgery in february			2
his daughter @entity50 , 54 , added : ' with the size of it , i thought they were going to say it ’s too late , there ’s nothing we can do			0
' when you think of cancer , you think that ’s it			2
it is remarkable what they have done for him			0
' mr @entity1 will have more scans every three months to make sure he remains cancer - free			1
his surgeon , mr @entity83 , said : ' lumps and bumps are common			0
one in 100 turn out to be a sarcoma			2
' sarcomas are treatable and if people come forward for treatment earlier , it can be easier			0
