reports claim the deal is worth $ 2.5 billion ( £ 1.5 billion )			1
@entity19 , head of @entity6 , made the announcement on @entity3 's official blog ' today is an incredibly exciting day for our team as @entity9 and the @entity1 franchise join @entity3 , ' explained @entity19 , head of @entity6			1
' our relationship with @entity9 began when we initially talked to the team about bringing @entity1 to the console			1
' @entity1 quickly became the top online game on @entity30 , with over two billion hours played on @entity31 in the last two years			2
' that working relationship set the ground work for other opportunities			0
we ’ve long seen the incredible potential of @entity1			2
' @entity0 ( pictured ) created @entity1 in 2009 before releasing it widely in november 2011 ' we ’re excited to welcome @entity9 to the @entity3 family and we are thrilled to support the success and longevity of @entity1 for years to come			1
' mr @entity19 added that @entity39 - the annual @entity1 convention - will continue next year , and the firm will have ' much more to share in the coming months			1
' the deal exceeds the amount @entity44 paid for virtual reality headset firm which creates @entity46			1
in a statement released following the acquisition , @entity0 said : ' i 'm leaving @entity9			1
' a relatively long time ago , i decided to step down from @entity1 development			2
' @entity51 [ @entity52 ] was the perfect person to take over leading it , and i wanted to try to do new things			0
' i was at home with a bad cold a couple of weeks ago when the internet exploded with hate against me over some kind of @entity61 situation that i had nothing to do with			0
i tweeted this in frustration			2
' i ’m not an entrepreneur			0
i ’m not a ceo			0
i ’m a nerdy computer programmer who likes to have opinions on @entity69			0
' as soon as this deal is finalised , i will leave @entity9 and go back to doing @entity71 and small web experiments			1
' considering the public image of me already is a bit skewed , i do n’t expect to get away from negative comments by doing this , but at least now i wo n’t feel a responsibility to read them			0
' i ’m aware this goes against a lot of what i ’ve said in public			0
i have no good response to that			0
thank you for turning @entity1 into what it has become , but there are too many of you , and i ca n’t be responsible for something this big			2
' in one sense , it belongs to @entity3 now			2
in a much bigger sense , it ’s belonged to all of you for a long time , and that will never change			0
' it ’s not about the money			0
it ’s about my sanity			0
' following the news , @entity69 user @ aaronmblevin wrote : ' if @entity1 can teach us anything today , it 's that the interests of capital always come before the interests of the collective			2
' ' today is an incredibly exciting day for our team as @entity9 and the @entity1 franchise join @entity3 , ' explained @entity19 , head of @entity6			1
' we 're excited to welcome @entity9 to the @entity3 family and we are thrilled to support the success and longevity of @entity1 for years to come ' ( game still pictured ) while @ karl_haynes tweeted : ' now @entity1 is going to get more and more expensive , while working less and less			1

as a player progresses they can earn advanced tools and building blocks in different materials			0
the game was initially made for the pc but there are now @entity31 and mobile versions available			2
in 2012 , @entity0 criticised @entity162 8 and @entity3 for trying to ' ruin the pc as an open platform ' , he also separately said his price to ‘ endorse cr * p ’ was $ 2 billion dollars , which may explain the pricing of the deal			1
more than 16,645,000 people have bought the game , so far , and it is an online phenomenon			0
there are even @entity172 channels dedicated to showing people how to play the game , which in same cases make the owners enough money in advertising to quit their jobs			0
aside from the revenue that @entity9 will generate for @entity3 , experts believe the firm will use it to push existing services on new customers			1
@entity186 , director , @entity187 at @entity188 told @entity189 : ' @entity3 's move to buy @entity1 developer and owner @entity9 may come as a surprise to the game 's more fervent fans , but it is rooted in commercial , if not cultural , sense			1
in 2012 , founder @entity0 , who tweets under the handle @ notch , openly criticised @entity3 's @entity201 software ( pictured )			1
he also said ' got an email from @entity3 , wanting to help ' certify ' @entity1 for @entity201			1
i told them to stop trying to ruin the pc as an open platform ' @entity0 also separately tweeted this his price to ‘ endorse cr * p ’ was $ 2 billion dollars , which may explain the pricing of the deal			1
the deal exceeds the amount @entity44 paid for virtual reality headset firm which creates @entity46 ' the news robustly dismisses the idea that games are no longer at the core of @entity3 's strategic direction and also underlines the growing importance of independent titles alongside big - budget games			1
' @entity1 is arguably the best - positioned independently - owned ip across the games sector today			2
' while it has already generated over 54 million games sales and revenues approaching $ 500m , @entity1 is a franchise built to last , making the likely heavy investment required to secure @entity9 significantly less risky than many other recent acquisitions within the games or app sectors			1
' @entity3 bought @entity231 's phone business for $ 7.3 billion in april and is also seeking to boost @entity3 's @entity233 system , which has gained little traction against @entity236 's iphones and @entity239 's @entity238 system			1
@entity3 chief executive @entity240 has made mobile phones and internet services priorities for the company as its traditional businesses - @entity162 and office software installed on desktops - slow down or decline			1
' we believe the acquisition of the ubiquitous @entity1 game strategically makes sense as @entity3 looks for ways to drive users toward its nascent mobile hardware business , where it can leverage and cross-sell a wide range of its higher - margin software , such as @entity261 and @entity162 , ' @entity249 analyst @entity248 added			1
professor of practice @entity262 told @entity189 : ' this move is a reflection of the ' platforming ' strategy that @entity240 and others recognise as critical to building a strong customer base			0
' @entity3 started @entity6 as a separate area but this move for @entity9 demonstrates it 's still very much a core platform for user traffic generation			1
' the online gaming industry is fast moving from niche collective enthusiast to mass market and @entity1 is a logical move as big business follows the traffic numbers in the digital world			2
' @entity1 made more than $ 100 million last year and has over 100 million registered users with 14.3 million copies of the software game on the pc			1
' it is another case of a blockbuster software investment to drive the gaming platform industry			0
' since last november , @entity1 has become one of publishing 's most successful franchises with a series of compact , illustrated books , too			2
this includes three guides - @entity1 : @entity295 , @entity1 : @entity296 and @entity1 : @entity297 - that have already sold more than 6 million copies combined , according to publisher @entity300			2
in october , @entity302 released @entity303 , a @entity305 gaming map that lets users them explore the whole of the @entity309 and build new settlements in their virtual back gardens			0
@entity303 was built using @entity302 maps of the @entity309 as a base and was constructed using 22 billion building blocks from the game			0
it covers the equivalent of 86,000 square miles of mainland @entity318 and the surrounding islands and each block represents 50 square metres .			0
