@entity0 said : ' the same thing happened with @entity24 last year			1
remember all the criticism for him after he just arrived in the @entity10			2

i am sure we bought the centre - back that we need in him			1
this year with him , @entity38 ( @entity39 ) , @entity24 , ( @entity41 ) @entity40 and @entity42 we have centre - backs that i can assure you will play very well			1

' but i think we must improve in general , not just talking about the defending			0
we must create more chances , we must score more goals			0
' we are working on that and i am absolutely sure we will return to be the same team we were in the most important part of last season			0

and i do n't think we are any worse this season			0
