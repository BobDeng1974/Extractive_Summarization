primary school children were more familiar with @entity2 's lager brand than other consumer products primary school children recognise the @entity2 ’s lager brand more easily than other consumer products , a survey shows			1
the @entity8 brewery giant , which uses two humorous beach characters in its tv ads , was immediately recognised as a drinks brand by 93 per cent of youngsters aged ten and 11			2
that was higher than the 87 per cent who recognised @entity15 ’s as a food product , the 86 per cent who immediately knew @entity18 ’s were biscuits and the 84 per cent for @entity21 ’s ice cream			1
the same study found that half – 47 per cent – of primary school age children associate @entity26 beer with the @entity28 national football team , where it is the official sponsor			1
similarly , almost six in ten boys associated @entity31 with @entity32 , which is the club shirt sponsor			0
there was a similar story in @entity36 where almost half of children and 60 per cent of boys correctly associated carling with the @entity36 national football team			1
the brand sponsored the @entity42 until 2014			0
the figures come from alcohol campaigners and academics who claim they are evidence of a need for radical new controls on the way alcohol is marketed to protect children			1
this would include a ban on advertising on tv before the 9pm watershed , a phased end to the sponsorship of major sporting events and teams , plus restrictions on cinema advertising			0
the survey of more than 800 primary school children in @entity28 and @entity36 looked at the recognition of alcohol brands , alcohol sponsorship , tv and social media use , and whether they had tried alcohol			1
at the same time as 93 per cent of youngsters knew @entity2 ’s was a lager brand , four in five recognised the characters ‘ @entity72 ’ from its tv commercial			2
the humour is particularly appealing to teenage boys with one commercial featuring a beach volleyball game and young women in skimpy bikinis			0
in others , they are seen dispensing ‘ agony uncle ’ advice from a hut on a golden sandy beach to young @entity88 men , including guidance on whether a girlfriend is likely to end up looking like her mother			0
advertising : four in five children recognised the characters ‘ @entity72 ’ from @entity2 's tv commercial the commercials have been hugely successful in financial terms with some industry experts suggesting that for every £ 1 spent on the adverts , @entity2 ’s sold an extra £ 32 of beer			1
however , health campaigners say this success is also spilling over to attract youngsters to the brand and the idea of drinking			2
an expert in marketing and its effects on children , professor @entity110 , said : ‘ this research shows that alcohol marketing is clearly making an impression on our children			1
‘ existing evidence shows that exposure to alcohol marketing leads young people to start drinking at an earlier age and to drink more			1
half of primary school age children associate @entity26 beer with the @entity28 national football team , where it is the official sponsor ‘ as the @entity130 rugby kicks off with @entity131 as its “ official beer ” , thousands of children across the @entity88 will once again see alcohol associated with a major sporting event			1
’ the professor is the founder of the @entity134 at the @entity135 and has also advised the government on the issue of advertising and children			2
new research from the @entity141 shows high public support for better protection for children and young people from alcohol marketing			1

more than eight in ten – 84 per cent - believe alcohol advertising in cinemas should only be shown if films have an 18 certificate			0
the groups @entity158 , @entity159 , @entity160 and @entity161 have come together to call for these measures to be implemented			0
head of policy at @entity158 , @entity164 , said : ‘ this research shows just how many of our children are being exposed to alcohol marketing , with an even bigger impact being made on those children with an interest in sport			1
‘ children get bombarded with pro-drinking messages , when the turn on the tv , go to the cinema or walk down the road , and the existing codes are failing to protect them			0
’ while @entity2 ’s is promoted as @entity8 it is actually made in @entity180 by the @entity182 company @entity181			2
the @entity183 , which speaks for brewers , said drinking across all age groups , including the young is falling			0
it said the @entity88 already has strict controls ensuring marketing is not directed to children			2
almost six in ten boys associated @entity31 with @entity32 , which is the club shirt sponsor ( pictured is @entity192 at @entity193 last month ) chief executive , @entity194 , said : ‘ any objective look at this issue would highlight that alcohol consumption in the @entity88 is sharply down , by 18 per cent since 2004 , and drinking among young people is also down			0
‘ advertising designed to achieve brand differentiation does not encourage irresponsible consumption , nor is it aimed at young people			0
‘ and if we want more young people to get active , why pursue policies that would undermine sports sponsorship ? around £ 300million comes from alcohol sponsorship , with some £ 50million going directly to grassroots sport			0
