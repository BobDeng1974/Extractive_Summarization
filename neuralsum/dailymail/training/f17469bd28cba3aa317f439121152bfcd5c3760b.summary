@entity0 tells how to spot a fake psychic people spend their whole lives looking for answers and guidance but with endless supposed psychics available on the market there is too much potential for soul searchers to be ripped off			1
so @entity11 asks celebrity psychic , @entity0 , how to spot the difference between a genuine and fake psychic			1
@entity15 , 56 , has been open to the spiritual world since she survived a near - death experience at just 10 - years - old after being abducted , beaten and then left to die in @entity19 in southern @entity20			2
' i know it sounds stupid - it was nothing much but i just heard this voice say ' you 're going to be ok ' - it was nothing more than that but no one believed me - they just thought i was hallucinating - and then the next minute i heard the police sirens , ' she said			2
' i think that had something to do with it - but everyone has an awakening experience			0
' @entity15 believes that anyone who is open to the possibility can become a psychic - however , that 's not to say that there are n't frauds out there trying to make a quick buck anyway they can			1
@entity15 offers some handy tips on how to carefully choose a psychic that genuinely wants to help you rather than trying to dig deep into your pockets			0
the first rule of thumb is to make sure the psychic is a reputable source : @entity15 says to do your homework on the person you are going to see or take recommendations through word of mouth			1
' beware of someone who is actually out there that you 've never heard of and they make all of these ridiculous claims , ' @entity15 advises			0
' if you have had good reports on a person that is better - the biggest claim to fame is not necessarily the better one than the little lady down the street because a lot of the time they do n't deliver			1
i 've got so many people say they have got these evil curses and they are convinced they have these curses on them			0
' ' i 've tried to tell them everyone goes through bad luck and you 've just to work through your bad luck to get your good luck			0
' ' be positive with what you are a dealt but it takes a lot to change that around			0
' do n't be fooled into thinking you have a curse or a spell - it 's all nonsense according to @entity15 avoid psychics when you are feeling vulnerable : ' be careful when are you are in time of grief because you can really get ripped off			1
' ' a good psychic would send someone to a counsellor - but say you 've got someone who wants to speak to a dead person everyday - there are people trying to milk them for money all of the time			2
' frauds will prey on those who are feeling at their most vulnerable , @entity15 warns			2
' if you see them once and you feel good that 's ok , but if they keep wanting to see you and keep taking your money that 's a bad sign			0
' hotlines can also be a trap for those who feel that they have nowhere else to turn			0
' people just keep ringing the 1800 numbers - they get on the line because they just split up with their boyfriend - they will end up spending a lot of money			0
' do n't believe everything you are told : @entity0 met a 40 - year - old woman who was told when she was just 14 - years - old that she would never have children			1
' nobody should says things like that - if you 're wrong that plants a seed , ' @entity0 says			1
' i looked at her palm and told her it looked like she would have two children then i went and had my baby - it does make you psychic having your own baby - any woman will tell you that			1
' ' then i went back to the job a few months later and the woman was pregnant			0
i do n't know if she ended up having two but it gives me a lot of joy to see that			0
