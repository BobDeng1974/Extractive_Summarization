a giant prehistoric ‘ terror bird ’ - once thought to have been a ruthless predator which snapped the necks of mammals with its enormous beak - was actually a vegetarian , according to a new study			1
the two - metre gastornis was a flightless creature which lived in @entity11 between 40 and 55 million years ago			1
because of its size and ominous appearance , it was thought to be a top carnivore , the @entity13 conference in @entity14 was told			1
dr @entity18 ( right ) , from the @entity19 , said : ' the ' terror bird ' was thought to have used its huge beak to grab and break the neck of its prey			1
' the fossilised remains of the @entity27 ( mock - up pictured left ) that were studied were found in a former open cast coal mine but now a team of @entity31 researchers , who studied fossilised remains of the beasts found in a former open cast coal mine , say they believe it was actually not a meat eater			2
dr @entity18 , of the @entity19 , said : ' the terror bird was thought to have used its huge beak to grab and break the neck of its prey , which is supported by biomechanical modelling of its bite force			1
' it lived after the dinosaurs became extinct and at a time when mammals were at an early stage of evolution and relatively small ; thus , the terror bird was though to have been a top predator at that time on land			2
' but recent research cast doubt on its fearsome reputation			0
palaeontologists in the @entity54 found footprints believed to belong to the @entity54 cousin of gastornis , and these do not show the imprints of sharp claws , used to grapple prey , that might be expected of a raptor			1
palaeontologists in the @entity54 found footprints believed to belong to the @entity54 cousin of gastornis ( gastornis pictured ) , and these do not show the imprints of sharp claws used to grapple prey , that might be expected of a raptor some paleontologists even suggested the gastornis hunted small horses ( mock - up pictured )			1
the reality is that it was probably far too heavy to chase such mammals and instead lived off a diet of plants and maybe nuts and seeds also , the bird ’s sheer size and inability to move fast made some believe it could n’t have preyed on early mammals - though others claim it might have ambushed them			1
the gastornis was around two metres tall and weight several hundred pounds			0
it was named after @entity83 who found the first remains			0
the bird was one of the largest animals alive during the late @entity90 - @entity89 period			0
until now many experts believed that the creature was a silent ambush hunter in the thick forests that ate prey such as small horses			2
gastornis fossils are common at the @entity97 site in @entity31 , and in the @entity54			0
dr @entity18 and his colleagues took a new approach to determine the diet of gastornis , and by analysing the calcium isotope composition in fossilised bones , they were able to identify what proportion of the creature ’s diet was plant or animal , and its position in the food chain			1
this relies on the calcium isotope becoming lighter as it passes through the food chain			0
scientists analysed the isotopes of known predators , including @entity118 , herbivores , and mammals living today			0
they then compared these to those of the terror bird			0
their results showed that the calcium isotope compositions of terror bird bones are similar to those of herbivorous mammals and dinosaurs and not carnivorous ones			0
but researchers want to cross check their data using other fossil assemblages before confirming their findings			0
the creature was thought to a feasome animal than used its beak to maul prey and fight off competition ( mock - up pictured )			1

dr @entity18 said : “ @entity159 enamel preserves original geochemical signatures much better than bone , but since gastornis did n’t have any teeth , we ’ve had to work with their bones to do our calcium isotope assay			2
' because calcium is a major proportion of bone - around 40 % by weight - its composition is unlikely to have been affected much by fossilisation			2
however , we want to be absolutely confident in our findings by analysing known herbivores and carnivores using fossilised bone from the same site and the same time period			0
this will give us an appropriate reference frame for the terror bird values			0

because of its size and fearsome appearance , paleontologists believed the creature was a top carnivore that used it beak to break its prey *'s* neck
but analysis of its bones has revealed that its diet was probably plant - rich
