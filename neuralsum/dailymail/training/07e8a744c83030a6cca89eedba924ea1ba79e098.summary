by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 toppled @entity3 with his first @entity5 hat - trick , leaving manager @entity6 to claim the champions can not expect to defend the title from so far adrift			1
@entity9 scored three times in 32 minutes at @entity11 before @entity12 pulled back a late goal for @entity3 , who finished the game with 10 men after @entity17 was dismissed late on			1
@entity19 ’s side are now 14 points behind leaders @entity22 , 13 behind @entity23 and 12 points off @entity5			1
‘ it is a 14 - point difference , and 13 and 12			0
can they recover to one of these teams ? they can			0
but to three of them ? it needs three teams to almost collapse			1
’ @entity19 promised that @entity3 would refuse to surrender the title			1
he confessed he had hoped to be better placed at this stage of his debut @entity38 season but rejected the notion of a crisis			0
‘ that ’s your word , not mine , ’ he said			0
‘ what we wo n’t do is throw in the towel until we ca n’t get there			0
the job is to try to finish first			2
i was hoping to win more and be competing a bit more than we ’ve been but that will come			0
’ @entity19 did not complain about @entity17 ’s red card , for a crude challenge on @entity53 , and @entity55 ’s claim for a penalty in the first half , after a tackle by @entity59			1
‘ it would have been a soft one , ’ said @entity19 , who accepted @entity60 had been fortunate to escape a red card for a reckless tackle on @entity63			1
belief : @entity19 believes his @entity3 team can still win the @entity68 ‘ @entity17 was n’t a sending off but i ’ve seen @entity69 ’s and that could have been one , ’ he said			1
@entity6 celebrated becoming the fastest manager to accrue 100 @entity68 wins — and the century came against the same team he beat for his first			2
the only blemish for @entity5 was a knee injury to @entity77 , who insisted on carrying on because all substitutes were used			0
‘ it is the lateral ligaments in his knee and it will be weeks , ’ said @entity6			2
‘ it ’s a pity for @entity84 but it ’s time for @entity86			0
’ @entity19 always knew succeeding sir @entity89 , who enjoyed 26 years of success at @entity38 , would not be easy			2
but he conceded the performances of his team have not been up to scratch so far			0
delight : @entity5 player celebrate @entity2 's ( right ) second goal against @entity3 at @entity11 damning : @entity6 claimed @entity3 's defeat by @entity5 puts the @entity97 out of the title race @entity3 looked ordinary at times on sunday			1
@entity6 's men were more compact , they looked far more incisive on the attack and unlike @entity3 , their defensive stability never seemed in doubt			1
the table does not look pretty for @entity19			2
@entity3 sit in seventh , just one point ahead of @entity107			2
they are six points adrift of the top four and that margin will increase by one more point if @entity111 beat @entity112 on monday			1
one reporter put it to @entity19 that his team were in crisis			0
again , the @entity117 disagreed : ' that 's your opinion			0
crisis is your word , not my word			0
' tough to take : @entity126 ( left ) , @entity55 ( centre ) and @entity125 look on in disbelief up top : @entity55 ( right ) gets past @entity5 's @entity129 during the @entity68 clash seeing red : @entity17 ( left ) was sent off for a foul on @entity53 in the second half seeing red : @entity60 ( second right ) deserved to go for this two - footed lunge on @entity63			1

@entity3 need teams to ' collapse ' to win the league , says @entity6
@entity19 's men now 14 points behind leaders @entity22
@entity3 are also six points adrift of the top four
but @entity19 insists , ' the job is still to finish first '
adds that @entity17 's red card ' was *n't* a sending off ' but @entity60 deserved to go
