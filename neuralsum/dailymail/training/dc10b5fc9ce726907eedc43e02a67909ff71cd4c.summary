the @entity1 meteor shower is set to mark the start of @entity3 in style this weekend when it makes an appearance in the north to north - eastern skies			2
astronomers predict the meteor shower will peak on 3 january at 9pm est - or 4 january at 2am gmt - and will be visible in northern regions , near the @entity12 constellation			1
the @entity1 shower is one of the year 's most spectacular events , but also the shower that most astronomers miss because it 's very brief and intense			1
the @entity1 meteor shower is set to mark the start of @entity3 in style this weekend when it makes an appearance in the north to north - eastern skies			2
pictured is a meteor streaking past stars during the annual @entity1 meteor shower in @entity25 , @entity27 province , january 4 , 2014 it could provide people in the northern latitudes with the opportunity to see ' @entity33 ' - stunning meteors that come in close to the horizon to the east and west			1
but , this year , a bright moon could spoil the views for some star gazers , and astronomers are advising people to stand in a position where the moon is blocked by a building or a tree			1
astronomers predict the meteor shower will peak on 3 january at 9pm est ( 4 january at 2am gmt )			1
to view the meteor shower , people living in the northern latitudes will need to look towards ' kite formation ' in the constellation @entity48 before the shower 's peak			1
those in the eastern part of @entity54 are expected to get the best views with the shower peaking there before dawn on january 4th			0
the @entity1 shower will be at an approximate right angle with the @entity12 and @entity60			1
' in fact , the @entity1 might be the strongest and most famous major meteor shower that you 've never seen , ' @entity61 said in a separate report			2
to view the meteor shower , people living in the northern latitudes will need to look towards ' kite formation ' in the constellation @entity48 before the shower 's peak			1
' look towards the @entity74 and the seven famous stars known as @entity12 ( or ' @entity12 ' ) which collectively resemble a saucepan , ' @entity70 , astronomer and author of ' @entity72 in @entity73 ' told @entity77			0
' cast your eyes wide around the pan 's handle and you should spot fleeting shards of bright light streaking by			0
' these meteors are caused when our planet ploughs through a trail of cosmic rubbish strewn across the solar system by passing comets			0
when this dust impacts our atmosphere it incinerates , resulting in flashes of light			0
' those in the eastern part of @entity54 are expected to get the best views with the shower peaking there before dawn on 4 january			2
the @entity1 shower will be at an approximate right angle with the @entity12 and @entity60			2
the @entity1 derive their name from the constellation of @entity107 - mural quadrant - which was created by the @entity109 astronomer @entity108 in 1795			0
@entity110 was an early astronomical instrument used to observe and plot stars			0
even though the constellation is no longer recognised by astronomers , it was around long enough to give the meteor shower - first seen in 1825 - its name			0
the @entity1 shower is one of the year 's most spectacular events , but also the shower that most astronomers miss because it 's very brief and intense this year , a bright moon could also spoil the views for some star gazers , and astronomers are advising people to stand in a position where the moon is blocked by a building or a tree like the @entity130 , the @entity1 originate from an asteroid , called 2003 @entity132			1
studies suggest that this body could very well be a piece of a comet which broke apart several centuries ago , and that the meteors you will see before dawn are the debris from this fragmentation			0
after hundreds of years orbiting the sun , they will enter our atmosphere at 90,000 mph ( 144,800 km / h ) , burning up 50 miles ( 80km ) above @entity147 's surface			0
' the @entity1 can be spectacular because the number of possible meteors is comparable to two of the best meteor showers of the year - the perseids and the @entity130 , ' mr @entity70 said			1
' however , its peak does n't last as long - hours not days - so you 'll need a healthy dose of luck and good timing to catch this year 's @entity1			1
' the @entity160 shower is the next major meteor shower after the @entity1 , and is expected between april 16 to 25			0
to view the meteor shower , people living in the northern latitudes will need to look towards ' kite formation ' in the constellation @entity48 before the shower 's peak			1
the @entity1 shower will be at an approximate right angle with the @entity12 and @entity60 the @entity1 derive their name from the constellation of @entity107 - mural quadrant - which was created by the @entity109 astronomer @entity108 in 1795			2
pictured is a meteor from the shower in 2009			0

shower will peak on 3 january at 9pm est ( 4 january at 2am gmt )
it can be seen in the northern latitudes by looking towards @entity12
astronomers predict it could produce as many as 100 meteors per hour
the @entity1 event is one of the year 's most spectacular showers , but also the one that most astronomers miss because it 's brief and intense
this year , a bright moon could also *hamper* *attempts* to see the meteors
