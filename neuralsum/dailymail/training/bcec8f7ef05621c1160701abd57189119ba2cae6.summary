@entity0 - the son of @entity6 , who competed in 83 grands prix between 1983 and 1989 - clinched the championship in style with victory in the feature race at @entity13 's @entity12 on saturday			1
it was the 23 - year - old 's fourth win of the season , and 11th podium of his fourth campaign in @entity5 , and now there is only one goal			1

' the first priority was to win @entity5 , and i was always confident if i did win @entity5 i was going to be in @entity1			1
' now that 's done and i 'm confident i 'll be in @entity1			2
i 'm not saying it is going to be easy , but this title is a big help			0
' we 're going to have to wait for a few weeks and see what happens , but i feel ready for it			0
i 'm driving at the top of my game right now			0
' gp2 is the perfect series to feed into @entity1 - the same tyres , the same tracks , the cars are even now a similar speed , especially into the corners			2
' i feel absolutely ready for it and i am confident it can happen			0
' @entity0 insists he is ' absolutely ready ' to step up and compete at the highest level @entity47 2005 @entity3 2006 @entity48 2007 @entity49 2008 pastor @entity50 @entity51 2011 @entity0 is the 10th @entity5 champion since @entity1 's feeder series began in 2005 , and of the previous nine , six have graduated to the upper echelon of motorsport			1

we barely made any mistakes			0

' @entity71 motorsport could be celebrating a double triumph in @entity13 this weekend as 21 - year - old @entity73 is on the brink of being crowned @entity76 champion			0
