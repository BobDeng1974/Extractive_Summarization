by the time the most calamitous , catastrophic and cursed @entity5 debut ever to feature in @entity7 ’s worst nightmares had come to a shuddering anti-climax , victorious @entity1 rookies @entity2 and @entity3 were six under par. that ’s not a bad better - ball score for 14 holes			1
certainly far too good for a @entity14 pairing who played just about well enough to be six under fives for their truncated round			2
give @entity7 another hundred burls around @entity19 and he ’ll probably never turn in such a tight and tension - ridden show of unimpressive scoring			1
give him a partner like @entity24 – the @entity24 of yesterday , not @entity26 past – and even his best performance might not be enough			1
@entity7 made a shocking @entity5 debut on friday as he froze under the pressure of the occasion partner @entity24 was unable to salvage anything for @entity14 on friday morning , and performed poorly against a couple of @entity1 first - timers who should have been standing on that first tee with everything from toenails to split ends clenched under the strain of the situation , the local hero and * the * hero of so many @entity14 triumphs were found more than wanting			1
their round started with @entity7 finding the bunker , the hazard and then the run - off area behind the green before picking up – and ended with the unforgivable sight , very nearly an unpardonable sin , of @entity24 leaving short a birdie putt that would have at least extended the match to the 15th tee			1
beaten ? @entity7 and @entity24 were pulverised by the accuracy of @entity2 and the clutch putting of @entity3 , the self - styled world top five player who backed up his big mouth with some really impressive play in a 5 & 4 away win			1
@entity7 denied that he felt the pressure of the occasion but admitted it took him a while to hit his stride @entity24 comes out of a bunker on the third on friday but could ultimately do little to help @entity14 and yet , on a day that had begun in an atmosphere described by @entity7 as ‘ euphoric ’ , the @entity1 did n’t need to play like the next @entity72 - @entity71 partnership in order to get the points			1
they were never under pressure			2
@entity24 could offer only consolation and hope to his crestfallen partner afterwards , reminding him that his own unhappy debut – a 4 & 3 fourballs beating , in the company of @entity82 , by @entity83 and @entity84 – did n’t do him any long - term harm			1
‘ i said to @entity89 walking off the golf course today that , when i played with @entity82 in 2004 , we had our butts kicked the first time i ever played - and obviously we ’ve had that today , ’ said the @entity86 , who suffered only his fourth loss in 16 @entity5 matches			2
‘ but you know what , things can change very quickly and we have to keep our heads up right now			2
it did n’t quite work for us on the golf course but we have to look forward to the matches we ’re going to play ahead			2
‘ this is a tricky golf course and tricky conditions			0
i do n’t think the scores are as low as what some people are expecting out there			0
so we have to stay focused , be strong as a team and go out there and deliver			0
’ both men will need to improve drastically if they ’re to contribute			0
from the off , with @entity7 looking even more pale than usual , they simply struggled to get to grips with their games , their opponents and the occasion			1
@entity1 captain @entity114 congratulates @entity3 after he and @entity2 beat @entity24 and @entity7 from the moment @entity24 lipped out a short putt on the first , they were in trouble			1
@entity7 birdied the par - five second , enough for a half , but he did n’t contribute again until they were three down – and his missed birdie chance on the eighth , following his first really excellent iron shot of the day , felt like a turning point			1
watched by his mum , dad and son @entity126 , @entity7 was really struggling			1
he got little help from @entity24 , who followed a perfect drive on the par - five ninth by clunking his approach shot into the middle of the water ; it was n’t even close			1
with both @entity2 and @entity3 having looks at birdie , it was no surprise when the @entity136 went four up			1
they were five ahead after 10 , @entity2 draining one from 12 feet , and six clear when @entity3 made birdie on the 11th			1
at least @entity7 pulled a hole back on 12 , a par enough to win the hole , but he missed a good chance to eat further into the deficit on the next , sliding a 10 - footer past			2
@entity24 ( left ) and @entity7 come to terms with the comprehensive defeat handed out to them on friday the end came on the 14th green , watched by @entity150 and @entity151 , who were hanging around after having their own pairing dismantled on that very green a little earlier in the day			1
both @entity155 players had putts to win the hole			0
not quite the full story of the day			2
@entity7 , who had looked horribly tense for much of the day , admitted : ‘ i think there are nerves any time you play			1
it ’s just you learn to channel it and that ’s why you ’ve got pre-shot routines and things like that			0
‘ maybe a wee bit to start with			0
i did n’t feel under any pressure at all , really			0
i was really looking forward to it , and it just did n’t really pan out			0
did n’t quite play that well			0
and then when i did start to play well , i never capitalised on it by holing the putts			0
@entity1 @entity5 players @entity3 ( r ) and @entity179 celebrate their comfortable win ‘ i think your first @entity5 , obviously there ’s a bit of excitement and a bit of sort of , you do n’t really know what to expect			1
it took me maybe five or six holes to get into it			2
i was a bit out of rhythm but i would rather have the fans on you and cheering for you than not , if that ’s what you mean			0
‘ it was a special reception on the first tee , something that i definitely will remember for the rest of my life			0
it was just euphoric , really			0
it was what i expected , basically , and a bit more			0
’ @entity24 added : ‘ to walk to the first tee with @entity89 , at home for him , that was a special moment			2
he ’s going to remember that for a long time and i ’ll remember it , as well			0
it was an amazing atmosphere			0
but obviously we could n’t do our bit to get them really loud			0
’ the star of the miracle at @entity211 also talked about the @entity1 having ‘ ham and egged ’ well , a reference to their ability to dovetail			2
well , they certainly made mincemeat of our boys .			0

@entity7 and @entity24 lost against @entity1 *'s* @entity2 and @entity3 5 & 4 on friday morning
@entity7 looked nervous throughout the @entity220 opening day
the @entity222 admitted it took him five or six holes to get into his stride
