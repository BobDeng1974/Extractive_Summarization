it ’s business as usual in the world of @entity2			1
as we embark on another month , @entity3 will have themselves a new manager			1
@entity6 has all but agreed to become the next in an ever - expanding line of head coaches at @entity9			1
odds are he wo n’t last			0
not because the 49 - year - old does n’t have the skillset to reinvigorate @entity3 , far from it			1
the length of his tenure will be decided by an @entity17 hell - bent on transforming the fortunes of this massive club at breakneck speed and with regard to who he tramples in the process			0
@entity6 is expected to take permanent charge of @entity3 in the coming days @entity6 will want assurances that he can resume his job in the academy if the role does not work out @entity3 owner @entity2 appointed @entity30 last month , but sacked him after just 32 days fans in @entity32 are n’t surprised , and they ’re quite right not to be			1
@entity2 is an individual who rules with little reason			2
when the switch flicks , there is no stopping him			0
unfortunately for @entity3 they are the latest club to have flickered and sputtered under his ownership			2
to summarise what ’s happened since he took over – and not touching on the canteen staff at @entity42 getting the boot – @entity44 was afforded 70 days in charge before @entity30 lasted just six games			1
the only period of solidity this season has come under @entity6 on the back of @entity44 ’s sacking when the caretaker took 10 points from a possible 12			1
he wanted the top job but was overlooked			0
@entity54 may or may not have worked out – we will now never know			0
there were suggestions from fans that he set out not to lose games rather than attempting to win them and it could ’ve been that he was a doomed appointment from the get - go			0
@entity2 ’s failing here was not to perform due diligence			2
‘ i made a mistake with this guy			0
he ’s negative , he has a losing mentality , ’ he told the @entity71 after sacking the @entity72			0
@entity54 was appointed on a two - year deal but did not even last two months at @entity9 @entity2 has the @entity32 club 's best interests at heart but makes knee - jerk decisions all too often it beggars belief that an owner of a football club – charged with making decisive action after getting it so wrong with @entity85 – was not already aware of the sort of football @entity54 would be bringing with him			1
@entity2 has his club ’s best interests at heart - that has n’t been questioned by supporters - in a similar vein to the much - maligned @entity93 ’s at @entity94			1
that much is clear ; so too is the illogical decision - making			0
the 58 - year - old ’s chief difficultly is an inability to think before reaching the sort of verdicts which could plunge @entity3 into really serious trouble			1
what if @entity103 - a man @entity2 clearly did n't fancy to begin with - does n't carry on where he left off ? there could be another p45 on its way			2
@entity3 ' loss to @entity109 at the weekend was the final straw for @entity2 , who sacked @entity54 afterwards @entity111 reacts while watching the game alongside @entity6 , who he will appoint permanently former @entity115 boss @entity114 is alleged to have been sacked by @entity2 for eating a four - kilo sea bass @entity114 is said to have been spotted by @entity2 eating the fish in a clubhouse at @entity115 's training base after all , this is the same man who is alleged to have sacked a boss at @entity115 for eating sea bass			1
in a quote dug up by @entity125 in the @entity126 on tuesday , @entity114 said years after his dismissal in 2002 : ‘ he always says he has just cause [ for sacking a manager ]			0
in my case he said that he had seen me in a clubhouse at the training ground eating a four - kilo sea bass			0
there is simply no talking to a man who relieves someone of their livelihood on the back of eating an obscene amount of fish			0
@entity3 must hope that his impulses are lucky guesses from now on .			2

@entity6 is poised to become @entity3 ' manager on a permanent basis
the 49 - year old has been caretaker manager at @entity3 four times *previously*
@entity2 sacked @entity30 just 32 days after appointing him
