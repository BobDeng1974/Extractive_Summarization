on his radio show friday , @entity0 used rape as a means to explain the bill to listeners			1
controversial comparison : @entity0 started controversy today when he used a rape analogy to explain filibuster reform to his radio show listeners ' let 's forget the @entity20 for a minute , ' @entity0 said			1
he asked viewers to imagine a room with six men and four women			2
he says that the group has a rule that men can not rape women			1
the group also has a rule that requires six votes to change any rule			1
' every not and then , some lunatic in the group proposes to change the rule to allow women to be raped			2
but they were never able to get six votes for it			1
there were always the four women voting against it and they always found two guys			2
' well , the guy that kept proposing that women be raped finally got tired of it , and he was in the majority and he was the one that [ said ] , " you know what ? we 're going to change that rule			0
now all we need is five			0
" the women protest , but the man responds that they have the power to do it , because ' we 're the majority '			0
filibuster reform : president @entity5 is currently supporting an effort to lower the required votes on judicial and executive nominees ' can the women be raped ? ' @entity0 asks			1
' well all it would take then is half of the room			0
you can change the rule to say three you can change the rule to say three people want it , it 's going to happen			0
' a negative reaction to @entity0 's statements immediately started popping up on @entity73 from politicians like @entity76 chairwoman @entity75 to journalists like the @entity79 's @entity78			0
this is n't the first time the conservative talking head has offended women with his politics			1
in 2012 , @entity0 called law student @entity85 a ' slut ' and a ' prostitute ' after she testified at a hearing about contraception			0
he later apologized for his statements			0
but in response to today 's statements , @entity0 's reps were less than conciliatory			2
' @entity0 has spent 25 years illustrating absurdity by using extrapolated analogies , ' a spokesman told the @entity97			0
' anyone who calls this anything different than that is simply lying			0
