a gadget that alerts speeding drivers when emergency vehicles are nearby was last night facing calls by police and motoring organisations to be banned			1
the £ 999 @entity6 is a dashboard - mounted device which , astonishingly , is perfectly legal , according to its makers			1
it can detect when police cars – even unmarked vehicles – are more than half a mile away by picking up encoded radio signals , and then sends a warning to the motorist			1
when a 999 vehicle is within 1,200 yards , it sets off a green light on the display			0
as it gets nearer , the lights go to amber and finally they go red when it is just yards away			2
the device can even detect the radio signals from police officers on the beat and force helicopters			1
but last night @entity37 commissioner @entity36 called for them to be banned			1
he said : ‘ this device is a passport to villainy and there is no legitimate reason for a law - abiding person to have one			1
the sellers are being very naive if they believe that they will be used to reduce accidents			0
‘ a criminal will carry out a drug deal , see a light on their dashboard and then ditch their illegal stash , only to pick it up when the police are n’t around – or a motorist will be speeding on the motorway , an alert will pop up and they ’ll slow down			1
’ devices that detect the position of speed cameras are legal for use on @entity31 roads			2
several years ago , legislation was proposed to make detectors with radar and laser illegal , but the ban did not go ahead			0
the @entity68 took a red @entity69 fitted with the device for a test drive on friday with @entity28 , the managing director of @entity29			2
the device ’s aerial was concealed behind the car ’s rear - view mirror while its control box was hidden in the glovebox			1
the led alert panel was mounted next to the car ’s controls			0
as we pulled out of the firm ’s @entity84 headquarters , the device automatically started registering two lights out of five			2
mr @entity28 said it was likely that it had been set off by the @entity90 officers , who are stationed close to his office			0
as we drove along the street , the panel ’s lights flashed again – this time the cause was a traffic warden			0
the @entity98 ( pictured ) uses different coloured lights to warn of police cars ' proximity its @entity31 distributor claims it will prevent accidents by altering motorists to emergency vehicles rushing to the scene of accidents the @entity6 emits a beep when a vehicle is within range and a double - beep if the radio is transmitting data – meaning that emergency service personnel are talking over the radio			1
we parked near to ambulances at @entity117 and all five lights lit up			0
mr @entity28 said : ‘ there have been times when i ’ve stopped at traffic lights and the @entity122 starts going off but i ca n’t see any other vehicles			2
i have then driven off and seen a police car behind a bush			0
’ mr @entity28 denied there was potential for the devices to be used for criminal activity			0
he said : ‘ if anything , these devices are a criminal prevention tool			0
if you are planning to carry out a crime where there are emergency vehicles and the device is going off then you would n’t dare go through with it			1
’ but @entity138 , vice-chairman of the @entity139 , said : ‘ we have grave concerns about any product that may be used to compromise police officers ’ or public safety			0
’ @entity145 spokesman @entity144 added : ‘ the only person who will have one of these fitted to their cars is the type of person who is trying to dodge the law			2

the dashboard - mounted @entity6 picks up encoded radio signals
it can detect police cars , *including* unmarked vehicles , half a mile away
the device uses coloured lights according to warn of police cars ' proximity
but crime commissioner @entity36 has called for device to be banned
he said there was no legitimate reason for a law - abiding *citizen* to own one
