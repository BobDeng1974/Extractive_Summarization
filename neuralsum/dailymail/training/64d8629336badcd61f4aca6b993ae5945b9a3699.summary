by @entity0 published : 04:46 est , 2 june 2013 updated : 05:49 est , 15 july 2013 major food companies are ' hoodwinking ' shoppers by naming products after ingredients that are n't even in the packet , an investigation has found			2
beef and @entity9 , @entity11 ’s chicken rice and @entity13 bacon - flavour bits are just some of the big brands which fake their meat content to entice consumers			1
instead , manufacturers create phoney meat flavouring using lumps of soya protein , yeast extract and powdered vegetables			1
one popular product even achieves its meaty appearance by colouring their food with crushed insects			2
but an investigation conducted for @entity29 by leading consumer activist @entity30 found that nearly all of this information was buried on the back of the packet where shoppers are often too busy to look			2
not what it says on the tin : some of the big brands that name their food after meat that 's not even in the packet			1
but what do they use instead ? find out below ... with the recent horse meat scandal making many people sensitive about what 's in their food , campaigners now want firms to be more honest with their packaging			1
mr @entity30 , founder of the can i eat it ? barcode scanning app and website , said : ' they ’re not breaking any rules – but there are calls for clearer labelling to stop shoppers from being caught out			2
' the information 's all there on the back of the pot , but not on the front - and that ’s the part facing busy shoppers			1
' his supermarket survey found all @entity66 and @entity9 , @entity67 and @entity68 could be eaten by a vegetarian as they contain soya pieces and artificial @entity72 flavourings			1
even @entity13 bacon - flavour bits have come nowhere near a pig			1
they are instead fashioned out of textured vegetable protein			2
and the bacon - style colour is achieved by a little - known ingredient called carmine or @entity80 , a red dye made from the crushed bodies of beetles which may well be an unpalatable addition for many consumers , particularly vegetarians			1
major food companies are ' hoodwinking ' shoppers by naming products after ingredients that are n't in the packet meanwhile , a pack of bacon - flavoured , rasher - shaped @entity91 could also be enjoyed by non-meat eaters because they get their taste from smoke flavouring and flavour enhancers			2
mr @entity30 says companies can get round the law by using the term ' flavour ' on their products , but claims these are often in obscure places or hidden in the small print			2
commenting on the findings , @entity105 , head of communications for @entity107 , said : ' it ’s important for everybody to know what ’s in their food and it ’s surprising how few people really do know what they ’re eating			1
' vegetarians probably know more about ingredient lists than most consumers - indeed , that ’s why many of us are vegetarians			1
' however , we can all be caught out by misleading terms and it ’s certainly a shame if vegetarians miss out on foods that they could enjoy because manufacturers believe that there are marketing benefits in the terms like " beefy " or " chicken flavour "			1
' @entity133 , vegetarian judge for @entity134 , said : ' if i can eat these products , i want to know about it			0
' unfortunately , for the veggie shopper that " suitable for vegetarians " logo is often pretty well hidden			0
' when products do n’t contain the thing they ’re supposed to taste of , food brands do n’t like to shout about it			1
' shopper @entity145 , 56 , from @entity146 , told @entity29 : ' i think consumers are being hoodwinked by mislabelling of products			1
' it ’s just chemicals that are made to taste like the real thing - but they ’re allowed to get away with it as long as they use the word ‘ flavour ’			1
' and we ’re being gullible enough to believe it			0
some people do n’t look beyond the label			0
' here , mr @entity30 gives his verdict on some of the main offenders ...			0
@entity165 flavour bits and @entity91 are just two of the so - called ' meaty ' products that do not actually contain any meat @entity169 bacon flavour bits main ingredients : soyabean flour , sunflower oil , @entity175 , flavourings , colours ( @entity179 extract and carmine )			2
@entity181 's verdict : ' they are just textured vegetable protein and meaty insects in the colour			0
' most shoppers have no idea when the ingredient list display colour as carmine or @entity80 - that it is a red dye made from the powdered bodies of the cochineal insects			0
' manufacturers should stop hiding unpalatable information behind e-numbers or secondary names that do n’t mean a jot to 99.9 per cent of shoppers / consumers			2
' ' it would be more honest for food manufacturers to say : colour from cochineal insects – the shopper would then be left in no doubt whether to leave it on the shelf or put it in the trolley			0
' @entity209 : ' we have clearly labelled our product " @entity216 " to avoid any ambiguity and all ingredients are listed on the back of the pack			0
' @entity80 is a safe , natural and well - established food colouring			0
' @entity218 main ingredients : @entity220 , vegetable oil , bacon flavour ( lactose from milk ) , flavour enhancers including monosodium glutamate , yeast extract , rusk , smoke flavouring , colour ( paprika extract , beetroot red ) @entity181 's verdict : ' these crispy bacon frazzles fake their bacon flavour with milk , the dreaded flavour enhancer monosodium glutamate ( @entity72 ) , hydrolysed @entity240 protein and smoke flavouring			0
' they colour them with paprika extract and beetroot red			0
surely , real bacon would be a healthier option ! ' @entity247 : not yet responded to request for comment			0
' there is no indication on the front label that these @entity9 do not contain chicken or beef , ' says mr @entity30 , although they do both have ' flavour ' written in a smaller font on the packaging @entity259 main ingredients : @entity259 : noodles ( 47 % ) , wheat flour , vegetable oil , salt , vegetables ( 4.8 % ) , mushroom ( 1.6 % ) , onions , sweetcorn ) beef : noodles ( 47 % ) , for the sauce and vegetables : water , tomato ( 8 % ) , vegetables ( 6.6 % ) ( @entity276 , @entity277 , peas ) , dried glucose syrup , wheat flour , soya pieces ( texturised ) ( 2.8 % ) @entity181 's verdict : ' there is no indication on the front label that these @entity9 do not contain chicken or beef – not helpful for the time pressed – vegetarian shopper ' what @entity288 : ' @entity9 has been vegetarian since it launched back in 1977			1
' we have made a number of improvements to @entity9 over the last few years and as a result we have considerably reduced the salt content			1
' contrary to popular belief , there are no artificial colours or preservatives in a @entity9 with all flavours being 100 % suitable for vegetarians – something which is clearly labelled on pack			1
' @entity303 flavour rice ... but not chicken @entity11 's @entity305 chicken flavour rice main ingredients : @entity309 , sweetcorn , red peppers , carrots , sunflower oil , natural flavouring , onion powder , roasted onion paste @entity181 's verdict : ' @entity317			1
most shoppers would assume that this chicken - flavoured rice would have had least seen a chicken in some way or other ! ' should say on the front : suitable for vegetarians , but it contains garlic , onions and yeast extract – some shoppers have an intolerance or want to avoid these			0
' @entity330 ( @entity331 ) says : did not respond to request for comment			0
@entity335 and @entity336 it 's certainly no surf and turf : neither @entity340 or @entity341 crisps contain any meat @entity343 main ingredients : potatoes , sunflower oil , rapeseed oil , prawn cocktail seasoning			2
prawn cocktail seasoning contains : flavouring , sugar , glucose , salt , citric acid , potassium chloride , dried yeast , dried onion @entity181 's verdict : @entity359 ? so where are the prawns ? if a chef served up a prawn cocktail without the prawns they ’d be complaints a plenty ! ' it would be helpful for the shopper if " suitable for vegetarians " was displayed on the front label , which these fake prawn cocktail crisps are ! ' @entity247 : did not respond to request for comment			0
@entity336 main ingredients : @entity220 ( whole maize kernels ) , sunflower oil , bbq rib flavour ( onion powder , paprika extract ) @entity181 's verdict : ' the @entity381 flavour has never seen a rib			0
that 's why it can be labelled " suitable for vegetarians " on the back label ! it would be helpful for the shopper if it was displayed on the front label			0
' @entity391 ( @entity392 ) says : not yet responded to request for comment .			0

@entity9 , @entity11 ’s and @entity13 are some of the brands faking their meat content to entice consumers
