for months archaeologists have speculated about who lies within an ancient burial mound in northern @entity3			1
now analysis of the skeleton discovered in an underground vault has revealed that the person who was buried there was male and was probably an important general			1
he was of medium height with pale skin and brown or red hair , they said , suggesting that the remains could could well belong to blue - eyed king			1
analysis of the skeleton discovered in an underground vault has revealed the man buried there was of medium height , with pale skin and brown or red hair ( illustrated ) @entity22 was reputed to have had blue eyes and golden or red hair			1
further examination of the remains are expected to confirm that the man originated in the @entity29 region in north east @entity3 , according to the @entity3 reporter			1
skeletal remains show the man buried in the @entity34 tomb was of medium height with pale skin and brown or red hair			1
he must have been of high social status , based on his opulent final surroundings			0
archaeologists say he was probably an important general , although because the tomb was looted in antiquity , no shield or sword have been found , which were typically buried with @entity43 warriors			1
experts are studying the bones to reveal what the man died of and what he ate			1
last week , @entity3 's culture ministry said the opulence of the tomb indicates that a ' distinguished public figure ' was buried there			1
one contemporaneous account says his hair was ' xanth ' - meaning ' golden ' or ' auburn ' - and a mosaic at @entity58 shows the warrior king with red hair			0
however , other @entity62 writers said it was dark blonde , such as roman rhetoric teacher @entity65 , who wrote : ' ... his hair curled naturally and was yellow '			0
another expert said that the bones will reveal details about the man ’s health and his diet			2
@entity74 , head of the @entity76 excavation believes that the man was an important general , although because robbers have removed valuable items in antiquity , no weapons or precious objects remain in situ			1
but experts have hypothesised about how the grave would have looked at the time of burial			0
solving a mystery : last week , archaeologists found skeletal remains inside a grave in the innermost chamber of an ancient tomb in @entity34 , north @entity3			1
there has been great speculation in recent months whom the opulent burial belongs to @entity95 , professor of classical archaeology at the @entity97 , said : ‘ thanks to the elements we [ have obtained ] from other @entity43 graves , in which there was no human intervention after the burial , we can assume that we would have found armaments - a shield , sword , chest armour , helmet , shin guards and other items - and ceremonial containers made of gold or copper , chaplet and probably earthenware pottery			1
’ some commentators sill hold out hope that the skeleton belongs to @entity22 himself , based on the warrior king 's symbol being found inside the tomb			2
however , @entity122 has n't mentioned the symbol or the chances of the bones being the legendary warrior 's			0
@entity22 died in @entity127 , present day @entity128 , but his burial site remains unknown			2
some written accounts of the ancient leader 's appearance say that he had red , or strawberry blonde hair , raising hopes that the skeleton may be his			0
one contemporaneous account says his hair was ' xanth ' which means golden or auburn and a mosaic at @entity58 shows the warrior king with red hair			0
however , other @entity62 writers said it was dark blonde , such as roman rhetoric teacher @entity65 , who wrote : ' ... his hair curled naturally and was yellow '			0
experts will analyse the bones and attempt to see if dna of the man matches that of the @entity151 , @entity22 ’s father			1
however , this may be difficult because the king ’s dna is said to be ‘ overworked ’			0
there is conjecture on @entity157 about whether a 1999 geological survey indicates there are many more burial chambers in the grand complex , perhaps hiding more remains , meaning that even if the remains do not belong to @entity22 , the legendary leader may still lie in the mound			2
a new study of @entity167 is said to be under way to determine if experts have revealed all the site 's secrets			1
further tests will determine whether the man was a member of the ancient royal family of @entity43			1
@entity175 , secretary culture secretary , warned it will be hard to determine this and such an investigation could take around eight months			0
scientists will compare the dna of the bones to that of @entity151 , who was buried at @entity182 , but this will be difficult because the genetic material is ' overworked , ' she told @entity185			2
the bones of @entity189 - father of @entity22 - were burnt and because dna tests were carried out some 50 years ago , it is feared the results may have been contaminated			1
there is much conjecture on @entity157 as to whether the tomb might belong to @entity22 or whether it is a massive complex , of which only one chamber has been discovered			1
some @entity157 users have spotted a symbol in the tomb that they say is the mark of the ancient leader , while others are pointing to the results of an old geological survey that hints the mound hides many underground stone structures			2
last week , @entity3 ’s @entity207 revealed that the body had been placed in a wooden coffin , which disintegrated over time			1
the skeletal remains were found both inside and outside the rectangular stone - lined cist , under the floor of the cavernous , vaulted structure that is 26 feet ( eight metres ) tall iron and bronze nails as well as carved bone and glass decorations from the coffin were also found scattered in the grave			1
findings : @entity3 's @entity122 said the skeleton was strewn in and around the stone - lined cistern , pictured , under the floor of the cavernous , vaulted structure that is 26ft tall opulent : there has been speculation that the tomb could be that of @entity22 ( a mosaic depicting the king is shown )			1
examinations of the remains have established they belong to a man who was a general new find : surviving fragments of carved bone and glass coffin ornaments found in the tomb at @entity34 , but no helmet , shield or military objects which would be expected in the tomb of a @entity43 soldier @entity22 of @entity242 was born in @entity58 , the ancient capital of @entity43 in july 356 bc. he died of a fever in @entity244 in june 323 bc. @entity22 led an army across the @entity247 territories of @entity248 , @entity249 and @entity250 claiming the land as he went			1
his greatest victory was at the @entity253 , now northern @entity128 , in 331 @entity254 , and during his trek across these @entity247 territories , he was said to never have suffered a defeat			0
this led him to be known as @entity22			0
following this battle in @entity253 , @entity22 led his army a further 11,000 miles ( 17,700km ) , founded over 70 cities and created an empire that stretched across three continents			0
this covered from @entity3 in the west , to @entity250 in the south , @entity266 in the north , and @entity269 @entity268 to the @entity270			2
@entity22 was buried in @entity250 , but it is thought his body was moved to prevent looting			0
his fellow royals were traditionally interred in a cemetery near @entity182 , far to the west			0
the lavishly - furnished tomb of @entity22 's father , @entity278 , was discovered during the 1970s			2
archaeologists in the past have said the grave likely belonged to a prominent @entity43 and some had hoped it might have been built for @entity22 's mother or wife , while others predicted it belongs to a military man			2
last week the @entity122 said in a statement : ' it is probably the monument of a dead person who became a hero , meaning a mortal who was worshipped by society at that time			0
' the deceased was a prominent person , since only this could explain the construction of this unique burial complex			0
' ‘ it is an extremely expensive construction , whose cost , clearly , is unlikely to have been borne by a private citizen			0
' @entity304 , a professor of archaeology at the @entity97 who has not been involved with the dig , said the human remains should provide valuable information on the occupant of the tomb , which at about 49 ft ( 15 metres ) long and 15 ft ( 4.5 metres ) wide is one of the biggest ever found in the country			2
he believes one possible candidate could be @entity315 , one of @entity22 's closest aides who led his fleet back from @entity269 to modern @entity128 , and who grew up in @entity34			0
the ministry confirmed fears that the tomb had been thoroughly and repeatedly plundered during antiquity			0
‘ whatever objects of value the first thieves missed was taken by others later , ’ professor @entity304 said			0
excavations at the site in northeastern @entity3 near the city of @entity331 began in 2012			2
they captured global attention in august when archaeologists announced the discovery of vast tomb guarded by two sphinxes and circled by a 497 - metre marble wall			0
since then the tomb has also yielded a mosaic made of coloured pebbles depicting the abduction of @entity343 , the daughter of @entity345 , as well as two sculpted female figures also known as @entity347			0
the tomb dates to 300 - 325 b.c. @entity22 died in 323 b.c. after a military campaign through the @entity270 , @entity248 and northeast @entity350			0
experts believe the ancient mound , situated around 65 miles ( 100km ) from @entity331 ( shown on the map ) was built for a prominent @entity43 in around 300 to 325 @entity254 clockwise from top right shows two headless , marble sphinxes found above the entrance to the barrel - vaulted tomb , details of the facade and the lower courses of the blocking wall , the antechamber 's mosaic floor , a 4.2 - metre long stone slab , and the upper uncovered sections of two female figures			1
the second and third chambers , not pictured , have not yet been explored headcase : one of the shows the broken - off head 's from one of the large marble sphinxes that decorate the entrance to the tomb beautiful : a large , damaged mosaic floor of the ancient @entity3 god of the underworld , @entity380 , abducting the goddess @entity343 on a horse - drawn chariot as the god @entity385 looks on , found in the tomb			1

last week bones were found in @entity3 tomb dating from the @entity390
analysis shows they belong to a man of medium height who had pale skin
experts think he was probably an important @entity43 general
dna tests will determine if the man was a member of the royal family
carved bone and glass coffin ornaments were discovered near the bones
*amphipolis* site is largest ancient tomb to have been discovered in @entity3
skeletal remains are being examined for further identification
