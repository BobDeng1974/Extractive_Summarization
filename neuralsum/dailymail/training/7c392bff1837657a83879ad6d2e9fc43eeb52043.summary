after what had been a difficult start to his tenure at @entity4 , @entity5 could have reflected on beating @entity6 2 - 1 with some satisfaction			1
his team had climbed into the @entity11 ’s top four and they had done so thanks to a first @entity4 goal for @entity13			1
but @entity14 looked as deflated as the punctured tyre that disrupted his departure from the training ground a few days earlier — and understandably so			2
just as he knew a team attacking with more confidence would have exploited what remains an alarming imbalance in his side			0
he is trying to address the issue with his calls for a more collective approach to defending , and for 45 minutes of an entertaining match he probably felt his players were pretty much following his instructions			0
but when only @entity47 now stand between back - to - back encounters with @entity49 and @entity50 , significant progress still needs to be made			1
@entity14 's side might well have drawn or even lost against @entity6 were it not for @entity20 's heroics @entity4 are scoring plenty of goals , with @entity13 opening his account against @entity57 's side , but it 's defensively where there are concerns ‘ we have to improve a lot of things , ’ was one of the first statements the @entity25 made in a series of post-match interviews , even if he did then offer a more positive spin when he suggested the fact that they had risen to fourth playing badly was a cause for optimism			1
but his initial point was correct because @entity4 need to improve on an awful lot , in particular across a back four that remains alarmingly fragile			1
this was only @entity29 ’s second competitive appearance for @entity4 but he managed to demonstrate the best and worst aspects of his game in the 70 minutes he played prior to leaving the field with a knee injury			2
@entity82 and @entity83 have played well at times but both struggled in the 5 - 3 defeat by @entity86 if @entity29 oozed class going forward , he proved such a liability in defence that it was easy to see why @entity91 would rather see him back in @entity93 ’s under 21 squad for now			2
it was not just the penalty he conceded ; a reckless challenge on @entity97			0
it was a general lack of composure whenever @entity6 attacked down his flank and the role he played — albeit a minor one compared to @entity102 — in allowing @entity103 to score his 55th - minute equaliser			2
@entity29 would do well to study his predecessors because , in @entity106 and @entity107 , @entity4 have had two left backs who mastered both aspects of a full back ’s job ; who were brilliantly effective going forward but were also key members of a superbly organised back four			2
@entity14 's defence has been weakened further by the absence of the injured @entity117 @entity118 ( right ) has impressed this season but is yet to be tested against the league 's best strikers @entity29 is still young , of course			1
but it is a concern when good defending relies so much on instinct and he will need to show he can be trusted if he wants to remain in the side once players like @entity117 are fit			0
particularly when @entity14 still has the option of @entity83 , however much that might alarm @entity4 supporters haunted by his efforts at left back earlier this season			1
a more accurate measure of @entity4 ’s strengths and weaknesses will come at home to @entity49 and away to @entity50			1
excellent on debut last week , @entity118 did a fine job in dealing with the physical presence of @entity138 on sunday			0
@entity4 take on @entity49 and @entity50 in two of their next three matches and need to be more solid but @entity138 is not of the quality of forwards @entity118 could soon be facing and that ’s where the issue of collective responsibility became more of a pressing concern for @entity14			1
@entity4 ’s back four needs to operate with more cohesion but it needs more protection , too , as the runs from deep by @entity154 and @entity155 late in this game illustrated			0
nobody was picking up @entity6 ’s substitutes and , had it not been for @entity159 , their efforts could have been extremely costly for the hosts			0
@entity164 's terrific form since joining from @entity165 has given the @entity22 club a big lift going forward , @entity4 are terrific ; as good as any team in the @entity11 and so blessed with quality that the absence of the suspended @entity171 caused little disruption			1
@entity164 continues to thrill and @entity13 is starting to prove himself quite the predator with a fine demonstration of forward play crowned by his winning goal			0
but @entity14 was not getting carried away , with his focus afterwards more on @entity164 ’s defending than the goal and the assist he produced			0
mainly because @entity4 ’s manager knows what is coming next .			0

@entity5 must improve @entity4 's defence
his side beat @entity6 2 - 1 on sunday but they owed much to @entity20
@entity4 have conceded 14 goals in eight games in all competitions
the win against @entity6 lifted @entity14 's side to 4th in the @entity11
but the @entity22 side take on @entity49 and @entity50 in two of their next three games and need to improve
