by @entity0 , @entity1 correspondent @entity3 would lose more than five per cent of its economic output if it broke away from the @entity5 , a study found yesterday			1
an international dividing line between @entity3 and @entity8 would discourage cross-border trade and cut 5.5 per cent from @entity3 gross domestic product , it said			1
the calculations - made by two of @entity3 ’s leading economists - suggest that independence would have cost the country almost £ 8 billion in 2012			1
the huge fall in wealth creation would occur as an automatic result of setting up a border , the study claimed			1
@entity3 would lose more than five per cent of its economic output if it broke away from the @entity5 , experts have claimed			2
@entity3 will vote in the referendum over whether they stay as part of @entity5 in september further losses caused by independence could then include major companies fleeing an independent @entity3 , or higher interest rates as a result of the potential loss of the pound			1
the projections will further inflame the fierce debate over economic impact of independence that has become the central argument in advance of the september independence referendum			0
the new assessment is based on an analysis of the way international borders suppress trade to a greater extent than regional boundaries which run inside countries			2
dr @entity46 of @entity47 - who is currently working for the @entity48 on improving economic forecasting - and professor @entity50 of @entity51 looked at the effect on trade of the border between the @entity5 and @entity55			0
@entity55 , they said was ‘ the country with which the @entity5 has the lowest measured trade frictions			2
’ they also examined the borders between @entity62 and @entity63 ; the @entity64 , @entity65 , and @entity66 ; and inside the @entity51			0
their report , presented to the @entity70 conference in @entity71 , said that international borders ‘ impede trade flows ’			1
the study , by @entity3 's two leading economists , backs the case for @entity3 staying part of the @entity5 , as advocated by @entity78 mp ( second left )			1
an international border between @entity3 and @entity8 would discourage trade and cut 5.5 per cent from @entity3 gdp reasons why include the way service industries tend to operate mainly inside their own countries , and people ’s preference for buying from their own national companies rather than foreign competitors , the study said			1
‘ national borders impede trade flows much more strongly than do the borders between regions within a country , ’ the report said			1
‘ the scale of the difference between national and regional borders is such that there may be significant welfare or productivity effects from removing borders between countries , or conversely from creating borders within existing nation states			0
’ it added : ‘ sharing a nation state produces a substantially higher degree of economic integration than even a very close trading relationship between independent countries			0
’ @entity3 nationalists have denounced chancellor @entity115 's threat to without the pound as bullying the ‘ friction ’ in trade between economically developed countries and @entity51 member countries is ‘ significantly higher ’ than the drag on trade by borders between @entity64 states , @entity65 provinces or @entity62 regions , the report said			2
if @entity3 were to trade only internally - so that @entity3 companies did business only with other @entity3 firms - that would cost @entity3 16.3 per cent of its economic output , the economists calculated			1
setting up an international border with the @entity5 would cost @entity3 more than a quarter of what it would lose by abolishing foreign trade entirely , they said			1
the two economists said their estimates were ‘ on the conservative side ’ and that losses could be greater because ‘ part of the border effect is due to a large degree of home bias in services trade			0
’ they added that part of the reason for losses if a border is created is that inefficient and mediocre companies would find it easier in @entity3			2
‘ @entity153 firms that would find it impossible to survive when facing direct competition from the rest of a larger country , would find it profitable to survive in the independence scenario			0
this is because they are sheltered from more intense competition			0
‘ unproductive but local firms find themselves in a better competitive position , and the access more of what is now a captive market			0
’ rows over the future of @entity3 ’s economy have come to dominate the arguments between yes and no camps in the run - up to the 18 september referendum			0
nationalists have denounced as bullying the warning by chancellor @entity115 , backed by @entity179 and @entity180 leaders , that the pound will not be shared with an independent @entity3			0
while the yes camp says a @entity5 government would inevitably do a deal on the pound , and an anonymous leak suggests one @entity187 minister agrees , losing the pound threatens @entity3 with high interest rates or loss of control of its own currency			0
there have also been a series of warnings from major companies that they would shift headquarters out of @entity3 if independence came .			2

two of @entity3 's leading economists calculated the cost of independence
study found breaking away from @entity8 would cost £ *8bn*
international diving line would discourage cross-border trade
huge fall in wealth creation would occur if @entity3 vote to leave @entity5
further losses could include major companies fleeing the country
report said international borders ' impedes trade flows '
