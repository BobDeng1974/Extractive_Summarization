a @entity1 based anti-vaccination campaigner , whose seminars were repeatedly boycotted by @entity5 doctors and venues , has announced the cancellation of her remaining talks due to consistent threats of violence from ' anti-free - speech terrorists '			1
@entity14 was due to speak at a number of events in @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity20 and the @entity21 , however a statement posted to one of her social media accounts on wednesday , announced they had been cancelled			1
the reason cited was that a large number of violent threats , including bomb - threats , had been made against venue owners and their families			1
' the determination was made to protect the speakers , the public and the venue owners as pro-vaccine extremists have made continual , anonymous threats of vandalism and violence , ' the statement read			1
' some people were planning to bring babies			0
the threats have been persistent			2
we are not able to insure that the attendees would be safe from harm , ' ms @entity44 said			0
dr @entity14 revealed that she had also cancelled a private holiday in @entity5 due to concerns for her own personal safety			1
' i was coming to speak as an invited guest			0
however , given the level of hostility that has transpired over the last three weeks , and for the sake of my own personal safety , i have also cancelled my planned vacation in @entity5 , ' she said			1
the statement added : ' additional options are being considered but not confirmed at this time			0
a refund will be issued for all tickets sold			0
' the osteopath physician , whose seminars claim vaccinations cause autism and other health problems , said that ' continual , anonymous threats of vandalism and violence ' had been made against venue operators police are understood to be investigating the violent threats , which they said may have actually been made by anti-vaccination activists , the @entity78 reports			1
the cancellation comes just weeks after the general manager of @entity18 's @entity85 and @entity86 , @entity87 , told the @entity78 that the club had cancelled ms @entity14 's event as they did not want to be tied to the contentious issue			1
' the club as a venue , we do n't have a position for or against this , we just decided the subject matter was too controversial for us to be involved in , ' he said			2
ms @entity44 responded at the time by saying people who were against the seminars were suppressing information			2
' they say they want parents to make an informed choice , but you ca n't do that if you do n't have all the information			0
@entity108 and @entity86 ( pictured above ) was scheduled to hold one of dr @entity14 's seminars but they cancelled it earlier this month there are two change.org petitions currently still circulating in relation to dr @entity14 's now cancelled visit			1
one of them has come to the attention of the immigration minister @entity118			0
the @entity120 's @entity119 into @entity5 petition asked the department to deny the campaigner a visa , citing she was ' a danger to @entity5 children and society as a whole due to her extremist and uneducated views regarding vaccination '			1
so far , it has garnered over 7,000 signatures and a spokesman for mr @entity118 told the @entity78 he was ' taking advice on this matter and will make further comment when appropriate '			0
the other petition was started by anti-vaccine group stop the @entity139 called do not allow @entity14 to give her anti-vaccine talks in @entity5			1
people applauded the move from the club to shutdown the seminar , saying ' thank you for making the ethical decision ' while others saw the cancellation as an attack on freedom of speech it urged venues holding her seminars to cancel the events as she and other ' anti-vaccination extremists pose a severe threat to @entity5 society with their uneducated bogus claims '			1
earlier this month , dr @entity14 defended her seminars after pro-immunisation parents labelled them ' disgusting '			1
dr @entity14 said she found the backlash on social media ' curious '			2
' i planned to be in @entity5 for a holiday and was asked to speak with a few groups who are interested in discussing the pros and cons of vaccines , ' she told @entity171 via email			1
' it is curious why the public health , pro-vaccine community is so outraged over my visit and the opportunity to share information sourced from conventional medical journals			0
' if vaccines were so effective , so protective and so incredibly safe , no one would be interested in these gatherings			0
it came just days after dr @entity14 defended the seminars after pro-immunisation parents labelled them as ' disgusting ' doctors who were meant to hold a conference at @entity20 's @entity188 had also cancelled an event dr @entity14 's arrival had people outraged and sparked an online campaign to stop her from speaking ' the public health community should be willing to openly discuss they problems associated with vaccines , how to improve vaccine safety , and how to restore the health of those who have been vaccine - injured			1
' on her website , dr @entity14 writes that she believes ' vaccines can cause more harm to the health of the individual ' and is against ' a system that forces parents to inject their children , against their better judgment '			2
her views on immunisation are further demonstrated by the t - shirts sold on her site , which read : ' i did n't deny my children vaccines ... i spared them ' and ' fact : 1 in 50 = @entity220 , fact : 1 in 25,000 = unvaccinated , @entity218 '			2
her views on immunisation are further demonstrated by the t - shirts sold on her site people took to social media to express their outrage , with one pro-vaccine group starting a letter writing campaign the seminars were called @entity229 this comes after the @entity232 ruled against @entity233 , finding homeopathic vaccines were not scientifically proven to be effective , and said the health website had mislead people into thinking they could be used as a substitute for medical vaccines , @entity230 reported			2
@entity238 of @entity239 and surveillance director @entity240 told @entity171 dr @entity14 was tapping into people 's ' fear factor '			2
' when we 've got no disease to see , it 's very easy to look at something like autism - unfortunately it 's something we still do n't understand - and start to suggest it has something to do with being vaccinated			0
you can understand why people would believe that , ' he said			0
' but there are hundreds of studies that disprove that			0
' professor @entity257 added there was no scientific evidence homeopathic vaccinations protected people against infectious diseases			0
he said it was like asking someone if they wanted to be vaccinated with ' sterile water '			0
' it 's just laughable really , ' professor @entity257 said .			0

this week , she cancelled a series of talks scheduled for @entity20 , @entity19 , @entity17 , @entity21 and @entity18
the decision was made due to a number of violent threats made against venue owners and their families by ' anti-free - speech terrorists '
