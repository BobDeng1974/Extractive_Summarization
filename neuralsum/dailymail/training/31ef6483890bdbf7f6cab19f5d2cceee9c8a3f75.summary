@entity1 raiders stole all of the @entity6 @entity5 team 's trophies in a twilight raid on their @entity9 factory , but many of them are thought to be worthless replicas			1
six men used a 4x4 and a @entity13 to drive through the building 's main entrance , stealing more than 60 trophies , but a source close to the team revealed that many of them were made of plastic and of no value			1
this means that the thieves , who will not be able to sell the trophies , will also be unable to melt them down to flog off as scrap metal			2
one of the trophies that may have been stolen , a second place trophy @entity27 won at the @entity29 @entity28 , was made of recycled plastic			1
all of the awards were stolen in a ram raid on friday , but many of them are thought to be worthless replicas a picture taken at the scene shows the damage left by a 4x4 which smashed through the entrance of the factory @entity6 won the @entity46 ' championships from 2010 to 2013 , while @entity32 won the drivers ' championship for each of the four years			1
however the ram raiders , who used vehicles with foreign number plates , failed to get away with these prestigious trophies too as they had been passed on to this season 's title winners @entity13 and @entity57			1
despite many of the trophies being of little material value , team principal @entity58 said staff were ' absolutely devastated ' by the break - in on friday night , which had taken ' years of hard work to accumulate '			1
he said : ' the break - in caused significant damage and was very upsetting for our night officers who were on duty at the time			0
' the offenders took items that not only did not belong to them , but which represented the efforts of a group of dedicated , hard - working individuals			0
' beyond the aggressive nature of this break - in , we are perplexed why anyone would take these trophies			0
the value to the team is of course extraordinarily high due to the sheer hard work and effort that went into winning each and every one			0
' but their intrinsic value is low ; they would be of little benefit to those outside of the team and , in addition to that , many of the trophies on display were replicas			0
' six men used a 4x4 and a @entity13 , both with foreign number plates , to drive through the front entrance of the building @entity32 and former team mate @entity27 won a combined 43 races while they were at @entity6 from 2010 - 2013 , with @entity102 adding three more wins to the team 's total this season the team won 43 races over the four - year period , receiving a trophy for each victory , as well as four constructors ' trophies			1
former @entity6 drivers @entity32 and @entity27 also won separate trophies for finishing on the podium , as well as @entity32 's four championships , but it not known whether they were kept in the @entity9 factory or if replicas were kept instead			1
@entity102 also won three races for @entity6 this season			0
@entity58 added : ' the actions of these men mean it 's likely that we will have to make our site less accessible in the future , which will be unfair on the hundreds of fans that travel to visit our factory each year to see our trophies and our @entity5 car			2
' we would like to appeal to anyone who knows any information on the whereabouts of these trophies or the offenders involved to contact @entity138			0
' the @entity140 team won the @entity46 ' championships from 2010 to 2013 , while @entity32 won the drivers ' championship for each of the four years the team won 43 races over the four - year period , receiving a trophy for each victory , as well as the four constructors ' trophies @entity32 ( pictured on podium ) won the 2013 @entity152 after taking victory in the @entity154 @entity28 police said they were called at 1.30am this morning following the robbery and that staff were not harmed			1
a @entity160 police spokesman said : ' two cars were involved			0
a silver 4x4 which was used to drive through the entrance and a further dark coloured , black or dark blue @entity13 estate car			0
both are believed to have foreign number plates			0
' there is no description of the offenders available at this time , although they are all believed to be men , wearing dark clothing			0
' @entity6 entered @entity5 in 2005 after owner @entity172 bought the now - defunct @entity174 team			1
they won their first @entity176 points in the team 's first race as @entity180 driver @entity179 took fourth place at the @entity182 @entity28			2
@entity179 won @entity6 's first podium in the 2006 @entity184 , the same year that their sister team @entity185 entered the sport			2
surprisingly , @entity185 , the junior team , won a race before @entity6 , with 21 - year - old @entity32 becoming the youngest driver to take a victory after storming to the chequered flag in @entity191 , @entity192			2
after @entity32 's move to @entity6 , the team rose through the ranks , eventually taking the constructors ' title in 2010 after they benefited from a change in regulations			1
@entity32 and team mate @entity27 continued to dominate the sport , with the @entity201 winning the next three titles			2
the pair 's relationship became strained as @entity6 appeared to back the four - time champion over @entity27 , with the @entity182 quitting the sport at the end of 2013 to take up endurance racing with @entity209			0
@entity32 was joined at the team by @entity102 , previously of @entity185 , who won three races and looked the better driver throughout the 2014 season - which was dominated by @entity13			1
@entity216 driver @entity215 , who drove for @entity185 this season , will replace @entity32 for the 2015 season when the @entity201 joins @entity219 .			0
