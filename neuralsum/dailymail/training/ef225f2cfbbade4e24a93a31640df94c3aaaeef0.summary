incredible new images released by @entity1 show the terrifying scale and power of the @entity5 tornado as seen from space			1
the giant twister that pulverized the suburb of @entity9 on monday was up to 600 times more powerful than the atomic bomb that levelled @entity11			1
wind speed , air moisture , temperature and timing all came together to create the perfect storm , which left at least 24 dead , including nine children , and some 237 injured			1
their calculations , based on energy measured in the air and then multiplied over the size and duration of the storm , come as @entity1 released spectacular images of the fierce twister from space			1
on tuesday , the @entity56 gave it the top - of - the - scale rating of @entity59 for wind speed and breadth , and severity of damage			1
wind speeds were estimated at between 200 and 210 mph			2
the @entity66 averages about one @entity59 - 5 a year , but this was the first in nearly two years			0
levelled : wind speed , air moisture , temperature and timing all came together to create the perfect storm , which left at least 24 dead , including nine children , and some 237 injured path of destruction : the @entity56 gave the tornado a top - of - the - scale rating of @entity59 - 5 for wind speed , breadth and severity of damage			1
wind speeds were estimated at between 200 and 210mph @entity82 phenomena : the weather conditions such as the humidity and a cold downdraft had to be just right for such a powerful tornado to form , experts say to get such an uncommon storm to form is ' a bit of a @entity82 problem , ' said @entity93 meteorology professor @entity92			1
' everything has to be just right			0
' for example , there must be humidity for a tornado to form , but too much can cut the storm off			1
the same goes with the cold air in a downdraft : too much can be a storm - killer			1
but when the ideal conditions do occur , watch out			0
the power of nature beats out anything man can create			1
' everything was ready for explosive development yesterday , ' said @entity110 meteorology professor @entity109 , who was in @entity24 launching airborne devices that measured the energy , moisture and wind speeds on monday			1
' it all just unleashed on that one area			0
' an @entity59 tornado has the most violent winds on @entity119 , more powerful than a hurricane			2
the strongest winds ever measured were the 302 mph reading , measured by radar , during the @entity59 tornado that struck @entity9 on may 3 , 1999 , according to @entity124 , meteorology director at the @entity125			1
monster : meteorologists estimate the storm on monday had between eight and 600 times more energy than @entity11 dwarfed : monday 's tornado dwarfed the power of the atomic bomb , pictured , that was dropped on @entity11 , @entity43 , august 6 , 1945 still , when it comes to weather events , scientists usually know more about and can better predict hurricanes , winter storms , heat waves and other big events			1
that 's because even though a tornado like the one that struck @entity9 was 1.3 miles wide , with a path of 17 miles long , in meteorological terms it was small , hard to track , rare and even harder to study			2
so tornadoes are still more of a mystery than their hurricane cousins , even though tropical storms form over ocean areas where no one is , while this tornado formed only miles from the very @entity56 office that specializes in tornadoes			2
' this phenomenon can be so deadly you would think that something that catastrophic , that severe would lend itself to understanding , ' said @entity162 , meteorology professor at the @entity163 , @entity164			0
' but we 're fighting the inherent unpredictability of these small - scale phenomena			0
' ruins : the bomb on august 6 , 1945 left @entity11 in tatters , pictured man - made : the blast devastated the @entity43 city , however it had only a fraction of the energy of monday 's natural disaster unlike hurricanes , which forecasters can fly through in planes and monitor with buoys and weather stations , usually over a period of days , tornadoes form quickly and normally last only a matter of minutes			1
while meteorologists and television hosts chase tornadoes and try to get readings , it 's not usually enough			2
this storm lasted 40 minutes -- long for a regular tornado but not too unusual for such a violent one , said research meteorologist @entity193 at the @entity194 in @entity195 , @entity24			1
still , the conditions needed to form such a violent and devastating tornado were there and forecasters knew it , warning five days in advance that something big could happen , @entity193 said			2
by monday morning , forecasters at the @entity204 , home of the storm lab and storm prediction center , knew ' that any storm that formed in that environment had the potential to be a strong to violent tornado , ' he said			1
' this is a pretty classic setup , ' @entity193 said			0
pummeled : this aerial photo shows , from bottom to top , the path monday 's tornado took through @entity9 , @entity5 , leaving it destruction in its path flattened : the monster tornado leveled approximately 2,300 homes tornadoes have two main ingredients : moist energy in the atmosphere and wind shear			1
wind shear is the difference between wind at high altitudes and wind near the surface			1
the more moist energy and the greater the wind shear , the better the chances for tornadoes			1
but just because the conditions are right does n't mean a violent tornado will form , and scientists still do n't know why they occur in certain spots in a storm and not others , and why at certain times and not others			1
on monday , the moist energy came up from the @entity245 , the wind shear from the jet stream plunging from @entity248			1
' where they met is where the @entity9 storm got started , ' @entity193 said			2
with the third strong storm hitting @entity9 in 14 years -- and following roughly the same path as an @entity59 that killed 40 people in 1999 and an @entity59 that injured 45 others in 2003 -- some people are wondering why @entity9 ? it 's a combination of geography , meteorology and lots of bad luck , experts said			1
if you look at the climate history of tornadoes in may , you will see they cluster in a spot , maybe 100 miles wide , in central @entity24 , @entity162 said			0
that 's where the weather conditions of warm , moist air and strong wind shear needed for tornadoes combine , in just the right balance			2
' @entity24 is a hot spot and there 's a good reason for it , ' @entity162 said			0
' there 's this perfect combination where the jet stream is strong , the instability is large and the typical position for this juxtaposition climatologically is central @entity24			2
' and the timing has to be perfect			2
earlier in the year , there 's not enough warm moist air , but the jet stream is stronger			2
later , the jet stream is weaker but the air is moister and warmer			0
survivors : @entity291 , left , looks through what is remains of his home at 14716 s. @entity295 with his brother @entity296 on tuesday recovery @ a firefighter watches vehicles pass by in front of a destroyed home north of @entity302 between @entity303 and @entity304 on tuesday , may 21 , 2013 , after a tornado struck south @entity306 and @entity9 , @entity24 , on monday the hot spot is more than just the city of @entity9			1
several meteorologists offer the same explanation for why that @entity306 suburb seemed to be hit repeatedly by violent tornadoes : bad luck			0
of the 60 @entity59 tornadoes since 1950 , @entity5 and @entity314 have been struck the most , seven times each			0
more than half of these top - of - the - scale twisters are in just five states : @entity24 , @entity314 , @entity320 , @entity321 , and @entity322			0
less than 1 percent of all @entity323			0
@entity325 tornadoes are this violent -- only about 10 a year , @entity193 said			0
the @entity66 ' @entity326 is the ' best place on @entity119 ' for the formation of violent tornadoes because of geography , @entity92 said			0
you need the low pressure systems coming down off the @entity333 colliding with the warm moist unstable air coming north from the @entity245			0
scientists know the key ingredients that go into a devastating tornado			0
but they are struggling to figure out why they develop in some big storms and not others			0
they also are still trying to determine what effects , if any , global warming has on tornadoes			0
the jet stream can shift to cause a record number of tornadoes -- or an unusually low number of them			0
early research , much of it by @entity193 , predicts that as the world warms , the moist energy -- or instability -- will increase , and the @entity66 will have more thunderstorms			0
but at the same time , the needed wind shear -- the difference between wind speed and direction at different altitudes -- will likely decrease			1
the two factors go in different directions and it 's hard to tell which will win out			0
@entity193 and others think that eventually there may be more thunderstorms and fewer days with tornadoes , but more tornadoes on those days when twisters do strike			0
' @entity371 are perhaps the most difficult things to connect to climate change of any extreme , ' said @entity1 climate scientist @entity375			2
' because we still do n't understand all the factors required to get a tornado			0

wind speed , air moisture , temperature and timing all came together to create the perfect storm , which left at least 24 dead , including nine children , and some 237 injured
meteorologists estimate the tornado had eight times to more than 600 times the power of the bomb that flattened the @entity43 city during @entity44 , with more experts at the high end
calculations are based on energy measured in the air and then multiplied over the size and duration of the storm
