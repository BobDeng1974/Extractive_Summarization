by @entity1 reporter last updated at 10:47 pm on 28th june 2011 ' toothless legislation ' : @entity4 officials will be able to touch passengers ' intimate areas if they can show grounds for suspicion @entity8 has backed watered - down laws to stop @entity4 officials touching passengers inappropriately during airport searches			1
but critics have accused lawmakers of passing ' toothless ' legislation after it was severley altered to allow security officials to touch sexual organs if they have a ' reasonable suspicion '			1
the move is likely to increase anger towards intrusive searches after it emerged that 95 - year - old leukemia sufferer @entity21 was asked to remove her diaper by officials			2
the @entity8 legislation aims to criminalize intentional , inappropriate touching during airport security pat - downs			1
it would still be a misdemeanor punishable with up to a year in jail to touch a person 's sexual organs and other sensitive areas			2
but security officials will have a defence against prosecution if they act with ' reasonable suspicion ' that the search is necessary			1
that change prompted chants of ' @entity40 ! ' by a small group of protesters at the @entity43 today shortly after the @entity44 cast a preliminary vote in favor of the bill			0
degrading : @entity49 , a gravely ill 95 - year - old woman , had to remove her wet diaper at an airport so that she could be patted down by security screeners and nearly missed her flight the protesters then gathered in the @entity43 gallery and several called out ' @entity56 ! ' to senators below			0
the @entity43 passed its version several hours after the protesters left			0
the @entity61 - controlled chambers have until wednesday to resolve several differences between their bills before sending one to governor @entity65 to consider signing it into law			0
supporters of the bill complained the changes make the penalties unenforceable			0
@entity8 law already bans public servants from subjecting someone to a search he or she ' knows is unlawful '			2
about two dozen people showed up to testify in support of the bill in the @entity80 , then opposed it when they learned the bill was going to be changed on the recommendation of @entity8 attorney general @entity84 , a @entity61			0
' the simple act of opting out of the body scanners is going to be reasonable suspicion , ' said @entity88 of @entity89			1
' @entity91 , six , is searched by a @entity4 official at @entity93 one spared : @entity91 , six , is searched by a @entity4 official at @entity96 airportrleans airport senator @entity97 , @entity98 , defended the change , saying the bill still sends a strong message to @entity4 security screeners to keep their wandering hands off @entity104			1
@entity97 noted that the @entity4 announced last week that it would try to reduce the number of pat - downs performed on children			1
' the goal is to get the @entity4 to change their policy , ' @entity97 said			1
" ' @entity111 is going change their policy because @entity8 is taking the lead			0
" @entity4 spokesman @entity113 said @entity114 expect authorities to use ' effective methods to keep the traveling public safe ' and that the agency will review the bill if passed into law			1
all of the testimony for the bill has concentrated on stories of people being searched and included no actual examples of @entity4 officers being reprimanded or disciplined for improper touching			1
although dismissed last week as a ' publicity stunt ' by @entity130 house speaker @entity130 , the issue has become a top priority for the libertarian wing of the @entity133			0
outcry : a @entity4 agent watches as a woman removes her shoes to pass through the metal detector at a security checkpoint at @entity140 , @entity141 few @entity8 airports are equipped with full - body scanners , meaning there often is no other screening option for travelers picked out for what @entity4 calls an enhanced pat down			1
opponents have simmered over procedures they consider a violation of their constitutional right against unwarranted search and seizure			0
@entity8 made it a full - blown fight with the @entity4 last month when the @entity44 voted to criminalize intrusive pat - downs			1
that version appeared ready to pass the @entity43 until @entity158 , the @entity114 attorney for the @entity159 of @entity8 , warned lawmakers that it would interfere with the @entity4 's ability to ensure travelers ' safety			1
@entity158 's letter to legislators said if the original bill passed , the federal government would probably go to court to block it and the @entity4 would likely be required to cancel flights if it can not ensure passenger safety			2
@entity4 officials say advance imaging technology and pat downs are the most effective way to detect threats such as explosives made of plastics , liquids or gels designed to not be detected by traditional metal detectors			2
the issue prompted some small but loud demonstrations outside the @entity44 and @entity43 chambers last month and many of them showed up again for monday 's vote			0
@entity8 gov. @entity65 , a @entity61 considering a run for president , added the pat - down bill to the agenda of the 30 - day special session he called on may 31			0
but the bill has lost significant momentum over the last week			0
@entity130 appeared to strike a major blow against the original version of the bill when he warned it would hurt commercial aviation in @entity8 and would make the state a ' laughingstock '			0
monday 's changes further eroded support			0
' @entity4 is abusing people , ' said @entity206 of @entity89 , who opposed the new version approved monday			2
' @entity4 will be empowered to keep doing what they are doing			2

@entity211 bans intentional inappropriate touching
@entity4 will be let off if they have ' reasonable suspicion '
