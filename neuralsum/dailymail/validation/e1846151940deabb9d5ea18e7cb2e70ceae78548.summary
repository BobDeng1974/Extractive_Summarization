@entity0 has graced the grandest stages of them all			2
@entity4 and @entity5 triumphs sit proudly on a superb cv			0
his spell at @entity8 may not be on the same level , yet the unbridled joy displayed at creating history with the new @entity14 side ’s first ever goal on the hallowed turf of @entity16 was there for all to see			1
it was his presence which attracted a healthy and encouraging 43,507 here			0
and it was his typically busy display which ultimately was the difference			0
@entity0 fires past @entity21 to score the first goal for @entity8 at @entity16 the @entity23 finished off a neatly - worked move with @entity25 to put the hosts on the way to a well - deserved victory @entity16 played host to a whole new ball game as the @entity14 expansion franchise won its first game in the @entity33 a packed @entity16 watches as the two teams battle it out in the second game of the @entity14 season @entity37 : @entity38 ; @entity39 ( @entity40 79 ) , @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 ; @entity44 ( @entity45 66 ) , @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity25 ; @entity0 , @entity48 ( @entity49 84 )			1
booked : @entity42 , @entity39 goals : @entity51 19 , @entity49 84 @entity52 : @entity53 ; @entity54 ( @entity55 59 ) , @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 ; @entity59 , @entity60 ; @entity61 , @entity62 ( @entity63 71 ) , @entity64 ; @entity65 ( @entity66 65 )			1
booked : @entity65 , @entity60 sent off : @entity67 attendance : 43,507 his first goal since moving to the @entity71 this summer was a clinically taken strike on 20 minutes and , on another day and without the seemingly impenetrable @entity21 standing in his way , the 33 year - old would have bagged a hatful			1
yet he still managed to retain his composure and cross for @entity49 on 84 minutes to nab the killer second and prove the former @entity78 and @entity79 striker brings much more to the table than just lightning quick reactions in front of goal			1
of course , it 's not all about one man and , in truth , @entity87 ’s newest fledgling entity were decent value after securing their first win against a @entity52 side who were harshly forced to play with 10 for the last 23 minutes following @entity57 ’ straight red card			1
@entity87 have aggressively marketed their brand new adventure in @entity95 , hammering home the fact that they – and not the @entity99 based @entity98 – are the true team of @entity37			0
the numbers swilling around outside before kick - off suggested it had done the trick			2
yankee stadium , no matter how resplendent an arena it is , will never be a perfect fit for the beautiful game			0
yet @entity8 and their freshly conceived , enthusiastic fanbase did their best to make it feel like home			0
the makeshift pitch which has already got the baseball players fretting ahead of their season opener in three weeks time , was certainly passable			0
there was a decent atmosphere though here in the @entity118			0
the rarest of sightings in this vast country - away fans - played their part too			1
it was hard to gauge exactly at what stage @entity126 ’ side were at in the opening day draw with fellow newcomers @entity129			0
they are still in an embryonic stage after just a handful of games together			0
@entity8 celebrate after @entity49 wrapped up the first victory of the @entity14 season for the team @entity51 leaps into the air after scoring the first goal of his @entity14 career in front of an adoring crowd @entity0 shakes hands with @entity37 mayor @entity145 as @entity42 looks on before the victory at @entity16 @entity8 fans wait for the start of the game during the inaugural game of the @entity14 franchise @entity52 , who were denied the title last season by @entity156 ’s @entity155 , would certainly provide a much clearer yardstick			1
@entity51 buzzed around early on , teeing up frontman @entity159 who shot straight at revolution keeper @entity21 before the @entity160 was ace was denied on 15 minutes following a typical jinking run into the box			1
the former @entity78 man was , by far and away , the most potent player on the pitch			2
and on 19 minutes came his first @entity14 strike			0
it was a classic @entity51 moment			2
a sweet exchange with @entity25 opened up the visitor ’s backline and as @entity51 bore down on goal , there was only going to be one outcome			1
his finish was assured , calm and clinical			0
when @entity176 arrives in the summer , the added quality will ensure @entity87 will be hugely competitive			0
yet in the land of single entity leagues and the desperation of ensuring level playing fields , weaknesses in other parts of the pitch are harder to plug			0
the home side ’s defence looked particularly creaky with @entity52 knocking on the door with increasing regularity following @entity51 ’s opener			1
the best chances fell to @entity191 , the first on 36 minutes when a weak flick dribbled the wrong side of the post before he somehow headed straight at @entity196 from four yards out			0
an @entity37 fan sports a @entity176 shirt ahead of the @entity200 's arrival in @entity37 at the end of the @entity203 season fans flock to the stadium in the @entity118 to watch @entity37 's latest sporting team compete against the @entity52 fans wait to enter @entity16 for the @entity14 match between the two teams in the first home game for @entity8 three minutes after the re-start , the game should have been dead and buried			1
@entity51 was set free , twice he failed to apply the finishing touch			2
it was fast becoming the @entity53 and @entity51 show - the @entity52 keeper brilliantly tipping over a fierce 12 yard volley from the @entity160 superstar			1
the visitors were soon reduced to ten men on 67 minutes after centre - half @entity57 was handed a straight red for hauling down substitute @entity45			1
yes , he was the last man			2
yet contact was minimal if that			0
it was left to that man @entity51 though to have the final say when he crossed for @entity49 to make it two			1
@entity51 has wasted no time in making an impact			2
he is already the big man in the @entity33 .			2

@entity51 finished a *lovely* move in the 19th minute , *slotting* past keeper @entity21
the @entity23 played a neat one - two with @entity25 to score the franchise 's first goal in @entity16
revolution *skipper* @entity57 was sent off *midway* through the second half
@entity51 turned creator in the 84th minute , crossing for former @entity52 man @entity49 to convert from close range
