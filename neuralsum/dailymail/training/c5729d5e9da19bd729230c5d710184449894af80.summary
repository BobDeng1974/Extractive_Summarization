by @entity0 published : 08:30 est , 19 june 2012 updated : 09:49 est , 19 june 2012 the number of @entity2 moving to the @entity3 has surpassed @entity4 for the first time ever , reflecting a slowdown in illegal immigration while employers increase their demand for highly - skilled workers			1
an expansive study by the @entity12 details what it describes as ' the rise of @entity15 , ' a highly diverse and fast - growing group making up nearly 6 per cent of the @entity3 population			2
mostly foreign - born and naturalized citizens , their numbers have been boosted by increases in visas granted to specialized workers and to wealthy investors as the @entity3 economy becomes driven less by manufacturing and more by technology			1
diversity : the number of @entity15 migrants entering the @entity3 has surpassed hispanics reflecting a slowdown in illegal immigration and more visas for highly skilled employees ' too often the policy debates on immigration fixates on just one part - illegal immigration , ' said @entity38 , a political science professor at the @entity39 and a fellow at the @entity41			1
' @entity3 immigration is more diverse and broader than that , with policy that needs to focus also on high - skilled workers			1
' he added : ' with net migration from @entity48 now at zero , the role of @entity15 has become more important			0
' around 430,000 @entity2 , or 36 per cent of all new immigrants , arrived in the @entity3 in 2010 , according to the latest census data			2
that 's compared to about 370,000 , or 31 per cent , who were @entity53			1
across the nation : regional dispersal of @entity15 , according to the latest census data the @entity12 analysis , released today , said the tipping point for @entity15 immigrants likely occurred during 2009 as illegal immigrants crossing the border from @entity48 sharply declined due to increased immigration enforcement and a dwindling supply of low - wage work in the weak @entity3 economy			1
many @entity48 already in the @entity3 have also been heading back to their country , putting recent net migration at a standstill			0
as recently as 2007 , about 390,000 of new immigrants to the @entity3 were @entity15 , compared to 540,000 who were @entity53			1
the shift to increased @entity15 immigration , particularly of people from @entity74 , @entity75 and @entity76 , coincides with changes in @entity3 immigration policy dating to the 1990s that began to favor wealthy and educated workers			1
the policy , still in place but subject to caps that have created waiting lists , fast - tracks visas for foreigners willing to invest at least half a million dollars in @entity3 businesses or for workers in high - tech and other specialized fields who have at least a bachelor 's degree			1
the study revealed variations among @entity15 subgroups which belied their typecast as a ' model minority ' poverty : as a whole , @entity15 had a poverty rate in 2010 of 11.9 per cent , lower than the 12.8 per cent for the general @entity3 population			0
by country of origin , however , @entity102 , @entity103 and @entity104 were more likely than the average @entity3 to live in poverty , at rates of 14 per cent or more			0
education : the share of @entity15 who hold at least a bachelor 's degree surpasses the national average , 49 per cent to 28 per cent			0
@entity103 , however , fell below the national average at 26 per cent			0
people from @entity74 were most likely to have a college degree , at 70 per cent			0
unemployment : @entity118 and older were somewhat less likely to be unemployed than the national average for the first quarter of 2012 - 6 per cent compared to 7.4 per cent for all @entity3 workers			1
but in terms of long - term unemployment , @entity15 fared much worse , with median duration of unemployment at 28 weeks , second only to african - americans ( 31 weeks )			2
the national average was 22 weeks			0
illegal immigration : while immigrants from @entity131 often obtain visas and arrive legally , many also sneak across the @entity3 border or become undocumented residents after overstaying their visas			1
up to 15 per cent of @entity15 immigrants in the @entity3 are here illegally , compared to 45 per cent of @entity53 immigrants			1
international students studying at @entity3 colleges and universities are now most likely to come from @entity15 countries - around six in ten - and some of them are able to live and work in the @entity3 after graduation			2
@entity15 students , both foreign born and @entity3 born , earned 45 per cent of all @entity145 in 2010 , as well as 38 per cent of doctorates in math and computer sciences and 33 per cent of doctorates in the physical sciences			0
several bills pending in @entity152 that are backed by @entity3 businesses seek to address some of the visa backlogs , through measures such as eliminating per - country limits on employment - based visas or encouraging investment in the sluggish @entity3 real estate market			1
they have stalled amid broader public debate over immigration reform that has focused largely on lower - skilled , undocumented workers			1
in recent years , more than 60 per cent of @entity15 immigrants , aged 25 to 64 , have graduated from college , double the share for new arrivals from other continents			2
as a whole , the share of higher - skilled immigrants in the @entity3 holding at least a bachelor 's degree now outpaces those lacking a high - school diploma , 30 per cent to 28 per cent			2
' like immigrants throughout @entity3 history , the new arrivals from @entity131 are strivers , ' said @entity180 , executive vice president of the @entity12 and co-author of the report			1
' what 's distinctive about them is their educational credentials			0
these are n't the tired , poor , huddled masses of @entity190 's famous inscription on the @entity191			0
they are the highly skilled workforce of the 21st century			0
' the findings are part of @entity12 's broad portrait of @entity15 , immigrants or @entity3 - born children of immigrants who come mostly from @entity75 , the @entity200 , @entity74 , @entity201 , @entity76 and @entity202			2
now tied with hispanics as the fastest - growing @entity3 group , the nation 's 14.5 million asian - americans are slowly becoming visible as founders of startups in @entity209 , owners of ethnic eateries , grocery stores and other small businesses in cities across the @entity3 , as well as candidates for political office and a key bloc of voters in states such as @entity219 , @entity220 and @entity221 , according to experts			2
deterrent : illegal immigration to the @entity3 from @entity48 has dropped following moves like the fences along with @entity228 - @entity48 border projected to make up one in ten residents by mid-century , @entity15 as a whole tend to be more satisfied than the general public with their lives and the direction of the country			0
they lean @entity237 , prefer a big government that provides more services , and place more value on marriage , parenthood , hard work and career success			0
the @entity12 survey is based on an analysis of census data as well as interviews with 3,511 @entity15 adults living in the @entity3 , conducted by phone from january 3 to march 27			0
the poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 2.4 percentage points for all respondents , higher for subgroups .			0
