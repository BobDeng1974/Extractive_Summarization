by @entity0 , political correspondent young people are failing to find work because they lack ‘ grit ’ , a minister has warned			2
@entity5 insisted that ‘ social skills and discipline ’ are every bit as essential for success as qualifications – yet they are not being taught in schools			1
the minister for civil society also said he was struck by the ‘ crushingly low ’ self - confidence of many youngsters and the effect this has on their employment prospects			1
minister for civil society @entity5 said ' social skills and discipline ' are as important as qualifications for success but they are not being taught in schools his provocative comments came in response to the revelation that the number of 16 - to 24 - year - olds classed as ‘ @entity28 ’ – or ‘ not in education , employment or training ’ – has risen to an estimated 1.09million			1
of these , 47 per cent are not looking for work and are classed as economically inactive			1
and at a time when there are 529,000 job vacancies – up 56,000 in a year – it is estimated that some 640,000 @entity37 have never worked at all			1
mr @entity5 , son of former foreign secretary @entity38 , said : ‘ what we see in survey after survey is employers saying qualifications are important , but that just as important to us are so - called soft skills , character skills , the ability to get on with different people , to articulate yourself clearly , confidence , grit , self - control , these kind of qualities , and they are saying we are not seeing enough of this in kids coming out of school			1
@entity5 said youngsters lack ' grit ' and many have ' crushingly low ' self - confidence ‘ something ’s going wrong , this is a critical time in their lives to be stretching and challenging them and make them feel engaged			1
’ he added that the current estimate of 1.09million @entity28 was a ‘ horrible number and it ’s been high for too long ’			1
he said : ‘ the longer they stay out of work , the bigger the problem that becomes			2
’ a report from the @entity76 last week estimated that some 640,000 @entity28 had never even had a job			0
@entity78 , an economic analyst at the left - wing think - tank , said : ‘ we know from countless surveys of employers that they value employability and that those skills are lacking among young people			1
‘ they need people who turn up on time , look presentable and know how to present themselves in an interview			0
’ a separate report from the @entity91 also revealed how many bosses are ‘ disheartened , if not downright frustrated ’ by school leavers			2
mr @entity5 last week visited the @entity94 , a volunteering programme for thousands of 16 - and 17 - year - olds which the government hopes will help them develop the skills needed for the workplace			1
the scheme involves two weeks of team - building skills while living away from home , then the youngsters return to run a charity venture of their choice in their local area			1
it will be carried out by 34,000 young people this year , and following a funding boost from the government ministers hope that 150,000 youngsters will have completed it by 2015			2
charities and mps have questioned whether the money spent on running the scheme – £ 62million in the 2012 - 13 financial year – could be better invested in services to help disadvantaged youngsters			1
but as no participant pays more than £ 50 , @entity121 mr @entity5 said those of all backgrounds could benefit from it			2
he added : ‘ this is not for disadvantaged young people , it ’s for kids from both ends of the spectrum , which is very powerful in breaking down misconceptions and building confidence			2
the number of 16 to 24 - year - olds not in employment , education or training has risen to 1.09million ‘ the workplace has changed and most of the jobs i know require dealing with different types of people , communication skills			1
we need to raise our level of aspiration , show young people what they can do			0
’ mr @entity5 said 95 per cent of recruits told him they would otherwise be ‘ on the sofa ’ and the programme had ‘ changed their lives ’			1
he added : ‘ i ’ve been so struck over the years by how crushingly low sometimes confidence and self - esteem are among young people and it ’s amazing what impact you can have in just three weeks			1
’ describing a group who completed the programme last year , he said : ‘ there ’s a definite before and after effect in terms of their ability to articulate and present themselves			2
' the skills employers tend to talk about are social agility , the ability to get on with different types of people , and resilience , the ability to stick with things			2
‘ @entity94 is not a silver bullet , we need to create more jobs , but it plays a part alongside apprenticeships and traineeships and what we ’re doing to improve our schools			0
’ the @entity188 estimates extending @entity94 to half of 16 - year - olds would cost £ 350million a year – more than all youth services provided by local authorities			1
sir @entity192 , @entity193 chief executive , said employers were being left to ' pick up the pieces ' bosses have frequently claimed that young people are unable to find work because they are not taught the right skills at school			2
sir @entity192 , who at the time was boss of @entity193 , delivered a stinging attack on the education system in 2009			0
he called it ‘ woeful ’ and said employers were too often ‘ left to pick up the pieces ’			0
sir @entity192 told an industry conference in @entity209 : ‘ one area that @entity193 is particularly concerned about is education			0
‘ as the largest private employer in the country , we depend on high standards in our schools			0
sadly , despite all the money that has been spent , standards are still woefully low in too many schools			0
employers like us are often left to pick up the pieces			0
’ he added : ‘ from my perspective there are too many agencies and bodies , often issuing reams of instructions to teachers , who then get distracted from the task at hand : teaching children			0
’ sir @entity233 , at the time the @entity232 chairman , made similar comments only a week later , claiming school leavers were ‘ not fit for work ’			0
he said too many young people were leaving school without a basic grasp of the three rs.in an outspoken attack , the retailing boss said : ‘ they can not do reading			0
they can not do arithmetic			0
they can not do writing			0
’ sir @entity192 , who was brought up on a @entity248 council estate and educated at a grammar school , was the only one of four brothers not to leave school at 16			0
