before the veto , @entity2 officials said the bill would put their decision to play in the state into question the host committee has joined other high - profile companies such as @entity71 and @entity72 which have hit out at the bill			2
opponents claim it has the potential to allow @entity20 businesses to refuse service to homosexual customers			2
