lord @entity0 said too many babies are born to immigrant mothers in the @entity3 too many babies are being born to immigrant mothers in the @entity3 , a government minister said last night			1
in controversial remarks , lord @entity0 said that a quarter of children born in the @entity3 each year now had a mother who was herself from overseas			1
he added : ' that is why we need to reduce immigration '			2
in 2001 , prior to @entity15 presiding over a decade of wide - scale immigration , only 16 per cent of @entity3 births were to foreign mothers			1
home office minister lord @entity0 reeled off a series of statistics to demonstrate the significant impact mass immigration is having			1
they included the fact that , at the end of december 2013 , there were an estimated 7.8million people born overseas living in the @entity3			2
it is understood to be the first time a government minister has directly suggested a need to reduce the number of babies being born to immigrants			2
however , ministers and campaign groups have in the past stressed the pressure which is being put on maternity services and schools			0
lord @entity0 , who was previously mp for @entity40 in the north east , was responding to a @entity43 question from @entity45 chairman @entity44 of @entity46			1
in lively exchanges , lord @entity44 said that – based on current levels of net migration – @entity3 would have to build a new city the size of @entity52 every two years to cope			0
currently , there are 300,000 more people arriving in the @entity3 every year than leaving – demolishing @entity56 's pledge to cut the figure to the ' tens of thousands '			0
lord @entity0 said : ' we are absolutely at one on needing a firm but fair immigration policy to protect the public services of this country and provide opportunities for those who want to come here to work			1
' however , he was criticised by members of the @entity15 and @entity67 benches for his comments			1
@entity15 's @entity69 said the children of migrants ' have made an immensely valuable contribution to the @entity3 '			1
he added : ' we ought to be proud of that and say so			0
a quarter of children born in the @entity3 each year now had a mother who was herself from overseas @entity78 , a @entity67 , said political leaders ' need to make a case for the positive impact that immigration has had on this country '			1
she added : ' the care system would collapse without immigrant labour			0
does the minister think that the constant negative narrative of immigration , without the positive , is detrimental to @entity3 society — a society that has always been one of tolerance which values and upholds democracy in building better institutions ? do the @entity95 not really need to take the lead on this ? ' there has been controversy over the most accurate way of measuring the impact immigration is having on the size of the @entity3 population			2
last year , a report by @entity45 said immigration could be responsible for as much as 84 per cent of the surge in @entity3 's population this century			2
the study claimed the true impact of immigration has been ' substantially understated ' because the @entity110 did not count 1.3million children born to foreign parents as part of the impact of immigration on population growth			1
it concluded that of the 4.6million population rise between 2001 and 2012 , 3.8million is due to the biggest wave of immigration the country has faced			0
not including children born in the @entity3 meant net migration was recorded at a much lower 2.5million			1
in separate exchanges with the @entity15 benches , lord @entity0 defended the prime minister 's failure to hit his ' tens of thousands ' target			1
he said : ' it could well be that when the prime minister was making those remarks we were in the depths of despair as a country in 2010			0
' since then we have had a jobs miracle			0
we have created more jobs than the rest of @entity139 put together			0
' as a result of that , not surprisingly , people want to come and find work			0
' lord @entity0 , an @entity144 graduate , was made a deputy speaker of the @entity43 in 2013			2
he served as a government whip before being appointed to the @entity147 last year			0
he speaks for the government in the @entity149 on all matters dealt with by @entity152 's department .			0
