the son of an artist at the centre of a row over a school mural featuring a golliwog last night insisted his father was ‘ no racist			1
’ but @entity8 said he could understand why the image , which sparked an on - going police investigation , was controversial – and would have no objection if it was replaced			1
it was reported yesterday that a complaint about the 1930s painting - by @entity15 - had been logged by @entity16 as a ‘ hate incident ’			1
the mural , which was painted in 1936 by @entity15 and features scenes from @entity20 across nine panels , features a golliwog visiting parent @entity23 , 43 , who is herself black , made an official complaint after touring @entity25 in north @entity26 with her son who was at that time a prospective pupil			1
the image is contained in a mural , based on @entity20 , which was lovingly restored two years ago and now takes pride of place in the school ’s assembly hall			1
last night @entity8 , 74 , of @entity35 , @entity36 , said golliwogs had once been common , though he could understand why the image had proved offensive			1
but he suggested treating the situation as a ‘ hate incident ’ may be a flawed approach and said that while he would not want part of the mural to be ‘ hacked out ’ , he could understand why some would want the golliwog image to be removed			1
mr @entity8 said : ‘ it was painted in 1936 , when people ’s perception of things was somewhat different			1
‘ i remember that i had a golliwog when i was a small boy ; many children did			0
they used to be popular			0
for this woman , her response to that image was obviously compelling and overwhelming			2
‘ i saw photographs of the mural when it was restored , and i dug out my copy of @entity20			1
‘ my neighbour , for some reason , had collected 12 copies of @entity20 in different editions , and of course there was no golliwog in any of them			1
council bosses have resisted pressure to remove or cover up the artwork at the school in the north of the city - but have introduced extra anti-racism lessons ‘ it may be he felt the fantasy element of the story gave him some licence to create a new character			2
‘ but my father did n’t have any views at all on other races , and he was certainly no racist			0
’ he added : ‘ i can see why it could be a bit offensive – i did n’t give our children or grandchildren golliwogs			0
‘ this woman has every right to complain			0
but this painting is from another time			2
‘ i would not wish to criticise the police , as i understand the legislation is framed in such a way that they are obliged to investigate complaints and i would n’t want to presume to lecture the council ’s education department			2
‘ but for a “ hate incident ” , there has to be a “ hater ” - and that seems to be something missing from this case - while the artist [ who died in 1962 ] is long - dead			0
’ @entity107 artist @entity106 , who painted a mural depicting @entity20 at @entity25 in @entity26 in the 1930s he added : ‘ i would n’t like the mural to have a bit of it hacked out , but if someone feels strongly enough that it should be painted out , and replaced with something else , that would be okay			1
’ @entity116 - born @entity106 , who was born in 1905 , was responsible for well - known portraits of poet @entity118 and sir @entity119 , who wrote the comic novel @entity120 , later turned into a hit @entity122 comedy movie			0
last night @entity16 said mrs @entity23 ’s complaint was still being considered			1
mrs @entity23 was astonished to find the mural , which features scenes from @entity20 across nine panels			1
it was restored in 2011 with a £ 17,600 grant from the @entity129 ( @entity129 )			2
mrs @entity23 , who said she would now find a different school for her son , said she found the image ‘ deeply offensive ’ and struggled to believe the recent restoration had been be allowed			1
she said : ‘ i raised it with the headteacher and she shrugged her shoulders and did n’t seem to think it was an issue			0
‘ it ’s an inappropriate image for a primary school hall			2
it ’s one thing if it was a museum piece or an exhibition , where you might explain what a swastika was or @entity145 outfit			0
‘ it goes back to the @entity146 - the blacked - up face			0
’ in the mural , the golliwog is sitting on an alcove ledge above the @entity152 figure in the mural ’s central panel			2
the mural and @entity158 school ’s distinctive architecture are well - known in academic circles			0
@entity160 , head of @entity161 , has contacted the school over the future of the artwork , with further discussions likely to take place later this week			0
last night the @entity167 reiterated its position – that it will not consider covering up the image			0
but officials have said they will now use additional teaching packs from @entity173 campaign at the school			0
a council spokesman insisted the council and school took diversity and anti-racism extremely seriously .			0
