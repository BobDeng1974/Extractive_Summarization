by @entity0 visitors to @entity2 can not fail to notice the capital ’s many layers of history from its rugged roman walls to elegant @entity8 townhouses			2
and now a group of historians has mapped the evolution of the capital from its roots as a @entity15 city in @entity16 to the modern metropolis we navigate today			1
the animation begins when @entity2 was focused in a square mile – which continued to as late as the 17th century - to the suburban sprawl of the 21st century , which magnified the size of the city to an area of 600 square miles ( 966km squared )			1
here , roman roads converge in the @entity32 the etymology of @entity2 is uncertain but it is thought that it is @entity15 in origin			1
the first recording of the name @entity38 dates from the second century			2
there was a theory that it originated from a ' @entity42 ' but this has been discarded			0
historians in the @entity45 maintained that the city 's name is @entity48 and means ' place belonging to a man called @entity51 , ' but again , this theory has been thrown out			0
in 1998 @entity53 suggested that @entity2 is pre-celtic for ( p ) lowonida - ' river too wide to ford ' - suggesting that it is named after the @entity58			2
it could have a @entity61 and @entity15 origin			0
until 1889 the name ' @entity2 ' only applied to the @entity32 , which was the @entity15 part of the city , but it now applies to the county and @entity2			1
it maps the evolution of @entity2 ’s bustling road network and menagerie of historical , listed buildings , including some of the capital ’s most iconic landmarks , such as the @entity73			1
@entity2 is made up of a mishmash of architectural styles , unlike cities such as @entity77 , and these are clearly divided into ancient and more recent eras			0
created by the @entity81 for @entity82 ( @entity83 ) , the animation shows @entity2 ’s industrialisation over 2,000 years			2
the map took nine months to make and is based on datasets from the @entity88 , @entity85 maps from the @entity89 and historical maps showing road layouts from the 18th century to present day			0
these were provided courtesy of the @entity94			0
while information about the city ’s 19,000 listed buildings came from @entity98 and the @entity99			2
this artist 's impression shows sections of the defensive wall during its construction in the second century ad.the wall - small sections of which are still standing today - stretched from the @entity58 forming a northern boundary to the town , and incorporated existing buildings including the fort ( left foreground ) while very little @entity15 architecture survives above ground , archaeological finds have been protected below the surface of the @entity116 , which are marked on this map in red the network of roads expaned slightly in the @entity121 and medieval period , although the population did not grow as rapidly as it was repeatedly hit with disease and famine the experts are currently working on a @entity128 version , which would allow people to step back in time without pounding the busy streets , according to the blog of @entity132 , who was involved in the project			1
in the video , the roads begin in @entity15 with arteries converging in @entity38 , especially the @entity32 , which is now filled with banks and skyscrapers			1
they slowly become more intricate , while buildings gradually creep outwards into the countryside			0
the roads are laid over a light modern map of @entity2 , while buildings of a certain period are marked by bright yellow dots			0
the city was largely abandoned in @entity148 by the @entity149 who preferred to build large farms , and these formed the basis for places like @entity154 and @entity155			0
but from the 9th century onwards @entity2 was back on its growth trajectory within the @entity15 walls , with @entity158 becoming the first established political centre			1
while the city started its life squashed into just one square mile , it is now a densely populated metropolis stretching from the @entity116 with its sky scrapers to leafier suburbs @entity2 saw a growth in population in the tudor period to almost 200,000 , having previously been ravaged by famine and plague			1
a lot of development occured during the reign of @entity175 who destroyed a lot of the capital 's religious sites			0
major roads and listed builds are marked on this map @entity2 is made up of a mishmash of architectural styles unlike cities such as @entity77 , which are clearly divided into ancient and more modern periods			2
most tudor buildings were based in the @entity32 , but @entity186 , in @entity2 was @entity175 's hunting lodge in the leafy suburbs between @entity15 and the 17th century , buildings rotted away , burnt down or were deliberately damaged and were rebuilt in the styles of the day			1
the @entity191 in 1666 was responsible for destroying four fifths of the city and so very few medieval buildings remain today			0
by 1840 , @entity2 was the most powerful city in the world with a population of 2 million and swathes of elegant @entity8 houses and streets were built			0
however , it was under the reign of @entity203 @entity202 that the city exploded with a population of 6.5 million prospering from the @entity206			0

here , listed @entity8 houses and landmarks are marked on the map by 1840 , @entity2 was the most powerful city in the world with a population of 2 million and swathes of elegant @entity8 houses and streets having been built , such as @entity218 pictured innovations such as steam trains and the @entity222 enabled areas of @entity2 to be developed for housing , and despite modern town planners between the 1940s and the 1970s demolishing some of the red brick properties , plenty of terraces remain in the suburbs			2
@entity230 decimated many buildings and the population but despite this , the 20th century saw the largest amount of growth in the country ’s history			0
only the very best examples of 20th century development are protected today			0
the @entity240 is @entity2 ’s most recently listed building able to be added to the list as it is now over 30 years old			1

@entity2 's intricate road network and areas of housing are pictured only the very best examples of 20th century development are protected today			1
the @entity240 ( pictured ) is @entity2 's most recently listed building able to be added to the list as it is now over 30 years old @entity2 has plenty of listed buildings from many different historical periods since its founding 2,000 years ago , but they make up a small percentage of the capital 's housing stock			1

@entity2 was largely focused in one square mile from @entity16 - when @entity38 was established by the @entity15 - until the 17th century
it now covers around 600 square miles ( 966 square km ) including the suburbs , which were largely established in @entity263 times
the animated video was created by a number of *academic* institutions over nine months and shows the growth of @entity2 's road network
listed buildings from different periods are also included , the most recent of which is the @entity240
