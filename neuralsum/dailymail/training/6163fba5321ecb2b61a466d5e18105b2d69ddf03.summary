i was lucky it was n’t my front windscreen			1
' there were cars travelling at 60 or 70 mph and it was a busy time of night , this could have easily caused a major accident			1
' mr @entity25 believes the culprits may have been hiding in the trees by the side of the road on wednesday when the incident took place			1
he added : ' it was lucky i was in the car on my own , if someone had been in the passenger seat i dread to think what would have happened			1
' the window imploded all the way over to my side of the car			1
whatever hit it must have been quite large			1
' in fact the impact was so that it also dented a rear door of his car			2
