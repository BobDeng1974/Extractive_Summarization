his role will be to conduct a thorough investigation into the situation and work with @entity26 to ' analyse evidence of extremist infiltration in both academies and council - run schools ' , the @entity16 said			1
the @entity16 said that mr @entity1 has substantial experience in leading high - level investigations , and his appointment means that the allegations can be examined in a ' professional and dispassionate manner '			1
the move comes the day after it was disclosed that 25 schools are now under investigation over the alleged hardline @entity6 plot to force out governors and headteachers			1
@entity26 has already announced the appointment of @entity43 as chief adviser to directly handle at least 200 complaints received in relation to the @entity48 allegations focusing on schools in the city			1
the council 's investigation , running next to the @entity16 's separate inquiry , is due to initially report back in may			2
mr @entity54 said : ' i am extremely concerned by the allegations made in connection to a number of schools in @entity8			2
' i have already asked @entity60 to inspect a number of schools of concern and these investigations are ongoing			0
but wider , more comprehensive action is needed			0
' these allegations need either to be substantiated and firm action taken , or to be shown to be baseless			0
we can not allow uncertainty for parents or pupils to persist			0
' that is why i am appointing a commissioner to oversee this work			0
@entity1 brings a wealth of relevant skills and experience , and is very well placed to lead a fair and thorough assessment of the evidence , and report back to me			2
we expect he will work closely with @entity26			2

the unsigned and undated ' @entity145 ' document also claimed to have caused ' a great amount of organised disruption ' in the city , crediting the plan with forcing a change of leadership at four schools			2
@entity154 , the headteacher of @entity80 , said she would act against anyone plotting against the school since the letter came to light , anonymous whistle - blowers have claimed that boys and girls were segregated in classrooms and assemblies , sex education was banned , non-muslim staff bullied , and in one case it was alleged that the teachings of a firebrand @entity170 - linked @entity6 preacher praised to pupils			1
sir @entity121 said the council was ' in dialogue ' with the @entity16 , and confirmed none of the @entity60 inspection reports would be published by the education watchdog until after @entity178			0
@entity181 is also still looking into the authorship of the document , the council 's leader said			0
the allegations detailed in the @entity48 letter focus on the @entity186 , which runs three schools in the city - all of which have been subjected to snap @entity60 inspections in recent weeks			0
among further claims which have since come to light , one former anonymous staff member at @entity194 in @entity195 alleged a colleague had in an assembly praised the firebrand @entity170 - linked @entity6 cleric @entity198 - he was killed by a @entity200 drone strike in @entity201 in 2011			2

he spent three more years as head of the @entity221 from 1997 - 2000 , which meant he was in charge of royal protection when @entity225 , @entity225 died in @entity226 in 1997			0
