@entity1 art collector @entity0 , who owned more than a thousand pieces of valuable art a landscape by @entity5 has been found in a suitcase the late @entity1 collector @entity0 had with him during a hospital stay , becoming the latest piece to emerge from his long - hidden art trove			1
the suitcase was left at the hospital for unknown reasons , and was handed over earlier this week to the court - appointed administrator of @entity0 's estate , the task force investigating the piece 's origin said today			2
the find comes after officials reported finding a few more works at @entity0 's @entity24 apartment in july , including a sculpture apparently by @entity26			2
like the @entity5 , they were not among 1,280 pieces authorities seized from the apartment in 2012 while investigating a tax case , a collection that included works by @entity32 , @entity33 and @entity34			1
it was not immediately clear where the @entity5 was kept and why it was not seized			0
the task force said it will check whether the @entity5 was stolen by the @entity39 , as it is doing with many other works in @entity0 's collection			1
it said it appears after initial examination that the light - blue landscape , painted on paper , may have been produced around 1864			0
the subject appears very similar to the @entity48 artist 's ' garden of @entity49 '			2
@entity0 died at home in may after spending weeks in a hospital following heart surgery			1
news of the art trove 's seizure emerged only in november			0
authorities had discovered the works while investigating @entity0 for suspected import tax evasion			0
@entity5 's ' @entity59 ' - to which the discovered painting is said to be similar paintings by @entity33 ( left ) and @entity34 ( right ) which were discovered at @entity0 's apartment he inherited the collection from his father @entity64 , an art dealer who traded in works confiscated by the @entity39			1
@entity0 designated @entity67 's @entity66 as sole heir to his collection			0
the museum is considering whether to accept the bequest			0
shortly before he died , @entity0 reached a deal with the @entity1 government to check whether hundreds of the works had been looted from @entity76 owners by the @entity39			2
@entity0 was a notorious @entity1 art hoarder who died in may aged 81			1
his father , @entity64 , was @entity80 's art dealer , and dealt in works confiscated by the @entity39 from @entity76 or museums			1

@entity0 was investigated for tax reasons when he was found carrying huge wads of cash while on a train from @entity67			0
the incredible array of art was estimated to be worth around Â£ 850million			0
depite the value of his assets , @entity0 did not have an extravagant lifestyle , only selling a painting when he needed money .			0
