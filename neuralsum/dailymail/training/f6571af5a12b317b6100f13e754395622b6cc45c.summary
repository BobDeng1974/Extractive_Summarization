by @entity0 published : 06:39 est , 30 april 2012 updated : 18:56 est , 30 april 2012 fragments of @entity2 from two unidentified people were found on the bag holding the body of @entity7 spy @entity6			1
the traces were discovered during a search in which ‘ almost everything conceivable ’ was done to find out if anyone else had been in the flat where his body was found			1
but a forensic expert admitted neither is likely to lead to a suspect because they contain partial and common fragments of @entity2			1
mystery : the body of spy @entity6 was found in a bag in his bathroom in @entity21 in august 2010 @entity23 detectives are now pinning their hopes on tests on a green hand towel recovered from the secret agent ’s kitchen			1
@entity29 , of @entity30 , said : ‘ there is hope			0
@entity33 are still in progress and there may be some promising results			0
within a matter of weeks			0
’ her findings will be seized upon by detectives desperate to identify a third party who they believe padlocked mr @entity6 , 31 , in the holdall			0
the naked and decomposing body of the code - breaker was found a week later in the bath of his flat in @entity21 , @entity48 , on august 23 , 2010			1
the latest evidence came as the inquest into his mysterious death entered its final stages at @entity54			2
experts said that despite being young and fit , mr @entity6 would have succumbed to the ‘ soporific ’ effect of carbon dioxide poisoning ‘ within two to three minutes ’ of being zipped inside the @entity59 holdall			1
three pathologists agreed he either suffocated or was killed by a mystery poison that can not be detected because it disappeared during decomposition			0
summing up the forensic evidence found in mr @entity6 ’s home , mrs @entity29 said the first trace of unidentified dna , from the handle of the bag , may belong to a police forensic scientist who also left a trace on the dead man ’s hand			1
the second , recovered from the padlock , is likely to be old and contained a fragment of @entity2 found in half the @entity75 population			2
mrs @entity29 said there was no evidence that @entity2 had been cleaned from the flat , but admitted a third party could have avoided leaving traces by wearing protective clothing and gloves			2
mystery : mr @entity6 was found dead locked inside a holdall in the bath of his flat @entity87 dr @entity86 said mr @entity6 probably died from @entity88 , a fatal accumulation of carbon dioxide in the blood			1
he said the spy may have had no time to realise he was in danger before being overwhelmed by the gas as it built up in the bag with every breath			1
another pathologist , dr @entity97 , said the spy must have got into the bag himself as it would be ‘ extremely difficult ’ to place a ‘ floppy ’ dead body in such a neat position			1
he said there was no evidence mr @entity6 was manhandled but conceded he could have been sedated or forced inside at gunpoint			0
the second week of the inquest into mr @entity6 ’ baffling death heard evidence from three pathologists who examined his body in minute detail			1
the hearing was also told that @entity2 was ' at least ' two other people was found in the flat where the @entity7 officer was found dead			1
at home : the lounge of mr @entity6 ' flat in @entity21 , @entity48 they found few clues as to what happened in the final moments of his life which led to his body being found in a padlocked @entity59 holdall in his bath			1
but they agreed that the high - flying code - breaker either died from some form of suffocation or was killed with an undetected poison			0
coroner dr @entity132 was told that decomposition , accelerated by his position in the bag during a hot summer month in his heated flat , hindered their investigations			1
the dead man ’s @entity7 boss has been criticised for failing to act decisively until seven days after he failed to turn up for work			0
dr @entity86 said carbon dioxide can cause ‘ havoc with the chemistry of the body ’ as it leaves the victim confused and unable to act			2
the results , known as hypocapnia , would include headaches , then confusion and eventually unconsciousness and cardiac arrest , the inquest heard			0
dr @entity97 said the spy got into the bag himself as it would be ‘ extremely difficult ’ to place a ‘ floppy ’ dead body in such a neat position			1
he said there is no evidence mr @entity6 was manhandled but conceded he could have been sedated or forced inside at gunpoint			0
he said : ‘ i think it would have been a very difficult process to achieve , getting a body so neatly into a bag			2
were he to be alive and struggling i would anticipate there to have been injuries			2
’ speaking about carbon dioxide poisoning , he added : ‘ there may have been a period of awareness but it may have been short and rapidly contradicted by his decreasing ability to escape			2
’ asked about how he may have died in the bag , dr @entity97 said a struggle for fresh air would have been a ‘ strong driver ’ for an attempt to escape			0
but he added : ‘ there would have been a time when he was aware , it is possible			0
but carbon dioxide poisoning can cause confusion very quickly			0
’ suspicions : mr @entity6 ' body is taken out of his flat			2
relatives believe a third party was either present when @entity6 died or broke into his home afterwards to destroy evidence forensic scientist @entity29 said there was dna detected on the bag and handles which did not come from mr @entity6 but there was ' no complete indication from one individual			1
' she said it involved ' complex mixtures ' and that it was ' not always possible to unravel the mixture and identify the individual ' , meaning they are ' unconfirmed components			0
' she also said dna found on the bag could have been deposited years ago and said there were no samples consistent with his work colleagues - samples were obtained from 15 anonymous colleagues - being in the flat			1
the inquest heard mr @entity211 had several small grazes on his arms which could be consistent with an attempt to open the bag , but not a panicked escape attempt			0
mystery : the spy 's body was found inside the bag , padlocked from the outside unsolved : the inquest has heard that whether mr @entity6 was alive inside the @entity59 bag like this one and locked it himself ' was at the very heart of this inquiry ' dr @entity227 said the cause of mr @entity6 ’ death was ‘ unascertained ’ but that poisoning or asphyxiation were ‘ probably rather than possibly ’ to blame			1
he said the badly - decomposed condition of the body indicated the spy probably died shortly after he was last seen alive on august 15			2
the inquest had heard how it would have been almost impossible for mr @entity6 to lock himself inside the bag with a small brass travel padlock			0
two experts tried more than 400 times to seal themselves inside an identical bag but were unable to do so , saying escapologist ‘ @entity242 would struggle ’			0
the detective responsible for the investigation has said she is convinced a third party must have been involved in his death or a cover up			0
fragments of unidentifiable dna were found on the zip but there are no other traces of anybody else in his flat			1
the inquest is expected to conclude tomorrow			0
video : as part of the inquest , experts have tested whether it is possible to get out of the holdall			0

dna from ' at least ' two others found in flat where spy 's body was discovered
forensic expert admits fragments are unlikely to lead to identification
asphyxiation or poisoning ' foremost *contenders* ' in causes of death
*athletic* spy probably unconscious within two minutes of being locked in
' no injuries to suggest spy had struggled to get out of bag '
@entity87 says ' *floppiness* ' of corpse would have *prevented* him being moved into bag
