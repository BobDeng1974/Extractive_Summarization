a dime - sized endangered spider found at a @entity2 construction site has wound up tripling the cost of a planned new highway and delaying the project for years			1
a @entity6 meshweaver spider , only the second ever recorded by man , was discovered in a cave that @entity12 crews unearthed while building a highway in 2012			1
years later , the project originally slated for completion in 2012 has yet to break ground and is projected to cost at least $ 45 million by the time it 's done			1
big headache : a @entity6 meshweaver spider , only the second ever recorded by man , was discovered in a cave that @entity12 crews unearthed while building a highway in 2012 stopped everything : the spider was only the second ever seen , but it had previously been placed on the endangered species list , so construction of the $ 15 million highway stopped abruptly the original budget was $ 15 million			1
and ground wo n't even be broken until 2015			2
an underpass originally planned is being replaced with an overpass to accommodate the spider , known by its @entity33 name @entity32			2
so what 's so special about this tiny , blind bug ? ' the thing that was unique about this spider is that it had been seen only once before in recorded history , ' @entity36 , a spokesman for the @entity37 , told the @entity41			0
the last time a person had seen the spider was in 1980 in northwestern @entity44			0
but that one time was enough to get the meshweaver placed on the federal endangered species list in 2000			2
which means big headaches for contractors , crews and some locals			0
' i think that kind of tripling of infrastructure cost is a complete budget buster			0
' @entity58 , executive director of the @entity59 , told @entity60			0
' when they 're told that there is a dime - sized spider , which nobody had ever heard of , and it 's going to maybe cost lives because of ambulances or you ca n't get to work , they do n't understand it			1
they do n't see its value and they 're shaking their heads , ' she said			0
costly : the project was slated to be finished in 2012 but now wo n't even break ground until 2015 , and at a cost of at least three times the original $ 15 million cost			1

a @entity6 meshweaver was found in a cave *uncovered* by construction in the *middle* of a @entity12 area highway in 2012
the dime - sized , *translucent* *arachnid* was only the second ever discovered
*biologists* ordered the cave *sealed* , work stopped and the construction contract was terminated
years and at least $ *30million* later , the project will finally break ground in 2015 , though it was originally slated for completion in 2012
