eleven leading figures from nine parties have written a joint letter questioning the @entity4 's decision not to prosecute @entity5 for child abuse leading politicians from seven parties have come together to attack the decision not to prosecute @entity5 over child abuse and accused the @entity4 of orchestrating a ' whitewash '			1
putting the election aside , 11 leading figures said that director of public prosecutions @entity13 was ‘ damaging public confidence ’ in the justice system with her ruling			1
the @entity4 has been accused of double standards for not prosecuting @entity5 after it emerged at least 19 men with dementia have been convicted of child sex offences since 2010 , including ten in the past year			1
@entity21 has revealed that some paedophiles , including several too ill to enter a plea , have still been prosecuted and in some cases jailed for the rest of their lives because of historic sex attacks			2
but @entity13 and the @entity4 insist @entity5 can not face prosecution			1
politicians have written to a national newspaper to demand the decision be reversed amid public concerns			1
the cross-party group , led by @entity39 ’s @entity38 , asked in their letter to @entity41 : ‘ have we learnt anything from the mistakes of the past ? ‘ as long as justice is not seen to be done and the greater public interest is not served , the public will see attempts to investigate establishment figures involved in historic child abuse as a whitewash			1
’ mrs @entity13 announced last week that 86 - year - old @entity39 peer @entity5 , who has dementia , would not face trial over 22 serious offences against nine alleged victims in @entity54 , from the 1960s to the 1980s			1
the intervention was co-ordinated by mr @entity38 , who investigated the @entity57 abuse scandal in @entity58 and the subsequent cover - up			2
mrs @entity13 ’ decision has already drawn criticism from home secretary @entity62			1
police are considering a legal challenge , and @entity65 of @entity66 , a former director of public prosecutions , has also questioned the decision			2
last night a former president of the @entity70 said the @entity4 had failed in its duty to put suspected wrongdoers before the courts			1
@entity38 ( left ) lead the intervention , that was also backed by the likes of @entity78 @entity77 ( right ) , @entity80 mp @entity79 , @entity82 's @entity81 and @entity83 from the @entity84 @entity85 , who now represents victims and witnesses , said : ‘ @entity13 may well be right that @entity5 is not fit to stand trial but it should not be a matter for her to decide			1
' the matter should be brought before the courts so that the evidence may be tested in accordance with the law			0
‘ this case clearly demonstrates why victims of abuse feel let down by the system			2
’ @entity100 told @entity41 they were concerned about alleged improper attempts by a member of the bar to influence key legal decisions in their investigation into @entity5 and other suspects			1
a spokesman said : ‘ we are aware of this barrister and had concerns but were assured the @entity4 were dealing with this matter			1
’ the @entity4 said no improper attempts had been made to influence mrs @entity13			1
a spokesman said : ‘ the dpp was not unduly influenced by anyone when making this decision			2
as head of the @entity4 — an independent prosecuting authority — the @entity114 is used to making difficult decisions and will continue to do so independently			1
’ the letter accuses director of public prosecutions @entity13 ( pictured ) of ' damaging public confidence ' with her ruling that @entity5 is unfit to be prosecuted due to his @entity124 's a procedure exists to deal with criminal suspects thought to have mental illness			1
in serious cases where a judge rules a suspect is not fit to stand trial a jury can hear the evidence in the suspect ’s absence and decide if the individual committed the crimes			1
a suspect is not found to be guilty , or not guilty , but a jury do rule on if they have committed the crimes			0
often the judge will order them be detained in hospital , often indefinitely			0
the patient 's discharge , transfer or leave of absence from hospital can not be without the consent of the secretary of state			0
lord @entity5 ’s family has said that the former @entity152 mp is a man of the ‘ highest integrity ’ who is ‘ totally innocent of any wrongdoing ’			2
the peer was found to have alzheimer ’s disease in 2009 but continued to speak in the @entity158 until december 2013			0
he stopped attending in the week police searched his home in @entity161 , north @entity162 , and later took formal leave of absence			0
that leave was renewed this month when @entity5 signed a letter to @entity158 clerks			1
the full list of signatories to the @entity41 letter is : mr @entity38 ( @entity39 ) ; @entity170 ( @entity39 ) ; @entity83 ( @entity84 ) ; @entity77 ( @entity171 ) ; @entity172 ( @entity171 ) ; @entity81 ( @entity82 ) ; @entity79 ( @entity80 ) ; @entity173 ( @entity174 ) ; @entity175 ( @entity176 ) ; @entity177 ( @entity171 ) ; @entity178 ( @entity84 )			2
case : the @entity4 has decided not to prosecute @entity5 over alleged child sex offences but 19 others with dementia have been pursued in recent years the @entity4 has been accused of double standards for not prosecuting @entity5 after it emerged at least 19 men with dementia have been convicted of child sex offences since 2010 , including ten in the past year			1
@entity21 can reveal that some paedophiles , including several too ill to enter a plea , have still been prosecuted and in some cases jailed for the rest of their lives because of historic sex attacks			2
on friday @entity13 , director of public prosecutions , concluded that former @entity39 mp @entity5 's dementia made him unfit to plead on 22 historic child sex offences between 1969 and 1988			1
she decided there was no public interest in prosecuting @entity5 because of his illness , yet the @entity4 ' latest prosecution of a dementia sufferer on sex charges came in february			1
two months ago @entity202 , 68 , was considered unfit to plead to child sex charges against him but was tried by a jury anyway for sex attacks dating back to 2013 , and detained in a hospital indefinitely under the mental health act			2
@entity208 , of the @entity209 in @entity210 said : ‘ this is certainly double standards by the @entity4			2
of course any right thinking person knows deep down there is a cover up here			0
‘ the cases @entity21 has uncovered prove that and i believe there are more			0
i believe he ’s being protected			0
‘ there is unease that someone as influential and high profile as @entity5 will not face trial when @entity225 has			1
it is very convenient that the @entity4 finally admits he should have been prosecuted just a the time when they say they ca n’t			2
‘ people are worried about the beans he might spill should he be brought to trial ’			2
