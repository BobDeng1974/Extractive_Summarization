@entity0 could be hit by a series of damaging solar flares after the largest sunspot to be seen on the star for 24 years aligns with our planet			1
the sunspot , previously known as @entity8 12192 , began facing @entity0 in october but did not produce any coronal mass ejection ( @entity10 )			1
cmes are the most energetic events in our solar system , involving huge bubbles of plasma and magnetic fields being spewed from the sun 's surface into space			1
after disappearing for two weeks , it is once again facing our planet the region , renamed @entity8 12192 , has now rotated around to face @entity0 again , and is likely to create @entity10 , @entity25 scientist @entity24 told @entity27 during a video interview			1
' this time around , it 's more likely to have some coronal mass ejections associated with it , even though the solar flares might be smaller , ' she said			1
' we have a good idea , based on the structure of that magnetic field and the sunspot , that it 's very possible that it will create some mid-level flares			2
' magnetic fields in sunspots can store vast amounts of energy , but looping magnetic field lines can get tangled up and snap , releasing their energy as explosions called flares			0
@entity0 could be about to be hit by a series of damaging solar flares as a huge sunspots aligns with the planet a view of the visible sun showing the largest sunspot of solar cycle 24 , @entity54 , as seen on october 22 according to dr @entity56 , the sunspot is still large enough for 10 @entity0 to fit inside it , and is believed to be the 33rd largest of 32,908 active regions recorded since 1874			1
the @entity59 - sized sunspot produced six eruptions in october and early november , before disappearing for two weeks			1
solar flares can damage satellites and have an enormous financial cost			0
astronauts are not in immediate danger because of the relatively low orbit of this manned mission			0
they do have to be concerned about cumulative exposure during space walks			0
the charged particles can also threaten airlines by disturbing the @entity0 â€™s magnetic field			2
very large flares can even create currents within electricity grids and knock out energy supplies			0
a positive aspect , from an aesthetic point of view , is that the auroras are enhanced			0
geomagnetic storms are more disruptive now than in the past because of our greater dependence on technical systems that can be affected by electric currents			0
earlier this year , @entity86 , who is a member of an international task force , dubbed @entity88 , warned that solar ' super-storms ' pose a ' catastrophic ' and ' long - lasting ' threat to life on @entity0			2
a solar superstorm occurs when a @entity10 of sufficient magnitude tears into the @entity0 's surrounding magnetic field and rips it apart			2
such an event could induce huge surges of electrical currents in the ground and in overhead transmission lines , causing widespread power outages and severely damaging critical electrical components			0
mr @entity86 , carrying out doctoral research in aerospace engineering at @entity104 , said it is only a ' matter of time ' before an exceptionally violent solar storm is propelled towards @entity0			2
he says such a storm would wreak havoc with communication systems and power supplies , crippling vital services such as transport , sanitation and medicine			0
without power , people would struggle to fuel their cars at petrol stations , get money from cash dispensers or pay online , ' he said			0
' @entity124 and sewage systems would be affected too , meaning that health epidemics in urbanised areas would quickly take a grip , with diseases we thought we had left behind centuries ago soon returning			0
' the huge sunspot produced six eruptions in october and early november , before disappearing for two weeks the largest ever solar super-storm on record occurred in 1859 and is known as the @entity136 , named after the @entity138 astronomer @entity137 who spotted the preceding solar flare			1
this massive @entity10 released about 1022 kj of energy - the equivalent to 10 billion @entity143 bombs exploding at the same time - and hurled around a trillion kilos of charged particles towards the @entity0 at speeds of up to 3000 km / s. however , its impact on the human population was relatively benign as our electronic infrastructure at the time amounted to no more than about 124,000 miles ( 200,000 km ) of telegraph lines			2
mr @entity86 says these types of events are not just a threat , but inevitable			0
@entity25 scientists have predicted that the @entity0 is in the path of a @entity137 - level event every 150 years on average			1
this means that we are currently five years overdue - and that the likelihood of one occurring in the next decade is as high as 12 per cent			0
@entity54 is 14 times larger than @entity0 and almost as big as @entity59			1
the @entity164 told @entity165 it might be the largest sunspot in 25 years			1
it is so big that it can be seen in images of the sun from @entity0 's surface ( shown in this image from pilot @entity173 )			1

@entity54 , known as @entity8 12192 , began facing @entity0 in october
it disappeared for two weeks but is now facing @entity0 again , claims @entity25
the region is the largest sunspot to be seen on the sun in 24 years
this time it 's more likely to produce a series of coronal mass ejections
these are created when bubbles of plasma spew out from sun 's surface
cmes are capable of knocking out power grids and disrupting satellites
