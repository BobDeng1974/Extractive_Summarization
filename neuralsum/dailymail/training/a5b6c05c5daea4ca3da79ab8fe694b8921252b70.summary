by @entity0 they are responsible for the formation of continents , and are still active - as earthquakes and volcanic eruptions show			0
however , researchers have never been able to work out why the @entity7 developed tectonic plates , but other planets did not			1
now they have solved the mystery - and say the key is tiny minerals within rocks			0
researchers say weak zones caused the @entity7 's mantle to crack , causing tectonic plates to form @entity7 has a unique network of shifting plates embedded in its cold and rocky outermost layer , the lithosphere			1
the motion of these plates drives many @entity7 processes , including earthquakes and volcanic eruptions , while also stabilizing the planet ’s climate and enabling life			2
the division of the @entity7 ’s surface into rigid plates , separated by linear zones of concentrated deformation , is a defining characteristic of our planet , and unique among known terrestrial bodies			1
new @entity40 - led research suggests how and when @entity7 came to develop one of its most distinct features — rigid tectonic plates — and why @entity44 , @entity7 ’s twin - like neighbor , never has			1
' we think it all comes down to the behavior of tiny grains of minerals within rocks , ' said @entity40 geophysicist @entity51 , lead author of research published online april 6 in the journal @entity53			0
@entity7 has a unique network of shifting plates embedded in its cold and rocky outermost layer , the lithosphere			0
the motion of these plates drives many @entity7 processes , including earthquakes and volcanic eruptions , while also stabilizing the planet ’s climate and enabling life			2
despite evidence that @entity7 ’s solid surface was already in motion more than 4 billion years ago , global plate tectonics — replete with rigid plates and a variety of plate boundary types — appears not to have developed for a billion years more			1
and it never has on @entity44 , although the planet is so similar to @entity7 in size , composition , and gravity that it ’s sometimes called ' @entity7 ’s twin sister			1
' @entity51 and co-author @entity77 of the @entity78 in @entity79 argue that in @entity7 ’s early days , mantle convection caused weak zones in the lithosphere			1
these zones persisted , developed into plate boundaries , and ultimately connected to form a global network of tectonic plates			2
the weak zones , they argue , resulted from the tendency of mineral grains in rocks to shrink as the rock deforms			2
the weak zones , they argue , resulted from the tendency of mineral grains in rocks to shrink as the rock deforms			2
' if the rock gets weaker where it deforms , then deformation focuses there , making the grains shrink faster , in turn making the rock weaker , ' @entity51 said			0
' the weak zone narrows and intensifies until you get a distinct boundary			0
these are the plate boundaries			0
' this process does not happen on @entity44 , which has no plate visage , because its extremely high surface temperatures cause the grains to grow and weak zones to heal , he said			1
to illustrate their hypothesis , the scientists developed a theoretical model that explains how rock grains control the strength and weakness in the lithosphere			0
' the model uses physics at the 1 - millimeter rock grain scale to explain how the whole planet behaves , and how plate tectonics emerged on @entity7 , but not on her twin , ' he said .			0

weak zones in the earth 's surface led to the *eventaul* *creation* of giant tectonic plates
@entity133 explains why @entity44 , @entity7 ’s twin - like neighbor , has no plates
