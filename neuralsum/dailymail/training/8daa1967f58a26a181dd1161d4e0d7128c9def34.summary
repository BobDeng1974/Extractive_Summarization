with his ribs clearly visible and without a spare ounce on his body , @entity0 has lost a startling amount of weight in just ten days in the jungle			1
but despite his gaunt appearance and complaints over the lack of food , the @entity8 veteran will not be the third contestant to quit i ’m a celebrity … @entity14 ! , according to his wife			1
however , @entity16 , admitted she is ‘ quite concerned ’ for her husband because of his plummeting weight and is ‘ horrified ’ by the small amount of food his is having to survive on in the camp			1
the 68 - year - old has complained to his campmates of feeling hungry viewers have also noticed his increasingly frail frame and have expressed their concern on @entity34 , one posted : ‘ i think there is a strong possibility @entity0 may actually completely disappear in # @entity37 he ’s that thin already			1
’ while another added : ‘ @entity0 is so thin it ’s slightly distressing			1
if he ’s there at the end i dread to think what he ’ll look like ’			2
the journalist himself has admitted he is struggling with his hunger , confessing to audiences he would , ‘ give my right arm , my left arm , maybe both legs [ for food ]			1
’ and speaking yesterday , mrs @entity16 said : ‘ i was quite concerned [ about his weight loss ]			2
he was quite slim when he arrived			1
i was trying to encourage him to build up before coming out here , which he did n’t do			2
' he ’s not got a lot of spare flesh on him , but he ’s in good shape			2
i think it ’s far , far healthier to be a little bit underweight that overweight			2
‘ i was quite horrified to realise that they only get 500 calories a day in the jungle			1
it ’s not that he dislikes rice and beans , but the rations are quite low			2
’ @entity16 , admitted she is ‘ quite concerned ’ for her husband because of his plummeting weight and is ‘ horrified ’ by the small amount of food his is having to survive on			1
however , she said that he would not quit she added this lack of food could explain his often glum expression , commenting : ‘ with only 500 calories a day , they have n’t got enough energy to smile as well			1
’ she thinks he will feel his thin frame even more keenly as he tries to find a comfy perch in the jungle			1
she said : ‘ he ’s got no flesh on his backside at all now			2
he always did have quite a neat little bum			2
now , he ’s starting to feel it ’			2
the contestants on i ’m a celebrity … subsist mainly on a diet of rice and beans , winning meals for the camp by completing @entity88 , often involving eating unappetising dishes such as cockroaches or kangaroo penis			0
@entity0 ’s tribulations have fuelled speculation he might follow in the footsteps of reality star @entity95 and actor @entity96 , who have already pull out of this series of the hit @entity99 show			1
however , he wife was keen to assure viewers this would not be the case			1
she said : ‘ @entity0 is n’t a quitter			1
i do n’t see him walking out			0
he ’s been in worse places			0
he ’s been shot at , he ’s been gassed , he ’s been blown up in an ammunition dump explosion , he ’s seen a sound guy die , he ’s seen a cameraman lose his arm			0
' he ’s been in real reality situations that have been very tough			0
i would be really , really surprised if he broke			0
’ despite describing her husband as ‘ my pin - up ’ , mrs @entity16 has been ‘ amused ’ by tweets from viewers telling him to ‘ get your top back on ’			1
she said this is different from when he was in his prime as a reporter and newsreader , when he earned a loyal and loving following			0
she said : ‘ when @entity0 was presenting the news , it was a big audience			1
' it ’s not like today when audiences are much more fragmented			0
when you ’re presenting the news like he did , you become very important to lonely people			0
' there ’s a reliable face coming into the living room every night			0
he ’s definitely had a few nice letters over the years			0
’ however , even given his three decade career at the @entity8 , where he became accustomed to reporting from the grim conditions of @entity139 and apartheid @entity140 , @entity0 will still find the rigours of the jungle a shock , according to his wife			1
@entity16 ( pictured ) is now supporting her husband from @entity146 having flown in earlier this week the journalist opened up this week about his regrets over never asking his mother about his bigamist father she said : ‘ i know he would say @entity139 is the toughest place he ’s ever been to			1
it was a very , very frightening place where you ’re not sure whether you ’re going to get killed any minute			0
paces where there are lots of guns and they ’ve got into the hands of drugged - up kids			2
' he ’s been to a lot of scary places			0
it ’s a different type of scary to the jungle			2
he ’s been very lucky that he has n’t had to do any of the eating trials yet			0
i do n’t know how he ’d get on with eating something wriggling , but i think he ’s certainly faced tougher situations ’			0
are you watching this year 's i 'm a celebrity ? are you watching this year 's i 'm a celebrity ? now share your opinion no matter how dire the situation , @entity0 – who opened up this week about his regrets over never asking his mother about his bigamist father – can always turn to his campmates for support and his bond with chart - topping rap star @entity175 , 28 , has been one of the surprising highlights of the series			1
talking previously about their relationship , @entity0 said : ‘ we get on well because we are complete opposites			1
' he is young and hip and edgy			0
he is a really interesting guy			0
i am at least two or maybe even three generations separated from him			0
i am stuffy , stuck up , middle class and middle aged			0
and white , of course			0
’ and commenting yesterday , he wife said : ‘ i think it ’s great , although he ’s practically old enough to be @entity175 ’s grandfather ! ' the show opened up with @entity0 on his own and then @entity175 was the next person to arrive			1
whether their bonding sprang from that original meeting , i do n’t know			0
’ the journalist was given a private rap lesson by @entity175 , whose verdict on @entity201 was , ‘ a cool dude , he ’s so uncool that he ’s cool			0

@entity0 looks visibly slimmer since he arrived in @entity146 jungle
