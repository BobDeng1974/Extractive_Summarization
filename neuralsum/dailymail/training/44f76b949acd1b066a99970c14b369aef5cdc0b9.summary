by @entity0 , @entity1 editor published : 01:44 est , 10 december 2013 updated : 04:02 est , 10 december 2013 a @entity3 price war has been triggered by @entity4 which is offering six foot trees for just £ 25 , which come with a £ 20 money - off voucher			1
the deal , which effectively brings the price down to £ 5 a tree , threatens to snatch a huge amount of trade from garden centres , which typically charge £ 40 to £ 50			0
it will also be a big blow to @entity16 growers , who yesterday delivered the traditional christmas tree to @entity18 for the festive season			1
tumbling price : @entity4 is offering @entity3 trees for just £ 25 together with a £ 20 money - off voucher blow : the imported @entity25 trees could cripple @entity16 growers , who provided @entity18 's tree yesterday @entity4 is offering thousands of the @entity28 trees from @entity29 , plus some from @entity30 , for the loss - leader promotion , which is designed to drum up trade both before @entity3 and in in its @entity34 sale			1
the deal is expected to generate long queues in the car parks at @entity4 stores , which are already difficult to get to and through at the best of times			1
the decision could also turn around a fall in demand for real trees in recent years , with people switching to increasingly lifelike artificial versions or arty options , such as the popular designer paper tree from @entity48			0
research for the @entity51 retailer suggests @entity16 families spend a staggering £ 150 million a year on real @entity3 trees			2
it found that the average price for a six foot tree with non-drop needles is £ 48			0
however , families in some parts of the country are paying as much as £ 79.99			0
decline : prices has risen as fewer buyers visit country estates and small - scale growers to pick up trees it said the city with the highest average price was @entity69 at £ 60 , ahead of @entity70 at £ 56 , @entity71 at £ 54 , and both @entity72 and @entity73 at £ 52			2
the cheapest average was @entity75 at £ 40 , ahead of @entity76 at £ 41 , @entity77 at £ 43 , @entity78 at £ 44 and @entity79 at £ 44			0
historically , @entity4 allowed outside companies to sell their own trees in the car parks of its stores			0
however , the chain first began offering its own cheap trees last year with the result it ended up with a glut and found it necessary to virtually give them away			2
in the final days before @entity3 it was selling £ 25 trees for £ 7.50 and offering customers a £ 20 voucher			1
if the customer used the voucher , they were effectively getting a free @entity4 tree and £ 12.50 to spend			2
@entity96 , the deputy country sales manager for @entity4 in the @entity16 and @entity97 , said : ‘ there ’s something really special about having a real tree in the home during the festive season , but over the years we ’ve seen prices rocket to a level that a lot of people just ca n’t afford			0
' the christmas tree offer is not valid at certain @entity4 stores in @entity110 , @entity111 , and @entity112 , while the £ 20 voucher has to be used between january 20 and feb 9 .			1

trees will cost £ 25 but come with a £ 20 voucher for another purchase
offer is similar to one last year and is expected to cause long queues
blow to @entity16 growers as @entity123 are imported from @entity29
