by @entity0 published : 19:52 est , 21 august 2012 updated : 01:58 est , 22 august 2012 a species of rat has been discovered that can not gnaw or chew and represents a new step in rodent evolution			1
the shrew - like animal , @entity6 , has fang - like upper incisors which are useless for gnawing and no back teeth			1
it lives exclusively on earthworms which it sucks out of the ground at the foot of the jungle with its long snout			0
a rat with no back teeth : its discovery represents a new step in rodent evolution @entity23 was found in a remote rainforest on the @entity26 island of @entity27			1
it shares some characteristic with insectivorous shrew rats from the @entity31 but has taken an evolutionary step further by completely dispensing with chewing molars			1
dr @entity34 , from @entity35 in @entity36 , a member of the discovery team , said : ' there are more than 2,200 rodent species in the world and until this discovery all had molars in the back of their mouth and incisors at the front			0
' this is an example of how species , when faced with a new ecological opportunity , in this case an abundance of earthworms , can evolve the loss of traits that were wildly successful in previous circumstances			2
' the rat is an example of how species can evolve in difference circumstances @entity61 is described today in the latest issue of the @entity64 journal @entity65			2
the creature has a rat - like tail but a long , thin nose similar to a shrew â€™s			2
its only teeth are its incisors , which in the upper jaw end in twin points			0
the @entity76 derived genus name @entity6 means ' few - toothed mouse ' and the species name vermidax means ' devourer of worms '			0
co-author @entity83 , from @entity84 in @entity26 , said : ' the specialised incisors of rodents give them the distinct ability to gnaw - a defining characteristic of rodents worldwide			1
a skull of the newly discovered rat @entity6 , showing fang - like upper incisors upon closer inspection : @entity96 - like upper incisors of the creature that lives off worms ' in having lost all teeth except a pair of unusually shaped incisors that are incapable of gnawing , this new rat is unique among rodents			1
' dr @entity34 said the find was a reminder that wild habitats can still harbour undiscovered species			0
he added : ' in the mountains of @entity27 , where we discovered @entity6 , healthy forests still nurture rare and remarkable species , however , they are isolated patches imperilled by expanding logging , mining , plantations and other human activities			0

shrew - like animal found on @entity26 island is ' unique ' among rodents
rat taken evolutionary step forward as it has no chewing molars
example of how species can evolve when faced with new *surroundings*
