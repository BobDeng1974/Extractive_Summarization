@entity0 has @entity1 doing something that none of the other top teams are - playing long balls			1
time and time again his central defenders will bypass the midfield and aim straight for the front and i applaud it			0
@entity10 is playing to his strengths			2
his best outfield players are @entity13 , @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17 and he needs to get them on the ball as much as possible			1
there is no real need to pass through the compartments , especially when @entity22 is the only conventional midfielder in his team			0
@entity16 ( right ) of @entity1 challenges @entity25 's @entity24 for the ball @entity0 ( left ) has his @entity1 side playing the ball long to get it to his strikers quickly @entity1 have played the second - highest number of long balls in the @entity32 this season being direct gets his danger men on the ball in danger areas			1
it happened time after time against @entity25 so it is no surprise that only @entity37 have played more long balls this season			1
what is interesting is that @entity1 are not even that worried about whether @entity40 or @entity15 win the initial header from the ball upfield - they just make sure that @entity14 or @entity17 are there to pick up the knockdown , ready to cause problems in the final third			1
they can suffocate you with so much quality			0
it suits @entity1 ’s defenders too			1
@entity51 , @entity52 and @entity53 are happier playing long balls as they are not confident enough to pick out more intricate passes			1
1 ) @entity37 ( 1,485 ) 2 ) @entity1 ( 1,437 ) 3 ) @entity56 ( 1,401 ) 4 ) @entity57 ( 1,349 ) 5 ) @entity58 ( 1,348 ) 1 ) @entity59 ( 2,395 ) 2 ) @entity60 ( 2,299 ) 3 ) @entity61 ( 2,239 ) 4 ) @entity62 ( 2,180 ) 10 ) @entity1 ( 2,077 ) @entity14 and @entity1 's other attacking players have benefitted from receiving the ball quickly @entity22 ( left ) is @entity1 's best technical midfielder but they sometimes bypass him there is a lot to be said for a more direct approach at times			1
people talk about long balls and short balls but football is about playing the right ball			1
too often the obsession with playing the ball through each compartment of the team again and again slows teams down			2
@entity60 and @entity61 are two of the most guilty			0
@entity79 is one of the best strikers in the @entity32 but he often leaves the pitch looking like he ’s in a strop			2
you ca n’t blame him because he ’s more or less ignored for 90 minutes as his team - mates fail to get the ball to him early			0
i ’ve lost count of the number of times @entity90 has a forward , diagonal pass available but turns round and plays it square because that is what he has been told to do			0
@entity97 is being similarly starved at @entity61 - he only had four touches in the opposition box at home to @entity101 last week			0
@entity1 's defenders such as @entity51 ( left ) are better suited to playing the ball forward quickly and long @entity60 's @entity90 ( right ) often chooses to pass short and sideways instead of long and forward @entity60 and @entity61 need to vary their approach like they did last season , when both sides were in the top three in terms of the most direct passes played			1
the aim of the game is to climb a ladder through the team - it does n’t matter how you get to the top of it as long as you do			0
and as a defender you are far happier when teams are passing the ball round and round in front of you as it is not testing you			0
look how @entity59 ’s direct approach with @entity123 caused @entity125 problems on sunday			0
@entity37 ’s attacking pair @entity127 and @entity128 are doing really well but that is because @entity37 get the ball forward to them a lot so they have opportunities to affect the match			1
@entity37 's @entity127 ( centre ) has benefited from his side getting the ball forward quickly @entity97 is struggling in an @entity61 side who are intent on passing the ball too short even under @entity142 i played the occasional long ball to mix things up , the most notable being the pass that set up @entity146 for the winning goal at @entity148 in 1998			1
if you build up too slowly , the opposition has time to get 11 men behind the ball			0
i watched the @entity154 youth team recently and they adopted a similar approach to @entity10			0
their centre halves played the ball up to the front men quickly and they were n’t obsessed with passing through the compartments for the sake of it			2
when you watch youth football in @entity166 , defenders seem to be programmed to play the same passes all the time , sideways or slightly forward in a horseshoe shape			1
it became the trend after all of @entity172 ’s success but we need to train the next generation to feel comfortable playing both ways			0
@entity146 scored at @entity148 for @entity176 in 1998 after a long through - ball from @entity178 it ’s the same with defending : we have a generation of centre backs who are only used to facing one striker			2
so when @entity1 or other teams use two up front , defenders look confused			2
@entity10 has clearly spotted this and it is reaping dividends - now it ’s time for others to follow suit .			0

@entity1 have played the second - highest number of long balls in the @entity32 so far this season behind @entity37
@entity0 has his players playing to their strengths this season
@entity1 play ball forward quickly in order for @entity13 , @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17 to have *possession*
their defenders are happier playing long balls than intricate passes
too many @entity32 sides play *meaningless* , sideways passes
