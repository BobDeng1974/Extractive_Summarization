this defeat , inflicted with a moment of @entity2 , hurts @entity3 considerably			1
on an unbeaten run of four matches and with a following wind in their fight against relegation , @entity5 ’s victory leaves their sails flapping with weaker gusto			1
with upcoming fixtures against @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity20 , and @entity21 , a home match to @entity5 would have been seen as a vital chance to clinch three points			1
but in a game of modest quality , @entity25 sprinkled some stardust with his winning goal in the 63rd minute			1
the pass from @entity31 was slightly behind him , but the boy from @entity33 showed skills honed at @entity35 to adjust his body , swivel quickly and direct a laser - sharp shot from 18 yards into the far corner			2
@entity25 ( right ) celebrates with team - mate @entity31 after scoring the winner for @entity5 at the @entity40 @entity25 battles for the ball with @entity3 's @entity42 during saturday 's game @entity3 ( 4 - 4 - 2 ) : @entity44 6.5 ; @entity45 6 , @entity46 5 , @entity47 6 , @entity48 6 ; @entity42 6 , @entity49 6 , @entity50 6 , @entity51 6.5 ( @entity52 ’ 5 ) ; @entity53 6 ( @entity54 65 ’ 5 ) , @entity55 6 ( @entity56 71 ’ 5 ) subs not used : @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 manager : @entity63 , 6.5 @entity5 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : @entity64 6.5 ; @entity65 6 , @entity66 6.5 , @entity67 6.5 , @entity68 6.5 ; @entity69 6.5 , @entity70 6.5 ; @entity71 7.5 ( @entity72 81 ’ ) , @entity25 7 , moses 6.5 ( @entity73 86 ’ ) ; @entity31 6.5 subs not used : @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 manager : @entity81 , 7 referee : @entity83 attendance : 31,772 @entity25 scores the only goal of the @entity86 his cost of £ 500,000 last summer continues to look a steal of @entity89 proportions			1
@entity81 did not shun the chance to fan the flames of self - praise			2
‘ the figure we paid takes people aback given some of the figures bandied about , ’ he said			0
‘ you look at what we ’ve got for the money we ’ve paid — we ’ve done well			0
’ @entity25 survived @entity3 ’s rougher edges too			1
‘ he ’s a game little chap , he does n’t mind that , ’ @entity81 added , of the occasional robust challenge			2
‘ @entity106 will try to stop him but he has a low centre of gravity and great ability			0
’ @entity68 gets across to challenge @entity42 in a goalless first half @entity25 is sandwiched between @entity3 's @entity111 ( left ) and @entity42 ( right ) , but manages to get his shot away @entity3 's @entity51 clears the ball out of the path of @entity5 's @entity116 winger @entity71 @entity117 miles @entity3 111.7 69.4 @entity49 90 12.1 7.5 @entity50 90 11.4 7.1 @entity42 90 10.5 6.6 @entity5 113.6 70.6 @entity118 90 11.9 7.4 @entity25 90 11.7 7.3 @entity31 90 11.1 6.9 in truth this was one of @entity25 ’s quieter games , even as he recorded his fourth goal in 10 matches			1
@entity54 made his @entity3 debut in the second half following his £ 9.3million transfer from @entity127 and @entity63 will be pleased if his striker produces a similar goal ratio to the @entity130			1
having not played for a month though , the @entity131 had little impact			0
nor did @entity133 , thrown on with 19 minutes left as @entity3 chased a point			2
@entity5 could have gone ahead shortly before @entity25 ’s strike when @entity118 hit a sweet volley that saw @entity44 react swiftly to fist away			1
@entity3 ’s best chances came in the first half , through the pace and purpose of @entity51 down the left wing			1
in the 28th minute he picked out @entity42 who arrived on to the ball without breaking stride but drove his shot straight at @entity64 , who held gratefully			0
it was a similar story when @entity53 applied a smart backheel to another @entity51 cross later in the half			2
@entity51 was a surprise name in @entity63 ’s line - up given @entity152 left him out of their @entity155 squad on january 7 because of a knee injury they estimated would take three weeks to heal			0
but @entity63 clarified the situation with a swipe at the @entity160 , managed by @entity161			0
‘ he recovered in the time we said from the outset : 10 days to two weeks , ’ said @entity63			0
‘ he went down to @entity165 to have independent medical scans organised by the @entity160 fa			0
if they have any problems they need to look at their own administrators , not anything to do with me			0
‘ he ’s our footballer and we abide within the rules			0
if their manager wants to say anything , quite frankly i could n’t care less			0
’ @entity3 midfielder @entity50 brings the ball forward and fends off @entity5 's @entity70 @entity55 brings down and controls the ball ahead of the oncoming @entity65 @entity71 has a shot at goal , but sees his effort blaze wide minutes later , however , @entity5 find the breakthrough as @entity25 scores with a clever finish past @entity44 @entity65 surges forward for @entity5 but is tackled by @entity51 late on @entity3 boss @entity63 will not relish his side 's upcoming fixtures with @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18			1

@entity25 scored the goal as @entity5 edged @entity3 in a tight game at the @entity40
