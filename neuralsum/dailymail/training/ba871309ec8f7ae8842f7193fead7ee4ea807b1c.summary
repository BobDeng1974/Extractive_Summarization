by @entity0 the family of @entity3 teenager @entity2 said her ' healing begins ' today after doctors successfully fitted her body with breathing and feeding tubes			1
@entity9 , her mother , claimed the 13 - year - old ’s body was fitted with a tracheostomy to her windpipe and a gastrostomy to her stomach this morning			1
she said the procedure meant that her daughter was getting the nutrition she needed for the first time since she was declared brain dead a month ago			0
scroll down for @entity20 long road to recovery : @entity2 is making progress after being declared brain dead last month it also meant that she could be ' kissed on the lips ' without a ventilator tube being in the way			1
a spokesman for family said : ' doctors are optimistic that her condition has stabilized and that her health is improving from when she was taken from @entity34			1
' @entity2 suffered massive brain damage while recovering from an operation to remove her tonsils at @entity34 , in @entity3 , on december 9			1
bleeding from the teenager 's throat caused her heart to stop and , while doctors were able to resuscitate her , the resulting brain damage was so severe they declared her brain dead three days later			2
but the family disagreed with the doctors and successfully won a court order preventing the hospital from turning off her life support			0
they then organized for @entity2 to be removed on sunday to a secret facility in order to receive long - term care			1
at first reports said that the condition of her body was worse than first thought due to lack of nutrition , and that an operation to secure feeding and breathing tubes was proving difficult			0
hope : @entity9 says she can now kiss her daughter as a ventilator tube has been moved optimistic : @entity64 , with pictures of her and granddaughter @entity2 , who is stabilizing since she has been moved to a different medical facility but today the family posted that it had been carried out successfully and they were still hopeful she could heal			1
her mother posted : ' @entity2 had surgery this morning and it was successful ! ! now i can kiss her lips without that damn tube in the way and now she can get nutrition ! ! ' thank you @entity80 ! my child will heal			1
' @entity2 ’s sister added that she will be ' finally receiving nutrition ' for the first time since december 8			2
' we are praying for a strong recovery , ' she wrote			0
despite the success of the operation , the family admitted that she remained in poor shape and her body has yet to be stabilized			0
@entity93 , the lawyer who helped the family stop the hospital turning off @entity2 's life support machine , hit back at criticism he had deceived a poor grieving family			2
mr @entity93 had been accused of being ' heartless ' by the hospital for having a ' reckless disregard for the truth ' and perpetuating the ' hoax ' that @entity2 could recover			2
' the whole thing about me giving them false hope is a construction of public relations because they needed a villain , ' mr @entity93 said			0
steps to recover : @entity112 , pictured with @entity2 's grandmother @entity64 , are praying for @entity2 to make a full recovery ' not only that but it is patronising to @entity2 ’s family if not bordering on racist : these minority people are being deceived by this white lawyer , it was they seemed to be saying			2
' the family made the decision			0
this case was about who decides what happens to a child , the parents or doctors			0
' i always said there was very little hope she will recover but this family needed to be able to fight for this girl , ' he added			0
