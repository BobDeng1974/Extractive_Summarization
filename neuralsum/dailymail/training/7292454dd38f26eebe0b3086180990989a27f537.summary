lifelong @entity1 fan @entity0 could wear the club ’s iconic no 7 shirt vacated by @entity4 - with @entity6 winger @entity5 picking another number ahead of his £ 20million move to @entity9			1
@entity5 will meet club officials in @entity11 on sunday and is expected to complete his transfer in the next 72 hours to become @entity14 ’ fourth signing of the summer and the first of the @entity17 era			1
the @entity19 ’s £ 75million departure to @entity20 has led to huge interest over who will wear no 7 next season – a jersey made famous by @entity25 and @entity26			1
that leaves the door open for 32 - year - old @entity0 to complete a fairytale having been released by his hometown club as a youngster			2
the striker wore no 7 for his former club @entity44 but no decision was taken about his shirt number for @entity1 until the @entity4 saga was settled			1
now , @entity48 - born @entity0 will discuss the situation with manager @entity14 and decide between them if the extra significance of the jersey will work for both sides			2
however , it is unlikely @entity0 would want to turn down such a historic opportunity having made an emotional return to @entity11 this summer after coming through the ranks at @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 and @entity44 , and going on to play for @entity62 in the @entity63			0
@entity20 bound : @entity4 's move to @entity20 has freed the no.7 shirt at @entity9 following the sale of @entity4 , @entity14 is looking to strengthen his squad in a number of areas ahead of the club ’s @entity71 campaign for five years			1
@entity74 ’s @entity73 is just one of a number of options being looked at in attack with @entity79 @entity63 striker @entity78 still to decide whether he wants to sign for @entity1 from @entity80 , though he would be loaned back to the @entity82 club right away			0
@entity44 and @entity84 defender @entity83 remains a target too , though his club are so far refusing to sell			0
@entity14 also wants a left - back with @entity88 from @entity74 among his options			0
meanwhile , @entity4 may not even set foot in @entity62 again following his move to @entity92			2
banned from any training ground for four months following his bite on @entity97 in the @entity63 , there are no plans yet for the player to say farewell in person to his former team - mates			0
@entity4 lived in a plush rented home next to @entity105 - made famous by @entity106 - in south @entity1 but could arrange for the removal of all his belongings without going back in person			1
ironically , @entity20 are preparing for their pre-season at @entity62 ’s hq in @entity112 but @entity4 can not play until october and is prohibited from taking part in any football activity until then .			0

@entity4 's £ 75m move to @entity118 *giants* has freed the no 7 jersey at @entity9
*boyhood* @entity1 fan @entity0 could follow in *footsteps* of heroes @entity26 and @entity25 by wearing the shirt
reds are also close to signing @entity5 for £ 20m from @entity6
