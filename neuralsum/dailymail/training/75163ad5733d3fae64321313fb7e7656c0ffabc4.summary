a man who was trapped inside his body for years following a mystery childhood illness has revealed how he overcame unimaginable hurdles to become independent again - and find love			1
@entity5 , who grew up in @entity6 and now lives in @entity7 , was just 12 when he slipped into an inexplicable comatose state and spent the next dozen years trapped inside his body			1
speaking to the today show in his first @entity11 television interview , he showed how far he has come since doctors realized he was aware of his surroundings - including completing a degree , learning how to drive and getting married			1
' i thought , " i have so much love inside of me and nobody to give it to " , ' the 39 - year - old recalled , using a computer to speak			1
' it is hard to explain but you just know , ' he said			2
' i had heard people say that and always thought " yeah right " until it happened to me			2
' @entity27 , who sat beside him during the interview , said she felt it too			1
' [ @entity43 ] had such a nice smile and i just thought he 's really attractive , ' she said			0
' he seemed like such a kind person			0
' the couple , who married in 2009 , are now hoping to start a family			1
@entity5 is able to have biological children , his wife said			1
it is a life that , 20 years ago , his family never could have imagined he would have			1
one day in january 1988 , when he was 12 , he was sent home early from school with a sore throat and his condition quickly deteriorated			1
his mobility was the first to go , followed by his memory , and he was left completely unresponsive			2
his muscles wasted away and his hands and feet curled in on themselves			0
before : @entity5 is pictured ( second right ) with his parents and siblings before he was taken ill in 1988 bizarre : doctors were unable to explain why he had fallen ill. he was left unable to communicate or move doctors were never able to conclusively pinpoint the exact cause , but cryptococcal meningitis was the most likely culprit			1
' we were told to take him home and take care of him until he died , ' his father told the today show			1
but a couple of years later , @entity5 started becoming aware of his surroundings again even though he could not tell his family			1
he said he would attempt to move but it would go unnoticed			0
' for so many years , i was like a ghost , ' he told the today show from his @entity78 home			1
' i could hear and see everything , but it was like i was n't there			0
' every day , his father would take him to a care center for eight hours , return at the end of the day and then take him home to be bathed and put to bed			2
he said the powerlessness was terrifying			0
' every single aspect of your life is controlled and determined by someone else , ' he said			0
' they decided where you are , what you eat , whether you sit or lie down , in what position you lie in , everything			0
' for days on end when he was 17 and 18 , he would be put in front of the children 's television show ' @entity102 ' , and he says the thought of the purple dinosaur is still painful for him			2
overwhelmed : @entity5 ' parents , @entity106 and @entity107 , were unaware that their son started to understand them when he was about 16			1
at one point , @entity107 told him that she hoped he would die struggle : when he was 26 , a nurse realized that he seemed to understand her and told his parents to get him tested			1
it emerged that he did understand and slowly he re-learned how to read and communicate again ' @entity102 played , i guess you could say , a tormenting role in my life , ' he said			0
' for years , i would get flashbacks and have nightmares			2
' instead , he tried to pass the time by looking at how the seasons changed , how the light moved across his room or how plants grew			0
his inner life kept him busy , he said			0
' i used to live in my mind , ' he said			2
' i 've had conversations with myself and other people all in my head			0
i 'd imagine i was doing all sorts of things			0
' his condition also caused pain for his family			1
one night , his mother told him that she hoped he died			2
she did not know that he could hear it			0
@entity5 said he is n't angry at his mother for what she said			2
' i felt only love and compassion for my mother , ' he said			0
' my mother often felt that she was n't a good mom and could n't take care of me			0
one of the hardest things for me was i could n't tell her that , ' no , you are doing great '			0
' eventually , in 2001 , a new worker at his care center started sitting with him every day , and noticed that he was giving her small signals that suggested he was aware of his surroundings			1
at age 26 , @entity5 passed a test by identifying pictures of various items with his eyes			1
love of his life : in 2008 , he met @entity27 , pictured , and she said she was immediately drawn to his smile by his side : the couple married in 2009 and live in @entity7 , where they hope to start a family soon fighter : the couple chat with @entity171 reporter @entity170 at their @entity78 home			1
@entity5 uses a computer , pictured , to help him speak			1
he said it came with an @entity11 accent but he changed it to @entity6 @entity107 , his mother , quit her job as a radiographer and spent the next two years helping @entity5 master a computer program that enabled him to communicate			1
' i do n't think i will ever forget that feeling when my mom asked me what i 'd like for supper and i said , " @entity186 , " and then she actually made that			0
i know that must seem insignificant , but for me , that was amazing , ' he said			0
he had to learn everything again , including reading and how to have a conversation			0
he was also soon able to use a wheelchair and drive in a car that operates with his hands , and enrolled in a university to study computer science			2
he now works as a web designer and in 2011 , he released his autobiography , @entity200			0
but for him , the greatest joy was meeting @entity27			2
' i probably have a somewhat unique perspective on life , i appreciate it a lot , ' he told the today show , with a smile across his face			1
' the simple things ... to have someone to share your life with , simply to cherish life			0
