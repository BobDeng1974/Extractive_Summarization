fashion week came and went quicker than you can say @entity2 but it is n't just on the catwalk that new trends are born			1
behind the scenes , the most talented hair and make - up artists in the world work like a well - oiled machine to set the next season 's beauty trends - and if they have anything to do with it , we 'll be wearing fake freckles , smudged lipstick or perhaps even no make - up at all			1
@entity17 went backstage to meet the hotbed of talent conjuring up @entity21 's beauty looks and we can assure you that you 'll be getting creative in six months ' time			1
@entity30 's show was case in point			2
@entity27 ' @entity26 created what he calls ' mermaid hair ' , which was slicked back using gel , a recurring theme backstage this season			1
for two of @entity30 's models - the show 's brides - @entity26 braided the lengths around the nape of the neck and attached delicate sections of lace to the crown with double - sided stick tape			2
@entity26 said : ' we wanted something very modern and strikingly different			2
' pipping @entity26 in creating something different was the creative team over a @entity62			2
while most stylists went for a sleek , easy ponytail , or a graphic , urban one like @entity67 's at @entity68 , the team backstage at @entity62 's show transformed it into a sort of elephant 's tail using black string			1
a variation on the ponytail : over at @entity76 , the classic ponytail , which was omnipresent at fashion week , was transformed into an elephant tail perhaps the quirkiest look of @entity81 was @entity82 's for @entity83			1
dubbed ‘ @entity89 ’ and inspired by rave - wear , each model was styled as a 90s raver with twisted and knotted hair piled into bows and bunches			0
at @entity91 , it was all about glitz and glamour and the team created a modern tiara with a centre parting and lots of glitter spray			0
centre partings reigned supreme at @entity100 as well where @entity67 created ' childlike ' hair			0
models ' natural hair texture and colour shone through and was punctuated only by a precise centre parting - a style we spotted on numerous catwalks			0
save it for a rave : ' @entity89 ' with twisted and knotted hair piled into bows and bunches was created at @entity83 's show dazzling : at @entity91 , it was all about glitz and glamour and a centre parting and lots of glitter spray were the order of the day if fiddly plaits , hair lace and glitter spray are too much for you to fathom , fear not			0
plenty of stylists opted for effortless , loose waves			0
our favourite style came courtesy of @entity132 's @entity131 global hair ambassador @entity82 who created the ‘ woodstock waves ’ at @entity134 inspired by the free spirited festival girl the collection was based around			0
at @entity138 , he styled hair into ' the flirtatious bounce ' to ooze a glamorous @entity142 vibe			0
the look was designed to look ' undone ' with voluminous waves creating a understated look that bounced along the catwalk to the cool , hip hop soundtrack			0
achievable hair : @entity150 rocks the ' @entity152 waves ' at @entity134 inspired by the free - spirited festival girl the collection was based around nails at @entity157 designer @entity156 's showcase , @entity159 nail technician @entity158 created metal nails inspired by @entity162 : @entity163 , a @entity165 deity			0
she painted nails chrome silver layered with a semi sheer finish and decorated with chain and diamente embellishments for one tough luxe look			0
how do you text ? at @entity156 , @entity175 nail technician @entity158 created metal nails decorated with chain and diamente embellishments for one tough luxe look @entity177 marks the spot : nails were rebellious and butter @entity181 technicians scrawled graphic symbols onto them fashion can come across oh - so - serious sometimes but we can always rely on design trio @entity186 , @entity187 and @entity188 to put the fun back into it			1
the three designers , aka sibling , are as well known for their fun sensibility as their love of knitwear and they 're beauty look followed suit			1
inspired by 80s @entity204 style , as depicted through the lenses of acclaimed photographers @entity201 and @entity202 , models played dress up with huge bows worn on their heads			0
nails were notably rebellious and butter @entity181 technicians scrawled graphic symbols found on @entity213 's tribal inspired jewellery onto nails			0
make - up in some cases , it was a case of more is more			0
backstage at @entity83 , @entity219 created the look and it was as daring as the shoes			1
taking on a @entity227 masked beauty theme , the models ' faces were chalked up white to create an ancient tribal feel			1
eyes followed suit and were darkened with lashings of black eyeliner juxtaposed against vibrant flashes of blue , yellow , orange or purple underneath the eyes aiming to embrace each girl ’s individuality			0
@entity239 counts as make - up too , especially thanks to @entity244 's latest product : the first - ever @entity241 wash off tan			0
who needs make - up ? a model backstage at the @entity156 show can be seen wearing an ornate @entity249 by @entity250 @entity26 created the ' hacienda tan ' , inspired by the @entity253 raves of the 80s and 90s at @entity83 's show			1
' it 's designed to look as though they 've been at an acid house rave , ' he told us backstage			1
' i used lots of moisturiser to create a dewy look and used my new @entity265 on top			0
it 's ideal because it hides imperfections but is water - resistant and sweat - proof , perfect for those all - night raves ! '			0
the glow giver also trialled his new product backstage at @entity275 , whose collection was inspired by the @entity277 and @entity278 - think a young @entity279			1
' this season 's must have tan is wet - look poolside chic , glowing and glossy with an overall dewy fresh look , ' added @entity26			0
@entity283 may have made waves when they unveiled the freckle pencil but it 's going south next summer			0
@entity287 sprinkled their way into the top skin finishing trends with a beachside @entity239 at @entity291 by @entity292			1
' to tie in with the make up , we added just a breath of base colour to the body , then took the delicate dusting of freckles down from the face onto the chest , arms and legs , ' said @entity303 , @entity304			0
could you pull this look off ? backstage at @entity83 , @entity219 created the look , which took on a @entity227 masked beauty theme eye wise , models were often seen sporting graphic , double - lined eyeliner created using masking tape ( a handy trick from @entity315 )			1
brows are still big news - we still blame @entity2 - and at @entity30 they were brightened with a dust of gold eyeshadow by @entity27 ' @entity321			1
' it 's all about washes of colour across the eyes , it 's very wearable , ' she told us backstage			1
at @entity327 , ‘ handsome ’ , bushy , groomed brows were the order of the day			1
while they paid lots of attention to brows , @entity27 beauty buffs teamed them with flushed cheeks and glossy lids			1
the @entity336 girl , including @entity337 , rocked bold brows created by @entity339 's @entity315 who said it 's important to work with what you 've got			1
at @entity344 and @entity345 , brows were brushed up to create more volume			1
the @entity2 effect is still gowing strong : at @entity327 , ' handsome ' , bushy , groomed brows were the order of the day @entity349 nice : over at @entity350 , while the skin was kept minimal , it was the lip that took centre stage			1
here shows @entity354 and @entity2 being beautified perhaps the biggest - and most wearable - beauty trend is berry lips			1
they were absolutely everywhere this season but throw out your lip liner because it 's all about the blurred lines			0
@entity17 went backstage ahead of the @entity350 show and watched @entity2 and co be beautified by @entity283 's mastermind make - up artist , @entity364			1
while the skin was kept minimal , it was the lip that took centre stage			0
‘ lips are effortless , with a pop of colour and a just kissed glow			2
the whole look is designed to look like the girls have done it themselves on the bus , they do n't care if their lipstick is smudged , ' said @entity364			2
it 's easy - and purse - friendly - to do yourself at home			0
use your finger to help create two textures , firstly pat on @entity383 in @entity384 , before applying @entity385 in @entity386 in the same fashion creating a deep burgundy colour on the lips			1
with a clean finger , smudge around the lips to achieve an intense finish with a soft diffused edge and voila , lips a @entity2			2
lips were lovely over at @entity397 as well			2
developed by @entity397 make - up artistic consultant @entity399 the look featured natural , dewy skin with a huge focus on the deep ruby red lips that were slightly matte			2
bold : @entity397 make - up artistic consultant @entity399 created dewy skin with a huge focus on the deep ruby red lips that were slightly matte at @entity397 good news for the ladies who do n't know the difference between a bb cream and a foundation because some make - up artists practically shunned make - up alltogether			1
make - up maestro @entity414 went for absolutely zero make - up at the @entity416 show in @entity204 , opting to spend time on skincare instead , and it seems that he brought it to @entity181			0
@entity422 , using @entity421 , created a fresh faced , iridescent and luminous look at @entity424 and @entity321 went for a ' beautifully organic ' look for @entity426			0
at @entity428 , @entity427 said that relaxed catwalk collections needed to be met with equally relaxed beauty			2
the result is bare - faced beauty that is actually extremely achievable and requires most attention on building up a healthy complexion			2
' the beauty is very much skin based ' says @entity427 , adding ' we wanted to create sport - glossy skin that looks effortless			2
' when describing how to get the look @entity427 explains that using a balm can help achieve the glossy look the girls had on the runway			0
' we have just used tinted moisturiser and a super balm on the lips eyelids and eye brows			1
' here 's to a beautiful @entity449			0
spot on ? @entity287 sprinkled their way into the top skin finishing trends with a beachside @entity239 at @entity291 by @entity292 barely there : @entity422 , using @entity421 , created a fresh faced , iridescent and luminous look at @entity424			2

@entity17 went backstage at fashion week to *identify* key beauty trends
smudged berry lips and slick ponytails are big news
brows still important and are best brushed up or dusted with eyeshadow
