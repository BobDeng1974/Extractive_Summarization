by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 has his pick of foreign clubs after @entity5 emerged as clear favourites ahead of @entity7 , @entity8 and @entity9 in what has turned into quite an international auction for the @entity13 under 21 winger			1
none of which will be of much consolation to @entity17 , of course			2
they stand to lose up to £ 8million if the player moves abroad , bringing to an end an increasingly bitter relationship between the @entity23 club and 22 - year - old @entity2 , his father @entity24 – the former @entity13 captain and @entity17 manager – and their advisors			1
even though @entity2 ’s contract at @entity29 is about to run out , @entity17 would receive substantial compensation from a tribunal if he joins another @entity33 club because he is under 23			1
wanted man : @entity5 are favoruites ahead of @entity7 and @entity8 to sign @entity2 this summer that scenario can not be ruled out amid interest from @entity38 , @entity39 and @entity40 , but they are unlikely to want to pay £ 8m – the estimated figure based on the £ 1.5m fee @entity44 paid @entity17 to take @entity2 on loan for the second half of last season			1
however , the compensation @entity17 receive will plummet to just £ 155,000 if @entity2 follows in his father @entity24 ’s footsteps to the @entity51 or joins another foreign club			1
@entity2 ’s situation was already complicated because @entity17 had agreed to pay @entity54 a 35 per cent cut of any sell - on fee for the player when they signed him from @entity60 for £ 500,000 three years ago			2
all smiles : @entity2 and father @entity24 ( second right ) flew into @entity5 's @entity63 on sunday and were given a tour of the club 's facilities on monday with chairman @entity67 determined to bank a net figure of £ 6m from any transfer , that pushed the club ’s overall valuation of @entity2 above the £ 8m mark and scared off a number of suitors last summer , including @entity54 themselves			1
@entity76 offered @entity17 £ 8.5m and @entity2 £ 35,000 - a - week , but he turned down a move to @entity78 to stay in the northwest with his newborn baby daughter			2
decision : @entity2 initially stayed with @entity17 after turning down @entity76 the final twist came when a furious @entity83 was sacked as @entity17 manager by @entity85 via text message in january			2
it followed reports that the club were unhappy @entity24 had allegedly taken time off to drive his son to hold talks with @entity8 before attending a two - day coaching course at @entity94			2
@entity2 did not play for the club again and joined @entity44 on loan shortly afterwards , scoring one goal in eight appearances			1
so do @entity2 ’s plans to move abroad now amount to payback ? he and his father would claim with some justification that the chance to play for @entity5 , where @entity24 and the his family spent two years in the mid- 90s following a £ 7.5m move from @entity106 , or any of the other foreign options on the table is simply too good to turn down			1
they flew into the city ’s @entity63 on sunday night and were given a tour of the club ’s facilities on monday before discussing personal terms with @entity5 owner @entity115 and technical director @entity116			1
‘ this is an incredible story , ’ said @entity24			0
‘ it ’s incredible that @entity2 is here at 22 , and he was five back then			0
i spent a beautiful time here			0
‘ the important thing for @entity2 is to be here today , to see the training ground , get to know the stadium and the city			0
then we will go back home and take a decision			0
i ’m here now for my son			0
i think we will know more in a couple of weeks			0
’ move abroad : @entity129 joined @entity5 in 1995 and spent two seasons playing for the @entity132 giants @entity2 admitted he is tempted by playing at the @entity51 where he watched his dad star alongside some of the biggest names in world football			1
‘ i ’m not an @entity5 player yet but i ’m very happy to be here two or three days in the meantime , ’ he said			0
‘ @entity5 have a fantastic squad and @entity132 is a great country where i have many fond memories			0
they are one of the most important clubs in the world			0
