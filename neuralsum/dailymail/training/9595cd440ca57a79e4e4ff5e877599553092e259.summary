by @entity0 perhaps one of @entity4 ’s lasting legacies , aside from his groundbreaking theories and revolutionary equations , has been his brain			2
since his death on 18 april 1955 scientists have studied , probed and analysed the organ that was inside the head of one of the greatest minds of the modern era			2
and previously it had been thought that his abnormal genius was due to a different or enlarged brain - but new research suggests that was n’t the case , and his brain was just like the rest of humanity			2
claims that @entity4 may have had a unique brain , which accounted for his great intellect , are wide of the mark according to a new study			1
it suggests that previous research of the genius 's brain were flawed and do n't actually prove there was anything special about it in 1985 , a study by @entity34 claimed that @entity4 ’s brain had a much higher number of glial cells than those of a more moderate intellect			1
he proposed there was an elementary particle responsible for transferring light - the photon			0
he developed his theory of special relativity , which described how time slowed as an object or particle approached the speed of light			0
his famous mass - energy equivalence equation , more commonly known as e = mc² , suggested matter was a form of energy			0
this led to the development of nuclear power and nuclear weapons			0
meanwhile , his theory of general relativity linked space and time interact with each other , known as space - time			0
glial cells , also known as neuroglia , are those that provide support and protection for neurons in the brain , with an increase in them thought to possibly indicate a higher brain power			0
but new research by dr @entity75 of @entity76 in @entity77 suggests this and other studies were flawed - and there was actually nothing special about the brain at all , reports @entity84 ’s @entity83			1
@entity4 ’s brain is itself a cause of some controversy - upon his death in 1955 it is rumoured that he had requested his entire body be cremated			1
but pathologist @entity92 was keen to preserve the greatest mind of a generation , and instead removed the brain just seven and a half hours after his death			0
although at the time this was against the wishes of the theoretical physicist , his son @entity96 later gave his blessing for the brain to be used for science according to @entity103			0
this led to that inaugural study in 1985 , on which @entity92 was a co-author , and since then numerous other scientists have suggested @entity4 ’s brain was special in some regard			1
in his new paper , however , dr @entity75 disagrees			1
a specimen of @entity113 physicist @entity4 's brain is seen in a glass slide at an exhibition at the @entity116 in @entity117 on 27 march 2012			1
since his death in 1955 @entity4 's brain has been meticulously studied , but scientists are apparently no closer to finding out what made him so smart first , he says of 28 tests done in 1985 comparing @entity4 ’s brain to other ‘ control ’ brains , only one was deemed significantly accurate by the researchers at the time			1
furthermore , claims dr @entity75 , other microscopic analyses ‘ found essentially no differences between his brain and that of the controls ’			1
the studies were famously performed with slices of @entity4 ’s brain , but of that dr @entity75 said : ‘ to believe that the analyses of one or a few tiny slices of a single brain could reveal anything related to the specific cognitive abilities of that brain is naïve ’			1
he suggests that observers should perform a ‘ blind test ’ of @entity4 ’s brain and others , to see if they notice anything that makes it stand out			0
‘ if there are actual differences , such an experimental methodology would reveal them , ’ writes dr @entity75			2
@entity4 also famously once wrote himself that he thought he had a great degree of control over his brain – he said his thoughts were not only visual , but muscular as well			0
again , however , dr @entity75 debunks these comments as worthless in actual neuroscience , saying it is not possible to perform accurate research of his brain based on a few things he said			1
it seems in death , after life , @entity4 continues to confound scientists across the world of all disciplines			0
one of @entity4 's most famous equations was the mass - energy equivalence ( pictured ) that proposed matter was a form of energy			2
this led to the creation of the first nuclear weapons , of which @entity4 once said : ' i know not with what weapons @entity174 will be fought , but @entity175 will be fought with sticks and stones '			0

previous studies have suggested that @entity4 had an abnormal brain
but a new study by dr @entity75 says that research may have been flawed
@entity4 's brain was ' stolen ' from his body hours after his death in 1955
it has since been studied *extensively* , with some claiming it was unique
some researchers say his ' special ' brain accounted for his greater intellect
