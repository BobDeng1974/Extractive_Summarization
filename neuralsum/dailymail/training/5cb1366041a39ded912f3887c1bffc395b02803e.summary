by @entity0 published : 00:00 est , 5 january 2013 updated : 08:25 est , 6 january 2013 the @entity1 is weighing a far - reaching package of legislation that would tighten restrictions on firearm sales and ownership by requiring universal background checks for gun buyers and creating a national database to track the weapons			1
gun rights advocates say the measures would crush private sales of firearms and lead to government confiscation of legally - owned guns			1
a group led by vice president @entity18 to study gun control is considering the various measures and compiling a list of them to send to president @entity23 before the end of the month			2
the group convened after 20 children and six adults were killed in a gun massacre at @entity28 last month			2
new laws : the @entity1 is weighing a far - reaching package of legislation that would tighten restrictions on firearm sales and ownership			2
gun rights activists say it would hurt sales at firearm shows like this one in @entity37 , @entity38 broader : the measures the @entity1 is considering are far broader than simply a reinstatement of an expired ban on assault weapons , which @entity23 has already said he would support @entity23 plans to review the recommendations and send his own package of proposals to @entity46			1
' this is not something that i will be putting off , ' @entity23 said on @entity51 ’s ' @entity50			0
' the measures the @entity1 is considering are far broader than simply a reinstatement of an expired ban on assault weapons , which @entity23 has already said he would support , the @entity53 's @entity52 reported saturday			1
' they are very clearly committed to looking at this issue comprehensively , ' @entity57 , president of the @entity58 , told the @entity53			0
@entity57 , who has been involved in the discussions , said the proposals under consideration are ' a deeper exploration than just the assault - weapons ban			2
' one such proposal would require universal background checks for all gun buyers and could put a dent in business at gun shows and online , according to gun rights activists			1
leader : @entity23 appointed vice president @entity18 to lead the effort in finding an effective way to tighten gun laws in the wake of the @entity28 shooting current law requires federally licensed gun dealers , such as @entity82 , to verify that a buyer has not been convicted of a serious crime or declared mentally incompetent before selling that person a gun			1
typically this is done online and takes less than a day			0
but private sellers , most of whom sell firearms online or at gun shows , are not subject to the same requirements			0
federal law requires private sellers to refuse a buyer if they suspect that person might not pass a background check			0
but no check is required and no paperwork is filed regarding the process			0
the @entity1 is considering reaching out to @entity82 and other gun retailers to help build public support for the universal background check , since the retailers could benefit from a potentially negative effect on private sales			1
tragedy : president @entity23 reacts as counterterrorism chief @entity110 briefs him at the @entity1 on the details of the shootings at @entity28 another proposal under consideration would create a national gun - tracking database , which gun rights advocates oppose because they believe it would lead to government confiscation of legally - owned firearms			1
the database would require that guns be registered or permitted			0
in a letter to sen. @entity123 , @entity124 , that went viral online last week , gun owner and @entity129 @entity128 explained his reasoning for opposing the database			0
' i will not register my weapons should this bill be passed , as i do not believe it is the government ’s right to know what i own , ' he wrote , expressing the fears of millions of gun owners			1
' nor do i think it prudent to tell you what i own so that it may be taken from me by a group of people who enjoy armed protection yet decry me having the same a crime			0
' opposition : gun owners like @entity129 corporal @entity151 , pictured , oppose a national database to track firearms @entity151 's argument is rooted in the foundation of the @entity157 , better known as the right to bear arms , which was originally established as a means to protect against tyranny			1
the powerful @entity162 insists that the answer to ending gun violence against innocents is in improving mental health care , an area that the @entity1 is also reviewing for potential legislative changes			0
' we ’re going to need to work on making access to mental health care at least as easy as access to a gun , ' @entity23 said in the aftermath of the @entity28 shooting			2
' we ’re going to need to look more closely at a culture that all too often glorifies guns and violence			0
' @entity178 , the 20 - year - old gunman who carried out the massacre at @entity28 , reportedly had a history of mental health problems .			2

president to push for law that *includes* universal background checks , creation of national database of gun owners
measures expected to come in addition to ban of assault weapons
pressure to act *swiftly* in response to @entity28
gun activists fear the laws - *decreasing* privacy - will hurt sales
