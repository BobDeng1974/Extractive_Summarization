by @entity0 for @entity1 the landscape is eerily similar to @entity3 , the fictional sixth planet featured in @entity5			2
and the camera angles make it seem as though there ’s a @entity5 film on screen			0
but it ’s the @entity13 ’s @entity12 on a low - level flight as it takes to the skies on a jaunt across the beautiful but desolate @entity18 landscape			1
the flight across the @entity18 ice sheet goes along the ice rim east of @entity22 to the dye - 2 radar station , over the inspection ship @entity25 , and over the town of @entity27 where the polar explorer @entity25 was born			1
the pilot signs off with a sharp salute before he begins his ascent towards the skies			0
the jet careens slowly and the aircraft slowly gathers speed , juddering as it races towards the end of the runway			1
the ground and surrounding landscapes recede into the distance as the jet takes off and meets the crystal clear blue skies			1
the pilot steers it to a 45 degree angle and the view from the cockpit changes , as the heavens above run parallel to the ground below			0
the @entity13 's @entity12 jet flies over @entity18 's stunning landscape flying friends : three other jets accompany the pilot as he speeds off into the skies there is another sharp , steep turn as the pilot shows off his skills			1
the turquoise waters of a lake reflect the hues of the clear and sunny day			0
the sun , a bright orb , gleams , its rays piercing through the heavy - duty cockpit shield			0
the scenery is breath - taking as cliffs rise out of the water			2
the pilot races ahead to catch up with another plane on the right but holds back at the last minute			0
soon there are three jets ahead , accompanying the aircraft on its journey across the pristine @entity18 landscape			1
the camera angle switches to reveal the pilot , his face covered in an oxygen mask and helmet as he nonchalantly slices the jet through the clear air			2
he looks behind , as if to say goodbye to the land before heading higher up towards the sky			0
the bright rays of the sun pierce through the sharp , blue skies as the @entity18 ice sheets sparkles below @entity91 covered hills on the left and a tiny speck of another jet against green hills on the right what a view : @entity100 blue waters and white ice clouds engulf the plane , obscuring the view until once again the f - 16 climbs , leaving its cloudy prison and the scenery is visible once more			1
an icy expanse awaits below , with icebergs poking out through the water			2
shards of ice twinkle in the sunlight , ethereal against the dark waters			0
the pilot waves at inspection ship @entity25 below and zooms past , heading towards land			1
a speck in the sky turns out to be another jet			2
the @entity12 picks up speed and the ground whizzes past , showing craggy ice blocks with breaks in between , where icy blue waters peek out and winding around the landscape			1
the barren ground below looks cold and uninviting but the views are spectacular			0
melted ice form pools on the ground before the scene shifts to a pristine , snowy landscape as the plane rockets by , heading towards lush green hills			1
in a matter of minutes , the plane lands smoothly on the runway and comes to a halt .			0

@entity12 jet zooms along the *starkly* beautiful landscape of pristine snow
aircraft flies past icebergs , vivid blue pools of water and green hills
flies over @entity153 town , the *birthplace* of polar explorer @entity25
