from the @entity0 and @entity1 of @entity3 's 2011 wedding to the 2012 @entity4 , no royal event would be complete without them			1
now a trickle of royal fans , some familiar faces among them , have begun arriving at the @entity10 ahead of the royal birth			2
but the group , which includes well - known royal enthusiast @entity13 , 71 , could be in for a long wait as the @entity16 's due date is more than a week away			2
getting ready : royal superfans @entity13 and @entity18 outside the @entity10 that , however , was n't enough to dampen spirits with the group , all of whom had come prepared with @entity25 flags , posing happily for the @entity27 pack			1
joining mrs @entity13 was another familiar face - that of self - confessed royal ' superfan ' @entity18 , 60 , who camped out overnight ahead of the @entity30 and was the only member of the public to attend every day of the inquest into the death of princess @entity35 in 2008			1
mr @entity18 , a former chef , said at the time he hoped to go down in history for the feat and told the @entity38 that he would n't be surprised ' if a portrait of me is hanging inside @entity41 in 100 years from now '			2
equally serious about the @entity42 is mrs @entity13 , an avid collector of royal memorabilia who has amassed a trove worth more than £ 10,000			1
nearly there : @entity1 of @entity3 , pictured last month , is due to give birth on the 25th april regular : @entity18 , 60 , has been present for every major royal event of the last 10 years @entity35 fan : his favourite was princess @entity35 and he attended every day of the 2008 inquest into her death mrs @entity13 , who gave birth to her son @entity54 at the @entity10 , says she considers the royals to be part of her family and has been following their exploits for more than 40 years			1
her collection of royal souvenirs , which includes a £ 1,200 bust of prince @entity62 , is so vast , it takes up four rooms in her small terraced home in @entity66			1
like mr @entity18 , mrs @entity13 was also at the @entity10 for the birth of @entity68 and ended up spending six days waiting for him to arrive			1
' i was there for six days , ' she told a recent episode of @entity72 show @entity73			0
' [ my son ] @entity54 was born at @entity75 and i was only there for two days			0
' i just wanted to feel close to them [ @entity77 and @entity16 ] , i suppose			0
i spent the time meeting people , and @entity80 was convinced it was going to be a girl , but it was n't			0
' she describes her collecting as a ' labour of love ' and says every day is dominated by her royal obsession			0
excited : mr @entity18 , from @entity87 , with @entity88 and her daughter @entity89 from @entity90 pole position : mrs @entity13 surveys the scene outside the @entity10 at @entity93 in @entity94 impressive collection : mrs @entity13 has filled four rooms of her small @entity66 home with memorabilia valuable : the collection is thought to be worth around £ 10,000 and is a ' labour of love ' ' there 's loads of royal magazines that i read , so i get up at about 4.30am to keep up with it all , ' she reveals			1
' i 'm retired but i do n't think i 've actually ever worked so hard in my life			0
it takes a lot of work [ to maintain ] but it 's a labour of love			0
' @entity1 of @entity3 is due to give birth to her second child on the 25th april , although experts say royal watchers could be in for a long wait as second babies tend to come late			2
nevertheless , preparations for the birth are well past the planning stages , with a media pen designed to hold the expected influx from around the world opening today			0
the police have also begun patrolling outside the @entity10 and have barred photographers from getting too close to the door			2
although the @entity1 herself is believed to be at @entity41 , her husband prince @entity77 is working in @entity128 and is expected to be forced to make a two - hour hospital dash when his 33 - year - old wife goes into labour .			0
