by @entity0 published : 20:28 est , 14 december 2012 updated : 20:28 est , 14 december 2012 @entity1 kept alive their bid for a spot in the knockout stages of the @entity5 with a hard - fought 15 - 3 win over @entity7 in a dire affair at rain - swept @entity9			1
@entity7 's solitary penalty leaves them with a dismal tally of only 12 points in matches after four @entity16 games			2
the @entity17 earned their win by virtue of their better haul from kicks at goal , with @entity23 booting four penalties and @entity25 one , while @entity7 's counter came from @entity27			2
the same two sides had served up a 95 - point thriller when they met in the same competition last season , with @entity7 posting a win that was instrumental in their progress to the semi-finals			1
@entity7 's @entity36 ( centre ) is tackled by @entity1 's @entity38 this encounter could scarcely have been further removed , with neither team producing any running rugby of note , and both wasting numerous scoring opportunities with the boot			1
with three minutes on the clock , @entity7 were guilty of crossing as they attempted to run the ball out of defence , and @entity25 steered the resultant kick between the sticks to open the scoring			2
the visitors doubled their advantage three minutes later when @entity23 thumped over a long - range penalty following an offence at a scrum just inside the @entity7 half			1
the hosts had barely featured in an attacking sense and their first visit of note to racing territory yielded a long - range penalty which proved to be just beyond the range of @entity27 , making his first start for the @entity69 outfit			0
@entity7 's @entity27 tackles @entity1 's @entity70 on a wet night the 22 - year - old had an opportunity to make amends 10 minutes later from a far more favourable position after an offence at the breakdown , but he fluffed his effort			1
the stand - off opened his account for @entity7 at the third time of asking , clipping over a penalty from 25 metres after 27 minutes			1
but he squandered an opportunity to square matters after 32 minutes when he was wide with another straightforward effort after a bustling run by @entity86 had earned another penalty			0
@entity25 was evidently afflicted by the same malaise , missing a chance to extend his side 's lead just before half - time			0
@entity7 's @entity93 is tackled by @entity1 's @entity94 at a rainy @entity9 @entity23 , too , was off target shortly after the restart when his attempt on goal rattled the woodwork			1
@entity27 responded with his fourth miss of the night			0
the clock ticked past the 50 - minute mark without there having been any threat to either try line			0
inevitably the next change to the scoreboard came with the boot			0
a late tackle by @entity7 number eight @entity93 on @entity25 earned the @entity112 international a yellow card and @entity23 banged over the ensuing penalty from halfway to stretch the lead to six points			2
the scrappy nature of the contest continued			0
@entity7 had another chance to claw back three points after @entity121 offended , with the @entity1 prop earning 10 minutes in the sin bin for his troubles			1
@entity125 assumed the kicking responsibilities from the misfiring @entity27 , but the full - back fared no better			0
in response , @entity23 fired over his third three - pointer of the night , and having found his range he landed another effort with 12 minutes left to play , leaving the @entity69 12 points adrift and out of the game			0
it was even wetter in @entity136 , though , where @entity137 beat @entity138 17 - 0 in friday 's other match , @entity138 were unable to repeat their heroics of a week ago as @entity137 won 17 - 0 in horrendously wet conditions at the @entity142			1
man of the match @entity143 kicked an early penalty and converted @entity146 's 31st - minute try to give @entity137 the upper hand and a 10 - 0 interval lead in the @entity5 clash			1
there then followed a stop - start second half during which @entity152 and @entity153 caught the eye for the hard - working visitors			0
@entity137 were meandering to victory and put the finishing touches to a good night when @entity158 latched onto his own kick , taking advantage of a fortuitous bounce to put replacement centre @entity162 over in the final minute			2
@entity143 converted superbly with the last kick of the match , the result of which sees @entity137 leapfrog over @entity138 into second place with @entity169 looking like runaway winners of @entity171			1
the saturated pitch contained pools of water in certain areas but the ground staff cleared enough of it for the fixture to go ahead as scheduled			0
@entity137 's @entity181 number eight @entity179 vies with @entity138 's forwards @entity138 were expecting a backlash from the @entity181 giants , who sacked coaches @entity186 and @entity188 in the aftermath of their shock 22 - 14 defeat in @entity192			1
@entity193 and @entity194 were installed as an interim coaching tandem and they would have been pleased with @entity137 's @entity197 forwards rumbled into the @entity138 22 , winning two early penalties , with @entity143 sticking a third - minute kick through the uprights			1
as heavy rain continued , @entity138 dug their heels in and defended manfully with young full - back @entity203 secure under the high ball and the mud - covered pack competing in stout fashion			1
@entity137 had the first sight of the try line in the 12th minute , @entity209 sliding towards the right corner after set - piece ball was swung wide			1
however , the @entity213 international failed to get the ball down with the @entity138 cover doing just enough			0
it was a tough night for ball handling due to the wet and slippery conditions @entity219 , so influential with a 17 - point haul seven days ago , went the aerial route in a bid to give the visitors some momentum			1
@entity137 were territorially dominant though and exerted more control via clever kicking from @entity227 , @entity146 and @entity143			0
they made a breakthrough on the half - hour mark as they went left from a midfield scrum , with @entity158 's half break making the initial incision and @entity233 passing precisely for the supporting @entity146 to splash over in the corner			0
@entity143 supplied an excellent conversion from wide out			0
late on in the first half , @entity153 took out the @entity136 scrum - half off the ball , but @entity143 slid his resulting penalty effort to the left and wide			0
@entity137 's second row @entity242 ( centre ) takes on @entity138 's fly - half @entity219 ( right ) a sin - binning for @entity137 hooker @entity246 , who got involved in some afters with @entity248 , presented @entity138 with an opportunity to launch themselves forward			1
however , @entity219 sent a subsequent penalty from a difficult position wide and some handling errors robbed @entity138 of precious momentum in an evenly - fought third quarter			2
an injury to @entity138 centre @entity256 , who got an accidental knee to the head at a ruck , broke up play for a number of minutes as he was taken off on a stretcher			0
@entity264 ruined a good scoring chance for the home side with a sloppy pass , but they remained on the front foot despite losing replacement @entity270 to the sin bin			0
@entity137 pressed from a @entity274 surge into the westerners ' 22 and a five - metre scrum			2
@entity138 held out until @entity158 opened the way for @entity278 to power past @entity280 's last - ditch tackle in the left corner .			2
