by @entity0 published : 07:42 est , 17 march 2014 updated : 15:18 est , 17 march 2014 a @entity3 mother convinced she had been given the wrong baby at a hospital is suing health officials after she finally managed to organise a dna test - and discovered her suspicion was correct			1
@entity8 , 54 , from the city of @entity10 in the @entity11 , @entity3 , gave birth at hospital where her son was accidentally swapped with another baby boy born around the same time in 1986			1
after discovering the truth , ms @entity8 contacted @entity17 who had been given her son by mistake			1
but tragically , ms @entity8 found that her real son , who had been named @entity22 , had died in 2004 in a car accident when he was 18			2
tragic ending : @entity8 , 54 , ( pictured left ) discovered her son had been swapped at birth after 27 years			1
when she tracked down her biological son , @entity27 , ( pictured right ) she discovered he had already died in a car accident in 2004 when he was 18 complex relationship : the other mother , @entity17 , ( pictured right ) is now trying to build a relationship with her biological son @entity32 ( pictured left ) she said : ' i was at the hospital on july 3 , 1986			1
i knew as soon as they put the baby in my arms that something was not right			2
' i told them then that they had given me the wrong baby and refused to take it , but then a nurse and a doctor came to me and explained to me that it was impossible , as the baby had been given a special tag right after birth			0
' they pointed out that tag and told me it was just because i was tired after the ordeal of giving birth			0
they said that the baby and i would eventually bond			0
' i could n't shake off the feeling though , and my family did n't believe me either			0
we had a meeting where we decided that as we could n't afford any medical test to check if my feeling was right , i would have to accept the baby , and i raised him as my own			2
' by the time i learned about the possibility of a postal dna test and that we could afford it , it did not give me any satisfaction when it confirmed my suspicions , and it did n't give me back my real son			2
@entity17 , 56 , admits it has been difficult to come to terms with knowing the son she buried , @entity27 ( pictured left as a child and right when he was a teenager ) , was not actually her own child joint battle : both @entity8 ( pictured left ) and @entity17 ( pictured right ) are suing over the mistake			1
if successful , they plan to buy a house with the compensation money so their families can live together ' in fact , it took years of pressure for me to track down the mother of my boy			1
i could n't believe it when she told me that @entity27 had died in 2004			0
' the son she had raised , @entity94 , now aged 27 , has now met his real mother but said he did not feel any emotional connection to her			1
he admits he now feels lost and confused about the whole saga			0
he said : ' i always felt as if my mother who raised me was distant in some way , although she always did her best for me			0
yet now i know that my real mother was someone else i do n't feel that connection to her			0
' @entity17 , 56 , the biological mother of @entity104 , added : ' i lost my son and i buried him but with this bizarre twist i then found that actually it was n't even my son i buried - but then i was presented with a stranger and they are telling me this is my boy			1
mixed feelings : @entity32 ( pictured right ) admits he does not yet feel any emotional connection to his biological mother @entity115 ( pictured left ) experts believe the families are unlikely to win their legal battle because of the length of time that has passed since the error was made ' it is very difficult for all of us , the young man who is my son is certainly not warm towards me but i ca n't blame him for that			1
at best i get a lukewarm hello , and he has never called me mum like @entity127 used to			0
' both women are now suing over the error for more than one million rubles ( Â£ 16,400 ) in compensation and plan to buy a house where they can live together if successful			1
but experts say they are unlikely to win because of the length of time that has passed since the original mistake took place			2
according to @entity3 law , compensation payments incidents like this are only available for incidents that happened after 1991 when a new compensation law came into effect			0
but with the switch having happened in 1986 , compensation is only possible if those responsible are still alive and are actively obstructing those who are harmed			0
but the hospital say that in their case this is not so , and they are doing all they can to put matters right , although that does not include paying compensation .			0

@entity8 *'s* son was switched with another baby at a hospital in 1986
but she only confirmed the mistake with a @entity161 test 27 years later
by the time she tracked down her biological son , she found out he *'d* died
the woman who raised him , @entity17 , knew nothing of the mix - up
@entity115 is now trying to get to know her own biological son , @entity94 , aged 27
both women are now suing over the error for several thousand *pounds*
if successful , the women plan to use the money to buy a house together
