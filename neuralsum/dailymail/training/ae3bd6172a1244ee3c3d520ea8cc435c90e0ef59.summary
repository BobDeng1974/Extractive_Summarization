by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 10:09 est , 9 december 2013 updated : 10:27 est , 9 december 2013 sending a @entity3 card should be a chance to wish season 's greetings and make vague promises to catch up in the @entity7			2
but for political leaders it is increasingly a carefully choreographed , intensely observed photo opportunity to present themselves as a relaxed man of the people			2
labour leader @entity13 today released his smart - casual festive offering , featuring his wife and sons in a pose which would not look out of place in a mail order catalogue			1
labour leader @entity13 and his wife @entity20 take their children @entity23 ( left ) and @entity24 ( right ) for a walk along @entity27 beach , in a photograph chosen for his official @entity3 card the @entity13 family portrait shows mr @entity13 and wife @entity20 with their sons @entity23 and @entity33			1
it was taken during a walk along @entity27 beach at the start of the @entity38 conference earlier this year as the family headed out to a play park before the heavy political agenda got under way			1
in smart trousers and a grey pullover , mr @entity13 appears to be straining to look relaxed			1
when the pictures were taken in september it was noted that they were markedly different to @entity49 ’s refusal to be photographed with his own young children			2
but @entity38 strategists made clear that they wanted to give mrs @entity52 a more high profile role in a bid to give her husband a popularity boost			1
the release of the @entity59 's card comes after @entity60 revealed @entity62 ’s three - year - old daughter @entity61 has been given a starring role in the prime minister ’s official @entity3 card - for the second time			1
greeting : prime minister @entity62 and his wife @entity66 photographed with daughter @entity61 at 10 @entity68 for their 2013 @entity3 card the striking black and white portrait features mr @entity62 and wife @entity66 hugging their daughter inside @entity60 in october			1
the card will be sent around the globe to world leaders and dignitaries , as well as to senior figures in the @entity79			2
captured by award - winning photographer @entity81 , the picture shows the @entity82 ’ youngest child gripping her father ’s neck while she snuggles against her mother			0
@entity88 leader @entity87 it is striking that the three - year - old features so prominently because @entity62 has closely guarded his children ’s privacy since moving to @entity60 and usually requests that all photographs of them are pixelated			1
mr @entity62 has opted for a photograph of himself and wife @entity66 each year since taking power in 2010 , when they chose the photograph of the couple holding baby @entity61 on the steps of @entity60			1
the outspoken mep @entity102 does not take himself so seriously			1
after a year in which he has grabbed the headlines for outspoken comments about aid to ‘ @entity109 ’ and women being ‘ sluts ’ for not doing the cleaning properly , the 64 - year - old and his wife have posed for a self - mocking @entity3 card			1
@entity102 holds bongos in their @entity3 card and wife @entity116 does her best ' slut ' impression the @entity102 for @entity119 and the @entity120 , who quit the @entity79 @entity88 in september to sit as an independent , clutches bongos given to him by a music shop while his wife @entity116 is dressed as a ‘ slut ’			1
the photo , taken in the kitchen of the couple ’s house in a village near @entity130 , @entity119 , will be on cards posted to friends and family			2
but his old boss , @entity88 leader @entity87 , takes a very different view about the trend for political leaders to feature in their own cards			2
' rest assured , any cards sent from family @entity87 will be suitably festive rather than have my face on it , ' he said			2
@entity145 first minister @entity144 revealed his official @entity3 card last week , an imposing artwork of the fourth wise man who turned up too late to see @entity149			0
he opted for the bleak , sinewy painting of @entity151 by @entity145 artist @entity152			0
festive ? this painting of the fourth wise man @entity154 by @entity152 will grace the front of the first minister @entity144 's 2013 charity @entity3 card the artwork will be sold to raise money for charity , but some questioned whether its choice for a @entity3 card was not very festive			0
since 2007 mr @entity144 has raised £ 148,000 for charities in @entity145 through sales of the original artwork and limited edition prints of his official card			0
today he unveiled the @entity170 painting , which will be sold at auction in the @entity7 with the proceeds shared between the @entity173 ( @entity174 ) , @entity175 , @entity176 ( @entity176 ) and @entity177 , the charity chosen by the artist			0
he insisted the image of @entity151 is a ‘ hugely appropriate ’ work for his card			0
mr @entity144 said : ‘ the legend of @entity151 , or the fourth wise man , is based on a novel by @entity184			0
it tells the tale of a @entity188 scholar who , delayed by helping the vulnerable , follows the star to @entity190 but arrives just too late to herald the birth of the @entity193 child			0
‘ thirty years on in @entity194 , at passover , @entity154 is still searching			0
‘ now an old man , he parts with the last of his three gifts to @entity149 , a sapphire , a ruby and a pearl , to save a young girl from slavery			0
however , in a dying vision , @entity154 is comforted that his devotion to the distressed has secured him entrance to the kingdom of heaven			0
‘ the story reminds us that hope , faith and self - sacrifice are at the centre of the order of things .			0
