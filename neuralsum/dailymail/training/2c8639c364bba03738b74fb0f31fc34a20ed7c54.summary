' the @entity4 take on the @entity40 film is called ' a million ways to die in @entity4 's @entity42 , ' and it delves into the more insane ways people have died down under - such as tripping over cats or being mauled by the animals on our national emblem			1
@entity50 expert @entity49 said while many of the ways people have died on the list are true , there is also a number of long - held myths such as dying by drop attacks that tourists still believe happens			1
