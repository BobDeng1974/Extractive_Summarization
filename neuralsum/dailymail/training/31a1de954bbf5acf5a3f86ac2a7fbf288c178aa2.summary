by @entity0 published : 14:51 est , 9 october 2012 updated : 09:24 est , 10 october 2012 after facing huge criticism for blurred maps , @entity1 has received an unusual request - to make its maps more blurry			1
the technology giant came under fire for the poor quality of its maps after users found missing locations , areas obscured by cloud and even distorted bridges and roads			1
however , @entity16 officials found the maps too accurate - and have asked @entity1 to blur satellite images of sensitive military installations which are freely available to @entity21 users			1
part of @entity23 in @entity16 on @entity1 's maps - @entity1 has been asked to removed imagery of a secret base in the area			2
after widespread criticism of its maps app , @entity1 boss @entity28 was forced to make an embarrassing public apology over the firm 's flawed maps software			2
the company even changed the text on their website and no longer describes their problematic map application as ' the most beautiful , powerful mapping service ever '			1
the defence ministry reacted after the @entity42 newspaper printed a satellite picture , downloaded with an @entity21 , showing a top - secret long - range radar base in the northern county of @entity23			2
' regarding images taken by commercial satellites , legally we can do nothing about it , ' the ministry 's spokesman @entity46 told reporters			2
' but we 'll ask @entity1 to lower the resolution of satellite images of some confidential military establishments the way we 've asked @entity57 in the past , ' he said , referring to the @entity59 programme			1
@entity1 has not yet received a formal request , according to @entity61 , a @entity16 pr company handling its media relations			0
it declined to speculate how @entity1 would respond to a request			0
the @entity23 base houses a cutting - edge long - range radar procured from the @entity67 in 2003			1
construction of the radar is expected to be completed by the end of the year			0
the ultra-high - frequency radar , supplied by @entity67 defence group @entity73 , is capable of detecting missiles launched as far away as @entity75 in @entity77 's northwest , military officials say			1
they say the radar , which cost @entity16 $ 36 billion ( $ 1.23 billion and Â£ 769,000 ) , is designed to give @entity16 minutes of extra warning in case of a @entity77 missile attack			0
@entity16 experts estimate @entity77 currently has over 1,600 ballistic missiles aimed at the island			0
the number appears to have continued to rise despite improved relations since 2008 when @entity87 of the @entity77 - friendly @entity89 party became @entity16 's president			0
@entity91 still sees the island as part of its territory awaiting reunification , by force if necessary , even though @entity16 has governed itself since 1949 at the end of a civil war			0
a @entity16 army tank taking part in a military exercise in @entity23 , where a military installation has been revealed by @entity1 in its maps software @entity1 's view of @entity106 ( left ) is shrouded in cloud , while @entity57 ( right ) has a clear view			1
the firm was initially derided for its poor maps - now the @entity16 government has complained they are too accurate			0

@entity67 bases also appear on the service in high resolution
@entity57 has ' *muzzed* ' or distorted military installations
