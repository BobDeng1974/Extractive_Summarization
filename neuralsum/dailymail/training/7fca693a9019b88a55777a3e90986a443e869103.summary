@entity0 today confronted @entity2 leader @entity1 over her promise to have her @entity5 mps vote on the future of the @entity7			1
the prime minister used a meeting in @entity10 with the @entity5 first minister to make clear his anger at the idea that @entity15 laws should be decided by nationalists from north of the border			1
in his first speech in @entity5 since the independence referendum , mr @entity0 promised to make @entity21 one of the ' most powerful devolved parliaments in the world '			1
@entity0 today met first minister @entity1 to discus further devolution to @entity5 mr @entity0 's visit is designed to honour a ' vow ' made in the final days of the independence campaign to hand more powers to @entity5 if they decided to stay in the @entity29			1
but it has been overshadowed by ms @entity1 's shock plan to end its long - standing policy of not voting on devolved issues such as health and education			2
a new @entity37 poll for @entity38 found 52 per cent of @entity5 are planning to vote @entity2 in may			1
that would give the @entity40 an incredible 55 of @entity5 's 59 seats , with @entity42 reduced to a rump of only four @entity4 - with the @entity44 and the @entity45 completely wiped out			2
it would shatter @entity42 's hopes of an overall majority , and would leave @entity49 reliant on @entity2 votes to pass laws - including those which only affect @entity15			1
paving the way for a power - sharing deal with @entity42 , ms @entity1 insisted any vote on the @entity7 had knock - on effects in @entity5 because the @entity10 government ’s budget is linked to @entity62 spending			1
she said it was necessary to protect the @entity5 nhs from the knock on effects of cuts and privatisation in @entity15			2
the @entity2 leader told the @entity70 : ‘ we would be prepared to vote on matters of @entity15 health because that has a direct impact on @entity5 's budget			1
‘ so if there was a vote in the @entity78 to repeal the privatisation of the health service as has been seen in @entity15 to restore the @entity7 we would vote for that because that would help to protect @entity5 's budget			1
‘ if there are decisions taken to further privatise the @entity7 in @entity15 , and i do n't think anybody thinks the @entity44 are progressively privatising the health service in order to increase the public funding of the health service , so decisions are taken , that reduce over time the public funding of the health service in @entity15 then that has a direct knock on effect to @entity5 's budget			1
’ the prime minister visited new building work at @entity96 before setting out details of his pledge for more powers for the @entity21 @entity44 defence minister @entity100 branded the remarks ' complete twaddle ' and warned ms @entity1 was putting the @entity29 at risk again			1
' she does n't even understand what 's happened and this nonsense - and it is a nonsense - that the @entity106 are on some wide - scale privatisation of the @entity7			0
she puts our @entity29 at risk again and plays with dangerous stuff			0
' mr @entity0 sought to repaid the damage caused by the referendum campaign when he reveals the draft clauses that will underpin the devoltion of new powers to @entity5			1
the @entity44 leader stressed that these new powers are ' guaranteed ' , regardless of who wins may 's general election mr @entity0 promised the @entity21 will be able to ' combine the freedom to decide what happens in @entity5 's schools , hospitals , surgeries and police stations and the responsibility of determining how around 60 per cent of public money in @entity5 is spent '			1
he declared : ' the @entity21 will have more control of its tax and spending - making it one of the most powerful devolved parliaments in the world			0
' for the first time - the majority of the money the @entity21 spends will be raised right here in @entity5			2
' this includes a substantial new package of welfare powers - worth £ 2.5 billion - to tackle long term unemployment , disability and poverty			0
' we 've already moved to allow the @entity21 to extend its franchise so 16 and 17 year olds could vote at the 2016 @entity21 elections and here we are stating in law the permanence of the @entity21 - so there can never be any question : @entity21 is here to stay			0
' with @entity5 having voted to stay part of the @entity150 in last september 's independence vote , mr @entity0 claimed that decision ' was n't just about the future of devolution ' adding that people north of the border value ' the safety and security of being part of something bigger , our family of nations '			1
mr @entity0 said in the referendum campaign ' the leaders of the other main political parties and i promised extensive new powers for the @entity21 - a vow - with a clear process and timetable '			2
he added : ' we said a command paper would be ready by the end of october - and it was			0
' we said we 'd get cross-party agreement by @entity177 - and we did			0
' we said draft legislation would be published by @entity179 - and here we are , three days before the celebrations start , with those clauses before us			0
' but the @entity2 claims the new powers do not go far enough			0
@entity5 deputy first minister @entity183 , who was on the @entity184 along with representatives from @entity42 , the @entity106 , the @entity45 and the @entity186 , said : ' the proposals which mr @entity0 publishes today must live up to the word and spirit of the @entity184			2
@entity5 should not - and will not - accept anything less			0
' while the @entity184 recommendations did not go as far as we wanted , and do not live up to the ' vow ' made before the independence referendum , we welcome them , and they must now be delivered in full			1
' the latest @entity196 opinion poll suggests the @entity2 could will an incredible 55 of @entity5 's 59 seats , with @entity42 reduced to a rump of only four @entity4 - with the @entity44 and the @entity45 completely wiped out mr @entity183 said there is still ' a long way to go before these proposals are put into law '			1
he added : ' what we have today is the start of the process to develop a @entity206 which has widespread support for introduction shortly after this year 's general election			0
' we will be working closely with stakeholders to ensure these proposals are right for @entity5 and that they reflect the views of ordinary people			0
the @entity214 is focused on securing economic growth , tackling inequality and protecting our public services , and the new powers being delivered must help deliver those goals			0
' we will carefully examine today 's paper , because anything which backtracks , waters down or falls short of what lord @entity222 recommended would be unacceptable - and ultimately it is the people of @entity5 who will determine if these proposals go far enough			0
' chief secretary to the treasury @entity227 said after the referendum campaign ' as promised the @entity150 has today delivered unprecedented new powers for @entity5 , which make it one of the most powerful devolved administrations in the @entity232 '			2
the @entity45 said : ' the next steps are clear : the @entity214 and @entity21 will soon have these powers , and it needs to ensure that it implements them in a way that works for @entity5 , including by looking at further devolution within the country , as recommended by @entity222			2
' @entity240 does n't just mean the flow of powers from one @entity21 to another			0
devolution is about empowering our regions and our communities across @entity5 and the @entity150			0
