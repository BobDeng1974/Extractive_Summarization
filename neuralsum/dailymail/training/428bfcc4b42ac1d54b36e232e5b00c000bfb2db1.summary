others said ' your wife is an immigrant ' - a reference to mr @entity0 's @entity79 - born wife @entity78			1
outside the office one woman was seen breastfeeding , after mr @entity0 said mothers of newborn babies should avoid being ' openly ostentatious ' when breastfeeding			1

after spending almost two hours holed up in the office , mr @entity0 was led to safety by police under a large red umbrella mr @entity0 complained that everywhere he goes there are attempts to ' stop us engaging with the public ' the incident echoed when mr @entity0 was trapped in a pub in @entity97 in 2013 after being surrounded by protesters after finally managing to escape from the office , mr @entity0 was driven away while the police looked on ostentatious breastfeeding @entity0 sparked controversy when he backed @entity103 's in telling a breastfeeding customer to cover - up : ' it is n't too difficult to breastfeed a baby in a way that is n't ostentatious			1
' immigrants causing traffic jams the @entity6 leader missed a party event in @entity113 after getting stuck in traffic			1
his excuse ? ' it took me six hours and 15 minutes in the car to get here ... what is does have to do with is a country in which the population is going through the roof , chiefly because of open door immigration and the fact the @entity127 is not as navigable as it used to be			0

he told @entity156 's @entity155 : ' it 's the same as the rest of the country , to be honest with you , there is a trade - union attempt to stop @entity2 speaking ... ' everywhere we go there is an attempt to stop us engaging with the public			1
' he added : ' if you look , in fact you will see the two biggest unions in the country both directly contribute towards this campaign and , interestingly , amongst the protesters outside there are a couple of people who were @entity12 councillors until they lost their seats to @entity2			2
' he complained that the protest was ' not only undemocratic , it 's very anti-british '			2

' as for the crimes and the criminals themselves , i do hope – though i wo n't hold my breath – that the political elite that steered us blindly into this multiculturalism experiment have learned the lessons of what they think is ' tolerance ' but what is actually complicity			0

it 's like some sort of voyeuristic tourism tourism that 's going on			0
' i 'm very keen that we address the issue rather than point score			0
the fact that he came here with his circus and has ended up barricaded in his shop with people in @entity8 who are saying this is absolutely disgusting			0

this is the @entity12 running scared and trying to shut down any voice of opposition			0
