@entity248 , the @entity249 detective who led the investigation , agreed , telling @entity134 in the book that ' because of her upbringing , the sexual experiences , the abuse , and street smarts and toughness , she was much more advanced than the normal nine - year - old , and we believe that contributed to her survival			2
