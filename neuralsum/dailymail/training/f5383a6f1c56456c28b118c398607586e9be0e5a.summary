@entity13 , 28 , and @entity0 , 22 , grew up on the periphery of the @entity16 - dominated @entity15			1
the 300 - strong group , which controls the local drugs trade and is made up of mostly @entity19 , has long been the target of extremists seeking to exploit members ’ psychological vulnerability			1
‘ they see our qualities of passion and heart as attractive , ’ said the 22 - year - old gang member , @entity24			1
‘ many of the boys come from war - torn communities and have witnessed real pain and suffering and consequently have no fear			1
at the same time some , like me , will eventually question what they have done , what they are doing with their lives , the hopelessness of it all			2
when a brother is down i can see it in his eyes			2
‘ while most do not follow a radical agenda they are still susceptible to the jihad preachers			2
i have heard about some @entity15 falling victim to these people and going off to fight in places such as @entity19			1
’ he said @entity0 was linked to the gang in a ‘ low - level way ’ adding : ‘ he was n’t a hardcore guy ; he was quiet and shy			1
i ’ve seen the other @entity0 wandering around @entity8 as if sleep - walking , but i do n’t think he was directly involved			1
but he was immersed in what was going on around him			2
you ca n’t escape it			2
‘ when i saw him talking on tv with blood on his hands i thought , “ you idiot , you fool			2
” it was like he was a robot who had been activated and another man ’s words were coming out of his mouth			0
’ @entity24 described how the two suspects grew up against a backdrop of violence , fear and ‘ hopelessness ’ and said the crossover between criminal gangs and @entity77 groups has increased in recent years			1
‘ it is easy for preachers to pick off boys			0
they offer them a way out of violence when they are at their weakest			0
many of us , though , like the warmth we get from @entity85 , the brotherly love			0
people might find that strange as i ’ve led a bad life			2
‘ but i did operate under certain rules			0
never hurt anyone who is innocent and do n’t involve children in what we do			0
’ notorious : a senior member of the @entity15 , @entity24 , has revealed how the @entity16 - dominated gang has been targeted by extremists growing up in nearby @entity98 , @entity24 joined the gang at the age of 16			1
‘ i never knew my father , but if i ’d had him in my life it is most likely that i would never have got involved with the @entity15 , ’ he said			1
instead , he became rapidly immersed in violence			0
‘ my thing was robbing drug dealers , ’ he said			2
‘ we ’d set up a deal to buy a kilo of skunk [ around £ 6,000 ]			0
we ’d do this two or three times			0
then the next time , once we ’d got trust , we ’d ask for five kilos – and this is when we ’d rob them at knifepoint			0
then we ’d sell it to the more senior members for between £ 3,000 and £ 5,000			1
‘ at first , the biggest change being in the @entity15 brought to my life was the girls			1
girls of 16 , 17 , 18 – who would n’t have looked at me before – were coming up to me saying they wanted to lose their virginity			0
it was because i was a @entity122 , a respected individual			0
some would go as far as hiding drugs and guns for you			0
’ by the time he was 19 , @entity24 was driving a 7 - series @entity128 and earning £ 4,000 cash a week			1
‘ then things began to change			0
i lost three friends who were stabbed and shot and it made me question what i was doing			0
i did n’t want it for my kid brother , i ’ve always kept him on a different path			0
he ’s in school and my sister is in college and they are fine			0
‘ my mum was n’t pleased when i became a @entity16 , she thinks it ’s rubbish			1
but at least she knows i ’m too strong - minded to get picked up by the extremists			1
