he also has scores of other convictions to his name for handling stolen goods , going equipped to burgle and fraud since he first appeared at @entity41 aged 14 in 1961 on the charge of larceny			1
he was then given a two - year probation order and ordered to pay 38p in costs			0
since then , his criminal record has become 10 pages long and has included sentences totalling more than 40 years from @entity58 to the @entity59 and including @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 and @entity65			0
many of his offences were committed when he was released early on licence from previous jail terms			2
but it was the @entity9 court case in august 1992 that @entity3 was most infamous for			2
ironically , he was found not guilty at the @entity71 of burgling the @entity65 offices of solicitors @entity74 , @entity75 and @entity76 in january 1992 where an aide memoire detailing mr @entity9 's affair with his former secretary @entity79 was stolen from a safe			0
impact : @entity3 stole notes revealing intimate details about @entity9 's relationship with his personal assistant @entity79 in 1992 @entity3 , who was at the time a @entity86 member , tried to sell the document to the @entity88 for £ 30,000 and during his trial said a @entity91 supporter gave it to him			1
he was convicted of handling stolen goods and sentenced to 30 months			0
the jury was told afterwards he then had 230 convictions for burglary			0
rumours about the contents of the stolen document spread and mr @entity9 was forced publicly to admit his affair with ms @entity101 - prompting the famous @entity104 headline on february 6 1992 : it 's @entity106			0
@entity3 , an unemployed painter and decorator formerly from @entity108 in @entity109 , showed no emotion at @entity111 as the judge described him as a career burglar with no remorse for his victims , many who on this occasion were elderly			2
described by police as ' cold and calculated with no conscience whatsoever ' , @entity3 also goaded his probation officers with a @entity123 card he sent to them just before his arrest for the latest offences in late 2011			1
the car depicted @entity127 as a convict and said : ' have a super @entity129 and remember : crime does pay , ask any mp or bent copper			0
' but an ' eagle - eyed ' policeman , pc @entity133 , brought @entity135 's latest crime spree to an end when he saw him in @entity137 in @entity20 carrying a holdall			0
he had been sent on patrol in plain clothes in december last year as the burglary rate in the @entity142 , @entity143 and @entity137 areas of the @entity19 soared as @entity3 plied his trade			2
when asked what was in the holdall , the burglar , born in @entity147 , north @entity65 , replied : ' i 'd rather not say '			0
police found inside two crowbars , a gas - operated blow torch and a magnifying glass to examine the jewellery and silverware - often of great sentimental value - @entity3 liked to steal from homes in affluent areas when the owners were away			1
he was even living in one empty home in @entity137 so he did not have to travel or spend money on hotels			0
repeat offender : @entity3 goaded his probation officers with a @entity123 card he sent to them			2
it read ' have a super @entity129 and remember @entity165 does pay , ask any @entity131 or bent coppper ' the flat he owned outright in @entity108 was searched and property from three of the burglaries was found there			0
@entity3 had also stolen cash cards he used at @entity172 to draw cash dressed in clothes and hats to make him look much younger in an attempt to fool police			1
in mitigation , the court heard that @entity3 got ' a buzz ' from burglaries and he was obsessive about silverware and jewellery and he liked to value them			1
the court was also shown a letter to the court that said after seeing witness impact statements from his victims telling of the hurt he had caused he was now remorseful			0
but prosecution barrister @entity191 said that @entity3 had written exactly the same words when he was jailed for 40 months on the @entity193 in 2010 for a series of burglaries and ordered to pay back nearly £ 83,000 in a confiscation order that has forced him to sell his flat			1
jailing him , judge @entity198 mentioned the fear of his victims , including one recently widowed woman who had only just moved back to @entity201 when @entity3 stole jewellery of great sentimental value to her worth thousands of pounds			2
speaking outside the court , detective constable @entity204 , who led the investigation , said : ' @entity3 is a man who is a cold and calculated burglar who has no conscience whatsoever			2
' for years he has inflicted anguish and hurt by invading the homes of his countless victims and stealing from them valuables that were often of great sentimental value			0
' in these latest evil offences the victims were mostly elderly and were left in fear of living in their own homes after they had been ransacked by @entity3			1
' @entity3 was also given a two - year concurrent sentence for going equipped and a further one year each , again concurrently , for the two fraud offences .			2
