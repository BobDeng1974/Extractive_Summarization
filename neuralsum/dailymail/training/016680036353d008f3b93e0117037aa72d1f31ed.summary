@entity0 died aged 15 of encephalitis , a disease which causes swelling of the brain the parents of a schoolgirl who died after a catalogue of errors at a failing hospital told how they were forced to endure ‘ five years of torture ’ as they battled to find out the truth behind the tragedy			1
@entity0 , 15 , died of a brain injury just days after she was admitted to hospital with agonising headaches			1
doctors failed to carry out basic neurological checks which might have saved her life			2
but nobody from the hospital would even meet the family – even though the mother worked at the hospital – to discuss their concerns for more than a year			2
they then had to fight for four more years to get an inquest			2
yesterday , that inquest jury found medics at @entity29 in @entity30 missed a string of opportunities to save @entity0 ’s life in 2008			1
in a damning narrative verdict , they said staff had failed to take even the most basic steps – such as checking whether she could open her eyes , or examining the size of her pupils – which might have alerted them to her injury			2
doctors also administered the wrong treatments – which may have made her condition worse			0
after the inquest , @entity0 ’s stepfather @entity45 said the past five years had been torture			1
he said the hospital – which is under special measures and is one of 14 singled out for having high death rates – had ‘ evaded ’ responsibility for her death and had failed to respond to 81 allegations of negligence they had lodged			0
mr @entity45 , a pharmacy technician , said : ‘ from the moment @entity0 died we faced constant evasion and were passed from one person to another			1
this has tortured us for the last five years			2
’ @entity0 's step - father @entity45 says his other children have struggled to cope and wo n't go to the doctor @entity0 's step - dad @entity45 has said that he would never take another of his children to the hospital and would advise other parents to consider all their options first he added : ' they knew what had gone wrong from day one and they did n't implement changes because it was not in their interests			1
' you have incompetent staff and management that , i believe , are more focused on collecting a pay cheque than caring for people and that is a recipe for disaster			1
' i 'm not saying that everyone in the hospital is a rouge but it is the system that fails			0
the culture , the intimidation , and the lack of value for life			0
' despite being singled out for its abnormally high death rates , @entity29 ’s procedures ‘ had not changed ’ , mr @entity45 said			1
‘ for us there ’s no doubt that systematic failings caused @entity0 ’s death , ’ he added			1
‘ our daughter has been treated as collateral damage			0
i ask myself every day whether , if i had taken her to another hospital , she would still be alive			0
’ speaking about the continued problems at the hospital , mr @entity45 said : ' there is no way i would take any of my other children there			2
' they do n't want to go to the doctor anymore			1
we now dread taking them to any hospital let alone @entity118			0
' it is not for me to tell other people what to do with their children if they are sick but going to a hospital with such high profile problems , i would think twice and consider other options			2
' @entity0 was admitted to @entity29 in @entity30 after suffering headaches , vomiting and fitting his wife @entity127 , @entity0 ’s mother , added : ‘ it took until 2009 for the hospital to arrange a meeting and the doctors were very vague			1
we were just passed backwards and forwards			0
’ @entity0 , a promising pupil who had dreamed of becoming a paediatrician , had had severe headaches for seven days and had started vomiting and having fits			1
she was taken to @entity118 ’s @entity139 department on november 16 , 2008			1
dr @entity140 told the inquest he did not carry out basic tests on november 17 , because a colleague told him @entity0 ’s condition had improved			1
' a number of changes have since been introduced in the treatment of children and adults with neurological illness , including the introduction of more regular observations			2
' she died on november 19 of encephalitis , which causes swelling of the brain and is normally triggered by infection			1
the doctor said : ‘ with hindsight the neurological observations should have been done			2
but the handover to me was that the patient was waking up and was getting better			0
’ the inquest at @entity165 ’ @entity166 found a string of other errors			0
staff misinterpreted the results of a ct scan and failed to carry out a @entity173 scan , despite one being recommended			2
in addition , a lumbar puncture , in which fluid is taken from the spine , may have exacerbated her condition			0
@entity0 was also given @entity179 , a sedative only meant for adults , which could have masked warning signs of brain damage			1
it is the drug linked to the death of pop star @entity186			0
@entity0 ’s mother works as a pharmaceutical technician at @entity29 , and her husband admitted ‘ it has been hard for her to work there ’			1
@entity0 was kept on an adult ward at the hospital because of a shortage of beds at @entity198 's paediatric intensive care units she paid tribute to her daughter , a pupil at @entity201 in @entity202 , saying : ‘ she would be 20 if she were still alive			1
she wanted to be a paediatrician and we are sure she would be at university now			0
we miss her every day			0
’ the family said they would pursue regulatory , disciplinary and criminal action against the hospital			0
mr @entity45 said the tragedy had been hard on his other children as some of them had become introverted while others cried constantly			2
despite this hardship he said the family would now work with solicitors to pursue regulatory , disciplinary and criminal action against the hospital			0
' to stop here is just not fair to @entity0 and not just to any of her family ' he said			1
' our legal claim is going to hopefully highlight the failures and those responsible for taking our daughter from us			0
' @entity225 of @entity226 , who was the family 's legal representative , said : ' whilst we welcome today 's conclusions by the jury and the specific criticisms made - we remain concerned			1
' the length of time taken to establish and document a plan to prevent a re-occurrence of this type of incident was unacceptable in our view			0
' @entity118 and @entity238 apologised for the blunders			0
a spokesman added : ‘ a number of changes have since been introduced in the treatment of neurological illness			0
’ the jury returned a narrative verdict .			0

@entity0 was admitted to @entity29 in @entity30 after she *'d* been vomiting and fitting
she was admitted to an adult ward because there were no beds in the children 's ward
one doctor said he ' did n't worry too much ' about the checks because @entity0 was ' getting better '
@entity0 died in november 2008 , but it has taken *experts* five years to find out how she died
step - father *blames* systematic failings in both staff and management
