by @entity0 for @entity1 @entity3 's self - driving cars will be designed to exceed maximum speed limits , in a move to improve safety			1
the lead engineer for the project has revealed the vehicles will go 10mph ( 16km ) faster than the speed limit			1
the purpose is to avoid the @entity3 car being significantly slower than speeding vehicles around it , which would increase the risk of an accident			2
@entity18 - based @entity3 's driverless cars , unveiled in june ( shown ) , will be able to speed on roads			1
this was revealed by lead software engineer @entity21 in a test drive			1
the cars will be capable of going 10 mph ( 16 km / h ) above the speed limit , which will allow them to match the speed of other cars for safer driving in the @entity30 driverless cars are only allowed on roads in certain states if someone sits in the driver 's seat			1
the @entity36 is expected to start granting licences to certain driverless cars and their human co-pilots as soon as september			1
changes to the @entity42 @entity41 , which dates back to 1968 , are also afoot			0
it used to state : ' every driver shall at all times be able to control his vehicle or to guide his animals			0
' an amendment agreed in may would allow a car to drive itself , as long as the system ' can be overridden or switched off by the driver '			0
a driver must be present and able to take the wheel at any time			0
the convention covers @entity58 countries , @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 and @entity62 , although not the @entity30 , @entity63 or @entity64			0
@entity21 , the lead software engineer for the project , said research showed that sticking to the speed limit when other cars are speeding can be dangerous			1
therefore , the car ’s speed would be altered depending on traffic conditions , @entity70 reports			0
the same radar and camera system used for collision avoidance would be used to monitor the speed of other cars and match to them accordingly			2
there will be a limit , however , and if another car is dramatically speeding then @entity3 's driverless car will go no faster			1
but mr @entity21 did not elaborate on how the feature would work with speed cameras or mobile police , and whether it could incur a speeding fine			1
@entity3 hopes the autonomous cars will drastically reduce accidents on the roads			2
' thousands and thousands of people are killed in car accidents every year , ' said mr @entity21			0
' this [ the car ] could change that			0
' in june , it was announced that driverless cars would be allowed on @entity100 roads in six months			1
the @entity100 government will allow the first trials of computer - controlled cars to start in january 2015 , as part of a move to update the law to allow driverless cars			1
ministers have previously admitted that the current @entity109 and rules of the road are inadequate for the new generation of vehicles ( press image shown ) the government will allow the first trials of computer - controlled cars to start in january 2015 , as part of a move to update the law to allow driverless cars on @entity100 roads			1
ministers have previously admitted that the current @entity109 and rules of the road are inadequate for the new generation of vehicles which pilot themselves			0
the vehicles work by using gps technology to locate the vehicle ’s position on an electronic map			0
in june , @entity3 unveiled its computerised ‘ hands - free ’ self - driving bubble car , which has no steering wheel , brake or accelerator pedals			2
instead , it has buttons for start , pull over and emergency stop and a computer screen showing the planned route			0
@entity3 says the goal is for the car to ‘ shoulder the entire burden of driving ’			2
the prototype two - seater cars have buttons to autonomously begin and end the drive			2
the car makes turns and react to other vehicles and pedestrians based on computer programs that predict what others might do , and data from sensors including radar and cameras that read in real time what other objects are actually doing			0
the route might be set by typing a destination into a map or using spoken commands according to @entity160 , the leader of @entity3 's self - driving car team			1
the car will be powered by electricity and could go about 100 miles ( 160 km ) before charging			0
its shape suggests a rounded - out @entity166 - something that might move people around a corporate campus or congested downtown - with headlights and sensors arrayed to resemble a friendly face			0
the front of the vehicle has a soft foam - like material where a traditional bumper would be and a more flexible windscreen , in a bid to be safer for pedestrians			0
in these prototypes speed is restricted to 25mph ( 40 km / h ) and the ability to self - drive will depend on specifically designed @entity3 road maps tested on the company ’s current fleet of vehicles			1
ultimately the vehicles will be faster and will be able to use @entity3 's extended maps service			1
driving works by using gps technology to locate the vehicle ’s exact position on an electronic map			0
a combination of radar , lasers and cameras sitting on top of the roof give the car a 360 - degree ‘ view ’ , with sensors linked to computer software able to ‘ see ’ and identify people , cars , road signs and markings and traffic lights .			2
