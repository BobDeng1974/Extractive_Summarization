@entity1 boss @entity0 has been getting some social media stick for his decision to watch @entity6 's @entity5 clash with @entity7 at @entity8			1
the only @entity10 player to start the game was @entity12 , who retired from international duty in september 2012 after being cleared of racially abusing then - @entity15 defender @entity14 during a match			1
so who was @entity0 keeping tabs on at @entity19 ? @entity0 beams before kick - off at @entity8 alongside his @entity1 assistant @entity21 @entity12 makes it 3 - 0 for @entity6 after running the length of the pitch to add the finishing touch to a counter @entity1 's next @entity28 qualification match is on november 15 against @entity29 , where @entity6 's opponents on tuesday , @entity7 , hail from			1
they were unbeaten in eight @entity5 games this season before they ventured to west @entity35 , and three of their starting @entity38 on tuesday were included in the @entity29 squad for qualification matches against @entity41 and @entity42 earlier this month			0
@entity43 the left - back was at fault for the first goal as @entity47 cut in from the right - hand side , pushed the ball on to his left foot and then curled a shot into the far corner			2
@entity43 was then unfortunate enough to turn @entity54 's shot into his own net to make it 4 - 0 shortly after the break			0
subbed off in the 56th minute			0
@entity6 's imposing defender @entity58 towers above @entity7 's @entity29 international @entity43 the left - back gets his legs tangled as @entity54 's effort flicks off his heel and ricochets in to make it 4 - 0 @entity64 and @entity65 @entity7 's central - midfield pair were always going to struggle against the likes of @entity68 and @entity69 , two of the most in - form midfielders in not just @entity1 but also @entity72			1
@entity6 dominated the centre of the pitch as @entity64 and @entity65 failed to cope with their pace and power			2
the visitors also created very little going forward as their midfield repeatedly gave the ball away cheaply			0
so , all in all , not much to worry about for @entity0			2
@entity64 , right , struggles to get near @entity47 , who opened the scoring for @entity6 with a curling shot @entity82 flicks the ball past @entity7 central midfielder @entity65 , who struggled throughout at @entity19			0

@entity0 was in *attendance* at @entity8 with @entity21
*regular* @entity1 centre - back @entity87 was named on the bench
this meant the only @entity10 player that started was @entity12 , who retired from international duty in september 2012 after being cleared of racism
@entity1 *youth* international @entity96 made his debut for @entity6 as a second - half substitute
