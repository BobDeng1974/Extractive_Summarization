he spent 15 years on death row before his sentence was commuted to life imprisonment in 2002			1
lawyers for @entity9 have contended for years that @entity23 drug cartels were responsible for the deaths , and tuesday ’s a defense motion filed in state court represented the first time they were specific in their allegations			2
former @entity11 millionaire @entity9 and his wife @entity30 ( right ) in a prison in @entity32 , @entity33 @entity34 ( left ) , attorney for @entity9 and @entity9 's wife , @entity35 , are hoping to overturn his conviction the judge will consider the motion at the hearing and whether the files , believed to be held by @entity6 federal agencies , should be released			1
the filing sets out testimony provided by several other former members of @entity23 drug cartels , who have admitted that mr @entity9 was not involved in the murder			0
instead , the cartel members say the @entity47 were murdered on the orders of drug baron @entity49			0

@entity34 , mr @entity9 's counsel for more than 20 years and director of legal charity @entity95 , said : ' this is a test for the @entity33 prosecutors - are they interested in exonerating @entity98 , an innocent man in a wheelchair , or do they want to defend @entity49 for two of the many homicides that he ordered			1
' it is also a test for the @entity106 - will they assist a @entity11 citizen to get the evidence he needs , or merely make statements about the need for fair trials ? ' during the hearing nearly six years ago , the family of the murder victims pleaded tearfully with the state clemency board to deny @entity9 's request			1
@entity6 prosecutors told the board that @entity9 had a fair trial and a series of appeal hearings and other investigations that have all come to the same conclusion			0
