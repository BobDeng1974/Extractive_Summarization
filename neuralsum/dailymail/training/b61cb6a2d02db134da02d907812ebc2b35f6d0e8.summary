the @entity1 @entity0 is large , sprawling and , in places , a little down at heel			0
the football pitches are well tended and the hotel is in reasonable condition			0
but there is a sense of fading grandeur at @entity10 , partly enhanced by the dripping , dank atmosphere of the @entity13 winter			0
all around the vast training complex there is poverty , decay , people without work sitting on their doorsteps drinking from litre bottles of beer and the only things for sale are tractors , new tyres , fresh oil and a revamped exhaust if you want it			2
shock : the world champions are out of the @entity33 after two consecutive defeats wo n't need these again : @entity35 throws his gloves to fans after a poor display at the @entity39 @entity40 bowed : @entity41 got major decisions wrong throughout a dismal campaign for @entity44 you can easily imagine that , when they were first opened , these grounds where @entity44 have been living and training must have been a shiny , glittering monument to football			1
these days , they ’ve been overtaken by the kind of first - class facilities encountered at the majority of top @entity56 football clubs			0
all in all , @entity44 ’s chosen home here in @entity58 has been a decent metaphor for their @entity33 performance : down at heel , lacking in warmth , no longer cutting edge			1
and there are other things , beyond the football , which separate @entity44 ’s campaign in @entity58 from the victories in @entity69 in 2008 , @entity70 in 2010 and @entity72 - @entity71 two years ago			1
there have been a myriad of small fissures which have combined to make a genuine @entity76 right down the middle of the world champions ’ brand of play			0
this is the first major tournament since @entity44 started winning where the players ’ daily life is not complemented with time off to spend with wives , girlfriends , kids , grandparents			1
@entity58 is an odd place			1
the army is everywhere ; patrolling the streets , guarding the training ground , swarming all over every stadium			0
between crime and social protest , @entity44 ’s players have been stripped of the natural outlet of wandering around their local area			1
this is also the first tournament since the breakthrough where @entity44 have done no double sessions			2
treated as a way to hone fitness and match sharpness , plus a specific attack on the kind of boredom and loneliness which can suck the vitality out of any squad , i think it has been an error to decide that — because the players are brutally tired after six or seven years of constant top - level challenges and success — this was the time to drop the second sessions			0
then there ’s the climate			0
winter in @entity13 is no worse than an inhospitable @entity122 autumn , but the weather has been grey , damp and grisly cold			0
horror : @entity35 has been a walking mistake this tournament and was consoled by @entity127 against @entity128 awful : @entity58 - born @entity129 has been a huge disappointment for @entity44 in the first two games for @entity133 , it has been a bane			1
more so when the first game in @entity135 was preceded by a hot , humid training day and the build - up weather in @entity138 was in the mid 80s			0
neither match was difficult in terms of the heat or humidity but both environments were a huge change from the chill of the south			2
but back in 2008 the mud and the rain of @entity150 , where @entity44 trained , were a much more stark contrast with the sweltering heat of the three knockout matches in @entity154 en route to the title			1
temperatures at night in @entity157 often hit zero or less and @entity44 coped			2
what has changed ? appetite ? youth ? squad harmony ? something i can tell you as a first - hand witness is that what @entity41 said on friday — that there has been no correlation between how the world champions train and how they play — is @entity170 ’ve been permitted to watch all but two of the training sessions here and @entity44 have moved the ball with dazzling speed and confidence			1
the work was serious , the players @entity178 could hear the voices of @entity127 , @entity180 and @entity41 urging more from those involved			2
trouble : @entity183 looked more threatening than @entity129 despite struggling for form in recent years is that a captain 's stance ? @entity35 looked bemused in the tunnel before going out for the second half out on their feet : the @entity133 team looked tired in the second half , and were outrun against @entity128 what you all watched on television — stumbling , imprecise , languid , unrecognisable shadows — did not resemble the guys we had watched			1
something which now seems completely clear is that this group has been knocked dizzy by three firm blows to the chin			0
firstly , @entity44 have moved in the food chain from predators to prey			2
for years teams were petrified of them			2
teams parked the bus because they knew that hitting @entity44 on the counter was probably the least risky way of doing them damage			1
gradually , @entity213 in the qualifying group , @entity215 in the @entity216 semi-final and @entity58 in the subsequent final have shown that , if you go after @entity44 , then athleticism , height and power can leave the world champions vulnerable			1
secondly — the fact that @entity225 , at 34 , is a declining force has been of cataclysmic importance			2
as for those who say it was wrong of @entity41 to bring him , there was little of that talk when he produced the brilliant pass from which @entity129 won the penalty in the opening match			1
it ’s also worth pointing out that when @entity225 was dropped for the @entity128 match , @entity44 ’s midfield , if anything , deteriorated			1
glum : @entity225 ( centre ) could only watch on as his @entity44 side were utterly humiliated at the @entity39 they ca n't believe it ! @entity133 supporters watched on distraught as they were taught a footballing lesson what has unarguably gone is @entity225 ’s ability to control the ebb and flow of an entire match with his elegant pass - move - pass - move			1
with decline , @entity44 ’s confidence that they can dominate possession in an attacking , front - foot manner has gradually drained away			1
his play , his leadership has defined this era			0
i see team - mates no longer sure that they can shunt the ball to @entity225 and something safe , intelligent and probably dangerous to the opponent will be done			1
for @entity44 to cope with the change in other teams ’ attitude to them plus @entity225 ’s inevitable lessening of influence has been too much			1
thirdly , the lack of goals is a fatal flaw			0
every team needs a pressure release and i ’ll leave here bamboozled as to why @entity41 thought that he saw goals in @entity129			1
the @entity58 got here fit — but out of form			1
that never changed in training or in the match			0
his role should have been that of impact sub			0
missing : @entity287 ( right ) failed to play against @entity288 or @entity128 despite being in better form than @entity129 new blood : @entity292 midfielder @entity291 ( right ) will be a major part of the new - look @entity44 @entity287 , on the other hand , scored twice in the last friendly and regularly in training			1
but got no minutes in the first two games			0
@entity297 pointed out that @entity44 made ‘ too many errors ’			2
he could have had his captain , @entity35 , in mind			0
this tournament asked him to stretch his resources just too far			0
by the end of the @entity304 in @entity305 he was spent			0
but those who insist that this is the end for a philosophy of football are wrong			0
it is an undignified end for some all - time great players but , above all , @entity44 arrived here two weeks behind their opposition in terms of match sharpness			1
@entity317 , @entity318 , @entity127 , @entity319 , @entity291 , @entity320 , @entity321 , @entity322 and @entity323 will stay			0
@entity324 , @entity325 , @entity326 , @entity327 , @entity328 and @entity329 , all of whom have won @entity56 under - 21 titles , will join them			0
@entity333 will take place and @entity44 winning @entity335 is a decent bet			2
right now , that ’s little consolation for a desolate @entity33			2

@entity44 were eliminated from the @entity33 after losing to @entity288 and @entity128
@entity41 's side were not as sharp as their opponents
@entity225 's decline was key to their poor performances in @entity58
@entity129 was fit but out of form after a difficult end to last season
teams are no longer *afraid* of facing @entity44 and press them high up the pitch instead of sitting back
