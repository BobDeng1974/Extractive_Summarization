by @entity1 - @entity0 follow @ @ riathalsam @entity2 has told @entity3 it ’s about time he delivered at a @entity5 — but has backed the striker to go on and break sir @entity9 ’s long - standing @entity8 goals record			1
on the grandest stage , @entity3 is yet to score			0
he was an injured imitation of himself at the 2006 competition , which ended with a red card against @entity15 in the quarter - finals			0
in 2010 he criticised his own supporters on camera after the dourest of draws against @entity21			0
‘ he probably has n’t yet gone to a @entity5 in the best of fitness and you ca n’t argue with his record at international level overall , ’ @entity2 said			1
‘ but he needs to have a big tournament with @entity8 and , if he does that , he will be the key to us having a successful @entity5			1
listen , i ’m a fan of @entity3			0
i think he ticks all the boxes as a player			0
hot shot : @entity2 , pictured scoring at @entity5 ' 98 , believes @entity3 will break @entity8 's goal scoring record ' but for him to be put in the same bracket as @entity43 or @entity44 , he needs to have a great tournament in @entity46			1
' although having said that , @entity43 has yet to set the place on fire at a @entity5 too			2
’ @entity2 will be a @entity49 pundit during the @entity5 in @entity46 .			2

@entity2 backs @entity3 to break @entity9 's @entity8 scoring record
former @entity8 striker *insists* @entity3 must deliver at a @entity5 before being considered *alongside* @entity44 and @entity43
the @entity55 failed to score at the 2006 and 2010 @entity56
