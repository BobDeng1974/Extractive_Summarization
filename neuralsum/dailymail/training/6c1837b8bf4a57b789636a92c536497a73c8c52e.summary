by @entity0 a newborn twin boy died because managers at an overstretched maternity unit failed to make proper checks on whether a bungling doctor was up to the job			0
dr @entity7 was allowed to work only under the supervision of a consultant after being blamed for the death of a young mother following childbirth , and also after falsifying medical records			1
but with a severe shortage of staff , managers at the unit where he had been working as a locum for three days allowed him to take charge of delivering @entity22 ’s twin boys			1
moments before the end : @entity24 in the arms of his parents			0
he was deprived of oxygen at birth after his head got stuck for 20 minutes , causing severe brain damage			1
he died after three weeks on a life support machine the first , @entity32 , was born safely , but his brother , @entity24 , was deprived of oxygen when his head got stuck for 20 minutes , and suffered severe brain damage			1
yet dr @entity35 still placed him on his mother ’s chest – only for her to see to her horror that he had turned grey and was n’t breathing			1
@entity24 died after three weeks on a life support machine			1
after a lengthy battle to learn the truth , mrs @entity22 and her husband @entity44 , from @entity45 , @entity46 , have now been awarded more than £ 50,000 after the hospital accepted @entity24 would probably have survived had he been delivered competently			2
dr @entity35 , 49 , who was found to have ‘ communication problems ’ because @entity48 is not his first language , was later banned from practising for lying to investigators			1
but the @entity51 are furious that none of the staff who put him in charge of such a complicated birth have been disciplined			0
‘ you put your trust in these people and believe that they know best , ’ said mrs @entity22 , 27			0
‘ now we know managers at the hospital knew he was n’t competent enough to deliver my twins but simply left him to it			0
‘ we feel the people who let him work that night are partly responsible for what happened			0
’ the lost twin : @entity24 , right , with @entity32 , now three			2
dr @entity35 , who was found to have ' communication problems ' because @entity48 is not his first language and was later banned from practising for lying to investigators in 2007 the @entity75 - born doctor , who specialises in obstetrics and gynaecology , was branded negligent by a high court judge after sending home a new mother who complained of headaches with painkillers when she in fact had a fatal blood clot			1
then in 2008 he was accused of falsifying medical records and prescribing powerful drugs to a pregnant patient he had not seen while working as a locum in @entity89			0
the @entity90 ordered that he should work only under the supervision of a consultant			2
in september 2010 he secured a locum post at @entity94			0
on the night @entity24 was born there were staff shortages and clinical director @entity97 let dr @entity35 work unsupervised because the alternative was shutting the maternity unit			1
dr @entity35 : he was allowed to work only under the supervision of a consultant after being blamed for the death of a young mother @entity32 was delivered safely but @entity24 was deprived of oxygen when he became stuck			1
three weeks later his parents were advised to turn off his life support machine			2
in an initial report , the hospital claimed @entity24 ’s death had been unavoidable , saying ‘ no gaps in care were identified ’			0
but after his angry parents discovered that dr @entity35 should not have been practising unsupervised , @entity24 ’s inquest was halted			1
an independent medical expert concluded that ‘ the outcome could have been significantly better ’ had he been supervised by an experienced consultant , but the coroner recorded a verdict of accidental death			0
dr @entity35 was initially allowed to continue practising but after pressure from @entity24 ’s parents there was a fresh investigation			1
the @entity123 banned him from practising for 12 months for lying that he had told the @entity90 about his @entity125 locum post			0
he has now lost an appeal			0
mr @entity127 , a 36 - year - old plasterer , said : ‘ his mistakes have now caused the deaths of a mother and a baby , but he could be able to work again next year – what does it take for a doctor to be struck off ? ’ @entity94 described @entity24 ’s death as a ‘ very sad incident ’ and said ‘ changes in practice have been put in place ’			2
but it added : ‘ @entity142 has found no grounds for action against individual doctors			0
’ dr @entity35 ’s solicitors declined to comment .			2

@entity7 was *previously* blamed for death of mother after childbirth
he was only meant to work under supervision of a consultant
staff shortage meant he took charge of delivering @entity22 *'s* twins
@entity32 was born safely but @entity24 was deprived of oxygen and suffered brain damage and died after three weeks on life support
dr @entity35 initially continued practising but has now been banned for one year
