the 33 - year - old has finally got a full head of locks , pictured left , after undergoing cosmetic treatment			1
she said : ' it feels really strange having long hair because for so many years i only had patches of hair or nothing at all			1
mrs @entity6 had to pay the Â£ 800 for the treatment herself because it is deemed a ' cosmetic procedure			1
' ' it was really strange because i 'd wake up with bald patches on my head - i did n't have a clue what had happened , ' she said			1
' i visited doctors on a regular basis and i started seeing psychiatrists when i was around 11 - years - old but they did n't seem to know what the problem was			1
' i found myself wanting to pull my hair out and i could n't stop myself - it gradually got worse and worse as i got older			2
' it seems really strange but it 's not much different from people biting their nails or anything like that			0
' it was really difficult for me because people would stare and make jokes about me having no hair - it was very upsetting			2
before : mrs @entity6 said she could not stop herself pulling her hair out and it got worse the older she got ' i suffered a lot of abuse as well which was so hard to take - people said i would pull my hair out just to get attention which was really cruel			1
' i also lost my father when i was 14 - years - old so i had a pretty traumatic childhood which did n't help			2
' to be given a full head of hair for the first time after almost 30 years of having the condition is a huge relief			1
' even though i 'm still getting used to it , i feel much more confident since i had the therapy			0
' it is not known what causes @entity8 but it usually starts in teenagers , more often girls , at the age of 11 to 13			2
