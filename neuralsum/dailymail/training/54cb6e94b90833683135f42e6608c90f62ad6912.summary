when it comes to delinquent behaviour , it does n't matter how emotionally mature a woman is when it comes to breaking the rules			1
a study has found that the majority of young women will display some form of antisocial behaviour during puberty , regardless of whether they have high or low levels of emotional intelligence			1
while young men only carry out delinquent acts when they have a low level of emotional maturity			1
@entity20 psychologists have studied emotional intelligence ( @entity22 ) this is a level of how in - tune people are with their , and other 's emotions			1
they found men with a low level of @entity22 were more likely to be delinquent			1
but they found the opposite effect was true for women ( stock image shown ) in particular , the results revealed that men with a low level of emotional intelligence were more likely to turn to violence and aggression than men with a high level			1
but for young women , those with both high and low levels of emotional intelligence were just as likely to be antisocial or delinquent as each other			1
the study , by psychologists at @entity20 , found that during puberty and into their early twenties , there was a correlation between a person wanting attention and antisocial behaviour			2
emotional intelligence ( @entity22 ) is the ability by a person to express and control their own emotions			1
it is also the ability to understand and respond to the emotions of others			0
those with a high @entity22 are able to emphasise more with other people and have a greater emotional maturity			1
those with a lower @entity22 are not always conscious about what others may be feeling and also find it more difficult to control their own emotions			0
previous thinking suggested that those with a high level of emotional intelligence ( @entity22 ) - or maturity - would have a greater ability to control their behaviour			1
but despite young men showing an ability to regulate their sensation seeking and delinquent behaviours , for females this made no difference			0
those with a high level of @entity22 actually showed a higher tendency for antisocial behaviour , researchers said			2
during the study around 100 young people were asked if , while between the ages of 12 and 25 , they had engaged in forms of anti-social behaviour			0
the options ranged from truancy , rowdy behaviour in public , smoking cannabis and using public transport without a ticket , to other forms of delinquency such as drink driving , arson and physical violence			0
for young women , those with both high and low levels of emotional intelligence were just as likely to be antisocial or delinquent as each other ( stock image of @entity105 shown ) they were also given detailed questionnaires to gauge their sensation seeking and track @entity22 levels			1
the results showed young men with low ei and high levels of sensation seeking were more likely to carry out delinquency - but high @entity22 tended to have a balanced effect and lower delinquency			1
previous studies suggest men are more inclined to carry out violence and aggression - acts which do not necessarily require them to understand their victim 's thoughts and emotions			2
for young women , however , those showing high levels of both factors were more inclined towards delinquency			0
researchers believe they tended to veer more towards bullying , both of a social and emotional nature			0
during the study around 100 young people were asked if , while between the ages of 12 and 25 , they had engaged in forms of anti-social behaviour			0
the options ranged from truancy and rowdy behaviour to more serious forms of delinquency such as drink driving , arson and physical violence ( stock image shown ) dr @entity146 , a lecturer in psychology , who led the study , said : ' levels of sensation seeking , where you actively seek out novel experiences , peak in adolescence , and there is a well - documented association of them with delinquency and other risk - taking behaviours			0
' in general , high trait @entity22 individuals are able to form positive and effective personal relationships and are able to regulate their emotions and behaviours in ways that support personal well - being			0
' we predicted the relationship between sensation seeking and delinquent behaviour would be affected by @entity22 , but to discover it seemingly only lessened delinquency in young men - and not young women - was a surprising and unprecedented result			2
' the study aimed to further investigate well - documented associations between sensation seeking and delinquency			0
but , in a first for research of its nature , they also factored in an individual 's emotional intelligence , showing whether traits commonly seen as positive influences on well - being , such as empathy and self - regulation , impacted on a person 's adolescent behaviour			2
' by showing that high @entity22 is a positive thing for young men , we can see that promoting it in schools and other social arenas could have positive outcomes , ' dr @entity193 added			2
' for young women , we need to further explore why traits which should lead to high levels of self - esteem and self - regulation might predispose them to antisocial relational behaviours			0
' in turn , we hope to discover how we might help them find ways to channel their behaviour in a positive way			0

@entity20 psychologists studied emotional intelligence ( @entity22 )
this is a level of how in - tune people are with their , and other 's emotions
men with a low level of @entity22 were more likely to be delinquent
but they found the effect did not hold true for women
those that were more emotionally mature were just as likely to be antisocial as those with a low level
goes against previous theories that a high @entity22 means people behave better
