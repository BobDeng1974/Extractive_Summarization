by @entity0 published : 06:35 est , 7 november 2013 updated : 06:37 est , 7 november 2013 an incredible hi - tech tabletop enables individuals to reproduce virtual versions of their own hands and small objects			2
the @entity7 table allows a person to wave their hands or move an object under some camera sensors so that their movements are replicated by small moveable bars placed in a grid formation that make up the tabletop			1
the invention , by a team of @entity18 scientists , might remind some people of a hi - tech version of a pin art toy they played with as children			0
here , a demonstrator cups a red ball the @entity7 ' state - of - the - art shape display , ' which was created by professor @entity36 and his students at the @entity38 at the @entity39 and impressively , it works in realtime			1
the ' tangible interface system ' uses camera sensors from @entity44 's @entity43 to read objects in three dimensions			0
the @entity7 ' state - of - the - art shape display ' was created by professor @entity36 and his students at the @entity49 , a circular basket is placed under the sensors and is replicated on the table this image shows the replication of the basket			1
the bars , which can move independently from one another , can also be lit and a red patch indicates where the ball in the ' real ' basket under the sensors , is positioned this information is then processed by a computer , to move the small bars placed in a grid pattern within the tabletop , which results very quickly in the replication of a person 's hands or an object like a basket			1
the researchers said the tabletop ' provides for variable stiffness rendering and realtime user input through direct touch and tangible interaction			0
' in a video , demonstrating the innovation , the researchers use a ball to show how the table has the power to move an object around on its surface , using the dynamic bars			0
the creators of @entity7 ( pictured ) envision their innovation could be used to replicate objects remotely and even reproduce city maps , using 3d data			1
here , a researcher show how he can move a ball on the table using his hands , which are read by nearby sensors the invention might remind people of a high - tech version of the popular ' pin art ' toy the scientists wrote in a research paper : ' we show how shape change can be utilised to manipulate passive objects			2
mechanical forces can push objects , causing them to roll , slide , or tumble in one direction or another			0
other constraints can be programmed to rotate or raise passive objects			0
' the creators of @entity7 envision their innovation could be used to replicate objects remotely and even reproduce city maps , using 3d data , which could mean you could one day take a 3d tour around a miniature , stylised city without leaving your desk , @entity111 reported			1
the researchers also note that as their shape display allows for more general purpose shape change than any competing shapechanging interfaces , it makes an ' ideal research platform ' for scientists and engineers			2
professor @entity36 leads @entity129 at the university , which explores how to seamlessly connect the ' dual world of bits and atoms by giving physical form to digital information '			0
his team said : ' our belief is that shapechanging interfaces will become increasingly available in the future			0
' as well as replicating objects , mechanical forces that underpin the system of small bars , which make up the tabletop , can be used to push objects , causing them to roll , slide , or tumble in one direction or another , according to the scientists the machine is composed of sensors ( from @entity44 's @entity43 ) , a projector , the ' shape display ' bars in the table , pins and linkages , actuators ( pictured ) and a hefty computer			1

the @entity7 ' state - of - the - art shape display ' was created by professor @entity36 and his students at the @entity38
the innovation uses sensors to read a person 's hand movements and then replicated them using small moveable bars that make up the tabletop
scientists believe the futuristic surface could be used to replicate objects remotely and even reproduce cities in miniature
