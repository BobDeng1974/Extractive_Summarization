by @entity0 published : 20:37 est , 4 november 2013 updated : 04:16 est , 5 november 2013 we may be living in dumbed - down @entity2 , but it would appear that , on the whole , we ’re rather more cultured than some of our neighbours in @entity7			0
we attend more operas than the @entity9 and visit more art galleries than the @entity11 , according to a study			1
the report says @entity2 are ahead of our neighbours on nine key cultural measures – debunking @entity7 ’s view of us as a race addicted to reality tv and celebrity gossip			0
the report found @entity2 were more likely to visit art galleries than the @entity11 who claim to have the world 's best collections according to the @entity27 - based @entity26 survey of 27,000 people from across the @entity29 , we are far more likely to read a book , far more aware of history and far more keen to enjoy cultural events such as the ballet and the theatre than the average @entity29 citizen			1
the land that gave the world @entity38 has one of the largest theatre - going publics in @entity7 , with 39 per cent of @entity2 saying they had attended a play in the last 12 months – well above the @entity29 average of 28 per cent			1
almost two thirds – 65 per cent – of us have visited a historical monument or site over the last year			0
that compares with 54 per cent of @entity11 and 41 per cent of @entity9			1
@entity11 has long prided itself as nation with the best art galleries			1
but only 37 per cent of @entity11 said they had visited a museum or gallery in the past year , compared to 52 per cent of @entity2			2
you are more likely to find more empty auditorium seats in the home of opera , @entity9 , where only 17 per cent of natives said they had seen been to one in the last year compared to 22 per cent of @entity2			2
we are also more likely to visit our opera houses such as the @entity60 in @entity61 ( pictured ) than @entity9 , while 80 per cent of us read a book last year in austerity blighted @entity64 , visits to historical monuments have collapsed to under half the @entity29 average , with domestic visitor numbers at such iconic sites as the @entity70 and @entity71 in free - fall			1
the survey found 80 per cent of @entity2 had their noses in a book last year			2
that compares with the @entity29 average of 68 per cent – but only just beats the @entity78 on 79 per cent			0
with both countries on the verge of political and economic collapse , only half the populations in @entity64 and @entity80 have picked up a book over the last year			0
overall , the survey shows that @entity2 bucks the @entity7 - wide decline in arts and literature ‘ involvement ’ , which is down 24 per cent across the @entity29 over the last five years due to the @entity90 crisis			0
but the @entity2 has witnessed only a two per cent drop in the number attending or participating in cultural activities , the survey shows .			0
