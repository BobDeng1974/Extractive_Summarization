the today show stirred up its own controversy wednesday morning while discussing the fake sign language interpreter who managed to make it into the @entity6 memorial			1

at right , @entity32 appears flummoxed as he squints toward his monitor ' that 's horrific ' : just after the brief but offensive gag aired live , today co-host @entity35 called something ' horrific , ' though it was n't clear if she was referring to her show 's joke or the fraudulent interpreter the joke lasted for only a moment , but it was broadcast live and long enough for anyone to clearly see			1
