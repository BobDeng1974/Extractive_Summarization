@entity3 may be attracting offers from the likes of @entity6 to go to the @entity8 next season but he remains intent on taking his first steps into coaching			1
@entity8 franchises are continuing to look for star names to lift the game 's profile and the possibility of taking the same steps as @entity17 also appeals to @entity3			2
the 35 - year - old is ready to leave @entity19 at the end of the season but is considering retiring from playing and concentrate on getting his coaching badges			2
hanging up his boots ? @entity3 is intent on moving into coaching at the end of this season in and out : injury has disrupted @entity3 's season at @entity29 under new manager @entity30 he began his courses more than three years ago but had to stop when a back injury needed his full attention			2
he has picked up where he left off this season and intends to gain the first stage of his qualifications by the summer when he is also likely to begin tv work helping with coverage of the @entity40			0
@entity19 are scouring the market for replacements for @entity3			2
they have studied the much - touted @entity43 at @entity44 but have doubts he is really at the level they require , while have an admiration for @entity49 but suspect he has already agreed to join @entity50 - either this week or in the summer			1
not up to it : @entity43 ( left ) of @entity44 is not considered of the required quality by @entity19 tied up : united like the look of @entity54 's @entity49 ( left ) , but feel a deal is already in place with @entity50 weak link : @entity30 has also ruled out a bid for @entity59 because he does not think he 's good enough @entity59 at @entity60 has been mentioned but @entity30 is well schooled on @entity62 football and knows @entity63 sees the @entity64 as one of his weaker links , as underlined by @entity68 's attack in their @entity70 tie in @entity71			1
at 30 too , a deal does not represent great business for @entity30 , who is building a new era			0
@entity76 's @entity75 is a player @entity30 is happy to bid £ 20m - plus for but @entity19 have been told the 18 - year - old is not for sale at any price this window			1
four way battle : @entity19 are ready to contest the signing of @entity76 's @entity75 with @entity68 , @entity50 and @entity83 @entity84 is again favourite to sign the boyhood @entity50 fan , although @entity68 and @entity83 have asked to be kept informed			1
one @entity3 we could yet be seeing more of on these shores , however , is @entity89			2
the younger @entity3 brother is keen on a return to @entity92 as his move to @entity95 club @entity94 has turned sour with the 28 - year - old making just a handful of appearances since joining from @entity99			2
combative : @entity101 boss @entity100 is set to revive his interest in @entity104 's @entity103 admirer : @entity100 is also set to pursue a move for @entity104 striker @entity107 @entity101 to return for @entity104 's combative @entity108 ? @entity101 are ready to revive interest in @entity104 midfielder @entity103 and may look to take @entity107 too			1
the combative @entity103 spoke at the weekend about how much he was looking forward to appearing in the @entity111 final for @entity104 against @entity68 yet @entity112 has to take stock of how such a transfer can aid his team going forward and more pertinently survive in the @entity116			1
@entity103 , 25 , has made 19 appearances this season in all competitions and 14 last year			0
his disciplinary record has improved massively but @entity112 feels it is a deal he can afford to do if he can bring in @entity121 from @entity122 and ever banega on loan from @entity124			0
in turn , should @entity103 go through to @entity101 , @entity125 may revisit a deal for @entity101 's @entity128 recalled @entity129 from his loan at @entity131 today after interest from @entity101 in @entity107			1

. done : @entity134 's @entity133 should finallise his move to @entity99 in the coming days @entity136 are keen on @entity129 , too , and also want @entity104 's @entity137 and @entity138			1
@entity112 may yet decide to keep @entity129 himself for the relegation run - in			0
wednesday may turn to @entity141 's @entity140			0
@entity142 expected to complete @entity99 move shortly @entity133 should finalise his move from @entity134 to @entity99 in the next few days			1
the @entity147 @entity146 forward has been in discussions over a £ 2million move for the past few weeks			0
click here for @entity151 of @entity1 several @entity116 sides have shown an interest as have @entity156 side @entity154 but most wanted a deal in the summer			0
@entity158 could find himself a bargain and will look to team him with @entity160 of @entity161 who is due to have a medical on tuesday .			0
