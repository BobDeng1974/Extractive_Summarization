by @entity0 voters could have to go back to the ballot box for a second general election next year if @entity4 choose independence			1
that ’s because @entity4 mps could be removed from @entity8 within months of a @entity10 vote in the referendum			1
this could potentially trigger another election as the abolition of the 59 @entity4 seats could change the balance of power			1
senior @entity17 warn @entity18 could go down in history as the prime minister who lost the union if @entity23 wins a slim majority , experts have said it would leave @entity8 with a ‘ zombie government ’ , forced to limp on as a minority administration			1
this is because @entity29 ’s party is particularly reliant on @entity4 seats to bolster its power			1
it won 41 seats north of the border in 2010 , whereas the @entity35 have just one @entity4 seat			2
while elections are meant to be held only once every five years , a snap election can still be triggered if there is a vote of no confidence in a government			0
there are even calls from @entity17 to oust @entity4 mps before the 2015 election			1
this would deprive @entity4 of a vote in the general election , as well as removing all @entity4 seats			2
however , @entity18 knows this would project a negative message ahead of the september 18 referendum			2
some @entity17 even say mr @entity18 will have to resign if @entity4 votes for independence			1
one senior conservative said mr @entity18 would ‘ go down in history as the prime minister who lost the union ’ and would have no choice but to quit @entity58			1
protest : a pro-independence rally in @entity60			0
the no to independence campaign 's lead is thinning other @entity35 mps called for a law change to block @entity4 voters from taking part in the 2015 general election if they back independence later this year			1
votes in @entity4 will have their say on independence in a referendum on september 18			2
recent polls have suggested that support for going it alone is rising , with the no campaign ’s lead narrowing			2
in a major political headache , if @entity4 votes for independence it will not break away officially until 2016			2
it means that in theory voters north of the border will still be able to take part in the 2015 general election to choose mps for @entity8			2
senior @entity17 now want to ban all 59 constituencies north of the border from taking part in the general election			1
the move would make a dramatic difference to the outcome of the election next year , wiping out a significant section of @entity23 's powerbase and a sizeable number of @entity98			0
in may 2010 @entity23 won 41 seats , the @entity98 11 , the @entity100 six while the @entity35 secured just one mp			0
first minister @entity102 has been buoyed by polls showing a narrowing between the @entity10 and no campaigns so far , there has been no decision on what would happen to @entity4 's @entity8 seats between parliamentary elections and march 2016 , when it would become an independent nation , in the event of a yes vote this autumn			1
it is widely assumed that elections would continue as usual but @entity4 mps would then vacate their seats when links are severed			1
tories believe it would unacceptable , however , for them to hold their seats while @entity122 and @entity60 were negotiating the break - up of the @entity124 @entity4 - born @entity125 , who represents @entity126 , told @entity127 : ‘ why should the peoples of @entity129 , @entity130 and @entity131 have laws passed in this @entity133 by mps who for all intents and purposes are about to be part of a foreign country ? ’ @entity58 insists mr @entity18 is focussed on winning the referendum to keep @entity4 in the @entity124 , so the issue will not arise			1
but privately many @entity17 believe his position will be untenable if voters back independence			0
a no 10 source said : ‘ the prime minister is focused on making the case for @entity4 to remain part of the @entity124			0
’ a record 4.1million @entity4 are now registered to vote as more people sign up to take part in the independence referendum			0
the figure is almost 60,000 more than in december 2012 and has been fuelled by 16 and 17 - yearolds who are not eligible to take part in @entity154 or @entity4 elections but can do so in the referendum			0
around 92,000 out of a possible 120,000 young @entity4 have signed up			0
the figures have been compiled by the @entity159 's 15 @entity4 electoral registration officers ( @entity160 ) , following an annual canvas of voters between october 2013 and march 2014			0
the deadline to register to vote in the independence referendum is september 2 , 2014			0
@entity165 , head of the @entity4 office at the @entity159 , said : ' the snapshot provided by the publication of the electoral registers gives an indication of the hard work already put in by electoral registration officers , but that hard work does n't stop now			0
' the @entity160 will continue to encourage as many people who are eligible to register to take action and get themselves registered before the september 2 deadline , in order to take part in the referendum			0
' the commission will support @entity160 activities by launching a public awareness campaign in the summer , reminding people that the only way to vote at the referendum is to be on the register			0

narrowing of *opinion* polls heaps pressure on @entity18
senior @entity17 warn he could go down in history as @entity194 who lost the union
there are even calls from @entity17 to oust @entity4 mps before 2015
