by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter published : 19:13 est , 21 june 2013 updated : 06:33 est , 22 june 2013 the @entity3 has charged former @entity6 contractor @entity4 with espionage and theft of government property in the @entity6 surveillance case			1
officials have also asked the @entity13 authorities to extradite the former government contracter who leaked the details of the @entity6 's top secret @entity18 data collection programme			1
@entity4 , believed to be holed up in @entity13 , has admitted providing information to the news media about two highly classified @entity6 surveillance programs			1
a one - page criminal complaint unsealed friday in federal court in @entity24 , @entity25 , says @entity4 engaged in unauthorized communication of national defense information and willful communication of classified communications intelligence information			1
@entity6 whistleblower @entity4 has been charged with espionage and theft and @entity33 officials are seeking his extradition from @entity13 both are charges under the @entity37			1
@entity4 also is charged with theft of government property			1
all three crimes carry a maximum 10 - year prison penalty			0
the federal court in the @entity43 where the complaint was filed is headquarters for @entity4 's former employer , government contractor @entity47			1
the complaint is dated june 14 , five days after @entity4 's name first surfaced as the leaker of information about the two programs in which the @entity6 gathered telephone and @entity56 records to ferret out terror plots			2
the complaint could become an integral part of a @entity33 government effort to have @entity4 extradited from @entity13 , a process that could turn into a prolonged legal battle			1
@entity4 could contest extradition on grounds of political persecution			2
in general , the extradition agreement between the @entity33 and @entity13 excepts political offenses from the obligation to turn over a person			2
sen. @entity70 , @entity71 , a member of the @entity72 , welcomed the charges			0
' i 've always thought this was a treasonous act , ' he said in a statement			0
' i hope @entity13 's government will take him into custody and extradite him to the @entity33 ' helping hand : @entity81 spokesman @entity80 , left , approached @entity82 on behalf of @entity4 and his middleman			1
@entity84 , right , also sought help from @entity82 ahead of @entity81 ' releases @entity82 has a reputation for promoting internet freedoms and has long been discussed as an option for @entity4			1
as a @entity33 citizen , @entity4 would not need a visa to enter @entity82 and could immediately apply for asylum			1
he would be free to live in @entity82 while immigration authorities decide his case , which could take more than a year , experts have said			2
but if @entity4 wants to seek refuge in @entity82 , he 'll have to get there first			2
and this is where the @entity33 could have a chance			0
@entity101 will sometimes issue a ' red notice ' - which is like an international arrest warrant - but keep it sealed so that the person does n't know it exists			1
if he tried to travel , he would be arrested at the airport			0
if he did get to @entity82 , it is unknown if he would be safe			0
the government of newly - elected prime minister @entity110 is believed to be closer to @entity111 than past administrations and less keen to foster the country 's cyber-haven image			0
' i would be very surprised if they ( the government ) would be eager to engage in any international disputes with the @entity33 and it is pretty difficult to be granted asylum here , ' @entity115 , lecturer in political science at the @entity117 , told @entity123			2
' i think what this guy is saying is based on something he is imagining or hoping for rather than actual facts			0
' @entity82 does have an extradition treaty with the @entity33 , but it is unclear if it would cover any crimes that he might be charged with			1
@entity132 , a retired 30 - year veteran with the @entity133 who served from 1990 to 1994 as the legal liaison officer at the @entity33 consulate in @entity13 , said ' relations between @entity33 and @entity13 law enforcement personnel are historically quite good			1
' ' in my time , i felt the degree of cooperation was outstanding to the extent that i almost felt i was in an @entity133 field office , ' said @entity132			0
the @entity33 and @entity13 cooperate on law enforcement matters and have a standing agreement on the surrender of fugitives			2
however , @entity4 's appeal rights could drag out any extradition proceeding			0
the success or failure of any extradition proceeding depends on what the suspect is charged with under @entity33 law and how it corresponds to @entity13 law under the treaty			1
in order for @entity13 officials to honor the extradition request , they have to have some applicable statute under their law that corresponds with a violation of @entity33 law			1
news of the charges broke on friday evening , the same day it emerged that @entity4 could be flown to @entity82 from @entity13 by the whistleblowing website @entity81			1
a businessman connected to the controversial website said a chartered private jet is ready for the 30 - year - old , who fled to @entity13 after leaking @entity33 security details			1
it comes after @entity82 admitted holding talks with @entity4 over the possibility of seeking political asylum			2
@entity178 , head of @entity180 , which handles donations to @entity81 , revealed details of the private jet			0
speaking to @entity184 television , he said : ' everything is ready on our side and the plane could take off tomorrow			0
' we have really done all we can do			0
we have a plane and all the logistics in place			0
' the jet is believed to belong to a @entity194 firm and has been chartered at a cost of $ 240,000			0
@entity81 founder @entity84 revealed on wednesday he had been in contact with @entity4 's representatives to discuss his possible bid for asylum in @entity82			1
the former @entity33 government contractor fled to @entity13 on may 20 after leaking @entity6 programs			1
it also emerged that a contractor for the @entity6 found possible discrepancies in a resume submitted by @entity4 , but the company still employed him , a source said on thursday			0
@entity4 was hired this spring after he convinced his hiring screeners at @entity47 , that his description of his education was truthful			0
it is unclear precisely which element of @entity4 's resume caused personnel officials at @entity47 to raise questions about his background			2
also unclear is how he satisfied their concerns			0
@entity47 has said in a statement that ' we will work closely with our clients and authorities in their investigation of this matter			0
' @entity4 fled his home in @entity226 , where he worked for @entity6 contractor @entity47 , after exposing the @entity33 government 's top surveillance secrets			1
he is at a secret location in @entity13			0
in a column in @entity82 daily newspaper @entity231 , @entity81 spokesman @entity80 wrote that a middleman had approached him on behalf of @entity4			1
' on 2 june , i received a message from @entity4 where he asked me to notify the @entity82 government that he wanted to seek asylum in @entity82 , ' @entity80 , who is also an investigative journalist in @entity82 , told @entity123			1
support : @entity4 's image is displayed in @entity13 , where the whistleblower is currently in hiding he added that he has yet to receive a response from officials about his request but said they have a ' moral obligation ' to answer the call for help			1
the @entity82 government , which has refused to say whether they would grant asylum to @entity4 , confirmed it had received the message from @entity80			1
' @entity80 has contacted two ministries in an informal way but not the ministers , ' a government spokesman said			0
' there has been no formal approach in this matter			0
' @entity80 would not identify who the middleman was			0
@entity4 has previously mentioned @entity82 as a possible refuge			2
@entity82 has a reputation for promoting @entity56 freedoms , but @entity4 has said did not travel there immediately from the @entity33 as he feared the country could be pressured by @entity111			1
' @entity82 could be pushed harder , quicker , before the public could have a chance to make their feelings known , and i would not put that past the current @entity33 administration , ' @entity4 said in an online forum in the @entity271 on monday			1
it had been suggested that he would actually flee to the @entity82 consulate in @entity13 , rather than risking boarding a plane to fly there in person			2
safety : @entity82 has a reputation for promoting internet freedoms			0
@entity279 is pictured @entity82 officials told @entity281 last week that @entity4 is missing a key element			2
' the main stipulation for seeking asylum in @entity82 would be that the person must be in @entity82 to start the process , ' said @entity287 , the chief spokesman for @entity82 's @entity288 in @entity279			0
' that would be the ground rule no. 1			0
' @entity81 founder @entity84 , who is holed up in the @entity292 embassy in @entity293 to avoid extradition to @entity295 for questioning over allegations of sex crimes , visited @entity82 several times in the run - up to some of the website 's major releases			1
yet some experts added that @entity82 might not be as welcoming as @entity4 hopes			2
the government of newly - elected prime minister @entity110 has not been tested in relation to these cases , but is believed to be closer to @entity111 than past administrations and less keen to foster the country 's cyber-haven image			0
' i would be very surprised if they ( the government ) would be eager to engage in any international disputes with the @entity33 and it is pretty difficult to be granted asylum here , ' @entity115 , lecturer in political science at the @entity117 , told @entity123			2
' i think what this guy is saying is based on something he is imagining or hoping for rather than actual facts			0
