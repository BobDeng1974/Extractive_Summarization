by @entity0 published : 06:56 est , 4 december 2012 updated : 09:08 est , 4 december 2012 a cruel pet owner who kept two marmosets in appalling conditions at his squalid home has been banned from keeping monkeys for life			1
disabled @entity7 , 53 , from @entity8 , @entity9 , forced six - month - old @entity10 and two - year - old @entity11 to perch on a curtain pole or crawl into a dirty tube slung underneath			1
the animals were kept in ' heartbreaking ' conditions in a room littered with , cigarette butts , faeces , and a razor blade , and forced to travel in @entity7 's pocket when he drove around town			1
' heartbreaking ' : @entity11 the marmoset clings to a curtain rail at @entity7 's @entity8 home			1
the two - year - old primate was kept a litter strewn room with six - month - old @entity10 without specialist food or suitable perching room @entity30 : underweight and in a bad state of health rattler hangs on to the wooden curtain pole in the living room on friday @entity8 @entity35 slapped @entity7 with a lifelong ban on keeping monkeys after he pleaded guilty to neglect at an earlier hearing			1
he was given a two year conditional discharge and ordered to pay £ 2,000 in costs			0
@entity43 inspector @entity42 visited @entity7 ’s home last year with primate experts from @entity46 , in @entity47 , and found the monkeys living in appalling conditions			1
a razor blade , cigarette butts and faeces were scattered across the floor and there was no specialised food or suitable perching room needed for their care			1
she said : ' it was heartbreaking to see these poor little marmosets like this – their fur was sticky with faeces and urine and they were clearly underweight and in a bad state of health			0
' @entity10 , the little one , was just crouched inside a dirty tube set up beneath the curtain rail while @entity11 was balanced precariously on top of it			0
' there was so little room for both of them that at one point @entity11 knocked @entity10 off the perch – she had quite a fall to the hard floor			2
' it is hard to understand how anyone could think this was an acceptable way to keep an animal			0
' @entity10 : after @entity87 was rescued by the @entity43 she was found to be suffering from the early stages of rickets this was the @entity43 ’s third major case involving cruelty or neglect to a marmoset since january in what is a growing trade in keeping them as pets			1
dr @entity99 , primatologist for the @entity43 , said : ' these cases show exactly why we are calling for a ban on primates such as pets			1
marmosets are seen as small and easy to keep but this is far from the truth - they are very hard to look after and totally unsuitable as pets			2
' we must stop this growing trade			0
breeders and dealers charge large sums of money and it has become far too easy to pick up a marmoset over the internet , especially since you do n’t need a licence to have one			0
' @entity10 and @entity11 were removed and taken to @entity46 where it was found they were suffering from the early stages of rickets , or metabolic bone disease			0
after being given specialist care and lessons in how to feed , talk and socialise from fellow marmoset @entity129 , they are now growing and doing well			0
' monkey man ' @entity7 , 53 , pleaded guilty to neglect speaking after the hearing @entity7 said he was ' upset ' about what had happened and that the @entity43 had been too quick to judge the conditions in his flat			1
the unemployed father - of - three , who still keeps a pair of zebra finches , said : ' they came on a particular morning when i was n’t expecting them			0
' i was dealing with some issues that morning and had n’t got round to doing the housework			0
' normally it would n’t have been that dirty			0
' @entity7 , who was disabled by a stroke , said the two marmosets had been able to play on ropes he had attached to the ceiling of his lounge			1
he had covered these with plastic ivy leaves to make the room look like a jungle			2
it was one of these that the court heard one of the monkeys had eaten			2
he said : ' i was well known in @entity8 where they used to call me the monkey man as i rode around in my mobility scooter with a marmoset in my pocket			0
' he said the @entity43 had previously been involved with him in june 2010 when he lost a 10 - year - old marmoset called @entity165 in @entity8 city centre			1
he had tripped allowing @entity167 , who lived in a dolls house , to run away			0
marmosets originate from @entity170 and usually live in the upper canopy of trees in forests			2
@entity46 are campaigning to change laws that govern the keeping of primates as pets in @entity178			2
dr @entity179 , director of @entity46 , said : ' we are an international primate rescue and rehabilitation centre , but more and more we find ourselves being called to rescue and rehabilitate monkeys being kept as pets legally in @entity178 today			1
' for more information about the campaign go to @entity46			0

@entity7 , 53 , barred from keeping monkeys after @entity43 and primate experts step in
