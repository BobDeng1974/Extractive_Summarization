the rare specimen , which is an incredible 11.4ft ( 3.5 metres ) high and 18ft ( 5.5 metres ) long , is expected to attract bidders from both museums and private collectors ' nearly complete skeletons are pretty rare			1
this is a fabulous skeleton in pretty good condition , ' he told @entity25 at @entity26			0
' all sorts of people are collectors			1
the most famous ones are @entity31 and @entity32			0
it 's something to really show off about			0
' the woolly mammoth is thought to be a male who would have weighed over six tonnes when it roamed @entity37 10,000 years ago			1
@entity38 and @entity39 from @entity40 give the enormous mammoth a final dusting			1
anyone with with enough room to house this skeleton can now bid for it at @entity40 in @entity47 resurrecting a prehistoric creature might seem like a sci - fi dream , but scientists say they have taken a step towards cloning the extinct woolly mammoth and there is a ' high chance ' it will happen			1
experts expect to extract ‘ high quality dna ’ from a 43,000 - year - old carcass found in @entity58			1
the announcement follows the autopsy on the female mammoth found last year in permafrost in @entity65 's diamond region of the @entity66 , which is also known as @entity66			2
there was palpable excitement among the team which included scientists from @entity65 , the @entity72 , the @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 and @entity76 , ’ @entity67 reported			0
the researchers expect test results on blood extracted from the woolly mammoth to provide the genetic material needed to attempt to clone the animal			2
woolly mammoths finally died out in eastern @entity58 around 4,000 years ago			0
@entity84 , vice president of the @entity65 @entity85 , said : ‘ the data we are about to receive will give us a high chance to clone the mammoth			1
’ but he called for responsibility in bringing the ancient beast back to life , urging that competing teams seeking to win a race to clone the mammoth , not to play @entity95 for the sake of it			2
@entity8 , director of @entity9 that is selling the mammoth , says the @entity11 remains could fetch up to £ 250,000 ( $ 409,000 ) @entity98 , of @entity9 , said : ' what ’s exceptional about this one is it ’s more or less complete with two magnificent tusks			2
there are one or two toes missing			0
' it looks very impressive , the inside curve of the tusks is about 8ft ( 2.4 metres )			2
it ’s bigger than an elephant			0
' it would have been covered in long fur on top , with a shorter undercoat			2
although quite similar to today 's elephant , it had smaller ears and a shorter tail to retain heat			0
its habitat was the mammoth steppe , stretching across northern @entity120 and @entity121 , so its diet was mainly grass and rushes , which explains why it only had four molar teeth and curved tusks			2
the woolly mammoth co-existed with early humans , who hunted them for food and used their bones and tusks for making art. woolly mammoths and modern - day elephants are closely related , sharing 99.4 per cent of their genes			0
mammoth remains can be dated from the rings on the tusks			0
a thick line denotes a year and a thinner line the weeks and days in between			0
their trunks had two finger - like projections at the end to help them pluck vegetation			0
@entity149 scientists are working on a project to bring the species back from extinction using @entity153 from a carcass and an egg from an elephant which will act as the surrogate mother			0
the species gets its name from the @entity65 ‘ mammut ’ , meaning earth mole , because it was once believed they lived underground and died on contact with light – explaining why they were always half - buried			0
up until now , the mammoth has been part of an old @entity169 private collection			1
due to its huge size , it has only been pieced together recently			1
' to the best of my knowledge , i do n’t think there has been one sold at auction , certainly not in the @entity72 and i do n’t think in @entity178 , so it ’s a first in that respect , ' said mr @entity98			1
' it could either go to a museum or if you have a big conservatory it would definitely make a serious statement			0
' it ’s not like a number 14 bus , there is n’t going to be another one coming along			0
' the mammoth will be sold at @entity190 on wednesday , 26 november in @entity191 , @entity47			1
