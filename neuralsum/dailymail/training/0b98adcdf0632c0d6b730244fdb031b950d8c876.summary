if your snoring is the bane of your partner 's life , then you might just have a new excuse			0
scientists have discovered that the tongues of some people who snore are extra large			0
it 's already well - known that being overweight or obese increases the risk of obstructive sleep apnoea ( @entity12 ) , which leads to snoring because the airway becomes blocked			1
until now , it was thought that a large neck was to blame			0
obese people with obstructive sleep apnoea ( @entity12 ) - which causes snoring - were found to have larger tongues than those without the condition , due to extra fat deposits in their tongues now , however scientists say piling on the pounds can also cause a fat tongue - which may well be the culprit			1
@entity26 researchers found that obese people with @entity12 had a higher percentage of tongue fat - especially at the base of their tongues - which made their tongues larger overall			1
this was compared with obese people who did n't suffer from the sleep condition			1
increased tongue fat might prevent the tongue 's muscles from positioning the tongue away from the airway , causing snoring because the airway becomes blocked , researchers said			1
they added the study might provide an explanation for the link between obesity and sleep apnoea - and said screening to identify fat tongues may could help diagnose the condition			1
it 's known that obesity is a major cause of obstructive sleep apnoea , a condition where the throat closes repeatedly during the night			1
snoring occurs because the airways become narrowed , or even completely blocked , preventing the body from getting enough oxygen			0
in severe cases , the brain jolts the body awake , causing the airway to reopen			0
the person may wake up repeatedly without knowing it , increasing their heart rate and blood pressure and preventing deep sleep			0
@entity12 is a relatively common condition that affects more men than women			0
most cases of @entity12 develop in people aged 30 to 60 years old , although it can affect people of all ages , including children			2
in the @entity77 , it is estimated around 4 per cent of middle - aged men and 2 per cent of middle - aged women have @entity12			0
treatment options for @entity12 include : lifestyle changes – such as losing weight , cutting down on alcohol and sleeping on your side using a continuous positive airway pressure ( @entity88 ) device – these devices prevent your airway closing while you sleep by delivering a continuous supply of compressed air through a mask wearing a mandibular advancement device ( @entity95 ) – this gum shield - like device fits around your teeth , holding your jaw and tongue forward to increase the space at the back of your throat while you sleep surgery – this is considered as a last resort if @entity12 is thought to be the caused by a physical problem that can be corrected surgically , such as an unusual inner neck structure source : @entity110 long term , sleep apnoea is linked with a number of chronic diseases , including high blood pressure , heart disease , type 2 diabetes , stroke and depression			1
the new study , carried out at the @entity121 , involved 90 obese adults with @entity12 and 31 adults without it			2
the participants underwent mri scans to obtain a high - resolution image of their upper airways , and the fat deposits in their tongues were analysed			0
in addition to making the tongue larger , increased tongue fat might affect the way muscles attach the tongue to bone , preventing these muscles from positioning the tongue away from the airway , the researchers said			1
future studies should look at whether removing tongue fat through losing weight , carrying out upper airway exercises or surgery would work as a treatment for @entity12 , they added			1
dr. @entity146 , of the @entity121 in the @entity26 said : ' this is the first study to show that fat deposits are increased in the tongue of obese patients with obstructive sleep apnea			1
' dr @entity152 , president of the @entity153 said doctors should look at tongue size when screening for @entity12			2
he said : ' @entity157 size is one of the physical features that should be evaluated by a physician when screening obese patients to determine their risk for obstructive sleep apnoea			1
' effective identification and treatment of sleep apnoea is essential to optimally manage other conditions associated with this chronic disease , including high blood pressure , heart disease , ttype 2 diabetes , stroke and depression			2
' the study was published in the journal @entity176			0
in september , a @entity178 doctor who snored for years due to @entity12 performed surgery on his own tongue to cure the problem			2
he claims the procedure , in which he put tunnels on the back of his tongue to stop it from collapsing , has worked and he no longer snores			0
in the @entity77 , it is estimated around 4 per cent of middle - aged men and 2 per cent of middle - aged women have @entity12			0
experts say doctors could begin screening tongue size in order to diagnose the condition			2

being overweight or obese causes obstructive sleep apnoea ( @entity12 )
this is where the throat closes repeatedly during the night
study found obese people with @entity12 had bigger , fatter tongues
increased tongue fat stopped muscles positioning it away from the airway
experts said doctors should screen for fat tongues to help manage obesity
