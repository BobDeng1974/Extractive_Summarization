by @entity0 published : 21:15 est , 13 november 2012 updated : 05:54 est , 14 november 2012 community spirit : @entity2 , @entity0 and @entity4 hunt for the nation 's best amateur dramatic company @entity8 bricklayer @entity7 pauses with a lump of wet mortar on his trowel			1
after changing into character , the nasal - voiced , side - whiskered mr @entity7 , 63 , starts spouting @entity13			2
' mistress @entity14 , ' he cries			2
' i would thy husband were dead : i 'll speak it before the best lord			2
i would make thee my @entity21 ! ' and with that he throws back his head and gives a filthy , @entity24 - style laugh before returning to his wall			2
@entity26 is one of @entity28 's large , neglected tribes : the amateur dramaticals			1
there are thousands of them up and down the land			2
some act well , some appallingly			2
some sew costumes , some paint backdrops , some do the make - up and some boss everyone around while directing the shows			2
@entity28 's am - dram scene is lively , growing - but is often sneered at by the wider world			1
am - drams ? oh , you say , that 's ham actors standing with their feet at a ' quarter - to - three ' angle in front of wonky props			1
that 's prompters in the wings shouting lines at half - deaf thespians			1
having just taken part - as the @entity59 's theatre critic - in a tv talent show about am - drams , i can tell you they 're on a roll			1
or rather , a role			2
@entity7 belongs to the @entity66 from @entity67 on the @entity8 - @entity69 border			2
he is about to play sir @entity70 in an @entity8 take of @entity14 ( the wives are done up like ageing @entity73 )			0
fellow stalwarts in the troupe , which was founded in 1967 , include a marine surveyor , a @entity78 car dealer , a teacher and a civil servant			0
that , anyway , is what they do by day			0
by night they become a host of characters			0
as the saying went on @entity88 's @entity87 : ' tonight , @entity88 , i am going to be			1
' the same happens in @entity89 , where salesman @entity90 is pumping himself up into a frenzy of sexual anger - in order ( let it hurriedly be said ) to play @entity94			0
thirty - something @entity90 belongs to the @entity95 , where his fellow actors include a dustman and a carer for the elderly			1
am - drams were last week pooh - poohed by @entity103 opera critic @entity102 , who wrote of ' self - managing , largely middle - class adult groups performing extant plays or musicals in the village hall or community theatre '			1
pausing only to ask ' er , what 's wrong with middle - class ? ' , one has to conclude that the normally fair - minded mr @entity102 is speaking out of his exhaust pipe			1
when i signed up as a judge on @entity115 's @entity114 ( along with impresario @entity4 and actress @entity2 ) i did not know what to expect			1
@entity115 had invited the am - dram societies of @entity28 to submit audition tapes			1
the winner would get the chance to stage a production in @entity103 's @entity122 - which , to am - drammers , is like getting to play a match at @entity124			1
entries were whittled down to a long list of 20			0
some of the productions were , admittedly , as wooden as the @entity128			0
some actors wore @entity131 - style eye make - up to play @entity133 tragedy			1
murdered by mascara ! some waved their hands in the air - woooo - like @entity138 's people			1
but some of the auditions were top rate			0
for instance , @entity143 's @entity142 had done a version of the witches scene in @entity147			1
this is a minefield even for professional actors			1
there is always a danger , with all those toad and newt giblets , that the audience will start splurffing with laughter instead of feeling spooked			0
@entity158 's amateurs set the scene in a gay bar , casting the witches as three camp old men			1
those taking part included @entity167 worker @entity166 , 51 , with an @entity169 - style hairnet on his head , who hissed and bitched to a high order			0
the @entity173 would have been proud to call his interpretation their own			0
the same was true when @entity175 , from @entity176 , gave us their take on the ' mechanicals ' scene from @entity181			0
@entity182 's @entity114 reflects the country 's lively community theatre scene @entity186 brings together talent from all walks of life , from brickies to single mothers they did it in a strong @entity195 dialect which , far from making the scene incomprehensible , made it soar in the most unexpected way			1
@entity198 and his mates can come across as clumping idiots with accents like @entity202 from @entity203			0
here they were sparky rustics , eyes a-gleam ( with excitement and terror ) at the thought of doing some acting			0
@entity211 's members include a sheep farmer , a schoolmaster and a mother who is full - time carer for her disabled child			1
these are time - starved people , yet they carve a few precious hours out of every week to devote themselves to the arts			0
more than 2,500 am - dram groups belong to the @entity218			0
these are run by volunteers who come in after a day 's work , grab a bite to eat , then dash off to rehearsals with a disparate band of neighbours			1
every few weeks , along comes show - night - the roar of the greasepaint , the smell of the crowd			1
and then the all - important cast party , where thirsts are quenched and romances may be forged			0
' it 's a cracking way to meet women , ' laughs @entity7			2
' not at my age , though - that 's long gone ! ' @entity238 sir @entity70 might not agree			2
hair - salon receptionist @entity239 , who acts with @entity241 's @entity240 , says am - drams are ' a massive part of who i am			2
acting for me is the same as eating , breathing , sleeping			0
' sound engineer @entity247 , 44 , from @entity89 , says directing the @entity95 is the biggest thing in his life			0
sitting in the group 's theatre , he says simply : ' this is my real home			2
' having long watched the likes of @entity254 and @entity28 's @entity255 , i 'd suspected talent shows whipped up participants into false states of emotion			1
from my judge 's seat on @entity182 's @entity114 , i saw genuine tears and cheers			1
winners of @entity182 's @entity114 will get the chance to stage a production on @entity103 's @entity122 when the 20 - year - olds from @entity268 's @entity270 community theatre company were told they had made it to the next round , they reacted like @entity274 footballers after scoring a goal - though they did not rip off their shirts which , given the curvaceousness of some of the group 's actresses , was just as well			1
why do people devote so much time to am - drams ? various reasons			0
for @entity286 , 44 , director of @entity211 , it is ' a release '			0
she has a disabled son at home			0
' drama gives me something else to focus on , ' she says			0
for mother - of - seven @entity296 , from the @entity295 , am - dram is a return to a life she had once hoped to follow before babies intervened			0
' i 'd like to think perhaps i could have made it as an actress , ' says mrs @entity304 , 55			0
so is it all a middle - class self - indulgence ? @entity307			0
am - drams embody the best of @entity28 community spirit			1
and i say that without the slightest need for a prompt .			0

new tv show nation 's @entity114 is the *x-factor* for thespians
the passion of @entity28 's amateur actors ' embodies community spirit '
