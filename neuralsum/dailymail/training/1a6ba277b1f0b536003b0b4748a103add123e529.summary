months after the death of the @entity3 , its surviving twin has reached the rim of a vast crater to begin its final and most important exploration			0
opportunity will now examine rocks older than any it has seen in its seven years on the surface of the red planet , @entity8 scientists said last night			1
the solar - powered , six - wheel rover arrived at the 14mile - wide @entity15 after driving 13miles from a smaller crater named @entity17			1
final destination : after trundling across @entity24 for three years , opportunity images a portion of the west rim of @entity15 where it arrived late on tuesday , scientists said last night the rover will now examine rocks older than any it has seen in its seven years on the surface of the red planet opportunity and its twin spirit landed on opposite sides of @entity24 in 2004 and used their instruments to discover geologic evidence that the cold , dusty planet was once wet the journey , which took nearly three years culminated on tuesday when @entity29 signalled it had arrived at the location dubbed @entity37 in honour of the rover 's twin , which fell silent last year			1
' we 're there , ' said project manager @entity43 of @entity8 's @entity44			0
opportunity and spirit landed on opposite sides of @entity24 in 2004 and used their instruments to discover geologic evidence that the cold and dusty planet was once wet			2
craters can provide windows into the planet 's past because layers of material from long - ago eras are exposed			2
the journey , which took nearly three years culminated on tuesday when @entity29 signalled it had arrived at the location dubbed @entity37 in honour of the rover 's twin , which fell silent last year explorer : an artist 's impression of what opportunity looks like as it trundles across the @entity61 ( left ) and this image on the right was taken as it made its way to the @entity24 's vast @entity15 last month mr @entity43 said the plan is to drive a bit closer to the rim to take pictures of the oldest rocks seen by @entity29			1
he said : ' this is a brand new mission			0
' since landing , @entity29 has studied sulphate sediments that pointed to an environment that was once wetter and warmer			0
' now we have rocks that pre-date that , ' mr @entity43 said			0
the rover 's work is part of @entity8 's @entity81 strategy known as ' follow the water ' , which looks for evidence that liquid water once existed or perhaps still exists on the planet			1
liquid water is considered essential for the potential for some form of life to have developed			0
almost there : opportunity used its panoramic camera to capture this view of a portion of @entity15 's rim last week after a drive during the rover 's 2,676th day of working on @entity24 last week , research based on observations by @entity8 's @entity100 theorised that dark , finger - like features that appear in spring and summer on some @entity24 slopes then fade in winter could be flows of briny water			1
@entity105 would be necessary to lower the freezing temperature of water			0
a big , new @entity8 rover named @entity109 is awaiting launch from @entity111 , @entity112 , on a $ 2.5billion mission to explore a towering mountain inside a 96mile - wide crater to determine if there were once conditions capable of supporting microbial life			2
@entity109 , powered by a radioisotope instead of sunlight , is expected to land on @entity24 in august 2012 .			2

@entity15 is a 14mile - wide depression near the @entity24 *equator*
it is likely to be the rover 's final destination
opportunity will now examine rocks older than any it has seen in its seven years on the surface of the red planet
