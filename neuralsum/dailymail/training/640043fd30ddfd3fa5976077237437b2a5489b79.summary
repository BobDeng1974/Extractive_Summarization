by @entity1 reporter published : 19:05 est , 17 november 2012 updated : 03:31 est , 18 november 2012 new debate : justice secretary @entity3 will bring the @entity4 before parliament mps will be given the opportunity to deny prisoners the vote in a last - minute move aimed at ending a bitter seven - year dispute over a @entity13 ruling			1
the @entity15 's current blanket ban on prisoners voting has been judged as unlawful by the @entity13 ( @entity17 ) and officials in @entity19 have given the government until friday to comply with the ruling			1
justice secretary @entity3 will this week table a @entity4 that includes options to give some inmates the right to vote after judges ruled that a blanket ban breached human rights			1
these could include giving the vote to those sentenced to less than six months , or extending the franchise to prisoners locked up for under four years			0
but the draft legislation will also have a proposal to retain the status quo as demanded by @entity37 , who has said the idea of prisoners voting makes him feel sick			2
only a few @entity40 are likely to rebel over the issue			0
ministers believe putting the choices before @entity45 will satisfy the @entity13 , which ordered @entity15 to take ‘ concrete measures ’ to resolve the issue this year			1
but critics claim it could mean disenfranchised prisoners being handed £ 100 million in compensation if the court decides the @entity4 does not go far enough			1
the issue was put before the @entity54 in a non-binding vote last year , where @entity6 rejected it			1
the court has given @entity15 until friday to comply with its ruling			2
a government source said : ‘ the deadline is coming up and we are going to be putting forward some sort of draft @entity4			2
’ but the prime minister has made it clear he would not be letting prisoners get the vote			0
he said told the @entity54 last month : ' i do not want prisoners to have the vote , and they should not get the vote - i am very clear about that			0
' if it helps to have another vote in @entity45 on another resolution to make it absolutely clear and help put the legal position beyond doubt , i am happy to do that			0
' but no one should be in any doubt : prisoners are not getting the vote under this government			0
' ' sickening ' : prime minister @entity37 has said the idea of prisoners voting makes him feel sick and he wants to retain the status quo last february , the @entity54 called by an overwhelming margin of 234 to 22 for the blanket ban to be maintained			1
there is a risk that this week 's @entity54 vote could set up another clash with the @entity17 , who could fine the government if it does not comply with its ruling			0
attorney general @entity95 has warned against defying the @entity19 court , saying it 's ruling imposes an international legal obligation on the @entity15			2
justice secretary @entity3 has said @entity45 has the right in law to tell the @entity17 that it does not accept its ruling			0
but added there would be ' consequences ' for the @entity15 's position in @entity105 if mps do chose to defy the judgment			2
in 2005 , the @entity108 said it was up to individual countries to decide which prisoners should be denied the right to vote from jail , but that a total ban was illegal			0
human rights : options could include giving the vote to those sentenced to less than six months , or prisoners locked up for under four years			1

judges ruled that a blanket ban breached human rights
@entity13 has ordered @entity15 to to resolve the issue this year
new @entity4 to look at other voting options for inmates
