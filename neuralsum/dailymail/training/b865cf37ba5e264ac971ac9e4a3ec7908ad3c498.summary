by @entity0 published : 06:59 est , 22 april 2013 updated : 08:45 est , 22 april 2013 @entity1 is not the only @entity3 dynasty which dominates its field - the @entity5 is equally triumphant when it comes to quizzes			1
the institution has won three of the past 11 editions of @entity11 , and tonight it competes in the semi-final of the tournament in a bid to land yet another title			1
but @entity17 's success is not just a fluke - many attribute the university 's dominance to its long - serving coach , who is known as the ' @entity22 of the quiz world ' in homage to his track record			2
@entity26 , a former contestant in his own student days , has been training the @entity17 whizkids for a decade and a half			1
@entity17 is the reigning champion , having won in 2012 as well as 2009 and 2006			0
in addition , the university was runner - up in 2007 and reached the semi-final in 2005 , 2008 and 2010 - an unparalleled record of success on the popular general knowledge show			0
mr @entity26 , a 47 - year - old university librarian , has been the brains behind this spectacular run of form , as he has taken on the responsibility of selecting and coaching the four - man team each year			1
successful : this year 's @entity17 team , pictured , is hoping to take the @entity11 title ' some people have called me the @entity22 of the quiz world , ' he told the @entity60			1
' i do n't know about that - i 've been doing this for 15 years whereas he 's been in the job for at least 25			1
' when he captained the @entity17 team in 1996 , he failed to win the competition - but he has been making up for it ever since with a string of victories for his proteg√©s			0
mr @entity26 's first duty comes in selecting the four men and women who will represent @entity17 on @entity11			2
he uses a written trivia test to draw up a shortlist of a dozen contenders , then tests their reflexes on the all - important buzzer			0
victory : mr @entity26 's success with the show hosted by @entity37 , left , has seen him compared with @entity1 manager sir @entity22 , right it is not enought just to pick the four most knowledgeable candidates , as their specialities must be sufficiently broad to cover all the subject areas which may come up in the quiz			1
mr @entity26 says that he would ideally have a scientist , a geographer , a historian and a literary specialist - and emphasises that they must all get on together			2
when it comes to coaching , he prefers running practice sessions which replicate the conditions of the show rather than learning compendious bodies of knowledge , such as lists of @entity103 laureates			0
and while @entity11 may seem like something of a distraction from the core purpose of an educational establishment , tv success can in fact boost the institution academically as well			0
@entity111 , 24 , an economics student representing @entity17 this year , says he picked the university because of its track record in quizzes			0
he told the @entity60 he thought at the time : ' it must be a very good university if they are so good at @entity11			0

@entity5 has won three of past seven titles on @entity36 quiz
will face @entity122 in semi-final tonight in *attempt* to land another crown
team coached to *glory* for 15 years by librarian @entity26
