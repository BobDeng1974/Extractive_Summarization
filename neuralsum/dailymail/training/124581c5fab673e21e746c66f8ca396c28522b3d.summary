when it was launched , it seemed little more than a pipe dream			2
billionaire inventor @entity2 unveiled a futuristic plan for a new type of transport that would shoot capsules of passengers along a tube at around the speed of sound			1
@entity2 , one of the brains behind the online payment system @entity13 , and @entity14 claims his solar - powered ' hyperloop ' could herald a revolution in travel			1
the @entity19 design for @entity2 's @entity20			1
it hopes to produce a technical feasibility study finished in mid- 2015			2
the team believes the system could link the majority of @entity27 's major cities together			1
@entity37 is pumped into the skis via small holes to make an air cushion , and each pod has air inlets at the front			2
an electric turbo compressor compresses air from the nose and routes it to the skis and to the cabin			2
magnets on the skis , plus an electromagnetic pulse give the pod its initial thrust ; reboosting motors along the route would keep the pod moving at just below the speed of sound so the system does not produce sonic booms			2
@entity2 believes it would take just 30 minutes to travel the 381 miles from @entity60 to @entity61 – half the time it takes in a plane – and likened the passenger experience to @entity65 's rocket ride @entity66			1
now , the plans are beginning to take shape			2
a new firm , @entity19 , is developing plans to makes the tubes a reality - and it has recruited experts from around the world			1
the crowdsourced firm has around 100 engineers on the projects , and nearly all of them have day jobs at companies like @entity81 , @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity84 , @entity14 , and @entity85			1
@entity86 , the ceo of the new company , says it seemed the perfect way to develop the plans , with a site called @entity91 that aimed to crowdsource ideas			2
he got in touch with @entity14 , @entity2 's firm , and the work began			1
the team includes about 25 @entity97 graduate architecture students at a facility in @entity99 , although most members work remotely			1
@entity101 hopes to have a technical feasibility study finished in mid- 2015 , according to @entity103			2
so far , the team has made progress in three main areas : the capsules , the stations , and the route			0
' they look at this like a blank sheet of paper on which they can realize their fantasies , ' @entity97 professor @entity110 said			1
@entity2 's idea is based on the pneumatic tubes that fire capsules of paperwork between floors in offices			1
in this case , the capsules would carry people – even cars – in low - pressure tubes to minimise turbulence and maximise speed			0
@entity2 believes it would take just 30 minutes to travel the 381 miles from @entity60 to @entity61 – half the time it takes in a plane – and likened the passenger experience to @entity65 's rocket ride @entity66			1
on top of pylons is a hovering capsule inside a low - pressurized tube , which can reach speeds of up to 760 mph			0
' the only resistance would be the air in front of the capsule , which we moved to the back by using a compressor , ' @entity20 ceo @entity86 said			0
at its launch , @entity2 described the @entity20 design as looking like a shotgun , with the tubes running side - by - side for most of the journey , then closing at either end to form a loop			1
trains of capsules would shoot through the almost air - free tube at up to 760mph , accelerated by magnets which would also keep each pod on a steady course			0
each capsule would float on a cushion of air it creates as it speeds along – similar to an air hockey table			0
so far , the team has made progress in three main areas : the capsules , the stations , and the route			0
the proposed route of the @entity170 follows @entity171 , which runs through the agriculture - @entity172 in @entity174			0
it would take seven to ten years to build			0
capsules carrying six to eight people would depart every 30 seconds , with tickets costing around £ 13 each way			0
in his proposal released online , @entity2 wrote : ' short of figuring out real teleportation , which would of course be awesome ( someone please do this ) , the only option for super-fast travel is to build a tube over or under the ground that contains a special environment			1
' the proposed route of the first @entity20 follows @entity171 , which runs through the agriculture - rich @entity191 in @entity174			0
it would take seven to ten years to build			0
@entity2 put the price tag at around £ 4billion but pointed out that that is around one - tenth of the projected cost of a high - speed rail system that @entity174 has been planning to build			1
the 100 person team is spread around the world the tyeam has even built models in their bid to find out if @entity20 could actually work however , transport experts received the proposal with scepticism , citing barriers , such as the threat of earthquakes in the region			1
@entity2 has said he is too focused on other projects , for example his rocket building company @entity14 , to consider building the @entity20 , and instead is publishing a design that anyone can use or modify			1
@entity2 said he started thinking about the idea when plans for a 130mph ( 210km/h ) high - speed train connection between @entity60 and @entity61 were revealed , but now he has detailed his own version on @entity220 's site			1
' flight ' of the future : the hyperloop will travel the distance between @entity60 and @entity61 in only 30 minutes smooth ride : ' it would have less lateral acceleration which is what tends to make people feel motion sick than a subway ride , as the pod banks against the tube like an airplane , ' creator @entity2 said ' i originally started thinking about [ @entity20 ] when i read about @entity174 's high - speed rail project which was somewhat disappointing , ' he told a @entity236 with @entity237 last week			1
' it 's actually worse than taking the plane			0
i get a little sad when things are not getting better in the future			0
' another example would be like the @entity243 being retired and the fact there is no supersonic passenger transport			0
i think that is sad			0
you want the future to be better than the past , or at least i do			0
' the entrepreneur made his fortune with the internet payment system @entity13 before switching his skills into developing the new @entity255 rocket system for @entity82 and the @entity220 electric car			2
mr @entity2 claims @entity20 would be a practical solution for city pairs separated by 1,000 miles ( 1,600km ) or less			1
beyond this distance , it would be better to take a plane , he explained			0
unique : travellers would enter aluminium pods which are mounted above the ground on columns 50 to 100 yards apart modern : this image shows how people would travel in the pods but for the shorter distance , his new concept would beat the plane , he argues , because it would not waste time ascending and descending			2
' you want a transport system that is roughly twice as fast as the next best alternative , that costs less , that is safer , that is not subject to weather and is more convenient , ' mr @entity2 said			1
' if there were such a thing , i think most people would take it			0
in fact , it would increase the travel between the city pairs because of the increased convenience			0
' experts say @entity2 's track record could help the plan become a reality			2
' @entity20 is quite an old science fiction idea but @entity2 is the sort of man who could make it work , ' said physicist @entity297 from @entity298			1
space - like : this conceptual design of the machine shows that it will have a futuristic look built to last : the inventor boasted that the tracks would be immune to weather and earthquakes , though it is not immediately clear how so creature comforts : the legroom is said to give would - be passengers a disruption - free ride ' he 's the guy who made electric cars go fast with @entity220 , which many people did n't think would be possible ; and he 's the head of @entity14 which is the only commercial rocket builder that has managed to hook up with the @entity316			0
' @entity2 says he will leave it to others to build the system initially			1
' i have to focus on core @entity220 business and @entity14 business , and that 's more than enough , ' he told investors of @entity220 , his electric car firm			2
' if nothing happens for a few years , with that i mean maybe it could make sense to make the halfway path with @entity220 involvement , ' @entity2 said			2
' @entity20 consists of a low pressure tube with capsules that are transported at both low and high speeds throughout the length of the tube , ' @entity2 said in an exhaustive paper detailing the system posted online			1
' the capsules are supported on a cushion of air			0
' each of the capsules is pressurized , and @entity2 says they have an emergency braking system as well as a reserve air supply in the event of an emergency			1
appealing to environmentalists : this graph shows the energy cost per passenger on different modes of transportation for the specific @entity61 - @entity60 journey there and back : the ' loop ' portion highlights the fact that there would only be two stops he admits the scheme came from a disdain for current systems			0
' when the @entity174 ' high speed ' rail was approved , i was quite disappointed , as i know many others were too			0
' how could it be that the home of @entity369 and @entity370 – doing incredible things like indexing all the world 's knowledge and putting rovers on @entity375 – would build a bullet train that is both one of the most expensive per mile and one of the slowest in the world ? ' @entity2 claims the scheme can power itself through solar energy			1
' by placing solar panels on top of the tube , the @entity20 can generate far in excess of the energy needed to operate			0
' this takes into account storing enough energy in battery packs to operate at night and for periods of extended cloudy weather ' , he claims .			0

@entity2 is working with @entity97 *researchers* to develop system
over 100 engineers have created crowdsourced firm to work on idea
hoped the system could be rolled out in cities around the world
