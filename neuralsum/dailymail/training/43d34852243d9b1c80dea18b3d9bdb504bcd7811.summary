five @entity1 siblings with a unique genetic condition affecting their joints have been told that their condition is so rare that it might be named after them			1
all five children in the @entity7 family in south @entity8 suffer from a disorder that predominately affects their bones and joints - a condition that has stumped doctors around the world			1
their parents @entity15 and @entity7 , both 37 , do not suffer from the disorder , but their children @entity20 , 16 , @entity21 , 14 , @entity22 , nine , @entity23 , eight , and @entity24 , seven , all do			1
the @entity7 children , from @entity8 whose who all suffer the same condition which is so rare it might be named after them ( pictured : @entity20 , 16 , @entity21 , 14 , @entity22 , 9 , @entity23 , 8 , and @entity24 , 7 ) the disease includes symptoms such as a twisted spine , improper bone growth and trouble growing muscle			1
some of the children also have learning difficulties because of the condition - which affects all the children to different degrees of severity			1
and after half - a - decade of research doctors could now even name the condition - @entity41			1
cat said : ' doctors from all over the world have been left puzzled by the condition affecting my children			1
the @entity7 children with their father ( left ) @entity7 and their mother ( right ) cat ' dna samples have been sent to experts at @entity54 and @entity56 universities			1
' they have even sent dna to experts in @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 and @entity63 as part of ongoing research - but no known syndrome has been discovered yet			2
' teaching assistant cat added : ' it seems to affect all the joints in their bodies mainly			1
' so they are either unusable - because they are so stiff - or so overly flexible that they dislocate constantly			2
' @entity21 ’s fingers used to dislocate around 50 times a day			2
' he used to see it as some kind of party trick when he was younger , but it gets extremely painful for him after a while			0
' but then @entity22 ca n’t even make a fist with his hand because his fingers are so stiff			0
' i do n’t think we ’ll ever get to the bottom of what the syndrome is			0
' we ’ve had so many tests now and they ’ve not been able to find a match against any known condition in the world over			1
' doctors have said it is extremely rare for a syndrome like ours to be discovered in this day - and - age			1
' one consultant even said that they could name this condition after the family if future tests are inconclusive			1
' she added : ' it ’s definitely a claim - to - fame , i suppose , but a claim we could live without			0
' the child most affected by the condition is @entity22 and the brave youngster has had a constant string of operations since being born			1
cat said : ' @entity22 was born in june and had his first operation the following january on his pelvis			0
' he even had bone cut of his hip and put into his feet to help him walk - almost like a skin graft with bone - to reconstruct his feet in four places			1
despite the condition affecting every one of their children , parents @entity7 and @entity15 have said that they are able to lead a perfectly normal life the condition predominantly affects the children 's joints and bones , making them stiff and often painful ' he had to be in a wheelchair for approximately nine months after that operation because he ca n’t grip crutches because the joints in his hand are so stiff and he has very little muscle growth			1
' because the disorder also halts tendon growth ( the connective tissue between muscle and bone ) , @entity22 has to have an operation every month to stretch them			0
he will need these operations until he reaches the point when he stops growing			0
but despite this , the brave youngster - who could barely even manage one footstep after the surgery to reconstruct his feet - recently completed a 10 - mile trek in aid of @entity151 in south @entity8 , who performed the operation			0
as a result of the walk @entity22 raised £ 612 for the cause			2
all of the children have suffered the syndrome their entire lives , which often takes the form of their muscles and tissue not growing properly , often requiring painful surgery to correct he said : ' walking is something people do n’t really think about , but for me it ’s been life changing			2
' every penny i make can help other people and go towards finding the next cure and improving someone else ’s life			2
' i ’m getting on fine now , i can do lots more things and it feels excellent			0
' his mother said : ' at his worst , he could n’t walk at all and needed a wheelchair			2
' without the physio he would n’t be able to get out of bed or go to school			0
the family are active members of their local church , and the eight - year - old son , @entity22 , has recently undertaken a charity event where he undertook a 10 - mile trek to raise money for the local children 's hospital ' we have to get up very early , especially when it ’s cold and he needs to warm up at home first			1
' usually they would only operate on one foot at a time , but the condition means @entity22 ca n’t use crutches			1
' once his pots were off he wanted to be walking everywhere straight away , but he had to learn how to do it all again			0
' his walking is much better now			0
' he has become more stable and can take more solid steps			0
at one point , he needed to wear a helmet because he was falling over all the time			0
the disorder affects muscle growth , but also often leads to learning difficulties in later life , as well as other problems like a lack of adult tooth growth ' but he is brilliant with dealing with it all			2
he gives 110 per cent in everything			0
' despite the condition affecting every one of her children , @entity15 describes the family as ' normal and happy '			1
the condition that all the children share is thought to be the only one of its kind , and is rare enough to the point that it might be named after them - although a member of the @entity225 says this is also a rarity @entity15 said : ' you are constantly being presented with new challenges in life and this one is ours			1
' we just get on with things , though			0
we are happy , we are normal and we would not have things any other way			0
' @entity234 , medical director , at @entity235 , said : ' we can not comment on individual cases for reasons of patient confidentiality			0
however , it is important to note that it is no longer normal practice to name syndromes after doctors or families			2
' at the @entity235 we host the @entity246 service			0
' our knowledge of rare genetic conditions , and testing available on a service basis , is improving all the time			0
' however , where a diagnosis still remains unknown , we provide opportunities for families to take part in research studies that we hope will find the cause for their condition			2

all five children in the @entity7 family have condition , but the parents do *n't*
this condition has never been seen before by doctors all around the world
requires the children to have regular surgeries , and walk with crutches
condition affects joints and bones , causing *frequent* digit dislocation
doctors have had to just treat the symptoms rather than finding cause
