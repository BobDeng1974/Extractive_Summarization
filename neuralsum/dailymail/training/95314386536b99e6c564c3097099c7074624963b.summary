it does n't seem that long since @entity2 's capitulation at @entity3 last april signalled the end of @entity6 ' unhappy tenure at @entity2			1
now , as @entity3 prepare to visit @entity8 on sunday , it is perhaps time for @entity10 's new @entity2 team to reveal its true self			1
such has been the scale and speed of change since that awful day on @entity15 less than six months ago that only two players selected by @entity6 at @entity18 - @entity17 , and @entity19 - can expect to start on sunday			1
six members of the 18 , meanwhile , no longer play for the club			0
a club for which stability became a byword during sir @entity35 's years has perhaps not seen a time like it since the great @entity37 himself arrived in the mid- 1980s and began dismantling what he believed had become a glorified social club under @entity41			2
on his arrival this summer , new @entity2 manager @entity10 asked for a little time			2
three months , he said , and , though we are not at that self - imposed deadline yet , it is perhaps time that we began to see a little more of a ' philosophy ' that @entity47 often talks about but has thus far not been convincingly revealed by his team 's football			0
to look at @entity2 's first team these days is to look upon a forward line that can look as though it has been hewn from a fantasy football league			1
they can play like that , too , even if this weekend 's line - up will miss @entity27 through suspension and @entity57 through injury			0
@entity6 shakes hands with his successor at @entity3 , @entity61 prior to the game @entity17 ( left ) and @entity19 ( right ) could be the only two who survive the cut captain @entity27 will miss out after he was sent off against @entity64 on saturday the @entity66 striker is suspended after needlessly hacking down @entity67 @entity10 will have @entity68 at his disposal once again this weekend @entity2 's first game post-transfer window was at home to @entity72			1
initially a game scheduled to feature supporter protests about a lack of spending , @entity2 's late flurry of august spending was ultimately reflected by a 4 - 0 victory featuring cameos from @entity81 and @entity68			1
elsewhere in their squad , though , @entity2 still look paper thin , especially at centre half			2
this has been reflected in a startling 5 - 3 defeat at @entity87 ( that sentence still does n't sound right ) and a 2 - 1 home win over @entity64 that began vibrantly and ended with nerves shredded			0
@entity91 has been drafted in , already a more senior head available at the back			2
' obviously , i want to play in every game and i am trying to impress the manager enough to keep my place in his team , ' he told @entity99			0
' at first , i would have been happy just to gain experience by being in and around the squad			0
' but now that i have played a few games , it is one of those situations when you are hungry for more			0
there is healthy competition among the defenders			0
' @entity81 has made a flying start to life at @entity8 under @entity47 @entity111 is a new signing but must already try to organise a new back line , including @entity91 healthy competition , yes - but the inconsistency remains			1
it 's this contrast between performances that @entity47 has not yet managed to reconcile			0
@entity2 can look a completely different team within the space one match , never mind one week , and the reasons for this go deeper than an injury crisis that will once more find @entity47 scrabbling around for fit defenders at @entity125 today			2
for all the technical quality of @entity2 's offensive players – @entity57 in particular looks a fine footballer – @entity2 continue to have difficulties retaining possession for long periods			1
@entity35 used to talk about suffocating opponents with possession but that trait began to slip away during his later years and it 's problem that went on to afflict @entity135 and is now causing difficulties for @entity47			0
@entity137 and @entity138 will hope to build on their striking partnership against @entity3 @entity57 looks like a fine footballer , but he will miss out this weekend due to a rib injury against @entity64 , for example , @entity2 were already beginning to pedal backwards prior to @entity27 's sending off after an hour			1
a team that can look as devastating as any when it moves forward still spends too much time without the ball , despite the endless passing drills that @entity47 asks his coaches to organise on a daily basis during first ream training			0
perhaps @entity2 's venerable coach will not be able to fix this until another transfer window or two has passed			1
maybe the return of @entity156 will help			0
whatever the case , with @entity3 's visit on sunday followed by games against @entity161 , @entity162 and @entity163 , it would appear that @entity2 's @entity165 season is about to begin in earnest			1
like our @entity2 facebook page .			2

@entity2 face @entity3 this sunday at @entity8
last fixture against @entity61 's side saw @entity6 sacked *shortly* afterwards
@entity17 and @entity19 are the only two from that fixture who can expect to start
@entity2 's stability has been thrown out the window under @entity10
several new signings could start on sunday
@entity111 and @entity91 should partner at the back
inconsistency has *blighted* @entity2 's season ... it starts in earnest now
