thousands of planes are ' flying blind without radar ' when they land at regional airports because @entity4 has refused to comply with safety instructions , aviator and entrepreneur @entity7 has warned			1
the millionaire and former chairman of the @entity10 claimed that lives are being put at risk because the @entity4 has been ' completely irresponsible ' in not implementing a 2004 ministerial safety directive relating to radar at 10 airports			1
@entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity24 and @entity26 airports currently do not use radar for incoming flights			2
' they have to obey the ministerial directive and they have not obeyed it purely so they can make more profits , ' mr @entity7 told @entity35			1
former chairman of the @entity10 @entity7 said profits are being put before safety at regional airports across @entity40 in 2004 a ministerial safety directive told @entity10 to implement radar systems for air traffic controllers at 10 regional airports but ten years later these airports still do not have radar he warned the @entity4 board members that not implementing radar technology means ' they will be personally liable and they will lose their houses ' if an accident occurs			1
the implementation was supposed to have taken one year but has still not been carried out after 10 years			0
mr @entity7 said that although there have not been any accidents because of a lack of radar so far , it is only a matter of time			2
' it has n't caused a crash yet but you do n't have a ministerial safety directive that requires something to be implemented for no reason			1
eventually there will be an accident ... it 's obvious that if you do n't install it that eventually you will have an accident			1
' he explained that the category of air space that the airports use ' requires radar to operate properly '			0
@entity17 is one of the regional airports that was advised to install radar technology in 2004 @entity19 airport , where thousands of tourists fly into every year , was also told to get radar ' it means if you are flying an aircraft it 's on the radar screen			1
but at the moment they are flying blind without radar			0
air traffic control have to call them up and work out where they are and they say " 20 miles " away , ' mr @entity7 said			2
according to 2010 data from the @entity98 thousands of planes fly out of the 10 regional airports every year : implementing radar services at the regional airports would cost tens of millions of dollars and mr @entity7 believes this is the reason why the safety directive has been ignored			1
' they have worked out that if they do n't put the radar in and if they force the industry to put black boxes in instead they would make higher profits			2
' responding to legal advice issued by mr @entity7 to @entity4 in relation to the radars , @entity4 chairman air chief marshal @entity113 , told the @entity117 : ' @entity4 has continued to progress technological and operational changes to enhance the safety of our services in regional @entity40			1
' there are now advanced technologies which in the near Â­ future will , to a large extent , replace radar surveillance			0
' however , mr @entity7 refuted mr @entity113 's claims that the airports are using new safety technology instead of radars			1
' their answer is modern technology will save money but it has n't come in to use yet			0
they are putting profit in front of safety , ' he said			0
in a 2010 report that reassessed the ministerial advice , the @entity98 noted : ' radar is no longer the only technology available to provide surveillance to @entity144			0
the introduction of satellite systems , air - to - ground data links and the emergence of new techniques provide surveillance coverage to @entity144 and will eventually replace the use of radar systems			0
' @entity141 is considered to be old technology and is expensive to install and maintain when compared to newer technologies			0
' the report also noted the high cost of installing radar technology and admitted that : ' the level of radar coverage surrounding the 10 @entity160 has not changed since the @entity161 was given in 2004 although the @entity163 network has improved coverage in @entity165			2
' in 2010 , there were 6,263 @entity168 flights a year from the @entity169			0

entrepreneur @entity7 says 2004 ministerial safety directive which said radars should be installed at 10 regional airports has been ignored
the former chairman of the @entity10 claims profit is being put before safety
implementing radar services at the regional airports would cost tens of millions of dollars
airports without radars include @entity17 and @entity18
' it 's obvious that if you do n't install it that eventually you will have an accident , ' mr @entity7 said
