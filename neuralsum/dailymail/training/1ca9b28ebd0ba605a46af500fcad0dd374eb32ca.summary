saved : the tiny swiftlet was being cared for at a wildlife rehabilitation centre after it had fallen from its nest at just two weeks old carer : hospital manager @entity7 had been feeding the bird using tweezers before she sat it in her hand @entity7 , of @entity15 , said : ' the swiftlet was in a bad state when it was handed in to us			1
' any young swift that falls to the ground is in danger because the birds ca n't take off from the floor			0
' we had to start off feeding it a diet of liquidised crickets before we could move it on to the juicy waxworms			0
' we hope to be able to release the bird in about four weeks when its muscles have been built up and it is ready to fly			0
unusual : the vulnerable chick then opened its mouth wide enough to fit the tip of her thumb in ' swifts are migratory birds and their annual migration to @entity61 usually starts in about eight weeks time so hopefully it 'll be ready in time			1
' the staff at @entity15 hope the swiftlet will have doubled in weight to about 35g once it is ready for release			2
@entity7 added that @entity15 is currently taking more swifts into their care than ever before which she puts down to the spell of hot weather			2
swifts are quite unique as a species in that they eat and sleep while flying and only land to have babies and feed them .			0
