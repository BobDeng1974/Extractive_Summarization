published : 12:58 est , 4 december 2012 updated : 02:51 est , 5 december 2012 worshippers have beaten @entity1 to it and imported their own gift from @entity4 - this flatpack church - just in time for @entity6			1
for the past 90 years , the congregation of @entity8 , in @entity9 , @entity10 , have had to make do with a @entity12 army hut			1
but with the hut falling into a state of disrepair , the @entity14 congregation decided it was time to replace their old church with a brand new £ 560,000 building			2
@entity21 you believe it : the new flatpack @entity8 's and @entity24 , @entity25 , made from 150 - year - old pine from @entity4 , @entity27			1
it took just over three months to assemble outdated : the old @entity29 's and @entity30 , @entity9 , dated back to the @entity12 , held only 70 parishioners and lacked decent insulation a ' @entity33 ' was set up and donors were invited to buy a metre of wood or more , costing a minimum of £ 5			1
and now , thanks to a mammoth three - year fundraising drive and various grants , a brand new church has been built from a flatpack made of 150 - year - old pine logs			1
the @entity10 church was cut to size in @entity27 before being shipped to the @entity46 with the inside of the building finished by a team of up to 15builders , including carpenters , plumbers and electricians			1
the new church boasts a life expectancy of up to 200 years and took just over three months to build			1
it has twice the capacity of the old church and comfortably seats 150 worshippers on new furniture			2
last weekend more than 200 churhgoers packed it out to witness it being sanctified by the @entity64 , the right reverend @entity65			2
mr @entity65 said : ' this is such a lovely building and i think people will rapidly grow to love it and treasure it			0
' those who have been involved in the project already love it			0
' inside : the @entity4 pine used to build the church is particulalry hardy , having endured freezing weather in @entity4			1
the structure is expected to last for 200 years high and mighty : the @entity75 's new capacity is 150 parishioners - double what it was before			1
and it 's better insulated light touch : the stained glass window was designed by churchgoer @entity84			0
it is triple glazed with lead lighting @entity88 vicar , @entity87 , said : ' i am just absolutely over the moon with this beautiful new building			0
' it ’s not very often a congregation gets a lovely new church like this , so we are extremely grateful and pleased to worship here			0
' it was a lovely service , and i would like to thank everyone for coming along to help us celebrate			0
' since pulling the old church down last december and moving into the new one , the congregation celebrated mass in the nearby church hall			0
@entity104 , who supervised the project , said worshippers had reported back to say they felt warm thanks to the good insulation , with quite a few remarking on the incredible smell thanks to the pine wood			2
' our church has always been on the edge of the woods , in the shadow of oak trees so we wanted to build something that was compatible			0
' we are extremely pleased to move into our beautiful new church '			0
handmade : the wooden altar was crafted by @entity121 , the church warden , who counts woodcraft as one of his hobbies			0

the 150 - year - old @entity4 wood is expected to last up to 200 years
@entity128 took just over three months thanks to team of up to 15 builders
