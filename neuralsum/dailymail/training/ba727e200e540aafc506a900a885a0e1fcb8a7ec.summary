by @entity0 published : 15:47 est , 17 april 2013 updated : 15:53 est , 17 april 2013 the @entity2 administration is not allocating any significant resources to prevent fertilizer bombing attacks like the one that toppled the @entity7 in @entity8 in 1995 , a former senior @entity9 official with direct knowledge of the department 's budgeting and operations told @entity14			1
in a lengthy interview , the former official said the april 15 @entity17 ' tragic ' , adding ' but if this were an @entity8 - type bomb , there would have been hundreds of deaths			1
' @entity9 has just one federal employee and no contractors devoted to the task of preventing the deployment and detonation of ammonium nitrate bombs , a situation he called ' completely ineffective , and very dangerous for the country			1
like the @entity41 attacks , it occurred on @entity42			0
unlike @entity44 , the bomb was composed of ammonium nitrate and combustible fuel ' if this were an @entity8 - type bomb , there would have been hundreds of deaths ' in @entity44 , said a former @entity9 official			1
@entity51 ( r ) was executed for his part in the 1995 bombing			0
@entity54 ( @entity55 ) got life in prison without the possibility of parole the source , who spoke on condition of anonymity , was a political appointee at @entity9 headquarters			2
he described the @entity65 ' chemical security program as ' disastrous , ' and also criticized the decimation of formerly robust grant programs intended to help states and cities prevent attacks like the one in @entity44			1
two bombs were detonated near the finish line of monday 's @entity41 , killing three people and wounding at least 173 others			0
@entity75 , a former homeland security assistant secretary for infrastructure protection , told mailonline tuesday that ' the @entity2 administration has continued to cut the budget for offices such as the @entity81 from $ 20 million started under [ @entity82 ] @entity82 , to $ 11 million today			1
' @entity14 did not interview @entity75 for this story			0
but the source did say that @entity9 now has just a single federal employee and no contractors assigned to prevent the construction , deployment and detonation of ammonium nitrate bombs like the one @entity51 and @entity54 used in @entity8			1
that situation , he said , is ' completely ineffective and very dangerous for the country , ' adding in an email that cuts to the @entity94 are ' the tip of the iceberg			0
' ammonium nitrate is sold by farming supply retailers , and comes in bags like this one ( @entity55 ) , which contains about 1,300 pounds			1
in 2010 , @entity65 and @entity100 disposed of a large cache of the chemical in @entity103 , @entity104 in 2010			0
the blast could reportedly be felt at a distance of 5 miles ammonium nitrate is a chemical most commonly found in commercial farming fertilizer			1
@entity110 has published how - to guides for the construction of bombs using the chemical and diesel fuel			2
in 2006 @entity116 was able to buy a half - ton of the fertilizer for less than $ 300 , without photo ids , and move it to a warehouse a few miles away from the @entity121			2
' a thousand pounds would take down a good - sized building , ' @entity116 's @entity122 reported			2
the @entity8 bomb contained about two tons of fertilizer and $ 3,000 worth of racing fuel			2
it killed 168 people including 19 children			0
terrorists worldwide , including those in @entity132 , @entity133 , @entity134 , @entity135 , @entity136 , @entity137 , @entity104 and @entity138 , have used ammonium nitrate because it 's stable , providing little risk that they will be killed in accidental explosions			1
it 's also inexpensive and very effective			0
a 2010 documentary on the @entity147 network included a test explosion involving two tons of the chemical loaded into a truck and detonated from a safe distance			0
the images were chilling and devastating			0
the @entity9 's website includes a page for the @entity155 , listing public meetings hosted by the agency to discuss regulations governing the program			2
the last one occurred in november 2011			0
another program @entity9 has ' zeroed out ' according to the source who spoke with @entity14 , is the @entity163			0
that initiative was a $ 50 million grant program that awarded local law enforcement and first responders with funds to ' identify and mitigate vulnerabilities at the highest - risk critical infrastructure sites , ' according to @entity9			2
a @entity9 spokesman did not respond to questions about whether the ammonium nitrate and buffer zone programs were still funded or operational			1
but an internet link on the program 's web page , which once led to a @entity179 website , is no longer functioning			2
a @entity121 spokesman also did not respond to an email seeking comment			0
a former senior @entity9 official faulted the @entity2 administration for not doing enough to prevent future ammonium nitrate bomb attacks like the one that leveled the @entity7 building			1
secretary @entity189 ( @entity55 ) told @entity190 on wednesday that the @entity44 bombings did not appear to be part of a larger terrorist plot another program about which @entity9 would not answer questions is the @entity197 initiative			1
police chiefs , the former official said , are under enormous pressure to fund their own infrastructure protection plans because @entity9 is gradually taking back hundreds of millions in grant funds that used to be available			0
overall , the source said , $ 3.5 billion in grants to state and local law enforcement were available when president @entity2 took office , funds that @entity9 grants for the specific purpose of protecting buildings , roadways , train stations , airports , power plants , reservoirs , urban buildings and other sites from from attack			0
there are , he estimated , ' hundreds of millions of dollars ' less available today			0
the @entity223 and the @entity224 and @entity225 - once a $ 25 - 30 million program - have also seen their funding eliminated , he said , adding that ' major urban areas like @entity44 are why we created these offices , and they 've been degraded to the point of literal nonexistence			1
' infrastructure protection , the former official added , is an undersecretary - level position , but it 's been turned into a ' backwater ' under the @entity2 administration , because the @entity121 has not taken its function seriously since 2009 .			1

a former high - level homeland security appointee says ammonium nitrate bomb prevention program now *consists* of just one employee
if @entity44 ' were an @entity8 - type bomb , there would have been hundreds of deaths , ' he said
the @entity223 , created in the *aftermath* of 9/11 , is also no longer funded under secretary @entity189
