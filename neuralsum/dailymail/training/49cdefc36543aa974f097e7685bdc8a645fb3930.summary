radio 4 presenter @entity0 said the @entity1 ignored mass immigration for fears it would be considered racist one of the @entity1 ’s top presenters has admitted that the corporation ignored mass immigration because it feared critics would say it was racist			1
@entity9 ’s today interviewer @entity0 accused his employer of being ‘ soft ’ , ‘ complacent ’ and ‘ institutionally nervous ’ when it came to tackling the story or questioning multiculturalism			2
and he said that @entity1 employees are unable to understand the concerns of ordinary people because they typically lead ‘ sheltered ’ middle - class lives and are overwhelmingly ‘ liberal @entity19 males ’			1
the criticism , which is the latest in a string of admissions of left - wing bias by senior @entity1 figures , comes weeks after the government accused the today programme of misrepresenting its spending cuts			2
@entity28 hit out at a one of its reports , which said his reforms were ‘ utterly terrifying ’			0
the chancellor said the @entity1 coverage was ‘ nonsense ’ and had been ‘ hyperbolic ’			2
now @entity0 , 71 , has told the @entity35 that the corporation is facing an ‘ existential crisis greater than it ’s ever been ’ because ‘ people , serious , thoughtful people , talk seriously and thoughtfully about the future of the @entity1 in a way that they have n’t before ’			1
the veteran presenter admitted that the last @entity43 government ’s controversial immigration policy was not sufficiently ‘ interrogated ’ by the @entity1 , saying : ‘ the @entity43 government underestimated by a factor of ten the number of people who were going to move from @entity49			1
’ he said the @entity1 was ‘ frightened of appearing racist ’ , adding : ‘ we were too institutionally nervous of saying , is n’t immigration getting a little bit out of hand ? and can we be critical of multiculturalism ? ‘ we did n’t interrogate immigration rigorously enough			1
we failed to look at what our job was			0
’ @entity0 claimed he was partly responsible for the @entity1 ’s ‘ complacent ’ approach towards immigration , because he failed to challenge @entity43 ’s decision to allow migrants from @entity49 and @entity60 to work in @entity61 from 2004 , and the flawed prediction that only 13,000 would arrive			1
after more than a million @entity66 immigrants moved to the @entity61 , senior @entity43 figures eventually admitted the policy had been a huge mistake			2
@entity0 said : ‘ i do remember , vaguely , interviews with ministers at the time and saying , “ are you sure that ’s all there ’ll be ? ” and when they said “ yeah ” , accepting it			1
’ he said @entity1 employees are unable to understand the concerns of ordinary people because they typically have ‘ sheltered ’ middle - class lives and are overwhelmingly ‘ liberal @entity19 males ’ the star went on to say that too many @entity1 staff were ‘ arrogant ’ and thought they knew ‘ what was best for the country ’			1
he added : ‘ it was and still is relentlessly middle class			0
there was a predominant voice – the liberal @entity19 male			0
’ @entity91 mp @entity90 , who sits on the @entity92 , said : ‘ this is a refreshing outbreak of candour , honesty and rare insight from one of the big beasts of the @entity1			2
their bias has gone unchallenged for too long			0
’ @entity0 is not the first senior @entity1 figure to criticise the corporation ’s failure to challenge left - wing assumptions			1
this year former @entity106 host @entity105 accused the @entity1 of being ‘ smug ’			0
he has also said its coverage of climate change ‘ abandoned the pretence of impartiality long ago ’			0
last year the @entity1 ’s former head of tv news , @entity111 , criticised the corporation for shutting out critics of the @entity115 , saying : ‘ on the @entity1 ’s own admission , it did not give enough space to anti-immigration views or eu - withdrawalists			1
’ and another senior executive , current radio chief @entity120 , claimed the @entity1 had a ‘ deep liberal bias ’ when she became head of news in 2004			2
a @entity1 spokesman said : ‘ @entity0 was merely echoing other senior @entity1 figures who have acknowledged that we were slow to reflect changing opinions on immigration			1
this was a historical issue and we now believe our reporting is in the right place and we cover this complex issue in depth			0
’ sir @entity136 says the @entity1 has far more bureaucrats than it did during his time at the corporation and that programmes have suffered as a result			2
speaking to the @entity144 newspaper , he said : ' i was very lucky that when i was there it was run by programme makers ... they were either very good journalists or very good at showbusiness			0
' now it seems to me there are more bureaucrats than anything else			0
it shows in the broadcasting			0
' the veteran presenter said that when he was with the @entity1 he was able to talk ideas over with bosses while having a drink , but added that times have changed			1
' nowadays it would take about three years to circumnavigate the varous committees it would have to pass through before it passed under his nose , ' he said			0
' but i ’m a @entity1 man through and through and think it ’s the greatest broadcasting system throughout the world			0

@entity0 says @entity1 ignored critical stories about mass immigration
