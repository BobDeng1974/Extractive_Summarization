whether it ’s plain vanilla or something more exotic , when ice cream is frozen solid it ’s almost impossible to scoop from the tub			1
now an inventor says he ’s created a device to solve the problem , and it ’s all to do with the angle at which you approach the task			0
rather than scooping with your wrist in a sideways motion , @entity12 suggests pushing the scoop away from you , bringing the power of your arm and chest muscles into play			2
@entity12 , 35 , invented the new scoop design after becoming frustrated at not being able get ice cream out the tub when the dessert was frozen solid the ' @entity28 ' design changes the way people scoop ice cream when it is frozen solid his midnight scoop – said to be the first change in design since the ice cream scoop was invented by @entity36 in 1897 – has a curved handle which allows you to channel those forces			1
aerospace engineer mr @entity12 , a 35 - year - old father of two from @entity41 in the @entity42 , said : ‘ every time i scooped ice cream i could n’t help but feel there was a better way			1
i like my ice cream frozen and hard – melting it with a hot spoon or letting it sit out for half an hour ruins it			2
’ it has taken nearly two years for the scoop to come to fruition			0
made from a coated and forged aluminium alloy , it will cost £ 30			0
mr @entity12 said : ‘ it ’s called the @entity28 because i spent so many late nights drafting and designing on the drawing board			2
‘ i designed the scoop to rely on something that never runs out – mechanical force supplied by the arm and chest			0
my background in aerospace engineering has made me familiar with mechanical forces			0
but more importantly i am a father , and that has made me familiar with ice cream ! ’ ' i decided i needed to come up with a simple way to scoop hard ice cream without melting it , and without creating some overly - complex product that would break eventually			1
' made from a coated and forged 6061 aluminum alloy , they will be sold for a little over £ 30 once the @entity77 crowdfunding campaign ends in october			0
rather than spooning ice cream with your wrist in a side - on motion , @entity12 suggests pushing it chest - on so you can use their arm and chest muscles the scoop has a curved handle which gives extra force and means there is no need to use your wrist mr @entity12 , an aerospace and mechanical engineer from @entity96 , @entity41 , said : ' the most common ice cream scoopers today are ones that someone designed decades ago and went ' good enough '			1
' since then , they have n't changed and that 's not good enough for me			0
' i used some innovation to fundamentally change the way ice cream is scooped			0
' the idea went through 38 official redesigns			0
i just wanted to make sure i had the design right , that it worked the way it was supposed to , and that it would last as long as possible			0
' i designed the @entity28 to rely on something that never runs out - mechanical force supplied by the arm and chest			1
' the curved handle - as it is symmetrical - also allows for complete ambidextrous use			1
' it 's actually called the @entity28 because i spent so many late nights drafting and designing on the drawing board - usually after midnight			0
mr @entity12 said that he needed a fast and efficient way to get ice cream out of the tub for his son and daughter ' all in all , it 's been roughly two to three years since the original idea came to me			1
' everyone that has tried it - from family to ice cream parlours - has wanted to keep our scoop			1
' my background in aerospace engineering has made me familiar with mechanical forces and the materials the @entity28 is made from			0
' but more importantly - i am a father , and that has made me familiar with ice cream			2
' that was part of what drove me to create the @entity28 - i needed a fast and efficient way to get ice cream to my son and daughter			1
' also , the scoop allows them to scoop ice cream a lot easier			2
it 's a win win ! ' thje new design has taken two years and 38 redesigns to come to fruition , 117 years after the first ice cream scoop was first invented by @entity157 in 1897			1

@entity12 's ' @entity28 ' changes the way people serve ice cream
curved handle gives extra force and allows scooper to push chest - on
taken 38 redesigns to come to fruition - 117 years after first scoop invented
@entity12 said he needed efficient way to scoop dessert for son and daughter
