by @entity1 reporter @entity2 is set to add to @entity5 's @entity4 traffic woes as thousands of @entity6 squeeze into @entity8 lanes to worship at the many mosques that surround the @entity10			1
every year during the month of august , vast crowds of worshippers descend on east @entity5 - one of the most concentrated @entity6 communities in the country - for nightly prayer			2
local councillor @entity16 said the influx of people to the area , between central @entity5 and @entity20 , will play havoc with @entity23 road links and traffic hotpsots			1
the district surrounding the @entity10 is home to more than 250,000 @entity6 and almost 100 mosques			1
prayers in @entity29 : every year during the month of august , vast crowds of worshippers descend on east @entity5 , which has one of the most concentrated @entity6 communities in the country the borough 's biggest , the @entity33 , in @entity34 , draws over 5,000 congregants during @entity2			1
' the areas all around the mosques get very busy around prayer time during @entity2 , and there is often traffic chaos on nearby roads and it will be busier on the @entity45 , ' councillor @entity16 told @entity46			1
warning : local councillor @entity16 said large crowds traveling to the area between central @entity5 and @entity20 for nightly worship will play havoc with @entity4 road links and traffic hotpsots he added : ' although the prayers are in the late evening , many people will stay on at the @entity10 after events and will be traveling through @entity5 late in the day and might not be expecting it to be congested , which is a big concern			1
' it is the first time @entity2 has fallen on an @entity23 since @entity59			1
during the religious festival , which started at 3.17am today , @entity6 are expected to go without food and drink from dawn until dusk for 30 days			0
there are some 3,000 @entity6 athletes competing in the @entity23 , although most have been given special dispensation by religious leaders to waive the obligation while taking part			1
meanwhile , @entity70 were warned today to expect the capital ’s roads to ' look and feel different ' from monday as work on @entity4 - only traffic lanes nears completion			1
the 30 miles of @entity76 , which will accommodate 1,300 vehicles an hour carrying athletes , officials and @entity80 , will be in operation from wednesday			0
road marking for the @entity83 - which run alongside existing lanes - and alterations to 1,300 sets of traffic lights has already begun			1
tonight the final stage of work on the @entity83 , involving 2,000 contractors , will start and continue for five nights			2
work includes erection of three temporary pedestrian footbridges at @entity95 , and installation of barriers for restricted turns			0
the first @entity99 - on the @entity100 in west @entity5 - came into operation on monday			1
drivers will be able to use the other @entity76 until they become active on wednesday			0
the @entity83 form part of a 109 - mile @entity104 ( @entity104 ) in @entity5 and will generally operate between 6am and midnight			0
ready ? @entity5 motorists are preparing for chaos on the roads of the capital after confusion already struck last week confusion : it was unclear when exactly the @entity4 lanes came into force drivers who illegally use the @entity83 or stop along the route face a penalty charge of £ 130 , while illegally parked vehicles will be impounded and could incur a release fee of £ 200			1
earlier this week , @entity120 hurdler @entity119 tweeted that his bus journey from @entity122 to the @entity123 in @entity20 , east @entity5 , had taken four hours and that this had not offered him a good first impression of @entity5			0
@entity5 mayor @entity126 said afterwards that it was thought this particular journey actually took two and a half hours			0
he added that it was hoped to get transfer times to @entity20 down to as little as one hour			0
@entity132 ( @entity132 ) said : ' the works ( being carried out ) will progressively change @entity5 ’s road network so that , by monday morning , @entity5 ’s road network will look and feel different			2
' restrictions : the @entity137 takes traffic from the @entity100 , where a @entity99 runs for three and a half miles between junctions three and two on the @entity5 - bound carriageway @entity142 , @entity132 ’s surface transport managing director , said : ' our advice to road users is clear - do n’t get caught out			2
avoid driving in central @entity5 , around the @entity104 and @entity23 venues			2
' last week the @entity4 lane opened and caused widespread confusion on the road			2
motorists were unsure whether they were allowed in the newly opened lane , and many cut in at the last minute before the lane began causing panic amongst the other drivers			0
athletes who had recently arrived in the country took to @entity159 to vent their fury over the confusing new road markings			0
@entity120 400m hurdler @entity119 expressed his frustration when he tweeted : ' um , so we ’ve been lost on the road for four hours ’ ‘ not a good first impression , @entity5			0
’ bizarre : motorists travelling along @entity167 in central @entity5 face just two options - and both are illegal			0
they can either travel in the bus lane , the @entity4 lane or on the wrong side of the road odd : this picture shows another view of the confusing road			2
motorists caught travelling in either a bus lane or @entity4 lane during operational hours face a £ 130 fine the confusion somehow increased further when it emerged that one of the @entity4 lanes in central @entity5 meets a bus lane - and there is no road between the two for other motorists			1
dubbed ' the road to nowhere ' , @entity167 seems impossible for motorists to navigate down without incurring a heavy fine			0
londoners and visitors can expect more confusion akin to this come monday as the @entity23 approaches and have been advised to avoid busy areas both on the roads and on public transport links on both the underground and on buses throughout			1
yellow route : roads on this route will have a dedicated ' @entity4 - only ' lane for athletes , officials , vips , sponsors and media			1
the lanes will be in force from 6am until midnight			0
red route : roads on this route , the busiest " core section " of the vip network , will be affected by major restrictions to speed up traffic but will be fully open to the public			2
measures could include bans on parking and right - turns , suspension of pedestrian crossings , phasing of traffic lights and no public entry from side roads			1
blue route : roads on this route will only be affected on competition days			0
they will run from the athletes ' accommodation to venues such as @entity235 , @entity236 and @entity237			0
