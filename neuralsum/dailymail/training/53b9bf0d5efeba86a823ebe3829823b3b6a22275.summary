stand by for 360 minutes of festive football action which could define the season			2
title - chasers @entity2 and @entity4 will be wanting to put more distance between themselves and the pack while @entity7 continue to snap away at their heels			1
@entity9 have some ground to make up and there is also the intriguing question of whether @entity13 and @entity14 can sustain their surprise challenge			1
@entity16 tends to sort out the men from the boys , after all			1
four games , 13 days			0
while the nation sits on its collective backside , gorging , can the @entity20 provide a feast of another kind ? here are @entity27 ’s predictions - eat your heart out @entity30			1
@entity31 ( left ) and @entity32 will be taking their sides through a hectic festive period @entity34 will be looking to reduce the three - point deficit to @entity20 leaders @entity2 @entity36 : saturday , december 20 - monday december 22 saturday december 20 @entity4 vs @entity37 ( 12.45pm kick - off , @entity39 1 ) sunday december 21 @entity40 vs @entity41 ( 1.30pm kick - off , @entity43 1 ) @entity44 vs @entity9 ( 4pm kick - off , @entity46 ) monday december 22 @entity47 vs @entity2 ( 8pm kick - off , @entity46 ) it is the weekend before @entity16 and legs will still be relatively fresh			1
@entity4 arguably have the ‘ easiest ’ matches - @entity37 , @entity51 , @entity52 and @entity41 - but they must first overcome the challenge of having no fit striker			1
the round of games kick off with @entity4 vs @entity37 on saturday lunchtime			1
@entity57 and his 14 goals will be missing , as will fellow forwards @entity60 and @entity61			0
maybe @entity62 could do a job there , after all he has scored goals already			0
@entity37 , two successive draws behind them , will be relying on the wizardry of @entity68 before he departs on @entity70 duty , but it is hard to see anything but a @entity4 win			1
@entity57 will not feature for @entity4 during the busy @entity16 period due to injury @entity62 will be expected to continue to take some of the goalscoring burden for @entity4 saturday afternoon looms in importance for @entity14 , who have lost five matches in a row , including the @entity81 quarter - final against @entity83 @entity82			1
@entity85 ’s team last won at the start of november ( 2 - 0 against @entity87 ) and next up are @entity88 , whose form has been flaky			0
@entity13 have been ticking along very nicely recently with three wins and a draw while @entity87 have to go back to september for their last victory			2
@entity94 ’s team will do well to come away with anything , especially if @entity96 is in the mood , not to mention @entity98			0
@entity13 forward @entity98 ( left ) will be key to their chances of maintaining their form then there is @entity7 , who boast an extraordinary record against @entity105			1
the last time @entity105 beat @entity7 at home in the league was the opening day of the 1995 - 96 season			2
in the last five matches against @entity32 ’s team , @entity105 have conceded 17 goals			0
expect them to put up the shutters , batten down the hatches and double - bolt the front door , which could be a tester for in - form skipper @entity118			0
@entity7 captain @entity118 will look to fire his side to victory against @entity105 @entity9 , pilloried a fortnight ago after losing at @entity47 , go to old foes @entity44			1
revenge will be on @entity124 ’s mind after last season ’s 5 - 1 thrashing at @entity127 and two successive four - goal hauls ( @entity129 and @entity40 ) will fuel optimism			0
@entity131 ’s double against @entity40 suggests he is getting better every game , too			0
and finally @entity2 , who head to the @entity134 on monday night			2
@entity31 ’s team will be up for a cold night in the @entity136 and they will be trying to forget last year ’s 3 - 2 shock defeat			0
@entity47 have conceded 10 goals at home in five games - @entity141 and @entity142 could have a field day			0
@entity131 ( left ) celebrates scoring against @entity40 - he will look to keep hitting the net @entity141 must return to the lethal form he showed earlier this season if @entity2 are to succeed @entity4 2 - 0 @entity37 @entity105 0 - 2 @entity7 @entity14 1 - 1 @entity88 @entity13 2 - 1 @entity87 @entity44 1 - 2 @entity9 @entity47 1 - 1 @entity2 @entity147 and all the trimmings : @entity149 ( friday december 26 ) @entity149 ( friday december 26 ) @entity2 vs @entity13 ( 12.45pm kick - off , @entity43 1 ) @entity7 vs @entity40 ( 3.00pm kick - off , @entity39 1 ) @entity9 vs @entity152 ( 5.30pm kick - off , @entity39 1 ) the perfect way to recover from the gluttony of @entity16 - a @entity157 derby between @entity2 and @entity13 at lunchtime on @entity149			1
this is the time of year when injuries and rotation play an important part and @entity31 could well make the point his players have had 48 hours less to recover than the @entity13			2
@entity13 drew 0 - 0 at @entity165 last season but have not scored there in their previous three @entity20 visits			1
@entity85 gets his first taste of no - winter - break action when he takes @entity14 to @entity37			2
he will have the next fixtures against @entity2 and @entity9 in the back of his mind so will that mean resting players ? probably not , having lost to @entity52 last week			1
he needs points and goals from @entity176 ( one in eight games )			0
@entity37 will hope to have @entity178 fit again			0
@entity176 must start finding the back of the net again if @entity14 are to stay in the top six @entity37 's @entity181 ( right ) evades the challenge of @entity47 's @entity183 @entity7 are at home to @entity40 where @entity118 , seven - goal @entity185 and five - goal @entity187 may expect to make the most out of @entity190 ’s goalkeeper worries			1
united fans will remember too well that they lost this fixture 1 - 0 last season			0
relegation - fighting @entity51 face @entity4 and will regard a point as a massive achievement , especially if they beat @entity152 on saturday			2
expect @entity34 to rotate and to win			0
@entity152 , meanwhile , have the job of putting a spoke in @entity9 ’s wheel in the late afternoon kick - off			2
@entity185 has netted seven goals this season and will look to add to that against @entity40 @entity190 is facing a goalkeeper crisis and will have to continue to play 21 - year - old @entity205 @entity2 1 - 0 @entity13 @entity37 0 - 0 @entity14 @entity7 3 - 1 @entity40 @entity51 1 - 3 @entity4 @entity9 2 - 1 @entity152 @entity16 leftovers : sunday december 28 - monday 29 sunday december 28 @entity207 vs @entity7 ( 12.00pm kick - off , @entity39 1 ) @entity14 vs @entity2 ( 2.05pm kick - off , @entity43 1 ) @entity40 vs @entity88 ( 4.15pm kick - off , @entity43 1 ) monday december 29 @entity44 vs @entity211 ( 8.00pm kick - off , @entity43 1 ) barely 48 hours after turning out on @entity149 , weary bodies will need to be dragged out of bed for another round of matches			1
with fatigue settling in , mistakes are more likely , not to mention injuries			0
midday kick - off sees @entity221 take @entity7 to @entity222			2
working on the basis that @entity207 will have gained a few points from the fixtures against @entity52 and @entity87 , @entity227 ’s side could easily have built up a head of steam for this @entity230 importantly for stats watchers , @entity207 have not lost to @entity7 in their last four @entity20 meetings			1
@entity2 head to the south coast where @entity14 currently hold the record of joint meanest defence in the @entity20 with , er , @entity2			1
can @entity237 and @entity207 beat @entity7 at @entity222 over @entity16 ? @entity2 's defence , including captain @entity239 , is the joint - meanest in the league alongside @entity14 both have conceded just 13 so far , which would suggest a goalless draw , except that the @entity14 ’ recent poor run has included losing to @entity7 , @entity4 and @entity9			1
city take on the ginger @entity31 - @entity248 - and @entity52 will be up for this one			0
whether or not @entity249 will get a look - in is another matter entirely			0
then there is another @entity157 derby with the @entity13 hosting @entity9			1
on paper this could be a cracker			0
@entity249 ( centre ) will hope to upset the odds and lead @entity52 to an unlikely win over @entity4 @entity259 could be the star attraction in the mouthwatering clash between @entity9 and @entity13 @entity207 1 - 1 @entity7 @entity14 1 - 1 @entity2 @entity4 3 - 0 @entity52 @entity13 2 - 2 @entity9 @entity262 time : @entity263 ( thursday january 1 ) @entity263 ( thursday january 1 ) @entity47 vs @entity7 ( 12.45pm kick - off , @entity43 1 ) @entity4 vs @entity41 ( 3.00pm kick - off , @entity39 1 ) @entity207 vs @entity2 ( 5.30pm kick - off , @entity39 1 ) clear heads will be the order of the day on what is another annual quirk of the match list			1
just a month after these teams met , it is time for the reverse fixture , which means grudges can still be held and revenge may be a motivating factor			0
@entity277 and @entity187 scored the goals for @entity7 in their 2 - 1 win at @entity280 at the start of december but @entity47 have a habit of rising to the occasion at the @entity134			2
this will be a tricky lunchtime match on @entity263			0
@entity187 has already netted against @entity47 this season and he will look to do so again @entity287 and the rest of the @entity290 side will host @entity7 confident they can get a result , though the same could be said for @entity2 , who will hope to feed off the recent 3 - 0 win against @entity207			1
goals from @entity142 , @entity295 and @entity296 made it miserable for @entity207 and could make it miserable again for them in the tea - time kick - off			0
@entity85 felt robbed at the last - minute @entity259 winner which gave @entity9 victory over @entity14 at the @entity302 but it is another mammoth ask for his players after the @entity2 game on december 28			1
unfinished business might be the order of the day for @entity51 too , as they travel to @entity310			0
@entity13 won 2 - 1 at @entity311 at the start of the month , thanks to goals from @entity315 and @entity316			2
it was a match where @entity51 bossed possession but showed their lack of a cutting edge			0
expectations could be the @entity13 ’ undoing			2
@entity142 ( right ) takes on @entity324 's @entity323 for @entity2 in the @entity81 @entity325 ( left ) has been a key part of @entity13 's impressive defence so far this season @entity47 2 - 2 @entity7 @entity4 3 - 0 @entity41 @entity14 1 - 0 @entity9 @entity13 0 - 0 @entity51 @entity207 2 - 3 @entity2			1

there are four rounds of @entity20 fixtures over festive period
@entity2 and @entity4 will hope to keep @entity7 at bay
@entity9 , @entity13 and @entity14 are all trying to stay in touch
here , @entity27 predicts how the matches will *pan* out over @entity16
