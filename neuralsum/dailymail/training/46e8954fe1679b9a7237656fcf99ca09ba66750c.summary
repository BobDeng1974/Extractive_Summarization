@entity1 rebel fighters have been pictured eagerly unpacking @entity3 - made surface - to - air missile launchers understood to have been smuggled into the country by @entity6 arms dealers			1
taken in a remote area north of the city of @entity10 , the photographs show fighters from the @entity12 assembling @entity14 anti-aircraft missile launchers for use against soldiers loyal to the @entity18 regime			1
the @entity3 - made weapons are thought to have been provided to the @entity12 by sympathisers in @entity21 , who are likely to have purchased them from dealers with links to corrupt officials in the @entity28 government , before having them smuggled into @entity1 through @entity30			1
weapons : fighters from the @entity12 eagerly assemble an @entity14 anti-aircraft missile launcher for use against soldiers loyal to the @entity18 regime power : the @entity3 - made weapons are thought to have been provided to the @entity12 by sympathisers in @entity21 the exact source of this particular batch of @entity3 - made weapons is not immediately clear , although only a handful of nations possess the @entity14 - most of them in @entity41			1
@entity28 is known to have purchased a large number of fn - 6s from @entity3 and - despite international arms embargoes and the government 's strong relations with @entity18 's allies in @entity48 - many of them appear to have ended up the hands of the @entity12			0
last year the @entity51 tracked a @entity28 shipment of @entity3 - made anti-aircraft missiles and newly manufactured small - arms cartridges to rebel fighters in @entity1			2
the weapons are likely to have been sold directly to @entity28 by weapons manufacturers in @entity3			0
@entity14 - 6 missiles were displayed at @entity28 's @entity60 military parade of 2007			0
once in @entity28 , the weapons can fall into the hands of either corrupt officials or local warlords , who offer them for sale on the international black market , where wealthy @entity21 , @entity67 and @entity68 who oppose @entity18 's regime can purchase them and have them shipped directly to rebel groups			2
unboxing : the exact source of this particular batch of @entity3 - made weapons is not immediately clear , although only a handful of nations possess the @entity14 - 6 - most of them in @entity41 arms : free @entity12 sympathisers in @entity21 are likely to have purchased the weapons from dealers with links to corrupt officials in the @entity28 government , before having them smuggled into @entity1 through @entity30 it is highly unlikely the @entity12 would have purchased the surface - to - air missile launchers directly from @entity3 , who along with @entity48 and @entity85 maintain good relations with the @entity18 regime			1
nor is it feasible that the rebels acquired the weapons in their usual method - from regime soldiers that have either abandoned their posts or defected to the @entity12			0
the @entity1 regime has no record of using the @entity14 , although it does hold approximately 4,235 surface to air missile launchers from different manufacturers			2
specially designed to engage low flying targets , the @entity14 is considered @entity3 's most sophisticated surface to air missile launcher to date			0
using digital infrared technology , the @entity14 has a range of 3.7 miles and can lock on to and take out aircraft flying at an altitude of up to 2.1 miles .			0

images show @entity12 assembling surface - to - air missile launchers
@entity3 made weapons likely to have made their way into @entity1 via @entity28
free @entity12 sympathisers in @entity21 buy weapons from corrupt officials
dealers then have weapons carried into @entity1 via @entity30 smuggling routes
