by @entity0 last updated at 5:03 pm on 24th november 2011 lecture : @entity2 will accuse banks of discriminating against customers from a minority background @entity2 will today warn that hundreds more young black men are in jail than at top universities , in an explosive attack on race relations in @entity11			1
the deputy prime minister will also use his speech in @entity14 , @entity15 , to accuse the banking sector and the sports industry of discrimination			0
there are 400 more young black @entity11 men in prison than young black students at the elite @entity23 of universities , he will say			1
@entity11 has ' come a long way ' , he will concede , but it is now up to businesses and industries to support talented people from ethnic minority backgrounds			1
mr @entity2 will say that no matter how many new laws are put on the statute book , what happens at home has a ‘ huge influence ’ on how children do			0
he will say : ‘ in any family , black , white , rich , poor , we need parents and relatives to support their children , helping with homework , keeping them in school			1
’ mr @entity2 will also criticise football 's elite , pointing out that there are no black managers in the @entity48 and just two in the top four divisions , though a quarter of players are black			1
in an onslaught on @entity54 banks , he will point to evidence suggesting that firms owned by black people are four times more likely than those owned by whites to be turned down for loans			1
even if they they can get credit , he will say , black @entity68 , black @entity64 , @entity65 and @entity67 - owned firms have also been subject to higher interest rates than white and @entity71 - run enterprises			1
aides insisted , however , that he was not accusing banks of institutional racism , and admitted current evidence was limited and that the reasons for ethnic minority customers having less access to credit were likely to be complex			1
mr @entity2 will announce that he is asking race equalities minister @entity80 to examine the ‘ barriers preventing black and ethnic minority groups from accessing loans ’ , working with the @entity84 and the government ’s ethnic minority advisory group			1
probe : equalities minister @entity80 will be asked to examine barriers preventing people from ethnic minority backgrounds accessing loans giving the annual @entity92 in @entity14 , the scene of race riots in 1981 , mr @entity2 will attack @entity96 ’s approach to race equality as ‘ too narrow ’			1
he will say : ‘ they attempted to deliver equality solely through the state			0
the state has been used to hide the sins of the market – and the veil is now being lifted			0
’ mr @entity2 , who will admit that he leads a party that is ‘ still too male and too pale ’ , will say that among current business leaders , there are some ‘ hugely important ’ ethnic minority figures – but not enough			1
‘ why is it that members of some of our ethnic communities want to start their own businesses , but their success does n’t match their ambitions ? ’ he will ask			2
we know , for example , that 35 per cent of individuals from black @entity68 origin say they want to start a business , but only six per cent actually do			2
‘ past evidence shows that firms owned by individuals of black @entity68 origin have been four times more likely than so - called “ white firms ” to be denied loans outright			2
and that @entity65 , @entity67 , black @entity64 and black @entity68 - owned businesses have been subject to higher interest rates than @entity130 and @entity71 - owned enterprises			2
‘ the reasons will be complicated : a mix of poorer education among ethnic minority groups , perhaps a lack of the right guidance , a lack of their own capital to invest			2
there may be an element of self - exclusion too			0
address : @entity2 will deliver the annual @entity92 lecture in @entity14 where race riots happened in 1981 ‘ but if we are serious about turning the @entity11 into an island of entrepreneurs , we need to get to the bottom of this			0
are our banks doing enough ? ‘ @entity11 ’s banks , bailed out by the @entity11 people , have just as much responsibility as everyone else , arguably more responsibility , to help @entity11 build a strong and dynamic economy			2
unleashing black and ethnic minority talent is their duty too			1
' we urgently need to lift a lid on the injustices hard - wired into our economy			0
it simply can not be right that we still live in a society where if you are from an ethnic minority , you are much more likely to be poor			0
' the research highlighted by mr @entity2 was published in the @entity168 , and involved more than 3,000 @entity11 firms			0
@entity171 , of the @entity170 , said : ‘ @entity11 banks wish to support all our customers			0
we take racism very seriously and many already have diversity and inclusion policies , with trained staff in place to help			0
bank mentors are already working with the @entity181			0

ethnic minorities are discriminated against by @entity54 banks , he claims
he points out there are no black managers in football 's @entity48
