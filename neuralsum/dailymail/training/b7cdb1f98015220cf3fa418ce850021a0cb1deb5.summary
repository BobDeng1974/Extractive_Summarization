by @entity0 one glass of wine or beer at the age of 14 can set teenagers on a path to binge drinking by 16 , a new study has found a single glass of wine or beer at the age of 14 can help a young teenager along the path to binge drinking , say scientists			1
early alcohol experience is one of a wide range of factors that can be used to identify future binge drinkers , experts said today			1
others include personality traits such as risk and sensation seeking , family history , genetics and brain structure			0
combined together , they were able to predict who from a large group of 14 - year - olds would be binge drinking by the age of 16 with 70 per cent accuracy			1
having even a single alcoholic drink at the age of 14 was shown to be a ' powerful ' predictor of binge drinking , possibly because of its association with risk - taking and impulsivity			1
dr @entity38 , from the @entity39 in @entity40 , who co-led the study , said the vulnerable period between the ages of 14 and 16 was ' critical ' to a young person ’s future drinking behaviour			1
' just delaying people drinking by six months or a year is actually a very , very substantial intervention that would have vast beneficial consequences , ' he added			2
a computer was used to analyse a wealth of data on more than 2,000 14 - year - olds from @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 and @entity56			1
all were participants in @entity58 , a major ongoing study of adolescent development			2
the software looked for patterns that singled out those youngsters who went on to become binge drinkers by the age of 16 - defined as having got drunk on at least three separate occasions			1
results were confirmed by predicting binge drinking with the same accuracy in a separate group of teenagers			2
the findings appear in the latest issue of the journal @entity75			0
' notably , it ’s not the case that there ’s a single one or two or three variables that are critical , ' said dr @entity38			0
' the final model was very broad - it suggests that a wide mixture of reasons underlie teenage drinking			2
' one surprising discovery was that bigger brains in 14 - year - olds are associated with future binge drinking			1
adolescents undergo significant rewiring in their developing brains , so that it is normal for their brains to reduce to a more efficient size			0
bigger brains in adolescents are therefore a sign of immaturity			0
scientists at the @entity39 in @entity40 found early alcohol consumption was a factor in determining who would binge drink			1
they found delaying a first alcoholic drink by just six months made a difference ' there ’s refining and sculpting of the brain , and most of the grey matter - the neurons and the connections between them - is getting smaller and the white matter ( made from nerve fibres ) is getting larger , ' said dr @entity38			0
' kids with more immature brains - those that are still larger - are more likely to drink			0
' co-author and @entity58 leader professor @entity123 , from the @entity120 at @entity121 , said : ' we aimed to develop a ‘ gold standard ’ model for predicting teenage behaviour , which can be used as a benchmark for the development of simpler , widely applicable prediction models			0
' this work will inform the development of specific early interventions in carriers of the risk profile to reduce the incidence of adolescent substance abuse			0
we now propose to extend analysis of the @entity58 data in order to investigate the development of substance use patterns in the context of moderating environmental factors , such as exposure to nicotine or drugs as well as psychosocial stress			0

scientists at the @entity39 in @entity40 discovered early alcohol experience is linked to binge drinking later in life
study predicted which 14 - year - olds taking part would end up binge drinkers by the age of 16 with 70 per cent accuracy
*researchers* defined binge drinking as being drunk three separate times
