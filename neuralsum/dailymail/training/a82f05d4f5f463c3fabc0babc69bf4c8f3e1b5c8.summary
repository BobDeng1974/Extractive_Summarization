an ' alien ' planet believed to be up to five times bigger than @entity2 has been detected 300 light years from @entity3			1
the giant ball of gas has been pictured orbiting its young star by the @entity7			2
the planet , known as @entity9 , is shown as a bright blue dot at the bottom left of the picture and was spotted by the @entity7 's @entity13 in @entity14			1
the image from @entity7 's @entity13 shows the newly - discovered planet @entity17 b , next to its parent star the star , @entity9 , has been removed from the picture to allow the planet to shine through , @entity20 has reported			1
@entity24 , astronomer at the @entity25 in @entity26 , is lead author of the study			0
announcing the discovery he said : ' direct imaging of planets is an extremely challenging technique that requires the most advanced instruments , whether ground - based or in space			0
' only a few planets have been directly observed so far , making every single discovery an important milestone on the road to understanding giant planets and how they form			0
' the researchers have said it may be the lightest , or ' least massive ' , planet that is not in the solar system and has been directly observed			1
this picture shows the sky around the young star @entity9 in the southern constellation of @entity48 ( @entity49 )			0
it was created from images from the @entity52 2 most exoplanets are not pictured directly but are often detected through indirect means , such as noticing a dip in a star 's brightness when a planet passes in front of it , blocking its light			1
according to the research , which will be published in an upcoming image of @entity66 , the planet orbits the star at about 56 times the distance between @entity3 and the @entity69 last week @entity70 reported how @entity72 's @entity71 could be used to find alien planets capable of supporting life			2
researchers at @entity76 said the telescope could look for small , @entity79 - size rocky exoplanets orbiting ' failed stars ' , known as brown dwarfs			0
they said the hunt could uncover planets capable of supporting life .			0

*scientists* *estimate* the planet could be up to five times bigger than @entity2
still the ' least massive ' planet directly pictured outside solar system
image *captured* by @entity7 's @entity13
