by @entity0 published : 18:35 est , 29 july 2012 updated : 18:35 est , 29 july 2012 downturn : business leaders and economists last night called for interest rates to be slashed to zero - amid warnings that @entity6 could face an unprecedented ' triple - dip ' recession			1
this has piled further pressure on @entity10 , pictured business leaders and economists last night called for interest rates to be slashed to zero – amid warnings that @entity6 could face an unprecedented ‘ triple - dip ’ recession			1
the @entity14 ( @entity14 ) urged the @entity15 to take immediate action to slash the cost of borrowing to homeowners and business , following shock growth figures last week showing the economic downturn is accelerating			1
economists at the @entity23 also backed the call , saying an interest rate cut was ‘ not the only answer , but it would help ’			0
the two organisations are the only forecasters to use the same economic model as the @entity30 , meaning their conclusions are based on identical data to that used by chancellor @entity10			0
their intervention comes amid warnings that @entity6 could suffer an extraordinary triple - dip recession unless urgent action is taken to boost growth			1
official figures last week showed @entity6 ’s economy shrank by 0.7 per cent between april and june			2
most analysts believe the @entity43 effect will pull @entity6 out of recession later this year			1
but , with the eurozone crisis unresolved , there are growing fears of a fresh downturn next year – turning the current double - dip recession into a triple - dip			1
@entity51 , an analyst at @entity52 , said @entity6 would enjoy an economic bounce until next spring , but would then slump back into recession unless action was taken to resolve the eurozone crisis			1
@entity57 , at @entity58 , said the outlook was ‘ disastrously bad compared with previous [ economic ] cycles ’			0
the @entity15 ’s monetary policy committee is already under pressure to cut interest rates from their historic low of 0.5 per cent			2
some commentators believe a cut to 0.25 per cent could be agreed this week , but others want the bank to go further and slash rates to zero			2
pressure : the @entity14 has urged the @entity15 , pictured , to take immediate action to slash the cost of borrowing to homeowners and business action on this scale would knock almost £ 500 a year off a typical £ 150,000 tracker mortgage – putting money directly into the hands of cash - strapped families			1
it could also help businesses struggling to pay their debts			0
but it would be bad news for savers , pensioners and those approaching retirement , who are already suffering the effects of years of low interest rates			0
@entity92 , chief economist at the @entity14 , said a rate cut would be more effective in boosting demand and easing inflation than another round of the quantitative easing recently favoured by the @entity15			1
‘ a rate cut now could really help business , ’ he said			0
‘ @entity101 inflation is critical to underpinning real incomes and sustaining demand in the @entity6 economy			2
’ but former @entity106 chancellor @entity105 warned that existing low rates were already distorting the markets and having a dramatic effect on pensioners			0
mr @entity10 received a rare boost at the weekend when the ratings agency @entity112 ’s confirmed @entity6 ’s coveted @entity114 credit rating , which allows the government to borrow at rock - bottom rates to service the debts left by @entity118			1
the chancellor said the verdict showed the government was on the right track			0
he added : ‘ this is a reminder that despite the economic problems we face , the world has confidence that we are dealing with them			0
’ but shadow chancellor @entity129 said : ‘ the long - term impact on the underlying strength of the @entity6 economy will be more young people unemployed and businesses investing in other parts of the world			2
' all those things add up to an economy which ends up permanently weaker , not just temporarily weaker			0
