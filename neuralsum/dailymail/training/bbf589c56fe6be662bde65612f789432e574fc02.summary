the planet is ' f * * cked ' after scientists found huge plumes of deadly methane escaping from the seafloor			2
this is according to dr @entity7 who claims that methane will be the main driver of climate change if it escapes into the atmosphere			1
this is according to dr @entity7 who claims that methane could be the main driver of climate change the scientist , based at the @entity25 and @entity26 , tweeted the provocative statement after a @entity29 study found methane leaking beneath the @entity15			1
some of this methane – which is over 20 times more potent than @entity32 at trapping heat - is now making it to the ocean 's surface			1
the leaking gas from the seafloor may have its origins in collapsing clusters of methane trapped in frozen water due to high pressure and low temperature			0
scientists at @entity46 called the discovery ' somewhat of a surprise , ' which , according to dr box , is an understatement			2
leaking gas from the seafloor may have its origins in collapsing clusters of methane trapped in frozen water due to high pressure and low temperature			0
pictured are methane bubbles escaping from a lake in @entity56 ' we 're on a trajectory to an unmanageable heating scenario , and we need to get off it , ' dr @entity7 told @entity61 at @entity62 ' we 're f * * ked at a certain point , right ? it just becomes unmanageable			1
the climate dragon is being poked , and eventually the dragon becomes pissed off enough to trash the place			0
' methane is the second - largest greenhouse gas contributor to climate change			0
the gas is 23 times more potent than carbon dioxide in trapping heat and is currently being targeted by government in an attempt to mitigate global warming			1
methane pollution has declined by 11 per cent since 1990 even as the governments has pushed for greater use of natural gas			0
but the longer view on methane pollution show that it will rise			0
the @entity84 administration points to studies that show that methane pollution is projected to increase to a level equivalent to over 620 million tonnes of carbon dioxide pollution in 2030 , if no action is taken			1
the conventional thought is that the bubbles would be dissolved before they reached the surface and that microorganisms would consume that methane			2
but dr @entity7 said if the plumes are making it to the surface , there 's a new source of heat - trapping gases that the planet needs to worry about			1
this , he claims , is particularly disturbing because the @entity15 is warming faster than nearly anywhere else on @entity104			2
his comments follow research in may which found that freshwater sources may be an unrealised source of methane			0
unlike carbon dioxide , which is highly soluble in water , methane exists in two forms in these freshwater sources : as a dissolved gas and encapsulated in bubbles that rise from sediments			1
and this methane can lead to ozone production and levels of the gas in the atmosphere are 150 per cent higher than they were before the industrial revolution in @entity125 it is already known that in the melting regions of the @entity15 where lakes , known as thermokarsts , which are lakes that break down plant material into methane			2
this methane can then escape out of the lake , and once lit , could set ice on fire			0
the melting ice can also lead to ' drunken trees ' as the firm soil slowly transforms into mud causing the plants that grow in them to lean to one side			0
' i may escape a lot of this , ' dr @entity7 told @entity62 , ' but my daughter might not			1
she 's three years old			0
' from left to right in the left image : @entity150 , captain @entity151 and @entity152 lead the @entity46 study			2
they are pictured here on bridge of their ship with methane flare on screen			0
on the right is dr @entity7 who is worried about methane release in the atmosphere			1

claim was made by dr @entity7 about a study at @entity46
methane is 23 times more potent than carbon dioxide in trapping heat
scientists *believed* bubbles would dissolve before they reached surface
but the study found large amounts of leaked methane in the @entity15
