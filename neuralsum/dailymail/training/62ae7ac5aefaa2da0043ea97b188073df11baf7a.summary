a breakthrough international trial of a new cancer drug has given researchers renewed hope in the fight against leukaemia , with one @entity7 doctor suggesting it could end traditional chemotherapy treatments for good			1
the results of a trial on 391 patients showed the drug @entity14 gave patients fighting a type of slow growing blood cancer called chronic lymphocytic leukaemia ( @entity19 ) a 90 per cent chance of survival , eight higher than the 81 per cent who survive on chemotherapy treatment			1
what 's more , the drug is less invasive than traditional forms of radiation , and is an alternative for patients whose cancer cells have built up a resistance to chemotherapy			1
results from the trial also showed that four out of every 10 patients entered remission within a year , compared to four in 100 on a traditional course of radiation			1
@entity14 works by killing cells in chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients and could be the perfect alternative to traditional chemotherapy treatments the trial has dr @entity43 of @entity45 's @entity44 confident that @entity14 will eventually replace chemotherapy as the main treatment for leukaemia patients			1
he told @entity49 : ' we might not need chemotherapy at all			0
' dr @entity43 said patients on the international trial responded quicker to the drug than chemotherapy and showed fewer side effects			2
what was also particularly encouraging was that patients who do not respond to , or have a resistance to chemotherapy treatments , now have an alternative			2
dr @entity43 , left , is hopeful that @entity14 is the alternative answer to invasive chemotherapy treatments ' these resistant patients have no other treatment option , ' the co-author of a @entity67 report said			2
' this pill works extremely well when chemotherapy stops working			0
' the drug , which works by by disabling an enzyme crucial for leukaemia 's survival , is currently being fast tracked for approval in the @entity77 and it could be just a year before @entity7 have access to it			1
although one of the rarest forms of cancer , @entity80 is the most common type of leukaemia and the older you are the higher the chance you have of developing it			0
almost 80 per cent of all new cases are diagnosed in people over the age of 60			0
it occurs more frequently in men than women , and because it develops slowly , many people do n't show symptoms in its early stages			0
dr @entity43 said hundreds of @entity7 a year will benefit from the @entity77 - developed drug when it comes to @entity7 next year , but it 's unlikely most will be able to afford it until it is listed on @entity7 's pharmaceutical benefits scheme in two to three years .			0

@entity14 drug trial showed better rates of survival than chemotherapy
patients in @entity7 could have access to @entity14 within a year
trial showed higher rate of people entered remission than chemotherapy
breakthrough alternative for people with resistance to chemotherapy
