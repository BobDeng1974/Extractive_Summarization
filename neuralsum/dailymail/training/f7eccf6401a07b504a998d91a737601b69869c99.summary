@entity0 has fully embraced her new title as a dame by commissioning her own coat of arms as the tv presenter known for introducing knobbly vegetables and talking dogs to the nation , @entity0 admitted she was as shocked as anybody when she was made a @entity10 in the @entity11			1
but now the 74 - year - old has fully embraced her new title – and decided to commission her own coat of arms			1
the former @entity15 host , who received her damehood for charity work , has been in contact with the @entity19 about producing a design based on her long career			2
‘ i have asked them about how long it takes and the cost , ’ she said			1
‘ the bad news is it could be a year and about £ 4,000			1
’ so while she waits , @entity27 has stepped in to create an idea of what it could look like , complete with a motto that reads ‘ that ’s life ’ in @entity32 when we presented her with the design , @entity33 was delighted			1
‘ it is terrific and wonderful ’ she said last night			2
‘ i ’m completely thrilled , it sums me up			2
@entity38 – i like that motto			2
’ our version might seem cheeky , but it incorporates elements @entity33 wanted for her insignia – even the big teeth for which she is famed			2
‘ i would like a blue stocking because of my @entity47 connection , a big pair of teeth , a phone for @entity51 , a knobbly vegetable and a talking dog from @entity15 , ’ she said			0
the @entity19 say there are no fixed criteria of eligibility for an official coat of arms , ‘ but such things as awards or honours from the @entity62 ... are taken into account			1
’ @entity33 said : ‘ i will put my crest of arms on the mantelpiece and maybe have it engraved on the windows of my house in @entity69 and the @entity70			1
‘ i do n’t want to be flash but maybe i could have it on the bonnet of my small @entity74 , like they do with a @entity76			0
’ a coat of arms is also a throwback to her first on - screen job in television			1
‘ the first thing i did when i worked on @entity82 in 1968 was research about coat of arms , ’ she said			1
‘ so this has been a suppressed ambition of mine for nearly 46 years			0
i would never have dreamed of it			0
and it is all because of @entity51 and @entity90 [ a similar helpline for the elderly ]			0
’ the @entity27 ’s highly trained heraldic experts ( well , our in - house artist ) created this crest with the motto ‘ that ’s life ’ in @entity32 our crest for @entity33 includes elements of her career such as her distinctive teeth ; oddly - shaped carrots and the dog who said ‘ sausages ’ from @entity15 ; and a phone to represent @entity51			2
stockings represent her once all - female @entity109 college @entity47 ; ‘ bluestocking ’ is an old term for an educated woman			0
she explained that the cost of getting a coat of arms was high ‘ because it requires a lot of attention ; it involves artists and craftsmen and it ’s on vellum ’			1
@entity120 is traditionally made from calf ’s skin , but @entity33 said she would n’t want a coat of arms if it compromised her stance against animal cruelty			1
speaking about adjusting to life as a @entity10 she added : ‘ my children call me @entity128 , and the shoe store @entity130 call me miss @entity10			0
being called @entity10 is disconcerting			0
it takes some getting used to			0
’ she will visit @entity132 to officially receive her honour sometime in the next six months but is concerned about how she will pull off a hat in front of royalty			0
she said : ‘ i do n’t know if it will be the @entity138 or prince @entity139			0
i ’m more worried about what hat to wear			0
i look worse in hats than @entity142			0
’ coincidentally , @entity139 ’s in - laws , the @entity143 , got their own coat of arms just before the @entity146 .			1

dame @entity0 , 74 , has commissioned her own coat of arms
process could take a year and cost the tv presenter around £ 4,000
while she waits , the @entity154 created an idea of what it could look like ...
