by @entity0 given that the @entity1 frequently raids her mother ’s wardrobe , perhaps this is @entity4 ’s way of getting her own back			1
the 57 - year - old wore an unusual fur headband around her white safety helmet during a family holiday to the upmarket @entity11 ski resort of @entity12			1
while @entity1 , 30 , and her husband were both sporting rather more mundane black protective headwear , mrs @entity4 ’s choice of fluffy accessory made her stand out on the slopes			1
turning heads : in her distinctive headband , @entity4 sits next to son - in - law @entity20 on a ski lift in @entity11 freebie : @entity4 's helmet headband was originally destined for @entity1 's head when it was sent to the @entity25 from @entity27 firm @entity26 family affair : @entity4 , left , enjoys a quiet moment on the ski lift with the @entity20 and her daughter @entity1 , centre , aswell as her brother @entity33 , right			1
function over fashion : @entity1 opted to ski in a rather more mundane black helmet when she took to the slopes but it seems the fake fur band was originally destined for @entity1 ’s head – and was sent to her by @entity27 firm @entity26 , via her parents ’ company , after her engagement to prince @entity20 was announced in late 2010			1
it was a canny marketing ploy by the @entity45 - based skiwear accessories firm , whose motto is ‘ drab to fab in seconds ’ , as anything @entity1 wears , from dresses to wellington boots , usually sells out instantly			2
it is not clear whether the @entity1 , an accomplished skier , ever got to try out the gift , which sells for £ 29.99			2
but it certainly found favour with her mother – before finding its way into her suitcase for the recent holiday			2
unusually for a family that prides itself on its discretion , mrs @entity4 even sent a letter to @entity26 ’s founder , @entity66 , to thank her for the present			2
handwritten on headed paper sent from the family ’s £ 1.5million home in @entity72 , @entity73 , it warned mrs @entity66 that ‘ we ’ – presumably meaning @entity4 and her husband @entity75 – ‘ do not normally accept gifts ’			2
but it went on to describe the ski helmet band as ‘ lovely ’ and wished mrs @entity66 , who set up the company in 2010 , success in her venture			2
it read : ‘ thank you very much for the helmet headband			0
family fun : @entity85 , left , appeared comfortable on the @entity11 slopes , while her sister @entity1 , right , has a reflective moment during the break on the climb : the @entity91 and @entity1 climb to the top of a slope during their extended @entity96 break in control : @entity85 looked calm and composed as she showed her skills on the slopes ‘ we do not normally accept gifts and would be grateful if you could not send anything else , but i think it ’s a lovely product and wish you every success			1
’ while secretly delighted to have received the letter , mrs @entity66 thought nothing more of it until she saw photographs of mrs @entity4 wearing the ‘ @entity114 ’ headband on a ski lift with the @entity91 in the @entity113			1
‘ i was astonished and could n’t be happier , ’ she told the @entity115			0
leading the way : @entity4 and @entity1 head down the slopes , while prince @entity20 hangs back slightly uphilll laying low : prince @entity20 crouches down while demonstrating some less conventional skiiing skills in @entity12 ‘ we are a new business in a very competitive market so it was a massive boost to @entity123 to see her in it			1
@entity4 is a very stylish woman and we think it looks great on her			0
’ the @entity127 wrote a handwritten letter to mrs @entity66 thanking her for the fur hat mrs @entity66 , who has skied since she was a teenager , created the product after being forced to wear a helmet when she took up snowboarding			0
‘ the main reason i did n’t wear one before was vanity , i suppose , ’ she explained			0
‘ unless you really do look like @entity1 , then they really are n’t very flattering			0
i had a lovely collection of fur hats that i used to wear and so decided to create something based on them that made the helmet look better			0
‘ the @entity26 is non-slip and can just be attached around the helmet			0
it cost me £ 40,000 to set the business up but we have been growing steadily			0
‘ that said , to see @entity4 wearing it is such an unbelievable boost and just goes to show that nothing ventured , nothing gained			0
’ designed to encourage more women to wear helmets , the @entity114 headband worn by mrs @entity4 is one of the firm ’s best - selling products			0
should she feel so inclined , the royal in - law could also buy a matching helmet tail , scarf , cuff , snood or even faux fur boot toppers to complete the look			1
unlike members of the royal family , the @entity162 do not have to declare any gifts given to them			1
@entity1 seemed happy to stick to her own headwear rather than borrow her mother 's , while @entity85 was also safety - conscious leg work : @entity1 maintains her balance as she ascends another slope in the @entity113 time with the in - laws : prince @entity20 skis in front of his mother - in - law @entity4 , while @entity1 looks on			1
@entity1 , right , later took in the view as she climbed back to the top of the slope and their daughter only has to record on the official @entity180 details of items received during the course of her public duties since marrying prince @entity20 last year			0
mr and mrs @entity4 are entrepreneurs themselves and run a hugely successful internet - based firm , @entity187 , which sells children ’s party goods			0
the couple have been repeatedly accused of cashing in on their daughter ’s association with the royal family , although sources close to them insist they have done their best to manage their long - standing business without causing embarrassment to the @entity91 and @entity1 .			1
