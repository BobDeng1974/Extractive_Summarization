on just a normal day in the office , @entity0 made the most shocking discovery of his life			1
in october 2005 , the professor of psychiatry and human behaviour at the @entity7 was working on his special subject — the brain scans of psychopathic murderers			1
‘ these are some of the most dangerous people you can imagine , ’ he says			1
‘ they had done some heinous things over the years , things that would make you shudder			2
’ during 20 years of analysing brain scans , he ’d noticed how cold , hardened murderers had alarmingly low activity in the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain — the areas associated with empathy and self - control			1
without that self - restraint , they became crazed killers			1
the scan which proved to @entity0 that he was a psychopath that day in the city of @entity33 in @entity34 , professor @entity31 was working on genetic tests and brain scans of @entity38 ’s patients , comparing them to the results for his family , used as a control group			1
flicking through the family scans , he came across a particularly odd one			1
it showed all the classic traits of a murderous psychopath			2
he assumed his family scans had got mixed up with the scans of psychopathic murderers			1
horrifyingly , they had n’t			2
@entity0 as a young man ( left ) and ( right ) as he is today			1
he believes that the love of his parents kept his psychopathic tendencies from becoming dangerous , unlike his famous ancestor @entity58 when he cross-checked the reference number , he had the shock of his life			1
it was a scan of his own brain			1
the 66 - year - old , happily married father of three had led an exemplary existence , with a highly successful career at the top of his field			1
but he could n’t deny the evidence staring him in the face			2
‘ i am basically a normal person , except for one thing			2
i ’m a borderline psychopath , ’ he says			0
the 66 - year - old father of three has led a happy life and has excelled in a professional and personal capacity that was n’t the end of it			1
professor @entity31 then searched his family ’s dna for genes that are associated with violence , particularly the ‘ warrior gene ’ , which controls the amount of the hormone serotonin in the brain			1
serotonin has a calming effect , unless a person has the warrior gene , which prevents the hormone working its magic			0
guess what ? every member of his family had a low - violence genetic structure — except one : professor @entity31 himself			1
‘ i ’m 100 per cent , ’ he says			0
‘ i have the risky pattern			0
in a sense , i ’m a born killer			1
’ mr @entity0 made the shocking discovery while part of a research project at @entity106 , he was sifting through thousands of @entity108 scans to find anatomical patterns in the brain that correlated with psychopathic tendencies in the real world it gets even worse			1
it turns out that the professor ’s ancestors have made a speciality of killing			1
one day at a barbecue , his 88 - year - old mother let slip a dark family secret			1
‘ @entity122 , why do n’t you find out about your father ’s relatives ? ’ she said			0
‘ there were some cuckoos back there			0
’ pretty violent cuckoos , too			0
professor @entity31 is related to seven supposed murderers			1
among them is one of the most notorious suspected killers in @entity135 history , @entity58 , or ‘ @entity136 ’ , as professor @entity31 jokingly calls her			1
the @entity31 family : mr @entity0 has used brain scans of himself , his wife and children as a control group when he made the discovery in @entity143 in 1892 , she was tried and acquitted of killing her father and stepmother			1
despite her acquittal , she became the subject of one of the most popular skipping rope rhymes in @entity135 : ‘ @entity58 took an axe and gave her mother 40 whacks			1
when she saw what she had done			0
she gave her father 41			0
’ and a direct ancestor , @entity156 , was hanged in 1667 for murdering his mother			0
the @entity158 is the book that mr @entity0 has written about his research , and the shocking discovery that he , himself is a psychopath professor @entity31 , though , has never hurt a fly , despite having an overwhelming genetic and neurological tendency towards psychopathy			1
the realisation of his condition has changed his intellectual approach to the relationship between the brain and a person ’s character			2
before the discovery , he thought genetics determined your future — character was down to nature , not nurture			2
he has studied the brain scans of dozens of psychopathic killers and , again and again , has found the same results			1
compared to a healthy brain , the killers ’ brains had much less activity in the orbital cortex and around the amygdala — the areas that prevent impulsive action and control social behaviour , inhibition , morality and ethics			2
examining his own brain scan , he saw the same killer pattern			1
his brain has dark patches of low activity just behind the eyes , in that crucial orbital cortex area			2
‘ people with low activity in that area of the brain are free - wheeling types or sociopaths , ’ he says			1
now he believes the right sort of nurture can overcome the most evil form of nature			2
and the best sort of nurture comes from adoring parents			0
‘ i was loved and that has protected me , ’ he says			0
his parents ’ love , it seems , saved him from a life of violent crime and steered him towards a highly successful career			2
but it could n’t stop the vestiges of his psychopathy emerging in different ways			0
‘ i ’m obnoxiously competitive , ’ he says			0
‘ i wo n’t let my grandchildren win games and i do things that annoy other people			0
' but while i ’m aggressive , it is sublimated			0
i ’d rather beat someone in an argument than beat them up			0
’ in his youth , @entity31 suffered from panic attacks and an obsessive compulsive disorder , repeatedly washing his hands			0
he would stand up to bullies in bars , but never felt the temptation to fight them			0
‘ while many of the males in my family are athletic and several just love to fight , i never developed a taste for pugilism , ’ he says			1
‘ i prefer to mentally pummel someone than use bare knuckles			0
’ so , how has his shock discovery changed him ? the family control tests that mr @entity0 was studying when he made the discovery that his brain has the characteristics of a psychopath ‘ since finding all this out and looking into it , i ’ve made an effort to try to change my behaviour , ’ he says			1
‘ i ’ve consciously been doing what is considered the right thing to do and thinking more about other people ’s feelings			0
‘ at the same time , i ’m not doing this because i ’m suddenly nice			0
i ’m doing it because of pride , because i want to show to everyone and myself that i can pull it off			0
’ professor @entity31 ’s discovery about himself has made him fine - tune his study of what constitutes a psychopath			1
there is no rigid psychiatric diagnosis			0
in fact , it is defined simply as an anti-social personality disorder in which three or more of the following seven conditions feature : irresponsibility , deceit , reckless - ness , indifference to the welfare of others , a failure to plan ahead , aggression and irritability			2
professor @entity31 says the depictions of psychopaths in horror films and thrillers — such as @entity295 in @entity296 — are grotesque exaggerations			0
he also says that @entity299 , the self - loving , unhinged character played by @entity300 in the film @entity301 , is not representative of a true psychopath			2
‘ he is too violent to be realistic , ’ he says			0
however , the professor thinks the violent @entity305 mobster @entity304 , played by @entity306 in @entity307 , is closer to a realistic depiction of a psychopath			0
‘ they are relatively normal - looking people who you might pass on the street and not think twice about , ’ he says			2
‘ but they are deeply disturbed individuals who ultimately can not control their innate aggressiveness and show little regret or sympathy for their violent actions			0
’ to produce those characteristics , it appears , it ’s not enough to have the genetic or neurological psychopath brain pattern			2
that has to be accompanied by a family history of abuse or violence			2
fortunately for @entity31 , his family has enabled him to overcome his genetic and neuro - logical characteristics and become what he describes as a pro-social psychopath			1
‘ i have come to understand that humans are , by nature , complicated creatures , ’ he says			0
‘ and to reduce our actions , motivations , desires and needs to absolutes is doing each of us a disservice			0
‘ we are not simply good or evil , right or wrong , kind or vindictive , benign or dangerous			2
‘ we are not simply the product of biology , either			0
science can tell us only part of the story			0
’ our genes , then , do n’t determine our fate , but they have the power to send us in a certain evil direction			0
how consoling that evil can be defeated by an even greater influence — a parent ’s love .			1

@entity0 was studying brain scans when he made the discovery
his family is related to infamous suspected parent - killer @entity58
after coming to terms with the news mr @entity0 has written a book
he believes that the love of his family prevented dangerous behaviours
