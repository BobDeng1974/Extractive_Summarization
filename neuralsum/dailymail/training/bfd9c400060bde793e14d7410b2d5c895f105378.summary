he was the hardman ruler of the @entity2 's most loyal vassal state who faced off against @entity4 and commanded an army of a million men ... but he could n't stand to be around his wife			0
east @entity9 leader @entity8 was so fed up in his marriage with wife @entity11 that he even arranged for her to go on separate foreign trips when he was away so she would n't be able to travel with him			2
he referred to her behind her back with the name the streets gave to her , ' the purple dragon ' , from the sometimes bizarre shades of colouring she used on her hair			0
public face : @entity8 and wife @entity22 , seen in their adopted home in @entity25 , @entity26 , displayed an image of being happily married			1
but new files paint a very different picture intelligence reports collated by the @entity32 spy service of @entity33 have just been published and show that @entity8 , who ruled the so - called @entity34 for 28 years , had a ' difficult ' marriage with his partner @entity11 that he eased by indulging in affairs			1
while he and his politburo preached the benefits of marriage to building a ' strong socialist state ' , @entity8 played away when he got the chance			2
once when he was invited to @entity44 in 1981 he made sure his @entity46 brethren in then @entity47 invited her - she was the country 's education minister - to @entity50 at the same time			0

according to the files , the marriage to @entity11 was apparently ' already over by this time in all but name and was only being held together for party and state purposes			0
' while @entity8 was reportedly having an affair with one of his co-workers , @entity11 was linked to one of the country â€™s top economists @entity70 , according to @entity72 magazine , which accessed the @entity32 files			2
east @entity9 guards look on as the @entity75 is destroyed in 1989 @entity32 snoops painted @entity8 as something of a sexual predator who particularly liked younger females and observed that the the politburo ' pressured @entity8 into marrying @entity11 in 1953 so that his frequent affairs with young girls would have an end '			1
the couple only married after the birth of their daughter @entity87 in 1952 , which itself occurred during his first marriage to @entity90			0
@entity8 was also quoted as saying to an aide that his wife ' exasperated ' him - and he wondered if ' western leaders have this problem ? ' @entity32 transcripts also showed how he abused his position in other ways			0
in december 1981 , as the @entity98 still dragged on , he took thousands of border guards and troops from front line @entity102 duty to search for a suitable hunting dog across the country			0
secrets : @entity8 , pictured taking a walk in his neighbourhood of @entity109 in @entity25 , in 1993 , died of liver cancer long before details emerged addicted to hunting , @entity8 felt he was let down when foreign dignitaries joined him on his killing expeditions in the woods around @entity75 because he did n't have a ' suitable hound '			1
