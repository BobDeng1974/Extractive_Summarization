by @entity0 question marks were raised over the future of the @entity4 licence fee yesterday as it emerged growing numbers of young people are using free catch - up services instead of watching live television			1
figures revealed viewers aged between 16 and 24 now spend just half their time watching shows as they are broadcast			0
the rest of the time they use free catch - up services such as @entity17 , as well as dvds , recorded tv programmes or films and shows they have bought and downloaded via the internet			1
the @entity4 is coming under intense pressure to close the loophole which allows catch - up shows to be watched free of charge , amid concerns older viewers are effectively being penalised for watching on traditional tv sets rather than tablets , smartphones and laptops			2
the vast majority of older viewers still watch their favourite shows as they are broadcast , meaning they are obliged to pay the licence fee			1
according to figures published yesterday by @entity50 , just three per cent of the viewing of those aged between 55 and 64 is on catch - up platforms such as @entity17 , while 80 per cent is live			1
on average , adults spent an average of two hours 58 minutes a day watching live television			0
catch - up services are much more popular with the young , accounting for seven per cent of their viewing time			2
just three per cent of 16 to 24 - year - olds said they would miss watching live tv , compared to 31 per cent of those aged over 65			1
in recent years the @entity4 has encouraged growing numbers of viewers to watch its tv shows on iplayer but has yet to close the loophole that makes catch - up viewing free of charge			1
@entity17 attracted 234million hits in february this year , which was a 21 per cent increase in just 12 months and earlier this year , the corporation ’s director - general @entity72 announced plans to close youth channel @entity75 and put all of its content on @entity17			1
the catch - up platform attracted 234million hits in february this year , a 21 per cent increase in a year			1
although @entity72 has said he wants to close the @entity17 loophole and extend the licence fee to catch - up tv , insiders claim such a change would be hard to enforce			1
as the @entity4 currently has no way of checking who watches @entity17 , it would have to issue every genuine licence fee payer with a code before they can access the website			1
in june , the @entity91 revealed two million households have told the @entity4 they do not need a tv licence because they do not have tv sets and do not watch live programmes			2
the number of people who have legally opted out of the charge has risen by almost 40,000 in the past two years , prompting claims the corporation is struggling to adapt to the internet age			0
a @entity4 spokesman said : ‘ as the data shows young people still spend two thirds of their viewing time watching live or recorded tv which needs to be covered by a tv licence			2
well under two per cent of households watch only catch - up tv			2
’ @entity111 adults spend more time in front of screens or on the phone than they do sleeping			0
we spend an average of eight hours and 41 minutes every day on our phones or computers , compared with eight hours and 21 minutes asleep			0
the figure rises to nine hours and eight minutes among those aged 16 to 24 , @entity50 said			0
and when multi-tasking is taken into account – such as using @entity123 while watching tv – we spend an average of 11 hours a day using new technology , an increase of two hours since 2010			0
however , the research also showed that the time spent watching tv has fallen			0
last year we spent an average of three hours and 52 minutes a day in front of our television sets			0
in 2012 the average was four hours and one minute			0
it was the first time since 2009 that tv viewing has fallen below four hours a day .			0

fears growing that younger viewers are dodging licence fee by going online
£ 145.50 annual charge only applies to live tv and does *n't* cover @entity17
@entity17 attracted 234million hits in february - 21 per cent increase in a year
