the grand jury that did not indict @entity2 police officer @entity1 was focused on whether he might have acted in self - defense when he shot and killed unarmed teenager @entity4			1
but the case raises another question : could @entity1 have avoided getting into a spot where he had to make that split - second , life - or - death decision ? departments around the country have in recent years stepped up their training in de-escalation — the art of defusing a tense situation with a word or a gesture instead of reaching for a weapon			1
supporters of a calmer police response include the @entity43			1
they suggest that this will improve trust and understanding between police and residents , curtail the unnecessary use of force and improve the safety of officers and civilians alike			1
@entity54 , @entity55 , police commissioner @entity56 said : ' we have n't taught officers to just walk away			1
' ' but if the only reason a person is acting up is because you 're standing there ... is n't that a viable approach ? ' @entity56 and other law enforcement officials said they did n't want to second - guess @entity1 's actions because they were n't in his shoes at the time of the august 9 shooting			2
aggressive : police officers stand near a crowd gathering by the scene where 18 - year - old @entity4 was fatally shot by a police officer in @entity2 , in future officers may be trained to act with more restraint but , many said , the case should accelerate a national discussion about police culture and the potential for broader training in de-escalation			1
this is considered to be especially important in dealing with people in mental health or drug - related crises			1
in @entity87 this month , a federal law enforcement team held training with @entity90 - area police , including top commanders from @entity2 , on how unintentional bias affects police work			1
that approach goes hand - in - hand with de-escalation			1
@entity97 , the former @entity21 attorney in @entity98 who led the effort to curb excessive uses of force by city police said it was important for each to consider the other 's perspective			1
' in every police encounter , the officer and the civilian bring with them and see the world through their experiences			2
' ' the more these views diverge , the more they immediately see the other as a threat			0
' according to @entity1 's grand jury testimony , @entity4 and a friend were walking down the middle of the street when he drove up and asked them to use the sidewalk			0
when they declined , he suggested it again			0
@entity4 allegedly responded by cursing at him , according to @entity1 said			0
he said he backed up his vehicle to confront @entity4 , who was carrying stolen cigars			0
@entity4 shoved the vehicle 's door shut as @entity1 tried to open it , and then attacked the officer through the door 's open window , @entity1 said			0
the officer began shooting , then got out of the car , chased @entity4 , and fired some more when @entity4 turned around			0
' my job is n't to just sit and wait , ' @entity1 told @entity134			0
solemn : six members of @entity4 's family sit around the table in @entity2 on thursday night and set out a seat for the slain teen at @entity142 dinner in its investigations of police agencies , the @entity43 has singled out poor de-escalation tactics			1
in a july report on the @entity148 , @entity149 , department , the @entity43 faulted a ' pattern and practice of taking immediate offensive action			1
this was done rather than acting within the bounds of the @entity155 and displaying the ' thick skin and patience ' needed for the job			0
in @entity98 and in @entity159 , @entity160 , the @entity43 blasted police for too quickly using flashlights , batons or stun guns as weapons when force could have been avoided			1
in @entity98 in 2010 , an officer killed a @entity169 woodcarver who had crossed the street while holding a small knife and a block of wood			0
the officer got out of his car , and when the carver — who turned out to be hard of hearing — did n't immediately drop the tool as ordered , he was shot			0
like @entity1 , the officer was n't charged criminally because of the high bar for such prosecutions against police , but the case helped spur the federal civil rights investigation of the department			2
protests : protests raged in @entity2 as people reacted to the death of the teenager @entity190 handed : police wearing riot gear point their weapons before arresting a man in @entity2 a consent decree overhauled the department 's training , putting a premium on de-escalation and bias - free policing			1
the @entity43 has already launched a similar investigation in @entity2			1
@entity98 police spokesman @entity203 said in practice , de-escalation can take many forms			2
sometimes it means that multiple officers respond rather than one , because the larger presence can make excitable subjects realize they 're outnumbered			2
but for an officer , it can also mean calmly introducing yourself , listening to what someone is saying and simply relating to the person			0
the use of body - worn cameras can also help , experts say , because both officers and civilians tend to behave better when they know they 're being recorded			1
' if we can use language and presence to get people to comply with lawful orders , we can consider that a win , ' @entity203 said			2
still , reducing tension can be easier said than done			0
in a 2012 report from the @entity233 it describes challenges in utilizing de-escalation techniques			2
it said a younger generation of officers accustomed to communicating through text messaging and social media may be less adept in the personal communication skills needed			0
and some officers worry about giving away the upper hand			0
a group of @entity98 police officers sued over the department 's new use - of - force policy			1
they said while they too want to prevent excessive uses of force , the policy is overly complicated and could endanger officers by requiring them to hesitate before using force			0
a federal judge dismissed the lawsuit , but the officers have appealed			0
' traditional police training reinforces that you must always display a very strong , assertive presence , " said @entity258 , executive director of @entity260 's police academy			2
' but if the officer reacts to a challenge as most human beings would — by challenging back — the situation is going to devolve			0

departments around the country are training officers in de-escalation
they suggest this will improve trust between police and residents
