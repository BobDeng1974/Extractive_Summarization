the chant @entity1 fans directed at £ 60m @entity2 on friday night was an indicator of how much football can change in a short period of time			1
' what a waste of money , ' heckled the supporters , with the former @entity11 star flattering to deceive as @entity12 failed to break down their @entity14 counterparts in the @entity15			1
after a blistering start to life in the @entity19 , the club record fee splashed out on @entity20 was heralded as a snip			1
but while the @entity23 obviously has the quality , things are just not clicking under @entity25 at present			1
@entity2 struggled at @entity1 and was the subject of ' what a waste of money ' chants @entity20 , pictured alongside @entity25 , was signed for a club record fee of £ 60m last summer comparisons can of course be drawn to @entity33 who also flew out of the blocks before suffering with injuries and form , while @entity37 is obviously an entirely different prospect to the @entity19			1
it is easier to pinpoint @entity20 's dip in form , though			1
@entity12 could n't have pulled off a more suitable signature if they had tried when they lured the 26 - year - old to @entity44			1
the winger was in the form of his life , man of the match in the @entity51 final last season , starring at the @entity53 with @entity54			0
this was the man to reinvigorate the @entity57 , that flying no 7 fans crave in @entity59			0
a goal on his @entity62 bow against @entity64 , as well as several fancy flicks and tricks , suggested @entity12 had found their new hero			2
@entity69 's @entity68 even claimed that there may not have been a better home debut since @entity73 's hat - trick in 2004			0
he made 76 passes in that game , compared to just 21 against @entity76 in his most recent home outing			0
@entity20 's home debut , a goalscoring one against @entity64 , was one of the best @entity12 fans had ever seen @entity20 's touch map against @entity64 in september ( left ) , compared to his stats against @entity76 this month the @entity23 winger netted a superb chip against @entity85 to make it two in two for @entity12 @entity20 seemed to be enjoying his role in the midfield diamond ( touch maps against @entity85 and @entity90 ) the @entity62 faithful love their no 7s and they seemed to have their hands on a new star a superb chip at @entity85 followed , while he also netted against @entity90			1
@entity12 would have been bereft of ideas during their 2 - 2 draw at @entity99 in october were it not for @entity20 impressing in a diamond formation , or even in the much maligned 3 - 5 - 2			1
but @entity102 was obviously uneasy with how his team were playing , and most importantly , defending			0
@entity12 had conceded 12 league goals in eight games after the draw at the @entity108 , they 've conceded nine in 14 since			2
' that is what the club has been built on for the last 10 to 15 years – being able to get from box to box quickly , being able to spring on teams , having people that can dribble and are quick in the final third , ' @entity111 pundit and @entity12 legend @entity110 said in august			2
' this signing fits the bill in terms of what @entity12 are and the philosophy			2
' @entity20 's swashbucking runs forward have since disappeared			2
that pace and drive with the ball , with which he gathers confidence to show off his ability , seems to have been reined back			0
@entity25 was unhappy with the way his side were playing and opted for a more cautious approach @entity20 , pictured surrounded by players at @entity64 , seems to have been reined back by @entity102 with the attacking talent @entity102 brought in last summer adding to the likes of @entity73 , @entity139 and @entity140 already at the club , he was always going to have a conundrum			1
but despite @entity20 's form out wide and starting moves further back , coupled with @entity146 's eagerness to play , his next position to test out was up front			2
the counter attacking display at @entity150 was perfect for his talents as an out and out striker			0
his goal may have convinced his boss that this was a method to test in the future			0
of course , @entity20 's versatility should not be disregarded			2
he was loved by @entity158 in @entity11 for his ability to operate out wide to compliment @entity160 and @entity161 in a 4 - 4 - 2 , or testing the opposition centrally with his box - to - box runs in a 4 - 3 - 3			1
but his move from a withdrawn midfield role , to a brief spell at wing back to up top this season has been bizarre from @entity102 , despite fans catching a glimpse of his talents when given the space to run			0
injuries disrupted @entity20 in december , while @entity102 's new - look cautious @entity12 kept grinding out wins			1
his return to the starting line up against @entity76 saw him struggle more than ever in the role of a striker			0
injuries have disrupted his season , only recently returning to the starting line up @entity20 struggled at @entity182 ( right ) despite seeing plenty of the ball and played further up field at @entity64 ( l ) @entity20 was substituted against @entity64 after flattering deceive as a striker fans chanted ' 4 - 4 - 2 ' during @entity12 's win against @entity64 last weekend , obviously eager to see @entity20 on the ball on the wing rather than wasting his talents away from the action			1
the @entity194 boss has since revealed that the formation leaves him ' twitching his ass ' , though that did n't refrain him from opting for the diamond at @entity182 , much to the delight of supporters			0
however , the @entity20 we saw at @entity201 was not the player every one knows he can be			2
this was a player bereft of confidence ( even @entity207 was taking the corners ) , eager to make an impact on the game but his decision making was way off			0
@entity102 was unhappy with his side 's performance against @entity14 minnows @entity182 in a 0 - 0 draw @entity20 had five shots against @entity182 , one of which ballooned out of the stadium one of his five shots in particular was the subject of ridicule from the noisy home faithful , an effort from 30 yards which ballooned over the bar , and out of the stadium			1
perhaps @entity102 should have taken @entity20 out of the firing line in a game which obviously was n't going to suit his ability			0
perhaps a strong start masked over the fact that every player takes time to acclimatise in @entity44			0
but the speed in which the super-talented midfielder has gone from star of world football to the butt of minnows ' jokes will be worrying for @entity12 fans and @entity102 .			0

@entity12 drew 0 - 0 with @entity1 on friday night
@entity2 struggled - one of his shots ballooned out of the stadium
@entity23 winger was signed for £ 60m from @entity11 last summer
