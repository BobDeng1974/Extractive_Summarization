by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity3 ’s title clash at @entity4 could be moved as @entity5 at last finds help at hand from the @entity9 fixture planners			1
@entity5 has spent much of the year grumbling that the domestic programme handicaps @entity12 teams in @entity14 competition , while leagues in other countries move games on request to offer clubs more recovery time ahead of @entity21 dates			1
‘ maybe it does not matter what @entity12 clubs do in @entity25 , ’ fumed the @entity3 manager last month			2
as it stands , @entity5 ’s team are scheduled to play on a sunday before both legs of the semi-final			2
they face @entity47 at home on april 20 and @entity4 away on april 27			1
one of the @entity14 ties will be on a tuesday and the other will be on a wednesday , with the order to be determined on friday			0
63600 26262 53151 44095 57447 42005 rearranged : @entity3 's game against either @entity4 ( left ) or @entity47 ( right ) will be moved depending on the draw , the @entity9 will move either @entity3 ’s game against @entity47 at @entity55 or the trip to @entity57 forward to saturday			1
@entity5 will learn today the outcome of his improper conduct charge for going on to the pitch in the defeat by @entity62 last month			0
@entity5 denied the charge and attended a personal hearing yesterday just hours after sprinting down the touchline at @entity55 to pass on tactical messages to his players after @entity35 ’s goal against @entity33			0
@entity25 will await reports from the referee and match delegate before deciding whether to take any action against the @entity3 manager but the episode at @entity75 has done nothing to curtail his mobility			0
@entity5 was charged by the @entity78 because he twice stepped on to the pitch after @entity80 had been sent off in stoppage time			0
he was sent to the stands by referee @entity83 @entity84 will miss @entity3 ’s game at @entity86 on sunday and faces a race to be fit for the @entity21 semi-final dates after a scan yesterday confirmed he has a slight calf strain			1
unfair advantage : @entity5 publicly bemoaned that @entity92 had longer to prepare for their last - 16 clash			0
