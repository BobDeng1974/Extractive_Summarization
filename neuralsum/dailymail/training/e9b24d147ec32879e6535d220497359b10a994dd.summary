5 other things to do in @entity3			1
and she 's let us know what are her must - pack essentials			1
it has such cool little back room hidden away with a @entity62 in it , not that i 've ever been in it , i dread to think whats gone on in there ! but it 's great just to go and have a look			1
they also get some good name djs playing there which is right up my street			1
it ’s a lovely restaurant with a great atmosphere , they have live singers in there			1
it ’s a bar as well , so you can go and eat yummy food then relax on the terrace with a few drinks			2
i ’ve dj 'd here a few times and it ’s a great venue playing a mixture of house , @entity87 and hip hop			2
its pretty big and open late so if it ’s a big night you 're after i ’d suggest going here			2
this is such a lovely and chic place to hang out , its a little bit away from the port which is n't a bad thing			2
it has a chilled out day vibe and then when it gets dark the party starts with dancers and entertainers and its really cool to dance the night away under the stars			1
it ’s an outside rooftop bar / club and its a great place to start your night			2
the music is a mix of everything and is n't too loud so its a great sociable place to catch up with your friends before gong to somewhere like @entity114			2
the star was in @entity3 for the annual @entity2 special set in the popular holiday hotspot , but she has also been busy with other work commitments			1
the 31 - year - old recently launched her own clothing collection for e-tailer inthestyle.co.uk and was joined by @entity2 favourite , 24 - year - old @entity25 for the @entity124 celebration			1
speaking about her 26 - piece range , the model and @entity127 told @entity128 : ' it is full of key pieces and items you would see me wearing			2
i 'm really excited for people to see it			2
' the designer , who models the whole range herself , explained that she 's added a lot more colour and softer fabrics , as well as sharp tailoring to the collection			2
keen walker : @entity7 enjoys taking time out to walk along the beach and explore the local area the tropical - inspired range features an eclectic mix of dresses , jumpsuits , skirts and co-ord sets			2
speaking about her inspiration , she said : ' i always look to catwalks for inspiration and to fashion bloggers and some celebrities but once i see something i like , i tend to give it a little twist of my own , we do n't want to be a copy of anything else out there			0
' @entity7 , who cites her favourite designers as @entity168 , @entity169 , @entity170 and @entity171 and loves to shop at @entity172 , @entity173 , @entity174 and @entity175 on the high street , says she finds it hard to describe her personal style			0
' it 's hard to describe as i tend to chuck different styles together and if i like something i will wear it			0
i love keeping it chic with an edgy twist , ' she said			0
i love to go walking so i often put my trainers on and just head out of the hotel on a little wonder and see what ’s around			0
there ’s a whole other world just away from the port that is so cool.eating out			0
i love , love , love going for dinner on holiday			0
sitting outside with a glass of wine is a great way to kickstart your night			0
@entity3 has so many cool restaurants to choose from			0
@entity5 has a lot of well known pool parties , @entity202 has a big @entity204 party once a month which is a must to experience , i still find it mad that people spend a fortune on champagne to just spray it all over each other ! take a boat out for the day			1
hire a boat with some friends , take a picnic and just have a chilled out day on the @entity216			0
the port has a lot of designer boutiques as well as a lot of high street shops so you can get the best of both			0
its also a really pretty walk along the port and you can have a nosey at all the amazing yachts			0
my luggage allowance is always overweight as i find it impossible to pack light ! i take a mix of looser fabrics and try to add in a little more colour			1
i 've scrapped the wedges in the daytime now and much prefer a more relaxed look at the beach or at a pool party so i 'm always on the look out for flats with a either embellishment details or metallic @entity245			1
as i 've got older i really understand about sun damage so i 'm a factor 30 girl from now on			0
i tend to get bored if i sunbathe for too long as i 'd rather be doing something active			0
but you still need to remember to cover yourself from head - to - toe in @entity251 fabulous friends			0
a holiday is not complete with out some great company			0
i was lucky to have my best friend @entity254 with me in @entity255 recently and he makes me laugh so much			0
a holiday is a time to relax and chill so i love travelling with people who are n't uptight and are happy to go with the @entity258 and @entity259			0
i own my own brand of hair extensions and pieces called @entity263 and they are a life saver on holiday			0
no one wants to waste their time blow - drying their hair and when you 're away it tends to go a little bit frizzy so i take a selection of extensions and pieces that just clip in and out			0
