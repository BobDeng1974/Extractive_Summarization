by @entity0 and @entity1 a social media filter that can identify risky comments or photos and urge people to reconsider what they post could stop sporting stars from being embroiled in online scandals			1
the real - time monitoring technology has been developed for sporting clubs in a bid to stop players from posting ' inappropriate stuff ' on social media that can often tarnish a sport 's brand			1
former @entity18 player @entity17 was the latest @entity19 player to be disgraced after he was sacked earlier this month when a photo of him urinating in his mouth was published on social media			2
former @entity19 player @entity17 is the most recent sportsperson to court controversy on social media after an image of him ' bubbling ' was published on @entity28 earlier this month @entity30 - based company , @entity29 , developed the filter to pick up risky information on @entity33 and @entity28 and has the potential to alert a third party like a sport club administrator			1
the technology will focus on the ' indiscretion ' of sport stars but will also be implemented at high schools to try and stamp out online bullying			1
it will undergo its first trial at @entity30 's @entity44 next month			1
moderating tools can recognise risky posts that contain blacklisted words or phrases or if it is posted at a particular time of day , for example 1am to 5am			1
the @entity33 or @entity28 post is then automatically stalled while an alert is sent to the person about its offensive nature and asks them to reconsider posting it			1
costly : @entity19 player @entity60 's career was almost prematurely ended when after a long string of trouble , he told a @entity64 fan to kill himself on @entity65 last year the post can then be deleted , modified or the warning can be ignored			2
' there 's an optimistic hope that it will shift behaviours so players think about what they 're posting on social media , ' @entity68 , the director of @entity29 , told @entity75			1
' hopefully this will be a solution that deals with inappropriate stuff being put out there by sporting players			1

' we saw a need for clubs who are concerned about damage to their brand			2
you think about it , the sporting clubs are very positive about it , ' he said			1
' there ’s no big brother there looking at you , it ’s just monitoring and moderating			0
' developers are also working on an image function where skin - coloured pixels could flag nudity , or the shapes of weapons could be identified			0
this could then be used to target @entity65 posts and apps like @entity120			1
in 2013 , @entity121 joined the list of @entity19 players who have had explicit material of themselves posted on @entity28 the @entity126 player had two naked photos posted on social media , but no action was taken against him by his club or the @entity19 the technology already has risky key words programmed to help moderate , but sporting clubs or schools would be able to determine exactly what should be filtered			1
' @entity136 has now become the number one issue in schools			2
so it ’s more about teaching students about what they should or should not be posting , ' mr @entity68 said			0
' if a user is being called a particular name online , that keyword could be loaded into the system and then any post referencing that particular word would be filtered or blocked			1
' you can keep loading in more keywords , depending on what the bullies are saying or the victims are experiencing			0
' the technology , which developers say is teaching a computer to understand the mean behind human actions , took 2.5 years of research and development			1
