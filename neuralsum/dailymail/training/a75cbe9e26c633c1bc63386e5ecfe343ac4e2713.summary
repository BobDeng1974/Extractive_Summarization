by @entity0 @entity1 and his daughter @entity3 had always loved to sneak what they called ' stolen moments ' - whether it was an unplanned trip to the playground or splitting a big chocolate cookie			1
and when his ' savvy ' passed away unexpectedly and inexplicably on april 4 , he realized how crucial these moments had been , and how he wanted another little girl to be as happy as she had been			1
as @entity1 , a writer and producer in @entity14 , awaits blood tests that he hopes will shed some light on the cause of her death , he has decided to launch ' @entity3 's @entity20 ' - a fundraising campaign to pay for a hard - up family to give their own little girl a treat			1
his initial aim of $ 10,000 has been far surpassed and people who have been touched by his heartbreaking story have donated more than $ 48,000			2
missed : @entity1 has set up a fundraising campaign in the memory of his daughter , @entity3 ' all i wanted to do was show my wife there was a reason to go on , that there was joy in the world and , even in the most brutal moments , the world is still a beautiful place with amazing people , ' @entity1 told today , as he recounted his thoughts the first night after @entity3 's death			1
he hoped that the fundraising website would raise $ 10,000 that he and his wife @entity46 would then gift to a family who wanted to treat their own daughter , but who could not necessarily afford it			1
' i 'm feeling very powerless right now , ' @entity1 wrote on the website			0
' the only way i can handle this powerlessness , i figure , is with the power to give someone else joy			0
' with the donations continuing to grow , the couple has not yet decided who will get the money			0
' the only 3 requirements are that they have a little girl , that they very clearly love her , and that they do n't have the financial means to typically do this sort of thing , ' he wrote on the site			0
adorable : the little girl , known as ' savvy ' , did not wake up on april 4 and her family still does not know why missed : @entity1 ( with @entity70 , his wife and son ) said he had loved his ' stolen moments ' of joy with his daughter the donations beyond $ 10,000 will go towards a college fund for the girl , he told today			1
' we 're going to sit in a mall , a coffee shop , a restaurant or playground watch people a little while until we find a girl that reminds us of @entity3 , ' @entity1 said			2
he also said he would love to meet up the little girl and her family after they go on their adventure so that he can see their photographs and hear their stories			0
' let us live vicariously through their joy and know that if @entity3 had lived to that age , maybe we would have had that moment with her , ' @entity1 said			2
@entity1 and wife @entity46 , who is eight - and - a - half months pregnant , said they are hoping to be able to find a girl when they come more to terms with their grief , perhaps later in the summer			0
loved : he now hopes the fundraiser can allow another family to share a happy moment with their child happy memories : the parents are pictured together with @entity3 on the day she was born but for now , they are overjoyed with the messages that are flooding in for them over @entity115 as parents share moments of joy with their own children and use the hashtag # @entity120			1
' i will find a family somewhere - someone i have never met before and has no connection to anyone i know - and help them make a @entity128 , ' @entity1 wrote on the website			2
' in the wake of this tragedy , i 'm determined to create joy			0
' to donate to ' @entity3 's @entity20 ' , visit the website here .			0

@entity1 's daughter @entity3 passed away in the night on april 4 and her family still do not know why she died
when she was alive , they had enjoyed many happy and unexpected experiences together that @entity1 called ' stolen moments '
after her death , he decided to raise funds so that another family could enjoy a ' stolen moment ' with their child
the aim was $ 10,000 but it has already raised nearly $ *50,000*
the family say they will pick a child at random who reminds them of their daughter and give her the money for an experience and a college fund
