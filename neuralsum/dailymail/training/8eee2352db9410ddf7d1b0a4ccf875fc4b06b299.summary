by @entity0 published : 20:55 est , 23 november 2012 updated : 20:56 est , 23 november 2012 when orders for their award - winning pies took off , a family bakery business urgently tried to recruit more staff			0
they offered decent pay rates and a permanent job			1
the only skills boss @entity9 asked for were ‘ common sense and a work ethic ’			1
but what followed has left mr @entity9 ‘ frustrated , bewildered and shocked ’ and more convinced than ever that reforms to the benefits system ca n’t come soon enough			1
frustrated : @entity9 of @entity16 company in @entity17 , is struggling to get new employees to work in his factory and bakery due to a poor work ethic for it soon became clear that the recruits who turned up at the @entity24 in @entity17 were n’t interested in a job			1
ministers plan to bring in a @entity28 payment to simplify the benefits system to ensure those who take a job do n’t lose out financially			2
last night mr @entity9 criticised the way the current system rewards the workshy			1
‘ they do n’t want to work and more to the point they do n’t have to work , ’ he said			2
one young man lasted just two minutes into his first shift before he walked out			1
the company gave another 22 - year - old , who had been to prison , the chance to turn his life around			0
but after two weeks doing a packing job , he stopped coming in and decided ‘ he could n’t cope with working ’			2
another applicant was a middle - aged man who put on his cv that he had just served a long prison term for aggravated burglary , was a member of the @entity52 and suffered from a bad back			2
the company 's freshly made pies are sold in supermarkets and upmarket delis across the country ( file picture ) ‘ i assume he put all that down to make sure he did n’t get a job , ’ said mr @entity9 , 64			1
the pie company has seen its order book almost double in value since the spring			0
their freshly - made pies are sold in supermarkets across the country , as well as @entity70 , @entity71 and numerous upmarket delis and farm shops			0
yet despite a recruitment drive , their 34 - strong permanent workforce is slightly down on what is was six months ago			2
the only way the company has been able to fulfil its orders is by overworked staff doing even more hours than before			0
lazy : mr @entity9 criticsed the way the current system rewards the workshy management want to hire ten workers in the bakery and packing departments , but it is proving an almost impossible task			1
the unemployed of @entity17 – of which there are officially 18,100 – do n’t seem up for the job			1
mr @entity9 , whose father started the company as a butcher ’s in 1960 , said : ‘ i do n’t think this is a local problem , it ’s a national problem			1
we all know the system is wrong			0
‘ it would appear to be too easy not to have to go to work to earn a living and to pay the bills			1
how are they paying their bills ? ‘ from an employer ’s situation it ’s extremely frustrating			0
the work ethic is sadly lacking			1
’ mr @entity9 said he used local agencies to hire staff , who are given a pay rise and taken on permanently if all goes well after a short trial period			1
‘ i do n’t care what background they come from i just want good , honest hard - workers , ’ he said			0
‘ we are a family business and our staff are not just numbers , they are people			2
if the company is successful , they keep a job and we all prosper			2
’ however , @entity123 , the supervisor who sifted through dozens of cvs , said usually the raw recruits complain after a few days about having to do proper work hours			0
‘ they always seem keen and committed to the job and then we start getting excuses			0
all they need is to be willing to learn and do a hard day ’s work			0
‘ we tell them they have a future here and can move up the ladder , they just do n’t seem interested			0
’ it ’s not the first time the business has faced recruitment problems			0
mr @entity9 took on six @entity142 several years ago because vacancies were left empty and has been delighted with their work ethic			1
‘ the problem seems to be with the long - term unemployed , ’ he said .			0

@entity9 offers decent pay and a permanent job
all he asks for is ' common sense and work ethic '
but , the 18,100 unemployed people in @entity17 are not interested
one man lasted just two minutes into his first shift before he walked out
