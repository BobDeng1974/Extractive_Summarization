by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 06:42 est , 12 july 2012 updated : 03:00 est , 13 july 2012 a wealthy businessman has admitted spending 20 years posing as a distinguished @entity4 captain claiming he risked his life for his country during the @entity7			1
@entity8 , managing director of a @entity10 - based gas turbine company , boasted about being a veteran who served aboard @entity12 , a destroyer sunk during the @entity15 conflict with the loss of 19 crew			1
for two decades he turned up to memorial services decorated in medals and in full uniform , recalling stories about the ships he commanded - and even duped @entity25 hero @entity24 who he invited to open his firm 's new premises in @entity10 , in 2006			1
he also claimed he had served in two @entity28			2
however , the bogus seaman was not quite as clever as he thought he was			2
bogus : @entity8 is pictured dressed as a naval captain wearing medals from the @entity7 but a veteran noticed his medals were in the wrong order and one ribbon was upside down ( circled ) correct : these are the colours of the @entity4 service ribbon awarded to veterans of the @entity39 which go khaki , grey , white , red , khaki , but @entity8 had his upside down so the colours were the wrong way around his fantasy was exposed when an 87 - year - old veteran noticed he was wearing his medals in the wrong order and that one ribbon - awarded to veterans of the @entity39 , was displayed upside down			1
in reality , the most the father - of - three had done was to serve on a @entity10 tug - boat set to ' mop up ' debris left over from the @entity7			1
he was sent to the islands to relieve the crew of the @entity55 some three weeks after the invading @entity15 force surrendered to @entity58 forces			2
however , following a police investigation it has emerged that he will not face any criminal charges			1
despite admitting his deception , he has escaped with a police warning			1
the punishment has sparked fury among those he duped , including genuine war veterans and mr @entity24 who was invited to open mr @entity8 's business			1
duped : @entity69 , left , with @entity25 hero @entity24 , who attended the opening of his business believing the businessman was a decorated veteran it is thought @entity8 , a married 52 - year - old , may have been living his lie for 20 years before officers arrested him on suspicion of fraud and offences under the @entity79 1894			1
@entity8 was convicted of drink - driving in 2010 and , when applying for his licence back , told the @entity82 he was a captain			1
duped : @entity8 claimed to have been a @entity25 veteran , like hero @entity24 who served in the conflict despite admitting his deception , @entity8 escaped facing a court over his lies and was instead given a police caution			1
it was veteran @entity91 who noticed he was wearing his medals in the wrong order and that one ribbon - awarded to veterans of the @entity39 , was displayed upside down			1
mr @entity91 said he felt honoured when @entity8 approached him at the @entity96 in @entity10 , @entity97 , following a @entity99 parade at the city 's war memorial in 2010			2
the veteran believed he was talking to an officer and even asked a friend to take the snap of the handshake			2
@entity91 , a pensioner who rose through the ranks to become a petty officer on board a warship , said he felt sickened and ashamed at being duped by @entity8			2
he added : ' i do n't think that man would have lasted long during the war			0
' captains are responsible for their crew and their ship			0
back then , everyone was scared but you just got on with it			0
' i was shocked and disgusted when i saw the story in the @entity121 exposing him			0
he was certainly very convincing and had the gift of the gab			0
' @entity91 's disgust at @entity8 's claim was echoed by veterans across the country who had been waiting for the findings of the police investigation			1
@entity132 , honorary secretary of the @entity133 ( @entity10 branch ) , said he had been invited to an @entity136 dinner , adding : ' it was a disgrace what he did			0
we took him at face value and he lied to us			0
' exposed : @entity8 shaking hands with @entity91 who realised @entity8 had his medals displayed wrongly a set of ' dolphins ' , as worn by members of the @entity146 , was also sported by @entity8			0
both @entity4 and @entity148 sources said they had no record of @entity8 having ever served			0
after he was exposed , @entity8 was branded ' @entity150 ' - an abbreviation of the name ' @entity150 '			1
the name comes from a short story by the @entity155 comic author @entity154 , @entity156 , in which the eponymous hero fantasises about being a military hero			2
war : @entity12 which sank during the @entity7 in 1982			0
mr @entity8 claimed he worked on board following an investigation by @entity163 and the @entity164 , mr @entity8 received a verbal caution for fraud by false representation in relation to making a false declaration to obtain a driving licence			1
mr @entity8 , managing director of @entity172 , a gas turbine maintenance firm based in @entity174 , @entity175 , issued an apology to veterans through his solicitor			0
@entity179 said : ' mr @entity8 had no intention of upsetting or causing harm to any veteran			0
' if any veteran has been offended , it is very much regretted			0
mr @entity8 is genuinely sorry			0
' @entity185 , @entity186 , said : ' we advised @entity163 that the investigation , as presented to us , did not reveal sufficient evidence for this case to be referred to a crown prosecutor for a charging decision			0
' the investigation into mr @entity8 is now closed .			0

the imposter fooled servicemen - including @entity25 hero @entity24 - into thinking he had commanded ships
he escaped prosecution with a police caution after he tried to apply for a new driving licence under the rank of ' captain '
