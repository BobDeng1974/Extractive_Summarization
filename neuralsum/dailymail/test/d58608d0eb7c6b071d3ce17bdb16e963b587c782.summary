the baby , known as @entity1 , had been born at @entity2 in @entity3 , pictured , but died six months later with traces of cocaine in her stomach a six - month - old baby died with traces of cocaine in her stomach despite her drug - user parents being reported to social services five times			1
small amounts of painkiller and anti-depressant drugs were also found in the infant , known as @entity1 , who died suddenly in 2013 , after a lengthy stay in @entity2 in @entity3			1
now a review released today has called for a host of lessons to be learned after several agencies fell short in sharing information that could have highlighted the baby 's vulnerability			0
according to a report , @entity1 's family , who lived in @entity3 , were well - known to social services and had been reported five times amid concerns of alcohol abuse , domestic violence and child neglect			1
a school had also raised concerns about the way other children in the family were being brought up			1
@entity1 was the youngest child in a family of four children born to a mother aged 30 and a father aged 33			1
at the time of her death , her siblings were one , eight and 10			0
her parents came to the attention of social care unit @entity45 five times between 2008 and 2012			2
@entity1 's siblings ' school had already raised concerns that the two eldest children were overweight , staying off school and left to look after their baby brother while their parents stayed in bed			1
@entity1 was born 12 weeks early at @entity2 in january 2013 and was diagnosed with a number of medical conditions , including a heart murmur			2
she was kept in hospital for three months during which time there were ' several consecutive days ' in which she had no contact with her parents			2
after she was discharged from hospital and into her parents ' care , a number of community nurse follow - up visits were scheduled			1
but the nurse was unable to get access to the family despite visiting them three times in one week			0
a fourth visit was successful but later appointments were not kept			0
a day before @entity1 died in july 2013 , a health visitor went to the home but was stopped at the door			2
a post-mortem revealed the presence ' at very low levels ' of cocaine , tramadol and mirtazapine ( an anti-depressant ) in her stomach			0
police also found empty beer cans , drugs and a syringe on the premises and her mother admitted to the police that she used cocaine and cannabis in the home			2
because of a lack of evidence , a coroner ruled the cause of @entity1 ’s death was ' unascertained ' as it was ruled the traces of drugs , which could have come from the environment or through resuscitation attempts , were not considered to have directly led to her death			1
a post-mortem revealed the presence of cocaine , pictured , at ' very low levels ' as well as tramadol and mirtazapine , an anti depressant ( file picture ) the report said : ' whilst agencies had some concerns about the older children , they generally worked to single rather than multi-agency agendas and processes			0
' there was some evidence of good informal liaisons such as between the school and the education welfare officer , or the school and school nurse , but generally the level of inter-agency communication required to support a family with four children was not achieved			0
' @entity132 was a vulnerable child and a discussion between health professionals may well have highlighted important information about [ the mother ’s ] history of not engaging with health services in respect of her children and the shared information may have led to further action			0
' but @entity144 , which compiled the independent report , said it was impossible to tell if the death of baby @entity1 – not her real name – could have been avoided			2
chairman @entity149 said : ' predicting the likelihood of such an outcome for a vulnerable baby is difficult to achieve with any meaningful degree of accuracy			0
' it can not be inferred that child @entity1 ’s death was preventable , but there are lessons to be learned for all the agencies involved with this family about multi-agency working			1
” mr @entity149 said a number of recommendations had been made in the wake of the infant 's death to improve working relationships between agencies tasked with supporting vulnerable children and their families			0
the 10 findings made by the board included an assessment that the follow - up services by @entity1 ’s hospital and community health services were “ ineffective ” for a vulnerable baby in the care of parents with a “ very poor history of co-operation ”			1
the panel also criticised the lack of a multi-agency system for monitoring missed medical appointments , resulting in “ potentially significant ” signs of neglect being missed .			0

infant , known as @entity1 , was also found with two other drugs in her system
she was discharged from hospital despite her parents being drug users
the family from @entity3 were already well - known to local social services
