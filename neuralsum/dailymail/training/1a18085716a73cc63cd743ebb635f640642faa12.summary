wonder drug : a new heart drug has shown to cut deaths by a fifth and reduce hospital admissions thousands of lives could be saved by a new drug for heart failure that researchers claim outperforms the current best treatments			1
clinical trials for the new drug – currently called @entity12 – were halted early because of the ‘ emphatic ’ results delivered by the treatment			1
research on more than 8,000 patients found that it saved 20 per cent more lives than the current ‘ gold standard ’ treatment – the ace inhibitor enalapril			1
a co-leader of the trial , professor @entity21 of the @entity22 , said : ‘ we have what we believe is a much more effective replacement for one of the gold standard drugs for the treatment of heart failure			1
this is a major advance in the treatment of this terrible problem			1
’ heart failure affects almost 900,000 @entity35 , most of them elderly , and claims 140,000 lives a year			1
it causes symptoms of fatigue , breathlessness , increased heart rate and swollen ankles , and can lead to serious complications			0
it occurs when the heart can not pump blood around the body effectively , possibly following a heart attack			0
the body responds to the low flow of blood by producing hormones such as @entity54 and noradrenaline			0
but these hormones constrict blood vessels and actually make it harder for the failing heart to squeeze blood into them			0
over time , the constant production of these hormones further damages the heart , blood vessels and kidneys			0
@entity68 , the current treatment , works by blocking them , which slows or halts the progressive worsening of the condition			1
professor @entity21 said @entity12 has a similar impact but the twice - a - day tablet has additional benefits			2
‘ what this new drug does is simultaneously inhibit the bad hormones – like enalapril – but in addition boosts the production of beneficial hormones , ’ he told a meeting of the @entity79 in @entity80			0
‘ several of these stimulate the kidneys to produce more urine – to excrete sodium and water – and act to relax blood vessels			0
all of these actions unload the failing heart			0
by having this dual effect @entity12 had extra beneficial actions compared with enalapril and in this way improved patient outcomes			1
’ in the trial 8,400 patients with heart failure were given either 200mg of @entity12 twice daily or 10mg of enalapril twice daily – in addition to recommended therapy – in a bid to compare mortality and hospitalisation rates			1
early results published in the @entity110 showed that 914 ( 21.8 per cent ) of patients in the @entity112 died of cardiovascular causes , compared with 1,117 ( 26.5 per cent ) in the enalapril group			2
a further 711 ( 17 per cent ) of patients receiving @entity12 and 835 ( 19.8 per cent ) of those receiving enalapril died of other causes			2
this represented a 20 per cent reduction in death from cardiovascular causes and a 16 per cent reduction in death from any cause for those in the @entity112			2
improvement ? sicentists claim it will prevent more deaths than the current heart treatment @entity68 does the new compound also reduced hospitalisation for heart failure by a fifth , experts said			1
the ‘ emphatic ’ results prompted researchers to bring the trial to an early close after 27 months			0
another study leader , professor @entity138 of the @entity139 , described the findings as ‘ highly statistically significant and clinically important ’			0
the drug ’s manufacturer , @entity141 , plans to apply for a licence early next year , meaning @entity12 could be available in 2015			2
professor @entity21 said : ‘ compared with our current gold - standard bedrock treatment enalapril , @entity12 made patients live longer , stay out of hospital and feel better , fulfilling all our goals of treatment			1
‘ this is a remarkable finding			0
’ @entity152 , ceo of the heart failure charity @entity154 , said : ‘ heart failure is a major and growing public health problem in the @entity35			1
almost one million people in the @entity35 live with the syndrome but awareness of it is low			0
we welcome the results of large - scale clinical trials , especially those that might advance the medical treatment of such an under - invested area			2

@entity12 described as a ' major advance ' in the treatment of heart failure
@entity172 compared the drug with existing treatment @entity68
reduced deaths from cardiovascular causes and from all other causes
also reduced hospitalisation for heart failure by more than 20 per cent
