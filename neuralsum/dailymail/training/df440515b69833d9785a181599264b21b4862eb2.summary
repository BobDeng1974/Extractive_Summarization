the crowd control - type barriers went up earlier this month in front of the colourful beach huts on the promenade above @entity12 in the popular @entity14 resort			1
they were put up by @entity16 who cited ' safety concerns ' , and said the barriers would be replaced with permanent railings in the autumn			2
blighted : the colourful beach huts now have crowd - control barriers to stop people falling off the promenade the iconic beach huts enjoy dramatic views over rockpools , the sandy beach , and the @entity30 beyond the colourful beach huts enjoyed far - reaching views over @entity32 , the sandy beach and the @entity30 this picture shoes the view from above the huts before the council put up the safety fencing in front of them but chalet - owners say they were installed without consultation - and are spoiling their beautiful view			1
@entity44 , whose family has used one of the colourful chalets for 65 years , said : ' one of my great pleasures , one shared by many chalet users , is to hole up in the chalet on a miserable , rainy day with a cuppa , a book and the papers , gazing at that wonderful sight of the beach and the tide			2
' i know there are many things to worry about in this world but it breaks my heart to think the council has robbed us of that view and pleasure			0
' artist @entity68 , who regularly paints the view , said : ' it 's changed the whole aspect			0
for anyone who has a beach hut , sitting out on a deck chair all they will see are metal railings in front of them instead of the view they will have been used to for many , many decades			0
' it was a beautiful view , but now the railings look like crowd barriers			0
' the council said the tide and weather had reduced the level of sand on the beach in recent years , increasing the height of the drop between the promenade and the beach			2
before the railings were put up , users of the promenade managed to get along it without falling into the sea holidaymaker @entity100 , from @entity101 , is one of the hut owners who say their view has been ruined by the fencing the council says it plans to replace the temporary barriers with more permanent railings @entity108 , @entity16 's director of service delivery , said : ' we were keen to address chalet users ' safety concerns and took action to install temporary railings ahead of the last bank holiday weekend , which is viewed by many as the start of the summer season			1
' we plan to replace the temporary railings with permanent ones in keeping with the railings used along other parts of the promenade			0
