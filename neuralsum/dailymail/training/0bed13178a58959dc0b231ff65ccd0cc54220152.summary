by @entity0 published : 06:43 est , 8 november 2013 updated : 06:58 est , 8 november 2013 since ancient times , people have dreamed of becoming invisible and many fans of @entity4 have anticipated the day when they might be able to own a cloak that makes them disappear instantly			0
but they might be in for a long wait as scientists have admitted that most invisibility cloaks currently being developed actually make objects more visible			2
while researchers have worked out how to bend light around objects to make them temporarily invisible , there are major limitations to current technology			1
scientists have admitted that most invisibility cloaks currently being developed actually make objects more visible , rather than hiding them			2
pictured is perhaps the ultimate invisibility cloak - as imagined in the @entity4 film , @entity21 light humans see bounces off an object before it reaches our eyes			0
scientists are controlling the path of the light to make objects invisible , using cleverly - shaped pieces of glass and other materials , which are loosely described as invisibility cloaks			1
researchers have managed to make the light bypass objects they want to hide behind their cloaks , but still enable the light to reach a human 's eyes			0
when light goes through a cloaking device it disperses sideways and follows a certain path to reach the same point as if it did n't encounter any objects			0
this means an object inside the cloak seems to have disappeared			0
current cloaking devices are made out of a variety of materials - including planes of glass - and few of them look like the flexible cloaks worn by @entity4 or the massive ' cloaking device ' used in @entity60			2
scientists are working on bending light waves around objects with the help of various specially - shaped materials , returning the waves to their original trajectories as if there was no object there to block them , @entity61 reported			1
they have also found ways to deflect and reposition other kinds of waves , such as sounds waves used in sonar equipment			0
while these scientific advances are impressive and will no doubt lead to more breakthroughs , scientists at the @entity78 , said current invisibility cloaks have numerous drawbacks			1
perhaps the biggest problem to overcome is that the cloaks are usually limited to working against narrow ranges of wavelengths and types of waves , so a cloak designed to deflect microwaves would not deflect visible light			1
to try and overcome this problem , the researchers looked at how current invisibility devices scatter light waves			1
researchers from the @entity96 , @entity97 and @entity98 in @entity99 have explained how they use light refraction to render objects invisible using their ' cloak ' , which is actually a cleverly - designed hexagonal array of panels of glass although cloaks can make objects appear invisible within certain wavelengths , the scientists calculated that the techniques used for devices at the moment actually scatter more light than uncloaked objects			1
current invisibility cloaks essentially make objects more visible - not less , they said			1
@entity114 , an electrical engineer at the @entity78 and @entity115 said that by making an object invisible to red light , it can make it bright blue , increasing its visibility over all			0
assuming one looked at all wavelengths of light , one would actually see the cloaked object ' more than the uncloaked object it is trying to hide , ' they wrote in their study , published in the journal @entity132 most invisibility cloaks being developed at the moment are made from metamaterials , which can be artificial structures with special light scattering properties			2
a lot of cloaks are made from static materials to warp light , but in the future , they could be fashioned from dynamic components such as a network of electronic amplifiers that connect metal patches , to create an active and changeable surface			0
the use of such technology could make cloaks invisible over a broader range of wavelengths and lighting conditions .			0

@entity155 scientists admitted there are major limitations to current technology used in invisibility cloaks , which are often made of rigid materials
researchers at @entity78 said current ' cloaks ' are limited to working against narrow ranges of wavelengths and types of waves
to try and overcome this problem , they are looking at how current invisibility devices scatter light waves
