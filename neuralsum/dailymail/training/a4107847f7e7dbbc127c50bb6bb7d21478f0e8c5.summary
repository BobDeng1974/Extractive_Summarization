the women spread a black cloth across a main street and threw their full - body veils , known as @entity19 , onto a pile , sprayed it with oil and set it ablaze			0
as the flames rose , they chanted : ' who protects @entity3 women from the crimes of the thugs ? ' the women in @entity3 have taken a key role in the uprising against president @entity31 's authoritarian rule that erupted in march , inspired by other @entity33 revolutions			1
protesting : @entity3 women burn their veils during a demonstration demanding the resignation of president @entity31 in @entity10 open dissent : the brutal @entity3 regime has fired into crowds of protesters so this rebellion is a dangerous one for the women involved symbolic burning : the protest is a @entity46 tradition which call for help from the tribesmen as violence rages all around them their role came into the limelight earlier in october , when @entity3 woman activist @entity53 was awarded the @entity54 , along with two @entity56 women , for their struggle for women 's rights			1
the protest , however , was not related to women 's rights or issues surrounding the @entity62 veils - rather , the act of women burning their clothing is a symbolic @entity46 tribal gesture signifying an appeal for help to tribesmen , in this case to stop the attacks on the protesters			1
the women who burned clothing in the capital were wearing traditional veils at the time , many covered in black from head to toe			0
the protest today comes as clashes intensify between forces loyal to president @entity31 and renegade fighters who have sided with the opposition in demands that the president step down			1

yesterday the president called in the @entity120 ambassador , @entity122 , and told him he would sign a deal to step down , a @entity120 official said			1
the embattled leader has made that pledge several times before , without resolution , and the worsening violence on the streets makes it less likely that he will follow through on that pledge now			0
it was the first meeting between @entity31 and a @entity120 ambassador since @entity31 returned from @entity132 last month , said @entity134 spokeswoman @entity133			1

that reflected a reversal for the @entity120 , which up to then had backed @entity31 as an ally in its fight against @entity163 in @entity3			1
@entity133 said @entity31 confirmed he would sign the @entity165 plan for him to step down - a claim he has made several times this year but which he has them backed down from at the last minute , infuriating both opponents and former allies			2

' it 's not clear that that has been completely enforced on either side since then , but we do consider it a good step , ' said @entity133			0
' there is still some fighting going on			0
' the protesters marched through the streets surrounding @entity200 , a central crossroads where the uprising against @entity31 first began in february			2
' the people want to prosecute the butcher , ' the protesters chanted , and some held posters saying that after the death of @entity210 's @entity209 , it was time for @entity31 to ' listen to your people			2
' the shooting broke out between @entity31 's forces and renegade troops loyal to major general @entity216 , who defected to the opposition and whose forces protect the protesters			0
there have been concerns that the intensified fighting could undermine @entity120 and @entity132 efforts to fight @entity3 's @entity163 branch , considered by the @entity120 to be the most dangerous of the terror network 's affiliates after it plotted two failed attacks on @entity120 soil in recent years			1
