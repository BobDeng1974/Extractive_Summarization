by @entity0 published : 20:27 est , 8 december 2013 updated : 04:45 est , 9 december 2013 he has been denounced as sexist , racist and a political laughing stock			0
but unlike many other politicians , the outspoken mep @entity3 clearly does n’t take himself too seriously			1
after a year in which he has grabbed the headlines for outspoken comments about aid to ‘ @entity11 ’ and women being ‘ sluts ’ for not doing the cleaning properly , the 64 - year - old and his wife have posed for a self - mocking @entity16 card			1
@entity3 holds bongos in their @entity16 card and wife @entity19 does her best ' slut ' impression the @entity3 for @entity22 and the @entity23 , who quit the @entity25 @entity24 in september to sit as an independent , clutches bongos given to him by a music shop while his wife @entity19 is dressed as a ‘ slut ’			1
the photo , taken in the kitchen of the couple ’s house in a village near @entity35 , @entity22 , will be on cards posted to friends and family			1
mr @entity3 said yesterday : ‘ it ’s a little bit of fun and i ’m sure the photo will give people a good laugh			1
' we have done a few of these photo cards of ourselves over the years , but we only ever send self - deprecatory ones			2
' it would be terribly vulgar and naff to send a @entity16 card making us look good			1
’ and if there was ever any doubt about mrs @entity54 ’s backing for her gaffe - prone husband , this picture dispels them			0
referring to equine physiotherapist @entity54 , 52 , whom he calls ‘ commander in chief ' , he said of the festive photo : ' it was her idea			0
' @entity3 was forced out of @entity24 after he hit a tv journalist over the head with a conference programme he said : ‘ she said “ why do n’t we stick two fingers up at the b * * * * * * * ” and so we did this			2
it was fun to do			0
’ it ’s been an extraordinary year for the previously little - known politician who has found himself front - page news for his outlandish comments and behaviour			0
he already had a reputation as a ‘ sexist dinosaur ’ for comments about women needing to ‘ clean behind the fridge ’ , then he highlighted concerns about spending on foreign aid with a supposedly ‘ racist ’ speech about helping ‘ @entity11 ’ and he followed that up by his jokey announcement at a @entity24 fringe meeting promoting women in politics that ‘ the room is full of sluts			1
’ mr @entity3 , who has recently published his autobiography , was finally forced out of @entity24 after he hit a tv journalist over the head with a conference programme in an angry on - camera clash			2
relaxing at home , the former city investment manager said his wife ’s pose with dusters , a glass of red wine , curlers , cigarette in mouth , apron and bright red lipstick , was her best attempt ‘ to portray a slut			0
’ while he always enjoyed playing his pair of bongo drums			0
might some of mr @entity3 ’s critics take offence again ? well if they do he and his wife certainly do n’t care .			0
