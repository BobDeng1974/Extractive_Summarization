by @entity0 published : 06:42 est , 12 october 2012 updated : 07:27 est , 12 october 2012 a @entity2 farmer has become the first producer in @entity4 of @entity6 superfood wasabi			1
@entity7 is supplying the @entity2 's @entity9 - starred restaurants with wasabi stems - used to make a hot paste traditionally eaten with sushi - after successfully managing to grow the notoriously difficult to cultivate plant			1
the @entity15 - based watercress farmer 's customers now include @entity16 after his plant , which is grown in a top - secret location , began to bear fruit			1
hot demand : farmer @entity7 , seen holding a wasabi rhizome , is supplying @entity2 's @entity9 - starred restaurants with the super-hot stems growing wasabi , which is similar to cabbage and horseradish , is a difficult and painstaking process as it requires precise water flow and light conditions			1
the plant also takes two years to harvest			0
it grows naturally along stream beds in mountain river valleys in @entity34 , but until now has only been available in the @entity2 in powder or paste form from supermarkets			0
now @entity39 's @entity38 - which was this week named as the @entity2 's best restaurant - and @entity16 's @entity41 in @entity42 are among the exclusive eateries lining up to buy fresh wasabi from mr @entity7 , who runs a watercress farm near @entity46 in @entity15			1
rhizome : the oriental superfood is now flourishing at a top - secret location in @entity15 the farmer , who tried a variety of growing methods and waited two years to learn if any had been successful , has kept the location of his crop under wraps to avoid the attention of potential competitors when grated down the stem - or rhizome - is used to make the wasabi paste usually served with sushi , but mr @entity7 said his customers are using the plants to experiment with wasabi by adding it to sauces and meat and fish dishes			1
' because it takes two years to grow we had to wait to see if we had been successful , which is probably why it has n’t been successful here before , ' he said			0
' until we started selling the wasabi we had to keep it very secret to protect our rights and also because we were n’t sure what the results were going to be			2
' we are now producing about 100 rhizomes a week and selling them to chefs and restaurants who have been experimenting with ways of using it in their food			0
' the rhizomes sell for between £ 8 and £ 45 depending on their size			0
mr @entity7 , who is managing director of @entity89 and new firm @entity90 said : ' the company has been working with watercress for about 120 years and wanted to try a new crop			2
we knew about wasabi and wanted to try it when we discovered that the paste and powder that you buy in shops has less than 15 per cent of actual wasabi in it			0
' it was difficult to research how to grow it because no one has been successful in @entity4 before so we tried different methods			1
' we practised and came up with our own system based on the sawa method used in @entity34 , which is where the wasabi is grown in water on gravel			2
' i think it could take off as a product that individual people will want to buy as the interest in @entity6 food and sushi is steadily gaining popularity			2
' it could even be grown personally in back gardens in the future , not only does it have a distinct flavour but the plant is quite pretty too , ' the farmer added			0
