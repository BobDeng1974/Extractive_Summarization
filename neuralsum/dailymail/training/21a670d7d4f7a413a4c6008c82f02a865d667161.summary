disgusting : the players will now be disciplined by college staff and were made to sit through a sexual consent discussion ' they represent an ugly , corrosive form of misogyny that simply should n’t be tolerated in any level of society , and that ca n’t just be dismissed as yet another supposedly harmless juvenile ‘ joke ’			1
