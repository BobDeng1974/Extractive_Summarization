by @entity0 published : 08:20 est , 25 january 2013 updated : 11:24 est , 25 january 2013 a controversial new @entity3 app shows users of the social network which of their online friends are prepared to meet up for no - strings attached sexual encounters			1
bang with friends claims to help users ' anonymously find friends who are down for the night ' by pairing up any that are both attracted to each other			1
however , doubt has been cast over how anonymous the app really is , since it has an apparent loophole which shows prospective users which of their friends are already using it before signing up			2
bang your friends : a new @entity3 app claims to offer an anonymous method of finding which of your online friends are prepared to meet you for sexual liaisons logging into the app shows a screen filled with the profile pictures of your @entity3 friends of the opposite sex - it appears to be designed exclusively for heterosexual pairings			1
beneath each of the profiles listed sits a button labelled ' down to bang ' which users can click to indicate that they are sexually interested in the friend in question			2
clicking the button switches its label to ' awaiting bang ' but will not notify them of your interest			0
unless , that is , they are also users of the app and have also clicked the button beneath your face too			0
if that happens , then the app will send a notification email to the address listed on your @entity3 account informing you that you have a match			2
however , despite its promises of anonymity , the app appears to have a serious glitch that could cause serious problems for users who prefer discretion			0
like other @entity3 apps , when users sign up to the service it shows a screen asking them if they are sure , but also showing which of their friends are already using the app. for many users , the revelation that they are out trawling for sex over @entity3 could be the source of serious embarrassment			1
a second glitch seems to be that once users have indicated they are ' down to bang ' a friend , there appears to be no way to revoke it - the button no longer works once it has switched to ' awaiting bang '			0
not so discreet : this screengrab of the @entity87 app authorisation screen shows how pictures of any friend who is already signed up to the service are shown - which could be embarrassing @entity92 writer @entity91 described the idea behind the app as ' icky '			0
' unless you 're someone who believes ( almost certainly wrongly , by the way ) that your @entity3 friends are all dying to hook up with you , and would do so if only given the bright blue button to admit it , the app does n't really offer you anything you could n't already accomplish on @entity3 without it , ' she wrote			1
' how many people would really freely admit to wanting to hook up with a friend who would n't already have some indicator of interest ? should n't you already kind of know your chances with your @entity3 friends ? ' part of the grossness of " @entity109 " is the way it conceives of friendship as something you only do to get to , well , banging			1
' at the time of writing , around 2,500 people had signed up to use the new app. @entity117 contacted the developers for comment , but has as yet received no response .			0

bang with friends claims to ' anonymously ' discover which of your friends are up for sexual liaisons
however when users sign up to the app it shows them which of their @entity3 friends are already using it
