@entity35 's knack for capturing his subjects in unexpected , often tender moments			0
there 's the diptych of a grinning @entity41 turning the lens back on @entity1 , and the picture of a young @entity12 being made - up backstage			1
@entity1 's first really famous picture , @entity44 , shows an enraptured @entity21 and @entity46 locked in embrace			1
@entity48 : @entity41 turns the lens back on @entity1 in this 1984 diptych rock aristocracy : @entity1 got up - close - and - personal to music legends like @entity41 and @entity53 speaking to @entity54 in 2011 , @entity1 said ' this is one of the most passionate pictures i have taken			2
' it positively bristles with it			0
there was no doubt among those in the room that night that this was a couple deeply in love			0
it â€™s a beautifully warm photograph			0
it was 1974 , and the actors had recently wed for the second time after their first marriage ended in divorce			0
' @entity21 organised a 50th birthday party for her husband at the @entity72			0
' it was strictly no press , but i had a tip - off , so i gatecrashed			0

@entity21 and @entity1 cut the cake and kissed in a wonderfully tender moment			2
wonderfully tender : @entity1 gatecrashed the 50th birthday party @entity21 threw in @entity46 's honour and managed to capture their passionate embrace ' because i got the only picture , i ended up being practically kidnapped by another photographer who wanted it , ' @entity1 said			1

' she always looked glamorous , and managed to look classy as well , " he told the @entity54			0
