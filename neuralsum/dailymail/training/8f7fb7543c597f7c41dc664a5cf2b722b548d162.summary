by @entity0 more chilling details have emerged about the 17 - year - old honor student planned to bomb and shoot his way through a @entity6 high school to commemorate the 15th anniversary of the @entity9 massacre , authorities claim			1
@entity11 ’s plan to use pressure cooker bombs , @entity14 cocktails and multiple firearms including an assault rifle to kill his parents , set fire to a field and go on a killing spree through @entity21 was foiled tuesday by an alert citizen , police said , and those who know him are shocked			1
the woman who called 911 says she thought he was acting suspiciously , ' trying not to be seen ' and even appeared to be breaking into the storage locker where police began to piece together his horrifying intentions			1
court documents show that officers found seven firearms , 400 rounds of ammunition and three homemade bombs in the teen 's bedroom , and three more completed bombs , ball bearings and chemicals in the storage facility where he was arrested			2
@entity65 , who lives near the storage facility , told the @entity67 the teen was cutting through her backyard when she first noticed him			2
' he walked through the puddles when there was a perfectly good road he could have walked on , ' @entity70 told the paper			0
' it just did n’t seem right to me because we see people come and go with their trucks , and they do n’t come on foot and cut through people ’s back yards			0
' ' it was like he was blatantly trying not to be seen , ' she continued			0
' that ’s why i thought it was odd			0
' @entity11 took ' some time ' before opening the door , appearing to be breaking in , the vigilant woman explained			1
able to see into the locker , she noticed shopping bags and trash that ' did n't look right			0
' he then closed it behind him , cops said , and @entity70 called 911			2
officers responding to the storage locker around 7:30 p.m. immediately noticed a significant amount of bombs and bomb making materials , police said at a thursday afternoon news conference			1
court documents cited by the @entity67 say the unit was illuminated with several small lanterns , and littered with boxes of ammunition , a scale and red zinc oxide packages commonly used to make bombs			1
‘ if you can guess what i 'm doing , i 'll tell you everything , ’ he told investigators , according to @entity115			0
when told to guess what @entity11 was doing , the cop asked if he was making a bomb			2
‘ yes , ’ the teen replied , and then admitted to placing the bombs near a local elementary school that were uncovered when snow began melting last month , officials said			1
he then admitted to wanting to shoot the police officer but having only a knife in his possession when confronted at the storage unit , according to the @entity131			1
high school horror : the teen planned to terrorize @entity21 and kill as many people as possible , officials said officials declined to confirm at the press conference whether he intended to shoot the cop			1
further questioning led to @entity11 chillingly saying that he planned to kill ' as many students as he could ' before the swat team gunned him down , according to the @entity67			1
he also admitted to being fascinated with other school shootings and idolizing the @entity9 shooters , said police			1
@entity11 ’s arsenal included an @entity149 assault - style rifle , a .22 - cailber rifle and a @entity152 handgun , according to the paper			1
he planned to use the .22 to kill his family because it makes less noise than the other firearms			1

he also had made six bombs and had the components to make many more , police said			1

' @entity166 later said @entity11 ' intended to set off numerous bombs during the lunch hour and kill the school resource officers and set fires and shoot students and staff			1
' police found a notebook detailing minute by minute how he planned to carry out the plot – starting with gunning down his parents and sister before setting fire to a field to distract authorities while he stormed the school			1
the plan itself involved placing pressure cooker bombs similar to the ones set off last year at the @entity197 inside recycling boxes in the cafeteria and shooting the school liaison officer dead before he could stop the rest of the assault , he told police			1
it was apparently first written in the notebook june 24 , 2013 , and while the semantics of the terror plot were tweaked over time , the original idea remained in tact - to kill his family , the school liaison officer and as many students as possible , the court documents revealed			1
end of the line : the @entity159 storage facility where @entity11 was arrested tuesday night @entity214 : bombs were found in melting snow at this school earlier this year , and @entity11 admitted to making them , police said they also did not elaborate on how he was able to obtain the guns despite being a minor			1

' he ’s a real close friend of mine			0
he has a lot of things going for him , unfortunately he took a wrong path , i guess			0

@entity291 originally thought he was practicing some kind of sport , now she calls the actions ' disturbing			0
