and one @entity3 fan has taken that saying to extreme lengths by creating an astonishing 8ft stained glass window which illustrates the emotions of a die - hard supporter			1
@entity2 , 64 , of @entity16 , @entity17 , got the idea to create the window in his garden shed after fans protested when the club ’s stadium @entity22 was renamed the ‘ @entity22 ’ last november			1
@entity25 fans described the decision to use owner @entity28 ’s sports firm in the new name for the ground , where football has been played since 1880 , as a ‘ nightmare ’ and ‘ abysmal ’			2
mr @entity2 said : ‘ i saw the reaction of fans outside @entity22 when it was announced that it was going to be renamed			1
then i saw this guy holding a protest poster , which he ’d made out of felt - tip pen			2
‘ it said : “ football is my religion			2
@entity22 is my church ”			1
my idea came from that really			2
@entity39 , especially @entity3 , is a form of religion up here			1
‘ i saw some images on the internet and started to draw my own from there			0
it took about two months for me to draw and then create the window			2
’ mr @entity2 said he put striker @entity52 - a £ 9million signing from @entity55 side @entity54 in january - ‘ at the top as @entity8 on the cross and then the rest as the disciples ’			1
‘ it ’s all symbolic , but fun as well , ’ he added			0
@entity52 , who has made a huge impact since joining @entity3 , is revered on @entity62 after scoring 13 goals in 14 games last season , and helping the club qualify for the @entity67			1
top man : mr @entity2 said he put striker @entity52 - the club 's £ 9million signing from @entity55 side @entity54 in january - ' at the top as @entity8 on the cross and then the rest as the disciples ' support : mr @entity2 got the idea to create the window in his garden shed after the club 's stadium @entity22 was renamed the ' @entity22 ' last november mr @entity2 became interested in stained glass windows when he was a child but only began making them about 15 years ago while he owned the @entity84 shop in @entity85 , @entity3 upon @entity86			1
the football fan - who has also created a stained glass project based on the industrial revolution - sold the shop 10 years ago and went travelling to @entity91 where he met his future wife , @entity89 he added : ‘ it was about eight years ago that i started making stained glass windows seriously and devoted some time to it			0
it is still a hobby but i do sell a few			0
backlash : fans described the club 's decision to use owner @entity28 's sports company in the new name for the historic ground , where football has been played since 1880 , as a ' nightmare ' and ' abysmal ' ‘ i ’ve lived in the same @entity108 house for about 30 years and it ’s got quite a big garden , so i built a summer house there to make the windows			1
i work in a big hut at the bottom of the garden			2
’ ' i saw this guy holding a protest poster , which he ’d made out of felt - tip pen			0
it said : “ football is my religion			0
@entity22 is my church ”			1
my idea came from that really ' @entity2 @entity2 owned his cycle store for more than 20 years and expanded onto the site of a 16th century property next door			1
there was a 1,500 sq ft room above , which he turned into an art gallery			0
he added : ‘ the bike shop made money , the gallery did n’t			0
it was always more of a hobby			0
so , you could say i have an artistic background			0
‘ i do n’t know what theme i ’m going to base my windows on next			0
something beginning with ' r ' , so maybe romance ? ’			0
