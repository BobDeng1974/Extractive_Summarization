@entity0 , 28 , from @entity1 the founder of @entity3 has spoken out about her passion for fashion and how confidence in school helped her achieve her dreams			1
@entity0 , 28 , from @entity1 , started working in curvy fashion in 2010 and since coming on leaps and bounds she 's now been shortlisted for a @entity12			1
the size 16 fashion school graduate believes all women should be allowed to feel beautiful , no matter what their shape or size			2
in 2010 , while she was in her third year studying fashion business at the @entity20 , she launched her popular blog , trapped in a @entity22 , for women who often feel alienated by high - street stores			1
@entity0 faced her own potential hurdles growing up , but a strong support system meant she was always confident in her body image , business aspirations , and her love life			1
' i was always bigger than all my friends , ' she says			0
' but when , as a teenager , i realised i was n't like everyone else , i actually embraced it and found things that worked for my shape			2
i did n't have the usual problems that you hear of like bullying			0
i was always quite creative and fashion was always going to be my forte			2
i could lean on that when i was younger			0
' i had a strong representation of people who were like me around me from a young age			0
my mum was n't very slim but was always confident and creative - i did n't come from a family of stick thin people			2
' it just means my way of shopping if different from all my friends			0
i might have to do more digging or go to different shops , i know loads of people who struggle in those areas			0
' when i was working in @entity56 and was a size 16 , even a size 14 was hardly stocked i had to wear men 's jeans because it was so hard to get high quantities of bigger sizes - and that was only nine years ago			1
' now , though , you can go into a store much more easily to pick up a size 16 or 18 - bigger sizes are more readily available			2
' she may have had abundant self - confidence , but she could n't say the same for opportunities			1
' i struggled to get a job after university			2
' but my final dissertation was on the plus - size concept , and i realised there was n't a lot for plus - size women who love fashion ... so trapped in a @entity22 , and three years later , @entity3 , naturally came about			1
' i funded [ @entity3 ] through my savings for my masters through work in retail , such as @entity56 and @entity83 , and charity work			0
' the first one was held in @entity86 , then the @entity87			0
this year 's show saw her attend wearing a t - shirt declaring @entity103			1
it was supported by @entity105 which , @entity0 says , was a particularly proud moment			1
' it solidified that we 're doing something special , ' she says			0
' even if just one person gains more confidence as a result of @entity3 , i will have done my job			2
' ' @entity0 joined us as a panellist when we launched the first student design competition cut for @entity105 and helped us select the winning designs , ' says @entity120 , of @entity105			1
' her passion and desire to change attitudes saw us working closely with @entity0 while she organised the second @entity95 @entity3 and she 's proved to be a force to be reckoned with			1
' on the day of the actual show her slogan tee said it all			0
@entity0 is confident and passionate and strives to give bigger girls the voice they deserve and the fashion they crave			1
' this year , @entity0 launched an 8 - piece capsule fashion range , carefully created to suit the needs of larger women			1
@entity135 is already leading her celebrity fan base			0
this year , @entity0 launched an 8 - piece capsule fashion range - from @entity1 with @entity138 it consists of simple dresses with modern accents ( l ) her iconic fat is @entity145 t - shorts cost £ 25 ( r ) available on @entity146 , from @entity1 with @entity138 consists of simple dresses with modern accents like fringing and leatherette , coming in at £ 150 - £ 220			1
her iconic fat is @entity145 t - shorts cost £ 25			0
@entity0 's market research showed her the numbers on a clothing tag actually hold women back form shopping , so she 's ditched the sizing system			1
' it makes them think ' oh , it 's a 20			0
i do n't want to wear a size 20 ! ' she says			0
' so while my clothes go from size 14 - 26 , i do n't do size labels			1
' i 've taken into account all the things plus - size women consider when shopping , ' she says			0
' for a start , they actually fit , and i 've done away with traditional size labels - we have letters instead			0
i 'm hoping it might help break down barriers			0
' next year , @entity0 's remit is expanding to cover all niche markets - petite , plus - size and tall - to make her body - confidence mission even more inclusive she is also launching her first pop up shop in february			1
the @entity3 event brings together retailers , designers and consumers of fashion @entity0 's passion for fashion first saw her customising clothes for friends and family aged just 14			1
' it 's been incredibly hard work , but i 'm always left with an amazing feeling knowing that i put blood , sweat and tears into producing a brand i 'm completely proud of , ' she says			0
the volume of new plus - size lines coming out thick and fast from @entity206 and designer retailers alike have @entity0 excited for the future of curvy fashion			1
' it 's a new niche that 's busting out the seams - the plus - size fashion world is moving leaps and bounds			1
' @entity215 's new plus - size range is key because their target audience crosses over multiple fashion - conscious demographics			1
' @entity105 ' cut range is very different and quirky and worlds away from what @entity105 is thought to provide ; just basics and staples			0
' but @entity0 does n't think it always works , and companies should work hard to understand a plus - size shape			1
' i do n't really see [ @entity228 , who created a collection for plus - size retailer @entity230 ) as a plus - size person - she 's a 12 - 14 , and plus - size is at least 14 - 16 ... @entity228 's on the smaller end			2
' [ unlike most plus - size women ] she would probably be able to say that she can easily find clothes in " normal " shops ... ' there 's a lot of collaborations going on			1
they 're not all going to work			0
' she 's also passionate about bringing in fit models when deisgning a plus - szie range - rather than just grade up from a small pattern block			1
' @entity246 fashion , though , can really get it wrong sometimes			0
it 's good to stick to quality staples ... ' many of the plus size companies who have been in the business for a long period of time can go back to the drawing board			0
' it 's important to use better fit models who are a better representation of their customer			2
a lot of plus size people are busty			0
it 's important to bring in fit models			2
you cant be grading from a size 6 to 24			0
' for @entity268 's new fashion line she cut her clothes on a plus size model who wears size 14 - 16 and is ' quite busty '			1
