by @entity0 former @entity2 presidential nominee @entity1 will headline a fundraiser celebrating @entity6 governor @entity5 's birthday next month			1
@entity1 has let bygones be bygones and reaffirmed his friendship with @entity5 since the @entity6 politician cozied up to president @entity10 in the aftermath of @entity12 six days before the general election in 2012			1
the september 10 birthday bash benefiting the @entity6 @entity2 is the latest in a string of political events the high - profile @entity2 politicians have appeared at together this year buds again : former @entity2 presidential candidate @entity1 , right , and @entity6 governor @entity5 , left , have reaffirmed their friendship since @entity1 's defeat in 2012 to @entity10			1
the @entity2 politicians are pictured here at a town hall meeting in @entity25 a few weeks before the presidential election once rumored to be on @entity1 's short list for vice president , @entity5 's relationship with the former @entity29 governor was reportedly on the rocks after he was photographed with the president surveying the damage caused by @entity12 less than a week before the presidential election			1
@entity5 met @entity10 on the tarmac when he arrived in @entity6 on @entity36 and took an aerial tour of the devastated areas in the president 's @entity40 helicopter			1
at a press conference afterward @entity5 said he ' can not thank the president enough for his personal concern and compassion for our state and the people of our state			0
' ' good news for all of us is that the president could n’t have been better today , ' @entity5 said during his remarks			0
' he made it very clear to me today that getting @entity6 back to normal is his top priority , and it ’s my top priority , too			0
we had a good day			0
' officially , the @entity1 campaign stood behind @entity5 , and @entity1 himself never uttered a harsh word against the @entity6 politician			1
@entity1 campaign manager @entity64 even told the @entity65 that @entity5 did ' exactly what a governor should do			2
' but behind the scenes conservatives and @entity1 aides trashed @entity5 and blamed him in part for the @entity2 presidential candidate 's defeat at the polls the following week			1
' he went out of his way to embrace the president during the final week of the campaign , ' a @entity1 adviser told @entity79 the day after the election			2
' it was n’t necessary and it hurt us			0
' ' @entity84 , @entity85 , and @entity5 undermined the @entity2 message , ' the @entity1 aide said , lumping @entity5 in with two @entity2 candidates who lost their @entity89 races because of their controversial comments on rape			2
refusing to be the scapegoat for @entity1 's drubbing , @entity5 fired back that people blaming him in the media were ' know - nothing , disgruntled @entity1 staffers who , you know , do n't like the fact that i said nice things about the president of the @entity102			1
' ' i would n’t call what i did an embrace of @entity10 , ' @entity5 told reporters			2
' that ’s become the wording of it but the fact of the matter is , i ’m a guy who tells the truth all the time			0
if the president of the @entity102 did something good , i was going to say he did something good and give him credit for it			0
' it does n’t take away for a minute the fact that i was the first governor in @entity102 to endorse @entity1 , that i traveled literally tens of thousands of miles for him , raised tens of millions of dollars for him , and worked harder than any other surrogate in @entity102 other than @entity123 , ' he said , referring to @entity1 's running mate			2
still , @entity5 continued to be badgered by @entity2 in the weeks after the election for his contribution to the @entity2 's loss			1
at a @entity130 meeting just after the election , the @entity65 said @entity5 was overheard telling an attendee , ' i will not apologize for doing my job			0
' photos of @entity6 governor @entity5 meeting president @entity10 on the tarmac when he came to @entity6 to view the damage caused by @entity12 in 2012 and @entity5 's laudatory remarks about @entity10 's response to the crisis contributed to @entity1 's loss in the presidential election the next week , conservatives and @entity1 aides claimed immediately after the election whatever ill will @entity1 may have had for @entity5 directly after the incident appeared to have dissipated by the time he spoke out about his blistering electoral loss for the first time nearly four months later			1
' i 'm not going to worry about how @entity5 was doing what he thought was best for the people of his state , ' @entity1 said on @entity153			2
' i lost my election because of my campaign , not because of what anyone else did			0
' @entity1 had verbally forgiven @entity5 , but the former massachusetts governor publicly kept his distance from the potential presidential candidate despite endorsing him for reelection in his governor 's race in 2013			1
it was not until earlier this year during the @entity166 scandal that the two men joined forces again , coming together to raise money for the @entity130 , an organization of which @entity5 is the chair			2
they 've continued to appear at political events together since , including one last month in @entity173 and the upcoming event in @entity175 , @entity6			0
according to an invitation obtained by @entity179 , admission to the fundraiser honoring is $ 150 and entry to the private reception with @entity1 is $ 5,000			0
guests also have the option of giving the legal maximum in contributions to the @entity186 - $ 25,000 - to attend a roundtable with @entity1			0
instead of gifts , the political party asks that attendees bring an ' unwrapped children 's toy ' to be donated to @entity193			0
@entity5 enthusiasts who ca n't afford to attend the fundraiser can show their support for the second - term governor by paying $ 15 to have their name listed in the committee 's birthday card to him .			1

@entity1 aides and conservatives claimed after the 2012 presidential election that @entity5 was at fault for @entity1 's loss to @entity10
the week before @entity5 *welcomed* the president to @entity6 in the wake of @entity12 and *complimented* him for taking action
@entity1 never attacked @entity5 but he stopped *paling* around with him
the two reaffirmed their friendship earlier this year and @entity1 is now headlining a september 10 fundraiser for @entity5 's birthday
