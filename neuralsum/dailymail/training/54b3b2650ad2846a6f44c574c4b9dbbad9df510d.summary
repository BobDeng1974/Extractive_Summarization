besides gaining a badly needed win , the most pleasing aspect of saturday 's game for @entity2 was naming @entity4 in his starting line - up for the first time			1
it ’s been a long four months for the @entity8 since @entity4 damaged ankle ligaments during his very first week in charge			2
@entity11 predicted it would be a huge blow to his plans — he had even been considering @entity4 as captain — and nothing that has happened since has proved him wrong			2
@entity4 gets in ahead of @entity16 as he made his long - awaited return to @entity19 's first team @entity2 will be delighted that his most reliable midfielder is now back fit and available for selection following surgery , rehab and one appearance as a substitute against @entity26 last week , @entity4 was the man that @entity11 turned to in a bid to lift @entity19 from their lowly starting position of 10th place			1
it was n’t pretty and it had few of the thrills and spills that gave @entity33 its reputation as the @entity33 but @entity4 ’s calm influence will have been of huge comfort to his @entity42 ’s that rarest of species , an @entity39 midfield player who is comfortable in possession and has a great passing range			1
until now , @entity11 ’s @entity19 career has been like walking a tightrope without any safety net			2
so much has been made of the £ 158 million spent last summer , and a fearsome front four of @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 and @entity51 , that nobody appeared to have thought about the balance of the team			0
@entity4 is a natural ball - player who looked at home in front of the back four in his first start after injury the @entity61 midfielder protected @entity19 's inexperienced defence when @entity63 attemted to counter yesterday , @entity11 took his most significant step to steady the wobble , sacrificing flair and excitement for control of the game and three points			1
despite @entity19 ’s defensive crisis — all four of their senior centre - halves were either injured or suspended — he resisted the temptation to ask @entity4 to plug the gap at the back			1
instead , @entity77 was asked to move positions and @entity4 was told to do what he does best , sit in front of the back four , protect against counter-attacks and control his side ’s play			2
‘ i felt comfortable , being sub last week helped , ’ said the 33 - year - old			0
‘ i played centre - half in that game at @entity26 but the manager decided to swap it today			0
@entity77 ( @entity89 ) is left - footed so he ’s a more comfortable left - sided centre - back			0
’ @entity51 and @entity47 may be more fashionable , but @entity4 's return is crucial to @entity19 the @entity19 star was back in his favoured position after filling in at centre - back against @entity26 though @entity19 were far from their best , @entity4 did his job			1
he did n’t hare about crunching into tackles but his reading of the game meant he did n’t need to			0
they let us have possession but creating chances is the difficult bit when teams defend like that in numbers			0
we got the win in the end though			0
’ the only genuine chance for the visitors , hooked over by @entity113 , came when @entity114 and @entity77 failed to deal with a cross from the left			0
@entity4 emerged unscathed from a number of 50 - 50 challenges and , more importantly , was always on hand to receive the ball and invariably use it in the right way			2
@entity19 had 72 per cent possession and while they did n’t pepper @entity63 ’s goal , their control led to @entity50 ’s breakthrough midway through the second half			1
at times , you could see @entity4 directing with discreet signals to his team - mates , very much the senior figure taking responsibility			2
@entity4 waves to the @entity33 faithful after a successful return in the narrow win over @entity63 @entity77 , a left - footed player , shifted into defence , allowing @entity4 to do what he does best in midfield it rubbed off on the younger players around him , too			1
it was no coincidence @entity4 ’s return coincided with @entity145 ’s best game for @entity19			1
the left - back surged forward knowing he would receive the right pass at the right time , and nearly scored from one such foray , only to see his shot beaten away by @entity151			0
and after @entity19 had scored , when @entity63 were pushing for an equaliser , @entity4 tracked back to block a @entity154 shot			1
he is one of those players most appreciated when he ’s been missing			0
@entity11 appreciates him , and so does @entity156 , which is why he ’s walked straight back into the @entity61 squad to face @entity159 and @entity160 .			0

@entity19 win 1 - 0 at home to @entity63
@entity4 makes first start of the *season* at @entity33
@entity2 will have been pleased with his midfielder 's form
