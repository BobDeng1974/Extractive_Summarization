by @entity0 @entity2 ’s ‘ totally dysfunctional ’ leadership tonight comes under extraordinary attack from former @entity5 spin doctor @entity4			1
in an updated version of his sensational tell - all memoirs , mr @entity4 warns @entity5 has ‘ no clear idea ’ of who it is trying to appeal to and a ‘ great , steaming pile of fudge ’ instead of key policies			1
he says mr @entity2 , with whom he worked for years in the @entity21 , has ‘ managed to blend the worst of @entity14 ’s “ me against the world ” isolation with the worst of @entity17 ’s “ they ’re out to get me ” paranoia			1
the shadow chancellor has resisted all advice to concede @entity5 ’s mistakes during its 13 years in power			0
mr @entity4 concludes : ‘ @entity5 currently has no clear idea who its target audience is , no positive messages to communicate to anyone about why they should vote for the party , no policies which will persuade them , and is being run in a totally dysfunctional way			1
’ his latest explosive intervention will infuriate his former colleagues , who are this week seeking to shut down leadership speculation by launching a ‘ summer offensive ’ highlighting the differences between @entity5 and conservative policies			0
over the weekend , mr @entity2 launched an attempt to turn his ‘ weird ’ public image on its head , insisting politics should not be ‘ an ugly person ’s showbiz contest ’			2
bringing home the bacon : the @entity5 leader tried to confront his inability to match his camera - friendly rivals , which culminated in the above image of him struggling to eat a bacon sandwich he made a high - risk speech last week in which he tried to confront his apparent inability to match @entity70 ’s camera - friendly manner and poise – saying he hoped voters would look beyond ‘ photo opportunity ’ politics			0
opinion polls suggest that mr @entity2 is a drag on his party ’s fortunes and is way behind mr @entity70 on most ratings of leadership			2
mr @entity4 , in the paperback edition of @entity82 , his account of his years working for @entity17 and eventual downfall , published this week and serialised in the @entity84 , insists he believes mr @entity2 will go on to win next year ’s election			1
but having pulled his punches in his references to mr @entity2 and mr @entity29 in the original version of the book , in the latest chapters he is unsparing about what he sees as their mistakes at the top the @entity95			2
he says mr @entity2 ’s policy measures , such as a promised energy price freeze and rent controls , are ‘ populist enough but rarely stand up to scrutiny ’			2
mr @entity100 ’s , meanwhile , are so wonkish they ‘ go entirely unnoticed in the pub ’			0
‘ if @entity5 currently has central , underlying messages that it is trying to communicate to the electorate about itself , its policies , and its leader , the best you could say at present is that it ’s not quite coming across , ’ mr @entity4 writes			2
learned their lesson ? mr @entity4 said that shadow chancellor @entity29 has yet to persuade voters that @entity5 has learned from the past resistance : @entity2 and balls , pictured above , have staunchly resisted calls to apologise for @entity5 's legacy ‘ if the message is ‘ we ’re not the @entity116 or the @entity117 , and you hate them ’ , that may work up to a point , but it wo n’t do much for those people who would happily express their antipathy by voting for @entity122 or just staying at home , let alone those who hate @entity5 as well			1
' even the ‘ cost of living ’ argument – for which read " those @entity116 toffs have n’t got a clue what your life ’s like " – relies on the electorate accepting that @entity5 has some better appreciation of those realities			0
’ mr @entity4 says mr @entity2 and mr balls ‘ badly need to develop and stick to some underlying messages ’ that will make people positively want to back @entity5 next year			1
‘ the starting point is a simple one : " we ’ve learnt our lesson "			0
from @entity140 to [ disgraced @entity142 boss ] @entity143 , admit where the last government screwed up , and explain why next time will be different , ’ he urges			0
‘ that will also give @entity5 the licence to talk about the many good achievements of its time in office , and to point out that it ’s the @entity116 who are now blindly repeating the mistakes of the past , especially on the economy			0
’ he warns mr @entity2 that he is still surrounded by many of the same advisers who attempted to address mr @entity17 ’s ‘ image problem ’ during his troubled stint as prime minister			2
grin and bear it : after his attempt to turn attention away from his ' image problem ' , mr @entity2 was confronted with cartoons comparing him to @entity164 , of @entity164 and @entity164 fame , by the @entity167 's @entity166 , left they continually advised mr @entity17 to counter the negative perceptions of his character by showing a ‘ softer side ’ , mr @entity4 says			1
‘ @entity2 ’s advisers will tell him to be pictured doing the everyday things that normal people do to show he ’s not ‘ weird ’ ; they ’ll arrange opportunities for him to look all serious and statesmanlike to counter the perception that he ’s not prime minister material ; and conversely , they ’ll urge him to crack jokes with @entity182 or shed tears with @entity184 so that we can all begin to see the ‘ real @entity2 ’ , ’ he writes			0
‘ this will all be a colossal mistake			0
not just because it leads to bad photos with bacon sandwiches , but because the blatant artifice of the whole effort risks throwing away the most important commodity any successful modern politician must possess : authenticity			0
’ mr @entity4 advises mr @entity2 to present himself as ‘ a @entity195 or @entity197 - style outsider , the opposite of the carefully - manicured modern politician designed by a committee of @entity202 advisers ’			1
' blatant artifice ' : mr @entity4 warned mr @entity2 against taking image advice from @entity17 's old team he also urges the @entity5 leader to ‘ start involving , consulting and using the whole of his team – not just his small circle of like - minded advisers and trusted shadow ministers , but all of his shadow @entity216 , all his most talented backbenchers , and all of the variously talented staff employed by the @entity95 , 99 per cent of whom could currently be forgiven for asking themselves : ‘ should we all go home ? ’ ’ mr @entity4 ’s book dominated last year ’s @entity95 conference , lifting the lid on a toxic culture of spin and feuding at the heart of @entity5			1
he was forced to resign as mr @entity17 ’s special adviser in 2009 after he was linked to a plot to smear @entity116 @entity230 via an @entity232 gossip website			1
the emails included fabricated slurs about the politicians ’ health and private lives .			0
