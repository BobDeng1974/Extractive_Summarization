@entity0 : @entity1 , @entity2 , @entity3 , @entity44 ( @entity45 45 )			1
subs : @entity47 goal : @entity35 47 host commentator so that 's it from us			2
thank you for following our live coverage of @entity23 's 2 - 1 defeat at @entity0			1
join us again soon ! f / t : for @entity56 he 'll certainly have a lot to take from this match			2
he may be concerned how his @entity59 performed sluggishly in the first - half but he will be encouraged by the performances of many of his young starlets this evening			1
@entity45 was instrumental in their equaliser and was a constant menace to the @entity0 defence when he came on			2
his efforts should have been rewarded with a goal of his own however , when through on goal but @entity56 should be pleased with how the teenager performed			2
f / t : and breathe ... for a friendly that was entertaining stuff in the second half			0
@entity8 's goal was taken beautifully - beating five or six men before slotting home in injury time			1
if @entity80 had scored that people would be eulogising that strike for some time			0
f / t : that 's it in @entity85			2
the referee brings a close to an exciting second - half in @entity0 as the hosts grab a late winner against @entity23			1
@entity56 should n't be too disappointing with his young side though in their first pre-season fixture			1
@entity45 - certainly one to watch for the @entity59			2
91 mins : late drama in @entity85 ! @entity8 weaves his way into the box before wrong - footing @entity25 in the @entity23 goal			1
an exciting end to a entertaining second - half			2
90 mins : there will be three minutes of added time			0
86 mins : as @entity23 did in the first - half , it 's @entity0 who look the stronger with the last few minutes of this pre-season to go			1
81 mins : @entity106 is replaced by @entity25 in goal			0
80 mins : deja - vu for the hosts as they hit the bar again from a free - kick			0
this time it was substitute @entity113 who sees his effort cannon back off the frame of @entity23 's goal from 25 yards			1
79 mins : big chance for @entity23 ! the impressive @entity45 beats the offside trap but hits a tame shot at @entity1 in the @entity0 goal when through one - on - one			1
77 mins : the hosts make a triple change as goalscorer @entity16 is replaced by @entity17 while @entity12 and @entity14 are taken off for @entity13 and @entity15			2
72 mins : @entity0 make another substitution as @entity7 is replaced by @entity125			2
70 mins : the saying of a tale of two halves is an understatement here in @entity85			2
both sides are now pushing to take the lead			0

61 mins : @entity4 replaces @entity3 , while @entity10 comes off for @entity11			0
59 mins : whatever @entity56 said to his players has clearly worked with his his much changed team having come flying out of the traps so far			0
a complete contrast to the first - half			0
55 mins : close ! @entity0 nearly regain the lead when captain @entity6 see 's his free kick narrowly go past the @entity23 post			1
50 mins : he 's only been on pitch for five minutes and youngster @entity45 is causing the @entity0 defence all sorts of problems with his pace and trickery			2
an impressive showing from the winger			0
47 mins : what a response from @entity23			0
substitute @entity45 makes a beautiful run down the left wing before pulling a cross back for @entity35 tap home			0
the players have got underway here again in sunny @entity85			0
and as said @entity56 rings the changes with @entity33 , @entity39 , @entity25 , @entity31 , @entity164 all coming on			0
@entity165 / t : @entity56 will have mixed feelings going into the dressing room after that performance			0
understandably @entity0 have looked the stronger side but @entity23 increased the pressure towards the interval			1
@entity165 / t : @entity23 have started to look sharper in the last 10 minutes of the match , but trail at half - time to @entity16 's strike for @entity0			1
45 mins : chance ! @entity42 comes close to equalising for the @entity59 but his low effort is saved brilliantly by @entity1			1
having said that , @entity42 wins a free - kick 35 yards from goal but all @entity38 can conjure is a poor effort that @entity1 easily gathers			1
