leading psychologist @entity0 say ' extensive evidence ' shows that @entity2 is a quick fix with no lasting benefits people with mental health problems are victims of a ‘ scam ’ therapy that is wasting vast sums of money , a leading psychologist has warned			1
they are being misled because the short - term fix offered by @entity2 ( @entity2 ) does not have a lasting benefit , says @entity0			1
the most popular of the ‘ talking therapies ’ @entity2 aims to help people manage their problems by changing the way they think and behave to become more positive			1
it is frequently recommended for people with problems ranging from anxiety and depression to eating disorders			2
in the short - term , 40 per cent of those who complete a course of @entity2 , typically five to 20 sessions of up to an hour , are said to have recovered			1
but ‘ extensive evidence ’ shows that two years on , depressed or anxious people who had @entity2 were no more likely to have recovered than those who had no treatment , said mr @entity0			1
he said : ‘ as a treatment , rafts of studies have shown it to be ineffective in delivering long - term therapeutic benefits to patients with anxiety and depression			1
‘ while studies show that in the short - term - six to 12 months - patients who have received @entity2 are more likely to report themselves as ‘ recovered ’ compared to those who have received no treatment , these results are not sustained in the long - term			2
‘ @entity2 is largely ineffective for the majority of patients			0
it is in essence a form of mental hygiene			0
‘ however filthy the kitchen floor of your mind , @entity2 soon covers it with a thin veneer of ‘ positive polish ’			0
‘ unfortunately , shiny services tend not to last			0
@entity2 fails to address the root cause of many people ’s problems , which often stem from traumatic experiences during their childhood			2
the @entity61 has pledged up to £ 400 million on treatment programmes which mostly use @entity2 and it is recommended as frontline @entity64 treatment for many mental health issues			2
mr @entity0 , a chartered psychologist , author and broadcaster , delivered his argument to the @entity2 industry at the @entity70 in @entity71 this weekend			2
@entity2 , or @entity2 , is a talking therapy			1
it has been proved to help treat a wide range of emotional and physical health conditions in adults , young people and children			0
@entity2 looks at how a person thinks about a situation and how this affects the way they act			0
in turn actions can affect how a person thinks and feels			0
the therapist and client work together in changing the client ’s behaviours , or their thinking patterns , or both of these			0
he and other psychotherapists are calling on the government and policymakers to refocus funding into alternative talking treatments , such as psychodynamic therapy , which focus on addressing the root cause of people ’s cognitive problems			1
the @entity64 has been advised that @entity2 may be offered to patients with a range of conditions by the @entity104 ( @entity104 ) , the guideline body			0
it is free on the @entity64 after referral by a gp but not available in all areas and there can be long waiting lists			0
the cost of private therapy sessions varies , but it is usually £ 40 - £ 100 a session			2
many mental health groups welcome the shift in emphasis in recent years away from medication towards personalised therapy			0
but mr @entity0 says research shows @entity2 is no more effective than placebo in treating anxiety or depression he says proponents have ‘ mis - sold ’ the treatment to policymakers and the public , who are wasting their time			1
mr @entity0 says @entity2 has been mis - sold to policymakers because it is cheap			1
he is campaigning for treatments such as psychodynamic therapy - which focus on addressing the root cause of people ’s problems - to be made available instead ‘ @entity2 appeals to politicians and @entity104 because it is quick and cheap			1
‘ the therapies proven to work long - term , such as psychodynamic therapy , would not be so cheap because they require more sessions ’ he said			1
but , he added : ‘ working as a psychotherapist , i rarely encounter patients who have n’t been subjected to @entity2 , which failed to help them			0
’ the @entity144 was unavailable for comment .			0

@entity2 ( @entity2 ) is the most popular talking therapy
@entity0 argues research shows it does not have a lasting benefit
after 5 to 20 sessions those with anxiety or depression appear to recover
2 years later they are no different to those who had no treatment , he said
says proponents have mis - sold @entity2 to the government and policymakers
he is calling on the government to fund other types of treatment
psychodynamic therapy focuses on root cause of problems , he said
