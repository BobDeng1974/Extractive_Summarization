the explosion in ' text speak ' means many are now effectively using a different language			1
almost nine in ten parents and teachers say the abbreviated words and acronyms developed for speed when writing text messages have thrown up a language barrier between the generations			1
and three - quarters said they frequently had to ask children to translate the contents of a text or email			1
more than two - thirds of teachers also said the terms were now ' routinely ' cropping up in essays and other work			0
adults reported messages from young children are becoming incomprehensible to them			2
examples include a text message a mother received from her eight - year - old child who wrote : ' @entity37 can @entity36 at yard ? ' this translates as : ' mum , can my friend sleep over at our house this evening ? ' other popular words include rfd , meaning after , kwl , or cool , and churoo , or true			2
education experts yesterday warned schools ' ' toleration ' of the terms was ' eroding language '			1
@entity52 , of the @entity53 , said : ' children use text speak all the time			1
it 's incomprehensible to a lot of people but you 're never going to get rid of it			0
it 's a social phenomenon			0
' the problem is schools go out of their way to accommodate it when they should be promoting the full versions of words			0
' a lot of teachers say language evolves so you have to accept it			0
fortunately , [ education secretary ] @entity74 is introducing tests which are much more formal and based on @entity78 grammar			1
' tradition : @entity74 plans to encourage the use of a more formal type of @entity77 in schools almost a quarter of primary school children now go to school with a mobile , according to the survey of 500 parents and teachers for @entity90			1
this rises to 93 per cent of secondary school pupils , helping to embed text speak in common culture			1

the @entity115 inquiry heard the prime minister thought it meant ' lots of love ' , when in fact it means ' laugh out loud '			0
a recent @entity121 report on children 's media habits revealed texting is most prolific among 12 - 15 - year - olds , who send an average of 193 every week			0
this was double the amount on the previous year and more than four times the @entity129 eight to 11 - year - olds were sending 41 texts each week			0
another survey of @entity134 adults found three - quarters believed words such as ' quashed ' , ' raconteur ' and ' diabolical ' have become outdated because of texting			0
@entity138 ( @entity139 ) , vice president of @entity90 - which is sponsoring the @entity140 , an online spelling bee - said the latest survey suggested text speak was eroding academic standards			2
' the difficulty is that a lot of text speak is creeping into work that kids are doing in the classroom , ' he added			2
' spelling has become much more fluid than it used to be which , on one level , is good - but , on another , does n't help with academic attainment			0

parents frequently have to ask their children to translate text messages
education experts have warned against schools tolerating ' text speak '
