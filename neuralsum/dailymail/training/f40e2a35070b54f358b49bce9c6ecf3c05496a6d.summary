by @entity0 for @entity1 an interactive history project has breathed new life into an old treasure - trove of maps by matching them up to modern - day street layouts			1
the initiative , orchestrated by the @entity9 , unearthed and uploaded a huge trove of maps , which were made available to the public			1
anybody who matches up a number of landmarks on one of the old documents - such as a road , river or church - to points on today 's world map can add to the project , which now boasts more than 8,000 entries			1
while some of the maps show the pace of change - streets filling out , roads advancing and railways being built			2
however , many of the cities featured have still keep their distinctive character on a map			2

@entity36 and new : the above map shows the @entity38 and the boroughs of @entity40 and @entity41 as they were in 1733			0
the street layouts are in many cases the same - though there is more open space and no evidence of railways from the archive : the @entity50 map , taken from a 1733 survey by @entity52 , shows the still - familiar layout of central @entity50 's streets			1
the city was radically reshaped after the @entity56 in 1666 victoriana : modern - day @entity58 is overlain above with a map image from 1898 - where the location of prominent railway lines through the city can still be seen difference : the settlement is noticeably less developed in years gone by			0
the map extract is taken from a 1898 @entity66 book called ' our own country			0
description , historical , pictorial ’ invaders : this maps shows the south coast of @entity74 overlain with a map showing the invasion route taken by the @entity77 around @entity78 geological : the lie of the land is still substantially the same , as it would have been in 1862 when the map was published and also centuries earlier when @entity83 and his legions landed on @entity86 shores four score and lots more years ago : this map shows the modern layout of @entity91 in the state of @entity93 , where one of the bloodiest battles of the @entity97 civil war was fought , which has been overlain with a military map showing troop layouts on the day			2
some roads can be seen on both , while the large freeway , marked in orange , would not have featured famous fight : the map shows the ground where @entity106 led to @entity108 troops against their @entity110 foes in one of the civil war 's decisive clashes going through changes : this map of central @entity116 , taken from an 1874 edition , is again significantly less built - up than today - and major roads are narrower and less prominent relic : the map of the @entity122 city was taken from the 1874 book ‘ @entity125 ; a general dictionary of geography , physical , political , statistical and descriptive ’ edited by @entity124			0

@entity9 project asked *members* of the public to match old maps to real - world locations , with 8,000 done so far
*inevitable* march of *progress* from maps - mostly @entity138 - can clearly be seen as urban areas grew
but even in *rapidly* - developing cities such as @entity50 , some significant landmarks and layouts are the same
