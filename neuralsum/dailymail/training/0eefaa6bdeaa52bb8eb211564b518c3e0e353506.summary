it is rumoured that @entity2 ’s @entity1 will feature a virtually indestructible screen made of sapphire			1
and now the eagerly - anticipated handset ’s screen is said to be about to enter large - scale production later this month			1
to create enough of the man - made sapphire material , which will make screens that are scratch - resistant and flexible , @entity2 struck a deal with @entity13 in @entity14 , @entity15			1
here , one of the screens is repeatedly stabbed by a knife and emerges unscathed from the video trial which also sees in being bent and scratched with keys synthetic sapphire is a hard , transparent material made of crystallising aluminium oxide , produced at high temperatures			1
as the material is heated , it forms disks that can be sliced using diamond - coated saws			0
these round disks are ground into shape , and polished , to become glass			0
the technology is traditionally used in watch displays because it is thin , super-strong and scratch resistant			0
@entity2 already uses sapphire crystal in the @entity40 fingerprint scanner on its latest @entity41 and to protects the phone 's camera			2
as a result , sapphire glass could potentially replace @entity46 currently used in most high - end smartphones			0
the sapphire material will be manufactured at a plant powered by renewable energy , which has been built as part of the $ 578million ( £ 350million ) arrangement , @entity48 reported			1
it is claimed to be composed of thin man - made layers of sapphire , which enables the material to be flexible - giving it a change of withstanding knocks and falls that shatter other types of toughened glass			1
a @entity64 videomaker recently claimed to have acquired one of the screens - and subjected it to a barrage of abuse , from stabbing it with a knife and keys to bending and twisting it			2
in the video , the screen emerges totally unscathed - raising hopes is could lead to a far more resilient handset from @entity2			1
@entity78 , a popular @entity64 host claimed last month to have got the screen from well - known @entity2 leaker @entity80 , who recently made his own video showcasing the screen			1
in the video , mr @entity78 can be seen bending and twisting the screen			0
' i slowly realised there is absolutely no way i can break this display under my own power , ' he said			0
' the worst blemish on the surface was actually my fingerprint marks and the dust from handling it so much			0
' the glass is also extremely high - quality , mr @entity78 noted : ' there ’s absolutely no colour shift while looking through the sapphire glass			0
' @entity2 already uses a small amount of sapphire glass for the ' home ' button and camera lens in the @entity41 , but the rest of the current @entity1 front display is made of @entity46			1
the new glass display is ' paper thin , ' mr @entity78 said in his video			0
he showed that his screen measures 4.7 inches diagonally , which is in keeping with rumours that @entity2 will release two different - sized iphones this year : a 4.7 - inch model and 5.5 - inch one			1
reports claiming that @entity2 was experimenting with sapphire displays began last year , yet sources claimed at the time that @entity2 found the technology ‘ infeasible			2
’ in the video , @entity78 stands on the thin screen and bends it			0
when released , it goes back it its normal shape , raising hopes the new handset will have an almost indestructible screen the screen is also shown being repeatedly stabbed by a knife - and emerging with no scratches , although it has not been confirmed to be the ' official ' screen that will feature in the new handset this was because sapphire glass is more expensive to produce than normal screens			1
but it appears that the sapphire screens will soon be manufactured at @entity13 ' new facility , which is expected to employ around 700 people			0
an @entity2 spokesman previously said : ' we are proud to expand our domestic manufacturing initiative with a new facility in @entity15 , creating more than 2,000 jobs in engineering , manufacturing and construction			2
' ‘ this new plant will make components for @entity2 products and it will run on 100 per cent renewable energy from day one , as a result of the work we are doing with @entity152 to create green energy sources to power the facility			2
’ last month , @entity1 maker @entity155 revealed @entity2 's new @entity1 could be the first to be made using its ' robot army '			1
the screen is described as ' paper thin '			0
it is claimed to be made from thin man - made layers of sapphire , which enables the material to be flexible , giving it a change of withstanding knocks and falls that shatter other types of toughened glass in the video , the screen survived having keys scratched across its surface - a common problem for @entity1 owners who keep their handsets in their pocket the firm has pledged to have a million robot workers by the end of the year - and ceo @entity180 revealed the robots , dubbed ' @entity182 ' , are in the final stages of testing			1
it is believed @entity155 will install 10,000 robots as a test and that lines dedicated to @entity2 devices will get first priority , according to @entity191			2
the website says @entity180 told a shareholder meeting that @entity2 would be the first company to take advantage of the new robot workers meaning that its next product - the @entity1 6 - will be manufactured in this way			1
each $ 25,000 ( £ 14,945 ) @entity198 can complete an average of 30,000 devices per year , it has been claimed			0
workers are seen inside a @entity155 factory in the township of @entity204 in the southern @entity206 province			0
the firm is believed to be installing thousands of robots to help build @entity2 's latest iphone @entity155 currently employs more than 1.2 million workers at its various factories across @entity212 and is said to be ramping up the number of human workers needed for the launch of the @entity1 , with 100,000 being hired according to some reports			1
in a bid to make sure there will be enough @entity1 6 handsets to meet demand , @entity2 has ordered a first batch of between 70 million and 80 million handsets , @entity217 reported			1
this would be its largest first production run ever and handsets would be expected to reach customers by @entity228			0
dozens of pictures have leaked online claiming to show @entity2 's @entity1			2
they all show a thin , curved device with distinctive white ' bars ' across the back			0
however , a @entity236 news agency has claimed that in fact , the finished product will look very different - and that it could even have a curved screen			0
a leaked image , posted on @entity241 by @entity242 in june , shows the difference in size between the current @entity41 ( left ) and the ' @entity245 ' ( left ) prolific @entity2 - tipster , @entity80 , has got his hands on leaked images of the front and back of a possible @entity2 lcd backlight panel that measures 5.5 inches ( 14cm )			2
the photos suggest @entity2 is already producing components for its anticipated 5.5 - inch phone			2

report suggests sapphire screen for @entity1 is about to enter production
production of the material is set to begin at a newly - built plant in @entity15
screen is rumoured to be flexible and scratch - proof
last month , a video showed the *4.7inch* screen being bent , twisted , scratched with keys and even stabbed with a knife
screen emerged totally unscathed - raising hopes is could lead to a far more resilient handset from @entity2
@entity1 6 believed to come in 4.7in screen and 5.5in screen *versions*
