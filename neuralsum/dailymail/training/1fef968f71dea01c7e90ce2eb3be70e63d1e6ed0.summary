by @entity0 while many people blame their cellulite on poor diet and lack of exercise , one psychologist thinks it may be to do with repressed anger from childhood dreading getting into your bikini this summer because of your lumpy legs ? you 're not alone			1
eighty per cent of women suffer from cellulite - including svelte stars such as @entity17 and @entity18			1
a host of products and wacky gimmicks - from detox diets and green tea patches to miracle cellulite melting knickers - are out there which claim to tackle orange peel thighs			1
but , according to @entity29 psychologist @entity28 , it 's time to cast aside the magic pants , banish the body brush and book into therapy instead			1
she believes the condition - which occurs when the strands that connect the layers of tissue and the fat below the skin gradually harden and contract - is caused by childhood trauma , not insufficient exercise or poor circulation			1
she says our emotions find an outlet through physical symptoms and any childhood stress - such as having too many rules to obey - suppresses creativity and can cause cellulite later in life			1
it may all sound rather unlikely , but @entity28 is n't the only one who believes our emotions can leave such a visible mark on us			1
natural beauty expert , @entity56 , agrees : ' our emotional lives certainly play a part in the physical effects of our bodies			2
' the repression of feelings can also lead to more wrinkles ! i encourage all to be more open with your feelings to prevent these physical symptoms appearing			1
so , if we are to believe @entity28 and @entity56 , it 's time to abandon that @entity70 reserve , let it all hang out and not only will your thighs be smoother , but your face too			0
while there are plenty of lotions and potions out there to help you beat dimpled skin , they could be a waste of money @entity28 is n't the only one with ideas about the origins of cellulite - as the exact causes are not yet fully understood , theories abound			2
it 's commonly thought diet plays a major part : too much fat , salt , carbohydrates and not enough fibre may make you more likely to suffer from fatty lumps and bumps			0
some believe hormones may be to blame , as estrogen , insulin , noradrenaline , thyroid hormones and prolactin are part of the cellulite production process			2
others say our it 's all down to our genes			0
two of the main causes of cellulite are believed to be lack of activity and a poor diet containing too much sugar , fat and salt however , not everyone agrees with the @entity28 's findings			2
dr @entity123 , joint medical director at @entity125 of @entity126 , said : ' there are a number of factors which can contribute to the development of cellulite			2
' until more research is carried out , women should continue to focus on healthy diet , weight maintenance and regular exercise regime , and try not to fluctuate any of these factors too much and keep them consistent ' ' these do include weight gain and obesity but that is not to say that all women who are overweight will suffer with cellulite			0
' the broad categories of causes are : hormonal , genetic , environmental and lifestyle			0
some of these we can obviously change , but others not			0
' poor nutrition or crash dieting can contribute to cellulite on the thighs , buttocks and even the stomach			0
smoking has also been found to contribute , while not drinking enough water or maintaining a diet that is too high in salt can also lead to its formation			0
' but while stress ( particularly when coupled with an irregular , unhealthy diet and lack of exercise ) can be a genuine cause of cellulite , there has not been enough research to support the notion that low levels of creativity , or any kind of emotional strain , can be to blame			0
' and until more research is carried out , women should continue to focus on healthy diet , weight maintenance and regular exercise regime , and try not to fluctuate any of these factors too much and keep them consistent			0
' @entity181 have a combination of bladderwrack algae , caffeine , green tea , ivy and horse chesnut extracts which apparently work together to help drain toxins while you sleep the £ 50 @entity191 cream has a ' delivery system ' which claims to penetrate active ingredients deeper into the skin than rival creams the £ 43 @entity196 contains coffee beans - caffeine is said to help banish cellulite			1

@entity29 psychologist claims cellulite is caused by strict *upbringing* and too many rules during formative years
believes repressed emotions are expressed through physical symptoms
