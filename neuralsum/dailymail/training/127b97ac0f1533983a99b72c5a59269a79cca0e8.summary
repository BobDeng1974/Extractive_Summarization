but @entity6 and @entity5 's romantic tale is more unusual than most			1
after marrying for the first time in 1966 , the couple settled down to a happy married life before the tragic death of their sixth child left their relationship on the rocks			1
but despite their 1985 split , love really did conquer all for the twosome who remarried early this week on the same day , at the same time and in the same place as their first nuptials			1
happy ever after : @entity6 and @entity5 outside their @entity25 home after their second wedding wedding number one : the couple pictured at their 1966 marriage			1
they split up in 1985 speaking after their second wedding , @entity6 , 66 , who worked on the canal boats before her retirement , joked their relationship was a case of ' better the devil you know '			1
she said : ' my family lived on a working canal boat and we used to bring grain down from @entity47 to a mill in @entity49 and that ’s where i met @entity5			1
' he used to be there talking to the boat people			0
i had just turned 16 and we got married when i was 19			0
at the first wedding there was just my two sisters and his parents and uncle			0
' but at the second one there was quite a few , the room was packed and we had bridesmaids and page boys and over 60 guests			0
' she added : ' when we got married the first time i was pregnant with our oldest child @entity67 and she now jokes she is the only child who has been to both weddings			1
' it was nice though because my sister @entity70 was my bridesmaid at the first wedding and was a witness at the second ceremony			0
' it ’s a case of better the devil you know			0
@entity5 was always there for me through the years and we never lost touch			2
we stayed close because of the children and even lived over the road from each other			0
' but the couple 's path to true love certainly has n't run smoothly			0
in the intervening years , @entity6 enjoyed two 10 - year relationships with other men , while 66 - year - old labourer @entity5 had a long - term girlfriend			1
wedded bliss : the couple tie the knot for the second time in the same place and on the same day as the first early years : @entity6 and @entity5 spent the early years of their married life travelling @entity94 's network of canals following the end of their last relationships , the couple , now great - grandparents , decided to rekindle their 50 - year romance			1
' we decided to try again as a couple earlier this year because @entity5 was always coming around and helping out with my dog and garden , ' explains @entity6			1
' so he moved in to my house a few weeks ago and we decided to get married again			0
i wanted it to be at the same place on the same date because it would be special			0
' the couple , who have 12 grandchildren and six great - grandchildren , moved in with @entity5 ’s parents in @entity49 in 1966			1
they then moved to live with @entity6 ’s parents who had moored the canal boat in @entity118 , before returning to @entity119 in 1976			2
they did n’t get divorced until 1997 but stayed separate until january this year when they realised they wanted to get back together			2
signing up to marriage : the pair complete the ceremony at a @entity49 register office family : the couple have 12 grandchildren and six great - grandchildren - all of whom came to the wedding and they decided to give married life a second chance - much to the delight of their children @entity67 , 46 , @entity137 , 44 , @entity138 , 43 , @entity139 , 41 , and @entity140 , 32			1
@entity6 added : ' we had six children in total but the youngest died when she was two days old			2
i needed @entity5 to be with me but he was needed at work and that was the cause of us splitting up			2
' he was at the funeral but he had to rush off to work and that was the final straw for me			0
i had two 10 - year relationships but lived over the road from @entity5 from the 90s			1
' and earlier this year we realised he was helping out so much with my dog and my garden and doing my shopping that we should get back together			0
now i do n’t think we ’ll ever look back			0
' @entity5 , who describes himself as a jack of all trades , added : ' i did have another partner but knew @entity6 was always the one for me			1
' we stayed so close and were seeing each other a lot and have never been far apart			0
everyone was saying it was about time we got married again and it feels like we have never been apart			2

@entity6 and @entity5 , both 66 , first married in 1966 but split in 1985
the couple rekindled their relationship in january of this year
they remarried on the 12th november - the same date as their first wedding
