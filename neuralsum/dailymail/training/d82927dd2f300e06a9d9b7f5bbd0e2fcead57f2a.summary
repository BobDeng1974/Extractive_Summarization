many of the sea ’s most efficient predators spend their days lazily drifting along waiting for darkness - and their chance to hunt			1
@entity18 eels and porcupine fish that have been docile during the day suddenly spring into life			2
wide awake : as the sun goes down on the @entity5 , a porcupine fish ( pictured ) that has been docile during the day suddenly springs into life while small shoals of fish dart for cover underwater photographer @entity28 captured these images in the @entity5 off the coast of @entity6			1
' night - time in the sea is not scary			1
it 's very quiet , peaceful and mysterious , ’ he said			1
' i could only hear the sound of my bubbles of exhaled air and could see only what my flashlight shined on			0
' here a diver looks at a @entity42 dancer , a type of sea creature who was so named because of its whirling swimming movement and red colour which are reminiscent of the skirt movements of a flamenco dancer @entity50 ( left ) is a reef stonefish			2
it is a carnivorous ray - finned fish with venomous spines that lives on reef bottoms camouflaged as a rock			1
as its mean looks might suggest , it is the most venomous known fish in the world and can be lethal to humans			1
in contrast , basket star ( pictured right ) are a group of brittle stars related to starfish			0
they generally live in deep sea habitats and in the wild can live up to 35 years the @entity5 is a diverse ecosystem with more than 1,200 species of fish , 10 per cent of which are found nowhere else in the world			1
the coastal reefs are particularly rich and attract thousands of tourists eager to go snorkelling and scuba diving every year			0
mr @entity28 , from the @entity76 , said : ‘ if you get into the water just before the sunset , you 'll probably catch the sight of some marine inhabitants preparing to rest overnight while others are getting ready for hunting			1
the tassled scorpionfish ( pictured ) is a carnivorous ray - finned fish			1
when in shallow waters , swimmers may accidentally tread on them which may cause painful injury from their venomous spines the yellow boxfish ( pictured ) is bright yellow in colour but as it ages , the brightness fades and very old specimens will have blue - grey coloration with faded yellow			2
it feeds mainly on algae , but will also feed on sponges , crustaceans and molluscs the giant moray eel ( pictured ) can reach up to three metres ( almost 10ft ) in length and weigh up to 30kg ( 66lbs )			0
they sometimes hunt with coralgroupers so that they can enter narrow crevices and flush prey from niches not accessible to the groupers , in the only known instance of interspecies cooperative hunting among fish ' in the twilight , reef - dwellers seem to come out in larger numbers			1
big morays , which were hiding from the daylight in their cave residences , are swimming along the reef wall moving from one cover to another or between coral blocks and nearby			0
' eventually the evening shadows deepen so that you ca n't make out anything without a torch and real night comes			2
' this is the time for reef invertebrates			2
they are often hunted during the day by fish who are adapted for searching and rooting out these invertebrates from their shelters			0
’ the red lionfish ( pictured ) is a venomous coral reef fish that can grow up to 47cm in length and typically lives for 10 years			2
the fish has large poisonous spines that protrude from its body like a mane , giving it its common name of the lionfish the @entity151 trumpetfish ( pictured ) can grow up to 80cm in length and has a long , tubular snout and mouth that it can thrust forward to catch prey			0
it is a stealthy hunter that eats smaller fish and crustaceans and is a mostly solitary creature here another diver comes face to face with a masked puffer fish ( pictured )			0
the fish has what looks like a black mask over its eyes and a very unusual mating pattern			0
it will visit a grotto and leave thick sperm behind to produce a scent to deter predators he explained that during the night while their predators are sleeping , they have the opportunity to stretch their fins and go for a swim as well as forage for food			2
' their diet usually consists of organic waste accumulated during the day			0
and as a result of their work overnight the reef becomes much cleaner when the morning comes , ' he added			0
the giant freshwater puffer ( pictured ) is carnivorous and originates from the @entity191 in @entity192			0
it can grow up to 26cm ( 26inches ) long and can inflate itself with water or air when stressed and frightened			0
it feeds on smaller fish and crustaceans - but if kept in captivity needs to eat crunchy food so that its teeth do n't get too long the sea goldie ( pictured ) is a hermaphrodite			1
a male retains a harem of 5 to 10 females , but when he dies one of the females will undergo sex reversal and take the place of the missing male			0
@entity214 occurs at sunset , between december and february in the @entity5 the anemone hermit crab l ( pictured ) ooks scary and lives up to depths of 27metres , but it collects small sea anemones to place on its shell for self defence			1

underwater photographer @entity223 , from the @entity76 , photographed efficient predators at night
he described night - time in the @entity6 sea as ' very quiet , peaceful and mysterious '
the @entity5 is home to more than 1,200 species of fish , 10 per cent of which are found nowhere else in the world
