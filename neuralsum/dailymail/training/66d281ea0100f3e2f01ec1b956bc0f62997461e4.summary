@entity1 captain @entity0 has come up with a novel way of limiting the impact of @entity5 star @entity4 at the @entity6 - drawing a gun on him			1
‘ the only way of stopping @entity4 is with a gun , ’ said the @entity9 defender , in an interview with @entity1 sports magazine @entity11			1
‘ he is the attacker who keeps you awake when you play against him			1
i faced him three times with @entity17 and once with @entity9			1
when the game goes to one side of the field , he is alone on the other			2
@entity22 man : @entity0 joked the only way to stop @entity5 's @entity4 is with a gun ‘ despite recent injuries , he is a guy who will work very hard at the @entity6			1
’ @entity0 , who has 46 international caps for @entity1 , said he would love for the hosts to face @entity5 , @entity28 or @entity29 in the final at the @entity31 on july 13			1
‘ @entity5 would be a classic			2
or @entity28 , for a rematch of the 2002 @entity6 final			1
or @entity29 , since the @entity36 are also calling for a rematch after we beat them in the @entity40 final last year			2
@entity35 said the story would be different at the @entity6			1
’ when asked how a rematch with @entity29 might end differently , he said : ‘ suddenly @entity1 only win 1 - 0 , right ? ’ talent : @entity0 will be hoping @entity1 can stop @entity4 if they face @entity5 during the @entity6 the centre - back also spoke about his move from @entity17 to @entity9 and how his dream as a youngster was to one day play for @entity50			1
‘ when i arrived in @entity17 , i thought i would end my career there , or at least play some 10 years there and then finish in @entity1			2
' for me , i had reached the peak of my career			0
then came the great offer from @entity9			0
happy : the @entity1 players seemed to be in good spirits during a training session ‘ i have spoken to @entity50 , including last year when i was at @entity9			0
but there was never a concrete offer of a contract for me to sign			0
‘ my dream was to play for @entity50			0
when i was little i wanted to be like the striker @entity64			0
i started as a striker but then moved to defence			0
' when @entity64 played at @entity50 i started to have the dream of playing for the club			0
but today i can say that is no longer my dream			0
that is in the past			0

@entity0 claims @entity4 can only be stopped ' with a gun '
the @entity76 defender is likely to come up against @entity4 during the @entity6
the host nation are *favourites* to win the *summer* *tournament*
