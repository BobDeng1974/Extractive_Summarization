by @entity0 published : 16:47 est , 2 april 2013 updated : 17:02 est , 2 april 2013 an @entity2 mother has launched a petition urging @entity4 to produce party supplies featuring a black @entity6 after failing to find products themed around her daughter 's favorite doll			1
@entity11 was organizing daughter @entity14 's @entity6 - themed fifth birthday party when she discovered the only products available featured the blonde , blue - eyed version of the doll			1
surprised by the lack of black barbies represented in the products , the mother , from @entity20 , @entity21 , launched a @entity26 petition urging @entity4 to offer a more diverse selection of party supplies			1
@entity14 - whose fifth birthday is this week - told @entity38 that she wanted a black @entity6 - themed party because the dolls ' look like princesses and fairies , ' she explained			1
' they look like me			0
' but when her mother set out to find party supplies , she found that the only line offered by @entity4 included more than 35 products featuring images of the white doll			2
meanwhile , the sole indication of diversity was a brown - skinned @entity6 and a brunette - ' possibly meant to be a @entity56 , ' noted the mother - featured on a tablecloth and a handful of hanging decorations			2
so mrs @entity11 launched the petition , along with an accompanying video and letter explaining her situation and requesting the signatures of others			0
she explains in the video : ' this is about more than just my daughter 's birthday party - it 's about promoting diversity , inclusion and respect			2
' ' this is about more than my daughter 's birthday party - it 's about promoting diversity , inclusion and respect ' mrs @entity11 points out that @entity4 is far from racist ; in fact , the toy company sells black , @entity56 and @entity86 barbies and markets many of its products to young girls of color			1
but she notes that if a black girl wants to have a @entity6 - themed birthday party , she has no choice but to use products adorned with the white doll			1
she asks in the clip : ' is that really the message @entity4 wants to send in 2013 ? ' mrs @entity11 explains that the lack of diversity is not only disturbing in the modern world , but it can also negatively affect the image black girls have of themselves			0
lack of diversity : when the @entity20 mother set out to find @entity6 - themed supplies for her daughter 's fifth birthday party , she found more than 35 products featuring images of the blonde , blue - eyed version of the doll the petition website reads : ' featuring the white @entity6 so prominently on the party favors while relegating the " ethnic " barbies to near - invisible cameos sends a clear - and troubling - message to young girls ' on the website for her petition she writes : ' featuring the white @entity6 so prominently on the banners , cups , napkins , plates , party favors , and invitations , while relegating the " ethnic " barbies to near - invisible cameos sends a clear - and troubling - message to young girls			1
' ' featuring the white @entity6 so prominently sends a clear - and troubling - message to young girls ' the accompanying video illustrates the diversity of @entity6 fans			0
it shows a sequence of young girls from various ethnicities playing with the dolls and saying to the camera : ' i am a @entity6 girl			0
' at the end of the clip , a banner appears that reads : ' beauty comes in all colors			0
' and it seems mrs @entity11 is n't the only parent who has experienced difficulty with the lack of diversity in @entity4 's @entity6 birthday party supplies			1
some of the supporters of the petition have listed their reasons for signing it on the website			0
one such woman wrote : ' every little girl should see herself and be proud			0
' beauty comes in all colors : a video for the petition shows a sequence of young girls from various ethnicities saying to the camera : ' i am a @entity6 girl ' like any other girl : @entity167 - whose fifth birthday is this week - says she wants a black @entity6 - themed party because the dolls ' look like princesses and fairies , ' she explained			1
' they look like me ' another supporter said : ' as a parent of a child of color , it has always been important to our family to have toys that represent our child 's image			0
' when she contacted @entity4 , they apparently told her that it was up to product licensees to produce black @entity6 party supplies			2
still , she mrs @entity11 says she thinks that the company should play a more active role in ensuring there is a diverse selection of party supplies on offer for consumers			1
says the petition : ' young girls of color have birthdays , and young girls of color love @entity6			0
so why only offer party supplies very prominently featuring one , white @entity6 ? ' watch : @entity206 petitions @entity4 for @entity6 of color party supplies			2

@entity11 was organizing daughter @entity14 's @entity6 - themed fifth birthday party when she discovered the only products available featured the blonde , blue - eyed version of the doll
the mother , from @entity20 , @entity21 , launched a @entity26 petition urging @entity4 to offer a more diverse selection of party supplies . it has since amassed over 3,000 signatures
