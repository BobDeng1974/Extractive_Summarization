appalled : @entity0 on the findings of a report into the deaths of up to 1,200 people because of poor care in hospitals run by the @entity8 trust hundreds of hospital patients died in the biggest @entity12 scandal in living memory because of a box - ticking culture and a failure of compassion , a damning official report will say today			1
@entity0 is appalled by the findings of a long - awaited report into the deaths of up to 1,200 people between 2005 and 2008 because of poor care in hospitals run by the @entity8 trust			1
it is expected to blame managers who cut costs and reduced staffing levels in an attempt to hit @entity26 ’s ‘ efficiency ’ targets and win foundation status			0
the prime minister will respond to the findings by announcing the creation of a new chief inspector of hospitals , who will be charged with ensuring hospitals deliver good , compassionate care rather than simply ‘ chasing targets ’			1
mr @entity0 is expected to say : ‘ we need a hospital inspection regime that does n’t just look at numeric targets , but makes a judgment about the quality of care			1
’ the system will be modelled on that introduced in the early 1990s in education , where a chief inspector sends regular inspection squads into classrooms to assess all aspects of school life			0
ministers believe thousands of patients could be at risk because examples of poor care reminiscent of that at @entity56 and @entity57 are ‘ dotted around ’ the @entity12			1
mr @entity0 , who has taken the unusual decision to make a statement on the report to mps himself today , will offer ‘ a strong expression of sorrow ’ for the suffering of the families of patients let down by the hospitals			1
@entity69 sources said the report would identify a culture of ‘ metrics and league tables ’ in the way hospitals are judged as a key factor in the scandal			1
‘ we ca n’t tolerate a situation where hospitals are meeting all the targets , ticking all the boxes , and the reality is people are drinking water out of vases and sitting in their own excrement			2
‘ you ca n’t legislate or mandate for compassion , but we must try to find a way to make sure the @entity12 is absolutely focused on making sure people get good quality care when they are in hospital – one of the most vulnerable times of their lives			1
’ responsible for supervising : the report will make uncomfortable reading for @entity12 chief executive sir @entity111 the report into the scandal , led by @entity114 , was handed to @entity115 and the @entity116 yesterday			1
it is also expected to call for better training for nurses and healthcare assistants , and an overhaul of regulation to ensure poor managers are weeded out			2
it will make uncomfortable reading for the @entity26 front bench and for the chief executive of the @entity12 , sir @entity111			2
between august 2005 and april 2006 , he ran the @entity129 , which was responsible for supervising the hospitals			2
his tenure came during a four - year period in which between 400 and 1,200 patients died needlessly due to a catalogue of failings and appalling standards of care			1
sir @entity0 also helped appoint @entity138 as chief executive of @entity140 – which presided over the disaster – even though he had no managerial training			1
doctors in @entity144 at @entity84 have since admitted that the whole department became ‘ immune to the sound of pain ’			0
patients were shunted into corridors and neglected so they did not count towards a four - hour waiting - time target			0
@entity151 , a former adviser on health to the prime minister , claimed that the scandal at @entity8 was followed by ‘ one of the biggest cover - ups in public service history ’			2
mr @entity151 , who now works for the think - tank @entity158 , said a ‘ @entity162 of @entity12 elites , trade unions and stuffy medical organisations ’ were standing in the way of making the @entity12 more accountable to patients			2
' box - tick ' culture : @entity69 sources said the report would identify a culture of ' metrics and league tables ' in the way hospitals are judged ( file picture ) @entity176 : misdiagnosed in hospital the parents of one of the youngest victims of the @entity56 scandal are calling for a new inquest because they believe staff covered up their mistakes			1
@entity176 , 20 , died in 2006 from major internal bleeding which was not picked up by doctors in @entity84 ’s @entity144 unit			0
he had fallen off his mountain bike and ruptured his spleen			0
but he was diagnosed with a few fractured ribs and sent home in a wheelchair with a sick bucket			0
he died hours later at his home in @entity195 , @entity196			0
at an inquest in 2006 , the coroner returned a narrative verdict meaning no one was blamed			0
but it has since emerged that the coroner did not see a vital report			0
the report , by consultant @entity204 , concluded that the death was ‘ avoidable ’ and that there was a ‘ high probability that the level of care delivered to mr @entity176 was negligent ’			1
mr @entity176 ’s parents , @entity211 and @entity212 , are seeking to overturn the verdict and want a new inquest			0
mr @entity176 told @entity216 : ‘ had @entity176 died as a result of the accident i could have accepted it as his injuries were so serious			0
but @entity176 needed care and the @entity144 department at @entity56 was in meltdown			0
’ lawyers representing the trust deny there was a cover - up .			0

@entity0 is appalled by findings of a report into 1,200 deaths in hospitals because of poor care
mr @entity0 will make a statement on the report to mps himself today
