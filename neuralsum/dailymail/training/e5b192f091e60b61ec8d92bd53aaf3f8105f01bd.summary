click here to see our brilliant @entity1 , including a pitch map of @entity5 's all - action performance			1
@entity6 will be thankful for two things on sunday morning			0
@entity10 , it is the end of a difficult week and two , @entity8 plays for @entity12			1
the @entity13 , yet again , dug his team out of a huge hole with a breathtaking double as @entity12 twice came from behind to snatch a draw at @entity18			1
subs : @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57			0
@entity12 : @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity31 , @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity8			1
subs : @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74			0
referee : @entity38 @entity12 ’s defeat by @entity77 — not to mention the red cards and pending @entity80 suspensions of @entity65 and @entity62 — leaves @entity6 ’s men with a @entity83 mountain to climb , so the manager was looking for a response			1
and he would not have liked what he saw in the opening 20 minutes as @entity18 came flying out of the blocks			1
@entity18 thought they had taken an eighth - minute lead when @entity5 thumped a header from @entity45 ’s cross past @entity58 , only for the effort to be ruled out for offside			1
then came a moment of controversy when , from the resultant free - kick , @entity5 thought he had grabbed the opener			2
as @entity58 took the free - kick , he inadvertently touched the ball with his standing foot , and , from his second touch , the intentional kick went straight to @entity49			0
the @entity18 striker smashed an 18 - yard drive past @entity58 to send @entity29 into a frenzy			2
once more , though , referee @entity38 disallowed the goal			2
@entity18 players were incensed , supporters bewildered			2
why on earth was that goal disallowed ? @entity38 , though , was spot on with his decision			2
@entity114 rules state that a free - kick awarded to the defending team in their own box must be retaken if the ball does not leave the penalty area after the first touch			0
@entity58 ’s inadvertent first kick did not leave the area , meaning the ball was not in play			0
@entity8 's first goal came from patient build - up in the @entity12 half , followed by a penatrating long ball - see more in our @entity1 @entity5 's first disallowed goal came from a header which he powered past @entity58 , but he was several yards offside from the resulting free kick @entity58 stumbled slightly in his run up before appearing to give the ball straight to @entity49 on the edge of the box @entity58 had actually caught the ball with his standing foot , meaning that he had played the ball twice in the box , and had to retake the kick @entity5 finished with aplomb , but @entity38 had already stopped the game , and despite @entity18 feeling aggrieved , the official was right @entity58 's free kick was required to leave the box before the ball could be considered back in play - so by touching it for a second time , he prevented the ball from becoming live			1
@entity149 was correct , but the sense of injustice only served to spur @entity18 on as they continued with their excellent start			2
@entity58 then produced an excellent point - blank save to deny @entity49 , after @entity30 laid off @entity46 ’s 14th - minute cross			0
@entity12 were let off the hook again later when @entity149 rejected a strong penalty appeal after @entity46 ’s long - range effort seemed to hit @entity59 on the arm			1
@entity6 ’s side were rattled			0
and @entity18 finally took advantage in the 21st minute			1
@entity161 found @entity5 with a perfect through ball			2
@entity12 protested for an offside , but @entity149 could not save them this time as @entity49 — in front of @entity167 manager @entity166 — scored his sixth of the season			1
the champions were on the ropes , a shadow of the team that secured their second title in three years last season			0
@entity65 went close to an equaliser but his shot drifted wide of @entity34 ’s far post			0
@entity18 players surround the referee after seeing two goals disallowed inside a minute , but @entity38 stuck to his decision @entity5 , who was also denied early on by a brilliant save from @entity58 , can not believe how he still has n't scored @entity5 did eventually find the back of the net with a legal strike after 21 minutes , his fourth goal in three @entity19 games @entity65 and @entity60 look dispirited as @entity12 were outplayed by @entity18 in the opening stages @entity8 finished brilliantly as the champions scored on the break to level things up , despite @entity34 's complaints @entity167 manager @entity166 was at @entity29 to watch @entity5 , with the @entity18 striker in the frame for a rise from non-league football to the @entity167 squad within six years			1
@entity5 ’s form — saturday ’s was his sixth @entity19 goal of the season — has impressed @entity166			1
as ever , up stepped @entity8 to dig them out of a hole			2
@entity60 ’s punt towards the @entity13 was hopeful but what followed was sheer brilliance			0
@entity8 effortlessly pulled the ball out of the air , twisted and turned past @entity27 before finishing past @entity34			2
where would @entity12 be without the @entity209 ? his goal should have been the signal for @entity12 to take control			1
@entity65 twice failed to make the keeper work in good positions just outside the box , though @entity216 was lucky not to see a red card after lashing out at @entity66			0
@entity12 did not look comfortable as their defensive frailties resurfaced			2
@entity58 denied @entity5 after the @entity167 hopeful hammered a shot straight at the keeper			0
and @entity167 ’s no 1 produced an even better save to deny @entity49 from close range seconds later , though the striker was ruled offside			0
the @entity13 striker celebrates his 10th @entity19 goal of the season , although @entity18 believed there was a handball in the build - up @entity34 was adamant that @entity8 had controlled the ball with his arm in the lead - up to the goal , but it was allowed to stand @entity238 can not believe what he is seeing as , despite having the ball in the net three times , his side went into half time level @entity48 battles with @entity59 as @entity18 showed passion and quality against a @entity12 side badly lacking form @entity247 miles @entity18 109.3 67.9 @entity47 90 11.7 7.3 @entity30 90 11.0 6.8 @entity44 90 10.8 6.7 @entity12 108.7 67.5 @entity64 90 11.6 7.2 @entity59 90 10.9 6.7 @entity63 90 10.8 6.7 as if the first - half was not exhilarating enough , @entity18 boss @entity238 sent on @entity53 for @entity46 at half - time			1
and the entertainment continued during the early stages of the second - half , @entity65 , @entity66 and @entity64 all firing dangerous low crosses without finding a team - mate			0
@entity18 did not sit back either , @entity48 watching his drive from 16 yards fly inches wide after a deflection off @entity31 while @entity27 fired an effort wide			1
city fans were calling for @entity72 and they got their wish when he was introduced for sub @entity70			0
but @entity72 was helpless as he watched @entity18 regain the lead in the 76th minute as @entity49 turned provider , firing in a great cross and @entity31 put into his own net under pressure from @entity30			1
the @entity13 put his hands together as if to pray			0
indeed , his side needed divine inspiration			0
they nearly got it just two minutes after falling behind when @entity53 sent @entity8 clear with a poor header			1
the @entity13 cooly skipped past @entity34 , but @entity43 was on hand to clear his effort			0
@entity27 followed suit soon after , clearing @entity69 ’s header off the line before @entity34 saved @entity65 ’s follow - up strike			0
but just like the first - half , @entity12 were rescued by their sensational @entity13			0
latching onto @entity65 ’s excellent pass , @entity8 ’s control was exquisite as he slotted past @entity34 in the 83rd minute to earn a draw			1
@entity60 , who struggled throughout in the absence of @entity282 , climbs all over @entity49 , conceding a free kick @entity30 celebrates with @entity45 after his pressure caused @entity31 to head @entity49 's cross into the corner of his own net @entity30 congratulates @entity5 for his excellent performance after the striker 's cross produced the vital second goal for @entity18 @entity12 look shell - shocked , but they bounced back immediately through @entity8 to rescue a point at @entity29 @entity65 drives past @entity53 as the champions looked for an unlikely winner , having been behind twice in the game @entity45 tries what would have been a remarkable winner , but despite his excellent technique the ball sailed just wide			1

@entity5 has two goals disallowed in a minute early on
@entity5 eventually scored a legal goal to put @entity18 in the lead after 21 minutes
@entity8 hit back for @entity12 with brilliant finish in 32nd minute
@entity31 own goal puts @entity18 back ahead before @entity8 levels again
