by @entity0 for @entity1 and @entity2 in @entity3 for @entity1 and @entity4 for @entity1 fifteen tourists remain missing at sea and ten others , including two @entity8 , had to swim six hours to safety after a tour boat sank in rough seas off an @entity12			1
the @entity8 tourists were among ten passengers who survived the ordeal after swimming from the stricken vessel to a remote island where they were greeted by an erupting volcano and had to spend the night drinking their own urine			1
they are now recovering in hospital while a huge search and rescue operation scours a 250 mile stretch of sea between the islands of @entity26 , east of @entity3 , and @entity27 , where the boat went down			1
these are the first pictures to emerge of the tourists who were rescued when the tour boat went down in rough seas after hitting a reef between the @entity12 islands of @entity26 , east of @entity3 , and @entity27 among the ten rescued are two @entity8 and passengers from @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 and @entity39 as well as the two @entity8 rescued from the stricken vessel , which sank after hitting a reef in huge waves on saturday , passengers from @entity36 , @entity37 , the @entity41 , @entity38 and @entity39 have also been saved			1
however , 15 foreign passengers remain missing and the @entity45 confirmed that more @entity8 nationals could be among them			1
@entity12 officials said it was believed the boat was thrown onto a reef in rough seas and sank very quickly as it made the journey between the islands , which usually takes three days			2
@entity54 , a @entity55 survivor , said the boat started sinking slowly after its hull was damaged in the storm and said he and the other survivors had to swim for several hours to shore to save themselves			0
while six people managed to be taken to safety in a lifeboat , the others were forced to keep afloat for more than 12 hours in the water before taking action			2
he said : ' six people were in the lifeboat			0
the others climbed onto the roof of the boat , which had not completely sunk , ' he said , speaking from a hotel in @entity71 on @entity72 , where the survivors were taken after being rescued			0
the @entity45 said it was providing consular assistance to the @entity8 hospitalised after being rescued while ten passengers have been rescued from the rough seas ( above ) , 15 other tourists remain missing ' we waited until midday on saturday			1
we were five kilometres ( three miles ) from the coast - there were many big waves separating us from the coast			0
' people started to panic ... everyone took the decision to swim to the closest island , five kilometres away , where there was an erupting volcano			1
' he said they swam for six hours and arrived on the island , @entity93 , as the sun was setting			0
they spent saturday night there , surviving by drinking their own urine and eating leaves			0
on sunday , they attracted the attention of a passing boat by waving their life jackets , and were rescued and taken to @entity71 , he said			0
' i was really very lucky , ' @entity54 added			0
@entity12 police said they were not prepared to release the names of the others rescued until proof of identity could be ascertained â€“ as all passports , credit cards , personal belongings were lost when the tour boat went down in the dark			0
the vessel sank while travelling between a notorious 250 mile stretch of water between the islands of @entity26 , east of @entity3 ( pictured ) and @entity27			1
a total of 15 foreigners remain missing at sea after tragedy struck the boat had set out to sail to the tourist attraction of @entity27 , a drawcard because of the diving it attracts when seas are calm and because of the unique wildlife - the famous but fierce monitor lizards , also known as @entity27 dragons			1
the seas were rough throughout the journey and even on the island of @entity3 , hundreds of miles to the west , tourists were complaining of the high tides and strong winds			1
@entity27 is one of several islands which make up the @entity141 , a protected area that is home to the komodo dragon			1
the huge lizards can grow up to three metres ( 10 feet ) long and have a venomous bite			2
@entity145 relies heavily on boats to connect its more than 17,000 islands , but has a poor maritime safety record			0
two vessels sank last month in different parts of the archipelago as millions travelled for the @entity154 holiday , leaving at least 36 people dead			2
fatal boat sinkings involving asylum - seeker vessels trying to make the treacherous sea crossing from @entity145 to @entity159 are also common			0
but boat sinkings involving foreign tourists are rare , with accidents in @entity145 's booming aviation sector more of a danger for overseas visitors in recent years			0
however , it was on the northern reaches of @entity167 - some 20 miles west of @entity27 - that the vessel came to grief			1
police on @entity167 's main town of @entity71 said it was believed that the vessel had been thrown onto the reef by the weather , damaged by the coral , and had sunk within minutes			0
according to @entity177 , a search and rescue official in @entity71 who , like many @entity179 uses only one name , the boat sank at night on saturday			2
' @entity183 managed to rescue five of them alive later at night on saturday and then the other five were picked up by a sailing boat , ' he said			0
it is not known if the rescued @entity8 tourists are related , although one is believed to be male			1
@entity189 , head of the search and rescue agency in @entity191 , the provincial capital of @entity192 , said the boat was carrying 20 foreign tourists , four @entity12 crewmen and an @entity12 guide when it sank just after midnight due to bad weather			1
he said at least four ships were currently involved in the search and rescue mission			2
@entity200 , a search and rescue official , said the boat had sunk in the early hours of saturday , but it was not until saturday evening that those who were rescued were picked up			2
tourist vessels and local fishermen have been scouring the area for survivors today , but their efforts have been hampered by dusk which has started to fall in the region			0
while ten people have been rescued , the fate of the remaining 15 is unknown and there are grave fears for their safety after being in the sea for almost 24 hours			1
the tourists were on their way to @entity27 to see komodo dragons ( pictured ) when the boat sank the @entity45 confirmed other @entity8 nationals may have been involved in the accident			1
