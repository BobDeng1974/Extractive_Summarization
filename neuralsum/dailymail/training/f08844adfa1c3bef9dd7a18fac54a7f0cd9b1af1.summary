military action against @entity1 is not working and hostilities must end urgently , according to @entity4 ’s defence minister			1
in a startling admission , @entity5 said the @entity8 tyrant must be welcomed to negotiations with pro-freedom rebels because airstrikes were failing to break the deadlock			2
he also raised the extraordinary possibility of the dictator clinging to power in a bid to thrash out a diplomatic solution			2
supporters : crowds shout slogans in support for @entity1 his apparent u-turn exposed deepening cracks in the @entity26 - led mission and were played down on this side of the @entity28			1
a source close to prime minister @entity30 insisted : ‘ that is not our position			2
’ a @entity35 spokesman said : ‘ @entity36 is not on @entity1 ’s side : the diplomatic , economic and military pressure on his regime continues to build			1
‘ whilst there has to be a political solution , @entity1 ’s brutal actions have stripped him of all legitimacy and he must go immediately			1
’ one military insider said : ‘ it ’s dispiriting when we are trying to keep up military and diplomatic pressure on @entity1 and the @entity4 all of a sudden decide to sing from a different hymn sheet			1
’ coalition leaders – including mr @entity30 – have made it clear the dictator must go			0
ceasefire ? opponents of the @entity26 bombing campaign against @entity8 protest in front of the @entity57 in @entity58 but despite nearly four months of bombing raids against his forces and command centres @entity1 stubbornly remains in power			1
speaking in @entity63 , mr @entity5 said : ‘ we must now sit around a table			0
we will stop bombing as soon as the @entity8 start talking to one another and the military on both sides go back to their bases			0
we ’ve shown there is no solution through force			0
’ negotiations between @entity75 and the @entity76 , the rebels ’ de facto government in @entity79 , should not be conditional on @entity1 stepping down , he said			1
he added that the dictator could remain in @entity8 ‘ in another room of the palace , with another title ’			0
the development is significant because @entity4 and @entity85 were the driving forces behind the onslaught against @entity1 , after the dictator vowed to exterminate rebels who supported the uprising which began in february			1
last month @entity4 admitted parachuting weapons and ammunition to the rebels			0
u-turn : @entity4 defence minister @entity5 , left , said @entity1 could remain in @entity8 ‘ in another room of the palace , with another title ' millions of taxpayers ’ money has been spent on the military mission yet @entity8 forces continue to repel rebel attacks			1
@entity103 , international affairs editor for @entity4 24 television news network , said : ‘ it was always a question of @entity1 leaving			1
the @entity4 were so gung - ho at the beginning , and are more battle weary now and realise the military solution is not as easy as they imagined			0
’ @entity111 mp @entity110 , who voted against the @entity85 joining the mission , said : ‘ this seems to be the longest assassination attempt in history			0
the bombing of @entity1 ’s family homes is hardly within the terms of the @entity120 resolution			1
what we need is diplomatic negotiation – more jaw jaw , less war war			0
‘ the @entity4 position also does n’t easily square with the fact that they are dropping arms to the rebels			0
’ shadow defence secretary @entity131 said : ‘ some of these comments seem to add fog to this conflict			2
it is important our armed forces join allies to protect innocent civilians			0
’ @entity139 , @entity1 ’s son and heir apparent , claimed yesterday that @entity75 was already in talks towards a peace settlement with @entity4 , although @entity63 denied ‘ direct ’ negotiations with the regime			1
further strains are likely to surface this week when the ‘ contact group ’ , which brings together the countries allied against @entity1 , gathers in @entity146 on friday			2
the @entity149 said @entity85 troops carried out successful airstrikes on sunday			2
@entity153 jets destroyed an armed vehicle near the vital oil town of @entity156 in eastern @entity8 and a rocket launcher at @entity158 in the west .			0

diplomacy is the answer , says defence minister in ' u-turn '
@entity1 ' may be able to retain some power once troops pull out '
