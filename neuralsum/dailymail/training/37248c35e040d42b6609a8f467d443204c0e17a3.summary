former @entity1 captain @entity0 doubts @entity2 has enough time to prove himself worthy of a place in @entity7 's @entity6 squad			1
@entity2 was officially unveiled by @entity9 club @entity8 on thursday after completing his high - profile move from rugby league			2
the 25 - year - old @entity12 will have to wait until december for his debut as he recovers from a fractured cheekbone and eye socket and @entity0 fears @entity1 2015 may come to soon			2
@entity2 poses for the cameras at @entity17 at his @entity8 unveiling on thursday @entity2 chats to his new @entity8 team - mate @entity19 at @entity17 on friday @entity2 played for @entity1 13 times in the 13 - man code , scoring seven tries ' i do n't want to get caught up in all this hype , ' @entity0 told @entity25			1
' @entity2 has to come out and prove himself			0
the timeframe does scare me - can someone be fast - tracked so quickly ? ' doubt hangs over @entity2 ' best position in union with @entity8 viewing him as a back row , while @entity1 have identified him as a possible solution to their long - term problems at inside centre			1
@entity0 , who won 64 caps in a distinguished @entity37 career that ended in 2007 , believes @entity2 ' power game and offloading skills are best suited to the midfield			0
' @entity8 want him in the back row and @entity1 want him in the centre , ' @entity0 said			2
@entity0 ( centre ) was part of the @entity1 squad that finished runners - up at the 2007 @entity6 ' the danger is @entity8 may have the problems @entity49 had with his integration , whereby @entity51 started using him in the back row before realising he should be playing in the centres			1
' i 'd like to see him play at 12 because that 's where @entity1 could use him and the position where he could be a game changer in exactly the same way @entity60 is used by @entity61			0
' the problem is that @entity8 's two centres are playing some phenomenal rugby			0
' do they leave out @entity66 for someone who is as yet unproven ? ' @entity2 ' fellow league convert @entity66 has been in sensational form for @entity8 playing at inside centre @entity1 coach @entity7 is keen to let @entity2 settle at the @entity71			1
' obviously i 've spoken to him during the period when we knew he was going to arrive here , but i 'll leave him pretty much to bed in at @entity8 , ' @entity7 said earlier this week			0
' i 'm sure he 'll have one eye on our games , but i think he 'll need to get bedded in at @entity8			0

@entity2 *joined* @entity8 this week after switching from rugby league
@entity6 takes places in @entity1 in a year 's time
@entity2 *mooted* as either an inside centre or no 8
@entity0 worries @entity2 wo n't have time to adapt to union
