by @entity0 published : 11:43 est , 19 october 2012 updated : 05:41 est , 20 october 2012 they were allowed to use the corpses of executed criminals for dissection training			1
but when demand outstripped supply , surgeons at the @entity6 turned their autopsy knives on those who would n't be missed or whose families could not afford to bury them			1
after being cut up and studied , the bodies of murderers , robbers and the poor were discarded into a secret 19th century grave yard on the hospital 's grounds in @entity20 , @entity21			1
they discovered a mix of bones with extensive evidence of dissection , autopsy and amputation			0
there were skulls with their crowns sliced in two , bones wired for teaching , bits of tattooed skin , and even a slice of brain suspended in a glass jar			0
altogether , the team uncovered 262 burials , but believe they have found the remains of 500 people			0
@entity75 markers : after poring over hospital records , the @entity42 archaeologists were able to trace these pieces of tattooed human skin back to @entity21 grave robbers @entity80 and @entity82 notorious : @entity82 , left , and @entity80 , right , turned to murder in order to keep up with demand for bodies destined for medical research			1
surgeons then practised on the corpses of both men after they were executed criminal activity : the pair murdered a youngster known only as ' the @entity95 boy ' after abducting him from @entity96 , a crime which helped bring about the 1832 @entity98 after years of painstakingly matching bones and body tissue to hospital records , the gruesome find has gone on display in the @entity42 's doctors , @entity105 and @entity45 exhibition			1
in the 1800s , @entity21 was awash with aspiring surgeons , keen to learn their trade			0
this created a huge demand for bodies			2
well - trained surgeons were essential to the capital , then the most populated city in the world			2
yet the only legal source of bodies for dissection were executed criminals			1
unable to get a steady supply of corpses , respectable surgeons turned to unsavoury grave robbers who ‘ resurrected ’ newly - buried bodies from the city ’s graveyards to sell to medical and anatomy schools			1
it was such a lucrative business that some grave robbers turned to murder in order to keep up with supply			1
the exhibition includes a fragment of brain from @entity138 grave robber @entity137 , who along with partner @entity137 , resorted to murder to keep up with demand			2
it also includes an iron coffin from the vaults of @entity144 's church in @entity145 , which once closed was designed to be impossible to open			0
the coffin , would have been vastly expensive at the time , and reflects the fear people had of being dug up once that had been buried			0
horror : a rusty man trap , used in the 19th century to deter poachers , was among the tools of the trade for the ' @entity45 ' gory : the exhibition includes a fragment of brain from @entity138 grave robber @entity137 , left , who resorted to murder , while right , an iron coffin from the vaults of @entity144 's church in @entity145 , demonstrates the fear people had over body snatchers ouch : in the 1800s , @entity21 was awash with aspiring surgeons , keen to learn how to use dissecting chain hooks , left , and amputation sets , right , on dead bodies to advance their skills the tattooed skin of either @entity80 or @entity82 , two @entity21 grave robbers , is also on display			1
the infamous pair murdered a youngster known only as ' the @entity95 boy ' after abducting him from @entity96			0
when the horrific revelation of the case was revealed , public fears peaked			0
voluntary body donation seemed unlikely to meet surgeons ’ needs			0
equally no one wanted to be operated on by a bad surgeon			0
freedom : whereas only executed criminals could be dissected on a table like the one pictured , the @entity98 ruled that bodies ' unclaimed ' or ' friendless ' could be given up for dissection fear : the @entity98 was successful in putting the resurrection men out of business but left a long legacy of fear that falling into poverty would mean you 'd end up on the dissecting table ( pictured ) need : well - trained surgeons were essential to the capital , then the most populated city in the world in 1832 , the controversial @entity98 ruled that bodies ‘ unclaimed ’ or ‘ friendless ’ could be given up for dissection			1
again , it was clear that the burden would fall on the poor			0
the @entity204 met strong opposition in @entity206 , and while many mps supported the surgeons ’ call for cheaper training , and thought that the poor would ultimately benefit			2
in 1832 @entity206 passed the @entity98			1
the act was successful in putting the resurrection men out of business			0
it is estimated that 57,000 corpses were supplied during the first 100 years of the @entity98 ’s operation			2
99.5 per cent were from workhouses , asylums and hospitals , showing that the burden was indeed borne by the poorest			0
the @entity98 left a long legacy of fear – that falling into poverty would mean the state claiming your body after death			2
@entity230 undertones : the unmarked graveyard , in use between 1825 and 1841 , lay undiscovered until the excavation team from the @entity51 department stumbled across it by mistake in 2006 video : " doctors , dissection and @entity45 exhibition " click here for more ...			1

after being dissected bodies of murderers and poor were discarded into unmarked graves in grounds of @entity6
before 1832 @entity98 surgeons could legally use bodies of executed criminals
but demand outstripped supply so *illegal* bodies were sourced from grave robbers
would - be surgeons needed bodies to practise their skills on
@entity51 stumbled across graveyard by mistake in 2006
