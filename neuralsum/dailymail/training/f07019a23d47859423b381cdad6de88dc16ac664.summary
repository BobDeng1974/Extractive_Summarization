the employee has n't been identified nor has his relationship to the poster			0
tongue lashing : this @entity5 employee lost his job after this photograph was posted to the @entity5 facebook page and went viral however , some commentators are speculating the outlet is in @entity27 , @entity28			1
others claim it is just a joke and the shells were stale and headed for the bin rather than for public consumption			0

' this just makes me hungry , ' stated another			0
despite the risks of being caught , this is n't the first time fast food workers have gotten into hot water over questionable treatment of food photographed and posted to social media			0
@entity5 trials : @entity5 is n't new to controversy on social media , with the latest incident just one in a series of embarrassing instances of employees photographed playing with their food in april , a @entity61 worker posted photographs of herself licking a pile of mashed potatoes on @entity4 and was promptly fired by her employer			1
last year , three @entity67 employees from @entity68 were fired after images of them standing in two bins full of shredded lettuce were uploaded to their @entity4 pages			1
and in another shameful @entity5 image , a worker tweeted a photograph of himself urinating into a plate of nachos in august last year			2
