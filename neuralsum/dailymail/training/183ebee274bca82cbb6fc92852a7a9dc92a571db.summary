with standing room only in standard class , there are rows of empty first - class seats			2
but this could soon change , following fresh calls to scrap first - class carriages after research indicated many of the premium areas remain half empty in rush hours			2
critics insist the comfort of commuters , who pay a high price to stand , should come before the train companies ’ quest to maximise profits			0
the research by a newspaper focused on trains arriving at @entity33 stations @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 and @entity37 between 8am and 9am on three consecutive @entity38 typically had three first - class carriages and five in standard class			1
only about 50 per cent of first - class seats were occupied on these trains			1
less than a fifth of the first - class carriages were full or nearly full and some had only three or four people in compartments with 48 seats			2
in almost all cases , passengers were standing in standard - class carriages , which seat 80 people each			1
all but one of the train operators contacted refused to disclose their own figures on first class or failed to respond			0
@entity55 said its first - class carriages were , on average , 40 per cent full			2
@entity55 said on an average train around 40 per cent of their first - class carriages are unoccupied transport secretary @entity60 said : ‘ it is sensible to think about the mix of first and standard - class carriages on our railways and it is something we are looking into			1
' it is right to ask the question of whether it could deliver a better passenger experience			0
' equally , it is important to be absolutely clear that it is not a solution to the serious capacity issues we face			0
' transport secretary @entity60 said it was ' sensible ' to consider the difference between how busy easy carriage is when setting the terms of the train firms ’ contracts , the @entity60 and his department can specify detailed criteria which must be met if bidders for each new franchise are to be successful			0
this could include adding more standard - class seats at the expense of first class			1
@entity91 , of independent rail watchdog @entity92 , said : ‘ a balance needs to be achieved between the number of standard and first - class carriages a train has			0
‘ it ’s clear that where passengers are being squeezed into standard - class carriages while there are plenty of empty seats in first class , this balance is not being achieved			1
’ a spokesman for consumer watchdog @entity112 said : ‘ where there are overcrowded trains and still space in first class , operators should do what they have done in the past and be flexible and change the allocation			0
’ government figures released in july showed one in five @entity33 - bound commuters have to stand during morning rush hours			1
the service from @entity121 to the capital squeezes in nearly double the number of passengers it is designed to carry .			0
