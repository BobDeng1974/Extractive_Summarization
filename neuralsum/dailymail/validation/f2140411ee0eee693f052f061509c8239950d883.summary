it seemed like the ultimate feel - good story , a health fanatic who managed to ward off a terminal brain cancer diagnosis simply through eating well and using a natural and holistic approach to life			1
@entity8 blogger @entity7 shot to stardom on social media and gave hope to cancer sufferers worldwide after she revealed that she had prolonged her life despite shunning conventional medical treatment and relying on her own ' whole life ' concept			1
now , however , friends close to the mum - of - one have said that she may have fled overseas to avoid confronting claims that her remarkable cancer survival story is not all it seems			2
doubts over ms @entity7 's cancer survival story surfaced after it was revealed she failed to donate up to £ 151,000 in profits from the health and lifestyle app to charity			1
the blogger has also admitted that she may have been ' misdiagnosed '			0
friends say information surrounding ms @entity7 's original diagnosis has mysteriously begun to be ' erased ' in recent days but previously her story has been well documented			1
she has stated that her health problems began when she was 20 , when she experienced problems with her sight , memory and walking			0
a stroke followed and ms @entity7 was told that she had ' malignant brain cancer ' with just four months to live			1
two months into a gruelling chemotherapy and radiotherapy routine , ms @entity7 said one specific incident prompted a treatment ' epiphany '			1
after passing out in the grounds of a @entity37 hospital , she claims she awoke determined that she would attack the disease without the help of conventional medicine			2
against the advice of doctors , ms @entity7 said she turned to alternative treatments including herbalism , craniosacral therapy and meditation			1
in addition to her vegetarian diet , she also gave up eating dairy , gluten , refined sugars , gmo foods and preservatives			0
she says that doctors advised her that she may never have children but her son , @entity90 , known as @entity91 , was born in 2010			0
a miscarriage at five months during her second pregnancy in 2012 prompted her to share her story online			0
friends say ms @entity7 , who enjoys international travel and designer clothes , may now have fled to the @entity98 amid claims she has n't been entirely honest using the @entity100 handle @ @entity101 , she quickly amassed followers from across the globe and launched her glossy cookbook and healthy eating app in 2014			1
at the time , she had , she said , been ' stable for two years now with no growth of the cancer '			0
the @entity24 app , which costs £ 2.39 , has been downloaded over 300,000 times and proved so popular that she was flown out to @entity110 last year where she was told her app was to be included on the new @entity112			1
in july 2014 , the blogger then broke the news via @entity115 , on which she has 200,000 followers , that the cancer had returned , saying : ' with frustration and ache in my heart / / my beautiful , gamechanging community , it hurts me to find space tonight to let you all know with love and strength that i 've been diagnosed with a third and fourth cancer			2
' around 12 weeks after the initial post she followed up her initial post , revealing she was undergoing ' @entity132 integrative oncology protocol '			0
the @entity24 brand , which has hundreds of thousands of followers across social media platforms , is run by mother - of - one ms @entity7 , who charges £ 2.29 for the app ms @entity7 's success might have continued unabated were it not for doubts raised about significant amounts of money raised through sales of the app that were destined for charity			1
the health guru has publicly claimed that 25 per cent of the business ' profits were being donated , last year claiming that £ 151,000 had been raised			2
it was revealed on monday , however , that ms @entity7 had failed to donate that sum			1
in a post to their @entity151 page , the @entity24 clarified they were a ' for - profit ' company and claimed the discrepancy in funds was due to their inexperience in the industry			2
' we have , like all start ups , struggled with managing all facets of a new business , biting off more than we could chew , juggling internal and external priorities with little staff			0
' we have since passed our overdue business records and accounts over to an external business manager and accounts team , an issue we are reassured arises often with overwhelmed new businesses			0
' they have been working over our finances for the last five months , and are still proceeding with a resolution in close sight			0
we were advised by this team to follow their process and allow them to finalise the donations once all business keepings were accounted first and brought forward , ' the post read in part			0
only £ 3,500 has actually reached charities so far , after campaigns flopped and profit margins were miscalculated			0
there were also revelations that neither the business nor ms @entity7 were lawfully registered as fundraising enterprises , a situation that could lead to huge fines and potential jail time			1
ms @entity7 also this week admitted that she may have been ' wrong ' about the extent of her terminal cancer			1
' it 's hard to admit that maybe you were wrong ... ( i felt ) confused , bordering on humiliated ' , ms @entity7 told the @entity8			1
she revealed a medical team from @entity132 had examined her using ' magnetic ' therapy and believes this investigation led to her misdiagnosis , although she declined to name the medical team			2
however , since then friends have come forward saying they had long held suspicions about holes in ms @entity7 's story for a long time , and revealed that whenever they tried to raise it with her they were shut down			1
' i was told last night that she booked a business class flight to the @entity98 and that ’s why she has n't been responding			0
she ’s been on a plane for the last 20 hours , ' a friend , who did not wish to be named , told the @entity208			0
@entity110 hit : ms @entity7 has also released a cookbook version of the creations that appear in the app following the success her online ventures missing money : there have been revelations that the @entity24 business nor ms @entity7 were lawfully registered as fundraising enterprises the same friend , a fellow social media personality with a large online following , said she first met ms @entity36 at a gala in early 2014 and the pair clicked			1
but they had held suspicions in recent months , like many in the same friendship group , that the young entrepreneur may have been dishonest with them			0
' she claims that she was having treatment ( chemotherapy ) when she was pregnant with @entity91 but no doctor would treat someone like that when they were pregnant , ' the friend said			0
as soon as articles began to surface this week casting doubt on ms @entity7 's story , it has been suggested that thousands of photos and social media posts which directly referenced her cancer have been deleted			1
friends have now said they had trouble reconciling her stories , and that ms @entity7 was cagey when they offered help or asked about her medical conditions			1
' it does n't make sense , no doctor would let you travel the world and she just goes away at the drop of a hat ' , the same friend revealed			2
' all she wears is designer clothes and travels the world which does n't make sense for someone who should be setting up life for their child before they die			0
' ' there ’s people that have invested their money and time … a lot of people i know have held fundraisers and supported her			0
' high profile on cancer : ms @entity7 has appeared across a number of networks ( pictured on @entity277 in @entity8 ) speaking about her approach to healing success : last year it was revealed the app would feature on the new @entity112 after it was downloaded 300,000 times failure : apparently only £ 3,500 of a projected £ 151,000 has reached charities so far , after campaigns flopped and profit margins were miscalculated another woman who almost entered into business with ms @entity7 said she was particularly devastated when ms @entity7 announced she was riddled with cancer mid-last year on social media , before telling her closest friends			1
' that is exactly when we had our main falling out , she said i was n't being supportive and i said she had n't told me personally , ' the entrepreneur told @entity208			0
this friend , who was very close to ms @entity7 , said the young mum was standoffish when she offered to visit medical appointments with her for support			2
' she ’d always just change the topic and would n't let you broach the topic			0
' the same friend claims ms @entity7 was dishonest about her age , and her illnesses , and even cast doubt on whether she ever had cancer at all			2
she also confirmed that it was her understanding ms @entity7 had ' fled ' to @entity98			2
these revelations come amid reports by the @entity313 that police visited ms @entity7 's home in @entity316 , @entity37 overnight			1
the woman 's partner apparently let officers into the property , and that ms @entity7 was not there at the time			1
@entity322 , the publisher of ms @entity7 's book which was launched off the back of her app 's success said they did not see it necessary to seek confirmation on the entrepreneur 's medical history or age during their dealings with her			1
' @entity322 did not seek or receive documentary evidence of @entity7 's medical condition or birth date prior to publication , ' a spokesperson told @entity208			2
' we did not feel this was necessary as the @entity24 is a collection of food recipes , which @entity322 has published in good faith			0
' we are concerned about the questions raised in recent days - we 'll discuss them with @entity7 as ultimately only she can answer the questions , ' the spokesperson added .			0

@entity8 ms @entity7 started it after she was diagnosed with brain cancer
