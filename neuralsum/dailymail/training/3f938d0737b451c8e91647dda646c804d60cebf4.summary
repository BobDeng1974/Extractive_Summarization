socks and other items of clothing shown to be anti-odour in laboratories may not be once when they are put into real use next to human skin , the @entity5 , @entity6 , study found			1
@entity15 textiles , those which kill or limit growth of microorganisms , may have almost no effect when used in the real world - meaning you might smell a whole lot more than you realise			1
stinky secret : socks and other items of clothing shown to be anti-odour in laboratories may not be once when they are put into real use next to human skin in two separate experiments , @entity28 researcher @entity27 and her team found that some antimicrobial textiles were far more effective at performing their advertised tasks in the lab than in testing on humans			1
' we are n't necessarily seeing the same results in the lab about antimicrobial activity translating into antimicrobial activity when we 're wearing them next to our bodies in real life , ' she said			0
dr @entity27 added that anything from sweat to the proteins in the human body can disrupt the antimicrobial properties of a fabric			0
' in reality , when it goes to the point that it gets put on a textile , it may not have the same level of effectiveness as the ones they studied , ' she said			0
dr @entity27 of the @entity5 in one experiment , the fabrics were designed to help lower the risk of infection , and in the second , the fabric was treated with a silver compound , which can be marketed as preventing odour in clothing			1
the first experiment analysed the effectiveness of three different textiles coated in antimicrobials triclosan , a zinc pyrithione derivative and a silver chloride - titanium dioxide compound			2
after putting the fabric on people 's arms under plastic film for 24 hours , the compound hardly eliminated any bacteria			2
the second experiment had similar results , and tested whether polyester textiles treated with bioactive concentrations of an antimicrobial silver chloride compound reduced armpit odour and bacterial populations			1
although lab testing showed antimicrobial activity , the treated fabrics did not lower odour or bacterial intensity when tested on people			1
overall , the team found that the in vivo ( tested on humans ) results were not comparable with in vitro ( tested in the lab ) results in how they prevented microorganisms from surviving in the textile			1
dr @entity27 said the findings highlight the importance of in vivo testing , which is less common than in vitro testing , in textile product development			0
but , because the textiles appear to be effective at reducing bacteria in the lab , she said they can still be advertised as being anti-odorous , even when they are not when worn			2
so , for now , dr @entity27 suggests thinking twice before trusting textile 's advertised claims			0
' it 's just a real spectrum to how effective they may truly be			0
so i 'd probably say , from a consumer 's point of view , if you 're actually buying something that says it 's antimicrobial , it may not be , ' she said			0
' i think that 's important to consider in relation to a lot of claims made about textiles , that is , to be sceptical about the claims marketers make			0

anti-odour textiles tested in labs do not actually work when used on people
@entity5 study found almost no effect in two experiments
*doctor* in charge of study advised people to think twice before buying
