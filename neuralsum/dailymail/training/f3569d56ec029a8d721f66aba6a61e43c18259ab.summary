by @entity0 published : 10:24 est , 15 december 2013 updated : 04:38 est , 16 december 2013 the families who arrived for the first day of the @entity3 festival in @entity4 were promised ‘ all the magic of the holiday season ’			1
what they got , however , were skinny @entity7 , reindeer without antlers … and an ice rink made out of plastic sheets			2
organisers received so many complaints from furious customers that they shut the event down after only a day			1
families had paid up to £ 65 in advance for various attractions at the town ’s @entity20 , including meeting @entity22 , ice skating and seeing huskies and reindeer			2
@entity22 : parents at @entity27 complained that @entity28 was too thin and had an ill - fitting beard and suit disappointment : the ice rink , which apparently did not contain real ice and was made of plastic instead tickets to @entity22 ’s @entity35 cost £ 6 , but it was closed for most of the day			1
when it did open , parents said the @entity7 were young , skinny , dressed in cheap costumes – and scared their children			1
the first visitors to the site , on saturday , were quick to complain about the experience on social media			2
one mother said she spent £ 42 on pre-booked tickets for various parts of the festival , only to find ‘ men dressed in @entity22 outfits from @entity51 ’			0
she wrote on her blog : ‘ this was definitely no wonderland			1
it felt like an opportunity to rip off parents who had hoped to have a magical day out with their children			1
‘ the @entity22 was disappointing to say the least			0
unfortunately , his beard was falling down and you could see his normal clothes underneath his costume			0
not exactly “ magical ” and our children asked where the real one was			0
’ @entity66 , from @entity67 , commented : ‘ i took my granddaughters to see @entity22 in @entity69 , something we do together every year , and i was so disappointed			0
animals : two reindeer were present at the event , but they apparently had no antlers empty : a pen apparently meant to hold ' reindeer and huskies ' at the @entity3 event skating : the organiser of the event insisted that the rink was never supposed to feature real ice ‘ my little @entity83 asked “ nanny have we been bad ? ” i said no , of course not , why ? “ well why did n’t the real @entity22 come to see us ? ” ’ another parent wrote online : ‘ my daughter trod in dog poo and was told by one of the events team it was actually reindeer poo			2
’ another visitor added : ‘ the staff had cheap , naff costumes , which did n’t fit			0
the main tent smelt vaguely of urine			0
’ one disappointed visitor called it a ‘ dump ’ , adding : ‘ the photos on the official website could n’t be any more misleading , it was just a funfair with a couple of tents			0
the “ huskies ” were two wolves in a cage so small that they could n’t turn in			0
i did n’t see one @entity28 light , let alone a tree			1
’ mp @entity113 was due to open the event officially yesterday , but instead it was shut down			1
a message on the website read : ‘ we regret that this event has been cancelled			1
full refunds will be issued for all tickets that have been pre-ordered			0
’ a spokesman from the @entity122 , which looks after @entity20 , said : ‘ we are very sorry to hear that some people have had such a disappointing experience			0
‘ @entity69 have told us that they will be contacting all the customers on their database to arrange refunds			2
’ cancelled : the @entity127 closed after just one day , and on the website all the event information was simply crossed out promise : but the event did not live up to the impression given on its website , according to parents festive ? the site of the @entity3 event pictured while the event was going on last night packing up : the scene outside the @entity3 area , which included a circus tent comparison : some have drawn parallels with @entity143 , pictured , which angered customers with its shoddy offerings such as a few dogs chained to sheds letdown : the park was nicknamed ' @entity150 ' for its poor displays and fake animals			1

*winter* wonderland in @entity4 opened to customers yesterday
parents claimed that @entity28 was too thin and event did not live up to promises
' we would have had more fun on a frozen *puddle* ' , says one customer
organisers *announced* today that the event would be cancelled after partner *charity* withdrew
