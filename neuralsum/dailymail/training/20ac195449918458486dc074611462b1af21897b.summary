and now what many have suspected all along has finally been confirmed ; most of them are faking it too			0
a @entity9 study , which used judges at the @entity12 state fair wine competition as test subjects , found that only 10 per cent of them realised when they were served the same wine again and again			1
hints of pretension : nine out of 10 wine experts failed to notice the same vintage being served over and over again @entity9 wine maker @entity21 , who has a background in statistics , asked organisers at the fair if he could run an experiment five years ago			1
the judges , who consisted of sommeliers , critics and buyers to wine consultants and winemakers , were given their usual selection of vintages to taste , but some of the wines were served three times , being poured from the same bottle each time			1
duped : an earlier @entity41 study found that wine experts would praise a wine if it came from an expensive looking bottle it revealed that even the most highly - respected wine tasters are next to useless when it comes to actually making any sort of reliable judgement about the relative merits			2
mr @entity21 , who runs the @entity51 in @entity52 , told the @entity53 : ' the results are disturbing , ' says @entity21 from the , described by its owner as a rural paradise			0
' only about 10 per cent of judges are consistent and those judges who were consistent one year were ordinary the next year			2
' chance has a great deal to do with the awards that wines win			0
' the judges were asked to rate wines on a scale running from 50 to 100			2
on avergae a judge 's score for the same bottle of wine varied by aropund eigght points over the three separate tastings			1
in one instance the same wine was first rated at 90 before dropping down to 86 and then rocketing up to an excellent 94			0
it is n't the first time the art of wine - tasting has come into question			0
a 2001 @entity41 study served the same wine to tasters from two different bottles - one labelled as an expensive ' @entity83 ' from @entity84 , the other as a cheap table wine			1
the tasters were glowing in their descriptions after tasting the wine from the expensive - looking bottle , but critical of the same wine from the cheap - looking bottle			0

judges at @entity12 's oldest wine fair used as test subjects
most failed to spot the same vintage being served over and over again
