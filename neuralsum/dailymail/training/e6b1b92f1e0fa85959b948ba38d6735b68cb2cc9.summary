letter addressed to ' @entity6 ' from @entity5
in it the author , whose real name was @entity5 , says he dislikes *people* finding out his real name
he adds that he has an ' intense hate ' of strangers recognising him
the letter , along with a photograph of young girl , are to be auctioned
the picture is eerily similar to those the author took of @entity76
she was the *inspiration* for the novel , but his close relationship with her lead to *accusations* that he may have been a paedophile
