@entity1 's transformation under @entity2 was recognised on friday when he was named @entity3 after three straight league wins in october			1
there was a double celebration for the east @entity8 club too as @entity9 , one of a number of exciting new arrivals in the summer , was named the league 's @entity12 after scoring a goal in each of the three victories			0
the award for @entity2 , 60 , represents a remarkable turnaround for the manager who was booed and jeered by many @entity1 fans last season for what they took as unimaginative boring football , and an uninspired final 13th place finish in the table			2
@entity2 told @entity35 : " the most pleasing thing of all is that we have managed to pull all the new players together and fitted them into a team that is playing very well at the moment and enjoying their football and getting some exceptionally good results			0
" @entity1 are currently fifth in the standings and beat @entity45 , @entity46 and champions @entity47 during october before coming from two goals down to force a 2 - 2 draw at @entity51 last weekend			1
@entity2 has guided his team to fifth in the @entity3 after 10 games @entity9 ( right ) scored three @entity3 goals , all with his head , during the month of october the @entity1 have improved in all areas this season with players like full - backs , @entity61 and @entity62 and midfielder @entity63 adding quality			1
the arrival of @entity25 and @entity66 on loan from @entity68 , has also boosted their potency in attack			0
the imminent return of @entity73 striker @entity72 from a long - term injury should further strengthen the side who are currently challenging for a top four finish and a @entity80 spot next season			0
the @entity82 striker scored during @entity1 's 2 - 1 win against @entity47 last month @entity84 deserves @entity73 call - @entity2			2

@entity1 boss @entity2 has steered his side to fifth in the table
@entity9 scored three @entity3 goals in october
the @entity1 won three out of three over the month
they beat @entity45 , @entity46 and champions @entity47
