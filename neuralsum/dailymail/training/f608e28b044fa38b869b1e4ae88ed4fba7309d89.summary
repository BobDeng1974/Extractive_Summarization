trend : eight in ten children are now given a middle name , compared with 37 per cent in 1911 ( file picture ) the main reason for the trend is the commemoration of a family member , and most are traditional			1

decision : the father is twice as likely to have a say with the middle name than the first name ( file picture ) ‘ as a result , middle names are less likely to follow popular culture and more likely to reflect age - old traditions or names that were popular in our parents ’ or grandparents ’ generation – hence the very traditional make - up of today ’s top middle names			2
’ while most second names are commemorative , a small number of parents do opt to be more creative , with a significant minority ( seven per cent ) purposefully selecting more ‘ colourful ’ second names or taking inspiration from television , film , music or modern culture by having their middle name taken from a celebrity , fictional character or royalty ( five per cent )			2
