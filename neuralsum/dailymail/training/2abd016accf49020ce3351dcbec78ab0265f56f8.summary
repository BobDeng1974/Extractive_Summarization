warring mobile phone firms could delay the launch of superfast @entity3 mobile phone networks in the @entity4			1
talks between firms hoping to launch networks are ' in the balance ' , according to insiders			1
@entity10 , the newly rebranded firm from @entity10 and @entity10 , plans to launch its service within weeks using a number of handsets including @entity15 's @entity14			1
ceo of @entity10 , @entity10 , said today the firms @entity17 will launch on october 30th operators are asking @entity19 to bring forward the auction spectrum they need to launch @entity3 services in the @entity4 , which was due to take place next year			1
they are also asking for the spectrum needed to be freed up quickly , which is currently scheduled for september 2013			0
these frequencies are currently in use by @entity27 , analogue television broadcast and radio waves used for the @entity30 and @entity31			0
however , other operators must wait for a government auction to buy the spectrum needed to launch such service , which offer speeds three time faster than current 3g networks			2
the move to give @entity10 an advantage has left other operators furious , and threatening legal action			1
this could see the entire process stalled , meaning no 4g network can be launched until the spectrum auction has been taken place - likely to be at least 12 months away			2
a source close to the talks said operators were keen to bring the auction forward , and clear the spectrum needed quickly			2
these frequencies are currently in use for @entity27 , analogue television broadcast and radio waves used for the @entity30 and @entity31			0
' it ’s fair to say that we ’re in discussions with the wider industry over @entity51 , but this is in an attempt to bring @entity3 to all @entity4 customers , not to delay the launch of @entity3 , ' said an @entity63			1
' as a result , we ’re talking as a group about the possibility of bringing the auction forward and asking if the frequencies used in the spectrum can be cleared quickly			0
' experts say further delays could be devastating for consumers			0
' i can understand why the other networks would complain - it 's a pretty compelling reason to jump ship if you 're on another network , ' said @entity79 , the editor of gadget magazine @entity80			2
' delaying the rollout is not going to be good for consumers in general , and it would be pretty devastating			0
' the move would also put the @entity4 behind other countries where @entity3 services have been available for several months			1
key issues are believed to include accelerating the long - awaited auction of the @entity3 spectrum , as well as streamlining the planning system for faster rollout of mobile masts			0
@entity94 mayor @entity93 backed the launch of @entity10 , the @entity4 's first super fast @entity44			1
however , it could now face legal challenges from rival operators			0
people close to the talks said they were ' hopeful ' the issues could be resolved before the end of a government - brokered month - long standstill agreement that prevents legal action as well as any 4g launch			1
any delay could also have a huge impact on government finances next year given the £ 4bn that could be raised by the auction of @entity51 , according to analysts			0
@entity10 , the @entity4 ’s largest mobile network with the @entity10 and @entity10 brands , said this month that it wanted to launch @entity3 in the @entity4 this year , but has been unable to give an exact date due to the talks			1
it says that it plans to reach 16 @entity4 cities by @entity116 and 98 per cent of population by 2014			2
the talks are also discussing the formation of a company called @entity120 that will make sure tv and other services do not interfere with @entity3 networks , as well as streamlining the process of planning permission for new masts needed			0
one person familiar with the talks told the ft there was a threat of ' years of litigation ' remaining			1
in addition to fears legal action could be launched to stop @entity10 's @entity3 service , there are also concerns that litigation could affect the @entity3 auction , which is set to take place early next year			1
@entity19 said it expects the auction process to start before the end of this year , with prospective bidders required formally to apply to take part			0
those applications will then be assessed by @entity19 before the bidding phase starts , likely to be in early 2013			0
mobile operators are expected to start rolling out @entity3 networks using the auctioned spectrum from the middle of 2013 , and to start offering 4g services to consumers later that year , @entity19 added .			2

threat of legal action could delay launch of first @entity44 , which was expected to launch within weeks
threat of ' years of litigation '
*crisis* talks set to end this week that could decide is the @entity4 falls further behind the @entity162 in the high speed mobile phone network race
