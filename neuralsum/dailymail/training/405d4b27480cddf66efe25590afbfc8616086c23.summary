executive producer @entity22 and another senior @entity6 staffer called @entity24 but refused to deny the claims on the record			1
mr @entity14 and his volunteers are caring for displaced and injured animals and taking food donations for them after fires destroyed large parts of the @entity32			1
mr @entity14 , who runs @entity33 in @entity4 with his wife @entity34 , claimed @entity7 producers asked him to have ‘ the donations on the lawn , all the rescuers there with the animals and those that lost their homes in the fires here for the cross overs ’			1
but after visiting on monday evening to ‘ sort out where to set up the satellite ’ and to ‘ ask that we stack the donations on the lawn ’ , @entity7 workers then allegedly failed to turn up at mr @entity14 ’s sanctuary on tuesday morning			1
mr @entity14 said @entity7 producers later told him that they tried to contact him during monday afternoon but he was out of phone range in the remote bushfire zone			2
he raged on @entity67 : ‘ we have been doing rescues and feeding the animals and families devastated by the @entity4 fires			1
' some of us have missed days of sleep , but as @entity7 were going to help get the word out about the good work of the rescue groups , and in the hope that we would raise money for them , we all went out of our way			0
' bushfires have already burned more than 12,000 hectares of land north - east of @entity83			0
more than 375 firefighters from @entity4 , @entity85 and @entity86 are currently working on securing the 240 - kilometre perimeter of the bushfire			2
the blaze has destroyed or badly damaged 26 homes so far			0
mr @entity14 fumed at the show on tuesday morning after he spent hours preparing for their arrival mr @entity14 and his volunteers lined - up boxes of food donations for the rescued animals he claims he organised piles of food to show @entity7 the work they are doing for the animals in one of the photos , a woman sits with a rescued joey inside the sanctuary a rescued possum peers out of an orange towel inside mr @entity14 's home mr @entity14 explained : ‘ now we have hours of work to get all the feed back under cover , and the rescuers have wasted time better spent doing what they do best ... ...			1
. not even a call saying they were not coming			0
' people devastated by the fires came all the way to be interview ... ... what a * * holes , in the world of mobile phones , they could have let us know last night , i will never watch that show ever again			0
' after mr @entity14 claimed he did n't receive a message or phone call from @entity7 and angrily shared his story on @entity67 , thousands of community members commented in outrage			1
@entity135 wrote on @entity7 's @entity67 page : ' i think you have quite a few angry @entity4 @entity138			1
i think they have enough troubles without the no show , no communications this morning			0
' @entity143 wrote : ' i think you have quite a few angry @entity4 @entity138			2
i think they have enough troubles without the no show , no communications this morning			0
' boxes of fresh vegetables that have been donated for the animals affected by the bushfires were piled up outside the sanctuary mr @entity14 also organised crates of water to be on site by 5.30am @entity155 called for @entity7 to apologise on their @entity67 page : ' shame on you @entity7 , hang your head in shame			1
' @entity155 called for @entity7 to apologise : ' shame on you @entity7 , hang your head in shame			0
not even the decency of a phone call			0
you are a disgrace and you owe @entity4 an apology			2
' @entity6 got in touch with mr @entity14 on tuesday morning and he then updated angry locals saying : ‘ @entity6 are not happy with my post , facts are simple i made the arrangements for their request to run the show from my sanctuary , i did everything they asked and many people went out of their way to support the broadcast			1
‘ ' 7 have said they could not contact me in the late arvo , which was because i was in the fire zone and had no coverage			0
fire fighter @entity185 posted this image of the fires in the @entity32 a burnt out house in @entity189 in the outer suburbs of @entity83 , as fires continue to burn through the @entity32 burnt out areas as fires continue to burn through the @entity32 , in @entity193 , near @entity83 bushfires have already burned more than 12,000 hectares of land north - east of @entity83 ‘ i spoke to them one in that time and said everything would go as planned			2
they then could not contact me for a couple of hours so decided to go elsewhere , without telling me , i was home from 9 pm and in range from around 7.30			0
‘ they never sent a message or phoned me to say they were n't coming			0
so if they had messaged me saying they were not coming i did not receive it , and if that message was sent it was before 7.30 when i was out of range , i have never let 7 down and they have never let me down in the past , so i had no reason to believe they were not coming , if they did send the message i apologise , but i would have thought a call or confirmation would have been more appropriate			0
’ @entity24 has contacted @entity7 and @entity6 for comment .			2
