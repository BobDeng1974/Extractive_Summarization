’ mrs @entity31 is often portrayed as an unwitting partner to her husband as he conducts a campaign of violence against many of his own people			1

supplies : rebels of the @entity209 , who have sought refuge in the mountains close to @entity214 village , in @entity206 province in northern @entity10 , pass food and other supplies to comrades across a river defiant : @entity10 rebels have set up check - points and road blocks in the north of the @entity206 region @entity10 authorities claim the opposition is made up of ' terrorist ' groups carrying out a foreign conspiracy			2

world powers have been unable to stop more than a year of bloodshed in @entity10 , a country that sits on the fault lines of several regional and ethnic conflicts			0
