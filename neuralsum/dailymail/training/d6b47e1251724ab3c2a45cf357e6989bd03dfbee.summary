holidaymakers are to be hit with bills for hundreds of pounds under @entity2 plans to impose @entity4 - style tests on caravans			1
up to 200,000 families could be affected by the draconian demands which it is warned could devastate the @entity10 ’s tourism economy			1
the @entity10 government is to launch an attempt to block the regulations , but it is feared it will be passed into law by @entity15 later this year			1
testing : up to 200,000 caravans face annual @entity4 - style tests to see if they are roadworthy under @entity2 plans under the new rules almost every caravan will have to undergo safety testing , similar to mots for cars			1
controversially , all other light trailers under 2000kg will remain excluded from testing and only caravans have been singled out			2
@entity28 mep @entity27 , a member of the transport committee pushing the reforms , argued that regular checks are needed on caravans which can often be left ' in a barn and used only once a year '			1
he added : ' then the chicken feathers are swept away and you do not know if the brakes are still ok , if the lighting works			0
' but the @entity38 , which has 375,000 members across the @entity10 , argues that families towing and staying in caravans , often with young children , are more likely to have it serviced regularly to ensure it is safe			1
a spokesman said : ‘ @entity38 actively supports and encourages measures designed to improve road safety , but has seen no @entity2 evidence that @entity4 - style testing on caravans will do so			1
‘ @entity51 is inherently very safe , with extremely low levels of reported accidents , and the overwhelming majority of accidents which do occur are caused by factors such as poor loading - causing instability - and driver behaviour , not by factors that would be mitigated by roadworthiness testing			2
’ end of the road ? campaigners warn the charges could force families to give up a past time which has been popular since the 1960s @entity66 warns that @entity4 - style testing for caravans could act as a ‘ significant financial barrier ’ to families being able to afford to keep a caravan and go on holiday			2
‘ this will in turn have a detrimental effect on the @entity10 's tourism economy , and economy in general , if the number of caravanners reduces as a result of the cost of caravanning increasing			2
‘ @entity38 members alone , annually spend £ 40 million with local businesses , when on their caravanning trips , ’ the spokesman added			0
an earlier @entity2 plan to impose testing on small trailers including caravans was rejected by government ministers from governments across the continent at a meeting in december last year			1
criticism : @entity94 mep @entity93 said the rules were unnecessary but the testing regulations have been resurrected , and will be debated in the @entity97 this autumn			0
transport minister @entity98 said : ‘ the government ’s intention is to continue to oppose such a measure			0
‘ we do not yet have a developed assessment of the costs and benefits of this specific measure but we estimate that it could require around 200,000 tests on caravans per year			1
’ @entity94 mep @entity93 said : ‘ it is the @entity2 again going right over the top with petty rules and regulations			2
‘ it is totally unnecessary			0
@entity115 keep their caravan in good order			0
' @entity118 as a whole are very sensible and caring people			0
they are not going to risk their holiday , still less their lives with a dodgy caravan			0
' if it is a couple of hundreds pounds , that 's the cost of several weekends away			0
' the plans passed their first stage in the @entity97 on july 2 , after @entity10 meps spoke out against the idea			2
@entity132 mep @entity131 said : ' there is no evidence to suggest that the inclusion of caravans – a £ 6billion pound industry in the @entity10 – and light commercial trailers would benefit from a road safety angle			1
' we should be encouraging our leisure and tourism industries , not penalising them			0
' the @entity144 refused to comment .			0
