by @entity1 reporter published : 12:31 est , 31 october 2013 updated : 12:31 est , 31 october 2013 @entity2 has provoked outrage and ridicule from its customers after changing the words of a traditional @entity8 carol on a festive ornament			1
the gaudy , red sweater ornament has dropped the word ' gay ' for the word ' fun ' in the lyric from the 19th - century carol @entity14			1
the original line - ' @entity17 we now our gay apparel ' - has been altered by the @entity19 based company for its new line of holiday merchandise			1
it now reads : ' @entity17 we now our fun apparel			1
' break from tradition : @entity2 released this sweater ornament as part of its holiday line , changing the words of carol @entity14 to : ' @entity17 we now our fun apparel ! ' the ornament of the holiday sweater , decorated with bells , bow and priced at $ 12.95 , is described as : ' when it comes to @entity34 sweaters , gaudy can be good ! hang up this flashy sweater to make your tree 's outfit complete			1
' with its catchy phrase , @entity17 we now our fun apparel ! everyone will be in on the joke			1
' deck the @entity43 is a traditional christmas carol with the tune dating back to 16th century @entity46 when it was called @entity14			1
the @entity48 lyrics were composed by the @entity50 musician @entity49 in the late 19th century ( although the ' fa @entity51 ' comes from the original @entity46 )			1
carols were originally intended to be dances and not songs - and initially frowned upon by the church			0
deck the @entity43 first appeared in the @entity56 in 1877 and was described as a ' welsh air '			2
it has remained popular during the holidays ever since			0
in 1999 , country music group @entity59 released a version of the song for @entity63 film @entity61			0
deck the @entity43 is also the title of a 2006 comedy starring @entity66 , @entity67 and @entity68			2
however the break with the traditional carol sparked anger among @entity2 customers who took to the company 's @entity74 page to complain			2
@entity76 posted on thursday : ' @entity2 has just made my boycott list for the idiotic change of lyrics in @entity14			2
i will never purchase anything from @entity2 again			2
' furthermore your ridiculous attempt at political correctness assumes that homosexuals dress differently			0
so you 've alienated @entity86 as well as homosexuals ...			0
' @entity89 added : ' i am disturbed to hear that you have removed the long - standing word " gay " from your ornament			2
had you not taken the politically - motivated stance , nobody would have noticed or complained			0
' now , you have brought this to the fore you are attracting attention , mostly negative			0
i have used @entity2 exclusively for cards over many years , but i am thinking now of migrating to another brand			0
' customer @entity101 blasted the company : ' we just cut up our gold crown card we have had forever			0
keep rewriting @entity34 carols and you will end up filing for bankruptcy			0
disgraceful ! ' in a statement today , the company said : ' @entity2 created this year 's @entity111 ornament in the spirit of fun			1
when the lyrics to " @entity14 " were translated from @entity116 and published in @entity48 back in the 1800s , the word " gay " meant festive or merry			1
@entity2 customers were quick to post their outrage on the company 's @entity74 page on thursday another @entity2 customer with a gold crown rewards card slammed the retailer for their decision to change a @entity127 today it has multiple meanings , which we thought could leave our intent open to misinterpretation			1
the trend of wearing festively decorated @entity34 sweaters to parties is all about fun , and this ornament is intended to play into that , so the planning team decided to say what we meant : " fun			0
" ' that 's the spirit we intended and the spirit in which we hope ornament buyers will take it			0

@entity147 from the 19th century carol has been changed to : ' @entity17 we now our fun apparel '
@entity2 said today : ' when the lyrics to deck the @entity43 were translated from @entity116 and published in @entity48 back in the 1800s , the word gay meant festive or merry ... today it has multiple meanings , which we thought could leave our intent open to misinterpretation . '
