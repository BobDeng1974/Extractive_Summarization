by @entity0 published : 10:45 est , 13 august 2012 updated : 13:20 est , 13 august 2012 barely 12 hours after the last firework popped over the @entity4 last night , the centrepiece venue of the @entity2 looked like a ghost town			1
there was n't a spectator in sight today at the @entity4 stadium in @entity10 , as athletes , visitors and @entity13 began their exodus from the capital			1
after 16 days of non-stop sporting action on the grounds in @entity10 , proceedings were officially brought to a close at last night 's closing ceremony			1
what a difference a day makes : the @entity4 was completely empty today after it opened its doors to thousands over the course of the @entity2 crawling : the @entity4 has seen hundreds of thousands of spectators on its grounds throughout the @entity2 the party 's over : the set of the closing ceremony is dismantled and taken away today what a difference a day makes : the @entity4 stadium was packed out yesterday for the closing ceremony instead it was the morning after the night before			1
workmen and @entity4 staff were on site to clear up the mess from the blockbuster closing ceremony			1
as the excellent weather finally gave way , the workers packed away the sets and props from the closing ceremony under overcast skies as the party seemed to be well and truly over			1
at its 80,000 seat capacity , the stadium looked like a shell as the dust settled after last night 's spectacular			0
the @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 and @entity54 - amongst others - wowed the packed venue until midnight last night , but there was n't a soul in sight today			0
many did not want the proceedings to draw to a close			0
in fact , athletes and celebrities took to @entity65 to voice their disdain that the @entity2 was drawing to a close			2
game over : the @entity4 flame was put out last night burning bright : the cauldron was extinguished gradually at the end of the closing ceremony , signalling the end of the @entity74 @entity76 's innovative cauldron was slowly opened up and extinguished at the end of the closing ceremony - officially signalling the end of @entity79 's third @entity2 in its history			1
sir @entity81 said : ' if they do n't put the flame out , the @entity2 wo n't be over			2
someone stop them ! ! ' @entity86 tweeted : ' i do n't want it to end * sob * * stamps foot *			0
' others were simply glad to have been part of the historic @entity74 closing gambit			2
model @entity94 tweeted : ' highlight of my career so far , feel so honoured			0
' @entity98 wrote after @entity51 performed in front of the 26 million strong television audience : ' we did it ! ! i love you girls so much ! ! ! ! ! ' , and fellow @entity51 @entity105 said : ' soooo much fun ! ' ghost town : workmen packed up the set at the @entity4 after the party ended rock on : the stadium was glowing and bouncing for the close of the @entity2 last night but the @entity2 has n't left the capital just yet			1
the @entity114 is due to start at the end of the month , with the opening ceremony taking place on august 29			2
with more than 2.1 million tickets sold out of a total of 2.5million , the current @entity118 is already beating the previous record of 1.8 million ticket sales at @entity123 in 2008			0
so @entity4 will be thriving once again for at least a week and a half until the closing ceremony on august 9			1
after that though the stadium is likely to close for a year , and could be taken over by local east @entity79 football club @entity127			0
there is also talk of the stadium being kept as an athletics venue , however it will be difficult to get even close to the 80,000 capacity until the @entity133 are hosted in @entity79 in five years time			0
tumbleweed territory : @entity135 looks deserted after the @entity2 ' end clean up : the mock @entity139 from the ceremony has been toppled as it is dismantled how it was : the mock @entity79 set has been taken apart since yesterday evening pack it up : the set was taken away from the empty stadium operation clean - up : workers had a tough job on their hands to clean up the mess from last night last night the stadium was filled to the rafters			1
athletes were paraded on the turf in front of the capacity crowd			0
then a festival , party atmosphere overtook the venue , as a number of musical acts , models like @entity158 , and even @entity159 and @entity160 were on stage to celebrate the @entity167			0
but now the stadium is empty			0
workmen were on site this afternoon to pack up the detritus and equipment from the closing ceremony			1
they will clear the area before preparing the venue for the @entity114 opening ceremony			2
the athletes have left @entity10 too			0
they were queuing in their droves at train stations and airports across the capital			2
@entity183 set up a special terminal for the stars to relax in before they got their flights to their homelands			2
meanwhile at @entity188 , the @entity190 team and the @entity192 team queued on one of the busiest days of the summer to await the @entity194 back to the continent			0
pack it up : @entity197 packed up some of the equipment after the @entity2 officially ended yesterday out with a bang ! a magnificent firework display was launched from the @entity4 site			1

workers pack up the set from the blockbuster @entity2 closing ceremony
@entity4 site looks alien without droves of spectators making their way to events
