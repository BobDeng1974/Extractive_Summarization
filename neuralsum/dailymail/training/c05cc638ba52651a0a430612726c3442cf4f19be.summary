by @entity1 reporter published : 15:36 est , 22 january 2014 updated : 17:41 est , 22 january 2014 @entity3 has purposefully kept his private life out of the public eye for decades but now he has broken that trend by revealing all in a new documentary about his artist father			1
the new @entity10 documentary that premiered at @entity11 reveals that the reason why the legendary actor ’s father left his mother when the boy was only 3 - years - old was because he realized that he was gay			1
@entity3 , who was named after his father @entity17 , narrates much of the film and reads directly from his father ’s personal journals wherein he grapples with his sexuality in a less accepting time			2
son and father : @entity3 has produced a documentary about his father @entity17 ( right , seen together before his 1993 death ) out in the open : @entity3 , seen with producing partner @entity28 ( left ) at @entity11 on sunday , said that he first wanted to do the film just for his family but then decided his father 's artistic career was worth sharing the two - time @entity34 winner said his father , who died in 1993 from prostate cancer , may never have resolved the issues that he had with @entity38 as he came to grips with the realization that he was gay			1
@entity17 reportedly had an amicable split from his wife , and remained a constant presence in his son ’s life as they all continued living in @entity47			0
' i did this for him , ' @entity3 told the audience at the premiere in @entity52 on sunday			2
' i wanted my younger kids - who were born after he died - to know what their grandfather did			0
i even kept his painting studio intact so they could see it			0
' artists : while his father ( seen left , in an undated photo ) , who realized later in life that he was homosexual , was a painter , @entity62 ( right ) chose acting as his form of expression @entity65 : the elder mr @entity3 was a figurist painter , as his son is seen standing next to one the many works of art on display in international museums @entity3 has six children , four of whom were born after their grandfather died in 1993 - including one who was born in 2011 via surrogate			1
the actor 's two children from his first marriage to @entity78 - his eldest son , @entity79 , and her daughter from a previous relationship that @entity3 adopted - both met their grandfather			1
@entity17 became known in some @entity47 circles in the 1950s and 1960s for his influential work in the abstract expressionist movement			0
he went on to hold chaired professorships and has works displayed as part of the permanent collections at renowned museums like the @entity90 , the @entity91 and the @entity92 , but he never quite achieved the same level of celebrity as some of his contemporaries like @entity97 and @entity98			1
though the documentary clearly comes two decades after his death , his son was eventually convinced that it is more than just a family story			2
family affair : @entity3 , seen here at the @entity105 ceremony in 2009 , said that he wanted to make the film for his children who did not get a chance to meet his father ( seen with three of his six children and his wife @entity112 ) ' originally , @entity3 wanted to make the film just for his family			2
but then we realized it tells the story not just of @entity119 's work - which is amazing - but the entire art world of the time , ' director @entity114 told @entity122			0
while @entity62 's works emerged during post @entity125 , when abstract expressionism became popular , his style was not described in the same way			0
it was often considered figurist , depicting still life ' in simple set - ups with no pretension , ' as described in the half - hour documentary			0
paternal bond : @entity135 , who has called @entity3 one of his most meaningful mentors , made a low - key entrance as he slipped in to watch the premiere of the documentary at @entity11 ( seen together at the @entity141 ) he became increasingly disconnected from the abstract expressionist movement , inspired more by early 20th century @entity144 artists like @entity145			1
' he was very clear about what he thought was art and what he liked , and yet at the same time he was generous			0
people can appreciate things , it does n't matter if the aesthetic can be different from yours , ' @entity3 told @entity154 at the film 's premiere			0
' he did n't feel that certain things art-wise were art. it was another thing that was n't enough for him , and his own style as you see was always the same			0
it varied some but not a lot			0
’ though the father - son duo were close , there was a shift as @entity3 's acting career took off since hist his father felt somewhat resentful that his own work had never been recognized by a bigger audience			1
for @entity3 , the documentary , scheduled to air on @entity10 this summer , serves as an homage to his father , whose paintings are still shown in galleries around the world , and also as a memory for his own children			2
' i realized how important it is for children to appreciate certain things ( their parents ) want to share with them , ' an emotional @entity3 says in the film			2
@entity3 founded the @entity185 in his hometown of @entity47 but he wanted to bring the documentary to @entity11 to make sure the spotlight was fully on the works and memory of his father			1
' we were really thrilled that it was chosen for @entity11 because it separates from having it at @entity185 and we see @entity3 's father 's works on its own in a different setting than you would in @entity47 , ' producer @entity28 said .			1

@entity3 produced and narrated a new documentary about his artist father who left his mother when he was only 3 - years - old
he only discovered later that the marriage *crumbled* because his father realized that he was homosexual
@entity62 and his father , @entity206 , remained close until his death in 1993
now he has released a documentary about his father and it premiered at the @entity11
his father was a well - known artist but never achieved the same success as his contemporaries like @entity98 or @entity97
