@entity0 believes @entity2 style investment is needed to turn @entity4 clubs back into a @entity6 force but admits that scrapping the salary cap would be dangerous			1
with the @entity10 league becoming a honeypot for billionaire financiers – comic book tycoon @entity8 has used his chequebook to turn @entity14 into double @entity6 champions – the gulf between clubs from the @entity18 and the @entity19 is bigger than ever			1
saracens are the only @entity4 team featuring in this weekend ’s @entity23 semi-finals and , with the west @entity25 side being major underdogs against @entity26 , @entity20 legend @entity0 believes the domestic game needs to readdress the balance			1
@entity0 believes huge investment is needed to turn @entity4 clubs back into a @entity6 force @entity31 says it 's a money issue for @entity4 sides and they need @entity2 style investment ‘ when you walk about @entity10 dominance , the teams are coming from @entity10 but the players are n’t , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ it ’s a money issue – players are not just moving to @entity10 for a tan			1
the @entity4 utopia is that each club gets a @entity2 , who makes it their little pet			1
‘ then they are able to extend salary caps and attract better players			2
that married with the best of the @entity4 academy players coming through – of course they ’d then be competitive again			1
but certain @entity4 clubs are being squeezed and the cap is there to save them			1
not many clubs are profitable and you have to be careful because the long - term picture could be trouble			2
’ while @entity14 have flexed their financial muscles by recruiting international stars such as @entity61 , @entity62 and @entity63 , @entity4 clubs have found themselves priced out of the market for southern hemisphere superstars			2

@entity26 , who face @entity21 in @entity73 on saturday , have an impressive raft of imports including @entity76 , @entity77 and @entity78			0
the @entity80 outfit , according to @entity0 , are the best club to never have been crowned @entity6 champions and should be the favourites for the title			0
@entity84 's @entity68 has already signed with @entity85 for after this year 's @entity67 @entity21 ( pictured training this week ) are the only @entity4 team left in the @entity23 among those expats is full - back @entity89 , who shone in the quarter - final victory over @entity92			1
@entity0 believes that , along with @entity14 flanker @entity93 , the @entity4 should feature in this year ’s @entity67 - calling for the @entity94 to activate the ‘ exceptional circumstance ’ clause geared towards overseas players			2
‘ from a player point of view : yes they should both be be picked , ’ said @entity98			0
‘ they are the players playing the best at the moment and you pick on form			0
but when you set out your stall early and you then have to backtrack a bit , i do n’t know if you lose a bit of face			0
you create your own stick to be beaten with			0
‘ it ’s better to have guys coming in during the autumn than guys coming in now for the august matches : hurry , hurry , get to know one another , get some chemistry			0
what is the balance you go for ? personally , i think you play the best players			0
