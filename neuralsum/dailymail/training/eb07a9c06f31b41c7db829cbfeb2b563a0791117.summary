as she natters over tea and cakes with other ladies in the village , @entity0 looks just like any other pensioner			1
but incredibly @entity0 , 74 , used to be a man called @entity6			1
and five years ago , at the age of 69 , he became the oldest person in the @entity10 to undergo a full sex change operation			1
reborn : @entity0 , 74 , is now delighted that she is a woman after spending 69 years of her life as @entity6 , right ' most people have no idea i used to be a he , ' reveals @entity0 , in her first ever interview , ' and some people might wonder why at such a late age i bothered to go through such a major operation			1
' but i ’m proof it ’s never too late to change your sex			1
being a woman is fantastic			1
just knowing i will die as a proper woman has come as a huge relief			1
' now @entity0 , who as a woman is still a virgin , has one more goal – she would love to meet a toyboy : ' although i ’m in my seventies most people comment i do n’t look a day over 50			1
' i ’d love to have a male companion to grow old with , a man ideally younger than me , to share the rest of my life with			1
' @entity0 ’s long and torturous journey to become female began early in childhood when as @entity38 she loved nothing more than to dress up in her mum ’s high - heeled shoes			1
' i loved to try her make up too , ' recalls @entity0 , the middle of three children , ' but it caused endless upset in the family			1
' my parents were horrified			1
both of them would tell me off and although i regularly told them i wanted to be a little girl , they would just reply , " do n’t be so stupid			2
" ' by the time @entity0 reached her teens she ’d experienced terrible bullying at school			1
' my nickname was querie , ' she says , ' girls and boys were both wary of me and i had few friends			2
also at risk : @entity60 is one of several hospitals still at risk from the shaping a healthier future series of reforms which are currently out to consultation ' a few girls did fancy me but i did n’t fancy women at all			2
and then although i did fancy some men , i used to fantasise about being their girlfriend , not wanting them as another man			2
' meanwhile , dad , a man ’s man , who was a bricklayer before he became a prison officer , tried to toughen me up by taking me onto building sites with him			0
i hated it so much i used to cry myself to sleep			0
' consequently , at the age of 17 , and having saved up some money by working in the kitchens of a local hotel , @entity0 left the @entity84 village where they lived and moved to @entity86			1
but the prejudices just continued			0
' i was so unhappy at home , i ’d longed to get away , ' she recalls , ' but the first few nights i ended up sleeping rough on the streets			0
thankfully i then found the @entity91			0
' @entity0 found another job working in kitchens			1
but even there she did n’t fit in			0
' people did n’t warm to me , ' she says , ' the problem was my feminine side just came through all the time			0
by now i felt sure i was a woman trapped in a man ’s body			1
' yet it was the 50s and it was shocking for a man to be feminine like me and absolutely unacceptable			0
once i went out and literally got a good kicking just because a bloke took said i looked like a poof			0
' however , she was so worried that in her early twenties she saw her gp			0
' i told him i thought i ’d been born into the wrong body , ' she said			0
he referred her to @entity60 ’s gender clinic where she was seen by dr @entity113 , a pioneering doctor in transgenderism			0
happy at last : @entity0 is now living in the @entity116 coastal town of @entity117 she says : ' for the first time someone understood what i was going through			1
until then i ’d felt a freak so it was a relief to know there were others like me			0
' after undergoing a barrage of medical and psychological tests , @entity0 was put on hormones			1
' the idea was that the hormones would make me feel more feminine and because of that i would feel more comfortable within my body , ' she says			1
within weeks breasts had started to grow , her beard was less noticeable and her penis had started to shrink			0
' but while i felt better about myself and happier inside , attitudes were n’t like they are today			0
these days i ’ve read about people having a sex change and then turning up to work dressed as the opposite sex			1
' had i turned up to work dressed as a woman it would have been a national scandal			1
i ’d have been instantly sacked			0
' and so a new life developed			1
' i would dress as a man to go to work , ' she says , ' and then when i got home put on my wig , a dress and make up			1
' amazingly she even entered a beauty pageant for women			0
' i always wore a lovely long blonde wig			0
i was so convincing i actually came third			0
even then that no - one guessed anything was unusual about me – and in fact doing that beauty pageant gave me a boost – because i knew for sure then i ’d been born in the wrong body			2
' but most of the time life was fraught with difficulty			2
' i lived in fear of meeting someone from work and them recognizing me			0
or , just as bad someone realizing i was n’t actually a woman and marching me off to the police			2
then everything had to be done under cover			0
' for the next twenty years @entity0 continued living as a man by day and a woman by night			1
by her early thirties she had also fallen in love with a man in his twenties and they began living together			0
' we lived together as husband and wife but to the outside world he was my lodger , ' she says , ' it was sad that we had to pretend to others we were n’t a couple but society was not accepting as it is now			0
' just coming out as gay was almost unheard of let alone as a man living as a woman			2
in those days that was how it had to be			0
' however , when @entity0 reached her late 40s he broke her heart			1
' he left me for another woman , ' she says , ' it was terrible as i could n’t even confide in anyone about why i was so devastated			1
' by now @entity0 had read about someone having a sex change and when she asked her doctors they agreed she could have one – but there was a long waiting list and she would have to live and work as a woman day and night for several years before she ’d qualify			1
@entity0 says : ' it was probably the hardest time because as a woman it was impossible to get a job			1
i could n’t lie – work places always needed to see things like birth certificates and yet i could n’t afford not to work either			0
' also as a man working i earned more than if i ’d worked as a woman			2
' although she managed initially to gain a job as a woman working in a factory , when that job ended she found herself working on the roads and then at @entity221 in @entity222			2
' working as a man meant i got so much more money , ' she says , ' i had bills to pay so i ended up back in the old cycle of dressing as a man in the day and a woman at night			1
' by now the hormones had made my breasts grow to a @entity231 – it was agony as i had to flatten them with tight vests			0
' however , finally when @entity0 retired she was able to live properly as a woman and fulfil the criteria			1
' after i retired at 65 i could live full time as a woman and finally at the age of 69 i got to the top of the @entity242 waiting list			2
' i could n't believe it - but for me it was better late than never			2
' and in june 2006 at @entity60 hospital she finally underwent the five - hour surgery she ’d longed for			2
the penis and testicles were removed and a vagina was formed			0
' i remember the nurse waking up me up			0
she said , " you ’re a @entity255 now ” and immediately i put my hand between my legs			0
the thrill that i was so neat and flat was fantastic			0
' it really felt as if i were being reborn , the start of a new life			1
' she moved to the seaside and today lives in a two - bed flat in @entity117 , @entity116 , bought with redundancy pay from her job at @entity221			2
she says : ' a handful of people who ’ve known me a long time do obviously know i used to be a man , but most people have absolutely no idea			0
' the only thing i think people find unusual is i still have quite a husky voice when i speak			0
it ’s strange because my body is so feminine – other women often comment for example on my legs , which are one of my best features			0
' but being a proper woman has changed my life			1
i feel so much more confident – i have lots of friends who i have cups of tea with and chat with and i ’m a great carer			0
' i 've always been a motherly sort of person and now i look after a 96 - year - old lady who lives nearby			2
' now there is only one thing left to do			2
' the doctors tell me everything is in working order but i ’ve yet to find my mr @entity295 , ' she says , ' and meeting someone special would make my life perfect			1

parents used to be horrified by their young son dressing up in high - heeled shoes and make - up
sex change operation left @entity6 feeling reborn as @entity0
proud woman wants to meet mr @entity295 to make her life ' perfect '
