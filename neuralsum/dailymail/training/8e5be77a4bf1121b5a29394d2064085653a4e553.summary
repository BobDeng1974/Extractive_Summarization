the number of nurses from the @entity2 allowed to work in @entity3 has doubled in just four years , raising fears of patients being put at risk due to language issues			1
there are now 20,914 registered to practise in hospitals and care homes , compared with 10,244 in 2010			1
but @entity2 laws mean the nursing watchdog is banned from testing their command of the @entity15 language or their medical competence before giving them a licence to work because it is deemed to threaten ‘ freedom of movement ’			1
@entity22 ' groups are warning that an influx of nurses from @entity25 is threatening patient safety because @entity2 rules do not allow hospitals to test their grasp of @entity15 before hiring them leading doctors have warned that the poor communication skills of some @entity2 nurses is putting patients in danger , and say their skills are not up to the same standard of @entity3 - trained colleagues			1
separately , the @entity38 , the regulator of standards , last night announced it was relaxing the rules on nurses from outside the @entity2 coming to work in @entity3			1
at present @entity43 nurses must prove their @entity15 is of a high enough standard before going on a course of up to 12 months at university which includes supervised work on a ward or in a care home			1
the @entity38 is replacing the course with a single test – half of which includes an online , multiple - choice quiz – to enable hospitals to recruit more quickly			2
the watchdog insisted the test would be rigorous , but patient groups warned that it was a major step backwards that would put patients at risk			0
over the past year many hospitals have been desperately recruiting nurses from abroad to fill understaffed wards			2
this was partly fuelled by a report into the @entity69 hospital scandal , in which hundreds of patients died due to poor care , that warned many hospitals had too few nurses			1
latest figures from the @entity38 show that in 2013 - 14 , some 5,388 nurses from the @entity2 joined its register , up from 3,436 the previous year – and the 2,715 who joined in 2011			1
as it is unable to carry out its own tests on @entity2 nurses , the @entity38 has urged hospitals , care homes and gp surgeries to carry out checks on individuals before employing them			1
a survey in june of more than 100 senior @entity89 managers found that 52 per cent did not normally use aptitude tests when recruiting nurses from the continent			2
the poll also revealed that 54 per cent of @entity95 bosses planned to recruit nurses from overseas , mainly @entity97 , @entity98 , @entity99 and @entity100			0
@entity89 trusts have been desperately recruiting nurses from overseas in the wake of the @entity69 scandal , when hospitals were criticised for not having enough nurses @entity107 , from @entity108 , said the increase in @entity2 nurses was ‘ really alarming ’			1
he added : ‘ it seems we just are n’t training enough of our own nurses			0
we ought not to have this reliance on workers coming here from overseas			0
‘ again and again we have seen concerns about the communication skills of these workers , and communication is absolutely critical when it comes to healthcare			0
’ on the relaxing of rules for nurses from @entity43 nations , he said : ‘ this is ludicrous			2
they are just doing whatever is expedient to fill posts			0
‘ however good a nurse is , if they have trained abroad they may well not be familiar with the systems here and the drugs we use			0
this is a major step backwards for patient safety			0
it ’s as if the @entity139 scandal passed the @entity38 by			1
’ @entity140 , an executive director at the @entity141 , said : ‘ too often , nurses are recruited from overseas to fill short - term gaps and given inadequate support to care for patients well			2
’ one senior @entity89 official , who works in the @entity147 , said there were concerns that the lack of checks would ‘ put patients at risk ’			0
speaking on condition of anonymity , he told the @entity156 newspaper : ‘ without a period of supervision , there is absolutely no way you can tell whether they are actually capable of delivering safe care			0
’ @entity164 , chief executive of the @entity38 , insisted the new test for @entity43 nurses was ‘ internationally recognised ’ and ‘ rigorous ’			0
it would ensure that they were ‘ able to practise safely and effectively in the @entity3 ’ , she added .			0

there are 20,914 nurses from @entity2 working in hospitals and care homes here
rules state testing @entity15 skills would *contravene* ' free movement ' laws
hospitals have been taking on nursing staff in wake of @entity139 scandal
