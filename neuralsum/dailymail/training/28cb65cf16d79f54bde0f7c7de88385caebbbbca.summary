located 100 metres beneath the surface of a @entity3 mountain , this nuclear bunker is a relic of the cold war			1
in the 1960s chairman @entity6 ordered regional governments across @entity3 to build nuclear bunkers in case of a surprise attack from the @entity11			1
many of the bunkers such as this one in @entity14 in the eastern @entity3 @entity15 , abandoned for many years , are now being reborn as potential tourist attractions			1
the construction project continued from the 1960s and into the 1970s as @entity3 leadership were fearful over the intentions of their northern @entity36 neighbour			0
some other bunkers are used in the summer to allow people spend time underground where the air temperature is considerably cooler allowing them to escape from the sweltering conditions			0
however , @entity3 is not the only country where they are trying to develop new uses for abandoned nuclear bunkers			2
one bunker built near @entity47 in @entity48 , which was built for £ 30 million was on sale earlier this year for just £ 200,000			0
the bunker is located at a former army camp in @entity52 , where @entity53 was held for one night after he flew to the @entity54 to negotiate with @entity54 authorities			0
this area appears to be a very basic latrine with a two troughs offering only the most rudimentary toilet facilities the bunker in @entity14 consists of just six rooms and an area set aside to act as an armoury as well as a control room the abandoned structure has begun to look quite dilapidated as it has not been maintained in recent years at the very centre of the bunker , more than 100 metres below ground , designers built a high security armoury to hold weapons during the summer months , some locals are known to use the bunker in order to escape sweltering temperatures the bunker is accessed through the side of a mountain in a manner more commonly associated with the lair of a @entity82 villain			2

the nuclear bunker in @entity14 , eastern @entity3 , was built in the 1960s in *response* to a possible @entity11 *missile* strike
chairman @entity6 ordered the construction of bunkers at the height of the cold war because of a possible threat
many of these bunkers are no lying abandoned although some are being *redesigned* as potential tourist attractions
