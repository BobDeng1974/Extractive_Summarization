private eyes : @entity1 is on the list drawn up by @entity3 @entity1 is on an explosive list of blue - chip firms and individuals who used rogue private detectives , it emerged last night			1
the music mogul is among the 102 names on the list drawn up by the @entity3 ( @entity3 ) that the @entity12 is threatening to publish on monday			1
the list is dominated by big law and finance firms and high street solicitors , but also contains two individuals – one of whom is multi-millionaire @entity1			2
@entity3 has stressed that the presence of a name on the list does not amount to evidence of wrongdoing			2
officials say many clients of rogue investigators did not commission information - gathering activities or will not have been aware that the private eyes broke the law to obtain information			0
following a threat last week by @entity33 , chairman of the @entity12 , to publish the list , senior mps lined up with @entity36 figures yesterday to demand that it remain secret			1
in what appeared to be a co-ordinated campaign , other commons committee chairmen backed @entity42 ’s most senior anti-terror officer , the information commissioner and cabinet minister @entity43 to insist the plan to publish the list be shelved			1
it has raised the stakes even higher in a long - running row over whether the list drawn up by the @entity3 ( @entity3 ) should be made public			2
mr @entity33 has given @entity3 an ultimatum to publish the dossier by monday – or see mps do it themselves			1
he said it gave an appearance of ‘ injustice ’ for law firms , insurers and other big businesses on the list to remain secret while journalists have been relentlessly pursued for links to phone hacking and other illegal practices			2
but yesterday , @entity3 director general @entity65 rejected this request and , in a strongly worded letter , called on mr @entity33 to think again			2
the committee was bombarded with letters from senior figures saying it would do great harm to publish the list of 102 law firms , insurers , financial companies , banks and individuals who were clients of corrupt investigators			1
they included warnings from mr @entity43 , who is @entity82 , the information commissioner sir @entity83 , and sir @entity84 and @entity85 , the chairmen of @entity88 ’s @entity87 , respectively			1
secrecy : @entity91 chairman @entity33 , left , and cabinet minister @entity43 , right mr @entity65 also said that he had the support of @entity94 assistant commissioner @entity93 , who is in charge of terrorism			1
the onslaught alarmed mps , with one senior committee source commenting : ‘ this is very suspicious			0
it seems there is some sort of co-ordinated operation going on to prevent us from publishing what could be very embarrassing information			0
’ mps were given two reasons for secrecy			0
mr @entity65 and the information commissioner claimed publication might compromise inquiries into whether those on the list could be prosecuted			1
sir @entity83 said : ‘ it ’s not clever to start a criminal investigation by publishing the names of everyone and everything you ’re investigating			0
mr @entity43 and the two committee chairmen took a different line , pointing out that when mr @entity33 received the list from @entity3 in july he gave an undertaking it would be kept confidential			1
mr @entity43 said that , if mr @entity33 broke his word , future inquiries by @entity107 could be refused access to confidential documents			0
mr @entity33 now faces tense talks with fellow committee members			0
they have so far insisted it is vital the public know the truth about relations between big firms and corrupt detectives			0
mr @entity33 told mr @entity65 last week : ‘ we ’ve taken legal advice and we believe it ’s important that this should be done			0
’ @entity145 member @entity144 said : ‘ there do n’t seem to me to be any issues of national security or other issues pertaining to the wider national interest			0

serious @entity3 says 102 firms and individuals who hired ' hackers '
@entity157 says it will publish list on monday
