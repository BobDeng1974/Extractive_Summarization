yesterday the nation celebrated the second lunar month , when it is good luck to get a haircut			1
also known as ' the day the dragon raises its head ' , it is widely believed you should have your own one refashioned in tribute			2
fresh start : this little boy seems not to care that his haircut is a good luck token to mark the second lunar month tradition : your maternal uncle will die if you cut your hair in february , they say , so the trim is celebratory the day is referred to as @entity23 , which means ' the dragon raises its head ' so a haircut honours that move but the tradition does not seem to have gone down well with this group of children			1
whereas adults and barbers took to the streets with scissors and smiles , their sons and daughters can be seen screaming and crying as they go under the razor			0
some entire families get a number one , much to the infants ' distaste			0
others , however , use the day as a chance for a restyled trim , demonstrated by one little tear - soaked boy getting a fresh bowl cut			2
despite the traditions and folklore , these children in @entity49 's @entity48 can not help but tear up they join thousands of @entity53 people who take to the streets for a trim before parades and markets it is a large - scale operation , but the tradition is based on a misunderstanding of a fairytale , experts claim according to folklore academics , the legend was about a man ' thinking of his uncle ' who he used to give a haircut to in february			1
but in @entity53 , that sounds very similar to the phrase ' dead uncle ' the distraught toddlers seem unconcerned with the notion that this is a luxury - for if you shave in february , your maternal uncle will die			1
according to folklore experts , the superstition stems from a misunderstanding			0
in a well - known @entity53 legend , a poor barber could not afford a decent new year 's gift for his uncle , so he gave him a haircut			2
many children have an entire shave to celebrate , whereas some have some more outlandish styles unusually , this little boy grinned amongst his screaming peers as he was given a whole new look as he seems well aware , the haircut will be followed by dancing , singing and @entity53 pancakes as the fresh rainy season comes for farmers ' crops , this is seen as a fresh start for people this little boy looks frightened and unsure as he leans away from the razor - armed hairdresser his uncle said it was the best gift he had ever had and wanted to make it a yearly tradition			1
after his uncle died , the barber cried every new year thinking of him			2
but ' thinking of his uncle ' was mistaken for ' death of his uncle ' because in @entity53 their pronunciations are almost the same			0
reaching the end , this little boy shows off his new fringe as the barber combs the back to finish parents are well aware what a hassle this day can be , so are on - hand to make it easier for the hairdresser only one of the group in @entity49 's @entity48 , in @entity118 province , seemed content as he grinned and stuck his tongue out			0
but their tears will have doubtless been dried later with a trip to one of the thousands of parades			0
families also celebrate the day with pancakes and dumplings .			0

@entity3 celebrated @entity132 , the start of the second lunar month , on march 2
good luck to cut hair for *vigorous* start to the spring season
first cut for weeks as it is believed your uncle will die if you trim in february
