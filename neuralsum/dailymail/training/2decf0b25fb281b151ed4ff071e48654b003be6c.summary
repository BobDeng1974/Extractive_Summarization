the official said @entity13 has been cooperative and it appears he has not made any admissions that could be used against him			1
the tenuous legal line is that the reintegration team is focusing on the five years he spent in captivity , not how he got there			0
and @entity2 officials said there is no suggestion that @entity13 was guilty of any misconduct while he was held captive , so there is no reason yet to read him his legal rights			1
the officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the case publicly by name			0
