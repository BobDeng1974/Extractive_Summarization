unwell : @entity3 's @entity0 has had to travel to @entity7 for medical treatment in august , @entity0 travelled to @entity24 for a routine check - up and was declared in good health - much to his delight			1
immediately after returning to @entity3 , the @entity0 , who has no children and thus no heirs , issued a statement that read : ' @entity32 of @entity33 is honoured to reassure the loyal citizens of @entity3 that his majesty @entity0 is in sound health after conducting medical tests , which his majesty will continue over the coming period in accordance with a specific medical programme			2

built in the 1650s , the @entity63 is the work of @entity67 and is @entity3 's most visited national monument			0
after two days in @entity3 , the royal will travel on to @entity70 , the capital of the @entity71 , to take part in the @entity73 at @entity74 and @entity75			0
the event , which will help raise funds for @entity2 's @entity80 - based @entity79 charity @entity81 , will also include a charity dinner , during which he will make a speech			0
@entity2 hopes that the extra funds will allow the charity to scale up the @entity87 , which addresses the emotional and psychological needs of children living with @entity90			0
