the earthquake disaster in @entity1 has highlighted how @entity3 's land masses are already in the process of forming a new supercontinent			1
that 's according to one researcher who travelled to the country to study how the @entity10 and @entity11 plates are moving together			1
and using new techniques , researchers can now start examining the changes due to take place over the next tens of millions of years like never before			2
@entity3 's continents are slowly moving together ( left ) , and in 50 to 200 million years they are expected to form a new supercontinent called @entity18 ( right )			1
in 2012 a study suggested this may be centered on the @entity21			0
recent evidence is revealing how this will compare to the ancient supercontinents @entity25 and @entity26 the idea that @entity3 is set to form a new supercontinent - dubbed @entity18 - is not new			1
but , as reported by @entity31 from the @entity32 , @entity30 geologist dr @entity29 travelled to @entity1 to study the collision of the @entity10 and @entity11 plates			1
the idea that @entity3 is set to form a new supercontinent - dubbed @entity18 - is not new			1
but new techniques are allowing experts to study the changes in unprececdented ways			0
where exactly this supercontinent will form , however , has been the cause of some debate			2
while some had suspected it would be centered around @entity47 , a study by @entity45 in 2012 suggested that the @entity21 would actually be the centre point			0
@entity49 will crunch together , with the @entity51 and @entity52 disappearing , while @entity53 will join the @entity49 , according to the study			0
they said the changes would occur in 50 to 200 million years			1
despite already being attached to @entity11 , the @entity10 plate is continuing to move @entity49 at a few centimetres per year - causing tectonic activity			1
but other continents are also moving towards each other			2
the @entity61 is narrowing at a few centimetres per year , which will ultimately cause @entity63 to collide with @entity11 , while @entity64 is also moving towards @entity53 by 2.8 inches ( 7cm ) a year and will join @entity18			1
‘ it would take at least tens of millions more years - perhaps several hundred million years - before the new supercontinent is fully formed , ’ dr @entity29 told the @entity32			1
using new techniques - namely high - resolution seismic tomography , geographical information systems and increased computing power - scientists are able to track these changes in unprecedented ways			0
for example , they can compare them to previous supercontinents @entity25 and @entity26 , which formed one billion and 300 million years ago respectively			1
‘ these advances have allowed us to link present - day plate tectonics on @entity3 's surface to dynamic processes deep in the mantle - and to link these to ancient records of geology , ’ dr @entity29 said			0
many of @entity3 's land masses are continuing to move into each other			0
the @entity61 is narrowing at a few centimetres per year , which will ultimately cause @entity63 to collide with @entity11 , while @entity64 is also moving towards @entity53 by 2.8 inches ( 7cm ) a year and will join @entity18 this map shows how @entity1 is situated near the border of @entity10 and @entity53 , where two tectonic plates are moving into one another			1
the @entity10 plate is continuing to move @entity49 at a few centimetres per year - causing tectonic activity , which in turn can lead to tremors and devastating earthquakes the @entity101 says 8 million people have been affected by the weekend earthquake in @entity1 that killed nearly 4,400 people and 1.4 million people are in need of food assistance			1
@entity108 , @entity101 resident coordinator in @entity109 , told reporters that of those affected two million people are in the 11 worst - hit districts			0
the challenge of supplying to small villages at high altitudes and in rough terrain " is quite significant , he said			0
after flying by helicopter over @entity119 town , on the north side of the @entity121 , he estimated about 40 % of the houses were damaged , but destruction was erratic			0
where exactly this supercontinent will form , however , has been the cause of some debate			2
while some had suspected it would be centered around @entity47 , a study by @entity45 in 2012 suggested that the @entity21 would actually be the centre point			0
@entity49 will crunch together , with the @entity51 and @entity52 disappearing , while @entity53 will join the @entity49 , according to the study			0
they said the changes would occur in 50 to 200 million years			1
the most recent supercontinent , @entity26 ( which is @entity134 for ‘ @entity135 ’ ) , formed about 300 million years ago with @entity47 at its centre			1
it began breaking apart into the seven continents of today with the birth of the @entity140 about 100 million years later			1
researchers said the earthquake in @entity1 highlighted how dangerous shifting tectonic plates can be			2
pictured , @entity1 people walk among the debris of houses after the quake in @entity148			2
the death toll in @entity1 following the 7.8 - magnitude earthquake is continuing to rise and could hit 10,000 this series of graphics shows how our land masses have separated from @entity26 into the distinct continents we have today			2
using new techniques - namely high - resolution seismic tomography , geographical information systems and increased computing power - scientists are tracking the changes in better detail researchers believe @entity26 is the third or fourth supercontinent in @entity3 ’s history			2
its immediate predecessors were @entity25 - which formed around 1 billion years ago - and @entity169 , which formed 1.8 billion years ago			0
the idea of continental drift was introduced by @entity174 scientist @entity173 in 1912 to explain how the shape of @entity3 ’s countries looked suspiciously like jigsaw pieces that would fit together			0
the @entity3 ’s surface is formed from seven major and several minor tectonic plates that wander around at speeds varying from a few millimetres to two centimetres a year , the same pace that a human nail grows			0
it ’s the friction caused by plates grinding against each other that causes earthquakes .			0

@entity31 from the @entity32 reported on @entity18
within 200 million years , he said the new supercontinent will form
one researcher recently travelled to @entity1 to gather further information
he *spotted* that @entity10 , @entity11 and other plates are slowly moving together
