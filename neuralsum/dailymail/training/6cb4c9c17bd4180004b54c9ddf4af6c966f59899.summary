by @entity0 published : 11:57 est , 30 november 2013 updated : 12:06 est , 30 november 2013 topless barber : 46 - year - old @entity4 , @entity2 resident @entity1 was arrested wednesday night on suspicion of cutting hair without a license and felony criminal impersonation			1
witnesses told police she gives topless haircuts a 46 - year - old grandmother in @entity4 , @entity2 was arrested earlier this week after allegedly offering topless hair cuts			1
since authorities could n't find evidence of the @entity16 ads offering nude barbering services , @entity1 was arrested for practicing without a license and felony criminal impersonation			1
but friends of @entity1 say she was wrongly accused as part of a ploy by her ex-husband and ex-business partner who wanted her behind bars			1
authorities started investigating @entity1 when a series of checks bounced for chair rentals at a salon on the 2200 block of @entity33 in @entity34 , according to the @entity35			0
it turned out the checks had n't been signed by @entity1 , so it was difficult to peg her for check fraud , but she was n't off the hook			0
police soon found out that @entity1 was practicing as a hair stylist in @entity34 without a license , after being previously ordered to stop working in 2008 for the same reason			1
in addition to illegal hairstyling in @entity34 , @entity1 opened a hair salon called @entity48 in nearby @entity49 with a business partner			1
but @entity1 soon left the salon when her co-owner , a woman named @entity53 , objected to certain business practices			2
witnesses told police that @entity1 started ' charging $ 45 for topless haircuts and is advertising on @entity16 '			1
police were unable to find the @entity16 advertisements , but it is possible that they were flagged and purged			2
the accusation is interesting considering a picture @entity1 posted to her @entity63 in august			0
salon uniform : @entity1 posted a picture on @entity63 which made it seem as if she were wearing nothing			0
in the caption she wrote that she ' decided to wear nothing but flowers to work today ' in the picture , @entity1 appears to be wearing nothing , and covers herself up with bouquet of flowers			0
' soooo frckn hot today ... decided to wear nothing but flowers to work today ... @entity75 never wear thorny roses , ' she wrote			0
once @entity53 found out about the topless haircuts , their business relationship deteriorated			2
police say @entity53 was ' not comfortable with this and she did not want to have topless haircuts in her business because she is a single mother and ... she did not believe this was safe and proper '			1
but topless haircuts may have just been the tip of the iceberg			2
@entity53 believes @entity1 went so far as to solicit sex from male customers after noticing a strange man come into the salon , and finding used condoms in the trash later			0
prostitution allegations : @entity1 co-owned and operated a salon in @entity49 before being pushed out by her business partner who believes she was soliciting money for sex from their male customers @entity53 told police that @entity1 admitted to accepting payment for sex , sometimes going on ' house calls '			1
divorce : @entity1 's ex-husband told police that she started advertising her services on @entity16 after leaving the salon			1
their break - up must have been recent , as she posted this picture of ' my husband ! ' to @entity63 in early october eventually , @entity1 agreed to leave the business and started working freelance as a stylist in @entity4			2
her ex-husband told police that she advertised her services on @entity16 as the ' @entity120 ' claiming that her license ' was in the mail ' and that she had also a applied for ' a nude license of hairstylists '			1
no such license exists , police confirmed with state regulators			0
@entity1 's break - up with her husband seems to be relatively new			2
on october 4 , she posted a picture of him on her @entity63 calling her husband ' one hot @entity133 '			0
friends say @entity1 was the target of a ' witch hunt ' orchestrated by her ex-husband and business partner who ' got together and lied to police and tried to get her arrested '			1
a man named @entity141 claiming to be @entity1 's friend wrote on her @entity63 , saying that her business is legal as you do n't need to have a hair styling license to own and operate a salon			1
' to her friends and family ... i 'm going to clear her name and all this slander , ' @entity141 wrote			0
' to @entity152 and @entity53 as well as all the haters out there ... f * * * you ... stay turned folks i 'm gon na bust this s * * * wide open ... do n't f * * * with an @entity160 soldier			0
' witch hunt : a man named @entity141 claiming to be @entity1 's friend posted on her @entity63 , saying she was innocent and he would prove it @entity1 has a pretty lengthy record with nine previous felony convictions including identity theft , motor vehicle theft , felony theft and possession of a weapon by a previous offender			1
she also has a misdemeanor record			0
according to her @entity63 profile , @entity1 is a grandmother , keeps cats and an albino snake as pets , likes country music and bought herself a motorcycle for her birthday			0
as of friday , @entity1 was being held at the @entity178 on $ 25,000 bond			0
