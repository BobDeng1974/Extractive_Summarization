by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 07:10 est , 29 august 2013 updated : 11:41 est , 29 august 2013 the @entity5 could launch a military strike against @entity7 without the support of the @entity9 , government legal advice released today claims			1
@entity10 published the official legal position suggesting @entity5 would not breach international law if it launched ‘ military intervention to strike specific targets with the aim of deterring and disrupting ’ further use of chemical weapons			1
and the government released an intelligence report – likened to the so - called @entity21 dodgy dossier – which claimed it is ‘ highly likely ’ that the @entity7 regime was responsible for a chemical attack in @entity24 on august 21			1
but @entity34 leader @entity33 has refused to back the government , setting seven different conditions which would need to be met before the opposition would support an air strike			1
mps have been recalled to @entity40 to debate the @entity5 response to the use of chemical weapons against the @entity7 people			1
mr @entity33 wants the government to pursue any action through the @entity9 , but both @entity47 and @entity48 have vowed to veto any @entity9 resolution backing military action			1
ahead of this afternoon ’s debate , @entity51 released its legal position insisting @entity5 could legally go it alone and support the @entity54 in a targeted strike to act as a deterrent for future use of chemical weapons			1
justifiable : the two - page legal position insists @entity5 could carry out a targeted military strike against @entity7 without securing a @entity9 resolution the legal advice states : ‘ previous attempts by the @entity5 and its international partners to secure a resolution of this conflict , end its associated humanitarian suffering and prevent the use of chemical weapons through meaningful action by the @entity70 have been blocked over the last two years			1
' it argues that if @entity47 and @entity48 continue to block action through the @entity70 there would be ' no practicable alternative ' to the use of force to ' deter and degrade the capacity for the further use of chemical weapons by the @entity7 regime '			1
it adds : ‘ in these circumstances , and as an exceptional measure on grounds of overwhelming humanitarian necessity , military intervention to strike specific targets with the aim of deterring and disrupting further such attacks would be necessary and proportionate and therefore legally justifiable			1
‘ such an intervention would be directed exclusively to averting a humanitarian catastrophe , and the minimum judged necessary for that purpose			0
’ as the main party leaders briefed their mps on their return to @entity98 for the emergency recall of @entity40 , six @entity94 jets were deployed to @entity100 to protect @entity5 interests and sovereign bases			1
the prime minister yesterday battled desperately to get a consensus for a missile attack , but was forced by mr @entity33 and @entity107 rebels to allow @entity9 inspectors time to report on last week ’s chemical weapons atrocity			2
top brass : chief of the defence staff , general sir @entity112 ( @entity113 ) and defence secretary @entity114 arrive for a cabinet meeting at @entity51 @entity116 : international development secretary @entity117 , communities secretary @entity118 and home secretary @entity119 were briefed on the latest developments in @entity51 today but a three page dossier from the @entity122 made clear that the @entity124 regime was responsible for the chemical weapons attack last week in which 350 died			1
the @entity122 found there are ' no plausible alternative scenarios to @entity124 's regime being behind the attack and has given the prime minister full access to ' highly sensitive ' intelligence			1
it could not , however , come up with a ' precise motivation ' for the attack			2
it concludes : ‘ it is not possible for the opposition to have carried out a chemical weapons attack on this scale			2
‘ the regime has used chemical weapons on a smaller scale on at least 14 occasions in the past			2
‘ there is some intelligence to suggest regime culpability in this attack			1
these factors make it highly likely that the @entity7 regime was responsible			2
’ cabinet ministers were briefed on the latest intelligence this morning , ahead of the @entity154 debate			0
a @entity10 spokesman said : ‘ the judgment of the @entity122 is that a chemical weapons attack did occur in @entity24 last week ; that it is highly likely that the @entity7 regime was responsible ; that there is some intelligence to suggest regime culpability ; and that no opposition group has the capability to conduct a chemical weapons attack on this scale			1
‘ ministers agreed that it is fundamentally in our national interest to uphold the longstanding convention on chemical weapons and to make clear that they can not be used with impunity			0
‘ any response should be legal , proportionate and specifically in response to this attack and everyone around the @entity116 table agreed that it is not about taking sides in the @entity7 conflict nor about trying to determine the outcome			1
’ here is the full text of the @entity122 assessment of the @entity7 chemical weapons attack , followed by a letter from @entity186 , chairman of the @entity122 , to the prime minister : @entity122 assessment of 27 august on @entity189 use in @entity24 a chemical attack occurred in @entity24 on the morning of 21 august , resulting in at least 350 fatalities			1
it is not possible for the opposition to have carried out a @entity196 [ chemical weapons ] attack on this scale			2
the regime has used @entity196 on a smaller scale on at least 14 occasions in the past			2
there is some intelligence to suggest regime culpability in this attack			1
these factors make it highly likely that the @entity7 regime was responsible			2
extensive video footage attributed to the attack in eastern @entity24 ( which we assess would be very difficult to falsify ) is consistent with the use of a nerve agent , such as sarin , and is not consistent with the use of blister or riot control agents			1
there is no obvious political or military trigger for regime use of @entity196 on an apparently larger scale now , particularly given the current presence in @entity7 of the @entity9 investigation team			1
permission to authorise @entity196 has probably been delegated by president @entity226 to senior regime commanders , such as [ * ] , but any deliberate change in the scale and nature of use would require his authorisation			2
there is no credible evidence that any opposition group has used @entity196			0
a number continue to seek a @entity196 capability , but none currently has the capability to conduct a @entity196 attack on this scale			2
@entity47 claims to have a ' good degree of confidence ' that the attack was an ' opposition provocation ' but has announced that they support an investigation into the incident			1
we expect them to maintain this line			0
the @entity7 regime has now announced that it will allow access to the sites by @entity9 inspectors			2
there is no immediate time limit over which environmental or physiological samples would have degraded beyond usefulness			0
however , the longer it takes inspectors to gain access to the affected sites , the more difficult it will be to establish the chain of evidence beyond a reasonable doubt			0
from @entity186 , chairman of the @entity122 to the prime minister : @entity7 : @entity267 following the widespread open source reports of chemical weapons ( @entity196 ) use in the suburbs of @entity24 in the early hours of 21 august 2013 , the @entity122 met on 25 august to agree an assessment			1
at a subsequent meeting on 27 august we met again to review our level of confidence in the assessment relating to the regime 's responsibility for the attack			1
the @entity122 's conclusions were agreed by all @entity122 members			0
the final paper informed the @entity285 meeting on 28 august , at which i provided further background and a summary of the most recent reporting , analysis and challenge			0
the paper 's key judgements , based on the information and intelligence available to us as of 25 august , are attached			0
it is important to put these @entity122 judgements in context			0
we have assessed previously that the @entity7 regime used lethal @entity196 on 14 occasions from 2012			0
this judgement was made with the highest possible level of certainty following an exhaustive review by the @entity308 of intelligence reports plus diplomatic and open sources			0
we think that there have been other attacks although we do not have the same degree of confidence in the evidence			0
a clear pattern of regime use has therefore been established			0
unlike previous attacks , the degree of open source reporting of @entity196 use on 21 august has been considerable			0
as a result , there is little serious dispute that chemical attacks causing mass casualties on a larger scale than hitherto ( including , we judge , at least 350 fatalities ) took place			0
it is being claimed , including by the regime , that the attacks were either faked or undertaken by the @entity334			0
we have tested this assertion using a wide range of intelligence and open sources , and invited @entity340 and outside experts to help us establish whether such a thing is possible			0
there is no credible intelligence or other evidence to substantiate the claims or the possession of @entity196 by the opposition			0
the @entity122 has therefore concluded that there are no plausible alternative scenarios to regime responsibility			0
we also have a limited but growing body of intelligence which supports the judgement that the regime was responsible for the attacks and that they were conducted to help clear the @entity334 from strategic parts of @entity24			1
some of this intelligence is highly sensitive but you have had access to it all			0
against that background , the @entity122 concluded that it is highly likely that the regime was responsible for the @entity196 attacks on 21 august			0
the @entity122 had high confidence in all of its assessments except in relation to the regime 's precise motivation for carrying out an attack of this scale at this time - though intelligence may increase our confidence in the future			2
there has been the closest possible cooperation with the @entity377 in producing the @entity122 's assessment			0
we have also worked in concert with the @entity54 intelligence community and agree with the conclusions they have reached			0
