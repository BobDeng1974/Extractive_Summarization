he said : ' before my transplant , i could not eat or drink and needed to be fed intravenously for 14 hours a day			1
' although i could have tastes of food and drink , i did not benefit nutritionally from them at all			0
' now i have a completely normal diet			0
after 18 months of not being allowed to eat , i confess i ate a lot of chocolate , sweets and cakes			0
now , i 'm cutting down those treats and achieving a more balanced diet			0
' i 'm also working on building up my energy			0
i used to do a lot of fitness activities and go to the gym and i 'm working my way up to being able to do more			0

what happened to me was so out of the blue because i was very fit			0

ms @entity16 was also losing up to four litres of liquid a day through her abdominal wall , which was scarred and damaged following years of surgery			1
after being put on the transplant waiting list , ms @entity16 had a bowel and abdominal wall transplant at the @entity25 in january this year			1

since june 2012 , a total of 10 patients have undergone abdominal wall transplant surgery at the @entity25			2
every year , around 25 to 30 people require small bowel transplant operations			2
half of these patients may also need an abdominal wall transplant because their own abdominal wall muscle has suffered due to injury or multiple operations			2
consultant surgeon @entity127 , who is a member of the @entity128 ( @entity129 ) , led the team who carried out the operations			0
he said : ' an intestinal transplant is both life - saving and life - creating			2
it helps to solve extremely difficult living conditions for patients , many of whom have spent years unable to eat solid food leaving them completely reliant on intravenous feeding for up to 18 hours a day			2
' for these people , being able to eat and taste again is a revelation , so this is truly transformative surgery			0
' whilst our progress over the past year is hugely exciting , we want to raise awareness that this type of surgery is now possible , as we are reliant on the generosity of donors for transplant procedures to go ahead			2
' the success of these first operations has been made possible through close collaboration between all transplant surgeons , anaesthetic staff , donor co-ordinators , as well as the @entity159			2

@entity4 , 42 , the first person in the @entity5 to receive the transplant
and @entity16 , 28 , was the first woman to undergo the procedure
