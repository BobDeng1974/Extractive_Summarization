the head of the @entity1 has launched a blistering attack on politicians for penny pinching and ' making it up as they go along '			1
air chief marshal sir @entity5 said military figures wanted ' answers now ' but had to deal with civilian leaders who left everything till the last moment and were obsessed with cost			1
the comments , which are likely to spark anger in @entity14 , came in a speech to a conference organised by the military think - tank the @entity18			2
air chief marshal sir @entity5 said politicians lacked decisiveness and accused them of ' making it up as they go along ' sir @entity5 , @entity24 , told the event in @entity26 that the @entity1 's core function was to look after the airspace of @entity30 territory - but accused politicians of always wanting to do more with less cash			1
' that balance between what the politicians might want me to do and how much they want me to pay for it , and how much time and effort and resource they wish me to invest in it			2
' that has always been the way , that balance between politics and the military			2
' sir @entity5 went on : ' i am a military man , i want an answer now			1
the politician - " if i could leave it a couple of days , could you wait till the end of next week , i really do n't feel like making a decision just yet			0
i 'll leave it right till the last moment , do i have to make a decision now ? " ' i want that decision now ... i want to know exactly what you want me to do and i want the end state ... defence secretary @entity60 is unlikely to react kindly to sir @entity5 's remarks ' the politician , he 's not really sure what the end state is , he does n't really care , he 's got to be seen to be doing something , " we need to be there , i 'll make that up as we go along			1
" that does n't sit comfortably			0
' he said the military were only concerned with whether they had ' enough people and enough equipment to get the job done '			2
but he said , for the government ' the big cruncher ' was always ' how much is all this going to cost ? ' he added : ' i do n't care about the cost			0
i need the resource , the people to get the job done , get the end state in the timeline			0
' we are trying to balance that political ambition with my military ambition , my need to explain to the politicians , if you give me @entity90 , i can do @entity91 ' senior military figures have repeatedly raised concerns about the impact of the coalition 's spending curbs , which have seen force levels cut and equipment programmes trimmed			1
an @entity1 spokesman said : ' the comments made by the @entity24 must not be taken out of context			0
his commentary was based on previous academic discussions at the conference and related to the differences between any international military leader , who has to make decisions based on tactical circumstances and political decision makers who have to take into account a far broader and more complex picture			0
' it was certainly not intended as any form of critique of the current @entity116 or any previous @entity116			0
