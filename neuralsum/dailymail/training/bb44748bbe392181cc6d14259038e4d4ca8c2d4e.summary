by @entity0 @entity1 have welcomed back star midfielder @entity2 to their pre-season training camp in @entity4 following a summer of speculation and accusations			1
the @entity8 international has been a crucial force in @entity1 's recent success as the club has won the @entity12 twice and @entity13 once since his arrival in 2010 but was heavily linked with @entity15 and @entity16 in the off season			1
last week @entity2 reassured the anxious @entity1 faithful , vowing to remain at the @entity19 despite months of seemingly trying to drive a wedge between himself and @entity12 champions			2
he 's back ! @entity2 has finally joined up with the @entity1 squad after months of speculation ‘ i want to stay , ’ said the @entity8 midfielder			1
‘ i will always honour my contract			0
i do n’t think about all this speculation			0
' it ’s a big pleasure to stay and enjoy the next season			0
the fans have always been good to me			0
’ his agent @entity31 , who had spent the whole summer manufacturing alleged conflicts with @entity1 , added : ‘ everybody can stop speculating about this			0
' however this was not the case at the end of last season			0
@entity2 was apparently ' very upset ' for @entity1 not presenting him with a birthday cake			2
champions : @entity2 was instrumental as @entity1 regained the @entity12 title last season then it was also alleged that on a trip to @entity47 to celebrate winning the @entity12 , the club ’s owners did not shake @entity2 ’s hand			2
@entity31 then asserted that it was ‘ 50 - 50 ’ whether the midfielder would remain at @entity1 next season , even though his contract runs until 2017			1
@entity2 , meanwhile , praised the squad and ambition of @entity16 whilst also admitting a yearning to finish his playing days back at his former club @entity15			1
powerhouse : @entity2 revealed he will stay at @entity1 after a summer of speculation following @entity8 ’s exit from the @entity60 suggested @entity1 did not allow him compassionate leave to spend time with his terminally ill brother @entity63 , who died last month			1
however this has been denied by the club , stating they understand that @entity2 has been through a traumatic period following the death of his brother and they insist there have been no rows between the player and the club			0
luckily for @entity1 fans it appears all is calm between @entity2 and @entity1 with the @entity12 champions kicking off their title defence with a trip to @entity79 on august 16 .			2
