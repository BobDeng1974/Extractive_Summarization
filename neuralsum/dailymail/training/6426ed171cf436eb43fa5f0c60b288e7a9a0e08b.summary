by @entity0 published : 14:20 est , 30 january 2013 updated : 06:05 est , 31 january 2013 a steam train enthusiast was crushed to death when a train took off in the wrong direction while he was standing behind it , trapping him between two carriages			1
retired police officer @entity9 , 65 , died almost instantly from ' extreme ' chest and abdominal injuries , an inquest heard today			1
he had been helping a fellow volunteer uncouple carriages at @entity15 station , when he signalled for the driver to take off			2
mr @entity9 , was working as a guard on the @entity25 , when the incident took place on may 21 last year			1
it is thought mr @entity9 , from @entity29 , @entity30 , returned to the area between the carriages before he was struck			1
@entity33 , who was driving the @entity35 steam locomotive , said it was possible he did not lock a reversing lever into place , which could have allowed the locomotive to slip between forward and reverse			2
enthusiast : a steam train pictured on the @entity25 , where ' enthusiast ' on which mr @entity9 worked as a guard the retired professional train driver with more than 50 years ’ experience , said : ' i turned round to see which way was i was going and the next thing i knew i was going the opposite way			1
' i slapped the emergency brake on			0
i was more concerned we were going to collide with the coaches we ’d just come off			0
i never even thought about mr @entity9 going back between the coaches			1
he added : ' there was no impact at all			0
at that point the fireman said to me , ‘ is the guard on your side ? ’			0
i said no. ' mr @entity33 said he got off the footplate , adding : ' i found mr @entity9 trapped			1
all i can remember is seeing his legs dangling down from between the coaches			0
that ’s all i could see			0
' he said there was no way of freeing mr @entity9 so he contacted the signalman and told him to call the emergency services			1
' the next thing i knew , the operations manager mr @entity70 came out ' ” he said			0
' i think he shouted , ‘ @entity72 ’ , a few times but there was no response			0
' mr @entity33 said they moved the train to release mr @entity9 before paramedics and police arrived			1
pathologist @entity79 said mr @entity9 died of chest and abdomen injuries			1
he added : ' the injuries indicated an extreme crushing force			2
the internal injuries were very severe			2
i think death must have occurred very quickly due to the severity of the injuries			2
' accident investigators said the incident was ' highly unusual ' and experts had re-enacted some of the events to figure out what happened			0
both mr @entity9 and mr @entity33 were both very experienced railwaymen in whom the investigators had complete confidence , @entity98 , of the @entity99 , told jurors			2
he said mr @entity9 would have had ' no reason to believe ' the train would change direction , which was most likely caused by the driver forgetting to lock the reverse lever			1
' if it was the case that he did n’t apply the latch , it is probably a case of simple forgetfulness that all human beings are capable of , ' mr @entity98 added			0
the inquest will resume tomorrow , when the jury will be sent out to consider its verdict			0
sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			0
