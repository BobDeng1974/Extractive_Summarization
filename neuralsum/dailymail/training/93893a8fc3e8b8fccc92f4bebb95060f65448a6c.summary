by @entity0 published : 15:03 est , 13 february 2013 updated : 18:46 est , 13 february 2013 a senior @entity2 mp was accused of sexism yesterday after remarking on @entity5 ’s ‘ thin ’ appearance – and suggesting her stressful job may have caused weight loss			1
@entity8 , chairman of the @entity10 home affairs committee , was condemned by female @entity11 over his comments on @entity13 about the home secretary ’s figure			1
‘ a bit worried about home secretary , she is looking a bit thin these days			1
a new diet or pressure of work ? ’ he wrote			0
@entity8 described home secretary @entity5 , pictured here in 2010 ( left ) and 2012 ( right ) , as ' a bit thin ' his remarks caused a backlash from mrs may ’s colleagues , one of whom said mr @entity8 should ‘ concentrate on his own waistline ’			1
another , equalities minister @entity32 insisted : ‘ she looks fantastic , she is fantastic			0
would the same be said of a male mp ? ’ conservative mp for @entity34 , @entity35 , chairman of the all - party group on body image , said mr @entity8 ’s remarks were ‘ particularly thoughtless ’			1
‘ i think they came across as rather patronising , ’ she said			0
‘ i ’m reasonably confident as a woman in politics who has had to bear the brunt of comments about my own weight that this is something that dished out to women @entity11 and simply is n’t to the same extent to men			0
‘ i ’m very conscious that i have an interesting relationship with food - my weight goes up and down , and people will frequently comment that either i ’m looking a bit chubby or have lost a bit of weight			0
@entity8 took to @entity13 to make the ' thoughtless ' comments about mrs may ‘ i think it ’s sexist			1
the remark that @entity8 very unfortunately put on @entity13 was that this was about a woman who was losing weight because of the pressure of work			1
it is no secret that @entity5 has taken up a regime of healthy eating , has been walking a lot and has lost weight			0
’ conservative mp @entity71 said : ‘ @entity13 is a medium that people say silly things on			2
i ’m sure he would apologise if he thought about it			0
’ @entity8 has been criticised by may 's colleagues over his remarks about the home secretary 's appearance mrs may , 56 , is thought to have lost a stone and a half over the last year , having gone on a diet and been working out regularly in the gym			1
she also enjoys energetic holidays in @entity85 , where she goes mountain walking			0
the home secretary is fiercely protective of her private life , rarely giving personal interviews , and her admirers have been irritated by the focus on her celebrated kitten - heeled shoes			1
there has been increasing speculation that she could succeed @entity97 as @entity99 leader , having impressed with her steely grip on the @entity101 , which was a political graveyard for a series of @entity2 ministers			2
earlier this week , @entity105 , one of the leaders of a @entity108 revolt over the @entity110 budget , said she had ‘ good claim now to be the most reforming home secretary in respect of the police since sir @entity116 ’			1
mrs may would never stand against mr @entity97 , but is thought likely to throw her hat into the ring in any future contest - particularly if @entity120 enters the fray			2
a vicar ’s daughter , the cabinet minister is a strong @entity125 and said in a recent interview : ‘ i think it ’s important to do a good job and not to feel that you ’ve got to make grand gestures , but just to get on and deliver			0
’ mrs may has encouraged growing comparisons between her and @entity133 ’s most powerful leader , @entity134 chancellor @entity132			2
‘ there are still people who do n’t rate her , are a bit dismissive , perhaps because of the way she looks and dresses , and she goes walking in the @entity142 and all that sort of stuff , ’ she said			0
‘ what matters is , what has she actually done ? and , when you look at her abilities in terms of negotiation , and steering @entity134 through a difficult time , then hats off to her			0
’ a spokesman for mrs may said she did not wish to respond to mr @entity8 ’s remarks .			2
