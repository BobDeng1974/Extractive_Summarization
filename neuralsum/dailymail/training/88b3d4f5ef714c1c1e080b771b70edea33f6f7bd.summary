you might have seen some amazing images of @entity2 from space , but you probably have n’t seen anything like this			2
using images from a @entity8 weather satellite , an incredible time - lapse of @entity2 in @entity10 has been created , showing our planet in stunning hd			1
in the video both hemispheres , and then @entity2 as a whole , are shown with the sun ‘ moving ’ across the surface as the planet rotates			2
in it @entity2 is seen rotating with the sun sweeping across the surface			1
he used images from a @entity8 weather satellite the video was created by @entity21 from the @entity22 in @entity23			1
he used images captured by the geostationary @entity35 weather satellite from 15 to 19 may 2011			2
the images were resized by 50 per cent , misalignments between frames were manually corrected , and image artifacts that occurred when the camera was facing towards the sun were partially corrected			0
the images were interpolated by a factor of 20 to create a smooth animation			0
the animation was rendered in the @entity47 @entity46 resolution of 3,840 x 2,160			0
the @entity8 satellite orbits at a height of 25,000 miles ( 40,000km ) above the ocean and at such a speed that it always remains over the same spot on the planet			1
every 30 minutes the @entity8 satellite takes a 121 megapixel image ( 11,136 x 11,136 pixels ) of @entity2			1
normally it shows vegetation as orange , rather than green , as the camera on the satellite uses both visible and infrared light			0
but mr @entity21 edited the images to make the vegetation appear more natural			2
in the video the glint of the sun can be seen on the @entity66 as @entity2 rotates			2
the first part of the video shows sunlight washing over the @entity71 , before then taking a look at the @entity73			0
the final part shows the entire @entity2 being lit up by the sun in images from @entity35 - @entity77 to see the @entity2 in @entity46 at every angle click here video from @entity21 - @entity21 the video uses images captured by the geostationary @entity35 weather satellite ( illustrated ) from 15 to 19 may 2011			1
this @entity8 satellite orbits at a height of 25,000 miles ( 40,000km ) above the ocean and at such a speed that it always remains over the same spot on the planet on his @entity47 channel mr @entity21 explains why features like the city lights and other stars are n’t visible			1
‘ city lights are not visible because they are thousands of times less bright than the reflection of sunlight off the @entity2 , ’ he said			0
‘ if the camera was sensitive enough to detect city lights , the @entity2 would be overexposed			0
’ the sun is purposefully not visible directly to protect the cameras on the satellite from direct exposure to sunlight , while stars are obscured from view by a mask - although they would not be bright enough to be visible anyway			0
every 30 minutes the @entity8 satellite takes a 121 megapixel image ( 11136 x 11136 pixels ) of @entity2			1
normally it shows vegetation as orange ( previous picture from the satellite shown ) , rather than green , as the camera on the satellite uses both visible and infrared light , but the latest video was edited to make it seem more natural			0

@entity117 from the @entity22 in @entity23 created a high - definition video of planet earth
images from a @entity8 weather satellite are ' *joined* ' to make video of @entity2 rotating with the sun sweeping across
@entity21 used images from the @entity35 satellite that sits above the @entity66 at a height of 25,000 miles
every 30 minutes the satellites takes a 121 megapixel image of @entity2
