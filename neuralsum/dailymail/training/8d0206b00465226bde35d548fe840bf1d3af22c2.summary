by @entity0 published : 23:10 est , 3 january 2014 updated : 10:45 est , 4 january 2014 @entity2 awoke on friday for the first time in half a century with the right to buy new and used vehicles from the state without special permission , but markups of 400 percent or more quickly dashed most people 's expectations			1
at the state - run @entity13 dealership in @entity15 on friday morning , where prices ranged from $ 91,000 for a 2013 model 206 to $ 262,000 for a 508 , people walked away shaking their heads in disgust			1
' i earn 600 @entity2 pesos per month ( approximately $ 30 )			1
that means in my whole life i ca n't buy one of these			0
i am going to die before i can buy a new car , ' @entity25 , a state driver , said , walking back to his 1950s @entity26			0
a @entity42 diplomat quipped , ' i am slightly flabbergasted			0
with these prices , the old - time @entity45 cars will not disappear fast from the streets			0
' under a reform two years ago , @entity2 can now buy and sell used cars from each other , but until friday had to request authorization from the government to purchase a new vehicle or second - hand one , usually a rental car , from state retailers			1
before september 2011 , only automobiles that were in @entity2 before the 1959 revolution could be freely bought and sold , which is why there are so many 1950s or older cars , most of them @entity45 - made , rumbling through @entity2 streets			2
along with @entity2 's famous rolling museum of vintage @entity45 cars , there are also many @entity68 - made cars , dating from the era when the @entity68 was the island 's biggest ally and benefactor			2

a car drives past under a banner that reads , ' @entity79 will continue forward ' , in @entity15 this car once was for sale for $ 5,000 dollars , but the price has risen to as much as $ 30,000 , after a new law has greatly restricted vehicle ownership in the country newer models are largely in government hands and were sold used before friday at a relatively low price to select individuals , for example , @entity2 diplomats , doctors and teachers who served abroad			1
across town from the @entity13 dealership , where more than a hundred used rent - a - cars went on sale for prices ranging as a rule from $ 25,000 on up , disgust turned to anger on friday			2
' these prices show a lack of respect for all @entity2			0
what is here are wrecks			0
i now have no hope of getting a car for my family , ' artist @entity109 said , looking at a 2005 @entity114 on sale for the equivalent of $ 25,000 and available outside the country on the internet for $ 3,000			0
a teacher looked at the price list and yelled ' are there any bicycles ? ' as she stomped away without giving her name			0
the @entity2 state maintains a monopoly on the retail sale of cars			1
there are 650,000 autos on the island , half of them owned by the government			1
a vintage automobile drives by a parking lot of modern vehicles in @entity15 , @entity2 price list of new and used foreign - made cars for sale at a car dealer in @entity15 the decades - old ban on importing cars and need for state permission to purchase from the state has left nine out of 10 @entity2 households without a car or other vehicle such as a motorcycle and dependent on the decrepit public transportation system			1
the cost of new and used cars sold by @entity2 to each other is similar to those that went on sale on friday because of limited availability			2
the government said all profits would go into a special fund to upgrade public transportation			1
diplomats , foreign businesses and select @entity2 will still need government permission to import a new or used car without the huge markup			1
the liberalizing of car sales was one of more than 300 reforms put forth by president @entity32 , who took over for his ailing brother @entity171 in 2008 , and approved in 2011 at a congress of the @entity173 , @entity2 's only legal political party			0
the proposed changes put a greater emphasis on private initiative , which had been largely stifled under @entity2 's @entity68 - style system , and less government control over the sale and purchase of personal property such as homes and cars			1
people talk as they stand in a street blocked by a broken down classic car in @entity15 , @entity2 a @entity2 photographs the price list of new and used foreign - made cars for sale at a car dealer in @entity15 ' these prices will clearly be outside the purchasing capability of the vast majority of @entity2 , even with the support from relatives abroad			1
in essence , they represent a luxury tax imposed by the government on the nouveau riches of @entity2 , ' @entity198 , one of @entity200 's leading academic experts on @entity201 and author of a number of books on @entity2 , said by email			0
there are now tens of thousands of small private businesses in @entity2 , and thousands of farm , construction , transportation and other types of cooperatives , all of which in theory should benefit from the opening up of car sales			2
@entity222 , a @entity2 expert at the @entity223 in @entity224 said in an email that many businesses needed vehicles , but such high prices would make it difficult for most and cut into other business activity , stalling their overall development			0

friday was the first day since 1959 that @entity2 were allowed to buy new and used cars from the state without permission
@entity2 were *sad* to discover that cars were going on sale from $ 91,000 to $ 262,000 at a 400 per cent price mark - up
the @entity2 state maintains a monopoly on the retail sale of cars . there are 650,000 autos on the island , half of them owned by the government
@entity2 earn on average only $ 20 - $ 30 per month and not many @entity2 already own cars
diplomats , foreign businesses and select @entity2 will still need government permission to import a new or used car without the huge markup
the money earned by selling the cars is meant to go to a fund to upgrade public transportation
