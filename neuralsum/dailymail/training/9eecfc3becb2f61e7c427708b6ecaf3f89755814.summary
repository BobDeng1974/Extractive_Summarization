rapist footballer @entity0 has been rejected by @entity1 , the @entity2 side facing a relegation dog fight			1
@entity1 chairman @entity4 claims to have turned down an approach from associates of the 25 - year - old about the possibility of the convicted rapist playing for the club , which is currently second from bottom in the league and six points adrift of safety			1
the former @entity17 international was jailed for five years after a jury unanimously agreed he raped a drunk woman in a @entity21 hotel while his friends filmed it in 2011			1
@entity0 was released after serving half his sentence but is struggling to find a new club because of the furore over his crime and his lack of contrition			1
@entity4 and his wife @entity30 , who have became the owners of @entity2 's @entity1			0
mr @entity4 says he was contacted by representatives of rapist @entity0 about playing for the club @entity4 said he had twice been contacted by people on behalf of @entity0 about possible talks but refused to pursue the idea			1
@entity0 continues to protest his innocence and has lodged an appeal with the @entity39			2
he was initially given permission by former club @entity41 to return to train with the club at the request of players ’ union , the @entity45			1
following his release last month , pressure mounted on @entity41 not to resign the player or welcome him back to its grounds			1
new life : the former professional 's fiancee @entity52 has said ' all he wanted to do ' was return to his career and @entity55 says he had ' served his time ' so should be able to start again outrage : @entity57 ( left ) vowed to have her name removed from one of @entity41 's stands and @entity61 ( right ) resigned her patronage over the issue a string of its patrons tendered their resignations over the issue , with olympian @entity57 vowing to have her name removed from one of the stands at @entity71 should he be reinstated			2
following the backlash - 160,000 people signed a petition against it - the club retracted its offer last week			0
@entity4 , former chief executive of the @entity79 , and wife @entity30 took control at @entity1 in august			0
he said in a statement released to the @entity82 : ‘ @entity1 has not been approached by @entity0 or his management team to discuss him joining the club			1
career : the striker , pictured on monday , who used to play for @entity41 , had his invitation to train at the club revoked ‘ however , on two occasions persons with a connection with @entity0 offered to facilitate a discussion if i wished to pursue that			1
‘ i strongly believe in the general principle that people have a right to rehabilitation after serving a sentence for a crime			0
‘ however , i also take the view that whether any particular club would wish to employ someone who has been convicted of a very serious crime is a subjective decision for the club to take after considering all the circumstances , and that there is no simple right or wrong answer			0
‘ @entity30 and i are trying to re-establish the brand of @entity1 as a family - friendly club and bringing @entity0 in would clearly have alienated a significant number of supporters			1
‘ it would also have inevitably embroiled the club in much controversy and distraction , at a time when we need to keep a complete focus on rebuilding the club and setting firm foundations for the future			0
‘ i therefore took the view that it would not be in the best interests of the club to seek a dialogue with mr @entity0 , notwithstanding his undoubted footballing talents			1
‘ neither i nor the club will be making any further comment on this matter			0
’ @entity1 allowed @entity131 , who was acquitted of rape when tried alongside @entity0 , to join the club on non-contract terms earlier in the season , but he was released after just one appearance			1
@entity0 ' loyal fiancee @entity52 has stood by him and is running the campaign to have his conviction overturned			2
ms @entity52 appeared alongside @entity0 in a recent video he made , in which he insisted he was guilty only of infidelity - not the rape he was jailed for			1
two years ago the victim had to start a new life away from her friends and family in @entity147 after nine people were convicted of illegally naming her in 2012 , but now may have to do the same again			2
the young woman was named at least 6,000 times on @entity151 alone following the conviction of @entity17 international @entity0 and was labelled a ‘ slag ’ , ‘ tramp ’ , ‘ bitch ’ and ‘ whore ’			0
police put her ‘ relocation package ’ together after her lifelong anonymity — protection afforded to anyone who has made and allegation of a sexual assault — was breached on the internet			0
some of the abuse amounted to ‘ psychological gbh ’ , to use the description of one senior detective , which left the girl ‘ traumatised ’			0
may 30 , 2011 : @entity171 shows footballer @entity131 meeting victim outside a kebab shop in @entity21 at around 4am , before taking a cab with her to a nearby @entity176			2
on the way he texts friend @entity0 to say he 's ' got a bird '			0
mr @entity131 and @entity0 both had intercourse with the girl , and at one point two other men tried to film it though a window			0

he claimed to have watched them before having sex with the victim himself , while two other men watched through the window and attempted to film it			0
april 23 : the victim is named for the first time online by supporters of @entity0 , who begin bombarding her with abuse that police will later compare to ' virtual @entity166 '			0
officers subsequently take the unusual step of giving the woman a false identity and moving her away from her home - protection usually reserved for high - profile murderers released from jail			0
august : @entity0 has request to appeal his conviction turned down , though this is later overturned by the @entity223 in @entity224			2
november , 2013 : @entity0 continues to deny guilt and recruits new legal team to help clear his name			0

november 22 : the @entity261 said while it can not comment on individual prisoners , in general terms the terms of a sex offender 's licence would render it near impossible to work abroad , scuppering any hopes that @entity0 may be signed overseas for the remainder of his sentence .			0
