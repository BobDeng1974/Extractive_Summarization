the paper 's reporter cites a ' mate ' of @entity4 as saying the fallen midfield magician has been spending hours on end at home drinking heavily and listening to @entity49 's tragically prescient song rehab on repeat			1
the @entity37 on sunday 's report appeared to contradict the @entity28 's , claiming that @entity4 would be taken straight from hospital to rehab , possibly the @entity54 in @entity55 that he attended last year			1

never meet your heroes : a policeman looks downcast as he escorts @entity4 , a man he probably idolised as a youth , to a waiting ambulance after his latest alcoholic breakdown came this week in the midst of his latest health scare , two builders have also described how they pulled the former @entity118 player from a bush following a suspected drinking session			0
@entity122 , 31 , and his brother @entity121 , 29 , helped @entity4 up after they saw two legs ' sticking out of the bush ' and found him rolling around and struggling to get up			0

prime : @entity144 showing off his silky skills against @entity146 at the semi-final of @entity148 in the most shocking chapter yet of his long and often very public battle with alcoholism , onlookers had dialled 999 after finding him slumped tearfully against a wall with his head in his hands at around 2.30pm			0
shortly before the ambulance had whisked him away , at 3.05pm , the former @entity14 star was seen calling a friend to plead : ‘ i ’m in trouble , please can you come and help me ? ’ @entity4 , who looks far , far older than his 47 years , was believed last night to be in @entity16			1
he had been observed drinking in public on several occasions in preceding days , and at lunchtime on tuesday was videoed by a passer - by in what appeared to be an inebriated state , in central @entity9			0
‘ you could smell the booze on him			0
he was hanging on me to stay up			2
he was absolutely battered , ’ said an onlooker			0
when he was taken into care 48 hours later , he appeared to still be wearing the same t - shirt .			0

former @entity14 ace is set to be discharged from hospital tomorrow
he then faces an intervention *summit* with friends and family , sources say
