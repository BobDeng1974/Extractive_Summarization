@entity0 says she and @entity1 are on the ' same page ' and plan to get married in the near future as @entity6 's redoubtable rugby captain , it 's likely @entity1 will be feeling the pressure when he steps out for this afternoon 's @entity9 match in @entity10			1
but even though the crucial game with @entity13 looks set to be the championship decider , the rugged 28 - year - old may well see it as blessed relief from the pressure he is under to make an honest woman of @entity0 , his opera - singing girlfriend of four years			1
he has n't actually proposed			1
but as @entity0 makes clear today , that 's no obstacle at all			1
' @entity1 and i are on the same page and we definitely plan to get married in the near future , ' the 26 - year - old tells @entity24 in her first interview about her famous boyfriend			1
' some people call it a pre-engagement			2
it 's all about timing – at the moment we 're both so busy with work			1
' i even had to spend @entity35 outside in the cold sandwiched between hordes of angry men as i cheered @entity1 on during his game			1
' ' @entity40 ' is a growing trend , with thousands of couples now choosing ' promise ' rings ahead of a formal proposal			2
@entity0 , though , has her eye on the real thing , and has been spotted scouting engagement rocks at @entity48			1
so far , her hulking 6ft 2in boyfriend has been notably reticent when friends have quizzed him on the subject			2
' it 's tricky now as i 'm currently locked away in the studio recording my third album and @entity1 is obviously incredibly busy and focused on his rugby and the @entity9			1
but he gets back from @entity6 camp in april and the @entity9 boys have some time off in may and weekends off in june , so we 'll have more time to ourselves then			2
as soon as things calm down for both of us work-wise , we 'll start making plans			2
' but she 's keen to point out there 's no pressure			1
' i am not pushing him , ' she adds			2
' nor are our mums , but all his friends are teasing him all the time			2
we 've been together for four years and are both each other 's serious long - term relationship			1
i expect that is why everyone is asking , but our futures are definitely together			0
we both agree on that			0
' four years ago @entity78 - born @entity0 – who has a @entity80 mother and @entity82 father and spent much of her childhood in @entity84 – was riding high with a successful operatic career			1
@entity1 asked for her number within two minutes of meeting her at a rugby event where she was singing			1
' my manager who was with me said i should n't give it to him , ' @entity0 confesses			1
' i said , ' of course i will			0
just look at him , he 's gorgeous			1
' but it took a month before we met			0
' at the time he was in @entity6 's second team , while i was working on my second album and my career was on a great trajectory			2
we decided to be monogamous when we started going out			0
' @entity6 captain @entity1 in action for @entity6 during a @entity9 match against @entity99 if the first test of their compatibility was tolerating the demands of each other 's careers , the next was both more serious and challenging			1
' my mother @entity107 was diagnosed with breast cancer in august 2011 , just after my second record came out and i was about to tour the country , ' @entity0 says			1
' it was followed by various complications so i cancelled the tour and all my singing engagements to look after her			0
' in 2012 @entity1 suggested i move in with him as he only lived a mile away from my parents ' home in @entity117 upon @entity118			1
it meant i could go to look after her easily every day			0
' we moved in together before we had been dating for a year , which would have strained lots of relationships but it did n't with us			2
he is easy to live with and there is no way i would have made it through without him			0
he was absolutely my rock			0
' he was equally supportive when the family finances were in a poor state and @entity0 tried to get back to work			1
' when my mother was ill my parents ' income dropped by half , ' she reveals			0
here the couple are pictured at the @entity138 in december 2012 ' i helped out but i was n't earning either and in 2012 i was bankrupt in all but name			1
the music industry moves on very fast and agents and people in the business who had been desperately asking me to do various concerts suddenly would n't take my calls			2
it was awful and i also discovered that many of the friends i thought i had were just celebrity hangers - on and were no longer interested in me			0
' despite the lack of a formal proposal , the couple have discussed in detail how they want to live their lives including , she says , the wedding			2
' when we first got together @entity1 told me he wanted children before he was 30 , ' she recalls			1
' he is 29 in june so that might have to change			0
' that is also the month her album is out , which should leave them free , she says , to think about wedding plans			0
' i do n't want a big wedding but @entity1 is quite keen , ' she insists			1
' so i think it will be low - key but pretty			0
i have my hair and make - up done every time i am on stage and wear ball gowns as a uniform , so it is not that important for me to dress up			0
for me , it is more about family and friends			0
' it 's every girl 's dream to have the perfect white wedding , but i think on her wedding day the bride should wear whatever she wants to make her feel special			2
' refreshingly confident about her own appearance , she continues : ' for some , if that means showing cleavage then so be it – especially if you 've got something to show			0
' if i do reveal any cleavage in my dress at least they 'll be real , not fake like some people assume they are			0
whenever i get my boobs out they always seem to spark raging debates about whether they 're real or not			0
i can tell you , they are completely natural			0
' is she worried about female fans trying to steal @entity1 away ? not at all , she says firmly			1
' obviously he is gorgeous , a complete catch and i am very lucky to have snatched him , ' she says , smiling			0
' equally luckily , he is not that type of man			0
he is kind , generous , humble and believes in loyalty			0
' loyalty is particularly important when you play for @entity6			0

@entity0 says she and @entity1 are on the ' same page '
the couple are ' pre-engaged ' , meaning he has n't yet popped the question
but @entity0 said the couple are planning to marry in the near future
@entity1 asked for the opera singer 's number at a rugby event in 2011
