@entity0 will seek to generate try - scoring potency against the @entity2 on saturday by unleashing another scratch combination out wide — @entity4 and @entity5			1
@entity7 wing may will return to the starting xv despite appearing to fall from favour on the summer tour of @entity2 and being unable to score in seven @entity11 appearances to date			1
his recall on the left flank comes as @entity15 of @entity16 continues to recover from a minor injury which prevented him from training last week			2
@entity18 , @entity0 ’s head coach , has had to deal with a series of injuries in the build - up to the @entity23 series at @entity24 , with the loss of @entity27 lock @entity26 being the latest grim development			1
@entity5 and @entity4 are expected to start on the wings against @entity2 @entity18 chose to omit @entity30 from his side in order to give @entity5 a chance to impress but he and his assistants chose to omit @entity30 from the national squad and in his absence , @entity5 will start on the right as the in - form winger in the @entity39 this season			1
when the line - up is officially confirmed on thursday the @entity42 - born flier will be at @entity44 to continue his astonishing career progression			2
the 27 - year - old joined @entity47 only two years ago and is still a serving soldier in the @entity49 having seen action in @entity52 ’s @entity51 as a tank driver with the famous ‘ @entity55 ’ armoured brigade			1
@entity5 will become the first serving soldier to win an international cap for @entity0 since @entity58 15 years ago			1
his test debut will complete an epic journey from his @entity42 village , @entity62 , where he could n’t break into the rugby team because his uncle was a better winger			2
having already lost @entity66 to a recurring groin injury , the coaches were forced to rule @entity70 centre @entity68 out of the autumn opener against the world champions because of a hand problem			2
it will mean that @entity0 do not have established try - scoring clout behind the scrum			1
among the backs who will start against @entity2 , scrum - half @entity77 has the highest tally , with seven			1
@entity82 has touched down five times , @entity84 twice and centres @entity85 and @entity87 once			2
in contrast , the @entity2 come to @entity24 armed with the most predatory finisher in the world			1
@entity92 has 29 tries from 30 @entity11 appearances			2
@entity30 had a decent record of 19 tries in 39 matches , but he has fallen out of favour due to perceived flaws in his game			0
explaining the thinking in terms of wing selection , @entity18 said : ‘ a lot of the players now — a @entity106 , @entity107 or @entity4 — are comfortable on either wing			1
the decision will be based on who we think are the best guys to deliver that balance in the back line — the ability to punch and get through the line , have the physicality and also have the back - field and defensive understanding that we ’ll need			0
' the @entity0 team warm up during a training session at @entity123 ahead of their match against @entity2 @entity125 star @entity84 practices his kicking during an @entity0 training session on monday referring to dealing with @entity2 ’s kicking game , he added : ‘ that reading of body language is key			1
that ’s one thing @entity4 and @entity106 did well in the @entity131 , particularly against @entity132 — @entity133 has a very accurate and intelligent kicking game			1
it ’s about being up in the line and also reading the body language to have the back - field covered			0
’ after having to contend with a stream of bad news relating to players ’ fitness , @entity18 had some brighter bulletins to savour on monday			0
his leading available props , @entity144 and @entity145 , were able to return to full training and @entity147 has recovered from concussion sufficiently to reclaim his starting place at @entity150			1
@entity84 appeared to be labouring on his most recent appearance for @entity125 , after a month out with a quad injury , but @entity18 said : ‘ there ’s no residue of injury whatsoever			0
in terms of the way he ’s making his decisions and leading the group , he ’s exactly where he left off with us in the second test ( in june )			0
’ @entity85 was another who was struggling last week , as he recovered from a rib injury			0
but he has been backed to line up at inside centre and make light of his first - half horror in @entity168 during @entity0 ’s last test , five months ago			1
‘ @entity85 has come back to @entity47 , he ’s been defensively excellent , a great attacking threat and he looks confident , ’ said @entity18			0
@entity0 ’s front - five options have been slashed by early - season injuries but @entity173 has no qualms about promoting @entity175 to partner @entity176 in the second row in place of @entity179			2
‘ they are quite similar players , ’ he said			0
‘ @entity175 is probably a stronger right - hand lock			0
he is a very good scrummaging second row			0
‘ he has changed his game this season — he ’s lost a bit of weight and played exceptionally well for @entity47			0
it was @entity175 ’s decision			0
he felt he could maintain his power but become more mobile around the field			0
but he ’s still a big fella and he will bring a physicality to our game because of his power			0

@entity7 wing @entity4 will return to the starting xv
@entity5 is expected to start on the right against the @entity2
@entity5 will become the first serving soldier to win an international cap for @entity0 since @entity58 15 years ago
