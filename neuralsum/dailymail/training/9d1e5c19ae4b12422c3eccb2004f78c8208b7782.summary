@entity0 failed to inspire a vapid @entity2 side as they fell to their first defeat of pre-season in his second debut with the club			1
the @entity8 forward capped his last @entity2 appearance with the winning penalty in 2012 ’s @entity12 final against @entity13 but back in @entity15 he – and @entity2 ’s other forwards - were starved of service in a game they deservedly lost courtesy of @entity20 ’s header and penalties from @entity22 and @entity23			2
@entity26 trio @entity24 , @entity27 and @entity28 along with @entity31 winner @entity30 return for pre-season training on monday and @entity33 will be glad of a boost to his creative options as @entity2 struggled to break down their @entity38 counterparts			1
@entity49 : @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity20 , @entity53 , @entity66 , @entity22			0
goals : @entity22 17 , @entity78 37 , @entity23 89			0
@entity2 : @entity39 ( @entity79 46 ) , @entity80 ( @entity81 70 ) , @entity82 ( @entity83 46 ) , @entity84 ( @entity85 76 ) , @entity51 ( @entity86 46 ) , @entity87 ( @entity88 46 ) , @entity89 , @entity90 ( hazard 57 ) , @entity56 , @entity92 ( @entity93 57 ) , @entity55 ( @entity0 46 )			2
subs not used : @entity95 , @entity96 , @entity97			0
but in truth @entity33 ’s @entity2 were disappointing on their fourth outing of this @entity101 pre-season tour – and the @entity43 boss will be glad to regroup at their @entity104 base when they return from @entity15			1
@entity84 handled in the area after 18 minutes to give @entity22 the chance to expertly convert a penalty past @entity39 and give @entity49 the lead			2
and @entity20 doubled the deficit 20 minutes later with a brilliant header that skimmed into the @entity113 debutant ’s bottom right hand corner			0
@entity2 on the other hand were poor – while @entity55 caused a nuisance up front the best chances of the first half fell to @entity90 and @entity92 who were both wasteful and looked lost on the flanks			0
nightmare debut : @entity0 will not be happy how his first performance back in blue shirt went disappointed : @entity39 looks disappointed having conceded two of @entity49 's three goals lost hope : @entity79 is beaten by a late penalty by @entity49 's @entity23 outplayed : @entity2 failed to deal with @entity49 's attacking players such as @entity22 poor show : @entity33 will be hoping his side can quickly recover from a setback against @entity49 @entity0 made his return to the side after the break but frequently found himself second - best to strong @entity49 centre back @entity72			1
@entity56 had @entity2 ’s best opening , latching onto @entity136 ’s ball across the box with 20 minutes left but his chipped effort left a lot to be desired and landed on the roof of @entity70 ’s net			1
to add insult to injury , substitute @entity23 then went on to make it 3 - 0 minutes before the final whistle after @entity93 ’s perfectly good last - ditch tackle was deemed to be a penalty by the referee .			0

@entity33 's side fail to beat @entity38 outfit @entity49
@entity0 played his first game for @entity2 since rejoining the @entity43
@entity136 comes on to play 33 minutes after linking back up with *squad*
