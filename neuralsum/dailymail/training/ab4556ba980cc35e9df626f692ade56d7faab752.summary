@entity0 , a bus conductor in his early twenties , spends his days travelling through the bustling streets of @entity3 in northern @entity4 , working hard to scrape a living			1
the pay is low and the hours are long , and @entity0 , like many of his colleagues , remains unwed and has no family			1
instead of going home come nightfall , he , and many others , spend their time with street children , paying them as little as 75p for sex and when they have no money , brutally abusing them			1
with girls kept at home by their parents , the majority of victims are boys - some as young as six years old			1
' once , there was a boy on the bus and everyone had sex with him , ' confesses @entity0 who admits to raping 12 different children during his career as a bus conductor			1
' i did it too but what else could i do ? they invited me			0
and he was that kind of boy anyway			0
' sexual abuse in @entity4 is rife			1
an estimated four million children in the country are forced into work from an early age due to poverty and of those , more than a million live on the streets where they are easy prey for men like @entity0			1
a recent survey of 1,800 men found that a third believe that not only is raping little boys not a crime , it 's not even a bad thing to do			1
as a result , an estimated 90 per cent of street children have been victims of sexual abuse at some point in their lives			1
damaged : @entity65 , 13 , has been on the streets , off and on , since running away from his violent brother who repeatedly beat him following their parents ' death			1
he was eight at the time dangerous : most of the street children are little boys and 90 per cent fall victim to paedophiles one such boy is @entity65 , 13 , who has been on the streets , off and on , since running away from his violent brother who repeatedly beat him following their parents ' death			1
he was eight at the time			0
his world is one of drugs and violence			0
he talks casually of a street where you 'll find ' all the paedos '			1
he is addicted to heroin and regularly abuses his own fragile body , cutting and stabbing himself in an attempt to deal with his anger			1
although he has sold himself to pay for drugs , he also tells , with tears in his eyes , of a time when he was attacked by a gang of men			1
' i was lying here sleeping and four people grabbed me and threw me into a car , ' he sobs			0
' one was a bus driver , the others were heroin addicts			1
all four of them raped me			2
' many of @entity4 's abusers are bus drivers			1
one man who knows this all too well is @entity107 , an entrepreneur who rents beds - and sometimes boys - to drivers at @entity3 's largest bus depot			1
' a bus driver rents a bed from me and he says he 'll pay an extra 50 ( 50p ) or 100 rupees ( £ 1 ) if i can get him a boy , ' explains mr @entity107			2
' there 's often a kid wandering the streets alone			2
we tell these boys we 'll provide food and shelter if they come with us			0
that 's how we lure them in			2
' others , addicted to the cheap heroin that pours across the border from neighbouring @entity126 , will have sex with these men for a price			2
' if i do n't make enough money picking trash , i sell my body , ' admits @entity134			0
' the first time i sold myself , i did n't have any money			0
' so i did it three times with a man and in return , he gave me 3,000 rupees ( £ 17 )			0
i was eight and a half			0
' the first time i did it , i had n't eaten for two to three days			0
afterwards , i cried all night , asking myself , " what have i done ? " i did this to myself to make some money			0
' hotspot : @entity3 's bus depots are the scene of much of the abuse with bus drivers being the main culprits drugs : thanks to the proximity of @entity126 and its cheap heroin , drug addiction is rife among street boys and @entity134 is n't alone			1
another street child , nine - year - old @entity156 has also been approached by men on the street but has so far managed to escape			1
' i do n't get scared if i have a friend with me , ' he says			0
' i get bothered a lot by the bus driver , the van driver			2
they tell me to climb on the roof of the bus and do bad things with them			2
sometimes they offer me a soft drink in return			0
' unsurprisingly , the impact of this abuse on the children is severe			2
along with psychological problems , a @entity176 report showed that as many as one in 10 are murdered by the men who abuse them			2
others go on to become abusers themselves , among them 13 - year - old @entity65			1
' there was a boy , about 10 or 11 , ' he confesses , shame - faced			2
chaos : the busy streets of @entity3 are also home to thousands of children - and some dangerous men hoping to help : @entity192 describes the plight of the street children as ' shameful ' for @entity4 society ' i took him to the cinema and spent money on him and he was ok with it			1
but when we left the cinema , he said he did n't want to do it anymore so then i grabbed his hand and forced him			0
' although there are laws in place to protect children , police rarely bother themselves with the plight of the street children , with many saying that the ever - present threat of @entity212 bombs trumps saving small boys			1
one man who might be able to help is politician @entity192			0
' it 's one of the most sad and shameful aspects of our society , ' he says			2
' i 'm totally embarrassed by this			0
it 's really shameful for us that we have not been able to protect them			2
' for now , boys like @entity65 continue to fall victim to predatory paedophiles like serial rapist @entity0 , a man who claims to want a ' good woman ' for a wife one day and children of his own			1
' i 'm going to look for a good wife who 's read the @entity230 and prays , ' he says			0
' a good , respectable woman			0
religion is very important because i 'm @entity233			0
' that , however , has n't stopped him from attacking boys			0
' what can we do ? , ' he whines			0
' we know it 's totally against @entity240			0
@entity241 does n't like it			0
but we 're helpless against our desire			0
' @entity4 's @entity244 , tonight at 10pm on @entity245			1
