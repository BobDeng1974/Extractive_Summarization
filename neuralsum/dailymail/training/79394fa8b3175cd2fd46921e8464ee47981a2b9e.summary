by @entity1 reporter published : 11:52 est , 9 march 2012 updated : 13:19 est , 9 march 2012 a couple is suing a health center for ' wrongful birth ' after a prenatal test intended to pick up whether a foetus has down syndrome failed - and their daughter was born with the condition			1
@entity11 and @entity12 , from @entity13 , @entity14 , who have two other children , said in a lawsuit they would have aborted their daughter @entity19 - who is now four - if they had known			1
they are suing @entity22 in @entity13 , which they claim conducted a botched test , for $ 3 million - the amount they believe they will have to pay over @entity29 's lifetime for her care			1
happy : @entity32 , pictured with her brothers , was born with @entity34 after a botched prenatal test failed to spot the condition			1
her parents are now suing for the costs of her extra care following a nine - day trial in @entity13 , jurors are now deliberating over a case that could have far - reaching - and questionable - implications for children born with with conditions such as @entity46 's			1
there are fewer than 10 ' wrongful birth ' cases in the @entity51 every year as prenatal tests are 99.7 per cent accurate - and few parents want to face a legal challenge if they do fail , the @entity47 reported			1
yet experts believe there could be a boom in the lawsuits as women in their late 30s and 40s are increasingly having babies and relying on genetic screenings to signal problems , the paper added			0
civil engineer @entity11 and dental hygienist @entity12 , who say they love @entity19 and intend to give her the same opportunities they have given their sons , were stunned when hospital staff told them she appeared to have @entity46 's			1
@entity12 , 39 , told doctors she had taken a test - a chorionic villus sampling , or @entity74 for short - before the birth and that the results had showed their child would be normal			1
' we were told we had nothing to worry about , ' @entity78 told jurors			0
parents : @entity11 , left , and @entity12 , right , claim they have received death threats for their comments sued : the @entity85 are suing @entity22 for $ 3 million as they believe staff botched their prenatal test but days after @entity19 was born , her mother was taking her to the doctor ' to show her off ' and he delivered the blow - a blood test confirmed the baby had @entity46 's			1
' it was devastating , ' mrs @entity12 said			2
the couple 's attorney @entity94 claimed in the case that dr. @entity97 removed tissue in the womb from mrs @entity12 , rather than from the baby , when he carried out the procedure at the clinic			1
the suit points the blame at the doctor and lab workers who did not realise they were testing maternal tissue , the @entity47 reported			0
tests carried out before a baby is born to determine whether they have any genetic disorders is called chorionic villus sampling , or @entity74 for short			2
it usually takes place between the 10th and 12th week of a pregnancy ,			0
the test is not given to every expectant mother , but some factors give rise to it			2
it is carried out if a woman has abnormal screen results in the first trimester of her pregnancy , or if there is a family history of genetic disorders or chromosome abnormalities			0
women over the age of 35 are also encouraged to have the test , as there is an increased risk of @entity34			2
it involves taking tissue from the foetus while in the womb and screening this sample for abnormalities			2
it also suggests that two later ultrasounds carried out by @entity142 showed traits of the syndrome , yet staff failed to recognise these , and assured mrs @entity12 her baby would be born normal and healthy			1
yet the attorneys for the defense claim @entity97 and the staff followed correct procedures			0
he suggested the problem was that the girl has mosaic down syndrome			0
whereas most people with the condition have cells containing an extra 21st chromosome , a significant number of @entity29 's cells did not , @entity97 said			2
nearly 31 per cent were normal			0
yet @entity94 countered that obviously 100 per cent of the cells taken in the @entity74 test were normal - as they had wrongly been taken from the mother			1
he added that tests carried out after @entity19 was born show there is less than one or two per cent normal cells			2
reports have previously quoted the lawsuit as demanding as much as $ 14 million to cover the cost of the young girl 's care			1
the couple has already whipped up a frenzy of hate and abuse for their comments over aborting their beloved daughter			2
@entity94 said they have received death threats , the @entity47 reported			1
the couple met in preschool , attended the same high school and college and married in 2000			0
civil engineer @entity11 and dental hygienist @entity12 , both 39 , are orthodox jewish , according to @entity189			1
their sons are in third grade and kindergarten			0
the boys , shown hugging their younger sister tightly in photographs , are bright - one has placed in the 99th percentile on standardised tests			2
legal team : @entity201 ( @entity202 ) said @entity19 has @entity46 's , so fewer cells contain the chromosome associated with the syndrome			1
@entity206 ( r ) said the clinic took tissue from the mother , not the fetus decisions : judge @entity212 is presiding over the case , which is being deliberated by a jury on friday the third pregnancy , when mrs @entity12 was 34 , was a ' surprise ' , according to the @entity14 paper			1
due to her age , the couple was vigilant about testing , undergoing the @entity74 at 13 weeks			0
it is believed one in 250 women at that age give birth to a child with @entity34			0
studies suggest that more than 89 per cent of women choose to abort a fetus with @entity34			0
after their daughter was born with the syndrome , the @entity85 expressed their fears over her future , including medical and social issues , and whether she would get the required educational support			0
experts have told them she will probably not be able to live on her own or support herself , the @entity47 reported			0
it is estimated she will live until her mid- 50s			0
she is able to speak in two - word sentences which only her parents and a few others understand , according to the @entity47			0
yet the @entity85 say @entity244 , who has down syndrome and earned a @entity247 degree , is a role model for their child .			0

a prenatal test showed couple 's daughter would be ' normal and healthy '
*shocked* when blood tests after the birth confirmed the baby had @entity46 's
botched test ' had taken sample from the mother rather than the foetus '
now @entity11 and @entity12 are suing @entity22 for $ 3 million
say they love their daughter - but have received death threats over the case
