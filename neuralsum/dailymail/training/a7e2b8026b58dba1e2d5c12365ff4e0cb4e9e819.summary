by @entity0 in @entity1 miserable : @entity2 , 17 , has begged her mother to let her return to the @entity4 from @entity5 a disruptive teen whose mother sent her - literally - to @entity5 is begging to come home to @entity4 after claiming she was beaten by her father and was so miserable she tried to commit suicide			1
two years ago @entity12 , 36 , from @entity13 dispatched her daughter @entity2 , then 15 , on a one - way trip to cold eastern @entity16 after a succession of arguments over her behavior			1
@entity22 , then a typical @entity4 teenager attending @entity21 , was born in @entity5 and has a @entity5 father - but she had n't lived there since she was two and did not speak any @entity16			1
despite this , she was packed off almost 6,000 miles to meet her birth father @entity25 - who spoke no @entity26 - as an apparent punishment for her teenage transgressions			1
originally she was told she would stay three weeks , but once in @entity5 , her mother - who is a @entity4 citizen - told her that it would be much longer , and she is now well into her third year in @entity16			1
since arriving there in march 2011 , she revealed how she was forced to quit her father 's home because he beat her and was often drunk			1
in a children 's center , with the possibility of being consigned to a grim orphanage , she tried to take her own life before going back to her father - because she thought if she did so her mother would allow her back to @entity4			1
her appeals to the @entity4 embassy and @entity42 's ombudsman for children , @entity38 , have all met with no response , she says			1
plea : she has written yet another letter ( pictured ) to her mother , who lives in @entity13 , but she said that she is not helping to speed up her return			1
she claims she has been beaten by her @entity5 father today she was tracked down by @entity48 to a @entity50 hostel where she lives and works a 60 hour week , including nights , to earn her keep and pay for her studies			1
now 17 , she penned a new heartfelt letter to her mother in her latest desperate bid to be allowed back from @entity5 where she says she has few friends and feels an outsider			1
' @entity57 all that is going on i really hope that our relationship could improve rather than be completely destroyed to shreds , ' she wrote			0
' i love you so much and i miss you and @entity64 ( her half - sister )			2
i want to come home			2
to come back to you			0
' i ask you one more time , please take me back			0
please find it in your heart to forgive my mistakes that i made as a pre-teen			0
you are the only family that i have			0
' fallout : her mother @entity12 said she will happily allow her daughter to return if she shows she 's changed her step - father @entity76 is an immigration attorney who has said her behavior as a teen was ' uncontrollable ' , including inviting boys home without permission			1
' the behavior was becoming worse and we saw no solution			0
worse , it was affecting the other children in the house , especially the outbursts that would last until 2am , ' he told @entity89 in an email			2
@entity22 is convinced he was behind her @entity5 punishment , and that without him , he mother would not have sent her into exile			1
@entity12 added : ' sending @entity22 to her father , grandparents , uncle , aunt , and cousin was not an easy choice that we had to make , but it was the right choice			1
' in fact , she no longer lives with her father and has hardly seen these other relatives , she said			2
@entity22 confessed that her behavior was poor before she was sent away - she once stole more than $ 1000 in cash , but she denies she ever took drugs and believes she has more than paid the price for any adolescent excesses			1
' i was 14 years old			0
i made many mistakes , ' she admitted			0
desperate : she said that she was forced to live in a children 's home and tried to commit suicide ' the one big mistake i made , i did take money			1
i entered into the room and just saw it			0
i do n't know why , i just took the money			2
' and then my mother asked me , where i got this money from and i panicked and i told her that i sold drugs			2
it was biggest mistake of my life			0
' i never did drugs , i never sold drugs			0
i told her later , that it was not true , that i stole the money			2
she told me - do you understand , you said that you sold drugs and it is too late now			2
' i was already here , when i told her			0
because after that day , i was on the plane two days later			0
it was one week after my 15th birthday			2
' she was put into a @entity16 school in the @entity5 outpost of @entity145 and only a friendly @entity26 language teacher helped her survive , she said			2
later she was helped to find a job in @entity50 , @entity5 's largest city where she works 60 hours a week			1
new home : @entity22 , who spoke no @entity16 when she moved to @entity5 , now lives in a hostel in @entity50 ' i pay for my school			1
i study via the @entity152			0
i want to graduate in an @entity4 school			0
and i just hope it is not a scam , ' she said			0
more than anything , her dream is to be home - in @entity4 - for @entity161			2
her mother has not closed the door on her but nor is she doing anything to fast - track @entity22 's return			1
' i begged her millions of times			0
i said , " i want my @entity57			0
i do n't have anything here ' , " she said			0
her case has been publicized in the @entity4 thanks to the heroic action of her school friends like @entity176 and @entity177 who can not bear the cruelty she is suffering			0
yet it is far from certain she will return to the @entity4			0
and if she turns 18 before being allowed back , and her birthday is next march , immigration rules will make it harder for her to return .			1

@entity2 was 15 when her mother sent her to @entity5 for 3 weeks to meet her father - but she was not allowed to come home
she and her parents say she was *misbehaved* at home , where she stole money and *disobeyed* her mother 's rules
her mom says she can only return when she has shown she has changed
@entity22 , who *insists* she has changed , says her father beat her and she tried to commit suicide while in a children 's center in @entity5
she now lives in a hotel where she works 60 hours a week
