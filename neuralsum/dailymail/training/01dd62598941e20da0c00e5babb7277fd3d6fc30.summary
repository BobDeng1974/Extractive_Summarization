the multi-millionaire is one of @entity5 's wealthiest artists you could hear the champagne corks popping all over @entity8 this week when the @entity9 in @entity8 announced the biggest corporate sponsorship deal it has ever struck : at least £ 5m over the next 11 years			1
their benefactor is the @entity14 car manufacturer @entity13 and you can see why the industry giant might want to forge links with @entity17			2
@entity18 gets more visitors than any other modern art gallery in the world : a whopping 4.7 million last year			1
it also has what must surely be the most magnificent spectacle any gallery has to offer : the view from the north - facing windows across the @entity28 to the majesty of @entity30			1
shame about the stuff inside			1
actually , that ’s not entirely fair			2
there is plenty of good stuff inside			1
but there is also a great deal of pretentious rubbish and the clue to why that is so lies partly in the gallery ’s name			1
there ’s a crucial distinction between ‘ modern ’ and ‘ contemporary ’ art. @entity46 dates back to around 1870 and the decades that followed gave us @entity49 and @entity50 , @entity51 and @entity52 and , of course , @entity54 in @entity55			2
contemporary art has given us such figures as @entity2 ( he of the diamond - encrusted skull and pickled shark ) and @entity61 and the @entity62			1
it may seem unfair to compare them to some of the greatest artists who ever lived , but that is what we are invited to do by galleries like the @entity17 , which hang their works alongside one another			2
most of us know precious little about what makes an artist great			1
we can , of course , employ the ‘ @entity81 ’ about art but i know what i like ’ formula — or we can put our faith in the experts			2
surely if art galleries around the country are stuffed to the gunwales with the work of a handful of artists whose work sells for vast amounts of money , that must prove something ? well , yes , but maybe not what you ’d think			1
the @entity96 ’s brilliant arts editor @entity95 , who was the director of @entity97 in a previous incarnation , has long been sceptical of the value of much that passes for contemporary art. so he did something very simple — and immensely revealing			2
he phoned the owners and directors of modern art galleries and , promising anonymity , asked how many of the artworks on their walls they thought had no right being there			2
they said at least a quarter of them			2
so why did they put them there in the first place ? because there is a serious conflict of interest in the art world that leads to what ceramicist @entity119 — himself one of our most accomplished artists , though often better known for his cross-dressing than his pots — describes as a ‘ conspiracy of silence ’			2
its root cause is that public museums and galleries around the world feel they have an obligation to show the work of so - called ‘ brand name ’ contemporary artists , but they struggle to survive financially			1
so a deal is struck			1
@entity2 poses in front of his artwork entitled ' the physical impossibility of death in the @entity139 ' in the @entity140 in april 2012 art dealers are more than happy to give a top museum a cut - price bargain on one of their artists because they know that if their work is shown in a major public collection it can hugely increases the value of the work			1
and if the dealer ca n’t quite afford to sell at such a low price he might solicit a contribution from one of his rich clients , who also just happens to collect work by the very artist in question			1
and there ’s another link in this chain of self interest			2
this wealthy individual might also be on the board of the gallery or museum , or a member of one of its many fundraising groups			2
the collector , like the dealer , stands to gain from an increase in the value of the artist ’s work now that he or she is represented in a major collection			1
so everyone ’s a winner			0
except you and me of course			0
if the curators shower praise on ‘ their ’ artists ’ work — even if some of it is palpably rubbish — how are we meant to know that they are effectively compromised ? ' if the curators shower praise on ‘ their ’ artists ’ work - even if some of it is palpably rubbish - how are we meant to know that they are effectively compromised ? ' as @entity95 told me , if they question the quality of an artist once he or she is represented in the institution ’s collection , they risk alienating the wealthy collectors and patrons and even the art dealer who might well represent other artists the museum would like to collect			1
the upshot is that any public debate about the quality of an artist ’s work — such as you expect in theatre , music or literature — is quashed because of compromises and conflicts of interest			1
as to the intrinsic quality of contemporary art and , @entity222 help us , ‘ conceptual ’ art , where the ‘ idea ’ behind the work is more important than the way it looks			1
well , here i ’m fortunate enough to have my own vast experience to draw on			0
two weeks at @entity230 to be precise			0
eight years ago i was foolish enough to take part in a @entity233 programme called @entity234			1
for ten nights the cameras watched me and four other ‘ celebrities ’ being taught to become artists			0
i agreed to appear because i ca n’t draw , ca n’t paint and if i ’m given a lump of clay to mould i end up producing something that looks exactly like a lump of clay			0
i hated it when my children asked me to draw a dinosaur , then wondered why i ’d drawn a dustbin with legs			0
i thought it unlikely that after a fortnight i ’d sketch like @entity252 or paint like @entity253 , but i did expect to learn something			0
i learned most conceptual art is banal , pretentious rubbish without merit or meaning			1
it does not become art because the ‘ artist ’ says so			0
perhaps my biggest mistake was expecting to be taught technique			0
every time i bleated at the teachers about it they ’d give me rather pitying looks and suggest that other things are far more important			1
it ’s true that an artist with skill but nothing to say is not a true artist			0
but if you do n’t have the basic skill you ca n’t say anything			0
the rot set in more than 40 years ago			1
@entity280 , an old friend of mine who ’s now a distinguished dealer in antiquities , was a student at the @entity284 after he left in the @entity285 , the word went out to art colleges around the land that traditional teaching was passe			0
modern artist @entity61 's ' to meet my past ' four poster bed a generation later one of our leading sculptors , @entity290 , said : ‘ i do n’t teach my students how to draw any more ; it ’s likely to ruin their career ’			0
so if not the basic skills , then what ? experimentation			0
@entity299 and i spent an afternoon in @entity230 messing about on a bed			0
our ‘ project ’ was to take an old mattress , a scruffy wig , a water melon and a set of kitchen knives and turn them into a work of art. i had a bit of fun stabbing the mattress with a knife and @entity299 stuffed bits of hair through the holes			1
it was hilarious nonsense , of course , but not according to the critic and curator @entity321 , who was wheeled out every afternoon to appraise our work			1
she informed us that we had brought out its ‘ mattressiness ’			0
i promise that was her word			0
thanks to the efforts of @entity299 and me , it had become a work of art. i ’m not suggesting for a moment that you can make good art only by applying paint to canvas or a chisel to a block of marble			1
of course artists must experiment with new materials and new techniques			0
in his early years @entity2 and many other @entity345 , as they became known , made many people see art in a different light			1
but great art must appeal to our hearts as well as our heads			1
as for my own artistic tastes , when asked to choose the one artist i ’d like to have hanging on my walls i ’d plump for @entity356 , which is a bit ironic in a way because he was , in his time , seen as something of an iconoclast			0
you can imagine his stuffier critics ridiculing some of his later works in which , instead of painting recognisable figures or solid objects , he would create an impression of what he saw			0
‘ @entity372 ! nothing but a charlatan , ’ they might have fulminated			0
‘ ca n’t make out a bally thing ! just a splodge of paint ! ’ what his admirers recognised was that he was painting the effects of light			0
in one of his most famous works , ‘ @entity386 ’ , the old warship is exquisitely portrayed in all its fine detail			0
but a few years later , when he painted a locomotive roaring towards him in ‘ @entity391 ’ , you can barely recognise any solid objects			1
you do n’t need to			0
the beauty and power of the painting makes you feel you ’ve been hit by the steam train itself			0
you wonder how he did it			0
it may be a truism , but one test of a great artist is surely whether his art survives			2
@entity356 not only survives in his own works but in the influence he had on other great artists — @entity50 in particular and the @entity411 movement that succeeded him			2
the great @entity5 artist @entity412 , famous for his trios of contorted figures , said art must speak ‘ directly to the senses ’			2
the only sense most contemporary art speaks to is the sense of ridicule .			0

@entity18 this week announced £ 5m sponsorship over the next 11 years
' there is plenty of good stuff in there . but there is a great deal of pretentious rubbish , ' @entity427 says
dealers give museums cut - price work as showing increases value , he says
