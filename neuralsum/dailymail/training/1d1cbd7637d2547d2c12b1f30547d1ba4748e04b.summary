@entity0 , 21 , from @entity1 said he was facing a lifetime of debt after his phone was stolen three days into his week - long trip on the @entity6			1
he assumed the @entity16 could not be used because it was password protected and only reported it stolen when he returned home in september			1
but he was horrified when a bill for £ 6,439.76 landed on his doormat a few days later			1
realising he had made a mistake he took out a 36 - month personal loan to pay off the debt , but when his next monthly bill came through it was £ 12,450.35			1
' it 's ruined my @entity28			0
i do n't know what to do			0
i was so shocked when i got the bill , ' he said			2
' i 'm a young lad and this will be hanging over me for the rest of my life			0
i 'm still paying off that six grand off			0
' i should n't be punished for the naivety of failing to report my mobile missing , or for the criminal acts of others who are the ones profiting from this			2
' mr @entity0 has been a @entity11 customer all his adult life and his contract includes unlimited @entity45 calls , unlimited texts and @entity47 of internet for £ 17.50 a month , but not overseas calls his first bill included his £ 17.50 contract fee £ 0.41 for messaging and mobile internet and £ 5,348.56 for calls with £ 1,073.29 in vat			1
mr @entity0 said @entity11 offered him little assistance in clearing the debt , so he decided to face up to his mistake and took out a loan to pay it back in november			1
but on december 4 he received a second demand for £ 12,450.35 because , according to @entity11 , the first bill did not cover the whole period before the number was cut off			1
this bill breaks down as £ 17.50 for the contract , £ 10,350.11 for calls , an admin fee of £ 2.94 , a late payment fee of £ 4.17 , a copy bill charge of £ 2.54 and vat of £ 2,074.36			2
he is now in negotiation with the mobile phone giant over the second bill			2
when he returned home and reported it missing he received a bill for £ 6,439 which included £ 17.50 contract fee £ 0.41 for messaging and mobile internet and £ 5,348.56 for calls with £ 1,073.29 in vat on december 4 he received a second demand for £ 12,450.35 which included more than £ 10,350.11 for calls but he is furious that the company allowed such a huge bill to be accrued without cutting off the phone			1
he said : ' @entity11 should not have allowed such ridiculous call charges to go uncapped			0
' they are really useless at helping out			0
they will just hang up or say they will contact you in three days			2
' i ca n't afford to pay the rest so i have to fight it			0
' they wo n't give me a final date on when this will be resolved , if it even will be			0
' i have a new 24 month contract with them			0
i ca n't even leave them			0
i have been a customer with them all my life and i get this			0
' since publicising his story , a spokesman for @entity11 said he would only be held liable for £ 500 of the fraudulent charges			0
' it is very easy for criminals to rapidly build up high charges using stolen phones , which is why we encourage customers to report phones missing as quickly as possible , ' said the spokesman			1
' customers are liable for charges up to the point they report the phone missing and we have the opportunity to bar it			2
' however , this would appear to be part of organised criminal activity and in recent weeks we have reviewed the extent of that liability in these cases			0
' following a review , mr @entity0 will be liable for £ 500 worth of the fraudulent charges			1
we will contact mr @entity0 to make arrangements to reimburse the payments already made less £ 500			2
' mr @entity0 ( right ) did not think his phone could be used because it was password protected and only reported it missing when he returned home after five days			1

@entity0 , 21 , did not report his iphone 4s as stolen for five days in @entity9
he did not think that it could be used because it was password protected
but when he returned home and reported it missing he received a £ *6k* bill
he took out a loan , but on his next bill it said he owed a further £ 12.5k
