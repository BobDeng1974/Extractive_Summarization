demanded that police arrest the students			2
it was thought her speech may have been her announcement of her desire to succeed her husband as mayor			0
what 's worse , the students had no intention of disrupting @entity123 's speech , but were merely travelling through the town on buses they 'd hired to take them to @entity7 for a remembrance service in honour of students massacred there in 1968			1
he admitted that many of the bodies had been badly burned which will make the process of extracting dna more difficult			0
