by @entity0 for @entity1 @entity2 , pictured , died after the brakes failed on his bicycle just hours after he had sent it in for a service to a shop in @entity8 , @entity9 it was a tragedy that is every parent ’s nightmare			1
as @entity15 looked on in helpless horror , his 14 - year - old son ’s bicycle careered out of control and into the path of a van , killing him instantly			1
witnesses described how the boy , @entity22 , pumped desperately at his brakes as he hurtled down a steep hill toward the busy road , but to no avail			1
now grief - stricken @entity15 and his wife @entity27 have launched a £ 300,000 @entity29 action against a bike shop that serviced the brakes on @entity22 ’s cycle just hours before the fatal accident , claiming negligence			1
the accident is a moment that will haunt @entity15 for ever			1
‘ i am reliving what happened every day , every moment , ’ he said			2
@entity15 , @entity22 and four others had been enjoying a bike ride through the @entity40 on a beautiful july day when tragedy struck			1
after the inquest , @entity15 explained : ‘ the path narrowed and became overgrown			2
my head was down , avoiding rocks and roots			2
but when i looked up , @entity22 was suddenly way ahead , the gradient had become steeper , the track rockier , and then , incredibly , i saw him struck by something moving left to right			2
one moment he was here , then he was gone			2
’ the accident happened just 30ft in front of him			1
‘ i dropped my bike and ran on to the road , ’ he recalled			1
‘ @entity22 was lying on the road			2
he looked like a young boy again			1
and then i was howling			0
crouched a few yards away , hands over my face			0
’ a coroner later ruled that there had been a ‘ complete catastrophic failure ’ of the front brake , and only partial functioning of the rear			0
but inquest rules prevented him attributing blame			0
the family are now suing @entity71 , the @entity8 bike shop that examined @entity22 ’s brakes just hours before the crash			1
@entity75 , owner of @entity71 , accepts that @entity22 had come into the shop and asked him to look at the gears and the rear brakes			1
giving evidence to last year ’s inquest , he said : ‘ i stand by my work and everything i did was correct			1
when that bike left the shop it was in a perfectly safe condition			1
’ @entity86 , pictured , described her son @entity22 as ' a teenager on the brink of manhood ' he conceded he did not hold any qualifications for repairing bikes but said he ‘ never felt the need to do so – i feel comfortable with my abilities ’			0
mr @entity75 adjusted the gears , replaced a worn rear brake cable and reset the rear brakes			1
@entity22 , of @entity99 , near @entity100 , @entity101 , had spent his savings on the ‘ long haul trucker ’ touring bicycle , which he had assembled himself			0
@entity15 , a writer and an experienced cyclist , had taken the bike for a ride two days before his son ’s death			1
he felt the brakes were ‘ functioning ’ but not ‘ optimal ’ – and told his son to get them checked out			1
he said at the inquest : ‘ i specifically said , “ we are really concerned about the brakes			1
you must get the front and back brakes looked at			1
’ @entity22 told his father that @entity71 looked over all the brakes and replaced a cable			1
‘ i did n’t have a go but i did try both front and back brakes , ’ @entity15 told the inquest			1
‘ i noticed they were much firmer now			0
’ that same afternoon – july 25 , 2012 – the party went for the fateful ride			0
describing the moments before the crash , mr @entity15 told @entity9 coroner @entity129 : ‘ we were n’t going that fast			0
we were cycling in tandem , then he was suddenly ahead of me			0
‘ it made no sense that @entity22 would n’t stop because you could see the road and there was plenty of time to stop			0
’ a witness , @entity140 , who lives nearby , said he heard the schoolboy screaming and saw him pumping his brakes			1
‘ he was standing up on the pedals , ’ said mr @entity140			0
‘ he was applying so much force to his brakes that he was trying to keep the bike stable			1
‘ i think i said to him words to the effect of “ come off			0
” he made no attempt to steer off the path			0
he made no attempt to come off the pedals and put his feet on the floor			0
’ @entity15 has given an insight into the pain the accident has caused to his family in a newly published book , @entity161 , which gives an emotional and honest account of the accident , its aftermath and memories of his son ’s life			2
‘ you could say that @entity22 had been born from a bike , ’ @entity15 has said			2
he and @entity27 met in 1987 as they took part in an @entity173 coast - to - coast ride with about 30 students			2
@entity27 was not on the ride which claimed her son ’s life , as she was in @entity177 , where she was chief executive of a bicycle company			0
in the book , @entity15 writes movingly of the moment that they removed the stabilisers from a four - year - old @entity22 ’s turquoise cycle as he sat with plastic knee - guards over his corduroy trousers			1
@entity186 , right , said he asked his son @entity22 , second left , to get the brakes on his bike checked professionally , pictured with his mother @entity27 , left and 12 - year - old sister @entity191 , front right ‘ as he wobbled and gathered speed to complete a childhood rite of passage , he cried in delight , “ i ’m doing it			1
” ’ the book is just one of the ways the @entity203 are keeping @entity22 ’s memory alive			0
they have set up a website in his honour and are working with cycle charity @entity208 to promote safer cycling routes			0
as well the lawsuit – brought under the @entity212 via their solicitors , @entity214 – the @entity215 have been campaigning for new legislation that mechanics should be qualified before they can be employed in bike shops			2
they raised the issue at the inquest , but the coroner dismissed it , saying he did not believe the government should create more red tape for small businesses			0
a ‘ to let ’ sign currently hangs over the @entity71 store in @entity8 , with neighbouring traders saying it closed for business a month ago			0
both parents – who also have a daughter , @entity191 , two years younger than @entity22 – have paid moving tributes to their son in newspaper articles			0
@entity27 has written : ‘ those who knew him say he had an extraordinary mix of social skills and intelligence for his age ... he was a young teenager on the brink of manhood and had all the promise of being an amazing contributor to the world			0
’ and @entity15 has said : ‘ the day after @entity22 died , my wife and i woke up in a terror			0
is it true ? is he gone ? how can it be possible ? that our generous , kind , smart , quirky , assured , beautiful boy could be gone			2
‘ the pain was massive , unbearable			0
how were we supposed to live in this world ? ’ now he and his wife can only wait for a judge to decide whether negligence cruelly tore their son away .			2
