warning : property agent @entity0 predicts £ 50,000 bills to the @entity2 just to stay in your home a powerful new lobbying group containing dozens of the country ’s super-rich – and backed by a @entity9 mp – has been set up to thwart moves to introduce a mansion tax			1
the secretive outfit hopes to overturn public support for the proposed levy on multi-million - pound homes by arguing that it is ‘ economically illiterate ’ and would trigger a devastating crash in property prices			1
chancellor @entity19 has repeatedly blocked efforts by the @entity21 to impose the annual tax of 1 per cent on homes worth more than £ 2 million – but @entity25 leader @entity24 has vowed to introduce it if he comes to power in next year ’s general election			1
@entity30 mayor @entity29 has launched an outspoken attack on the proposed tax , describing it as ‘ brutally unfair ’ and saying it is ‘ time that people woke up to the horror of what is being planned ’			1
in an article for today ’s @entity38 , mr @entity29 says : ‘ @entity25 and the @entity21 would have you believe that the people they want to hit are oligarchs and international bankers			1
‘ but the overwhelming majority of victims would be @entity45 who find themselves living in a house that has nudged over the threshold			2
‘ that includes people who currently have no idea of the risk they face			0
‘ it is hard to think of a tax that is more viciously unfair			0
it hits families who have worked hard and traded up the property ladder only to find themselves walloped for their success			1
’ mr @entity29 ’s robust intervention is bound to lead to further speculation about his political ambitions at @entity61			0
the new lobbying group , organised by a property mogul who operates in some of the capital ’s most exclusive areas , was discreetly launched last november at a meeting in a @entity68 restaurant attended by 65 of the richest people in the @entity45 – including @entity71 oligarchs and multi-millionaires from the @entity73			1
they were addressed by @entity9 mp @entity75 , who urged them to ‘ donate to the @entity79 ’ if they wanted to stop the levy			0
chancellor @entity19 has made repeated blocks to the @entity21 motion but now @entity24 has pledged to carry it through despite @entity9 opposition , @entity21 leader @entity83 has warned that the tax , which would affect about 60,000 homes , would be a ‘ die - in - the - trench policy ’ in any future coalition negotiations			0
it would mean that the owner of a £ 2.5 million house having to pay £ 25,000 a year to the @entity2 just to stay in their home			1
mr @entity24 ’s support means that only a @entity79 majority at the election is now likely to prevent it being introduced			0
last night , mr @entity75 , the @entity9 mp for @entity99 and a shareholder in a property development company , said : ‘ i am all for everyone paying their fair share to help the economy , but this is not the right way to go about it			2
’ mr @entity75 ’s £ 3.5 million house in @entity109 , @entity30 , would result in him having to pay £ 35,000 annually			2
@entity0 , the luxury property agent who has set up the group , predicted that the tax would cause owners to sell their homes en masse			1
@entity83 has told cameron the tax will be his ' die - in - the - trench policy ' in any future negotiations ‘ three out of four enquiries we get about homes above a certain value now concern the tax , ’ he told @entity38			0
he claimed a typical salary for someone in a £ 5 million house is about £ 150,000 a year , leaving them less than £ 100,000 in take - home income – around half of which would have to be paid to the @entity2 in tax			1
‘ there would be no alternative but for them to sell , which would cause a crash in property prices all the way down the scale			1
and not just in the capital , the ripple effects would be felt far and wide			0
’ he declined to identify the guests at the meeting or even the restaurant where they met			2
mr @entity0 has sold more than £ 3 billion of property for clients including @entity45 ’s richest man , @entity149			1
he added : ‘ we need to get the message across – this is not about rich people furthering their own interests			0
' it will raise a tiny amount of money in the scheme of things , perhaps £ 1 billion , but cause mayhem in the process			2
it is economically illiterate and class warfare			0
the politics of envy are back			0
’ opponents of the tax also say the tax would require a new bureaucracy to value every home , and an expensive appeals procedure			2
the construction trade would be hard hit , and foreign investors deterred from settling in the country			2
mr @entity0 , 60 , added : ‘ the @entity21 and @entity25 feel this primitive tax has been very well received amongst their core voters			0
as might be the erection of 20 crucifixes along the @entity180 with bankers firmly pinned to them , but that does not make it good policy ’ .			0
