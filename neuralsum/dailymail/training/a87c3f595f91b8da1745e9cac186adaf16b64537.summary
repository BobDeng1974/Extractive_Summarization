@entity0 , as always , had an idea			2
not content with beating opponents with style , he wanted teams to be trembling at the mere sight of @entity6			1
so , having watched @entity7 and been struck by the stunning simplicity of their white kit , @entity0 made a radical change on november 25 , 1964			2
in a @entity13 tie against @entity14 at @entity15 , @entity6 wore all red for the first time in their history and never looked back			1
‘ he thought the colour scheme would carry a psychological impact , ’ @entity19 , who scored the first goal that night , would later recall			2
‘ @entity24 for power , red for danger			2
’ tuesday marked the 50th anniversary from when @entity6 changed their kit from white shorts to all red on the 50th anniversary of that seismic change , when @entity6 stopped wearing white shorts and socks , @entity31 used words that @entity0 would have expected in conjunction with a red shirt - resilience , spirit , character - but not from a front - foot position			1
this has been a chastening period for the current incumbent of the @entity15 manager ’s seat , a run of four consecutive defeats sending @entity6 ’s campaign to the brink of crisis			1
no longer a garment to elicit fear , it has been the outfit this campaign of a team perceived to be a soft touch			2
in the wake of sunday ’s capitulation at @entity62 , @entity59 columnist @entity58 led the criticism , lambasting his old team ’s mental weakness			1
as @entity6 look to preserve their @entity13 status here in @entity68 on wednesday , @entity31 explained why he saw things differently			1
‘ we hear criticism of the team but this team has character - it showed it last season , ’ said @entity31			1
‘ it has got resilience			2
ok , we concede more than we would like at times but you ca n’t question the character			2
it ca n’t be criticised			2
we have players who ’ve shown they have spirit			2
@entity6 boss @entity31 has come under fire for the club 's poor displays this season @entity6 's defeat to @entity62 was their fourth straight in all competitions if @entity87 pick up more points than @entity6 , then @entity31 ’ side are out			1
if @entity87 lose , @entity6 could still survive for the final match - day , even if they lose to @entity90			1
if @entity6 win , it will all come down to their final group match against @entity87 next month			1
‘ but when you do n’t get victories it is life			2
if you do n’t do it with confidence you do n’t do it quite as good			2
my job is to keep instilling it			2
it ( being easily beatable ) is a comment that has been made			0
it ’s something when you ’re paid to be critics - well , not critics - but to assess the team			1
‘ when you lose games , what i ’ve learnt is that people will say what they want			0
i ’ve said before whether criticism is deserved or not you wo n’t like it			0
you just have to ignore it , you just have to not listen to it			0
i have a team full of characters , full of people fully committed			0
‘ hopefully that ’s something that will improve			0
but we need to improve , we need to be better			0
you talk about sport - you need to have persistence , you need to have resilience			1
that persistence gets you through			0
losing can be the making of you			0
’ that last point is debatable			0
@entity31 has never lost five consecutive games as a manager but if the current sequence extends and @entity6 falter against opponents who pushed them so close at @entity15 in september , the atmosphere on @entity127 will descend further			1
despite the bad run of form , @entity31 ( left ) is adamant the squad 's character will see their fortunes change the @entity6 squad were put through their paces in training on tuesday ahead of their @entity13 tie @entity31 , to his credit , never ducked an issue on tuesday night and , describing his role as one of the ‘ pillars of the team and the club ’ , he set a positive tone			1
he is not in the mood to dwell on the wretched results that have tumbled one after another			1
there was , though , realism and pragmatism in his message			0
@entity31 ’ dream maybe to inflict ‘ death by football ’ on teams but he is not going to kill @entity6 ’s campaign by pursuing it to the detriment of everything else			1
that is why in the @entity164 , he will make @entity6 something they have n’t been - difficult to beat			1
@entity167 midfielder @entity166 will come in to bolster the midfield , enabling @entity169 to move forward , and @entity170 will return , to plug the holes @entity172 has been leaving			0
midfielder @entity166 ( right ) is expected to start alongside @entity169 for wednesday 's clash in @entity68 ‘ that ( getting a result ) has been the case now for a number of weeks , ’ said @entity31			1
‘ the philosophy is important and we know how we want to work but you need to get results			1
you need to find results			1
we would take a scrappy win			0
‘ listen , you ca n’t play perfect football			0
it is going to be tough			0
we want to get a result			0
’ and why does he retain faith that they will leave their moribund form behind and , somehow , sneak a place in the knockout stages ? ‘ it is sport , ’ he replied			0
if we did n’t feel that we could , we may as well pack up and go home			0
we all work tirelessly at our jobs			0
i am a better manager than i was 12 months ago because of experience			0
‘ the players are working so , so hard and are fully committed			0
we need to improve but when the tide turns - which it will do - we will be in a better place to move on			1
sometimes it just takes a game , an action to change a season for you			0
we have to believe that can happen			0
’ @entity170 ( right ) is expected to play in central defence at the expense of @entity172 against @entity90			1

@entity6 travel to @entity90 for wednesday 's @entity13 tie
@entity217 lost 3 - 1 to @entity62 in the @entity218 on sunday
@entity31 ' side could be knocked out of the @entity13 on wednesday depending on results in their group
