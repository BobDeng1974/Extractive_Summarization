ignorant : @entity0 did not know it was illegal to have sex with a 13 - year - old girl a muslim who raped a 13 - year - old girl he groomed on @entity7 has been spared a prison sentence after a judge heard he went to an @entity11 faith school where he was taught that women are worthless			1
@entity0 , 18 , claimed he was not aware that it was illegal for him to have sex with the girl because his education left him ignorant of @entity18 law			2
yesterday judge @entity19 handed @entity0 a suspended sentence , saying : ‘ although chronologically 18 , it is quite clear from the reports that you are very naive and immature when it comes to sexual matters			2
’ earlier @entity26 heard that such crimes usually result in a four to seven - year prison sentence			1
but the judge said that because @entity0 was ‘ passive ’ and ‘ lacking assertiveness ’ , sending him to jail might cause him ‘ more damage than good ’			0
@entity0 , from @entity33 , admitted he had sex with the girl , saying he had been ‘ tempted by her ’ after they met online			1
they initially exchanged messages on @entity7 before sending texts and chatting on the phone over a two - month period			1
they then met up in @entity26 , where @entity0 had booked a room at a @entity45			1
the girl told police they stayed at the hotel for two hours and had sex after @entity0 went to the bathroom and emerged wearing a condom			2
@entity0 then returned home and went straight to a mosque to pray			0
he was arrested the following week after the girl confessed what had happened to a school friend , who informed one of her teachers			0
he told police he knew the girl was 13 but said he was initially reluctant to have sex before relenting after being seduced			2
encounter : @entity0 and the girl had met randomly on @entity7 and had also communicated by phone and text messages for two months before they met earlier the court heard how @entity0 had ‘ little experience of women ’ due to his education at an @entity11 school in the @entity18 , which can not be named for legal reasons			1
after his arrest , he told a psychologist that he did not know having sex with a 13 - year - old was against the law			1
the court heard he found it was illegal only when he was informed by a family member			0
in other interviews with psychologists , @entity0 claimed he had been taught in his school that ‘ women are no more worthy than a lollipop that has been dropped on the ground ’			1
when judge @entity19 said @entity0 ‘ must have known it was illegal , unless he was going round with his eyes shut ’ , defence lawyer @entity87 said reports suggested @entity0 had a ‘ degree of sexual naivety ’			0
‘ the school he attended , it is not going too far to say , can be described as a closed community and on this occasion this was perpetuated by his home life			0
@entity0 had pre-booked a family room at the @entity101 in @entity102 , @entity26 where he took his victim sentenced : @entity0 admitted at @entity26 ( pictured ) that he had sex with a 13 - year - old after she ' tempted ' him ‘ it is not too far to say that he may not have known that having sex with a 13 - year - old girl was illegal			1
’ judge @entity19 sentenced @entity0 to nine months youth custody , suspended for two years , along with a two - year probation supervision order			1
describing @entity0 , the judge said : ‘ he ’s had an unusual education , certainly in terms of the sexual education provided			0
comparing women to lollipops is a very curious way of teaching young men about sex			0
’ but he said that @entity0 knew what he was doing was wrong			0
‘ it was made clear to you at the school you attended that having sexual relations with a woman before marriage was contrary to the precepts of @entity11 , ’ he said			0
addressing @entity0 , the judge said : ‘ i accept this was a case where the girl was quite willing to have sexual activity with you			2
but the law is there to protect young girls , even though they are perfectly happy to engage in sexual activity			0
