by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 03:30 est , 25 october 2012 updated : 19:31 est , 25 october 2012 @entity2 has bounced out of double - dip recession following the strongest growth figures for five years			1
the nation 's output leapt by 1 per cent in the three months to september , far faster than experts had forecast and boosted by the @entity8 and , indirectly , the @entity9			1
chancellor @entity10 welcomed the news – the best quarterly growth since the collapse of @entity14 in 2007 – but was careful to warn that the economy still faces serious difficulties			2
@entity36 renewed its calls for more government spending and a cut in @entity40			0
@entity42 deputy governor @entity41 , however , declared that @entity2 's economy was past the worst			1
' looking at the @entity2 economy , the expectation is growth should be picking up , ' he said			1
' there is bound to be volatile movement from quarter to quarter , but the underlying trend is for growth			0
' the chancellor , who was under pressure following negative economic figures for the previous nine months , agreed there were encouraging signs that the economy was healing			1
' @entity2 is recovering from a very deep banking crisis , ' he said			0
' but today you can see that the @entity2 economy is on the right track			2
' however he warned against complacency : ' there are plenty of risks out there			0
look at the data from the eurozone this week that shows us that there is still a difficult economic situation in the world			0
' mr @entity10 was scathing about the advice from mr @entity33 , branding him ' the man more responsible than almost anyone else for what went wrong in the @entity2 economy '			1
prime minister @entity29 welcomed the gdp figures during a visit to @entity80 in @entity81 , @entity82 - west @entity23 today mr @entity29 , who met tool technician @entity83 , said the growth figures figures ' show we are on the right track ' he said : ' the prescription the @entity36 offers is the same prescription that got us into this trouble			1
this coalition government is taking a different approach , which is that @entity2 has to confront its problems – rebalancing that economy , healing that economy is what we 're all about			2
' mr @entity33 , who last year denied that @entity36 had been running a structural budget deficit , yesterday acknowledged there had been one			1
the @entity101 confirmed the @entity102 was running a structural , or long - term deficit of 5.2 per cent of gdp in 2007 , or £ 73billion – the biggest in the @entity106 group of leading nations			1
the @entity29 posed on the steps of @entity109 to mark the @entity111 poppy appeal minutes before the @entity112 confirmed @entity2 was out of recession on the latest economic figures , mr @entity33 said : ' our economy desperately needs an injection of confidence			1
but this is no time for complacency and wishful thinking			1
' the gdp figures rounded off a good run of economic news in recent weeks which has seen inflation fall to 2.2 per cent having peaked at 5.2 per cent last year , unemployment drop to 7.9 per cent , and employment hit a record high of nearly 30million			2
the government has also borrowed far less than feared so far this year – giving the chancellor a fighting chance of hitting his budget targets as he battles to cut the record deficit racked up by @entity36			1
but economists warned that ' underlying ' growth in the economy is not as strong as the latest figures suggest			0
the sale of @entity8 tickets added 0.2 per cent to @entity104 in the third quarter			1
the @entity9 in june , although it fell in the previous quarter , also helped indirectly			0
this was because between july and september companies clawed back the 0.5 per cent of output lost because of the extra bank holiday from the jubilee			0
@entity146 , chief economist at currency exchange company @entity147 , said the economy is ' bouncing along the bottom '			0
he said : ' while this is undoubtedly a welcome surprise , upon breaking down the numbers we should not get caught up in a flurry of champagne corks and party poppers			0
we are not out of the woods yet			0
' the @entity112 figures showed the dominant services sector rose by 1.3 per cent in the third quarter while industrial output was up 1.1 per cent			2
but the construction sector shrank 2.5 per cent as builders continued to bear the brunt of the downturn			2
the prime minister bought his poppy on the steps of @entity109 minutes before the gdp figures were published the economy is still 3.1 per cent smaller than it was before the crisis struck and just 0.6 per cent bigger than it was when the chancellor delivered his spending review two years ago			1
@entity175 , an economist at fund manager @entity176 , said underlying growth was probably about 0.3 per cent after the boost from the @entity8 and @entity179 was excluded			2
' that is not strong enough to shield the @entity2 from the external risks that partly contributed to the latest recession , ' he said			0
' in our view , the @entity2 remains at high risk of a ' triple - dip ' recession in 2013			0
' chancellor @entity10 insisted he was ' working hard ' to fix the economy mr @entity29 risked angering the statistics watchdog yesterday when he drops in inflation and unemployment would be followed by more ' good news ' video : ' economy is on right track ' says @entity29 , as economy climbs out of recession			0

the economy grew by higher than expected 1.0 per cent in the three months from july to september , the @entity112 said
best growth figures for five years after downturn left average @entity2 £ *1,800* - a - year worse off
the prime minister warns there is ' still a long way to go '
@entity8 and @entity208 ticket sales contribute 0.2 per cent growth but construction industry *shrinks* by 2.5 per cent
@entity36 's shadow chancellor @entity33 warns this is ' no time for complacency and wishful thinking '
*business* groups give figures a *cautious* welcome
