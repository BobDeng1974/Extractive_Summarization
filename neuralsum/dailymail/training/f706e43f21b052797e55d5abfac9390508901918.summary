@entity1 wireless customers may want to take a closer look at their old phone bills because they may have money coming back to them			1
the @entity5 said wednesday that @entity1 , a subsidiary of the telecom giant , has agreed to a hefty $ 105 million settlement after the government accused the company of unlawfully billing customers for hundreds of millions of dollars in bogus charges - a practice known as cramming			1
the multi-agency settlement includes $ 80 million that will be paid to the @entity5 for consumer refunds			1
one state attorney general compared what @entity1 did as amounting to picking the pockets of consumers			2
@entity20 hq : @entity1 has been ordered to pay fines and compensation totaling $ 105 million to the public and all 50 states according to the complaint , the charges appeared on @entity1 phone bills but were from third - party companies for services people never asked to receive or were duped into subscribing to - things like horoscope texts , celebrity gossip or flirting tips			1
the fees were usually around $ 9.99 a month and were not easy for customers to find on their bills			2
the @entity5 says @entity1 kept at least 35 percent of the unauthorized charges it imposed on customers			1
in 2011 alone , @entity1 received more than 1.3 million calls to its customer service department about the charges , the commission said			2
' this should have and , in fact , did ring alarm bells at @entity1 , ' @entity5 chairwoman @entity46 said at the settlement announcement			0
' but instead of acting to stop the charges , @entity1 continued to make hundreds of millions of dollars from the practice			2
' @entity54 chairman @entity53 said the settlement should serve as notice to wireless carriers that unauthorized charges on phone bills will not be tolerated			1
in a statement , company spokesman @entity60 said the settlement resolves ' claims that some of our wireless customers were billed for charges from third - parties that the customers did not authorize			0
' he said @entity1 last year discontinued third - party billing for premium short messaging services			2
those services offer ringtones or messaging programs provided by other companies and typically rely on text messages sent to consumers to initiate charges			0
from the settlement , an additional $ 20 million in penalties and fees will go to 50 states and the @entity84			1
another $ 5 million will be paid to the @entity54			2
@entity54 chairman @entity53 said the settlement should serve as notice to wireless carriers that unauthorized charges on phone bills will not be tolerated			1
the third - party fees were listed on wireless bills as ' @entity91 , ' leading customers to believe the charges were part of services provided by @entity1			1
sometimes , third - party companies randomly pick phone numbers of people to sign up for their ringtones or texts without their knowledge or consent			0
@entity5 chairwoman @entity46 said consumers were often hit with $ 9.99 charges lumped together into " @entity1 monthly subscriptions " on their bills			1
other cramming might involve third - party vendors who offer gift cards , telling would - be recipients that they need to enter a contest for the card by providing their cell number and texting back a certain pin number			0
the vendors then would start charging customers ' phone accounts for recurring charges unrelated to the gift - card offer			0
under terms of the settlement , @entity1 will be required to get consumers ' consent before placing any third - party charges on their bills			1
customers also must have the option to block any third - party charges from being placed on their bills			0
consumers seeking refunds should go to the @entity5 's website , where they can make a claim for charges dating back to 2009			0
people will need to submit their nae , phone number and account number if they have it			0
refund representatives can then search bills for unauthorized charges			1
this is the @entity5 's seventh mobile cramming case since 2013			0
in july , the commission sued @entity145 in federal court in @entity147 , accusing the mobile provider of wrongly charging customers for premium services they never authorized			0
@entity145 has said it was already offering refunds to customers for those charges .			0
