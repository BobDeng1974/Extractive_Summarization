@entity0 ca n’t win anything without kids at the moment			0
after 18 - year - old @entity5 inspired their opening day win over @entity7 they made it two wins in two thanks to 19 - year - old forward @entity11			1
@entity13 ’s team dominated @entity14 but despite superb displays from @entity16 and @entity17 they owed their 1 - 0 win to their young @entity20 striker who scored the only goal of the game eight minutes from time			1
last week ’s hero @entity5 was picked to start ahead of @entity24 and he had his first chance after five minutes when @entity17 fed @entity16 who crossed for the young striker but his shot was smothered by @entity28			1
@entity72 , the third man in @entity0 ’s attack , had his first chance on 15 minutes but @entity28 again was able to make the save			2
@entity17 was being whistled by a mindless minority of home fans			0
the last time he was at @entity86 he was racially abused by a supporter who threw a banana at him and he reacted by peeling the banana and taking a bite			0
the action gave rise to the ‘ somostodosmacacos ’ ( we are all monkeys ) anti-racisim campaign			0
the @entity96 was a constant threat but @entity14 were finally finding their feet and had their best chance of the first half on 23 minutes when @entity64 crossed from the right			2
the centre evaded everyone and @entity46 was all alone at the far post onside and with the chance to put @entity14 ahead			1
he made poor contact with the ball and sent his effort over @entity65 ’s bar			0
@entity0 almost punished @entity14 immediately when they counter-attacked through @entity16 and @entity72 was played in only to be fouled in the box by @entity56			1
the penalty was not given and the chance was gone			0
@entity16 then hit the post with a free - kick that hit midfielder @entity62 and and was pushed onto the frame of the goal by @entity28			1
@entity0 continued to threaten down their right with @entity69 releasing @entity17 and the full - back winning a corner which came to nothing			0
@entity121 was refereeing the game – the @entity123 was in charge of the @entity126 v @entity125 at the @entity127 in which @entity24 suffered a fractured vertibrae			2
he booked @entity17 five minutes before half - time when the defender complained of a kick from @entity14 ’s @entity50			1
with @entity0 no closer to breaking the deadlock at the start of the second half coach @entity13 made his first change on the hour and it was @entity24 , who after a strenuous warm - up that also included signing autographs , replaced @entity5			1
@entity0 almost scored immediately with @entity69 finding space inside the penalty area but dragging his cross-shot wide			0
knock it and run ! @entity72 skips beyond @entity14 captain @entity61 in an attempt to find the opening goal making himself known : @entity0 manager @entity13 bellows orders to his players still the crosses rained in from @entity17 ’ right wing but there was no - one to convert them and @entity16 was getting increasingly frustrated			1
he went close with a free - kick that @entity28 pushed out for a corner and from the resulting kick the @entity154 headed well wide			1
@entity0 then had their best chance so far			0
@entity16 crossed from the right and the ball dropped to @entity24 almost on the goal line			1
the @entity96 only had to lift it over @entity46 who had gone to ground but instead he blasted against the defenders legs and watched it cannon away to safety			0
@entity165 ’s next chance was much more difficult but again it was one you would expect him to score			0
this time he leaned back and lifted his effort over @entity28 ’s bar			0
down at the other end @entity171 hit the post as @entity0 were almost made to pay the ultimate price for their poor finishing			2
it was the cue for coach @entity13 to turn to @entity71 who replaced @entity70			0
@entity0 ’s favourite route to goal did not change and neither did the result – yet another @entity17 cross reached @entity16 and this time his first time shot came back off the outside of the post			2
@entity0 were enjoying 75 per cent of possession but were still missing the finish until minute 82 when substitute @entity186 who had replaced @entity72 midway through the second half turned the ball in from a yard out – from almost the same place @entity24 had missed his earlier sitter			1
neymar it was who played in @entity16 he tricked his way to the byline and when keeper @entity28 was unable to block his cross it reached the young b - team forward who made no mistake			2
bit of a tussle : @entity61 holds off @entity72 as the @entity123 attempts to nip beyond him out wide tough tackler : @entity0 's @entity205 steals possession off @entity57 in the @entity208 battle			2

@entity24 came off the bench to play his first game of the *season*
@entity16 hits the post from deflected free - kick
@entity11 replaced @entity72 in the 71st minute before *notching* the winner
@entity60 hit the *woodwork* for @entity14 as they had sensed *victory*
