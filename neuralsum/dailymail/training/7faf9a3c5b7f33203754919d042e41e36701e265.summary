@entity0 has become the first city in @entity2 to ban 3d - printed guns amid fears such bootlegged firearms could fuel a surge in violent crime			1
lawmakers of @entity2 's fifth biggest city passed a bill on thursday , six months after the blueprint for the @entity10 gun known as the @entity11 was made available online by the group @entity16			1
in may , the @entity17 demanded the design be taken offline on the basis that they could violate possible arms trafficking violations , but not before it was downloaded more than 100,000 times			0
' it ’s all pre-emptive , ' spokesman @entity23 , director of legislation for bill - author @entity25 , told @entity27			0
' it ’s just based upon internet stuff out there			0
' no toy : it comes six months after the blueprint for the 3d gun known as the @entity11 was made available online by the group @entity16 new technology : an @entity37 printer			1
the blueprints , that can be produced on a @entity37 printer costing as little as $ 1,000 , were seen as a breakthrough because no one has previously designed such a weapon that could withstand the pressure of firing modern ammunition according to @entity46 crime statistics , @entity0 reported 331 murders in 2012 , ranking it among the most violent cities in the @entity2			1
the decision comes a week after the @entity11 was deemed a serious safety and security concern after a gun printed by the @entity53 exploded before it was even fired			1

dangerous city : according to @entity46 crime statistics , @entity0 reported 331 murders in 2012 , ranking it among the most violent cities in the @entity2 the bureau released the results of its tests on the @entity64 after posting a series of videos on the tests to @entity68			1
the weapon was found to have the power to penetrate several inches of flesh as well as a human skull			0
' the bottom line is , the penetration results demonstrated that the @entity64 is a lethal weapon , ' @entity74 , chief of @entity53 's firearms technology branch told the @entity79			1
' the .380 bullets fired from the @entity64 penetrate sufficiently to reach vital organs and perforate the skull			1
' the @entity53 printed several versions of the gun using different materials			2
explosive : the liberator made from @entity88 exploded during testing the gun printed in a plastic material called @entity88 exploded during the test			1
but a gun rendered in a stronger plastic known as @entity95 shot eight rounds without any problems			2
' [ the testers ] quit after eight rounds , but there was no issue with the firearm at that point , ' @entity53 spokesperson @entity98 told @entity104			0
authorities say the guns are a particular concern because they 're made of plastic which is undetectable , meaning they could be brought into areas where weapons would normally be banned such as airports , schools and courts			2
depending on the metal detector , a bullet might not be enough to set it off , and the only way the gun itself could be detected would be with an x-ray machine , which are n't used in many facilities			2
the gun manages to bypass the @entity124 by including a metal block in its make - up			0
however , the metal part of the gun does n't play any part in its function and could be removed			0
undetectable : authorities are concerned that plastic @entity10 guns could be brought into places such as schools or government buildings where metal detectors would n't find them new threat : a liberator pistol next to the 3d printer on which its components were made			1
the single - shot handgun is the first firearm that can be made entirely with plastic components forged with a 3d printer the @entity124 of 1988 expires early next month , and there is a push to have the law updated to account for printed plastic guns			2
@entity152 congressman @entity151 told the @entity153 that he 's making a ' last - ditch effort ' to renew and update the law			0
' it would be unfathomable to me if we are not able to renew thiws law right now , ' he said			0
@entity53 spokesperson @entity98 outlined the bureau 's concerns to @entity104 : ' one , they do work			0
two , they ’re not reliable , and three , they ’re undetectable , ' says @entity98			0
' and that ’s a safety and security issue because they can make their way into secure facilities			0

comes 6 months after blueprints for world 's first printable gun went online
called @entity64 , it can be made on a printer costing less than $ 1,000
but official *experts* deemed it a safety risk after one exploded during tests
@entity0 is one of most violent cities in @entity2 with 331 murders last year
