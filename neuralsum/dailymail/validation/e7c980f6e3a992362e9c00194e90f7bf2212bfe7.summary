the @entity1 couple behind a mobile phone app which censors swear words from ebooks have removed all titles from their online catalogue following backlash from authors			1
clean reader replaces certain words that might be deemed r - rated with more friendly alternatives , but authors accused it of ' suppression ' and selling ' vandalised ' books			1
a statement from the firm this week said it was removing the titles after finding that ' many authors do not want their books being sold in connection with @entity10 '			1
after downloading the app , users are able to browse a variety of books , and when opened , can switch between ‘ clean ’ , ‘ cleaner ’ or ‘ squeaky clean ’ settings			1
the lowest setting only blocks ‘ major swear words , ’ according to @entity10 , which includes ‘ the f - word ’			1
@entity47 by @entity48 before : ‘ i do n’t want to f * * * you at all			0
my heart ’s as cold as cold potatoes just now			0
’ after : ‘ i do n’t want to [ freak ] you at all			0
my heart ’s as cold as cold potatoes just now			0
’ before : ‘ it was not woman ’s fault , nor even love ’s fault , nor the fault of sex			0
’ after : ‘ it was not woman ’s fault , nor even love ’s fault , nor the fault of [ love ]			0

’ gone girl by @entity76 before : ‘ the girl is one step ahead of me in everything , even sh * * * * luck			0
’ after : ‘ the girl is one step ahead of me in everything , even [ crappy ] luck			0
’ the ‘ cleaner ’ setting blocks slightly more words , while the highest setting ‘ is the most restrictive setting and will block the most profanity from a book including some hurtful racial terms			1
’ in the books , deleted words are covered up with a grey box , removing them from view			1
if users click a green dot in the middle of the box , the app will suggest alternative words that the can be used instead			2
a statement from @entity106 , published yesterday , reads : ' authors have expressed confusion on social media as they have not been consulted on their works ' inclusion in @entity10 's library , and there appears to be no easy way to opt - out			1
' we have also been notified that the algorithm used is imperfect , and that words chosen as replacements can often be unsuitable or even nonsensical			0
' chocolat author , @entity24 led the opposition to @entity10 , writing a blog post entitled : ' why i ’m saying “ f * * * you ” to @entity10 '			1
writing in a subsequent post after it was announced the titles were being removed from the app , she added : ' though i ’m delighted that @entity10 are no longer selling vandalized books , they are still distributing the app , and although this is certainly a victory for books , i would n’t start cheering just yet			1
' in the books , deleted words are covered up with a grey box , removing them from @entity140 users click a green dot in the middle of the box , the app will suggest alternative words that the can be used instead users can pick between ' clean ' , ' cleaner ' and ' squeaky clean '			1
the lowest setting blocks ' major ' swear words , and the highest blocks all profanity			0
alternatives for the deleted words are suggested when reading she added : ' if a reader chooses to avoid reading my books , that ’s fine			2
' if she hates it , that ’s also fine			0
if she has opinions on how it could have been done better , that ’s also fine , because she ’s entitled to her opinion , whether i agree or not			0
' but - her opinion does not extend to changing my work in any way			0
my book , my rules , and that includes my words			1
' novelist @entity170 tweeted : ' personally i think # @entity171 is a bunch of @entity173 and a bucket of @entity175 oh gosh they got to @entity176			0
' the @entity178 statement read : ' over the last several days we have been asking for and receiving significant feedback from authors			2
' a common theme in all of it is that many authors do not want their books being sold in connection with @entity10			1
' we have therefore taken immediate action to remove all books from our catalogue			2
' any books that have already been purchased will remain in users ' library and an app update will be released in the near future			2
the app works by scanning through a book and blocking out offensive words ( examples shown in these images ) shown left is an excerpt from @entity47 , where the word ' sex ' has been replaced by love			1
on the right is an excerpt from the same book , with this time ' penis ' replaced by ' groin ' the app works by scanning through a book and blocking out offensive words			1
the creators of @entity10 said : ‘ one day our oldest child came home from school and she was a little sad			2
‘ we asked her what was wrong and she said she had been reading a book during library time and it had a few swear words in it			2
‘ eventually we decided we would do all we could to bring @entity10 to the world			2
