a toddler who was born with no face is being given the chance to live a normal life thanks to the help of the same surgeon who separated @entity7 - born conjoined twins @entity8 and @entity9			1
three - year - old @entity10 was born with no eyes , a hole in the middle of his face where his nose should be and no upper jaw			1
the @entity18 born toddler , who lives in a small village six hours from @entity20 , was born deformed after complications in the womb stopped the bones in his face from fusing together			1
however socially , he is automatically an outcast as his appearance is considered too confronting for many			0
the toddler 's face is covered up whenever he leaves his small village and , due to lacking the roof of his mouth , he is unable to speak and can only communicate through grunts			2
@entity10 's plight first went global when the father of his closest friend took to @entity47 , pleading for medical professionals to help the boy lead a normal life			2
despite being happy , healthy and adored by his parents ( pictured ) the toddler 's face is covered whenever he leaves his town due to his appearance being too confronting for many ' i just want my child to look as normal as possible so he can go outside and play with the other kids , ' his father said from across the world , the post was read by @entity60 , a @entity61 breast cancer survivor who was born in a village close to @entity10 's			1
' he 's entered my heart ... i 'm so in love with this little boy , ' ms @entity60 told @entity66 's sunday night			0
' there was a big phone number in red [ on the post ] , it was quite obvious that it was a cry for help of some sort and i found myself reaching for the phone and calling the number			0
' he [ @entity10 's father ] said " i just want my child to look as normal as possible so he can go outside and play with the other kids "			0
' @entity60 , a @entity61 breast cancer survivor , heard of his story on @entity47 and took it upon herself to help @entity10 by flying him to @entity80 ' there was a big phone number in red , it was quite obvious that it was a cry for help of some sort and i found myself reaching for the phone and calling the number , ' ms @entity60 said of the message which was posted by @entity10 's neighbour ms @entity60 took it upon herself to search for a surgeon who would be willing to transform @entity10 's face and soon found @entity61 reconstructive surgeon , @entity94 who separated @entity7 - born conjoined twins @entity8 and @entity9			1
she then travelled to @entity10 's home where she met the toddler and his family for the first time before bringing them to @entity80			0

despite the serious risks involved , dr @entity94 soon agreed to operate on the toddler			2
' he may not die if we do n't operate on him , but he might if we do , ' dr @entity94 told @entity66 's sunday night			2
the operation will bring the two sides of @entity10 's skull together and shape him a nose from his own skin ' i believe that it ’s the right of everybody to look human and this kid does n't look human , ' dr @entity94 said ' i believe that it ’s the right of everybody to look human and this kid does n't look human			1
' @entity10 will undergo surgery in december , when dr @entity94 plans to bring the two sides of his skull together and build him a nose with his own skin			1
there is also a chance that the toddler will be able to speak after the procedure due to his vocal chords remaining intact			0
' we 're not experimenting on him , we want to get a good result , ' dr @entity94 said .			2
