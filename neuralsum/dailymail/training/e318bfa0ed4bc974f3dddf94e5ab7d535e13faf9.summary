@entity0 reveals he snubbed @entity1 for @entity2 last summer @entity3 are ramping up efforts to bring in @entity5 @entity7 boss says @entity8 was never on club 's radar by @entity11 published : 17:30 est , 3 january 2013 updated : 03:27 est , 4 january 2013 as time ticks on in the january transfer window , @entity0 offered a fascinating insight into modern - day recruitment methods on thursday			1
stressing that the job was tougher than when he arrived at @entity3 in september 1996 , he admitted that the pressure is always on ‘ to find the next @entity19 ’			2
@entity0 ’s exceptional record in the transfer market , especially in his early years as @entity3 ’s manager , is up there with the very best			1
@entity24 , @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity27 , @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity30 and @entity31 were among his finest acquisitions			0
one - off : do n't expect a @entity19 clone at @entity3 any time soon mastermind : @entity0 's scouting network uncovered the likes of @entity24 when they were winning trophies he was the supreme talent - spotter , well ahead of the rest in @entity41			1
@entity0 said : ‘ people want to see the next @entity19 - they do n’t want to see a promising guy			2
the name of the player gives people hope , but when they have n’t heard of them people are already sceptical			0
‘ it ’s much more difficult for us now			0
we are trying to diversify a bit more because we are limited in @entity41			0
a new market that is very interesting is @entity53 - it ’s very competitive			0
‘ the country where we were really competitive in the past was @entity56 , but they produce less top players than they did , say , 15 years ago			0
‘ the emerging countries look to be @entity60 and @entity61 - they have taken over from @entity56 and they have many good , young players			0
’ one of them , @entity5 , plays in @entity60 for @entity64 and @entity0 admitted on thursday that he is interested in signing him			1
on the radar : @entity66 international midfielder @entity5 @entity5 , 22 , has made it clear that he will not be signing a new contract at the @entity69 and will be leaving at the end of the season on a free transfer			1
@entity0 added : ‘ we have looked at him , yes , ’ but that is as far as he would be drawn on the @entity60 midfielder			2
he also admitted that @entity77 ’s latest recruit , @entity1 , was a target last summer , but he opted instead for @entity79 forward @entity2			1
@entity0 said : ‘ it was @entity2 or @entity1 in the summer — they are very similar players			1
i was a bit cautious about the noises on @entity1 ’s knee injury , but someone told me the problem he has is manageable and can be prevented			2
’ @entity0 has other targets in january , but @entity3 are being out - manoeuvred by @entity88 in the chase for @entity91 winger @entity90			1
in terms of trophy - winning potential , @entity3 can not compete with @entity88 and they are aware that @entity94 is right at the top of sir @entity97 ’s wishlist			2
second favourites : @entity3 are behind @entity88 in the running for @entity94 with @entity101 expected to sign a new contract with @entity3 in the coming weeks , it may be that @entity0 ’s interest in the @entity105 ’s best young player fades			1
instead he will turn to the continent again , reminding his scouts that the demand at @entity3 is to sign only the best talent			0
@entity0 conceded on thursday that although he was aware of @entity8 before he signed for @entity110 in the summer , he did n’t realise quite what a threat he would prove in the @entity112			1
over the @entity1 ; @entity0 declined the chance to sign the @entity115 striker last summer and instead chose @entity2 on sunday the @entity7 will come across him again when they travel to the @entity116 for their @entity118 third - round tie against @entity110			1
@entity0 added : ‘ honestly , @entity8 was not on our radar			1
you needed to have really deep knowledge of the market in @entity61 to do that			0
@entity125 did because he has the connections			0
‘ we keep our scouts alert , but when you are a big club like @entity3 your scouts are a little bit more cautious about players			2
‘ naturally they are less likely to look at players with smaller clubs			0
but what @entity8 is doing is not accidental			0
he is a really good player			0
