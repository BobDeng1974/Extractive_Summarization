you wo n’t find it written down anywhere in black and white yet it remains one of the unseen by - laws of the game : until such time as an almighty mess is sitting squarely on @entity9 ’s front step , the governing body chooses to keep the door bolted firmly shut			1
rows over goal - line technology were hardly something new when @entity15 ’s infamous ‘ ghost ’ goal against @entity16 in the @entity17 finally brought matters to a head			2
the @entity21 between @entity22 and @entity23 had already been scarred by a similar howler while the world watched agog five years later as a @entity27 effort which crossed the line at @entity29 was incredibly missed by all the officials despite keeper @entity31 ending up tangled in the rigging			2
@entity34 striker @entity33 has a goal - bound shot blocked by the outstretched arm of @entity38 such was the hullabaloo over the incident involving the @entity42 star that @entity9 did , in fact , begrudgingly make some noises about trialling goal - line systems but it was no more than platitudes to appease the masses			1
it took @entity15 ’s ruled - out effort in @entity51 – with the ball being clearly a yard over @entity55 ’s line in the last - 16 match – for the dam to finally burst			2
despite initially shrugging off calls for the adoption of goal - line technology to be approved , @entity9 relented two years later with the system fully operational last year in @entity62			1
the lesson for @entity65 football fans still bemused by events at @entity67 on sunday when the officials failed to spot a potentially game - changing handball ? perhaps only when such an outrage occurs in the @entity74 in @entity75 in three years ’ time will common sense prevail			1
for those who believe the @entity77 are intransigent to football embracing the kind of video technology that would have seen @entity38 red carded and @entity34 awarded a penalty in the @entity83 semi-final , here ’s some news … in february , the @entity87 – the @entity77 , @entity88 , @entity89 , @entity90 and @entity9 – gathered in @entity91 supposedly to discuss the possibility of approving trials			1
before the meeting , @entity88 representative @entity94 made no bones about his association ’s stance			0
@entity33 heads the ball , which is deflected clearly off the hand of @entity101 ' @entity38 ( left ) on sunday ‘ we ca n’t live in the past , ’ he stated			1
‘ @entity103 the ( @entity88 chairman ) has come out and said he embraces it , and i think in certain circumstances i would look at it			0
we ’ve got to move forward			0
the game is getting much quicker			2
‘ the tv coverage , you know , 28 , 30 cameras a game			2
everything is replayed , replayed			0
so how do we use that ? my personal view is yes , sensibly , but it needs to be done in a manner that does n’t detract from the fast - paced , quick action of football			2
’ despite cases also being forwarded by the @entity77 and @entity120 @entity88 to at least take the matter further , @entity9 , aided by a sceptical @entity90 representative , simply kicked the matter into the long grass			1
it wo n’t be discussed again for at least another year now with the inevitable injustices far enough off the radar in the interim			0
‘ it ’s a question of making the biggest decision ever in the way football is played , ’ said @entity9 ’s secretary general @entity129 by way of an explanation for its rejection afterwards			1
while that may well be the case , procrastinating on the issue is hardly likely to resolve it			0
injustices like those that almost certainly cost @entity34 a place in the @entity144 on sunday are hardly a rarity in the global game			1
@entity34 captain @entity147 ( left ) has words with referee @entity149 during the @entity83 semi-final yet , until such time as one directly affects the outcome of a @entity74 match involving one of the game ’s heavyweights , they seem set to remain an ugly , unsatisfying feature of the landscape			1
to the great embarrassment of @entity160 , the stationing of additional officials behind both goals has proved to be an extraordinary waste of time			1
seemingly less reluctant to get involved than traditional linesman , ‘ additional assistant referees ’ - to give them their sunday names - have seemed utterly superfluous since they were first trialled in the 2009 - 10 @entity167			1
on sunday , @entity173 , the official behind the goal , should have had a clear view of @entity38 ’ handball			1
but for reasons best known to himself , he failed to advise referee @entity149 on what seemed an inevitable course of action			0
it took the high - profile blunder that denied @entity15 in 2010 to shift @entity9 on goal - line tecnhology ‘ i knew it was a penalty , ’ said @entity34 striker @entity33			1
‘ i think everyone in the ground knew it was a penalty			0
i asked the ref why he did n’t give the penalty and he said the assistant behind the goal said it hit him ( @entity38 ) on the face			1
’ there is absolutely no excusing such crass incompetence			0
@entity149 and @entity173 should both have seen the handball with their own eyes and , even if one may have blinked at the wrong moment , assuredly one of them should have ensured the right call was made			0
that they did n’t is another blight on what ’s been a desperate season for officiating in this country			0
perhaps more than ever , the @entity77 now has good reason to press @entity9 to at least road - test video technology			1
it ’s hardly unchartered territory in sport			0
for those who prefer the oval ball game , a @entity216 has been part of the fabric of rugby for 14 years now			2
no - one claims the system is perfect – decisions can often take longer to reach than they should - but few would dispute that it has n’t enhanced the game because the right outcome is eventually arrived at			1
@entity15 's disallowed goal forced @entity9 to rethink , and @entity65 fans must hope for a similar incident used only in first - class and international televised games , the @entity216 can only rule on exactly what the referee asks him			1
this usually involves , in try - scoring situations , whether a player ’s foot has been in touch or to see if the ball has been properly grounded , but the @entity216 is also used to review if there has been dangerous or foul play			2
while the video review is normally conclusive , the snag – which is clearly a red flag for @entity9 – is the time delay			1
at a recent @entity246 match between @entity247 and @entity248 , it took four minutes of review to award the winning try to the former while two other tries were disallowed			0
@entity252 , the @entity248 chief executive , later labelled the @entity216 process ‘ a shambles ’			0
‘ it ’s almost make it up as you go along , ’ @entity33 said			1
indeed , rugby ’s growing concern over the effect the @entity216 is having on the sport has led to @entity261 , the ball - tracking technology company , to hold talks with the @entity263 about providing a replacement to the current system			0
@entity266 's @entity216 may not be perfect , but it has shown that the game is better for use of technology @entity261 , which is already used in cricket , tennis and for goal - line decisions in football , says it can provide information for decisions within a few seconds by synchronising cameras from multiple angles			2
@entity278 , the founder of @entity261 , said : ‘ our system is a much cleverer way of looking at incidents			0
in @entity283 , we have halved the average time for decisions to be made			0
’ it can be assumed that , were @entity9 to give tacit approval to video technology , @entity261 would have just the programme to fit the bill			2
using it sparingly would maintain the rhythm of football whilst ensuring that the 17 @entity292 are correctly applied			0
for football , the answers are already out there			0
if only someone would first ask the questions .			0

@entity34 were denied place in @entity83 final by shocking decision
@entity33 ' header was blocked by @entity38 ' hand
none of the officials managed to spot the game - changing decision
additional officials behind goals has proved an extraordinary waste of time
but @entity9 will require a higher profile blunder to change their laws
