it was the culmination of a series of risky spacewalks where little had gone according to plan			0
but after being forced to improvise a toothbrush into a bolt cleaning device to remove a broken power supply unit in a previous spacewalk , @entity5 astronaut @entity4 could not hide her delight as full power was finally restored to the @entity12			1
the @entity14 flight engineer , appeared to touch the bright sun during the mission ’s third spacewalk on sept. 5 , 2012 in the amazing new images released today by the space agency			2
they also installed a camera on the @entity12 ’s robotic arm , @entity40			1
earlier in the spacewalk , the two astronauts resorted to macgyver like moves to save the $ 100 billion @entity12 with a $ 3 toothbrush			1
astronauts @entity4 and @entity44 were able to construct a makeshift tool saving the day : the toothbrush was used to repair the @entity12 their ingenuity allowed for the installation of a much needed part on the space station , needed to relay power			1
trouble on the spacecraft started last week , when @entity4 and @entity54 were trying to replace a malfunctioning electrical unit , called a main bus switching unit ( @entity33 ) , on the space station			2
there are four 220 - pound @entity59 on the @entity12 that are able to harness power from the outpost 's solar arrays			1
but with one of the electrical units not operating , there had been limited power use in the space station and astronauts were called on to replace it with a new one			2
@entity4 and @entity27 had been working to install a new @entity33 back on august 30 but encountered difficulty in bolting the new unit down to the spacecraft			2
it appeared that there was significant debris , described as metal shavings , that had amassed inside the bolts and was preventing them from attaching it to the space craft and securing the @entity33			0
@entity27 was able to maneuver a wire cleaner around one of the bolt holders , that loosed a lot of metal shavings but it just was n't enough , he told the @entity5 team back in @entity91			2
space walk : @entity5 astronaut @entity4 and @entity94 astronaut @entity27 at the @entity12 their repeated attempts to clean out the bolts drew out their space walk to a daunting 8 hours			1
' over 10 hours in the suit			0
no bathroom and no lunch , ' @entity4 wrote in her blog about the grueling ordeal , about the total time she was suited up for space			0
with the debris around the bolts , there was little chance of a successful @entity33 installation			0
so the space team , along with their colleagues at @entity5 back on earth put their heads together to figure out a way to fix the problem			0
they decided the outer space team needed to do some deep cleaning and the idea for the toothbrush tool was born - fastening a simple toothbrush to a metal pole			0
cleaning house : the astronauts prepared for cleaning the @entity12 ( @entity12 ) on september 5 , with their toothbrush mission possible : @entity4 and @entity27 perform a spacewalk to complete an equipment installation outside the @entity12 on wednesday , @entity4 and @entity27 took to cleaning the bolts			1
after about four hours of intense scrubbing , the bolts were pristine and the pair were able to successfully attach the @entity33			0
' looks like you guys just fixed the station , ' astronaut @entity135 radioed from @entity139 at @entity5 's @entity140 in @entity91 , @entity141			0
the @entity12 is currently home to six astronauts : @entity4 and @entity143 of @entity5 , @entity54 of the @entity28 , and @entity145 cosmonauts @entity146 , @entity147 and @entity148 .			1

spacewalk installed *critical* power unit that threatened to cripple the @entity12 's ability to carry out *experiments*
astronauts had previously been forced to adapt a toothbrush to clean a stuck bolt holding the broken unit in place
