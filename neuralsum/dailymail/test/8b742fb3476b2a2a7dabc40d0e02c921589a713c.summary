a young man who has been stuck in the foster system since the day his mother gave birth to him behind bars has finally found a home			0
@entity6 only , 16 , became the face of adoption and an example of all the struggles faced by many teenagers in the system when in 2013 he stood up in a suit and told worshipers at @entity17 's @entity16 ; ' my name is @entity6 and i 've been in foster care since i was born			1
i know @entity21 has n't given up on me , so i 'm not giving up either			0
' he then said ; ' i 'll take anyone			0
old or young , dad or mom , black , white , purple			0
and i would be really appreciative			0
the best i could be			0
' most of all , @entity6 said he just wanted a family that would ' love him forever			1
' millions of people around the country soon head about @entity6 's story , and the young boy was even interviewed by @entity34 on @entity35 , which all eventually led to him being adopted by a minister in @entity37 and his family			1
that is until @entity6 got into a fight with one of the other children , and the minister sent him back to @entity17 , and back to live in the foster care system			1
in an interview with the @entity64 she revealed that after @entity6 returned , people kept asking her what it was that went wrong and caused him to be sent back after just three months			2
she said wanted to tell these people ; ' that boy spent his whole life in the system , that 's what went wrong			0
' making matters worse , @entity6 and miss @entity45 , as he calls her , did not speak when he came back to @entity17			1
@entity6 had cut himself off from other people , playing video games as he quickly went through four different homes and four schools in less than year			2
going says she had begun to call him numerous times , but always hung up the phone			0
then , one night last july , @entity6 called up miss @entity45 and asked her the question he had been asking since they first met when he was only a little boy			1
' do you remember what i asked you before ? ' he said			0
' well , how do you feel about adopting me now ? ' for the first time since he had asked , going was finally able to give him the answer he wanted to hear			0
the 52 - year - old had three children of her own , one adopted and two biological daughters , and was a single mother , but she was no longer @entity6 's case worker , which made the process easier			1
from august through december he started spending more and more time with the family , a perfect fit as he was already close to going 's adopted son @entity97			2
then , in december , going got a lawyer and began the process of adopting @entity6			2
@entity6 ( above ) called and asked miss @entity45 if she would adopt him last july ' i guess i always thought of you as my mom , ' @entity6 ( above in 2013 ) said to going last december @entity6 got his first bedroom , his first set of siblings , and , most importantly , the one thing he had been hoping for all along			1
' i guess i always thought of you as my mom , ' @entity6 said to going last december			1
' only now i get to call you that for real , right ? ' going is set to officially become @entity6 's mother on april 22 , and she will admit it has not been an easy task			1
there is fighting and tables get flipped , but in the end everyone loves one another , and she is prepared for the challenges			0
@entity6 officially became part of the family in february however , when after he and going celebrated their birthdays , which fall on the same date , they went home and sat around the table for cake with his three siblings and signed the court papers			1
after 16 years @entity6 was finally home			0
what 's more , because of that day in september 2013 when @entity6 stepped up on the pulpit , hundreds of others have been adopted as well .			2

@entity6 only , 16 , captured hearts around the nation in 2013 when he made a plea in front of church congregation for a family to ' love him forever '
he was adopted by a minister in @entity37 but sent back into the system a few months later when he fought with one of the minister 's children
in the next year he was *shuttled* between four different homes and four schools in @entity17 before calling his old *caseworker* , @entity45 going
@entity6 called and asked miss @entity45 if she would adopt him last july
going agreed , and in february they signed court papers to officially make @entity6 her son , which should take effect april 22
' i guess i always thought of you as my mom , ' @entity6 said to going last december
