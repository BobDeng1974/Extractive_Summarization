@entity12 , 63 , a former tennis coach turned property developer , led an ' international lifestyle ' , including yachting and playing polo with royalty , off the back of an off - shore family trust worth at least £ 30m , according to his ex-wife , @entity21			1
but he claimed he was broke , having declared himself bankrupt in the @entity22 when he and his wife split in 2000			0
battle : @entity12 ( left ) , was described as a ' polo playing friend of prince @entity4 ' worth £ 30m , is facing a bid to have him jailed by his ex-wife @entity21 ( right ) , for not handing over @entity27 and @entity29 cars and a @entity8 as well as a personalised number plate as part of his divorce settlement however , his plea of poverty was rejected by divorce judge , mr @entity36 , who ordered him to pay his ex £ 368,000 including costs			1
in june last year , the judge also ruled that mrs @entity21 could enforce her order against two riverside flats in @entity42 - valued by lawyers at £ 1m - along with two @entity6 cars and a @entity8 , as they represented the only accessible assets linked to her husband in the @entity22			0
the properties and the vehicles were the property of mr @entity12 ’s off - shore family trust , but the judge allowed the wife to ' pierce the corporate veil ' and take possession in order to satisfy the divorce award			1
now mrs @entity21 has applied to the @entity58 to have mr @entity12 committed to prison , for his alleged failure to deliver up the @entity27 and @entity29 cars and the motorbike , along with personalised number plate @entity63			1
mr @entity12 has already had an appeal against the lump sum order thrown out by @entity67 , in the @entity68 - where he was described by the judge as ' generally angry about everything			1
' the businessman , of @entity72 , @entity42 , and mrs @entity21 , separated in 2000 , after a 17 - year marriage , leaving her as the primary carer for their teenage daughter			0
in 2011 , mr @entity36 called mr @entity12 ’s conduct of the case ' truly abysmal '			1
he also found that ' bankruptcy in the @entity22 did n’t involve much hardship for the husband			0
' ' his business was successful and was owned by the ( off - shore ) trust , ' said the judge , who added : ' he had access to large amounts of cash from his inheritance in the @entity90			0
' ' @entity91 ' : mrs @entity21 ' then barrister , @entity92 , told the @entity68 last year ' he is the polo - playing friend of prince @entity4 and the beneficiary of an off - shore trust with assets exceeding £ 30m ' he put mr @entity12 ’s identifiable assets at £ 1m , although his wife claims he has access to far more			1
mrs @entity21 , formerly of @entity99 , @entity100 , but currently believed to be living in @entity42 , is now asking the @entity101 to commit her ex-husband to prison for alleged contempt of court in failing to hand over the cars and motorbike awarded to her by the judge			1
in a preliminary hearing , her barrister , @entity108 , told the court that ' 19 attempts ' had so far been made to serve court documents on mr @entity12 , without success , and asked mrs justice @entity114 to deem that he had been officially informed of the proceedings via email last month			1
@entity117 , for mr @entity12 , did not object , and the judge ruled that good service had been achieved and ordered mr @entity12 to pay legal costs			1
however mr @entity117 went on to tell the court that mr @entity12 argues it is not his responsibility to hand over the vehicles and number plate			2
the most valuable of the cars is in the @entity90 and , according to the husband , belonged to a former tennis player whom he used to coach , the barrister said			2
' ( @entity129 ) has been transferred to the wife , so in our submission , it is up to her to retrieve it , ' he told the judge			0
miss @entity108 said that the tennis player - @entity136 , a former @entity137 doubles finalist - had told mrs @entity21 , " we ’ve got the car - come and get it in the @entity90 if you want to try your hand , " - that is his position			0
' international lifestyle : @entity12 , 63 , a former tennis coach turned property developer , led an ' international lifestyle ' , including yachting and playing polo with royalty , off the back of an off - shore family trust worth at least £ 30m , according to his ex-wife , @entity154			1
pictured is prince @entity156 taking part in a charity polo match arguing that it is mr @entity12 ’s responsibility to track down and deliver up the vehicles to his ex , the barrister added : ' it is for him and his company to take proceedings in the @entity90			2
' mrs @entity21 ’ then barrister , @entity92 , told the @entity68 last year that mr @entity12 ' is a man of contradiction			2
' ' to the court , in these proceedings , he is penniless and staving off the insolvency of the company that has been his life ’s work			0
' to the public at large he is the polo - playing friend of prince @entity4 and the beneficiary of an off - shore trust with assets exceeding £ 30m , including properties in @entity179 , @entity180 , @entity181 and @entity182			0
' the barrister also claimed that ' post-separation , the husband had continued to live life as before , funded via the trust			0
' he added : ' by contrast , the wife ... was not funded by the trust and was left penniless ... mr @entity12 continued to lead an international lifestyle , developing properties and spending much of his time sailing			1
all of this was conducted behind the veil of the trust			0
' the full committal hearing , which could see mr @entity12 put behind bars if he does not hand over the vehicles and the number plate , is now set to come back before the @entity58 in the @entity202			2
mr @entity12 also has another challenge pending in the @entity68 , which will be heard first			2
outside court , the husband ’s barrister estimated the value of the two properties at about £ 1m , though the equity in them is believed to be less than £ 100,000			0
