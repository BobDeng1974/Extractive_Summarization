@entity0 says that @entity4 are strong at chasing down league leaders as they did last season @entity0 takes instructions from manager @entity21 as @entity4 drew 2 - 2 with @entity27 on sunday heading into 2015 , @entity4 have reduced the gap between themselves and @entity1 from eight to three points			1
‘ we know that we are good at being second and chasing someone , ’ @entity0 said			1
‘ we ’ve done it before			2
we know how to deal with every situation and we are ready for it			0
’ the in - form @entity34 maintains that @entity4 have learned the lessons of their meek title defence during the 2012 - 13 campaign , when they surrendered their @entity9 crown with barely a whimper to @entity18			1
@entity4 threw away a two - goal lead and missed the chance to close the gap on @entity1 to one point ‘ yes , we all know what happened and it ’s an example for us , ’ @entity0 added , ‘ we learn from our mistakes			1

’ it is a statement that may sound rather hollow after @entity4 relinquished a 2 - 0 lead to draw 2 - 2 against @entity27 on sunday afternoon			1

@entity65 ( above ) made it 2 - 1 before @entity66 equalised ‘ yes , but it ’s not an excuse that we were tired			2

both teams did n’t have many changes			0
sometimes it ’s like this and you have to accept it			0
they played well - a draw was fair			2
’ @entity4 take on @entity78 on @entity79 at the @entity80 and may have to do without @entity81 and @entity82 , who continue to nurse calf and groin problems respectively			2
there is , however , some better news on the injury front , with @entity87 hoping to return ahead of schedule			0
it had initially been feared that the @entity91 frontman would be out until the second half of january after pulling a calf muscle in the warm - up at @entity95 earlier this month			2
