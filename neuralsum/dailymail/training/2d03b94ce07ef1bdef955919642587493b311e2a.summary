@entity11 is n't exactly brimming with @entity13 's light in footage from an upcoming 20/20 interview			1
the 67 - year - old 's skin is flushed and his eyes red as he admits to @entity19 , ' i had put that stuff behind me ... i did n’t want to have to deal with these things publicly			1
' but public they 've certainly become and @entity11 finally admitted to his sexual misdeeds in @entity26 magazine wednesday before sitting down for the @entity19 interview			1
confessional : admitted pedophile @entity11 taped an interview for 20/20 after penning a lengthy confession to people about the girls he touched or exposed himself to up until 1994 interview : @entity11 of @entity3 fame will appear on 20/20 in an interview with @entity19 in which he confesses to his sex crimes but says he 's a changed man who has n't touched an underage girl since 1994 ' i had dealt with them very , very strongly , and committedly , in my private life , but i think , i ’m a human being with flaws and i ’ve done everything to address it , ' he tells @entity19 in the interview to air friday			1
one way he claims to have addressed his problem is through faith			0
' one of the main things about the @entity52 faith , is you know , @entity48 said in so many ways , " bring me that … which about you is broken , bring it , " and most people are broken in some way , ' he says			0
in @entity60 ' lengthy confessional essay for @entity26 , he admits he inappropriately touched one girl and exposed himself to two others between 1973 and 1994 , and that his actions were ' inexcusable ' and have ' haunted ' him ever since			2
while none of his victims have ever publicly come forward , and the 67 - year - old never charged , reports of his misbehavior surfaced in october when his soon - to - be ex-wife @entity69 released a taped confession which was obtained by @entity71 in the midst of their bitter divorce			1
in the public backlash to the @entity71 tapes , @entity11 lost parts on tv show scandal and in the sequel to the movie @entity81 , while re-runs of @entity3 were pulled from the air			1
' forty years ago , i did something terribly wrong that i deeply regret			0
i have been working to atone for it ever since , ' @entity11 wrote in people			1

scandal : @entity11 is best known for playing reverend @entity90 on long - running family drama @entity3 ( left )			1
reports about his indiscretions first came to light in october when his estranged wife @entity69 ( pictured together on the right ) released a taped confession which was obtained @entity71 ' on the recording , i described events that took place 20 , 32 , and 40 years ago , ' @entity11 adds			1
' the publication of the recording has resulted in assumptions and innuendos about what i did that go far beyond what actually occurred			0
as difficult as this is , i want people to know the truth			0
' he says the only time he touched a girl inappropriately was in 1973 , when he was 25 and a pre-teen girl came to stay with him and his first wife			0
@entity11 says he exposed himself to the girl twice before , but took things to another level on the visit			1
' when the girl and i were watching tv alone , i moved her hand in such a way that caused her to touch me inappropriately			0
it lasted less than a minute , during which there was no gratification , ' @entity11 said			1
' i then left the room			0
i had no further physical contact with her			0
it was a completely impulsive act and it 's haunted me ever since to think of what i put her through			0
' over the next two decades , @entity11 says he continued to expose himself to two more teenage girls , once in 1982 and again in 1994			2
' the first instance lasted second and the second about a minute , ' @entity11 says of the indecent exposure			1
' i had no physical contact of any kind with either girl			0
i do n't say this to excuse what i did - it was inexcusable - but to clarify what actually happened			0
' @entity11 says the exposure in 1994 was his ' rock bottom ' and what caused him to finally seek help for his deviant behavior			1
for the past twenty years , @entity11 says he 's undergoing therapy and religious counseling , while praying and meditating every day			1
family values : @entity3 was a show about a pastor and his wife , raising their large brood of seven children			0
a young @entity158 ( to @entity11 ' right in a blue sweater ) played the couple 's oldest daughter			2
@entity11 says he never behaved inappropriately toward any of the young actresses on the show 's set these treatments , @entity11 claims , have worked and kept him from harming other young girls			2
' since that day in 1994 , i have not had an impulse to act out in any such way			0
' @entity11 has only apologized directly to one of his victims , who he says was ' extraordinary gracious ' , but has not reached out to the others for fear that he will be ' opening old wounds '			2
the actor also describes how the recorded confession came to be			2
he says he and his wife @entity178 were undergoing marriage therapy sessions in hopes of healing their relationship			1
the second follow - up session is when @entity11 says he and the therapist were taped by his wife without either of their knowledge			1
the couple of nearly thirty years , filed for divorce in 2012 but have been engaged in a heated legal battle over how to split their assets			0
@entity178 , who is also an actress , is fighting for high spousal support payments of $ 13,000 a month , saying she is no longer able to make a living from her career when she took a break to raise their daughter			0
she also says she only released the taped confession to police , when @entity11 allegedly denied to seek treatment for his issues			1
she denies ever turning the audio over to @entity71			0
@entity11 says the release of the tapes in october led to confusion over when he exposed himself to the young girls , and if it was possible one of his young co-stars on @entity3 was a victim			1
' i appeared for eleven seasons on a television series with a cast that included minor females in our tv family , and countless other young actresses throughout the show 's eleven years			0
i never behaved inappropriately on or off that set - or on any set i 've ever worked on			0
' when the tapes were first released , law enforcement in @entity220 and @entity221 said they were investigating the claims			2
