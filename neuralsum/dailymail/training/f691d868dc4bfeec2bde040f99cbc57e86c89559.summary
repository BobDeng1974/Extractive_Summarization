by @entity0 published : 07:34 est , 11 june 2013 updated : 12:54 est , 11 june 2013 if you 're sick of walking around with an embarrassing gape in the front of your blouse , then @entity1 could have the answer			0
the high street favourite has developed a ' @entity9 ' shirt , which uses a hidden placket - a finished opening that allows for movement - and concealed extra buttons to banish gaping for good			1
although the innovation is currently limited to a couple of shirts in the autograph range , from august , all shirts sold by the brand will include the ' @entity9 ' placket			1
no more embarrassment : @entity1 's new ' no peep ' shirts have hidden buttons and an extra placket ' in the past , feedback sessions have found that many of our customers have had issues with their shirt buttons gaping open to reveal their undergarments , ' said @entity34 's @entity33 , @entity35			1
' in response to this we have developed the @entity39 shirt			0
it ’s ideal for women with a bigger bust but also helps provide a cleaner line for all shapes			0
' they have been so popular since the launch in march that we will be incorporating this technology into all @entity34 shirts with a placket by the end of july			2
' no peep technology is n't the only design innovation made by the high street retailer in recent months			0
last week , the retailer announced the launch of the ' @entity57 ' dress , which uses a supportive lining to create the illusion of a slimmer physique			1
new talent : former @entity63 ceo @entity62 has been hired to reinvigorate @entity34 womenswear according to @entity34 , the slimming dresses give a more defined waist and a smoother silhouette thanks to the lining , which is made from fabric used in the retailer 's shapewear line			2
@entity1 has had a rough ride in recent years with commentators and customers deriding collections as dowdy and unflattering			0
that however could all be about to change thanks to the introduction of useful innovations such as the no peep shirt and the appointment of @entity63 's former ceo @entity62 as the retailer 's new style director			1
' i want women to be proud of a garment when they take it off and hang it on the back of a chair , ’ @entity85 , who is also behind the no peep innovation told @entity95 columnist , @entity94			0
@entity85 , who says she is most proud of the brand 's £ 25 no peep white shirts , added : ' buttons are concealed so it stops you gaping , which is great if you have a big bust			2

@entity106 has extra placket ( opening allowing movement ) and concealed buttons
