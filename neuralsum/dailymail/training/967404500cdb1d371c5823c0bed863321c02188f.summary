the @entity1 in 2022 could be played safely between may 5 and june 4 rather than in the winter , the @entity0 has argued			2
football 's world governing body @entity3 announced last month that the most likely time slots for the tournament would be either january / february or november / december 2022 , with the organisation 's medical chief warning that temperatures in the @entity12 state between may and september posed a ' highly critical risk '			1
however , the @entity0 , in conjunction with the @entity15 ( @entity16 ) , has put together a proposal which it feels demonstrates how the tournament could be played in may and june without putting the health of players , supporters and officials at risk			1
@entity3 president @entity24 pictured announcing that @entity1 will be hosting the @entity1 @entity1 could be played between may 5 and june 4 rather than in winter , argue @entity0 the organisations also argue that their proposal would have the least impact on the 2021 - 22 or 2022 - 23 club calendars , which would need to be seriously revised if either of the options favoured by @entity3 is ratified			1
a section of the proposal from the @entity0 and @entity16 reads : ' the may option is the best alternative to the traditional june - july timing , since it retains the logical calendar order and avoids compressing such an important competition as the @entity1 in the middle of the traditional and busy club football season ( winter season )			1
' as such , simply avoiding this concentration makes the may option by far less intrusive compared to all winter proposals			0
' the @entity0 and @entity16 propose matches in the group stages - which under their plans would run from may 5 to 19 , 2022 - would be played between 6pm and 11pm local time			1
knockout matches , starting from may 21 , would kick off at either 7pm or 10pm local time			0
under the wet - bulb globe temperature ( @entity52 ) reading , a measure used to determine the level of risk caused by exposure to certain climatic conditions , they argue only games kicking off at 6pm or 7pm could be classified as ' high risk ' , with other games under the @entity52 measurement deemed ' moderate risk '			0
an artist 's illustration provided by @entity1 of the 45,330 capacity @entity66 stadium the organisations argue their proposal would have the least impact on the 2021 - 22 or 2022 - 23 club calendars they cite two games played at last summer 's @entity1 in @entity75 - @entity74 vs @entity76 in @entity77 and the @entity78 vs @entity76 clash in @entity80 , as posing the same high risk , and also report that on - field temperatures at the 1994 @entity1 final between @entity84 and @entity75 in @entity85 reached 48 degrees @entity86 , far higher than any they anticipate being encountered at those kick - off times in @entity1 , based on past data			1
the proposal document continued : ' the may 2022 option provides acceptable climatic conditions with regard to both players and fans			0
in may the average temperature in @entity1 as of 6pm local time is between 30 to 35 degrees @entity86 ( source : @entity99 ) and the @entity101 index would be ' green ' ( moderate ) for most @entity1 games			0
' in worst case , games would be played in circumstances similar to some cities in @entity75 during the @entity107 ( @entity108 , @entity80 ) and still better than some games played at the @entity110 in @entity111 ( 1986 ) and the @entity78 ( 1994 )			0
@entity3 announced last month the likely time slots would be january / february or november / december 2022 ' moreover , with the support of the cooling systems that the @entity115 committed to , temperature in the stadiums would be perfect			1
' @entity3 's chief medical officer @entity118 made a presentation to the @entity3 task force considering dates for the tournament last month			2
he said at that time : ' what i have said is that for the players , the accompanying staff and the fans the months june till august are highly critical in terms of risk , due to the climatic conditions in @entity1			2
' in may and september it is borderline when it comes to the temperature of high risk but from the medical point of view it is not recommended			0
' the months from october until march are actually optimal in terms of the temperature			0
' the @entity0 and @entity16 will present their proposal at the next task force meeting early next year , on a date yet to be confirmed .			2

the @entity0 have put together a proposal for the tournament to be played in may and june without putting health of players , fans and officials at risk
@entity3 announced last month january / february or november / december 2022 were most likely time slots for tournament to be played
@entity0 are proposing their new dates in conjunction with @entity15 ( @entity16 )
they argue it would have least impact on 2021 - 22 or 2022 - 23 club calendars
