by @entity0 @entity1 is breathing a sigh of relief after doctors told him they believe his @entity6 scare is actually just malaria the @entity9 man who was quarantined in @entity10 and suspected to have been infected with @entity6 probably just has malaria			1
humanitarian worker @entity1 , 27 , had just returned from a four - month stint in @entity13 , where he was doing farming and building work , when he started developing symptoms similar to those shown by @entity6 victims			1
when mr @entity1 initially tested negative for malaria he became terrified that he may have the killer disease , but now it turns out that he probably does have malaria after all			2
mr @entity1 returned to @entity10 on july 17 for his mother 's birthday , and developed severe stomach pains and high fever two weeks later			1
to go with the diarrhoea , sore throat and headaches , he was quarantined in @entity31 's @entity30 and had to deal with the fearful prospect that he may be the latest victim of the untreatable disease			2
he was kept in an isolated glass box for more than 72 hours , as @entity35 all over the country feared the disease had spread to their shores , but an infectious disease doctor has now told him that all the evidence suggests he has malaria - a disease he had already contracted back in february			0
' i 've been taking a lot of medicine , and so that kind of might have interfered , and so they could n't spot any malaria in my blood work , but it could still be there , ' @entity1 told @entity49			2
they thought i was joking			0
' mr @entity1 plans to return to @entity13 to continue his humanitarian work he recounted how he first fell ill : ' i turned up the heat in the car to 90 degrees and drove back to @entity9 — then i got out of the car and i was freezing again			1
' my mother took my temperature and it was 104			0
when she called our family doctor , she said to get me to the emergency room at @entity30			0
' @entity1 's nurse , @entity68 , compared the next 72 hours to the night the hospital went on overdrive to house extra patients forced to evacuate another hospital during @entity73			0
' if he had the ebola virus , we all knew how it could impact so many people ’s lives , ' she said			0
now that he has been given the all - clear , mr @entity1 plans to return to @entity13 to continue his humanitarian work once the @entity6 outbreak has cleared up			1
the virus claimed its first @entity83 victim on monday , when 75 - year - old @entity85 priest @entity84 died five days after being airlifted from @entity86 to @entity87 for expert care			1
the overall death toll is now at 1,069 people , and with it continuing to rise with no signs of stopping , the @entity91 declared it ethical to use untested drugs to attempt to control it .			0
