here 's your guide to working out just how much you hate @entity2 : if you think @entity3 should have stayed on his feet and let a reckless 6ft 4in , 17 - stone goalkeeper shatter his ankle with his wild two - footed lunge then you really do hate @entity2			1
if you 're re-writing the offside law claiming @entity11 's goal should n't have stood , you hate @entity2			1
@entity3 touched the ball past @entity14 goalkeeper @entity13 during the @entity16 clash @entity3 went down a moment after and several of the @entity14 players were unhappy with his actions @entity3 lies down on the ground before the penalty is given by the referee late on at @entity23 @entity3 scored from the spot to put @entity2 3 - 1 up against @entity14 @entity25 are shovelling money into @entity28 's bank account for nothing if @entity31 were as good as their fans would have us believe , the @entity30 would be top and favourites for the @entity35 @entity36 requires a superhuman effort to restore past glories to @entity39 @entity40 are on the verge but @entity43 's lack of empathy for fans holds them back if you think @entity47 has fouled his marker before he slams home the second then you hate @entity2			1
if you were desperate for @entity14 to hold on to their lead and felt immense disappointment bordering on physical pain when @entity11 , @entity47 and then @entity3 scored their goals then you hate @entity2			1
if you are focusing on @entity2 not playing fluent football , and completely ignoring the fact that they have lost one game in 19 , almost as if you 're trying to convince yourself that run is n't true , then you hate @entity2			0
if your focus is on @entity60 not playing well then you 're borderline obsessed with him , and you hate @entity2			0
@entity11 has his shot while @entity3 ( left ) stands in an offside position but does not touch the ball @entity11 runs away in celebration as the referee lets the goal stand while @entity14 remain unhappy @entity11 scored to make it 1 - 1 as @entity2 went on to win the @entity16 tie and avoid an upset if you 're desperately trying to manufacture more statistics and evidence that show just how much better @entity2 were under @entity72 than they are now under @entity73 , then you 've got too much time on your hands , and you hate @entity2			1
if the success of your season is based on them going out of the @entity16 and dropping out of the top four rather than anything your own club might do , then you have an irrational hatred of @entity2			1
if you 've suddenly adopted a philosophy this season that winning a cup tie is n't as important as playing brilliant football during that tie , then you hate @entity2			2
if you are focusing on @entity2 's negatives after @entity89 's side made it through yet another away tie then you must be wondering how on earth your team is below @entity2 in the @entity95 table			1
@entity47 smashes home his goal to make it 2 - 1 to @entity2 en route to their victory @entity47 scores to give @entity2 the lead as they turn the game on its head at @entity23 @entity47 celebrates as @entity2 progressed through the @entity16 tie to the quarter - finals despite an earlier scare @entity47 and @entity107 celebrate as @entity2 take the lead in the @entity16 tie if you keep saying @entity2 are terrible then you are trying to convince yourself they are terrible			1
which is a bit weird			0
they 're not great , but they 're not terrible			0
this also means you hate @entity2			0
if you 've experienced untold voyeuristic joy since sir @entity113 left and @entity2 fell a third of the way down the table , then you hate @entity2			0
if you are hammering home ( to anyone who ca n't get away from you quick enough ) a point about how much money @entity2 have spent , thinking that football is played on a computer screen and not on grass , then you hate @entity2			0
when a club is as successful as @entity2 have been it 's understandable that jealousy kicks in among supporters of lesser clubs , and that transforms itself into hatred			2
@entity2 manager @entity73 pictured at @entity23 as his side beat @entity14 to make the quarter - finals i do n't know how @entity2 's season will finish , but my opinion is that if they end up outside the top four – even if they improve on last season 's seventh place – then @entity89 has failed			1
if they win the @entity16 it 's a bonus , but @entity2 's season is n't about that			1
it 's about getting back into the @entity35			2
@entity2 want to win the @entity16 of course , but the bigger clubs do n't define true success around that competition			1
after the calamity of last season , @entity89 was tasked with rebuilding			0
helicoptering in a few expensive signings was only part of the rebuild for a club not used to dealing with failure on the scale they suffered last season			0
in simple terms , there is no fear factor with @entity2 anymore – that went last season with @entity72 ' side capitulating regularly			2
look at @entity14 : they were woefully insipid in both legs of their @entity163 area final against @entity164 recently , and missed the chance to get to @entity166			0
@entity89 applauds at full - time after seeing off @entity14 as @entity2 continued their run in the @entity16 @entity2 are in the @entity16 quarter - finals and are still on course to make the top four in the @entity95 but give them an @entity16 tie against @entity2 and all of a sudden they become a different side			1
and what about @entity175 ? they put so much effort into that 0 - 0 draw against @entity89 's side they have n't won a game since			0
i get the tribalism of football , and i totally get that thousands and thousands of fans are absolutely desperate for @entity2 's misery to continue			2
but i also get that while @entity89 's @entity2 are not going to be remembered as brilliant , he 's got them back into the top four			0
whether the @entity2 haters can accept it or not , if the @entity190 keeps @entity2 in the top four come the end of the season , he has hit the target most @entity2 fans would have set him at the start of the campaign			0
and if that happens , no amount of spin and nonsense about @entity3 allegedly diving , @entity2 playing the long ball or @entity89 being worse than @entity72 will make the united - haters ' summer any more bearable .			2

@entity2 beat @entity14 3 - 1 at @entity23 in the @entity16 fifth round
there were claims @entity3 ' cheated ' to win a penalty
some believe @entity11 's goal should not have stood
others insist @entity47 fouled his marker before his goal
@entity2 's main aim this season is to *qualify* for the @entity35
