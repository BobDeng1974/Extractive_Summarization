video shown in court today in connection with the @entity4 murder trial shows the former football star acting calm and collected as police execute a search warrant on his house			1
@entity4 , 24 , is seen lounging on a couch in his @entity11 , @entity12 , home , and playing with his baby daughter , as multiple authorities search his property back in june of 2013			1
the search was to recover evidence as it pertained to the murder of @entity19 , a semi-professional football player who had been dating the sister of @entity4 's fianc√©e at the time of his death			2
now , @entity4 's attorneys are asking that some of that evidence obtained by officers be tossed out in court			2
a cell phone turned over by @entity4 that shows he had been in contact with @entity19 , and made plans to hang out with him close to the time he died , was obtained by the prosecution under a ' false claim of legal authority ' the defense is arguing			1
prosecutors have alleged that @entity4 and @entity19 exchanged text messages arranging a meeting on the night that @entity4 and two accomplices picked up @entity19 in @entity50 before driving him to @entity11 and killing him			0
according to @entity52 , the defense claims they did not have the proper warrant to obtain the phone			0
judge @entity55 said earlier today she would not yet rule on the motion to suppress the cell phone evidence			2
coming to help : @entity4 ( above in white ) eventually gets up to speak with the authorities no decision : judge @entity55 ( above ) said earlier today she would not yet rule on the motion to suppress the cell phone evidence victim : @entity4 has been charged with murdering @entity19 ( above ) the defense is also asking the judge for a change of venue , hoping to move the trial from @entity70 , @entity12 , to somewhere outside the @entity50 area			1
their reasoning includes a poll finding that most people in @entity76 already think their client is guilty of first - degree murder			0
@entity4 was again in court today and , just like yesterday , seen smiling and laughing			0
he is also facing murder charges in @entity81 for the july 2012 drive - by shootings of two men outside a @entity50 club .			0
