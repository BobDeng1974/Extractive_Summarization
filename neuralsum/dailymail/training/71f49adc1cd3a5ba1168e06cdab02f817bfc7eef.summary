by @entity0 @entity1 : 18:42 est , 17 december 2013 @entity2 : 18:48 est , 17 december 2013 anything for little @entity4 ... professionals are using their financial muscle to buy homes - even second homes - close to over-subscribed schools @entity9 and underhand tactics used by wealthy parents to get their children into top state schools have been laid bare in a report			1
professionals are using their financial muscle to buy homes – even second homes – near over-subscribed schools , while others are resorting to breaking the law by setting up fake addresses in desirable catchment areas			1
the @entity24 survey commissioned by education charity the @entity22 found a third of professional parents deliberately moved to an area with good schools , while one in five moved to the catchment area of a specific school			1
astonishingly one in 20 could afford to buy a second home just to use the address when applying			0
this was more than double the two per cent among parents in general			0
six per cent – double the average – admitted using a relative ’s address on application forms			0
and one in ten said they had started going to church to get their child into a faith school compared with one in 16 among parents in general			1
and one in 20 - five per cent - bought a second home to use the address when applying for a place at a specific school			1
this was more than double the two per cent among parents in general			0
the release of the survey comes two days after the chief inspector of schools attracted criticism by saying grammar schools are ‘ stuffed full of middle - class kids ’			1
sir @entity61 dismissed the argument they help social mobility on the grounds that better - off families are forcing out poorer pupils by snapping up properties in the area or paying tutors to help their children through the 11 - plus entry test			2
supporters say it is the lack of grammar schools in @entity76 - just 164 remain - that is creating the intense competition for places			2
they argue opening more would deliver the benefits grammar schools achieved before @entity82 politicians started their demise			0
the @entity24 report , commissioned by the @entity22 education charity and involving 1,173 parents of five to 16 - year - olds , found a third of professional parents deliberately moved to an area with good schools and one in five to the catchment area of a specific school			1
around two - fifths are ‘ hyperchoosers ’ who use five sources of information , such as @entity101 reports and exam results , when picking a school			2
among low - income families the figure is just 13 per cent			0
professional parents were also more likely to pay for weekly music , drama or sporting lessons and activities outside school			2
over two - thirds pay for extra-curricular activities , compared to around half of working class parents and less than a third on the lowest incomes			0
no darling , that 's an a-flat : professional parents were also more likely to pay for weekly music , drama or sporting lessons and activities outside school , found the survey by the education charity @entity22 the @entity22 called for reforms including random allocation of school places through ballots and free transport for poor pupils to give them access to a choice of schools			1
chairman sir @entity135 said : ‘ this research suggests that those with money actively choose to live near good schools , employ tutors and ensure their children have extra lessons and enrichment activities that are often too expensive for other families to afford			1
‘ this provides a significant advantage in school choice and in developing the cultural capital that is so important to social mobility and later success			0
‘ education is about more than what happens at school and providing a more level playing field in school choice and out - of - school activities is essential if every child is to achieve his or her potential			0
’ however , report co-author professor @entity160 , of @entity161 , added : ‘ our findings also demonstrate the extent to which some working class parents are enacting “ informed choice ” and policymakers may also learn from their practices			0

a third of well - off parents have moved home to an new area for a school
others break the law by setting up fake addresses in catchment areas
@entity22 calls for reforms to make access to good schools fairer
