it is the ‘ home ’ of one of the greatest villains ever to stalk our nightmares – a place where only the brave might venture , and the more nervous might fear a sharp pain in the neck			0
alternatively , it might be seen as a splendid royal palace in a less - seen part of @entity12			0
perfectly picturesque : whatever its links to @entity17 , there is no doubting the beauty of @entity20 high up on its hilltop : @entity20 has long been linked to the story of @entity17 - as played by @entity24 in the 1958 film adaptation of the @entity27 novel either way , these pictures give a fascinating insight into the fortress that supposedly played host to one of the darkest figures of @entity12 mythology – count dracula			1
@entity20 – which perches on a dramatic hilltop near @entity38 in central @entity39 – has long been linked to the toothsome vampire			1
constructed in the early 14th century , it is open to the public , who are able to peer into its creaky rooms and dark passageways			0
@entity47 - eyed tourists will point out that @entity17 did not exist			0
and they would – rather obviously – be correct			0
the most famous vampire of all was , of course , created by the @entity51 novelist @entity27 in his iconic gothic novel @entity17 , published in 1897			2
who goes there ? a lot of people , actually - the castle receives half a million visitors every year grand designs : the gothic four - poster bed fits in perfectly with the legend of @entity17 in spooky @entity20 - although @entity27 never actually visited the area @entity27 also never visited @entity39 – let alone @entity20			1
however , the man who is thought to have been the spark for @entity27 ’s dastardly creation – @entity66 of @entity67 – is believed to have a more direct link to the fortress			1
better known as @entity66 , this notoriously ' uncompromising ' nobleman ruled @entity67 , in what is now @entity39 , in the 15th century ( probably 1456 to 1462 ) – a time when the region was under attack from @entity76 forces , and staunch tactics were needed			1
@entity66 – a member of the @entity78 – gained his vicious reputation thanks to his reputed habit of running through his enemies with spikes			2
gloomy spaces : the castle supposedly played host ( in the dungeons ) to the notorious @entity66 in 1462 dining out : for those looking to feast on more than just blood , the eerie dining room is decorated with statues and works of art museum display : over half a million vampire fans flock to the @entity39 castle each year , to wander the corridors of a place which loosely inspired @entity27 following suit : the castle clings to its 14th century roots with armour and medieval weaponry on display and he may have spent a little time at @entity20 – though not at his leisure			1
some historical sources say that @entity66 was captured by the @entity109 king @entity108 in 1462 , and transferred to the fortress , where he spent two months languishing in its dungeons – a little sojourn that must have done little for his fiery temper			2
the modern - day owners of @entity20 underline this link as one of their main reasons for marketing the property as the ‘ home of @entity17 ’			2
spooky : the castle is steeped in history			0
it is believed that @entity66 was locked in the castle dungeons for two months in the 15th century they also claim that the castle bears a notable resemblance to the terrifying hilltop fortress described so stirringly in @entity27 ’s narrative			2
while conceding that @entity27 did not travel to @entity39 before ( or after ) he penned his masterpiece , they also argue that ‘ the imaginary depiction of @entity134 from the etching in the first edition of “ @entity17 ” is strikingly similar to @entity20 and no other in all of @entity39			1
’ whether or not this is enough of a connection for historians or literary academics , there is no doubt that @entity20 is popular – it attracts some half a million tourists a year			0
those who visit the fortress – which perches on a bluff 20 miles south - west of @entity38 – find a structure that is certainly beautiful , whatever its ties to vampires			0
enough to send shivers down your spine : @entity20 looks even more eerie when illuminated at night - particularly with a full moon rising behind perfectly picturesque : whatever its links to @entity17 , there is no doubting the beauty of @entity20 view from above : the huge castle dominates the surrounding landscape in the beautiful @entity39 landscape many of its echoing chambers are fitted out with furniture and fittings acquired by @entity169 @entity168 – the last @entity170 of @entity39 , in the early 20th century			1
however , peer behind that thick velvet curtain , or wander down that dimly lit corridor , and you never know who you may encounter .			0

@entity20 is tied to the iconic story of the *aristocratic* @entity39 vampire
@entity66 - the spark for the tale - was reputedly *imprisoned* here
the fortress sits in central @entity39 , attracting legions of vampire fans
