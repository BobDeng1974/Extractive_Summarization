a mythical metal said by ancient @entity1 to be found in the lost city of @entity3 has been recovered from a ship that sunk 2,600 years ago off the coast of @entity6			1
marine archaeologists found 39 ingots of what they believe is ' orichalcum ' on the sandy seabed among the wreck of a trading vessel that sank 1,000 feet off the coast of the town of @entity16 , in southern @entity6			1
the wreck is the fifth ancient ship to be recovered off the coast of the town			2
@entity3 was first described by the @entity1 philosopher @entity30 more than 2,000 years ago			1
while many believe the story is a myth created by @entity30 to illustrate his theories about politics , others insist it is based on a real historical disaster			2
according to @entity30 's account , written around @entity39 , @entity3 was a major sea power located in the @entity41			1
it was larger than ancient @entity43 and @entity28 ( modern @entity44 ) put together , and was ' the way to the other islands , and from these you might pass to the whole of the opposite continent '			0
his account included detailed descriptions of the island - with mountains in the north and along the coast , and a plain in the south			0
its kings were descended from @entity61 - the god of sea - but their divine lineage became diluted as they mixed with mortals			0
by around 9600 bc the island had conquered much of @entity67 and @entity68 and enslaved its enemies			0
this date would make the city nearly as old as the end of the last ice age and pre-dates the earliest recorded city states , found in what is now @entity76 , so seems rather unlikely			0
after a failed attempt to invade @entity79 , the entire island sank into the sea ' in a single day and night of misfortune '			0
over the centuries , scholars have attempted to locate the real @entity3 - believing the account was based on a real ancient superpower			2
one of the most plausible theories is that @entity30 was describing the @entity88 civilisation on @entity89 and the neighbouring island of @entity91 which was devastated by a massive volcanic eruption around @entity93			2
some believe the @entity3 myth was inspired by the @entity97 floods of around 5000bc - an event that may have also generated the flood stories which appeared in the @entity100			2
professor @entity101 , an archaeologist at the office of the @entity103 in @entity6 , claimed the metal they had discovered in the remains of the ship was probably the mythical and highly prized red metal orichalcum			1
analysis of the metal ingots revealed they were made from an alloy of copper and zinc with traces of nickel , lead and iron			1
professor @entity101 told the @entity119 that the x-ray fluorescent analysis of the metal had confirmed that it was orichalcum			1
he said : ' the discovery is unique and exceptional because it is the fist time that we find oricalcum ingots			0
' speaking to @entity125 , he added : ' nothing similar has ever been found			0
' we knew orichalcum from ancient texts and a few ornamental objects			0
' the wreck dates to the first half of the sixth century			0
' it was found about 1,000 feet from @entity135 's coast at a depth of 10 feet			1
' if the metal discovered by @entity139 and his team is really the mythical orichalcum , then it lends support to the idea of @entity3 as being a real place			1
the existence of the island is greatly debated among historians and archaeologists			0
some believe it is entirely fictional while others claim stories of the ' @entity153 ' may have been based on a real historical location that was drowned by rising sea levels or a tsunami			0
the @entity159 city of @entity160 , for example , was lost 1,200 years ago when it was engulfed by the sea			0
most of the legend of @entity3 comes from the work of the @entity1 philosopher @entity30 , who describes how the great nation was submerged beneath the @entity41 after falling out of favour with the @entity167			1
@entity30 mentions orichalcum in the @entity170 dialogue and describes @entity3 as flashing with the ' red light ' of the metal			1
he wrote that orichalcum was highly prized and second only in value to gold			0
it was mined in the mythical island and covered the surfaces of @entity61 's temple			0
the existence of this metal and its composition has since been widely debated , but it is commonly thought to be a brass - like alloy			1
brass is made from copper and zinc			2
it is thought to have been made through a process called cementation , which reacts zinc ore with charcoal and copper in a crucible			1
this map of @entity3 - oriented with south at the top - was drawn by 17th century scholar @entity198 , who pinpointed the mythical continent as being in the mid-atlantic before it was lost to the sea professor @entity101 , centre , and his team of divers discovered the metal ignots of what they believe to be the mythical metal of orichalcum on a 2,600 - year - old shipwreck found off the coast of @entity16 in @entity6 x-ray fluorescence of the ingots found off the coast of @entity16 show they were made from 75 - 80 per cent copper , 15 - 20 per cent zinc and small amounts of nickel , lead and iron			1
professor @entity101 told the @entity119 : ' the shipwreck is dated to the beginning of 6th century @entity224 ' we can not say how big is the vessel because we have to dig into the sand to recover what it is left of the wooden hull			2
but i presume that she was about 15 metres ( 49 feet ) long			0
' it is a new shipwreck unknown before this discovery			0
' ' she was sailing to @entity16 and was entering the harbor situated at the mouth of @entity16			2
' probably during the entrance there was some mistake in the maneuvering because of heavy sea and the ship went into the sandy beach ' professor @entity101 said that they also found some @entity1 vases , a terracotta figure of the @entity249 and some wood in the wreck			1
he added : ' the finding confirms that about a century after its foundation in @entity255 , @entity135 grew to become a wealthy city with artisan workshops specialised in the production of prized artifacts			0
' the shipwreck with the ingots was found 1,000 feet off shore of the town of @entity16 in the sourthern part of @entity6 the metal found on the sea floor off @entity6 ( above ) was found to be an alloy of copper , zinc , lead , nickle and iron statues like this one above from the sunken @entity159 city of @entity160 have recently been rediscovered by marine archaeologists , raising hopes that if @entity3 did ever exist then it may still be found under the sea however , some experts disagree about the composition of orichalcum			1
@entity281 , a former physics professor at the @entity282 , believes the metal has its origins in the @entity286 civilisation that developed in the @entity287 in around 1,200 bc. he claims the metal alloy is made from copper , gold and silver			1
he claims that the discovery off the coast of @entity16 is not true orichalcum			1
indeed in @entity297 , coins made from brass were also said to be made from orichalcum			0
professor @entity101 said that while he did not believe @entity3 existed , he found the idea of it appealing			2
he said : ' i think it was a @entity30 metaphore			2
but i am happy if this story will continue to raise and feed our fantasy			0
' the lost civilisation of @entity3 was reputed to have many treasures including buildings clad in the metal orichalcum that were lost to the sea after the people there apparently fell out of favour with the gods there have been many locations around the world suggested as potential sites for the lost island of @entity3			1

marine archaeologists found 39 ingots of ' orichalcum ' off the town of @entity16
they were discovered on the sandy sea floor in a wreck under 10ft of water
experts say they are the mythical metal @entity30 claimed was from @entity3
analysis has shown they are an alloy of copper , zinc , lead , iron and nickel
shipwreck is a 2,600 year old cargo vessel thought to be from @entity1
*researchers* believe it was sunk in a storm just 1,000 feet from shore
