grass warrior : @entity27 emerges from the vegetation and scurries over to the @entity12 camera which was set up in @entity15 in @entity4 , @entity16 , to record the effects of climate change activists had hoped to show how the alpine tundra - land where there is no vegetation because the ground is always frozen - is shrinking as more and more trees grow higher up the mountain			1
but instead , the marmot , who lives in the tundra , took actions into his own hands in a bid to protect his home			0
a @entity12 spokesperson said : ' though we did nâ€™t capture the time - lapse video of @entity15 that we intended to , we captured something much cooler ... @entity51			1

@entity12 has also launched a thermal airship at @entity15 to highlight with large banners reading ' @entity70 exports fuel climate change			0
