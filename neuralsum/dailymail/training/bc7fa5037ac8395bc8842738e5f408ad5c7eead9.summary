the unbearable frustration of @entity2 ’s time at @entity3 is perhaps best summed up by the red card in this fixture last season when , no sooner was he fit than he was suspended , a victim of @entity8 ’ acting prowess			1
that campaign was doomed to never get going , for @entity2			0
he came back , scored a couple , missed the @entity13 and was injured again			0
there have been times when this season has threatened to go the same way and then there was on sunday when @entity2 lit the claret - and - blue touch - paper with his first goals of the season , two quite brilliant headers , to propel his team into the top three			2

@entity52 stayed on his feet and struck the post with his shot from a tight angle			0
referee @entity81 pulled play back and showed @entity60 a straight red card the reverse angle showed how @entity60 clearly impeded @entity52 as he flew towards goal @entity52 smashed home @entity3 's third goal with just a couple of minutes remaining as victory was sealed @entity52 reveals a t - shirt whilst celebrating his 87th - minute goal to secure @entity3 's win over @entity31 @entity111 miles @entity3 105.7 65.7 @entity49 90 10,8 6.7 @entity50 90 10.6 6.6 @entity47 90 10.2 6.3 @entity31 104.5 64.9 @entity69 90 12.0 7.5 @entity68 90 10.8 6.7 @entity112 90 10.7 6.6 little wonder he reacted with such exhilaration after his second , sprinting to embrace @entity39 ’s backroom team as a gesture of thanks to the medics who helped him through the months of injury gloom			1
@entity2 wiped out @entity123 ’s opener with a giant leap and a trademark flex of the neck muscles and a flick of the ponytail in response to a cross by @entity42 , and won the game with another nostalgia - inducing climb to convert @entity50 ’s corner , 23 minutes from time			1
not since @entity134 has the elite level of @entity137 football seen anyone attack the aerial ball quite like @entity2 and it was a thrill to see him once again dominating airspace , terrorising centre - halves @entity64 and @entity63 with his physical presence			2
@entity39 drooled on about the lost art of heading the ball			0
@entity144 will watch with interest over the winter months			0
it is more than two years since his last @entity36 cap			0
@entity52 , back from injury , added @entity3 ’s third , his eighth in 10 games since signing from @entity152 in august , but not before he had been involved in @entity60 ’s sending off , which left the visitors a man short for the final 20 minutes			1
@entity60 dashed from his penalty box after @entity52 had evaded @entity64 in pursuit of a pass from @entity2			1
@entity77 later claimed it was handball as he nudged it past the ‘ keeper but @entity52 stumbled , but the striker kept his feet and shot from a tight angle			2
the ball hit a post , but referee @entity81 had already blown his whistle for a free - kick to the home team and showed @entity60 a red card			2
fourth official @entity171 told @entity39 that @entity52 ’s effort would have been ruled out had it gone in			0
@entity2 celebrates after heading @entity3 level four minutes before half - time			1
it was the striker 's first league goal in 878 minutes @entity2 soars at the back post to head @entity42 's deep cross back across @entity60 and into the net for 1 - 1 @entity2 waves to the crowd as he celebrates with team - mates @entity182 , @entity184 and @entity49 following his first - half goal the intricate passing and movement that led to @entity2 's first goal on 41 minutes from our match zone service the influence of @entity2 right across the @entity3 forward line is shown by his heat map from the @entity31 match @entity123 celebrates after giving @entity31 the lead after 19 minutes at @entity86			1
it was his 19th goal of the calendar year @entity31 players @entity66 , @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity68 and @entity112 celebrate @entity123 's strike the build - up that led to @entity123 giving @entity31 the lead after 19 minutes at @entity86 from our match zone service @entity77 vowed to appeal the decision			1
he wanted to know how it could be judged a clear goal - scoring opportunity if he did n’t score			0
regardless , the damage was done , even if the visitors rallied briefly before going under			0
@entity52 , returning from injury as a half - time sub , was a menace on the break against 10 men			1
he escaped @entity64 again to pick up a pass by @entity182 and hit the other post before he finally grabbed the third , in the 87th minute , set up by @entity2 ’s pass			0
it glossed the score - line nicely on a fabulous day for @entity3			2
they have won three in a row , they are third for the first time in 15 years , @entity2 is fit , @entity52 can not stop scoring and they are have the look of a strong and solid squad , capable of converting this burst of form into a memorable season			2
two on - loan players also impressed : @entity232 ’s @entity42 rampaging forward from right - back and @entity234 ’s @entity182 dominating the ball in central areas of the pitch			1
@entity3 manager @entity39 finds himself swamped by bubbles as he watches his team in action against @entity31 @entity66 attempts to set @entity31 on another attack during sunday 's @entity243 contest at the @entity86 @entity31 's @entity73 feels the force of an @entity2 tackle from behind as both teams tried to impose themselves in the first - half @entity3 's @entity49 slides in to clear the ball from @entity31 's @entity112 during the first half @entity182 ’s vision and passing was excellent , almost good enough to forgive his infuriating habit of throwing up his hands in dismay whenever a team - mate failed to read his thoughts or produce a finish to match his pass			1
the pair linked up for @entity2 ’s equaliser after @entity31 had taken a 19th minute lead , a slick counter-attack led by @entity69 and @entity70 into the space behind @entity42 and converted by @entity72			1
once the @entity263 applied a firm side - footer to @entity70 ’s cross and there was never any doubt where it would end up			2
it was his seventh goal in nine @entity243 games			0
his game oozed such swagger and confidence that it was a shock when he missed the target from 20 yards , a few minutes later , when @entity274 had been dispossessed , deep inside his own half			0
@entity2 ’s self - esteem has not been fuelled by a similar glut of goals since his permanent £ 15million move from @entity280			0
it has been a difficult time , blighted by injuries , but he led the line well yesterday and dominated in the air from the start			0
when @entity42 crossed from the right and @entity2 dropped away from the centre - halves to climb high above @entity61 to direct a text - book centre - forward ’s header back across goal , into the opposite top corner			1
it was his first of the season and his first at upon @entity86 since march 2013 , when he was on loan from @entity280			0
@entity123 rattled the bar on the break with a ferocious drive , but @entity2 appeared unmarked at a corner to head @entity3 into the lead			2
@entity77 fumed about his team ’s defending and that fact they had failed to reach their usual levels , but @entity2 can have that sort of effect on defenders , when he is fit and in the groove			0
@entity77 , the @entity31 manager , issues instructions from his technical area at @entity86 @entity123 gets a firm grip on @entity182 as @entity3 's @entity312 midfielder tries to reach the ball in front of him @entity3 striker @entity2 chases @entity31 's @entity66 for the ball during the first - half @entity44 of @entity3 clears the ball under pressure from @entity31 striker @entity123 during the opening minutes of the game @entity49 was the cover star on sunday 's matchday programme as @entity3 took on @entity31 at @entity86 supporters queue for a pre-match burger at one of the food stalls around @entity86			1

@entity3 moved up to third in the @entity243 table after 3 - 1 home win over 10 - man @entity31
the visitors went in front when @entity123 fired home @entity70 's cut - back after 19 minutes
the @entity3 levelled when @entity2 headed home @entity42 's cross four minutes before half - time
@entity36 striker @entity2 then put @entity3 ahead with another towering header midway through second - half
@entity31 were *reduced* to 10 men when goalkeeper @entity60 saw red for impeding @entity52
and @entity52 lashed home goal no 3 in the closing minutes after running onto @entity2 's header
