by @entity0 published : 18:26 est , 6 october 2013 updated : 15:47 est , 13 november 2013 a furry critter has been spotted with wild white hair - and a striking resemblance to @entity4			1
the tiny caterpillar was found by @entity6 , 45 , who noticed the bug on the trunk of a walnut tree in her garden in @entity11 in @entity12 , @entity13 she immediately called over her daughter @entity14 who could n't stop laughing at the bug 's fuzzy hairdo , which sprouts out uncontrollably			1
with its shock of white hair it resembles scientific genius @entity4 famed physicist @entity4 , who was almost as well - known for for his shock of white hair as his incredible brain they took photos of the bizarre creature and after making them bigger on her computer @entity6 noticed the insect 's uncanny likeliness to the the @entity31 - born physicist , who was famous for developing the general theory of relativity and forever changing our understanding of the universe			1
when she researched her finding she discovered the caterpillar was of the @entity39 species , found in parts of @entity41 except south - western states			2
she said : ' i was amazed at how fuzzy it was and just how much it looked like @entity4 too			1
my daughter and i observed him for quite a while - it was an active little critter			0
' the first time put the two side by side it was funny but an amazing likeness			0
it has the hair like @entity4 but with its distinct markings it makes it look like the famous picture of @entity4 with his tongue stuck out			1
' the tiny caterpillar was found by @entity6 , 45 , who noticed it on the trunk of a tree in her garden in @entity11 in @entity12			1
@entity4 developed the general theory of relativity , one of the two pillars of modern physics he said : ' i 've always enjoyed looking and learning about what is living around me			2
insects are pretty easy too as you do n't have to go far to find many			0
' we 're fortunate to have woods behind our house so we do n't have to go further than the garden			2
' there always seems to be some kind of insect in a keeper in the house , especially caterpillars			0
right now we have two @entity85 caterpillars munching away on maple leaves which we have raised from eggs			0
' in 1921 @entity4 won the @entity88 for physics and was so famous that in the period before @entity91 he would be stopped on the street by people wanting him to explain the theory of relativity			2
his ingenious way of handling it was to apologise and explain that he just happened to look like the great man			0
he died in @entity99 , @entity100 in 1955 at the age of 76 .			0

the *fluffy* bug was discovered in a garden in @entity12 in the @entity13
