by @entity0 @entity2 supremo @entity1 has revealed there is no reason why a woman ca n’t play the world ’s most famous @entity6			1
@entity1 , 52 , who is the show ’s lead writer and head producer , said he had already put plot lines and references in previous shows to make it possible			1
he said : ‘ there is absolutely no reason why a woman ca n’t play @entity2 and i am the person who has made that possible			2
it features @entity26 and @entity27 as well as @entity28 ( not pictured ) playing three different versions of the @entity6 but @entity1 insisted it was important to get the right person for the role and that it would be wrong to cast ‘ a woman ’ just as it would be to cast ‘ a man ’			1
he said : ‘ you cast an individual who you think is perfect for the part now and you do n’t make rules for yourself before you start			1
‘ it is a question of who is the person who sets your brain on fire as the doctor			2
right now , without question – and everybody seems to have had the same reaction – that person is @entity49			2
’ @entity1 ’s comments coincided with last night ’s 50th anniversary special , @entity52 , which starred @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity28 playing three different versions of the doctor			1
his support for a female doctor does , however , put him at odds with @entity58 , the fifth doctor , who earlier this month said it would be wrong to cast a woman in the role			1
@entity49 , who is best known for the comedy @entity62 , has yet to make his first appearance but speculation continues that his eventual replacement will be a woman			2
female favourites : clockwise from top left , @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 and @entity73 last night bookmakers @entity74 were offering odds of 8/1 that the role would go to a woman the next time it became vacant			1
several actresses have been linked to the part – including @entity71 , who played the doctor ’s companion @entity80 , @entity82 star @entity73 , @entity72 and @entity83 - winning @entity70			1
@entity1 , who spent a year planning the anniversary special which was broadcast in 94 countries , said the casting of @entity49 had been one of the show ’s biggest - ever gambles			1
heritage : ex-doctor @entity90 , left , waits with four other previous @entity6 at the 50th anniversary convention in @entity92 on friday he said : ‘ he is an older man for a start and unlike some of the other actors who have taken on the role , he is already famous			1
’ @entity1 added that last night ’s special had sent the show in a new direction			1
he said : ‘ every so often @entity2 becomes a brand new show and it did that again last night			0
‘ people who saw last night ’s episode will now realise that the doctor is on a very different journey – a different journey than the one he had			0
his mission statement has changed			0
’ yesterday @entity90 was one of the former doctors who took part in a 50th anniversary convention at @entity92 ’s @entity113			1
the new doctor who made a surprise appearance in the sci - fi favourite ’s 50th anniversary television special last night			1
@entity49 ’s appearance lasted just a split second and a global audience of more than 100 million had to make do with a shot of just his eyes			2
@entity49 , 55 , joined his predecessors in the anniversary episode @entity52 to see off a threat from the doctor ’s old enemy the @entity128			2
first look at the new @entity2 : @entity49 appeared briefly last night 's 50th anniversary special but the @entity131 show also saw the return of some familiar faces			1
@entity90 , the longest serving doctor , appeared at the end of the episode , and former companion @entity71 was also part of the action			1
but the episode was dominated by a storyline featuring departing @entity2 @entity26 and two earlier incarnations , @entity27 and @entity28			2
writer @entity1 packed the episode with one - liners , and some of the best jokes centred on the different personalities of the squabbling @entity6			1
the show ended with a spectacular line - up of all the previous doctors			2
you know you ’re getting old when the @entity149 are getting younger			0
you know you ’re ancient when you remember your crush on the first @entity2 , @entity152			0
and you know you ’re closer to death ( and possibly senile ) when you watch the show and have n’t the slightest idea what is going on			0
the 50 - year anniversary special began in spectacular fashion – the special effects and sound were as good as those on any major @entity164 movie			1
@entity71 ( left ) and @entity28 ( right ) appeared in the doctor who 50th anniversary special last night the plot , however , left more to be desired			1
after receiving orders from one of those @entity171 women ( the one who talks like			0
well , @entity169 , except , in this case , she was just the messenger from @entity173 ) , the current @entity2 ( @entity26 ) delivered some good gags , confused as to why the wrong queen was on the throne			0
ms @entity171 threw up at some point and became a @entity178			0
do n’t ask me why			0
then we had @entity28 ( the @entity181 ) finding @entity71 dressed in a sheet / shroud and possibly coming on to him			2
i was already hiding behind the sofa , but for different reasons from those that prompted me to do so 50 years ago ! the plot grew ever more complicated when @entity26 met the previous doctor , @entity27 , who had been wooing @entity169 on a horse – although from my @entity191 ( @entity192 ) , it might have been @entity193 and @entity194 in @entity195			0
‘ you ’re my future selves ? ’ asked @entity28 , when he met the pair in a forest , shortly after @entity26 and @entity27 had taken it in turns to wear a fez ( although , again , from @entity191 , it might have been @entity203 )			0
you wait for ever for a doctor to come along and then three come along together			0
as the threesome stood poised at the red button , ready to destroy the world , they opted to follow the path of courage – cue close - up of everyone ’s cyberman - style glowing teeth			0
the episode was full of great lines , some of them hilarious , but ultimately the episode was a triumph of style over less impressive substance			0
and , thankfully , there were @entity128			0
nothing , however , will come close to the terror of those first tin men with laryngitis in black and white			0
except , perhaps , @entity171 ’s vomit .			0

@entity1 says there is ' no reason ' a female @entity6 could **n't** happen
but added ' you cast an individual ' and that he wo **n't** ' make rules ' on *gender*
