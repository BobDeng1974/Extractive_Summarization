by @entity0 published : 12:34 est , 11 june 2013 updated : 13:37 est , 11 june 2013 a couple ’s amusing @entity2 advert for their clapped - out family car has sparked a bidding war resulting in the price of the run - around rocketing to more than £ 20,000			1
@entity7 and @entity8 , from @entity9 , @entity10 , decided to take a different approach to selling their beloved banger on the fiercely competitive second - hand market by turning its dents , scratches and dodgy smells into sought - after features			1
but the cheeky listing has sent bidders into a frenzy and the price of the silver @entity25 saloon has shot up by tens of thousands of pounds			1
for sale : @entity8 poses on top of the @entity25 which has been advertised on @entity2 in a display of honesty rarely shown by your average second - hand car salesman , mr @entity7 wrote on the website : ' if you are looking for an immaculate , well maintained example of a @entity25 e320 @entity34 ... you have come to the wrong place			1
' if however , you are low on self - esteem , with a strapped budget , but shooting for the stars , welcome to my auction			0
' in more candid sales patter , mr @entity7 added : ' @entity42 on arches etc. as expected from a vehicle of this fine vintage			1
also a couple of dinks from a scrape with @entity48 and the missus ’s foot			0
on the market : @entity8 posted this photo of herself alongside the advert for the @entity25 ' as you can see from the photos this car has seen things ... things it can not forget			1
' i have owned this car for three years and up to then it had been lovingly cared for and maintained			2
' since owning the vehicle , it has been thrashed , raced , rallied , killed three deer , and the interior has been smashed up in a domestic , not to mention the time my wife booted the wing because i suggested she eat a salad or two ( please refer to photo of foot next to dent for reference )			2
' the car was lovingly cleaned in preparation for the 2012 summer olympics , and maybe in need of another one now			2
the couple 's @entity2 ad for the clapped - out family car has gone viral sparking a bidding war @entity79 : the @entity25 has surprisingly started a bidding war on @entity2 despite showing signs of wear and tear battered : the @entity2 advert for the rusty @entity25 includes more honest than usual photos and has become an internet hit mr @entity7 is honest about about the wear and tear his @entity25 , which has 160,000 miles on the clock , has endured			1
he wrote : ' as for the bad bits ... there are none ... just kidding there are lots			0
' the cd changer in the boot does n’t work , but the radio does ( we have already preset the channels to suit our clientele )			0
' the air conditioning is n’t working , but the electric windows do , so bonus			0
the car smokes when you boot it hard			2
' the rear sub frame bushes could probably do with being replaced			0
' spacious : @entity8 was even photographed inside the boot of the car to show how big the boot is candid : @entity7 photographed his partner @entity8 posing with the clapped - out @entity25 he photographed @entity114 banks posing with the car in a tongue - in - cheek photo shoot			1
@entity7 wrote : ' boot is big enough for two small or one big person			1
car sale comes with complementary hostage			2
' one prospective buyer wanted to know if there would be space to fit @entity126 ’s @entity125 presenters @entity127 in			0
miss @entity8 said : ' we did want to sell the car but when we were taking pictures of it and we saw how bad it was we thought lets do it in a funny way			1
now it ’s gone crazy			0
it was just meant to be a joke			0
' however , despite the humorous nature of the advert they requested that only people who were serious about buying should bid - and refunds are not available .			0

@entity7 and @entity8 from @entity9 posted the advert
they honestly *describe* the vehicle drawing attention to rust and scratches
@entity8 even appears in photographs posing on top of the car
@entity156 has sparked a bidding war with the price of the @entity25 now at more than £ 20,000
