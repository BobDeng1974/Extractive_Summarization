by @entity1 reporter published : 09:50 est , 9 august 2012 updated : 12:28 est , 9 august 2012 @entity3 has been driven so ' mad ' by @entity5 cycling success they are accusing @entity7 of cheating , @entity2 said today			1
the prime minister said the @entity3 had found the sight of the @entity11 covered in @entity12 to greet @entity15 ' @entity14 victory ' a bit hard to take '			0
and the thinly - veiled war of words continued today after apparent @entity3 sneering at @entity21 's all - conquering triumphs in the velodrome			1
rubbing it in : @entity2 said the sight of @entity15 surrounded by @entity12 after his tour win would have been ' hard to take ' for the @entity3 mr @entity2 , pictured with @entity3 president @entity26 at the @entity28 handball , had to endure ribbing from the @entity3 premier over the two countrys ' medals - a position which has since reversed in the prime minister 's favour with riders and coaches raising questions about the legality of @entity7 's bikes , mr @entity2 said one @entity3 media outlet he was interviewed by ' virtually accused us of cheating '			1
just over a week ago , mr @entity2 was forced to suffer a ribbing by @entity3 president @entity26 about the relative performances of their two countries at that point			1
mr @entity26 jokingly thanked @entity21 for ' rolling out the red carpet ' for @entity3 athletes to win medals - after joining the pm to watch his country play handball			1
but the tables have been dramatically turned since then , with @entity3 now having only eight gold medals so far to @entity21 's 22 - and 20 fewer of all colours			1
the velodrome has proved a particular cauldron for cross-channel rivalry , @entity5 domination of the podium sparking irate suggestions of foul play			0
and the latest row comes a few months after @entity15 reacted angrily to a @entity3 tv reporter asking him about doping during the @entity14			1
@entity3 's @entity66 ( left ) had to make do with the silver medal as @entity21 's @entity68 swept to victory in the men 's sprint final @entity21 's trio of @entity75 ( left ) , @entity68 ( centre ) and sir @entity73 also beat the @entity3 into second in the team sprint final mr @entity2 , in an interview with @entity79 on @entity80 , suggested @entity3 frustration was a sign of just how well the @entity5 system was working			1
' we 've got a system that seems to be delivering			0
it 's driving the @entity3 mad , ' he said			2
' i did an interview with @entity3 television yesterday and they virtually accused us of cheating			1
i think they found the @entity12 on the @entity11 a bit hard to take			0
' we have got a great system so let 's build on that and then when we go to @entity97 in 2016 we can have a good experience			0
' the premier also picked @entity101 's victory in the 10,000 metres as his stand - out moment from the @entity103 so far			0
mr @entity2 , who was in the stadium on ' @entity105 ' when @entity7 won three gold medals in track and field , said : ' when i think of the most moving moment for me on that saturday night , there he was , this sort of slightly lonely figure with the team of @entity112 and the team of @entity114 chasing him down and trying to stretch him out by having these short bursts of pace and he just kept plugging away and that last lap was just unbelievably emotional and exciting			2
' sacre bleu : @entity3 sports magazine @entity121 went for the @entity5 cycling team 's jugular after its phenomenal success a recent poll in @entity3 magazine @entity121 asked people to vote on whether they thought @entity5 cyclists had cheated at the @entity128 mr @entity26 's ' red carpet ' comments were a pointed retort to mr @entity2 's pledge to do the same for @entity3 businessmen fleeing a proposed 75 % top rate of income tax			1
relations between the pair have been strained since the prime minister declined to meet the then @entity139 hopeful during a campaign trip to the @entity5 ahead of may 's election			0
attempts to paint that as matter of protocol and not a snub were somewhat undermined by mr @entity2 's subsequent meeting with @entity148 @entity147 presidential candidate @entity146			2
and it was @entity151 leader @entity150 who was not only first @entity5 politician invited to the @entity154 for talks with the new president but was granted a rare public handshake			0
last week , with @entity21 still languishing in the medal table , mr @entity26 also joked that @entity5 sports fans could be heartened by seeing their medals as part of the @entity163 tally			1
' we will put the @entity3 medals in the @entity163 bag , and that way the @entity5 can be happy to be @entity163 , ' he said			2
@entity5 cycling chiefs have laughed off @entity3 claims that ' magic wheels ' - with secret technology hidden inside them - may have been the secret to the team 's phenomenal success in the track cycling events , where its riders walked away with seven golds from the 10 events			2
stars of cycling : @entity182 and @entity15 are just two @entity7 riders who have contributed to the home nation 's formidable cycling medal haul all - conquering : women 's team pursuit riders @entity188 , @entity189 and @entity190 also claimed cycling gold for @entity7 - much to the apparent annoyance of the @entity3 kings of the track : sir @entity73 , another cycling hero , is now @entity21 's most decorated olympian after his two golds at @entity128 and they also pointed out that the wheels in question were made in @entity3			1
earlier in the competition , there was another controversy when @entity75 admitted to deliberately crashing to earn a restart of the team sprint , in which @entity21 went on to beat @entity3 to the gold medal			2
despite complaints , the authorities judged that no rules had been broken			0
mr @entity2 said the main lesson so far from the @entity103 in terms of future success was ' keep doing what we are doing , the way that elite sport has been organised and the way we back our olympians '			0
' i have met a lot of the people involved in that			0
they are brilliant , ' he said			0
it was also essential to find some way of ' bottling this volunteering ' , he said , outlining efforts to get the half a million people giving up their time as @entity229 and in other roles to continue their efforts with local sports clubs and other organisations .			0
