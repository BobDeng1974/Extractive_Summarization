by @entity0 published : 19:01 est , 6 november 2012 updated : 01:18 est , 7 november 2012 there are few things more depressing on a car journey than the ‘ flud , flud , flud ’ sound of a flat tyre			1
you invariably seem to get a puncture when it ’s dark , when it ’s raining and when the car is laden with tired kids , luggage and a front seat passenger reluctant to get their hands dirty , but unusually eager to point out what you ’re doing wrong			1
changing a spare tyre is hassle enough , but in recent years , coping with a flat has become even more stressful			1
for without fanfare , motor manufacturers have begun to phase them out			1
there are few things more depressing on a car journey than hearing the ' flud , flud , flud ' sound of a flat tyre says , @entity0 each year , tens of thousands of stranded drivers lift up the boot carpets of new cars looking for a spare and a jack , only to discover a ‘ tyre repair kit ’ – an electric pump , a bottle of sealant and instructions written by someone with only a passing familiarity with cars and the @entity40 language			1
i have to admit i know almost nothing about car repair			1
ask me to change a spark plug and i ’m baffled			0
tell me my ‘ big end ’ has gone and i ’ll probably call the doctor			0
but i do know how to change a spare tyre , and that admittedly basic knowledge is a badge of pride			1
i know about loosening the nuts before jacking up the car			2
i know where to fit the jack			0
and i know how to give a withering look when someone offers an opinion			0
so i resent car manufacturers making my one car - related skill redundant			1
and they are making it redundant in force			0
out of the top ten best - selling cars in @entity66 , only the @entity64 now comes with a full spare tyre as standard			1
lucky owners of top - of - the - range new cars get skinny space - saving spare tyres that take up less room in the boot , but which will keep them going for 50 miles or so until the driver can get home or to a garage			2
a few find their cars are delivered kitted with four ‘ run - flat tyres ’ — tyres with strengthened walls that stay hard even when the air has escaped			0
but the unfortunate ones — the owners of the bottom - of - the - range @entity85 , @entity87 and @entity88 , for example — have to make do with a sealant kit			0
if you ’ve ever tried to use an emergency tyre inflation kit , you ’ll know how awkward and messy they can be			2
drivers have to connect a pipe from a compressor in the repair kit to the flat tyre ’s valve , plug the compressor into the cigarette lighter and switch on the compressor to fill the tyre with air and sealant			2
many car manufacturers are slowly phasing out the spare tyre then you have to unplug it all , drive the car for two miles to disperse the sealant throughout the inside of the tyre to tackle the air leak , stop and park , plug the compressor back into the tyre and cigarette lighter , and pump up the tyre fully			1
even then there ’s no guarantee you can drive the car away			2
sealant kits only work with holes 4mm or smaller			0
bigger gashes are impossible to repair — a fact you will discover after an hour or so fiddling around on the roadside			0
and even if you can get puncture kits to work , many garages refuse to repair tyres if they have been filled with sealant , claiming it is too time consuming and expensive to clean them out			0
a £ 15 puncture repair can end up costing the £ 100 price of a replacement tyre			2
the demise of the spare is already having an impact on emergency call - outs			2
@entity140 , the car breakdown service , said the number of call - outs to drivers stranded by flat tyres leapt 20 per cent last year			1
the @entity146 had 80,000 calls in 2011 from motorists who found they had n’t got a spare in the boot , and who were unable to use the sealant kits			1
that works out as around one fifth of all their tyre problem calls			2
@entity157 , an @entity146 patrol officer , is not a fan			1
‘ i ’ve never been very successful with them , ’ he says			0
‘ they are fine if it ’s a small hole caused by a nail			0
but the problem is that when you use the sealant it ends up on the road and it ’s messy			0
‘ it costs £ 20 to £ 30 to replace the sealant , and when you take the tyre to be repaired they wo n’t take it because of the glue inside			2
so you have to pay for a new tyre as well			2
‘ i had a call out this week from a middle - aged women who could n’t find the spare but thought there must be one			2
' when we opened up the boot the hole that should have been filled by a tyre was instead filled with a piece of polystyrene			0
she looked at me in disbelief			0
’ so why are car manufacturers cutting back on spares ? one reason is the demand for ever larger boots			1
families want people carriers with seven seats , plus room for buggies and luggage			0
something has to give , and that something is the spare tyre			1
removing the tyre which is usually stored under the boot ’s carpet gives more space for boot seats to be folded away when not in use			0
but above all , getting rid of the spare saves the manufacturers money			1
it is cheaper to fit a £ 20 repair kit than an £ 80 spare tyre			1
there is also the issue of @entity215 and @entity66 legislation designed to cut greenhouse gas emissions			0
the motor industry is under intense pressure to shave off excess weight from cars to improve fuel efficiency , and scrapping the spare removes up to 25kg of weight			0
while drivers fume , the car industry insists it is giving consumers more choice			0
@entity228 , of the @entity229 , says : ‘ some people are comfortable with changing a tyre , but there are other motorists who want the ease , speed and the safety of not having to change a tyre on the side of the road			1
and there are drivers who do n’t know how to change a tyre , or who do n’t want to			0
’ the manufacturers argue that if a customer lavishes £ 15,000 on a new car they would be pretty daft not to double - check what they were getting for their money			1
the @entity146 had some 80,000 calls from motorists who discovered that their car did n't have a spare tyre in 2011 ( file picture ) the trouble is , how many motorists would ever imagine they ’d be sold a new car without a spare tyre			1
some manufacturers allow you to ‘ upgrade ’ by paying extra for a spare , but in many models there simply is n’t space			1
the @entity146 — which wants spare tyres to be included as standard — says dealerships need to spell out more clearly what customers are getting			1
@entity146 technical director @entity270 says : ‘ not including a spare wheel has become a growing trend among car manufacturers over the past five years , to the point where about 50 per cent of punctures registered in 2012 happened to vehicles which did not have a spare wheel			1
’ there is no sign that spares are about to come back into fashion either			0
it wo n’t be many years before they are available only as a pricey optional extra — along with sun roofs and a sat - nav			0
that means for the foreseeable future , the only spare tyres middle - aged men like me will have in our cars are the ones around our waists .			0

breakdown *specialist* the @entity146 were called by 80,000 motorists last year who discovered they did n't have a spare
