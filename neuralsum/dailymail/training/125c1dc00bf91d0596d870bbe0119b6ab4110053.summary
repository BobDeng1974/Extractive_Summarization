by @entity1 reporter published : 10:24 est , 28 may 2012 updated : 19:53 est , 28 may 2012 this is the moment a daredevil photographer stared down death through his lens - as two @entity7 fighter jets swooped on the ship he was standing on			1
the snapper , who has never been named , somehow survived the @entity13 attack by two @entity14 on may 25 , 1982			1
the @entity15 had tasked its pair of prized pilots to take out @entity18 and @entity19 - the two @entity21 ships on duty to the northwest of the disputed archipelago			1
bravery : the snapper , who has never been named , somehow survived the @entity13 attack by two @entity14 on may 25 , 1982 captain @entity29 , in the left plane , and lieutenant @entity31 , right , skimmed just a few feet above the water to avoid radar detection			1
both pilots survived because the @entity36 missile system on @entity19 was unable to choose between their a- 4s when they became visible on the radar			2
the aircrafts released one bomb each			2
one missed the target , while the other one hit the @entity19 , in spite of the intense anti-aircraft fire			2
@entity51 flight , two a- 4s piloted by lt. @entity47 and @entity48 , armed with three lighter bombs , soon followed on			2
lt. @entity47 fired his cannons and then released his three bombs that hit and heavily damaged @entity18 , which sank within 20 minutes			1
nineteen lives were lost on board @entity18 when two of the three bombs exploded , but the other 280 crew members were saved			1
the air raid came during what was known to be a highly risky operation , with the two ships deployed to draw @entity7 bombers away from where @entity21 troops were landing at @entity65			0
sinking : @entity18 went down shortly after the first picture was taken among the survivors was the ship 's captain , @entity70 - father of the tv comedienne @entity71 - who managed to swim to a life raft			1
now 72 , he once described in the @entity1 the dread he felt when four @entity7 planes showed up on the radar - and the chaos that ensued after the 1,000lb bombs went off			0
he wrote : ' my world exploded			0
i was aware of a flash , of heat and the crackling of the radar set as it literally disintegrated in front of my face			0
when i came to my senses , i could see nothing through the dense black smoke , only people on fire , but i could sense that the compartment had been totally devastated			0
' mr @entity70 , who sustained facial injuries as flames ripped through the ship , has since released his account in a book entitled four weeks in may			0
last week he attended a memorial dinner to mark 30 years since the attack			0
