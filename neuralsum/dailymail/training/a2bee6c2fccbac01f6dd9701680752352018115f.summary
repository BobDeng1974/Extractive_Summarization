many of us , at some point , will have noticed a moment at home when the lights go dim for a split - second			1
we might , suspecting that our eyes are playing tricks , ask someone else whether they saw it , too			2
when they confirm that they have , we ’re grateful that we have n’t imagined things , and then get on with our evening			2
but imagine if the lights went dim and then stayed like that for several hours — or perhaps even several days			2
that would certainly be something to worry about			2
such events are called ‘ brown - outs ’ , because they are one step short of a full black - out			0
they occur when the voltage to a home or office — the amount of electrical energy being supplied — drops below its normal level			1
although brown - outs are a regular occurrence in the @entity33 , where electrical infrastructure is creaking , they are almost unheard of in this country			0
indeed , the term itself will be unfamiliar to many			0
however , this winter it is highly likely that we shall come to know the term all too well			0
brown - outs are set to become a frequent and unwelcome feature of our lives			0
although brown - outs may seem innocuous at first , they are in fact potentially extremely damaging to electronic equipment such as computers , set - top boxes , wireless routers and even many digital clocks found on household appliances such as ovens			1
what makes things more worrying is that the brown - outs , if they do happen , will be deliberately brought about by the @entity57			1
but why would it do something so damaging ? and what can we as consumers do to protect ourselves from the consequences ? the answer to the first question lies in the simple fact that @entity68 ’s power supplies are almost completely over-stretched			1
so much so that this week the energy secretary @entity69 — who has been forced to deny that blackouts are looming — will unveil a package of contingency measures to reduce pressures on the @entity57 this winter			1
they include paying hotels to turn down refrigerators , and paying companies to change shifts for staff to make the most efficient use of energy			1
this extraordinary situation — @entity68 once had the most reliable electricity supply in the world — is thanks to a medley of mishaps across @entity68 ’s power stations			1
the most recent was certainly dramatic			0
last weekend , there was a fire at the @entity95 gas - powered power station near @entity96			1
although the blaze could have been a lot worse — 25 fire engines fought the flames — it did succeed in destroying a unit that supplies power to half - a - million households			1
that is not something which can be quickly replaced			0
by itself , the fire at @entity108 would not have severely dented the nation ’s power supply , but there are already four other power stations out of action because of various fires and faults			1
together , the five stations that are closed would normally generate a massive 4.3 gigawatts of power , or 7 per cent of the @entity68 ’s total electricity capacity			1
in relative terms , that percentage may not seem that large , but that capacity does need to be found from somewhere else , especially as winter approaches			0
what ’s more , demand for electricity shot up this weekend , when the clocks went back to @entity129 , which means a greater demand for street lighting in the late afternoons			1
according to some experts , that means the @entity57 may well find it hard to cope , as it now has so little capacity in reserve			1
in summer , there is usually enough energy in reserve to cope with any problems , but in the winter , services are stretched to capacity			1
not easily replaced : fire crews spray water at the scene of a fire at @entity148 in oxfordshire.the blaze could have been but it did succeed in destroying a unit that supplies power to half - a - million households @entity153 , an industry expert , has said : ‘ we still have enough capacity to meet demand — provided that nothing else goes down and that we do n’t have a cold winter			1
so much depends on the weather			0
’ if this winter is , indeed , cold — and the long - range forecast suggests that december might be colder than average — then the @entity57 could be in trouble , especially if another one or two power stations suffer from mishaps			1
mr @entity153 says that normally he would put the odds of an event happening that threatens the security of supply at about one in 20			2
‘ a week ago i would have said one in four and now i ’d say one in three			0
’ if the @entity57 struggles to meet demand , then — as @entity69 will make clear — businesses are first obliged to cut down on their energy usage , by doing basic things such as turning off office lights at night , cutting back on air - conditioning use or running heavy - duty machinery only when necessary			1
in order to create an incentive , the government believes it will have to pay firms to reduce their demand			0
however , if @entity69 ’s plans are not enough , the @entity57 will be forced to reduce the amount of electrical power , or volts , going to our homes			1
this will result in brown - outs , which are considered to be far less disruptive than full black - outs			0
as a result , a reduced voltage entering into our homes may play havoc with many of our home technology appliances			1
the reasons for this are a little technical , but in layman ’s terms , many devices such as set - top boxes and computers , when faced with a diminution of power , will need to draw more current — the rate of flow of electricity , which is measured in amps — in order to compensate			2
drawing more current confuses the internal ‘ organs ’ of computerised devices , and can cause them not only to become less efficient and slower , but also to break down			0
with so many of us using and relying on such devices , it ’s clear that regular brown - outs could not only make our lives more miserable but also severely affect the country ’s economy			0
so how can we protect ourselves ? first , if you notice the lights getting dim , turn off and unplug all devices such as computers , set - top boxes , and appliances that have digital clocks			2
although tvs are built to be less sensitive to voltage changes , it is worth playing it safe and switching them off , too , to ensure they are not damaged			2
brown - outs can also damage mini-motors , such as those in fridges			0
although most are hardy enough to deal with very short brown - outs of , say , a few minutes , many might struggle over longer periods			0
if you can turn the appliance off , then consider doing so			0
however , if you can not bear to turn some devices off or need them because you are working from home , then you should invest in some form of generator			2
petrol generators can cost several hundred pounds , although a cheaper option would be to invest in a unit called an ‘ uninterruptible power supply ’ , which will protect devices such as computers and set - top boxes from a fluctuating voltage			1
such units are available from many retailers such as @entity259 , and they are essentially large batteries that ‘ kick in ’ when the unit senses that the voltage is diminishing , spiking , or cutting out altogether			2
some of the cheaper models cost around £ 80 , and will provide enough power to keep your computer running for around 15 minutes — plenty of time to save your data and anything you are working on			0
the more expensive models can cost many hundreds of pounds or more , but may be worth the investment if you do work from home			2
meanwhile , @entity69 is doing his best to ensure that we do not panic			0
a spokesman for his @entity275 declared : ‘ the lights will not go out this winter			0
‘ up and down the country there are power stations on stand - by that can start pumping out power when needed , and the government has given the @entity57 extra powers it needs to ensure there is enough electricity to keep the lights on			1
’ even if the lights do stay on , we may find them dimmed by a brown - out			0
of course , the lights may stay on , but they may go ‘ brown ’			0
if that does happen , then it is best to be prepared .			0
