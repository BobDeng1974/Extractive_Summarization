an orbiting factory that will build super-sized structures in space is being funded by @entity3			1
the multi-armed factory will use 3d printing and robotics to create giant space structures , such as antennas and solar arrays , that would otherwise have been impossible to launch from @entity11			1
a demonstration of the factory , dubbed @entity14 , could be ready by 2020 , after @entity16 - based technology firm @entity15 ( @entity17 ) was awarded a $ 500,000 contract to develop the factory			1
the @entity14 project is developing technologies to enable robotic spacecraft to fabricate giant antennas , solar arrays , and telescopes in space @entity14 uses 3d printing and robotics to enable space systems to build and put together large components such as antennas , solar arrays , sensor masts , and shrouds on orbit			1
currently , large spacecraft components are built on the ground , and are designed to fold up to fit within a rocket shroud and then deploy on orbit			0
but this approach is hugely expensive , and the size of these components is limited by the volume of available shrouds			0
‘ on orbit fabrication allows the material for these critical components to be launched in a very compact and durable form , such as spools of fibre or blocks of polymer , so they can fit into a smaller , less expensive launch vehicle , ’ said dr @entity42 , @entity17 ’s chief scientist			2
@entity53 will enable space systems to be launched in a compact and durable ' embryonic ' state			0
once in orbit , these systems will use techniques evolved from emerging additive manufacturing and automated assembly technologies to create huge space structures ‘ once on orbit , the @entity14 robotic fabrication systems will process the material to create extremely large structures that are optimised for the space environment			1
‘ this radically different approach to building space systems will enable us to create antennas and arrays that are tens to hundreds of times larger than are possible now , providing higher power , higher bandwidth , higher resolution , and higher sensitivity for a wide range of space missions			1
’ space factories would also significantly reduce the risk of launching delicate equipment on rockets , where the chance of failure is high			2
the funding follows an initial contract that was given earlier this year to test the viability of the technology			0
in the @entity90 effort , @entity17 will develop and demonstrate methods to enable additive manufacturing of high performance support structures such as reflectors and antennas			2
alongside this , @entity17 is working under a @entity3 @entity98 ( @entity98 ) contract to develop a ‘ @entity103 ’ device that will fabricate truss structures to enable in space construction of large solar arrays			1
the @entity103 device will fabricate truss structures to enable in space construction of large solar arrays ‘ the @entity103 is the key first step in implementing the @entity14 architecture , ’ said dr @entity42			1
‘ once we ’ve demonstrated that it works , we will be well on our way towards creating football field sized antennas and telescopes to help search for @entity11 like exoplanets and evidence of extraterrestrial life			2
’ the funding follows a string of projects by @entity3 to develop 3d printing in space			1
last month , the largest @entity124 printed rocket engine component @entity3 ever has tested blazed to life during an engine firing that generated a record 20,000 pounds of thrust			0
the component was manufactured using selective laser melting			0
this method built up layers of nickel - chromium alloy powder to make the complex , subscale injector with its 28 elements for channeling and mixing propellants			0
the part was similar in size to injectors that power small rocket engines			0
it was similar in design to injectors for large engines , such as the rs - 25 engine that will power @entity3 's @entity146 rocket for deep space human missions to an asteroid and @entity150			0
this test was a milestone for one of many important advances the agency is making to reduce the cost of space hardware .			0

@entity14 will build huge structures such as antennas and masts
@entity15 has received $ 500,000 to develop a demo factory by 2020
the group is also working on a ‘ @entity103 ’ device that will fabricate 3d printed structures in space for large solar arrays
