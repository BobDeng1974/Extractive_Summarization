it is one of @entity3 's most iconic venues , but @entity6 's @entity5 restaurant has been voted to have the ' most disappointing cooking ' in the 2015 edition of @entity11 's @entity10 guide			1
and @entity13 's much - loved @entity12 did n't fare much better , dubbed an ' overcrowded ' and ' impersonal place ' where ' uneventful ' dishes come at ' merciless prices '			1
while celebrity favourite @entity19 - frequented by @entity21 and @entity22 - may be an ' amazing ' room , the @entity18 survey found the food at @entity26 hotel where ' poseurs and paparazzi abound ' actually ' meh '			2

' it underlines @entity3 's continued emergence as the greatest restaurant city on the planet , but – in the 24 years in which we have tracked openings – such highpoints have also often heralded more competitive times ahead			1
' the guide collated scores from more than 65,000 reviews posted by over 6,000 ' ordinary diners ' to compile the rankings			2
