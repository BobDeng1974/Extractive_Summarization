@entity0 has sought to play down his spat with @entity2 by tweeting a conciliatory message with his compatriot on monday night			1
@entity0 and @entity2 had a 10 - minute row on saturday , after the world no 2 's wife ' heckled ' his opponent from the sidelines during their match			1
but the @entity12 stars , who will play together this weekend in the @entity14 final , appeared to have settled their differences just 48 hours after the dispute			1
@entity0 ( centre ) and @entity18 ( second right ) appeared to have settled their differences @entity2 trained in @entity19 ahead of the @entity14 final , where he will play alongside @entity0 the @entity12 no 2 sweeps the court after the session but the controversy has overshadowed his preparation @entity2 , arriving in @entity19 , will be key if @entity0 is to pick up the last title he has not yet earned in his career @entity2 ( left ) and @entity0 pose together before their @entity28 semi-final at the @entity30 @entity0 announced his withdrawal from the @entity28 on sunday after arguing with @entity2 @entity0 's wife @entity32 is alleged to have questioned whether @entity2 could beat her husband in the semis @entity2 was left unhappy after overhearing comments from @entity0 's wife @entity32 on saturday night @entity0 ( second left ) poses with his first @entity37 trophy in 2003 alongside then - girlfriend @entity32 ( right ) born in @entity39 , @entity40 in 1978 , @entity38 began her own tennis career at a young age and turned professional when she was 20			1
she won three @entity44 titles during her career and reached a highest ranking of no 76 in the world in september 2001 , but a persistent foot injury forced her to quit the game a year later			0
she met @entity0 at the @entity51 and married him in 2009			2
the couple have two sets of twins - identical twin girls @entity56 and @entity57 ( born july 23 , 2009 ) and twin boys @entity59 and @entity60 ( born may 6 , 2014 )			2
as well as looking after her children , @entity32 often follows her husband on tour and is said to be a major factor in the huge success he has experienced over the last 11 years			2
in an interview with @entity68 earlier this year , @entity0 said of his wife : ' i think every wife is important			2
she 's [ always ] been involved to some degree , but [ she was more ] involved , midway through our relationship			0
she came to every practice , every match , spent breakfast , lunch , and dinner together for years			0
' it 's still very intense today , but we have kids and she 's seen 900 matches , i guess			0
she 's ok missing one once in a while and not coming to practices any more			0
she 's been very important in my life , not just as a tennis player , but overall			0
' the pair are in @entity19 ahead of the team event against @entity93 which begins on friday , and could see @entity0 win the only major tennis trophy that has so far eluded him			2
@entity0 , who arrived in @entity93 on a private jet after pulling out of the @entity97 final on sunday , tweeted : ' it 's great being with the boys again , ' alongside a picture with @entity2 and the rest of his @entity12 team - mates			1
and the @entity103 2 tweeted the same picture just minutes later , in what looks like an attempt to smooth over the dispute			0
@entity0 won saturday 's match 4 - 6 , 7 - 5 , 7 - 6 at the @entity30 in @entity109 but his victory has been overshadowed by the fallout			1
it is understood that one of the reasons the @entity12 compatriots fell out was because @entity0 's wife @entity32 ' heckled ' @entity2			1
among @entity2 's complaints is that she made audible comments from his supporters ' box – which is at ground level – questioning in @entity93 whether he would have the guts to close the match			1
according to several eyewitnesses , a vociferous argument developed between the pair in the backstage area			2
tour officials decided that the best thing was to push them alone into a private room that had been converted into a gym area , as there is no communal locker room at the arena			0
while the dispute is not believed to have become physical , a heated 10 - minute row ensued in which both aired their grievances against the other			1
in what had been an unusually feisty and high quality semi-final , @entity2 had four match points and served for the match at 5 - 4			1
according to @entity93 television , @entity2 was picked up saying : ' she did the same thing at @entity37			0
' @entity32 and @entity0 , who first met in 2000 and married in 2009 , have two sets of twins together @entity2 ( left ) and @entity0 hug after their @entity28 semi-final at the @entity30 in @entity109 @entity152 spoke of the dispute between @entity2 and @entity0 on @entity155 television @entity0 , pictured during his semi-final win against @entity2 , cited a back injury as his reason for pulling out @entity0 and @entity159 , pictured at @entity160 in january 2006 , met at the @entity51 next up for @entity12 duo @entity0 and @entity2 is the @entity14 final against @entity93			1
the three - day team event , which begins on friday , could see the pair joining forces in a doubles match at the @entity167 in @entity19			0
@entity168 and @entity169 are the other members of the @entity12 team			0
@entity152 spoke of the dispute on @entity155 television , but he seemed unaware of the extent to which it has escalated , according to those @entity177 has spoken to			0
another cause of tension in matches between the two is said to be the presence in @entity0 's box of @entity12 @entity14 captain @entity184 , who coaches the world no 2 along with @entity186			1
although doing his best to stay impartial in these encounters , it is not hard to see why @entity2 might resent his team competition captain siding with his rival when it comes to their head - to - head combat			2
ultimately the @entity103 2 was unable to finish the job off and was denied a place in the final of the prestigious year - end championships , with well - placed sources saying he was furious at the intervention of mrs @entity38			0
while the undoubted row between the two men is a distraction , it was not the main cause of @entity0 pulling out of sunday night 's final , although the tension it caused is unlikely to have helped			1
the @entity12 master , drained by the physically and mentally exhausting match against @entity2 , sustained a pull in his back and clearly did not wish to risk it ahead of the @entity14 final			1
@entity0 usually manages to avoid controversy and his wife says little in public , despite playing a major role in her 33 year - old husband 's phenomenal career			1
@entity38 was a tennis player herself but she now supports her husband 's career and follows him on tour @entity0 , pictured with @entity159 at the @entity224 , says his wife has seen over 900 matches @entity159 watches her husband in action at @entity37 in 2012 with twin daughters @entity56 and @entity57 those who know her speak of someone quietly formidable and determined who behind the scenes helps organise the incredibly busy life of her spouse , with whom she now has two sets of twins			2
a former player herself , when she was known as @entity38 , she reached a career - high singles ranking of 76 and met the soon - to - be superstar at the @entity51			0
however , she had to retire from the sport with a persistent foot injury and has since channelled her energies into helping her husband become the global icon that he now is			0
aside from maintaining his fitness and training regime and having four young children , @entity0 also has a large portfolio of sponsorships and has his own personal charitable foundation that he attends to			0
@entity32 , who married him in 2009 , is said to be a key component in making his life run like a @entity12 clock to keep the success going			2
she is also known to have steely side , and it seems that is what has led to the fallout with @entity2 that could be a threat to @entity12 's @entity14 dreams			1
