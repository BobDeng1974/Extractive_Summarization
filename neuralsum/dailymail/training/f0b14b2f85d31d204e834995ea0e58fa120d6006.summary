by @entity0 published : 19:11 est , 12 march 2014 updated : 19:14 est , 12 march 2014 no vote : @entity3 says @entity4 will only hold an @entity6 referendum if @entity7 is asked to hand over more power to @entity9 @entity3 faced an onslaught from both @entity11 and @entity12 last night after effectively ruling out an @entity6 referendum if he becomes prime minister			1
the @entity4 leader ended a year of dithering over the issue by announcing that he will refuse to match prime minister @entity19 ’s pledge to hold an ‘ in / out ’ vote by 2017			1
he said @entity4 would only offer people a say in the event of a new @entity6 treaty in which @entity7 is asked to hand over more powers to @entity9 , something even he admitted was ‘ unlikely ’ to happen			1
mr @entity3 ’s stance brings @entity4 policy into line with that of the @entity30 , prompting speculation he is preparing the ground for a potential coalition deal if he fails to win a majority in next year ’s general election			1
tories expressed delight , saying they could now tell voters only they were prepared to offer the public their first say on @entity6 membership for 40 years in the next @entity42			1
they also said it should now be obvious to @entity46 voters that backing @entity49 risks letting in a @entity4 government which will not hold a referendum			2
a recent @entity53 poll found 62 per cent of @entity54 wanted a referendum , against 21 per cent who did not			2
among @entity4 voters , the figures were 49 per cent and 33 per cent			0
mr @entity19 said : ‘ the @entity54 people now have a very , very clear choice			0
they can elect a @entity11 government that will renegotiate @entity54 ’s position in @entity63 and give people a guaranteed in / out referendum by the end of 2017			2
if they get a @entity4 government they get no referendum , no choice , nothing			0
’ @entity71 agitating for the party to back a vote attacked what one called a ‘ shoddy compromise ’			0
meanwhile one of the party ’s biggest donors , @entity76 , who is also chairman of the @entity80 campaign , said : ‘ i want to see a @entity4 government in 2015 and , as the party that trusts the people , i think we should recognise that the growth of the @entity6 ’s influence over @entity54 in the past 40 years warrants a referendum			1
’ @entity4 mp @entity87 said : ‘ it ’s a shoddy compromise , between those in the @entity90 who want a referendum because the vast majority of the electorate want it , and those desperate not to have a referendum			0
’ labour sources claimed mr @entity3 had overruled senior figures including shadow chancellor @entity99 , police chief @entity100 and former shadow cabinet minister @entity101			2
former labour minister @entity104 , a @entity46 , said : ‘ i think it ’s meant to be a clever compromise , i do n’t think it ’s going to end up as one			0
’ mr @entity3 acknowledged concerns about the @entity6 and said he would seek to return ‘ more control to national parliaments ’			1
his announcement divided business groups , with the @entity112 praising him for giving businesses certainty over @entity54 ’s future in the @entity6 but the @entity116 insisting a referendum must be held			1
@entity118 , the former @entity4 business secretary , said : ‘ i think it will be seen as quite a game - changer for @entity3			2
he ’s shown judgment , and courage			0
’ former foreign secretary @entity123 said : ‘ this offers reassurance not only to business and millions of workers whose jobs depend on @entity63 but also allays the fears of those who are uncomfortable with moves towards ever closer union			0
’ but the chairman of the all - party parliamentary group for an @entity6 referendum , @entity136 , said : ‘ @entity4 has come up short			1
the leadership has all but said there will never be an in / out referendum on their watch			0
only the @entity11 will be able to deliver such a referendum			0

@entity3 has effectively ruled out an @entity6 referendum if he wins election
will only hold vote if @entity7 is asked to give more power to @entity9
