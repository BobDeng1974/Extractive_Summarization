the controversial range of curtains and cushions featured an original watercolour design , pictured unfortunately for @entity13 , the flower image altered slightly in the manufacturing process with amusing results @entity29 said : ' how do you manage to make private parts when they 're supposed to be flowers ? ' @entity29 from @entity33 told the @entity34 : ' after taking a close look at the curtains my mum had bought , i could n’t help noticing they seemed to include pictures of , well , men ’s genitalia			1
i ca n’t believe no - one at @entity13 is aware of this			1
how do you manage to make private parts when they ’re supposed to be flowers ? ” a spokesperson for @entity13 admitted the company had made a mistake and would withdraw the range from sale			1
' thank you for drawing attention to this			0
' the design was based on an original watercolour painting and unfortunately the way the watercolour paint has dried has given the illusion of something that was not intended , we are not continuing with this design on any products			1
' in july , the company was forced to apologise to the parents of twin girls @entity63 and @entity64 after their father @entity65 , 23 , spotted the image of a penis on his daughters ' baby grow			1
mr @entity70 saw the penis image on the clothes as they were hanging on the washing line			2
his wife @entity75 , 24 , said : ' he was feeding my daughter when he suddenly said " oh my god " , ' said the insurance worker			0
' he looked at the baby grow and noticed the trousers were covered in penises			0
@entity83 took a photograph of the ' offending image ' which he claims does not look like a flower ' at first i thought it must just be a mistake , but i looked and there are lots of different ones all over it			2
' it just looks like the designer was having a laugh and no one spotted it			2
i was angry because it 's not the kind of thing you should be dressing a baby in			0
' next , which stocks hundreds of baby clothes , later admitted the drawing of a jumper had ended up looking like a penis because of a misprint			2
mr and mrs @entity64 had been given a packet of the baby grows as a present four months ago , but had only recently noticed the design flaw			2
in july , @entity13 was forced to apologise after this baby grow was spotted featuring a small penis in the design they are now refusing to dress their twin daughters in them			1
' we are n't going to keep it and keep dressing the girls in it , ' said mrs @entity64			2
' i think what makes it all worse is that i have dressed two girls in it , not just that i put it on a baby			0
' the girls were wearing it for weeks before we noticed			0
we do n't tend to look in depth at the clothes			0
' we just thought it was a cute , nice baby grow with washing line with clothes and socks on it , but then we saw this			0
once you notice it , it is unmistakeable			0
' a spokesman for @entity13 said the offending design was pulled from shelves after they received another complaint about the item			1
in a statement , the store said : ' we were shocked by the image that ended up on one of our sleepsuits			0
' the offending part of the design started life as an upside down jumper with a neck binding and placket with buttons ( hanging on the washing line ) , but unfortunately has been over simplified by the printer and has unintentionally become something else			0
' this is an innocent mistake that had not been picked up in the approval process			0
as it was inappropriate we made the decision to withdraw this item from sale as soon as it was bought to our attention earlier this year			1
