@entity7 finished sixth on his @entity2 debut in 2004 and actually led in 2007 after five holes of the final round it ’s a stupid rule that has subsequently been changed and @entity7 said , smiling : ’ it would be nice to wind the clock back , would n’t it ? it did affect me for a few holes and i fell away ( he finished 10th )			1
