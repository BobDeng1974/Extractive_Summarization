@entity0 admits @entity1 do not have the look of @entity4 title contenders despite spending more than £ 150million on new players this summer			1
@entity7 's first task after taking over at @entity8 was to guide @entity1 back into the @entity9 and his team occupied fourth place for the duration of the international break			1
the @entity14 completes a relatively kind introduction to life in @entity18 football with a trip to @entity20 , but that is followed by games against @entity23 and @entity24			1
video : scroll down for @entity7 views on @entity1 's struggles in the final half hour of games @entity1 boss @entity0 has had some mixed results at @entity8 so far this season although @entity31 could return at @entity32 with the help of a corset to protect his broken rib , the @entity30 is the only one of nine injured players expected to feature			1
asked if @entity1 would be contenders with a fully - fit squad that now includes @entity39 and @entity40 , @entity7 replied : ' you have your hopes but i do think there are stronger teams in the world now			1
' we have to make a team and that 's why i have a period of three years			1
i hope we can fulfil the dream we have			2
@entity23 has already a lot of time			2
' when you have three months with 10 players injured you can not have a big progression			2
you are always playing with a different team			2
' i do n't think that 11 points out of seven games is better than i expected			0
i think it is good enough to be in fourth place and nothing more			1
' @entity7 broke the bank to bring international stars @entity40 ( left ) and @entity39 to @entity8 @entity7 believes he can draw on his bittersweet experience as @entity66 coach to turn @entity1 into challengers again			1
after his first back - to - back wins in the @entity4 , it perhaps seems odd that the 63 - year - old should be discussing turning points but @entity7 did not enjoy watching @entity1 hang on for successive 2 - 1 wins over @entity74 and @entity75 at @entity8			1
he is demanding a significant improvement			2
@entity7 sees similarities with his brief reign at @entity66 five years ago when he struggled to impose his philosophy on the players , risking the sack as the club suffered their worst start in 15 years while he tinkered with the line - up and tactics			1
@entity86 ( left ) , @entity87 and @entity88 are all smiles at @entity1 's training base in @entity91 @entity7 received a major boost this week when @entity93 ( left ) and @entity94 returned to training @entity7 signed @entity14 star @entity96 from @entity97 for £ 14million during the summer his plans came together in an emphatic @entity9 win over @entity100 in @entity101 which saved his job and kick - started the club 's season			1
@entity66 went on to win a league and cup double , although they lost to @entity108 's @entity107 in the @entity9 final			1
' do you remember when we had our revival ? ' said @entity7 , who asked for three months before he was judged at @entity1			1
' we won 4 - 1 at @entity100 , a fantastic game , and that gave us that psychological benefit			0
' that was the end of november			0
there is still a month to go			0
but then it will be four months — i 'm sorry			0
it was very stupid to say three months because you are only talking about three months			0
' it is the performance that counts			0
always the performance goes up and down			0
when that date or match is ( that gives us a lift ) , is dependable			0
' @entity7 is concerned @entity1 flagged in the last half - hour against @entity74 and @entity75			1
indeed , a club renowned for late goals are yet to score after the 63rd minute all season			0
he added : ' it 's the game , it 's the style , it 's the formation , it 's the philosophy that we have to judge and not the points because the points are coming			2
against @entity75 we could not say it was very good			2
the first hour maybe , but a game lasts 90 minutes			0
' fitness is maybe a point because i have said that i have adapted my intensity of training sessions to a lower level			0
but i think we are fit enough because what i see of my players they are fighting to the last minute			0
they are willing to do everything , so i 'm very happy with their passion			0
' we have to learn to kill the game and you can not do that with one or three or eight players			0
we have to do it with 11 players and all of them have to think the same otherwise you lose balls unnecessarily and then are going back instead of forward			0
that 's what we have to do but that takes time			2
