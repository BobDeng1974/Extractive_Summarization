major @entity0 , 40,described how he felt ashamed at how defended kit and training he knew to be inadequate on reports on the war for the @entity24 , sticking to lines given by the @entity12 the former army commander was a senior officer in the @entity28 insurgent stronghold , who commanded @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 , during a seven - month tour , which saw some of the fiercest fighting in the war			1
according to the @entity39 , the problems with equipment and training was a major factor in the death of lance corporal @entity5 in the winter of 2009 - 2010 in @entity28 , where he was killed when a @entity45 sniper mistook him for a @entity47 fighter			1
@entity0 said 22 - year - old 's ' blue on blue ' death was indicative of the of the problems the @entity45 army faced in in fighting the @entity47 , and he called on the @entity12 to give @entity5 's family an apology			2
' in an interview with the @entity57 , @entity55 said : ' it 's true to say we were the best trained we 'd ever been , and we did have the best equipment we 'd ever had			2
' but it is also true to say it was n't good enough in relation to the operation we were going on and the tasks we were being asked to do			0
@entity5 in @entity18 , the young soldier who was accidentally shot dead by a comrade while on active service by a sniper who thought he was a @entity47 fighter			0

hindsight suggests we were far from being the finished article			0
' lance corporal @entity78 22 , of the @entity79 , @entity80 , who was killed as a result of small arms fire in @entity18 @entity0 criticised the way the @entity12 decided to buy their kit at short notice because they did not have it ready when they began conflict in @entity18			0
following his command in @entity18 , @entity0 took a position in @entity90 as an @entity12 procurement officer , where he noticed defence budget cuts add to the army 's existing problems			0
he said he was frustrated by the cuts , and that they procured the minimum level every time , but could not say anything externally because he was still in the army			0
when he brought it up internally , he was largely ignored , and instead would have to publicly defend the kit provided during training and on operations commanding @entity45 troops in the @entity105			1
during his time as a commander in the @entity45 army , he lost five men in the tour of the @entity105 , and blamed , in part , poor communication due to a lack of radios			1
according to @entity39 , the army gave misleading evidence in an inquest into the death of @entity5 , by saying that they were going to buy battlefield beacons , which would have saved his live			1
@entity0 said that it was important to recognise that while the army might have intended to buy the battlefield beacons , the money was simply not there to buy it			0

among @entity0 's revelations into the problems facing the army was that they lacked proper equipment for the field of battle , a claim that the @entity12 rejects she believes that her son 's death was not only completely preventable , it was caused through complete incompetence , in both leadership and equipment			1
the @entity12 responded to the circumstances that led to @entity5 's death , saying they were constantly reviewing equipment requirements , and since 2003 the @entity156 process , which buys emergency new equipment for the army , has delivered more than Â£ 5.8 billion worth of equipment to the front line , which has saved countless lives			1
they also claimed that no soldier is sent to the theatre of war without necessary training			2
@entity12 did n't to upgrade essential parts of the army 's core kit despite pledging billions of pounds to pay for the @entity169 's two new aircraft carriers and @entity171 jets for the @entity172			0
the @entity12 took too much time deliberating about spending money on beacons that allow commanders to identify their own troops on the battlefield , tech that could have prevented @entity5 's ' blue on blue ' death			2
