the way is finally clear for @entity1 and @entity2 to stage the @entity3 after nothing emerged from @entity6 ’s corruption report that could force a re-vote			2
@entity8 agreed unanimously at their summit here for the @entity6 findings , where legally possible , to be published in full — but only after being assured there is no explosive detail within the 430 pages that would require another @entity16 election			1
@entity6 had sent hapless @entity8 into meltdown — first by disowning ethics committee colleague @entity18 ’s summary of his report and then resigning his @entity8 role on the eve of the executive committee ’s meeting in @entity25			1
this was after @entity8 ’s appeals committee turned down his @entity18 complaint			1
after the meeting he echoed the famous quote attributed to former @entity41 pm @entity40 : ‘ @entity42 ? ’ @entity29 said : ‘ we have been in crisis — the crisis has stopped			1
there will be no revote , the decision has been taken			2
i managed to get the executive to back publication under certain conditions			0
the most important thing is to share the will of the president and for the executive to move forward			0
’ however it will be some time before a heavily redacted @entity6 report does see the light of day , when the lawyers have had their say and all those who spoke to @entity6 under privacy agreements have been protected			2
and the eventual published report is likely to be a damp squib , soft on @entity1 and @entity2 transgressions , while focusing on individual ethics codes violations			2
@entity73 ’s doomed 2018 bid is likely to remain in the firing line as it was in @entity18 ’s disputed summary of @entity6 ’s work			0
@entity8 president @entity29 speaks during the press conference in @entity79 , @entity25 , on friday @entity8 chairman @entity29 ( centre ) was in favour of @entity6 's report being published previously @entity8 will also wait until the personal investigations ordered by @entity6 are completed before publishing			1
the investigations into five individuals suspected of breaching the code will now be carried out by @entity6 ’s successor as @entity8 ethics investigator , @entity89			1
those under the microscope are @entity93 football great and former @entity8 executive member @entity94 , three current members of the @entity8 executive ; @entity98 ’s @entity97 , @entity100 ’s @entity99 and @entity101 of @entity102 , as well as @entity104 @entity103 , who led the delegation assessing the 2018 and 2022 bids			1
only six of the 25 - strong executive had been expected to support @entity6 ’s publication before they convened in the ballroom of @entity112 hotel in @entity79 — once a favourite of sir @entity114			1
so @entity29 — as he demonstrated afterwards — was overjoyed to sway the doubters not to oppose the transparency			1
even the three still being probed by @entity8 , who have the most to lose , agreed not to rock the boat			1
@entity8 chairman @entity29 ( centre ) was overjoyed to sway the doubters not to oppose the transparency @entity29 announces that @entity2 will be hosting the @entity123 , which caused plenty of controversy @entity29 said : ‘ what do you do to convince people ? to convince people is to say what is so important — that we are the guardians of the @entity8 statutes and regulations			1
there comes a situation where there must be unity and a determination to end a situation that has created a lot of problems			0
‘ it ’s not the first time that i have found myself as president of @entity8 in a critical situation			2
when something is wrong , we fight and i had big fighters today on the executive			0
’ @entity93 ’s @entity150 was the most vocal at the meeting in favour of publication			0
but , as it turned out , there was no need for a vote or for his motion to be debated			0
the executive were happy to rely on the recommendation of compliance chief @entity161 , who considered there was nothing big enough in it to take the @entity3 away from @entity1 and @entity2			0
@entity161 , before he came to that verdict , had taken legal advice from @entity168 professor @entity167 , from @entity170 and @entity93 professor in sport at @entity172 , @entity169 , who are now the seventh and eighth people to have seen the full @entity6 findings			0
only six of the 25 - strong executive had been expected to support @entity6 ’s publication before they convened @entity161 considered there was nothing big enough to take the @entity3 away from @entity1 or @entity2 @entity161 would not estimate how many of those 430 pages would survive the redaction process , but did say : ‘ there is nothing in the report that says a re-vote is needed			1
’ he did recommend that @entity8 should never again vote for two @entity16 stagings at the same time , and suggested rules should be tightened regarding gift protocol , as well as friendly match procedures and the roles of bid consultants			1
he also said promotion of football development projects outside the bid country should be stopped , there should be official audits of bids and there must be a legal obligation to store documents			0
@entity200 said their leased bid computers had been returned and all information destroyed , when @entity6 came knocking during the investigation process			0
meanwhile , the investigation into the five individuals will be fast - tracked according to @entity29 , to avoid a repeat of the length and cost of @entity6 ’s investigation			1
the @entity211 ’s two - year study involved round - the - world travel at a reported cost of $ 6million , before culminating with @entity8 ’s controversial report			1
july 2012 @entity8 appoint @entity211 lawyer @entity6 and @entity93 judge @entity18 to their @entity215			2
@entity6 is brought in to investigate bidding for the 2018 and 2022 @entity3			0
september 2014 @entity6 submits his 350 - page report			2
@entity18 says it will not be made public , with only his summary published			0
october 2014 @entity6 , among others , calls for the report to be published in full and says of @entity8 : ‘ ( the ) investigation and adjudication process operates in most parts unseen and unheard ... ( it ) might be appropriate for an intelligence agency but not for an ethics compliance process in an international sports institution			1
’ november 2014 @entity18 publishes his summary , which clears @entity1 and @entity2 of corruption , but claims @entity73 had undermined the integrity of bidding during their 2018 bid campaign			0
@entity6 says the findings contain ‘ erroneous representations ’ , and says he will appeal			0
december 2014 @entity8 dismiss @entity6 ’s complaint to their @entity236			2
@entity6 resigns from the @entity215 .			0

@entity8 were *due* to vote on friday *morning* on whether to publish the report
no vote was needed as @entity29 being in favour swayed the decision
only six of the 25 - strong committee were expected to be in favour
