for centuries mermaids have occupied the world of fantasy and fairy tale			1
this illustration was published in @entity5 around 1900 for thousands of years they have occupied the world of fantasy , fairy tale and folklore			1
the half - human , half - fish creatures first appeared in ancient @entity12 , now @entity13 , when the goddess @entity14 transformed herself into a mermaid out of shame , having accidentally killed her human lover			1
in history the seductive creatures have been linked to perilous events in @entity22 , @entity23 and @entity24 culture , including floods , storms , shipwrecks and drownings			0
and they are associated with @entity32 mythology , @entity29 having referred to them as sirens - dangerous , yet beautiful creatures , who lured sailors to shipwreck			2
@entity40 's well - known fairy tale @entity41 , was transformed into a @entity43 classic and mermaids have also been depicted in operas , paintings , books , films and comics			1
but could the concept actually have been derived from a real medical condition ? @entity52 , also known as ' mermaid syndrome ' is a life - threatening illness , marked by the rotation and fusion of a sufferer 's legs			1
the rare congenital deformity causes what looks like a single limb , resembling a fish tail , in the womb			1
medical historian @entity64 , who has a phd from @entity66 , told @entity67 the condition occurs from a failure of the normal vascular supply , when the umbilical cord fails to form two arteries			1
as a result there is not sufficient blood supply reaching the foetus , she said			1
the single artery ' steals ' the blood and nutrition from the lower body , diverting it back up into the placenta			1
suffering malnutrition , the foetus fails to develop two separate limbs			2
the condition is extremely rare , affecting one in 100,000 babies , but is 100 times more likely to occur in identical twins			1
babies born with the condition rarely live beyond a few days with more than half of cases resulting in stillbirth			1
dr @entity64 , author of the blog @entity95 's @entity94 , said : ' over the course of my research , i 've found very little about the disorder 's history			1
' there are snippets here and there which claim that foetuses born with sirenomelia were sometimes preserved in jars and put on display in ' freak shows ' during the 19th century			2
' but these sources are frustratingly vague			0
' there is a brief mention of the condition in a four - volume atlas published in 1891 titled @entity114 , but nothing that hints at how medical practitioners understood sirenomelia in earlier periods			1
' perhaps because the disorder is so rare , it 's also been hard for me to locate specimens in anatomical collections			2
' my search in the @entity124 at the @entity125 in @entity126 came up cold			0
but medical historian @entity64 said the inspiration for the mythical creature could come from a real medical condition			1
@entity52 also known as ' @entity52 ' is a fatal illness , marked by the rotation and fusion of a sufferer 's legs			1
pictured are specimens on display at the @entity137 in @entity138 @entity43 transformed @entity140 fairy tale into one of the most iconic animated films , @entity41 , released in 1989 a statue of @entity144 's the @entity145 in @entity146 , @entity147 , and right an illustration from @entity5 , right ' i did , however , find an early 20th - century example at the @entity150 in @entity151 ' there are also three foetuses in the @entity154 of the @entity155 , which have undergone @entity157 bone reconstructions			2
' but dr @entity64 said by far the largest collection of foetuses is to be found in @entity138 at the @entity137			2
another of the sirenomelia exhibits at the @entity137 in @entity138 , which has a vast collection of more than 5,000 human and animal anatomy they stand in jars among more than 5,000 specimens of human and animal anatomy , embryology , pathology and congenital anomalies			0
dr @entity64 added : ' @entity52 is extremely fatal			1
' there are no accounts of anyone with this condition surviving in the past			0
' @entity176 died within days of being born due to kidney and bladder failure			2
' even today , the odds are against those with sirenomelia , though there are a handful of examples of children living past infancy			0
' in 1988 @entity52 underwent surgery to separate her legs before her first birthday			1
she still suffers some mobility problems , because of her fragile bones , and uses crutches and a wheelchair to get around			0
at the age of 26 , she is the oldest known surviving sufferer of the condition			0
another notable survivor of the rare disorder is a @entity198 girl , nicknamed the @entity41			2
in 2006 a team of eight specialists successfully carried out a second operation on the then two - year - old @entity202			0
the youngster , whose first name means ' miracles ' in @entity206 , was born with the rare congenital disorder			1
her legs were fused from groin to ankles and her feet splayed , in the characteristic form of sirenomelia			2
most of @entity214 's internal organs , including her heart and lungs , were in perfect condition			0
but she was born with serious internal defects , including a deformed left kidney and a very small right kidney located very low in her body			0
her digestive , urinary tracts and genitals also shared a single tube			0
@entity198 @entity202 , known as the @entity41 , was operated on in 2006			0
surgeons completed a second operation to separate her legs , fused together after she was born with sirenomelia in june 2005 doctors successfully performed the first in a series of risky operations to separate @entity214 's lower legs , to above her knees			2
the second operation was carried out to separate the remaining fused tissue , from her knees to groin			0
@entity240 , who led the specialists , said after the second surgery : ' there were no problems , no complications from anaesthesia or from haemorraghing			0
' he said @entity248 had developed the ability to stand alone without help and take small assisted steps			0
in 2012 the then seven - year - old required a kidney transplant , part of surgery to reconstruct her urinary tract			0
@entity240 said at the time that @entity257 , was the only other person known to have undergone successful surgery to correct the rare congenital defect			0
in 2006 the surgeon calculated @entity214 would need at least 16 more operations over the course of the next decade to reconstruct and repair her digestive , urinary and sexual organs .			0
