by @entity0 published : 14:58 est , 16 june 2013 updated : 01:51 est , 17 june 2013 amateur film - makers will soon be able to give footage an age rating when posting it on @entity4			1
a project - which will have three traffic light classifications of green , amber and red - is aiming to cut down on the amount of harmful and inappropriate content that can be seen by children online			1
when amateur film - makers post clips online , they will be able to give them ratings corresponding to @entity18 levels - grouped into the three sets of @entity21 / @entity20 , 12/15 and @entity22			1
protecting children : videos such as this one filmed during the @entity25 riots of 2011 may be subject to an ' amber ' rating because they could be distressing for younger viewers dangerous : videos of extreme sportsmen or stunt artists suffering harm could be given red ratings , comparable to the 18 certificate received by the @entity37 @entity36 series video websites - not restricted to @entity4 - would also be able to allow viewers to comment on how films were rated , which could alert users and national authorities to any serious mistakes			1
the idea of a do - it - yourself rating system for uploaded videos was formed though discussions between the @entity18 and classification bodies in @entity50 and the @entity51 , reported @entity52			1
‘ this is a service we want to offer , ’ @entity18 policy spokesman @entity53 told the newspaper			2
‘ we already classify some 10,000 videos and films that are submitted to us for release every year			2
‘ we will be using much the same classification model in the pilot for user - generated content			0
’ the extraordinary number of videos uploaded to @entity4 and other video sharing websites every day has made it impossible for any regulatory board to watch all the footage themselves			0
no problems : innocent videos on @entity4 , such as the famous ' @entity72 bit my finger - again ' from 2007 , would most likely be given a green ( @entity74 or @entity20 ) rating by the person uploading them but the idea for an online questionnaire about the content uploaded by an amateur producer was formed after conversations with the @entity51 film regulator , reported @entity52			1
the @entity18 said that the questionnaire results will mean ‘ different things in different countries ’ - such as users in the @entity51 not worrying so much about bad language , compared to the @entity89			2
it is expected that the system will be tested from this summer			0
access that children can get to inappropriate online content is a concern for many parents			0
the @entity96 is campaigning for internet providers to automatically block access to porn , with an optional opt - in , rather than parents having to rely on software to limit access			0
last week research revealed one in four children who try to get around parental controls on internet use are looking for pornography .			0
