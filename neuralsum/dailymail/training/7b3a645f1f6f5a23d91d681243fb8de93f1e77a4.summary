islamic militants have fired rockets from speedboats at @entity4 's largest port in an attempt to seize control of the fiercely contested resource amid warnings the country is descending into chaos like that in @entity12			1
last night a rocket set three storage tanks ablaze at the eastern @entity4 oil port of @entity16 as armed factions allied to competing governments fought over control of the country 's biggest export terminal			1
rebels from a group called @entity24 , which helped to topple @entity25 in 2011 , seized control of the capital @entity28 in august - exiling the internationally recognised government east			2
the tank was struck after militants tried to seize control of the port in a speedboat attack firefighters try to contain parts of the fire after the intense blaze spread to two other storage tanks the group , which is responsible for the attack which left the tanks ablaze , are now engaged in a bitter power struggle with the incumbent government fought primarily over the country 's resources			1
@entity58 , spokesman for a security service allied to the country 's east - based internationally - recognised government , said the rival force tried taking the @entity16 with speedboats , opening fire on an oil tank			1
@entity66 , a spokesman for the rival force , said it had launched a new push to take the ports but denied it had sent boats or shot at any storage tanks			0
he blamed the other side , saying aircraft had attacked the tank			0
' a tank was hit but the damage is limited , ' @entity58 said , adding that the advance had been stopped with aircraft and ground troops			0
clashes were also reported from @entity84 , a city west of @entity16 , killing up to 19 , among them 14 guards at a power plant , residents said			2
meanwhile @entity4 , torn by the growing political divide that threatens to engulf its oilfields , could become the next @entity12 if it does not patch its divided government and get help battling @entity93 militants , the country 's foreign minister said this week			1
a @entity4 soldier looks at the body bag of a fellow soldier killed during clashes with militant forces in @entity99 doctors , nurses and other emergency services personnel tend to an injured @entity4 soldier ' if we do n't do the right thing now , in two years ' time we could have - hopefully not - a repeat of what happened in @entity12 in 2014 because the international community did n't react adequately , ' foreign minister @entity104 said			1
in an ominous turn of events , a force allied to the self - declared @entity114 government earlier this month moved to seize @entity4 's two biggest oil export ports , @entity116 and @entity117			1
fighting has since spread to a third oil port			1
@entity104 repeated his government 's charge that forces attacking the oil facilities included elements of @entity125 - a group the @entity126 has designated as terrorists suspected of being involved in the deadly september 2012 attack on the @entity126 diplomatic compound in @entity99			0
the fighting has reduced @entity4 's crude output to 352,000 barrels a day , a spokesman for state @entity131 said , adding that only the @entity135 , @entity136 , @entity137 and offshore operations were still producing			2
@entity116 and @entity117 ports - now closed due to the conflict - had previously been processing an estimated 300,000 barrels per day			0
commanders of armed groups operating in @entity4 have been warned they could face prosecution for possible war crimes including execution and torture			2
the @entity148 claims hundreds of civilians have been killed in fighting since late august , when @entity4 @entity24 seized control of the capital @entity28			1
the @entity154 country is struggling with fighting on several fronts as brigades of former rebels who battled side by side to oust @entity25 in 2011 now clash for political power and a share of oil revenues			2
the conflict has driven at least 120,000 people from their homes and caused a humanitarian crisis , said a joint report by the @entity148 human rights office and @entity169 in @entity4 that also documents shelling of civilian areas			0
the toll includes an estimated 100 people killed and 500 wounded in fighting between rival armed groups in @entity175 , an area near @entity28 ' perceived to be harbouring many @entity25 supporters as well as common criminals ' , between late august and early october			0
a further 170 were killed and hundreds injured in fighting in the @entity181 mountains to the southwest , it said			0
some 450 people have been killed in @entity99 since fighting escalated in mid-october			0
