in the week that @entity2 is celebrating the 45th anniversary of the first moon landing , one @entity1 artist has taken on a pioneering space endeavour of his own by sending plant life to the edge of space			1
@entity9 , a 38 - year - old from @entity10 , sent a bonsai tree and a flower arrangement into the upper atmosphere to witness what would happen			1
the results are a stunning cascade of colour and beauty as the plant life soars towards the cosmos , before the inevitable pop of the helium balloons that took them there brings them crashing back to @entity26			1
beginning in 2016 , the @entity35 - based company will take paying customers in a pressurised capsule to a height of 19 miles ( 30 kilometres )			2
in 2016 the parafoil , together with a high - altitude balloon , will be used to take pressurised capsules known as ‘ voyagers ’ on trips to the edge of space			2
this will give six passengers two hours of ' cruising ' during which they will be free to stroll around the ‘ luxury ’ capsule - which even has a bar and internet access			0
@entity53 launched the two botanical objects from the @entity55 in @entity56 on 15 july 2014 , reports the @entity57			0
‘ flowers are n’t just beautiful to show on tables , ’ he said			0
‘ i wanted to see the movement and beauty of plants and flowers suspended in space			0
’ with the help of his 10 - person crew and @entity68 ’s @entity67 , @entity53 set about designing the structures and setting up the cameras that would make the mission called @entity72 a success			1
two separate balloons were used to take the bouquet and bonsai tree into the upper atmosphere			1
the first , carrying the bonsai , rose to a height of 91,800ft ( 28,000 metres ) in 100 minutes before the helium balloon burst			2
@entity53 launched the two botanical objects , including a flower arrangement ( shown ) , from the @entity55 in @entity56 on 15 july 2014 with the help of his 10 - person crew and @entity68 's @entity67 , @entity53 designed structures ( shown ) and set up cameras to make the mission a success the bouquet was composed of 30 types of flower including peace lilies , dahlias and orchids and reached a height of about 87,000 feet ( 26,500 metres ) it then fell to @entity26 for 40 minutes before parachutes opened and brought it to the ground			1
the second balloon , carrying the bouquet , made it to about 87,000ft ( 26,500 metres ) in a similar time			0
the cameras used to capture the incredible shots from high altitude were six @entity105 video cameras , donated by @entity106			0
the bouquet was composed of 30 types of flower including peace lilies , dahlias and orchids			0
the two separate structures were sent to the edge of space using two helium balloons ( shown ) ' flowers are n't just beautiful to show on tables , ' said @entity53 ( pictured )			1
' i wanted to see the movement and beauty of plants and flowers suspended in space ' @entity53 explained that the bright colours were intended to contrast against the blackness of space			0
a six - rod axis was used to hold all of the different flowers in place while they ascended into the atmosphere			2
the bonsai used , meanwhile , was a 50 - year - old pine that was flown to @entity56 from @entity10			1
this was then suspended in a light metal frame			0
despite having a tracker on each structure that launched into space , neither was found after the launch to the edge of space			2
@entity53 , however , heralded the mission a great success			0
the bonsai , suspended in a light metal frame , was a 50 - year - old pine that was flown to @entity56 from @entity10 @entity53 explained that the bright colours were intended to contrast against the blackness of space when the balloons burst both bonsai and bouquet descended under parachute , but neither were found and recovered			1

@entity1 artist @entity9 has sent a bonsai tree and a *variety* of flowers into the upper atmosphere
the 38 - year - old from @entity10 flew out to @entity56 to launch the mission with the help of a 10 - person crew
the two separate structures were sent to the edge of space using two helium balloons
cameras were also *attached* to both structures to capture stunning *photography* against the *darkness* of space
both rose to a height of about *17* miles ( 27km ) before the balloons popped and they *plummeted* back to @entity26
