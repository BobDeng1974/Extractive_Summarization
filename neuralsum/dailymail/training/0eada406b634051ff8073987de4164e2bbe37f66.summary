@entity0 died in 1962 a writer telling the story of a serial killer who inspired the play and 1944 movie ' @entity6 ' is hoping the @entity7 will order records related to her incarceration in a state mental hospital to be opened			1
@entity11 , an @entity12 author writing a book about the killer , @entity0 , is far from certain he 'll win the order though			1
@entity11 made his first request for public records in 2010 about her years in a @entity20 psychiatric hospital			1
she was confined there in 1924 after she poisoned a resident of her nursing home with arsenic and lived there until her death in 1962			1
after moving through lower courts for the last few years , the state @entity7 has scheduled a hearing for jan. 14			0
' i 'm keeping my fingers crossed , ' @entity11 said			2
' i 'm not real optimistic			0
' he initially filed a complaint with the @entity34 , saying the @entity35 and @entity36 violated the state @entity37 by denying his request for @entity0 's psychiatric and medical records			2
' she never testified , she was never interviewed ... you never get in her head			0
' the state @entity34 said @entity0 's psychiatric records were confidential under state law , which prohibits communications and records related to a patient 's mental condition from being disclosed without consent			2
@entity57 and @entity58 pictured in the 1944 film ' @entity6 ' however , the commission said @entity0 's privacy rights terminated on her death			1
' because @entity0 was an infamous arsenic murderess , ' her medical records were related to legitimate matters of public concern , according to court papers			2
the @entity35 and @entity36 appealed and a court rejected its claim that the psychiatrist - patient privilege of state law applies to any record generated at a mental health facility , including @entity0 's			0
but the judge agreed with the agency that most of @entity0 's medical records were exempt from disclosure			0
the @entity34 appealed , claiming the trial court substituted its judgment for its determination that disclosing @entity0 's medical records would be an invasion of personal privacy			0
@entity11 said he 's puzzled by the state 's insistence that records dating back more than half a century may not be made public			0
@entity0 has no surviving family members , he said , citing the 1968 death of her daughter , who did not have children			1
' who 's going to be hurt by the release of this ? ' he asked			0
the 1944 film starred oscar - winner @entity57 and @entity58 .			1
