by @entity0 published : 18:33 est , 1 april 2013 updated : 01:29 est , 2 april 2013 the night shift was under way at our police station in @entity5 when a 999 call came through			1
i was an inspector in those days , and felt a frisson of excitement as i received the report of a burglary at a nearby detached home			2
this was what i really loved about my job : chasing and nicking criminals			2
it was why i ’d joined the police			1
' proper copper ' : @entity0 says punches and kicks were all part of the job immediately , i left the station with several officers and we raced to the house whose owner had reported the break - in			1
the burglar was said to be lurking somewhere in the garden			2
without hesitation and despite my short stature , i decided to climb over a high wall to catch the thief			0
as i leapt up and put my hands on top of the wall to pull myself over it , i felt a sharp , stabbing pain			0
the surface had been covered in broken glass , precisely to deter any attempted intrusion			0
i could feel the thick , warm blood streaming down my outstretched arms			0
but there was no turning back			0
even with these serious cuts , i hauled myself over the wall and into the garden			0
sadly , my efforts were in vain , for under the cover of darkness the burglar had managed to escape			0
i had no alternative but to give up the chase and make my way to hospital , where my bleeding wounds were sewn up and bandaged			0
throughout this experience and its aftermath , never once did i dream of suing the owner of the house over the injuries i received from his strategically placed broken glass			1
i , and all my colleagues , knew that physical damage was an inevitable part of our job in the frontline of the war against crime			0
i was reminded of that incident this week when i read about the outrageous decision by pc @entity79 , a constable from @entity81 , to take legal action against the owner of a petrol station in @entity85 after she tripped up over a kerb while investigating a break - in there			1
unlike me , the litigious @entity89 does not appear to have suffered any serious injury at all , yet she is pursuing the garage owner for £ 50,000			1
shamefully , she is supported in this frivolous claim not only by a firm of self - seeking lawyers but also by the @entity96 , the representative body of the force ’s personnel			1
what is so disturbing is that this action , despite its absurdity , is hardly an isolated case			1
@entity105 @entity79 , left , is suing burglary victim @entity106 , right , after she tripped on a 6in kerb at his garage , pictured , while investigating a break - in as this paper revealed yesterday , the insidious spread of the compensation culture means police officers are grabbing more than £ 20 million a year in the settlement of personal - injury claims			1
slips , grazes , falls , and animal attacks are all fodder for this growing barrage of self - serving litigation			1
a bruise is no longer just an occupational hazard for a copper , but rather a cue for financial reparation			0
all this is a world away from the culture of policing when i was rising through the ranks			0
during my career i sustained my fair share of knocks , yet , like all my colleagues , i would have regarded the idea of compensation as laughable , even offensive			1
punches in the face , kicks on the head , pokes in the eye and even a bayonet into my flesh were all part of the job			0
‘ back again , @entity0 ? ’ the nurses used to say at my local accident - and - emergency department when i turned up with another injury			1
on one occasion , i fell off high school - gates while chasing a burglar , landing heavily on my back , but it never occurred to me to sue the school or local education authority			1
even more serious was an incident in 1981 , when i was driving a @entity156 through @entity157 in @entity5			0
as i went through the streets , i caught sight of a notorious local criminal , wanted for grievous bodily harm , drinking outside a pub. i stopped the vehicle , leapt out and walked over to him with the immortal words : ‘ you ’re nicked			0
’ unfortunately , several of this thug ’s family were in the pub. at once , a fracas started , during which i was kicked so forcefully under the chin that my spine was fractured			0
@entity175 tripped while investigating the break in at the @entity177 in @entity85 , @entity81			1
owner @entity106 said it is example of the ' fallacy that someone is to blame for every accident ' luckily , i recovered after a spell in hospital			1
but again , i would never have considered any demand for compensation			0
all that has changed — and there are several reasons			0
i think it partly reflects a dramatic shift in the nature of modern policing			0
when i was in the force , police officers were expected to be tough , both physically and mentally resilient			1
standards of fitness had to be kept high , something that obviously does not apply in the case of pc @entity79 , who looks like she regards the gym as an entirely alien environment			1
moreover , in a predominantly masculine culture , courage was an absolutely core quality			0
we were duty - bound to advance towards danger , rather than hide behind risk assessments and safety guidelines			1
because our task was to protect the public , risk was just part of the job			0
nowadays , police officers and fire - fighters wo n’t even go into a 3ft pond to rescue someone			1
and when that kind of risk - averse culture is all you know — and is drummed into you by your bosses — then you will probably think it ’s perfectly acceptable to sue someone if you trip over a kerb			1
despite the dangers , we were nothing like as well - equipped as officers today			2
going into basements , lofts , factories and alleys , we carried little more than a truncheon and a torch , in contrast to the vast array of protective gear today ’s police wear , which makes them look more like @entity240 battlefield troops than constables			2
but again it is telling that , despite all the technical advances in equipment , @entity89 appears to have overlooked something as basic as using her torch			0
in addition , the police over recent decades have increasingly retreated from the streets			2
when i was a serving officer , going out on the beat was regarded as the most essential element of policing , to deter crime , provide a reassuring presence to the public and build a knowledge of a neighbourhood			2
the insidious spread of the compensation culture means police officers are grabbing more than £ 20 ¿ million a year in the settlement of personal - injury claims tragically , beat policing is now treated as an irrelevance and given a far lower priority than other tasks such as holding meetings , monitoring the internet , attending training courses or dealing with paperwork			1
so officers have far less hard experience of life on the streets			0
and when they do venture out , they tend to go in pairs , something that would have been unthinkable in my time because it is such a colossal waste of manpower			0
the justification for this rigid policy of pairing is that it supposedly helps in the corroboration of evidence at any crime scene , but in reality it shows a crippling lack of self - confidence and authority			2
but perhaps the most important reason for the shift in policing culture is the fact that , like all major institutions , the police mirror the worst changes in our society			2
the forces of safety bureaucracy and the compensation culture have been spreading their malign influence across the whole of @entity305 in recent years , fuelled by measures such as the introduction of ‘ no - win , no - fee ’ law - suits in 1998 , and the notorious @entity309 , which has overthrown basic common sense in so many public services			2
only last week , it emerged that teachers are now annually awarded £ 25 million for injuries and discrimination in the classroom — another indicator of how rife cash - grabbing has become			1
but the police should know better			2
officers are employed to protect the public , not exploit them for financial gain			0
in particular , the @entity96 and senior officers should not be colluding with this destructive trend			1
the @entity96 should be battling to uphold the true principles of policing that used to serve this country so well , ensuring the spirit of public service remains at the heart of all operations			1
turning itself into a shabby arm of the litigation industry , complete with endless adverts for law firms , is an utter betrayal of those basic values			0
similarly , the top ranks of the force should stop being so supine , obsessed with every nuance of political correctness and desperate to show how progressive they are			0
they are not directors of social services or health - and - safety bureaucrats			2
they are crime - fighting chiefs , and if they want to do their jobs properly , they need to concentrate on raising standards of fitness , improving recruitment , and putting officers back on the beat			2
and with regard to pc @entity79 , the worst of it is , she ’s far from being the only one milking the taxpayer for injuries that my generation would simply have shrugged off .			1

former *metropolitan* police chief *superintendent* @entity0 had his fare share of knocks when he was an officer
@entity356 @entity79 is to take legal action against the owner of a petrol station
