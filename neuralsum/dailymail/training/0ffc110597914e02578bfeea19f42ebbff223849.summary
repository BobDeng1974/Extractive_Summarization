the condition has led to his chest becoming asymmetrical the father - of - one says the stress of his condition is making him ill - and he desperately wants surgery the condition can can affect one or both breasts , sometimes unevenly			1
while it is n't a threat to health , it can cause great emotional distress to those affected			2
mr @entity7 , a father - of - one , says he is so distressed by his appearance he can no longer go to the gym or show his chest on the beach			1
he is now desperate to have surgery to make his breasts more symmetrical			1
however the @entity2 has refused to fund the op because there is no demonstrable health benefit to having it			1
mr @entity7 , from @entity44 , @entity45 , said has now been told it will cost more than £ 3,000 to have an operation privately - money he does not have			1
mr @entity7 believes he has a right to have surgery on the @entity2 - but has been refused the op the hotel chef , who weighs 9st , said : ' about six months ago i noticed one side of my chest was bigger than the other			1
' it 's now got to the point where i ca n't go to the gym , or the beach on a sunny day and take off my t - shirt			1
i 'm scared people are staring at me			0
' my friends were shocked i had a boob and said i should seek help			0
' i was told it is fatty tissue that needs removing - and it 's only going to get bigger			2
' he insists private surgery is not an option due to his personal circumstances			0
' i have a young son and a family to feed and clothe - i do n’t have that kind of money			0
i need the operation to remove the lump and gristle , which is causing the problem			0
' he added : ' i pay taxes and @entity83			0
all i ’m asking is for the @entity2 to do its job and fix my issue , which i should n't have to pay for			2
the stress of it all is making me ill. ' women get boob jobs on the @entity2 but i ca n't get help - it 's very upsetting			1
' a spokesman for @entity45 and @entity91 said : ' when making these decisions we have a responsibility to take into account ethical issues , safety , clinical effectiveness and cost effectiveness , balancing the needs of the majority with the differing needs of the individual			0

' however when there is no demonstrable health benefit to the individual the @entity2 is unlikely to agree funding			1
' the breast is made up of two main components , glandular tissue ( firm and dense ) and fatty tissue ( soft )			2
the ratio of glandular to fatty tissue in any breast varies from individual to individual and in gynaecomastia there may be an excess of both			2
if there is predominantly a diffuse fatty enlargement of the breast , liposuction is the usual treatment			0
this involves sucking out the tissue through a small tube inserted via a 3 - 4mm incision			2
if excess glandular tissue is the primary cause of breast enlargement , it may need to be excised ( cut out ) with a scalpel			2
this will leave a scar , usually around the nipple edge			0
this excision can be performed alone or in conjunction with liposuction			0
major reductions that involve the removal of a significant amount of tissue and skin may require larger incisions that result in more obvious scars			0
most operations for gynaecomastia take about 90 minutes and are performed under general anaesthetic , or in some cases , under local anaesthesic with sedation			0
