by @entity0 published : 14:01 est , 26 october 2012 updated : 15:07 est , 26 october 2012 a woman who was filmed swearing and abusing people on a train in @entity4 , got what she deserved when she was thrown off onto her backside by other passengers			1
the triumphant moment when her fellow commuters gang up on her and physically move her off the train was caught on camera and has become a hit on @entity13			2
the video shows the young blonde spitting , swearing and hitting @entity17 commuters until they finally snap and kick her off the train			1
the commuters initially try to ignore the ranting woman as she spits at them while shouting : ' f * * * off you c * * * * , come on you little dogs step up ! ' after ten minutes of constant abuse a middle - aged man standing nearby attempts to calm her down , but instead the woman starts battering him			2
shortly afterwards some of her victims lose their patience with the young woman and as the train pulls into a station , five of them take action			0
they gather her bags and throw them onto the platform , swiftly followed by the woman herself			0
bad behaviour : she gets physically violent towards multiple passengers on the train using abusive language violent : the blonde woman , who has not been identified , slaps a fellow passenger disgusting : if the swearing and hitting was not enough , the misbehaving young woman starts spitting after landing on the platform floor on her bottom the woman can be seen sheepishly staring at the vigilante travellers in disbelief who laugh and cheer in triumph			1
eventually as the video ends a security guard at the station escorts the woman away			2
the video is becoming a @entity13 hit with over 100 views every day			1
kicked off : the other passengers finally have enough and throw her out on her bottom when the train stops one user , called @entity77 , posted : ' if she wants to act like a bloke and get in their faces and spit on them she should be treated like a bloke and get knocked out			0
' i dont ( sic ) promote violence against women at all but in circumstances like this the first time she spat on me i would 've knocked her out			0
' user @entity90 added : ' why ca n't passengers do this in my country ? everyone just stands around and pretends it 's not happening			0
