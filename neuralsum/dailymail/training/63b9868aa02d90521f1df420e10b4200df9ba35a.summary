millions of @entity1 mosquitoes created in @entity3 laboratories are about to be released into the jungles of @entity5 to tackle the spread of @entity7 to humans			1
the idea is that the male insects are on a suicide mission which involves mating with wild females before they and their offspring die			1
this , in theory , will reduce the number of wild mosquitoes which carry and spread @entity7 , which causes serious symptoms ranging from high temperatures and muscle pain to bleeding			1
the latest initiative follows a similar project earlier this year in which genetically modified mosquitoes were created to combat the fever however , @entity3 campaigners warn that proper safeguards have not been established with the result that unintended consequences could make the disease situation even worse			0
the @entity3 company @entity30 , has developed the technology to create genetically modified insects which , it claims , can also be used instead of chemicals to protect food crops from pests			0
the firm has held preliminary talks with @entity3 authorities about releasing @entity1 insects into @entity3 fields or greenhouses to reduce pest numbers			2
the @entity1 mosquito trials are due to start on february 15 in @entity45 , in the @entity47 district of @entity5			2
scientists have used mosquitoes for researching the spread of disease for years , often using themselves as human guinea pigs in the experiments @entity30 conducted its first experiments of @entity1 mosquitoes in the @entity56 in 2009 and 2010 , followed by a smaller experiment in @entity58 in 2010 and 11			1
in several trials , successive releases of the @entity30 males have been shown to reduce substantially the wild population of dengue mosquitoes in the treated area they have been approved by the @entity66 but critics claim no information about the possible downsides have been provided to members of the public			2
@entity30 conducted its first open release experiments of @entity1 mosquitoes in the @entity56 in 2009 - 10 followed by a smaller experiment in @entity58 in 2010 - 11			1
both countries have halted further releases			0
larger - scale experiments began in @entity77 in february 2011 and are still on - going			0
director of genewatch @entity3 , dr @entity79 , said : ‘ local people should be aware that releasing large numbers of @entity1 mosquitoes can pose risks to their health and the environment			1
' they also need to know who will be liable if anything goes wrong			0
will @entity30 take responsibility for any problems , or just walk away ? ’ @entity89 said changes could be introduced into the wild population which means the @entity7 they spread becomes more dangerous to humans			1
there is currently no vaccine for dengue fever so authorities advise the best way to prevent catching the infection is to take precautions when travelling in high - risk areas , such as wearing protective clothing or using a mosquito repellent , stock image pictured , throughout the day and night it claims that if the numbers of one type of mosquito - aedes aegypti – is reduced as result of the release of @entity1 versions , others , such as the @entity114 mosquito , which also carry the virus , could come in and thrive			1
it said there is no evidence from experiments conducted to date that human cases of @entity7 fall as a result of releasing the @entity1 insects			1
the release of @entity1 insects is supposed to involve only males , however it has emerged that a large number of biting female mosquitoes have also been released during experiments			1
‘ local people should be aware that releasing large numbers of @entity1 mosquitoes can pose risks to their health and the environment			2
' they also need to know who will be liable if anything goes wrong			0
will @entity30 take responsibility for any problems , or just walk away ? ’ @entity30 ’s chief executive , @entity139 , insisted the release of the insects is being properly policed			0
he said : ‘ @entity5 have been through a rigorous regulatory review of @entity30 ’s @entity1 mosquitoes			2
' approval for the evaluation has been given by @entity5 ’s @entity145 , the @entity146			0
‘ over the last five years there has also been considerable public engagement within @entity5 at national and local levels , in which @entity89 has been involved , and no doubt this consultation process will continue			0
‘ the evaluation will be conducted by the @entity153 , an institute with a worldwide reputation in developing approaches to combat disease carrying mosquitoes			0
‘ we believe @entity89 should respect the sovereignty , expertise and authority of @entity5 in making decisions for the benefit of their own people			0

male mosquitoes to be sent on suicide mission to mate with wild females
the theory is the *breeding* will spread the @entity1 genes in the offspring
@entity7 can cause high temperatures , muscle pains or bleeding
