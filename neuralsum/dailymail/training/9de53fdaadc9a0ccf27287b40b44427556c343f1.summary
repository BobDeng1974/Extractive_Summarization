it 's not often you see @entity2 come to the rescue , but he was so effective in that second half against @entity5			1
i ’m not sure @entity7 will work in that lone striker role just yet and @entity2 did well when he came on			1
it ’s only his fourth goal against a top five side in the @entity12 — two of the others also came against @entity5 and the fourth against @entity15 — and that is something he has to work on			1
making a difference : @entity2 celebrates his fine header against @entity5 at @entity21 on saturday physical presence : @entity23 immediately offered more going forward after the @entity25 's introduction ups and downs : @entity2 held the ball up well for the @entity29 but did miss a fine chance soon after coming on no player has scored more headed goals in the @entity12 since the beginning of last season than @entity2			1
he needs to make more contributions in the big games , and that starts this week against @entity38			1
with @entity39 suspended , @entity2 will be a key player if they want to qualify for the @entity41			1
but if he gets injured , @entity23 do look short on options up front			0
heading in the right direction : @entity2 's header grabbed @entity23 a point after they had been two goals down right - backs are having an impact with @entity51 failing to impress at the @entity52 and @entity53 not progressing quickly enough , @entity50 will hope someone can make the @entity55 right back spot their own			1
the good news is that with @entity58 , @entity59 and @entity60 , there are some exciting young players making their mark			2
the thing i like about all three is they are comfortable on the ball — something that ’s so important in the modern game — and they are versatile			2
on the scoresheet again : @entity60 has scored in each of @entity72 's @entity12 games so far this campaign i was at @entity74 on sunday and i was very impressed by @entity60			1
yes , he has scored two good goals in two matches , but it ’s his all - round game that is making him stand out			0
2 - in just two appearances for @entity81 's side @entity60 has scored more goals than any @entity72 defender did in the whole of 2013 - 14			1
he looks a good athlete and is clearly happy playing in a variety of positions			0
his dad was a tennis player so he ’s got a good sporting background and @entity91 , who knows the family , says @entity60 is not your average footballer — he is polite and a well - rounded young man			1
he ’s made an excellent start but — and there ’s always a ‘ but ’ with young players — we ’ll find out a lot more about him if he faces the likes of @entity102 and @entity103 against @entity15 next sunday			0
@entity105 's raid on the palace after all the drama of last season , @entity107 will be pleased with how his team has started this one			1
he talks about how much pressure he is under but if they keep producing performances like saturday ’s , that pressure will disappear			2
his side were unlucky not to get something at home to @entity72 on the opening weekend and were excellent against @entity118			2
they did to @entity118 what @entity118 did to other teams last year under @entity122 — beat them with good , efficient football			0
as for the home team , after all the chaos of last week , they looked rudderless			0
they need to get a manager in there as soon as possible to take charge			0
@entity118 lost nine of their first 10 fixtures last season			0
if they ’re not careful and do n’t get a new man in soon , they could beat that record and lose their first 10			0
looking up : @entity138 's impressive win against @entity118 has helped ease pressure on @entity107 naismith the unsung hero much has been made of @entity5 ’s big - name players , but @entity142 is now a real unsung hero			1
@entity143 started @entity144 on the right side , which left @entity142 room to pop up in the middle			1
@entity142 has been involved in seven goals in his last 10 @entity12 appearances for @entity5			1
he has scored five and assisted two during that time			0
he is now a master of finding himself in the right place at the right time , and he scored another good goal against @entity23 on saturday			0
he was fortunate with the offside call , but it was a clever run and he finished his chance well , slotting the ball through @entity158 ’s legs			0
he is now one of @entity5 ’s most valuable assets			2
deserves credit : @entity5 attacker @entity142 has started the new season just how he finished the last united lack a cutting edge another week and another disappointing @entity164 performance			1
you can see why they are desperate for the @entity167 signing to go through			2
when i played @entity164 you were almost more scared on the ball because if you lost it they would be all over you in seconds			2
this side just lack pace			0
@entity174 can help but i ’m interested to see where he will fit in with @entity176 ’s 3 - 5 - 2 system			0
when a player like @entity174 becomes available , it ’s no wonder @entity164 go after him			2
but it ’s plain to see he is the signing they least need to make			0
their priority has to be a defender and a deep - lying midfielder to dictate the play			0
imminent arrival : @entity167 is set to join @entity164 from @entity188 in a move worth £ 65million @entity192 's @entity191 at @entity190 @entity190 were a farce last season , when they went through three managers in as many months			1
but the way things are going , with three straight losses in the @entity197 , they could go through another three this time round .			0

@entity202 *international* proved his *ability* in the second half at @entity21
@entity7 does not look comfortable playing through the middle , so @entity207 should make @entity2 the key man in that position
@entity60 's performances for @entity72 in their first two league games have put him in the running to succeed @entity51 as @entity55 right - back
@entity164 were *sorely* lacking a cutting edge against @entity217
@entity167 will help that but it is in defence where they really *struggled*
@entity5 forward @entity142 is finally getting the *praise* he deserves
pressure is easing on @entity107 after some decent @entity138 *displays*
