the family of sir @entity1 pleaded with him not to convert to @entity2 , a newly - discovered letter from his future sister - in - law has revealed			1
the prime minister who led @entity6 to victory in the @entity8 was apparently so taken with @entity2 and @entity10 culture that his relatives wrote to try and persuade him not to become a @entity12			1
he had been exposed to the religion during his time serving in @entity15 and @entity16			1
right : @entity23 in @entity15 , where he was exposed to @entity2 the letter , pictured above , was discovered by @entity26 , a history research fellow at @entity27			1
in it she writes that @entity1 has a ' tendency to orientalise @entity32 - like tendencies ' the revelation contradicts some of the beliefs expressed by @entity1 in his own writings			1
in the note , written in august 1907 , lady @entity18 - who would later marry his brother , @entity38 - urged @entity1 to ' fight against ' the desire to convert			1
she wrote : ' please do n’t become converted to @entity2 ; i have noticed in your disposition a tendency to orientalise [ fascination with the @entity45 and @entity2 ] , @entity32 - like tendencies , i really have			1
' if you come into contact with @entity2 your conversion might be effected with greater ease than you might have supposed , call of the blood , do n’t you know what i mean , do fight against it			1
' the letter was discovered by @entity26 , a history research fellow at @entity27 , while researching his forthcoming book , @entity1 and the @entity56 : @entity57 , @entity58 and @entity59 in the @entity60			2
he told the @entity62 that @entity64 's concerns may not have been unfounded as @entity1 admired the military prowess and expansion of the @entity67			2
@entity6 prime minister @entity1 , centre , sitting with his son @entity69 , left , brother @entity23 , right , and nephew @entity23			0
at one point , his family were concerned that he would convert to @entity2 the future prime minister also took the progressive stance that @entity2 and @entity74 should be viewed as equal			1
in the same year as @entity76 's letter , @entity1 wrote one to @entity77 that read : ' you will think me a pasha [ a rank of distinction in the @entity67 ]			0
i wish i were '			0
dr @entity84 said that @entity23 had ' much experience on being in " @entity2 areas " after serving in @entity16 and on the @entity87 of @entity15			1
but he added that his fascination was ' largely predicated on @entity90 notions which heavily romanticised the nomadic lifestyle and honour culture of the @entity94 tribes '			0
there is also conflicting evidence of @entity23 's own beliefs , as included in his book , @entity98 , right which was published in 1899			0
one passage focuses on his observations about @entity2			0
left : @entity1 @entity1 's true understanding was so limited that , during his term as colonial secretary in the early 1920s , he had to ask what the difference was between @entity106 and @entity107			0
dr @entity84 told @entity108 that @entity1 was never truly serious about converting			0
he said that @entity1 ' was more or less an atheist by this time anyway			2
he did however have a fascination with @entity2 culture which was common among @entity112			2
' there is also conflicting evidence of @entity23 's own beliefs , as included in his book , @entity98 , which was published in 1899			0
one passage of the book focuses on @entity23 's observations about @entity2 while serving during the @entity122 - @entity121 reconquest of the @entity16			1
it reads : ' the fact that in @entity127 law every woman must belong to some man as his absolute property – either as a child , a wife , or a concubine – must delay the final extinction of slavery until the faith of @entity2 has ceased to be a great power among men			2
' thousands become the brave and loyal soldiers of the faith : all know how to die but the influence of the religion paralyses the social development of those who follow it			0
' no stronger retrograde force exists in the world			0
far from being moribund , @entity127 is a militant and proselytizing faith			0

sir @entity1 was fascinated with @entity2 and @entity10 culture
he had been exposed to the religion during his time in @entity15 and @entity16
his future sister - in - law urged him to ' fight against ' the desire to convert
