by @entity0 last updated at 2:37 pm on 24th october 2011 the full brutality of former @entity4 tyrant @entity3 's regime has been revealed in chilling video footage of prison torture sessions			2
and the fallen dictatorship 's former foreign minister , @entity7 - who was released by the @entity10 authorities six months ago after he defected to the @entity10 in march - is facing fresh allegations that he was directly involved in the beating of political prisoners			1
the footage - obtained by the @entity17 's @entity16 programme - was reportedly shot at the notorious @entity18 in @entity19			0
it shows crouching inmates , blindfolded and wearing blue uniforms , being repeatedly whipped and kicked by interrogators			0
brutal : a still from footage of a prisoner being whipped inside the @entity18 during @entity3 's rule last month the remains of more than 1,200 prisoners were found in a mass grave outside the prison 's walls			2
the panorama team tracked down @entity7 to a luxury resort in @entity34 during its investigation into his role in alleged war crimes			1
he declined to be interviewed for the programme			0
@entity7 was head of @entity3 's intelligence agency from 1994 and a senior intelligence agent when @entity42 flight 103 was blown up over @entity43			1
inhumane : an inmate is kicked in the head by one official as a prison guard looks on back in the spotlight : torture suspect @entity7 defected to @entity10 in april but moved to @entity34 just weeks later the @entity50 jumbo jet was en route from @entity52 to @entity53 when it exploded over the @entity55 town , killing 243 passengers , 16 crew and 11 residents			1
there have also been calls for @entity7 to be quizzed in relation to the murder of pc @entity63 , who was shot during a protest outside @entity52 's @entity4 embassy in 1984			1
@entity7 made a high - profile defection to @entity10 in march and was interviewed by police and @entity70 prosecutors investigating the @entity43 attack			1
but within weeks he was allowed to leave the @entity10 following an @entity73 decision to lift sanctions against him , meaning he no longer faces travel restrictions or an asset freeze			0
no comment : panorama reporter @entity78 is blocked by a bodyguard while attempting to question @entity7 the @entity80 said @entity7 was a ' private individual ' who had been interviewed voluntarily			1
but the ruling was condemned by one @entity83 mp who said @entity10 had become ' a transit lounge for alleged war criminals '			0
and @entity10 is now under fresh pressure to interview @entity7 in relation to the allegations			1
dr @entity90 , whose 23 - year - old daughter @entity91 died in the @entity43 bombing , said that if anyone could offer any insight into the ' huge questions still unanswered ' on @entity4 's role in @entity43 , it would be mr @entity7			1
high profile : @entity7 was less reluctant about speaking to the press following his defection to @entity52 earlier this year he said : ' when i met @entity7 in @entity4 in 1991 it was clear to me he was the guy who was central to the @entity3 administration			2
' he could tell us just as much as @entity3 about @entity43 as he was at the core of the regime			2
' he was a very , very key figure and we need answers as to why he was allowed to fly back			0
any probing over his crimes should be done by the @entity109			0
' @entity110 , who lost her 35 - year - old brother @entity111 in the atrocity , said she was ' incensed ' after mr @entity7 was allowed to leave @entity10 in the first place			2
she said : ' we can not turn a politically pragmatic blind eye			0
' i do not know what @entity7 knows or does not know about @entity43 but he needs to come back to answer those questions			1
' i condemn the attitude of the @entity120 in the strongest possible terms			0
a political hands - off attitude is inappropriate			0

@entity7 found in @entity34
new hope for @entity43 *victims* *â€™* families
@entity7 alleged to have taken part in torture *personally*
