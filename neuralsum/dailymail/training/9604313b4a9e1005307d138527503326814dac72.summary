by @entity0 published : 18:17 est , 27 november 2013 @entity2 : 18:30 est , 27 november 2013 what took us so long ? we had lived together for 20 years			1
we were soulmates , best friends , inseparable , @entity6			2
anyone observing my partner , @entity10 , and i together , so at ease with each other , sharing so many interests - from drinking fine wine to long walks in the sun - would have said we were prime candidates for matrimony , a wedding waiting to happen			1
yet something stalled the inevitable , and kept on stalling it			2
two weeks ago , @entity10 and @entity22 , with more than 120 years on the clock between us , walked down the aisle			1
so what took us so long ? just married : @entity0 and @entity10 on their wedding day which took place after they had lived together for 20 years partly it was the caution born of experience			1
we had both been married before , for 13 years apiece			1
when you have learnt the hard way that marriage is no guarantee of living happily ever after , you hesitate before taking the plunge again			1
partly , also , it was simple logistics			2
i am @entity42 and @entity10 is @entity43 , so we could not have married in one hemisphere without disappointing loved ones in the other			1
as the long years passed , compromises were pondered			1
once we found ourselves on a @entity49 island , outside a church , and toyed with getting married then and there and telling people when we got home			1
some couples take that route			2
but mainly , if i am honest , it was apathy			1
why bother ? why go to all the trouble and expense of organising a ceremony whose significance , as we saw it , would be largely symbolic ? neither of us was religious			1
neither of us was minded to view marriage as a solemn sacrament			1
we could not muster the enthusiasm to take a step that did not seem particularly momentous			0
and we were not alone in our apathy			1
happy day : the couple loved taking centre stage as bride and groom for in largely secular 21st - century @entity75 , nobody seems to mind whether couples are married			1
some people tie the knot , some do n't , just as some people smoke and some do n't			1
and with more and more women retaining their maiden names after marriage , and the wearing of rings becoming ever more haphazard , there is often no way of telling if @entity88 and @entity89 are mr and mrs or @entity91 and ms. before , we had just been two people in the crowd			1
now we were the bride and groom , the centre of attention , principal actors in an age - old drama which society invested with profound significance fifty years ago , people might have tut - tutted and told us we were living in sin			1
friends would have taken me aside and urged me to make an honest woman of @entity10			1
nowadays there is no such peer pressure because so many couples have taken the same course as us			0
in the latest census figures , the number of unmarried adults in the @entity75 has crept ahead of the number of married ones for the first time			2
one friend did urge me to get married , but only to save money in death duties			2
there has been not a murmur of disapproval at our living arrangements			2
we were ' partners ' , and happy with that designation			0
signing the register : but @entity0 now knows being married is about more than just a piece of paper so why now ? i would like to say it was the result of long , hard thought , but nothing could be further from the truth			1
when i proposed to @entity10 - on holiday in @entity138 this summer - it was more impulsive than premeditated			1
i simply suggested that , as we were flying out to @entity43 for a wedding in november , we might as well get married ourselves while we were out there			1
she agreed , in the same matter - of - fact spirit			0
it was typical of our approach to life - simple , easy , calm			0
but there was nothing calm or matter - of - fact about what followed			0
the prospect of marriage , and arranging our wedding , had a galvanising effect			1
to the settled routine of our lives , it brought a sense of soaring excitement that neither of us had foreseen			0
as we sketched out our plans - a small wedding in @entity10 's birthplace of @entity164 , followed by a big party in our home town of @entity167 - and took others into our confidence , we realised that we were surfing a tsunami of goodwill			1
before , we had just been two people in the crowd			0
now we were the bride and groom , the centre of attention , principal actors in an age - old drama which society invested with profound significance			0
soulmates : the couple , pictured in 1999 , delayed marriage as they were found divorced and could n't face organising a big wedding the first people we told were my two daughters from my first marriage , now grown up			1
' i never saw this one coming , ' gasped the elder daughter			0
her sister let out a great yodel of excitement			0
the reaction of our friends was equally heartwarming			0
we composed a round - robin email , pressed send and waited gleefully for the explosion			0
did the fact that we were 30 years older than the other couple in the shop , who were also buying a ring , make us feel self - conscious ? not a bit some explosion ! the excited phone calls , the tears , the whoops of joy , the clamour for more details			1
' how good that you have finally decided to join the @entity213 , ' emailed one old friend , @entity214 , who had just celebrated his silver wedding anniversary			1
the tone was ironic but not the sentiment			0
in free - and - easy 2013 , married couples do not exactly feel beleaguered , but they do vaguely worry that they are an endangered species , fuddy - duddy in their attitudes			2
for @entity214 , as for other married friends , our decision to join the club was not just a cause for celebration but a validation of their own lifestyle			2
as we threw ourselves into planning the wedding , we not only found ourselves smiling and giggling like a couple half our age , but realised how much pleasure we were giving others			1
our postman chortled when he heard the news			0
the local newsagent beamed his delight			0
@entity238 stopped us in the street to congratulate us			0
it was if we suddenly possessed a magic aura			0
at the jewellers where we bought the ring , they insisted on serving us bubbly at ten in the morning			0
did the fact that we were 30 years older than the other couple in the shop , who were also buying a ring , make us feel self - conscious ? not a bit of it			2
marriage makes no discrimination on grounds of age			2
we were embarking on the same journey as the other couple and enjoying the same following wind - the good wishes of people , young and old , who thirst for a love story with a happy ending			0
paradise : @entity0 has discovered being husband and wife is better than being just partners ( posed by models ) i dusted off my old suit , and @entity10 started shopping for a suitably funky wedding dress			1
all low - key by some people 's standards , but we felt simultaneously self - conscious and quietly proud			0
the chorus of congratulations was still ringing in our ears when we boarded the plane for @entity164			0
there were still arrangements to be finalised			0
we had found a venue with an appropriately @entity75 feel but not briefed the celebrant , the florist , the harpist , the chef , the sommelier or the rest of the supporting cast			2
it was all pretty hectic and , having promised friends in @entity42 we would make a video , we had to rush around taking shots of kangaroos , surfers and barbecues to prove we ’d married in @entity43 and not the @entity297			2
organising even a small wedding - ours was just 15 guests - involves so much time , trouble and expense that you can see why some couples are put off the idea			1
but we were buoyed by so much goodwill that the days before the wedding flew by in a happy blur			2
the warmth of our welcome @entity310 at least matched the enthusiasm in @entity42			0
@entity10 's 90 - year - old mother was thrilled for us			1
so were all her other relatives			0
as the big day loomed and guests started to gather , i felt such boyish excitement			2
outside i may have looked like an old fuddy - duddy , inside i was a teenager again			0
she , in all her elegance and beauty , was marrying me ! vintage vows @entity75 ’s longest wedded couple are @entity324 and @entity325 , from @entity326 , who have been married for 86 years the most electrifying moment came shortly before the wedding			1
of our guests , all @entity43 , i was told i had met everyone except @entity331 , husband of one of @entity10 's old university friends			1
' you 'll like @entity331 , ' @entity10 assured me			1
like him ? i loved him ! ' @entity335 ' turned out to be a cunning disguise for my sister @entity337 who , unbeknown to me , had flown ten thousand miles to be there			0
as i stared at her in amazement , i could feel tears welling up in my eyes			0
and they welled up again later as i intoned those ancient vows : '			0
in sickness and in health ... so long as we both shall live			2
' @entity10 looked me in the eyes			1
i looked her in the eyes			0
the celebrant pronounced us husband and wife			0
what had we done ? it was certainly not something trivial or ephemeral			0
it reverberated like thunder across the room			0
the day after the wedding , we strolled along the beach			1
after the giddy emotions of the day before , it was a time for sober reflection			2
how will marriage affect our relationship ? will we be less inclined to take each other for granted ? or more inclined ? for simply by making such a public commitment , we have altered the landscape of our lives			1
cynics would say that nothing has changed			0
somehow i hope we can prove the cynics wrong			0
a month ago we were mere partners			0
now we are husband and wife			0
it feels like a promotion .			2

@entity0 and @entity10 have finally tied the knot after living together for 20 years ?
so what took them so long ?
he *explains* here it was part caution after they had both had failed marriage
and part apathy as planning a wedding was so much trouble
but after proposing , he found the wedding build up and day a joy
now they *'re* married , feels their relationship has been *enhanced*
