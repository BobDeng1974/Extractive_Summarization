@entity0 was the best @entity1 midfielder since @entity2 , but you have to ask why @entity4 did n’t get more out of him			1
people talk about @entity6 and @entity7 , but @entity0 had everything — quick as lightning , he covered so much ground , tackled hard and , boy , could he pass			1
the first time i saw him was in training at @entity15 when @entity16 brought him up from the youth team			2
i played the ball into him , expecting this young kid to give it straight back			0
he turned around and hit a raking 30 - yard pass into someone ’s feet			0
he had so much skill and , if you ask players who they would want to play like , plenty would say @entity0			1
he was like @entity38 and when he joined the @entity4 squad i thought he would show that same confidence			2
i soon learned he had the same insecurities as every other player			0
when the team met up i was his club captain , so i went to bring him down for dinner			0
i only discovered later when i read his book that he was terrified to come out of his room			0
he has always been a selfless individual and a bit of a worrier , almost to a fault			0
best since @entity50 : @entity51 believes that @entity0 was the best @entity4 midfielder since @entity2 deserved more : and he warranted more than heartbreak with @entity4 time and time again @entity56 @entity15 legends salute @entity0 he never wants to let people down and playing for his country weighed on his shoulders at @entity60 did n’t help that so many @entity4 managers failed to use him properly and it was embarrassing watching him played wide on the left at the @entity62			1
@entity0 has been a fantastic servant for @entity4 and his talents deserved a place in the semis or a final but , like so many players of his generation , we never made the best of them .			1
