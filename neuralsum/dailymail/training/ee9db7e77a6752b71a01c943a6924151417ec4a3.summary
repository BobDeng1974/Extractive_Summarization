by @entity0 published : 18:14 est , 12 september 2013 updated : 01:53 est , 13 september 2013 grilled by @entity1 : @entity2 , governor of the @entity3 , said was open to moves to cool @entity6 's housing market if it began to over-heat @entity9 prices should not be allowed to rise by more than 5 per cent a year – and the @entity3 should stop them if they do , a report will say today			1
the @entity12 ( @entity12 ) will today call for radical new rules , such as banning banks from lending more than 80 per cent of a property ’s value and shrinking the maximum life of a mortgage			1
in an explosive move , it says urgent action is needed by the bank due to ‘ a growing risk of another house price boom ’			1
yesterday , @entity3 governor @entity2 also signalled to @entity1 that he was open to moves to cool @entity6 ’s housing market if it began to over-heat			1
the institution warned that if action was not taken to control house prices , ‘ another housing bubble , reckless bank lending and a dangerous build - up in household debt ’ could cripple @entity6 again			1
but the move will draw protests from the generation of young people already frozen off the property ladder by house price rises			2
with an average home now costing £ 170,000 , nearly seven times the average full - time salary , the introduction of a compulsory deposit amount – such as 20 per cent – could make it even harder for young people to get on the property ladder			1
critics warn the housing market is already over-heating , with price rises in each of the past seven months , largely fuelled by the government ’s interventions			1
under two controversial schemes , both called help to buy , people are being encouraged to buy a home with a deposit of just 5 per cent			0
the second scheme launches in january			0
in @entity59 – where mr @entity2 ran the @entity60 before coming to the @entity6 in july – 100 per cent mortgages are banned and a minimum deposit of 20 per cent is needed if you are refinancing a loan , and 5 per cent on a new mortgage			0
grilled by @entity66 mp @entity65 about what he would do about ‘ an unhealthy acceleration in house prices ’ , mr @entity2 told the @entity70 that a ‘ more intensive supervision of lending ’ was possible			0
one option is ‘ some guidance provided in terms of loan - to - value ratios ’ , he said			2
the loan - to - value ratio is the figure representing the size of deposit in relation to the property ’s value			2
for example , a £ 10,000 deposit on a £ 100,000 home gives an ratio of 90 per cent			0
but he added : ‘ we do not have powers of direction in that regard , but certainly have an ability to observe and recommend if necessary			0
’ still a dream : with an average home now costing £ 170,000 , nearly seven times the average salary , the introduction of a compulsory deposit amount could make it even harder for youngster to get on the property ladder @entity102 , senior economist at @entity12 and author of the report , said capping house price inflation at 5 per cent per year ‘ would discourage households from taking on excessive debt out of fear of missing out on a price boom ’			1
at present , house prices are rising by 6.2 per cent a year , but rose by up to 30 per cent a year at the height of the boom a decade ago			0
@entity12 said the policy could be introduced on a regional basis , if some areas of the @entity6 are hit by rampant house price inflation but homeowners in other regions experience the opposite			1
but in a recent report , the @entity120 said : ‘ intervention to dampen buoyancy in some locations would almost certainly bear down on other local markets where activity is more subdued , unless carefully targeted			0
’ the number of first - time buyers getting a mortgage has hit the highest level since the credit crunch began in 2007 as banks are offering far more loans which need only a 5 per cent deposit			1
before the credit crunch , there were 1,000 different types of 95 per cent loans			2
during the recession , it dropped to just three , but has rallied to 46			0
█ mr @entity2 admitted to mps that savers had been hammered by record low interest rates designed to encourage people to spend			2
he said thrifty savers and pensioners who have seen their nest eggs eroded by years of dismal returns and high inflation deserve ‘ tremendous sympathy ’			0
but he said holding the bank rate at rock bottom ‘ encourages spending rather than saving ’ and that the rates – which have been held at 0.5 per cent since march 2009 – must not rise any time soon for fear of snuffing out the recovery			2
@entity157 , from campaign group @entity156 , said mr @entity2 ’s comments amounted to : ‘ spend as much as you can , even if it means borrowing to do it and maybe it will ginger up the economy			0
