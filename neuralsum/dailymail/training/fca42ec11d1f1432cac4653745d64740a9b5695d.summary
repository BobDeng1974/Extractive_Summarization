banks are to be investigated for charging some current account customers more for their overdrafts than it would cost to take out a payday loan			1
customers who go into the red are hit with ‘ very high , complex and opaque charges ’ , the @entity5 warned yesterday			1
despite efforts by the @entity11 ( @entity11 ) to control excessive charges , the @entity5 said many customers ‘ may still be paying too much ’			1
the @entity11 regulator of competitive trading and consumer protection - who have been attempting to control the excessive charges it said lenders were making huge amounts from ‘ consumers ’ lack of understanding , confusion and limited attention ’			0
customers owe £ 8billion in overdrafts to banks and building societies , and 15 per cent of those with an overdraft are permanently or usually overdrawn			2
the consumer group which ? said @entity33 and @entity34 were among the main culprits			0
customers using the @entity38 current account and the @entity39 pay £ 100 in charges for going £ 100 into an unauthorised overdraft for a month , equal to an annual percentage rate of 1,200 per cent			1
but it would cost £ 37 to borrow £ 100 from payday lender @entity44 over the same period			0
which ? also found that customers borrowing £ 100 over a month with @entity33 within an agreed overdraft would pay £ 30 for the period , giving an effective apr of 356 per cent			2
following an investigation by the @entity11 , banks have changed overdraft levies from a more traditional interest rate to a daily fee , typically of £ 1 a day or more , saying it is easier to understand			0
despite those who believe they are acting responsibly with their banking , they can sometimes still be hit by large penalties for small overdrafts but the @entity5 , which took over regulation of consumer credit from the @entity11 this month , is concerned that the simpler fees ‘ may be a mechanism by which providers are increasing revenue from authorised overdrafts ’			1
it will investigate fees for authorised and unauthorised overdrafts , as well as how banks set overdraft limits and how they reduce and increase them for customers			0
banks could be fined if the @entity5 finds any wrongdoing , and could be forced to introduce measures to protect customers , such as texts to those near their limit			1
@entity81 , of the @entity5 , said : ‘ just about everybody who banks can have access to some sort of overdraft , whether they ’ve signed up for it or not			1
' this market is huge , and with overdrafts bolted on to over 30million current accounts , we want to make sure it is working well for consumers			0
’ overdrafts are lucrative for banks , which claim they need the fees to provide so - called free current accounts to customers who remain in credit			0
the @entity11 says banks are squeezing nearly £ 2billion a year from customers with unauthorised overdrafts			0
which ? executive director @entity100 said the @entity5 investigation was a ‘ welcome first step towards putting people back in control of their credit ’			2
he added : ‘ we have long called for regulators to clamp down on excessive charges that hit hardest people struggling with their finances			2
' with some unauthorised overdrafts as costly as payday loans , we want charges made clearer so people can compare borrowing options more easily			1
’ the @entity5 probe follows a series of banking scandals , including the mis - selling of payment protection insurance and complaints over fee - charging packaged accounts offering ‘ perks ’ that some customers can not use			1
@entity126 , of the @entity125 , said : ‘ millions of people find overdrafts an easy way to borrow money , more flexible and convenient than a loan			0
overdraft charges have plummeted in recent years			0

customers hit with very large charges for going into the red
some customers prefer entering overdraft rather than using payday loans
despite this , people are finding they are being hit with complex charges
the @entity5 probe follows other banking scandals including the @entity149 scandal
