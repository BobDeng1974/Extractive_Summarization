by @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 published : 20:56 est , 15 november 2012 updated : 21:02 est , 15 november 2012 this is the topless photograph which an @entity5 agent sent to the socialite at the centre of the @entity9 sex scandal			1
@entity10 emailed the picture to @entity12 from an account he shared with his wife , two years before he started the investigation which would lead to the former general 's resignation and very public disgrace			1
it shows the special agent with his shirt off , posing with two bullet - riddled dummies which look remarkably similar to the 47 - year - old			1
amid the heat of that exposure the news of his own apparent indiscretion was treated as another layer of sexual intrigue in this tangled tale			0
in fact , @entity10 insists , it is nothing of the sort			2
the email was a joke that backfired more spectacularly than he could possibly have imagined and , perhaps , was allowed to			2
emails to a friend : socialite @entity12 arrives home in @entity54 on tuesday night the image in question was not some leering pose , directed at the object of his desire , but a round - robin joke - the sort of which the 47 - year - old special agent was in the habit of sending - that ended with a picture punchline			1
in stark contrast to the covert ' dead drop ' technique of @entity73 and @entity9 's email correspondence , @entity10 's message was sent from an account he shared with his wife , teacher @entity75			1
the snapshot showing @entity10 - bald , muscular and shirtless - posed between two buff , bullet - ridden target dummies and carrying the punchline , ' which one is @entity25 ? ' was framed and displayed on his wife 's desk at work			1
his supervisor even pinned it on the notice board in the @entity87			2
serious : @entity10 is pictured at a news conference in july 2005 at the @entity89 in @entity90 in fact as the @entity94 reports , one of the newspaper 's staff was among those to receive the email , sent in 2010 shortly after the special agent had been transferred from @entity98 to the @entity87 's @entity54 office			1
the email was sent on 9 september 2010			0
all of which points to the motivation of the sources that first leaked word of its existence being mischievous at best			0
because if not quite an @entity108 figure fallen to earth , @entity10 reputation has certainly been allowed to wilt in the heat of the media glare			2
july 27 , 2005 , @entity5 agent @entity112 according to the @entity113 , @entity10 has a reputation as a ' hard - charging ' field agent			1
it is a turn of phrase that implies an approach more likely to earn results than friends			0
@entity10 reportedly received a dressing down from his superiors when he impatiently tried to push forward the investigation into the emails received by @entity12			1
it has been alleged that , frustrated by what he perceived as a lack of progress , @entity10 leaked details of the probe to the @entity130 in @entity131 , contacting representative @entity132 in october and asking for his help			2
in the field : in this april 12 , 2007 , photo , @entity112 , right , works a scene in @entity54 , @entity137 mr @entity132 directed him to @entity139 majority leader @entity138 , who eventually passed the message onto the @entity5 director , @entity142 , completing a circle that looped well above the heads of @entity10 ' direct superiors			1
one week later , on november 6th , @entity146 , @entity142 went to @entity147 , the director of national intelligence and @entity9 ' immediate superior - who urged him to resign as head of the @entity151			2
in fact , the @entity152 has written to @entity142 to ask why it took him a week to come forward with the information that @entity10 gave him			0
this photo taken wednesday , nov. 14 , 2012 shows the home owned by @entity5 agent @entity112 in @entity159 , @entity137 this is not the first time @entity10 has found himself on the receiving end of his boss 's opprobrium			1
' @entity25 is a passionate kind of guy , ' said one former colleague			0
' he 's kind of an obsessive type			0
if he locked his teeth onto something , he 'd be a bulldog			0
' @entity10 ' strong sense of right ' led him to push forward the investigation that exposed the affair between @entity177 , pictured above at her brother 's home in @entity181 , and gen @entity9 it did n't take long for that tenacity to show			1
for some who have worked with him it is part of what makes @entity10 ' one of the finest agents there is '			1
it is coupled with a strong sense of right - admirable traits but not always the most welcome combination to those concerned with the subtleties of state and politics			0
@entity10 studied @entity197 at the @entity198 and joined the @entity5 in 1996			1
within two years he was made the case agent in the @entity200 which foiled @entity202 's 1999 plan to attack @entity203			0
the trial judge in that case repeatedly praised @entity10 for his integrity and efforts			0
but the agent still managed to fall foul of his bosses for his outspoken opposition to the decision to turn @entity202 over to @entity214 agents			1
he felt that the tactic would unravel what trust had been established and lead to @entity202 's co-operation drying up			0
having served in @entity218 might have felt himself on safer ground , transferred to the @entity221 , but the opposite has proven true twice over			0
@entity54 society was far more dangerous territory than @entity10 could have known			0
@entity225 , gen. @entity9 ; @entity227 and @entity12 and @entity228 watch the @entity230 parade in @entity54 , @entity137 in 2010 in may 2010 he was attacked by a knife - wielding man , outside @entity232 , @entity54			1
@entity10 , who was training with @entity233 and special - forces soldiers at the base , shot and killed the man			1
in an email to the @entity94 he described the incident : ' i had four seconds that seemed like 40 , to go through my mental checks			0
' conscious of bystanders and cars , he waited , ' till he was five feet from me before firing two rounds ... after repeatedly warning him			0
' i did n't have time to put on my ballistic vest			0
' embroiled : general @entity248 - seen here with wife @entity250 and daughter @entity251 behind him - is now caught up in the scandal after being linked with @entity12 crazy world indeed			2
the scandal that has spun from the investigation first started by @entity10 now involves general @entity248 , who has also found himself accused of ' inappropriate ' email correspondence with @entity12			1
meanwhile , two years after fending off that knife - wielding assailant @entity10 once again finds himself the target of an attack of sorts			2
@entity258 ( left ) and @entity9 ( right ) are both caught up to their necks in the burgeoning sex scandal popular : @entity12 is pictured left in her yearbook photo and with her husband dr. @entity263 , right on moving to @entity54 , @entity10 and his wife became friends of @entity12 and her husband , cancer specialist , @entity227 , socially			1
they dipped into the party circuit and mingling with the @entity270 in @entity54 and the @entity137			0
two years later @entity12 did what @entity12 seems to specialise in doing			2
she called in a favour			0
she told @entity10 about the emails she was receiving , and @entity10 - hard - charging field agent that he is - responded			1
he could never have imagined that in doing so he would uncover a scandal of such magnitude or that he would become a minor casualty of it all - stripped of his shirt and some portion of his credibility			0
video : calls for an investigation into the timeline of the @entity9 affair			2

@entity10 , 47 , is the @entity5 agent who initiated the investigation that brought down @entity291 boss @entity9
he was revealed as the ' shirtless special agent ' accused of becoming ' obsessed ' with @entity137 socialite @entity12
one of the ' finest agents in the field ' the emails were a joke , he says , sent two years *ago* from a joint email account shared by his wife
he pushed the @entity303 investigation into the spotlight with a ' sense of right ' that has put him on the wrong side of @entity87 bosses before
