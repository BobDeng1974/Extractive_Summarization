a millionaire has won a legal victory which could see a £ 10.5 million solar farm removed at a cost of £ 1.5 million - because it overshadows his @entity4 listed home			1
@entity6 from @entity7 , @entity8 , was horrified when developers started constructing the 54 - acre site on the doorstep of his six - bedroom @entity4 listed home - which is worth almost £ 3million			1
he claims he was not informed of the planning application by the local authority - despite the development being just 45 metres from the boundary of his property			1
@entity20 ( pictured ) mr @entity6 's @entity4 listed home has six bedrooms and is worth almost £ 3million @entity23 , based near mr @entity6 's home , was opened in june last year at a lost of £ 10.5 million mr @entity6 only became aware of the project when he went out for a walk in march last year and found construction was already underway			1
he took his case to the @entity29 where he argued that @entity30 should also have been consulted as a listed property was involved			1
one of the country 's top judges , mr @entity34 , upheld his claim and has ordered @entity36 to reconsider the planning application for the site			1
@entity6 ( pictured ) was ' horrified ' when developers started constructing the 54 - acre solar farm on the doorstep of his @entity4 listed home if it is refused the solar farm - which became operational in june last year - may have to be ripped up and the council could be sued by the developers			1
mr @entity6 , who has lived in @entity7 for five years , has now spoken of his victory for the first time			2
the father - of - three said he was compelled to act and save the beautiful countryside around his home for future generations			0
' this case is about @entity36 not following a prescribed , legal planning process but it is also about what it means to live in the countryside and what we leave for the next generation , ' he said			1
' you can imagine my shock and horror in march 2014 when i left my house with my two year old to take a walk through our garden into the open countryside			0
' i could not believe the scale of the development that had started and immediately rushed back inside to phone @entity36			2
' the decision to place a 22.1 hectare solar farm on productive farmland , next to a @entity74 and in beautiful , open countryside was made by one person - the planning officer			1
' a decision to build a massive , industrial development in the countryside should have gone to the @entity80			2
' with help one family was able to challenge a multi-billion pound @entity84 company and a local council with a £ 350 million overall budget			2
' that shows the @entity89 legal system works and should encourage other individuals to stand up against inappropriately sited , large - scale development			0
' @entity6 is pictured addressing @entity8 council over the installation of a solar farm near his home the submitted plans - the council has now been told to reconsider the planning applicatiom @entity23 , operated by @entity98 and @entity99 , was opened in june last year at a lost of £ 10.5 million			1
should the solar farm be forced to be dismantled it could cost more than £ 1.5 million to restore the site			1
@entity36 could also face a hefty bill if they are sued by the solar giants			1
mr @entity106 granted ruled that the site had been built with an unlawful planning permission on the grounds that the effect on mr @entity6 's listed home had not been considered			1
he said : ' it follows that from the record of the decision , the listed building and its setting was affected			0
' this needed to be evaluated			0
the statutory scheme requires @entity30 to have the chance to input into that evaluation			2
' it is precisely the matter on which @entity30 's expert views should be sought			2
the failure to do so in this case was in my view a clear legal error			0
' the issues in relation to @entity130 have not been considered properly			0
' the status of @entity130 as a @entity4 listed building and the failure to give its interests a proper and lawful consideration attracts in my view very significant weight in the overall balance of considerations			0
' mr @entity6 , who lives with his wife , @entity140 and his daughter , @entity142 , added that if the solar development was removed the locals could once again enjoy their village			1
he said : ' the future of the @entity148 solar farm is bleak			1
' as of thursday , march 5 2015 , the whole development does not have planning permission and is unlawful			0
' it is clearly inappropriately sited , destroying what were once productive and beautiful , open , agricultural fields			0
' @entity7 has been treated unfairly by the @entity154			0
' these planning officers pushed to approve three , large - scale , industrial solar farms in one , idyllic , beautiful village			0
mr @entity6 claims he was not informed of the planning application by @entity36 - despite the solar development ( pictured ) being just 45 metres from the boundary of his @entity4 listed property a protest organised by @entity164 group who have mobilised to fight the development of solar farms ' these once beautiful fields were where i was privileged to meet other residents of @entity7			1
' it is a friendly village and families used to enjoy walking these once open , productive fields with their dogs			0
' that is impossible now with a fenced - in , 22.1 hectare solar farm and believe me ; i have not once seen a sheep grazing in this solar monstrosity , as claimed by the @entity180 and developers			1
' we all are in favour of renewable energy , if the planning process is lawful and the development is appropriately sited			0
' this was not the case with the @entity23			0
' a spokesperson for @entity36 said it carried out ' extensive publicity ' about the application and will now consider an appeal			2
' we are disappointed with the ruling and will be considering our position regarding a possible appeal			0
' we carried out extensive publicity concerning this application at the time , including site notices , a press notice and notifying neighbours we considered would be affected			0
' we will now meet with the landowners to ensure accurate plans of the development are submitted before consulting with @entity30			2
' the application will then be re-determined taking account of the findings in the judgement			0
