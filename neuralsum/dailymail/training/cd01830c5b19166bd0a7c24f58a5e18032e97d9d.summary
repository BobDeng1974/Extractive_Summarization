by @entity0 @entity1 : 19:46 est , 11 december 2013 @entity2 : 20:00 est , 11 december 2013 leaving @entity3 in hospital at the end of visiting hours was like being wrenched from a terrified child			1
this warm , capable , intelligent woman - a former domestic science teacher - had borne years of living with terminal cancer with stoicism and dignity			1
but two dreadful weeks on a hectic hospital ward had reduced her to a confused and anguished wreck			2
even now , it 's almost unbearable to recall my mother gasping inconsolably down the phone : ' you have to come , you have to come			2
' or her pinched , pleading looks each time my hospital visits came to an end			1
if those had been my last memories of @entity3 , i do n't know how i would have coped			2
so many people do die like this - but our family was lucky , because @entity3 was able to move into a @entity28 hospice			1
memories : @entity31 with daughter @entity0 on her wedding day , they had time to reminisce in her final days our lovely mum , @entity33 , passed away aged 77 more than a year ago , and the loss is still raw			1
but when dark moments of grief threaten to take hold , i remind myself how the last two weeks of her life , thanks to the hospice , were among the happiest times we 'd ever shared together			1
it sounds bizarre , i know			2
but free from anguish , no longer distracted by pain , and cocooned in a place where she felt safe and secure , @entity3 was extraordinarily content - even though her life was ebbing away			2
it meant we could make every last moment together really count			2
i remember sitting in her cosy hospice room one warm afternoon , sunlight streaming through the open window , as , together with my older sister @entity53 , we pored over old family photos			1
how we rocked with laughter at the sight of @entity57 sporting some ridiculously baggy striped shorts on a holiday to @entity60 in the @entity61			2
and could that be @entity53 and me , aged four and seven , trussed up in matching purple dungarees ? mum was extraordinarily content - even though her life was ebbing away			1
it meant we could make every last moment together really count mum was n't afraid of dying			2
she 'd been facing her mortality since the breast cancer she 'd been diagnosed with in 1991 , when she was 56 , had returned ten years later with a vengeance			1
her original cancer in her right breast had been treated with a lumpectomy - but now she had secondary cancer through both breasts and in her chest			1
despite a double mastectomy and chemotherapy , the cancer was too hard to control and within a matter of months of that diagnosis in 2001 , @entity3 was given four to 18 months to live			1
we were left reeling - we were such a close family , how would we cope with losing @entity3 ? but she never complained and accepted the prognosis with great courage , only to confound such predictions by living for another 11 years			1
missed : @entity0 and her sister with their parents on their golden wedding anniversary in a speech at my parents ' golden wedding party in 2009 , i jokingly castigated @entity3 for the fact that both my sister and i had rushed to get married when she had first been diagnosed - and , three grandchildren later , she still was here			1
during ever - shortening periods of remission - sometimes as short as 18 months - she and my dad , @entity99 , a retired bank manager who is now 78 , would seize life by the throat , taking trips to @entity103 and @entity104			2
she was treated like an individual by nurses who were enduringly friendly and patient @entity3 had no intention of going quietly			2
when , in a cruel twist of fate , @entity57 was diagnosed with early stage @entity109 's six years ago , she insisted she would look after him at home - which she did			2
but in april last year , as the cancer pushed relentlessly inwards towards @entity3 's ribs and lungs , she had to give up caring for @entity57 and he was moved into respite care			1
meanwhile , her doctors admitted that any further surgery would be risky and futile			2
even then she did n't weep or sink into despair , insisting we all carry on as normal			2
then , at the beginning of september , @entity3 was rushed to hospital with severe breathlessness			2
the cancer was causing her lungs to fill with fluid , and though doctors managed to drain this away , within a day or so her lungs had filled up again			1
again they were drained , only to refill			2
the cycle repeated itself two or three times , over several days , until one evening , after my sister and i had left the hospital , @entity3 ’s doctors told her there was no point in repeating the procedure as her lungs were simply going to fill up again			1
they were telling her there was nothing more they could do , yet they delivered the words without any compassion or empathy			2
invaluable support : @entity0 will always be grateful to @entity28 staff i hate to think of her hearing those chilling words alone			1
she was given an oxygen tank to relieve the breathing difficulty , and that was that			2
the end of the road			0
frightened and isolated , she immediately called me , sobbing so bitterly i could n't understand a word she was saying			0
i raced back to the hospital only to find @entity3 - my quiet , strong , stoic and determined mother - crying and shaking like a terrified child			0
a nurse had given her a sedative and tried to explain to me what little she knew			0
it was three hours before a doctor came to explain @entity3 's medical situation , but in terms of morale and anxiety , the damage had been done - for all of us			0
over the course of the next two weeks , @entity3 's situation at the hospital just seemed to go from bad to worse			0
@entity53 and i visited every day , but we seemed to spend most of our time trying to track down nurses to tell them @entity3 was in pain or that her bedding needed changing because her sheets were damp with sweat			1
her basic physical needs were addressed , but the total lack of compassion and communication was so upsetting			0
it was clear that @entity3 felt utterly confused , lost			0
no one ever consulted her , no one told her what to expect or how long she would be there for			0
matters came to a head when an elderly woman with severe breathing problems was installed in a bed directly opposite @entity3			0
the lady 's family kept a constant vigil since it was clear she did n’t have long to live			1
mum could hear every cough , gasp and dying breath			0
she had no choice but to be a captive audience to this unfolding tragedy			0
she had to watch this woman pass away			0
it was then my sister and i knew we had to get her out of there			0
@entity3 insisted she wanted to die at home , a short drive away in @entity209 , @entity210 , but in her advanced state of ill health , this was n't possible			0
in the meantime , the palliative care team contacted @entity216 in @entity217 , @entity218 , who readily agreed to take her			0
i admit i was very nervous about what the hospice would be like , terrified that @entity3 would find it a morbid and frightening place filled with dying people			1
women at risk breast cancer is the most common cancer in the @entity228			1
around 55,000 women are diagnosed each year but as soon as we arrived , it was clear my fears had been entirely misplaced			0
the staff insisted @entity53 and i have a cup of tea while nurses gently led @entity3 away so they could settle her in a lovely room - her own room - overlooking the gardens			1
they spent time talking about how she felt , what pain relief she needed			1
it created a template for those last couple of weeks of her life in which @entity3 finally felt she had regained control			0
she was treated like an individual by nurses who were enduringly friendly and patient			0
@entity53 and i could come and go as we pleased			0
i ’d often pop in with my two daughters , @entity252 , nine , and @entity253 , five , on the way to school			0
@entity3 loved it when the girls came running in to bring @entity258 her morning paper			0
the girls loved it , too : they 'd been frightened by what they 'd seen on the hospital ward , and had to be cajoled a little into going to the hospice			1
but after seeing how different it was , they were only too happy to go again			0
meanwhile , we adults rarely acknowledged the great unsaid : @entity3 was dying - we were going to lose her all too soon			0
the warmth and peacefulness of the hospice stripped us of any morbid thoughts			1
instead , we talked and reminisced			0
the only time @entity3 got agitated was discussing @entity57 - he was now in a home , but we reassured her he was in good hands			1
she also made it clear she no longer wanted to go home			1
she wanted to stay in the hospice until she died			1
once she was there she seemed almost to ' bounce back ' - her pain was better controlled , and she slept well thanks to the peace and quiet			0
thanks to such new - found serenity , we developed a new , though all too brief , routine of just spending quality time talking to @entity3			1
she was especially thrilled when i told her i was doing a sponsored 10km walk in aid of the hospice and had raised nearly £ 3,000			1
she died on a bright sunday morning on the last day of september			0
it was early , around 8am when i got the call			0
@entity3 had fallen trying to get out of bed - independent to the last - and though not injured , once safely and comfortably back under the covers , she simply took a long , peaceful breath and slipped away			0
when @entity53 and i got to the hospice , we found @entity3 serenely laid out in bed , two fresh flowers on her pillow , her hands tucked under the sheets and wrapped around a little wooden cross			1
it was a beautiful , comforting sight			0
and so , as i come to terms with losing my mum , i carry those precious two weeks of hospice care with me			1
i think of her sitting peacefully in her chair , doing the crossword , watching television , tucking into a hearty casserole or delicious fruit crumble			0
i 'm just so glad that despite all this she managed to reclaim the peace and control she so badly craved before she died			0
it ’s the very least any of us can hope for			0
