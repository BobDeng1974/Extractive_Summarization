by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor incentive : @entity3 has said unemployed @entity4 are starting to take jobs that would normally be filled by immigrant workers thanks to benefits reforms unemployed @entity4 are being made to take jobs currently filled chiefly by immigrant workers thanks to sweeping reforms of the benefits system , @entity3 has said			1
the work and pensions secretary @entity3 said pilot schemes of the government ’s new universal credit – which is replacing six different out of work benefits and tax credits – suggested claimants are increasingly moving into seasonal , short - term or part - time work			1
employers have long found people on benefits unwilling to accept such jobs , since they risk losing tax credits , housing benefit or other handouts for positions that may not be secure , and turned to foreign workers			0
but mr @entity3 said universal credit , which guarantees that claimants are always better off working , even part - time , was creating a new market in ‘ mini-jobs ’ for the @entity4 unemployed			1
‘ under universal credit , there is always an incentive to do more hours , ’ the @entity3 said			1
‘ it makes it more viable to employ a @entity4 citizen			2
they are more flexible than they ever would have been before			0
employers do n’t need to get somebody from somewhere else			0
’ mr @entity3 revealed that as universal credit is rolled out across the country , he plans to impose new conditions on those working part - time to push them to do more			1
he is planning an extension of sanctions that will affect people currently claiming tax credits and other benefits which see the state top up income			0
in - work claimants will be challenged to take on more hours or face a sliding scale of cuts to their income			1
‘ the single most important thing are the in - work allowances in universal credit			1
at the moment , the adviser stops seeing you the moment you get into work because you just go into the tax credit system , ’ mr @entity3 said			1
‘ now the adviser will stay with you until you break free of the benefits system altogether			0
we will be introducing in - work conditionality			2
there will be a certain point where somebody who has been doing part - time work , we can say “ we think in your circumstances you could do at least another five hours a week , let ’s find that ”			1
’ mr @entity3 was speaking to the @entity1 as he prepared to announce the latest phase of universal credit , which is the biggest change to social security since 1945			1
scheme : mr @entity3 said universal credit , which guarantees claimants are better off working , was creating a new market in ' mini-jobs ' for the unemployed the service , which is already available in ten pilot areas across @entity88 , @entity89 and @entity90 , is to be rolled out across the first entire region , the @entity92 , from monday			1
in total 90 jobcentres , or one in eight in @entity4 , will offer the new benefit			2
mr @entity3 has designed the new system chiefly so that claimants will benefit from better work incentives			1
people are able to move in and out of work more smoothly , he says , and jobcentres get instant access to @entity103 earnings data so they can make sure people are receiving the right amount of support and eliminate fraud			0
claimants have to sign a new commitment which sets out what is expected of them in return for payments , and sanctions – including withdrawal of universal credit – that will be introduced if they fall short			1
‘ it ’s a claimant commitment – a kind of contract			0
it looks at an individual , requires them to have a cv , be available , attend interviews , take a job if it ’s offered , and if you do n’t do that this is what will happen , ’ mr @entity3 said			2
‘ for the first time ever , it ’s like a contract of work			2
we are already seeing a significant change of attitude			0
it focuses the mind , it makes people think about work			0
‘ by simplifying the mess of benefits and tax credits we inherited , and by improving work incentives , we are ending the something - for - nothing culture			2
‘ for too long , jobseeker 's allowance and tax credits stopped acting as a way of supporting people to get into work and rebuilding their lives in bad times			0
instead benefits became a trap			0
‘ it ’s morally right that we break this trap and we take action against a culture of entrenched dependency			0
we must stop a benefits system that only reinforces hardship			0
‘ it is absurd that a situation could exist where a lone parent or low paid worker had to think twice about accepting more hours at work because the increase in wages would be minimal			0
the state was providing a very real disincentive to work			0
‘ @entity170 credit is about fundamentally changing the relationship between claimants and the state			2
we are seeing claimants spending more time looking for jobs and moving smoothly into employment safe in the knowledge that it will always pay more to be in work			1
’ mr @entity3 dismissed @entity180 criticism of the scheme , which it supports in principle but has been dogged with it design faults , leading to successive delays			1
‘ we ’ve changed the way anyone will ever roll out a big it regime again			0
yes , it ’s a bit slower , but it ’s a damn sight safer , ’ mr @entity3 said .			2
