' if @entity9 enters @entity13 , the city will become their base within three months			1
' the @entity30 government has confirmed that @entity9 fighters have been crossing from @entity30 into @entity2 to carry out attacks on government forces			1
and @entity34 director of national intelligence @entity35 admitted recently that he believes @entity9 might well be responsible for a string of recent suicide bombings in @entity2			1
testifying before the @entity39 , mr @entity35 said the blasts in @entity2 cities since last december ' had all the earmarks of an @entity9 - like attack '			1
he added : ' we believe @entity9 in @entity30 is extending its reach into @entity2			1

rebel commander @entity10 has warned that if @entity9 enter the city it will become their base within three months @entity2 's opposition has frequently called on a divided and deadlocked international community to act to halt president @entity7 's campaign of repression against a peaceful uprising that is now an armed insurgency			1
it is pushing for the establishment of a no - fly zone similar to the one the @entity66 authorised for @entity67 last year , or the channelling of weapons to the poorly equipped rebel @entity21			0
but the @entity21 remains massively outweighed by the regular army			0
' may @entity71 help us because it is impossible to defeat this regime , ' said @entity10			0
' they have chemical weapons they will possibly use			0
' they have tanks , planes , mortars , rockets and we have nothing			0
' we want them to give us weapons to defend ourselves or to intervene militarily			0
the @entity2 people still like the @entity88 countries , but if it continues like this , you end up hating them			2
' experts have repeatedly warned that the uprising could take on an increasingly radical flavour , if calls for assistance went unheeded			0

the @entity30 government has confirmed that @entity9 fighters have been crossing from @entity30 into @entity2 to carry out attacks on government forces @entity2 children play near a destroyed tank in the town of @entity112 on the outskirts of @entity13			1
rebels fear government forces may begin to use chemical weapons in recent months , reports of foreign jihadists flocking to @entity2 via its porous border with @entity120 have raised alarm , although fighters and analysts say there is no big @entity9 presence yet			1
however , a @entity127 report last month said the @entity30 branch was believed to be extending its reach into @entity2 to try to exploit the uprising			2
the number of @entity9 fighters in @entity2 was believed to be small , @entity127 coordinator for counterterrorism , @entity131 , said			1
' but there is a larger group of foreign fighters , many of whom are not directly affiliated with @entity9 , who are either in or headed to @entity2			1
and clearly , this is a matter of concern for all who fear greater violence in @entity2 and for regional stability			2
' an @entity146 journalist in @entity13 said last month he saw foreign fighters who claimed to hail from countries as varied as @entity149 , @entity150 , @entity151 and @entity152 come to join @entity2 rebel group , the @entity153			1
another reporter said he saw fighters from a number of @entity158 countries including @entity159 at a border crossing between @entity120 and northern @entity2			2
director of national intelligence @entity35 , centre , said he believes @entity9 is behind a string of recent suicide bombings in @entity2 ' why does n't the government of your country do anything to help us ? ' @entity170 , a fighter with the martyrs of @entity172 in the rebel - held @entity13 district of @entity175 , pleaded with an @entity146 photographer			1
' in @entity67 , they helped get rid of ( now slain dictator @entity178 ) @entity179 , but here in @entity2 they leave us to die			0
' analysts said there were already several splinter groups on the ground who employ the same methods as @entity9			0
fears of @entity30 - style violence multiplied in may when twin suicide bombings in @entity191 killed at least 55 people and wounded several hundred - the deadliest attacks since the uprising erupted in march 2011			1
@entity195 , an @entity196 group unknown before the revolt , claimed responsibility for the bombings as well as previous attacks in @entity191 and @entity13			2
@entity201 , which has long accused @entity191 of turning a blind eye to extremists crossing through into @entity30 , has refused to supply arms to the rebels , lest they fall into the hands of @entity9			2
in february , when @entity9 leader @entity208 openly expressed support for the @entity2 revolt , rebel groups rejected his statement as ' interference			1
' from the start of the uprising , @entity7 's regime has claimed to be fighting a foreign - planted , @entity196 insurgency led by ' armed terrorist groups			0
' though activists have frequently mocked the regime 's discourse , they also sense the emergence of radical groups whose agenda is not freedom and democracy , but the establishment of an @entity229 state			0
the majority of @entity2 's population is @entity232 , but the country is led by the @entity235 clan			0
members of the @entity237 - an offshoot of @entity239 - are considered by radical islamists as apostates			0
though many rebels may not share this view , there are growing signs that they may be willing to make a pact with even the most radical groups to bring @entity7 down			0
' the main aim is to stop this bloodshed in @entity13			0
if neither the @entity251 nor the @entity158 will help us , we will ask for the help of @entity9 to stop the bloodshed , ' said @entity254 , an anti-regime activist in @entity13 , who said @entity9 's possible presence would not mean that they would take over			2
' in the end , the people of @entity13 will decide their fate , ' @entity254 told @entity146 via @entity259			0
' the people who have stood against and fought a dictator like @entity7 ... i am sure that the same people can also fight @entity9			0
