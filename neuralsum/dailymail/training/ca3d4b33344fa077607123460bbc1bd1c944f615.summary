the atmospheric photographs show models dressed in masks to look like @entity13 's sidekick @entity12 , a bear - like ' wookiee ' from the planet @entity16			1
they are the work of visionary artist @entity19 , who has created a series of images with the creatures in unlikely everyday situations			1
surreal : @entity19 's bizarre images show people dressed as @entity27 carrying out normal tasks fight : two @entity27 take each other on in this image , ' @entity31 ' threatening : the star of ' @entity33 ' gives off a sinister air as he points a shotgun at the camera wookiees are shown drinking a bars , going rollerskating and exercising in the path			1
the contrast between the normality of the models ' activities and their otherworldly garb creates a surreal effect			2
mr @entity19 , from @entity47 , @entity48 , was inspired by his childhood love of comic books and monster tales , and wanted to bring a slice of science - fiction fantasy into the world we live in			1
hard at work : another of mr @entity19 's atmospheric images is set in a workshop drowning intergalactic sorrows : a wookiee in a bar looks lonely in ' just one more ' traveller : a wookiee sets off down the railway tracks - but it 's not as speedy as the @entity66 poignant : the images are bizarre but , in some cases such as ' @entity69 ' , strangely moving the 32 - year - old , an art director at a design firm , began the project two and a half years ago , and uses his friends as the masked models			1

fantasy : the artist was inspired by his childhood love of comic books and monster stories wholesome : one of the models agreed to work out in a park while wearing the @entity27 mask violent : like the fictional characters , these @entity27 seem to possess immense power @entity98 : the staring eyes of the mask make this photograph , ' @entity102 ' , a haunting image ' i usually start with an idea that i begin sketching out , storyboarding each frame from the shoot and figuring out lighting			1
' next , i start roughing out my shots , location scouting , and getting together wardrobe and props			0
then on the day of the shoot , everything changes and half the shoot is improvised , which is all the fun			0
' i have always been intrigued by masks			2
they hide the person behind , but also bring forth pieces of them that at first glance were shadowed by their expressions			0
' @entity124 : ' @entity123 ' has a theatrical and dramatic quality to the set - up @entity124 : ' @entity123 ' has a theatrical and dramatic quality to the set - up icon : the original wookiee , @entity12 , is pictured with @entity13 ( @entity130 ) in @entity3			0
