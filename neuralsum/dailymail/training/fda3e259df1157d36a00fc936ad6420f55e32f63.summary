while security has tightened at the @entity3 border , drug smugglers are increasingly turning to the high seas			1
the area where boats were seized off @entity7 and the northwest coast of @entity9 tripled to a size comparable to the state of @entity12 during the 2013 fiscal year , which ended in september			1
off @entity15 , traffickers over the years have been traversing territory so big the continental @entity3 could be dropped inside of it			0
@entity9 's @entity18 has been loading marijuana bales onto 50 - foot vessels as far south as the @entity9 port of @entity22 - where its leader , @entity24 ' @entity23 , was captured early saturday - and running them up the @entity25 to the @entity3 , deep into @entity7			1
it 's unclear if @entity23 's arrest will hinder the maritime runs			0
undermanned : the @entity29 has been hobbled by budget cuts , even as the amount of drugs being traffics by sea surges meanwhile , budget cuts have hit one of the lead @entity3 law enforcement agencies on international waters - the @entity29 , the only @entity3 military service able to make drug arrests hundreds of miles offshore			1
to meet automatic federal budget cuts , it reduced its operating costs by 25 percent in 2013			1
it also lost help from @entity47 ships on drug missions off @entity49 that were decommissioned and not replaced because of cutbacks , or sent elsewhere because of @entity52 's new military focus			1
as such , only a third of suspected drug smuggling boats or aircraft out of @entity15 that were tracked by @entity3 intelligence in cocaine - trafficking corridors in the @entity25 and @entity59 were stopped last year , the @entity29 's top officer , admiral @entity53 , told @entity60			1
' our interdictions are down 30 percent from the year before , when we had more assets out there , so that 's an indicator to me that as soon as we start pulling assets away , they 're running more drugs and they 're getting through , ' @entity53 said			2
@entity3 authorities stopped some 194,000 pounds of cocaine last fiscal year - more than 40,000 pounds less than in 2012 , according to @entity29 statistics			2
marijuana seizures dipped between 2012 and 2013 from 124,000 pounds to 81,000 pounds			2
this photo taken jan. 28 , 2014 , shows the crew of a 45 - foot @entity29 patrol boat runs through their pre-departure briefing in @entity79 harbor defense officials have warned the cuts would hamper efforts to reach the president 's goal of intercepting 40 percent of the illicit drug shipments flowing into the region by 2015			1
fighting drug traffickers at sea is crucial because small aircraft used by traffickers can only carry about a ton of drugs versus large boats that can cart up to 20 tons of cocaine or more , authorities said			1
as much as 20 percent of the cocaine moving through @entity15 ends up in the @entity3			0
large amounts also travel across the ocean into @entity99 , providing funding for insurgents and drug traffickers , and then on up into @entity103			2
' we 've had to cut back in hours and funding , and cut back on resources on the water , ' said commander @entity107 , deputy chief of law enforcement for the 11th district , which stretches from @entity110 to @entity111			0
' @entity114 's aircraft and ships have cut back on fuel , so every hour we 're not in the air or on the water , it does leave a gap			2
' even so , sea smuggling has not grabbed the attention of lawmakers like the flow of illegal goods across the land border , where billions have been spent on beefing up security			0
part of the reason is the challenge to patrolling the ocean			0
this photo taken jan. 28 , 2014 , shows lieutenant commander @entity132 , the @entity132 chief of enforcement for the @entity79 sector with more than 42,000 active - duty members , the @entity29 is assisted in the drug war by other @entity3 agencies			1
it works closely with other nations , but that help only goes so far			0
bilateral treaties sometimes limit waters it can patrol , and some of the foreign navies are small and underequipped			0
@entity3 officials , for instance , can not venture into @entity9 waters without prior permission and will stop a chase and alert @entity9 authorities if suspected boats cross into that territory			1
treaties with nations such as @entity154 allow @entity3 authorities more latitude			0
' the land border is a much simpler border to defend			0
you can put up fences			0
you can put people out there			0
but it 's a finite area			0
you know where your land starts and where it ends , ' @entity53 said			0
' when you go out into the maritime , it 's huge			0
' the @entity29 oversees 95,000 miles of coastline and 4.5 million square miles of maritime territory where the @entity3 has rights : ' we do n't have that many ships , and we do n't have that many aircraft , so there are many different places and routes that the bad guys can take to try and get around us			1
' rear admiral @entity180 , the 11th @entity181 commander , said the tiny @entity29 is doing its best to optimize its resources but the challenge is ' like a police cruiser in @entity185 responding to something in @entity187			2
' off @entity7 , smuggling vessels are typically spotted by planes from the @entity29 or a federal agency , such as @entity191 , @entity192 or the @entity193			1
@entity29 or @entity191 boats are then called to board suspicious vessels			2
@entity197 officers are prohibited from firing on boats off the @entity3 coast unless the pursuit begins within 12 miles of shore			0
the @entity29 has no such constraints , so the onus has fallen on it as smugglers have ventured farther offshore			1
the @entity18 has been loading marijuana bales vessels as far south as the @entity9 port of @entity22 and running them up northern @entity7 after taking control of that state 's coastal territory several years ago , said @entity210 , @entity212 's assistant special agent in charge of investigations in @entity79			2
@entity215 officer @entity215 communicates on the radio while steering the 45 foot @entity29 vessel through a dense fog during a patrol off the @entity79 coast smugglers driving three - engine boats have been landing along remote coasts of @entity224 , reaching as far as the beach town of @entity226 , which is about 350 nautical miles from the border city of @entity79			1
that 's a shift from the one - engine drug skiffs seen landing for years in @entity230			2
support vessels carry fuel and supplies to go longer distances , and smugglers transfer loads onto @entity3 - owned pleasure craft , believing they are less likely to raise suspicion than a foreign boat			0
last month , a @entity29 c - 130 plane circled 200 feet over drug runners who jettisoned plastic - wrapped marijuana bales off @entity9 's @entity7 coast , about 175 miles south of the @entity3 border			1
a @entity29 inflatable boat closed in each time the three - engine vessel switched fuel tanks , according to lt. @entity246 , who monitored the hour - long , 30 - mph chase from a nearby cutter			2
by the time the four men were arrested , there were no drugs on board , but the @entity29 fished 3,500 pounds of marijuana and 34 pounds of methamphetamine from the ocean			1
@entity53 , speaking at a defense conference this month in @entity79 , said that the @entity29 's resources to patrol the high seas and intercept threats are " woefully inadequate at this point			1
" its aging fleet of larger cutters is being replaced with faster , more capable @entity263 , but the number of high endurance cutters best suited for the high seas has dropped from a total of twelve to eight and will remain that way			1
the service 's operating budget will return to 2012 levels this year , but future years are uncertain			0
meanwhile , demands for the @entity29 's 240 cutters , some 1,775 boats , and about 200 aircraft are expanding with the warming arctic and its emerging fisheries , cruise ship routes and commercial traffic			1
representative @entity279 , a @entity281 @entity280 , has called for an evaluation of @entity3 anti-narcotics efforts out of concern over the limited successes of the multibillion dollar war on drugs and wants more investment in prevention programs to curb the @entity3 market for illegal drugs			0
' drug traffickers continue to find new ways to circumvent our laws , ' @entity279 said			0
' unfortunately , @entity296 's draconian budget cuts have made the @entity29 's ability to collect intelligence on and interdict drug traffickers increasingly difficult			1
' in 2013 , the service lost one of its own to traffickers who rammed their 30 - foot boat into the small craft of chief petty officer @entity305 , 34 , near @entity226 off @entity306			0
@entity305 's death drove home the dangers of the war on drugs at sea , said @entity313 @entity215 , 28			0
' you never know what you are going to encounter , ' said @entity215 , his gun at his side as he looked into the gray mist hovering over the @entity25 waters on a recent evening , miles from the @entity9 border .			2

drug runners are *launching* from @entity9 and shipping tons of drugs all the way up to @entity224
the @entity29 , the agency with the best tools to stop smugglers on the high seas , has had to ground aircraft and stop cutters because of cutbacks
@entity29 reduced operating costs by *25percent* in 2013 because of the sequester
