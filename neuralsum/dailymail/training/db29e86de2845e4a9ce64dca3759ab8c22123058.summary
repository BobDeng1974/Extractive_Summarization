by @entity0 from drinking urine to nose picking , there have long been gruesome - sounding ' remedies ' with supposed health benefits			1
but would you go as far as eating a sausage containing bacteria from baby poo ? @entity11 researchers believe this could be another way to get ' healthy bacteria ' in the body			1
bacteria often found in probiotics - @entity16 and @entity17 - are found in abundance in baby poo , say @entity11 researchers they say that baby stools are an abundant source of probiotics that boost gut health - and that sausages containing it could become a health food			1
this is because many types of sausages - including pepperoni and salami - are made with the aid of bacterial fermentation , the website @entity28 reports			0
the bacteria is either naturally occurring in the raw meat or added to the meat in the manufacturing process			0
more and more evidence is showing that gut bacteria plays a crucial role in our health			2
changes to gut bacteria , that result in an imbalance between ' friendly ' and ' unfriendly ' bacteria , are associated with cancer , diabetes and inflammatory bowel disease			0
and earlier this year , researchers at the @entity54 , in @entity55 , found that having the right balance of gut bacteria could be the secret to a long life			2
probiotics are live bacteria which , when consumed , are thought to colonise the stomach with bugs that help digestion			2
their beneficial effects are not wholly proven , although there is increasing evidence they might help with a range of problems , including diarrhoea and food allergies			0
scientists cultured this bacteria and used it to ferment the @entity11 sausage fuet ( file picture )			1
they found this sausage contained enough probiotics to have health - giving benefits this includes research showing that the bacteria in the gut may ' communicate ' with the brain , improving mental health and behaviour in conditions such as anxiety , and possibly even autism and @entity93 's syndrome			1
as a result , the probtiocs industry - which revolves largely around yogurt and supplements - is booming			0
in an attempt to find other ways to incorporate probiotics into diet , @entity11 researchers theroised that probiotic bacteria could also be used in fermented sausages			1
live science contributor @entity105 reports that ' for probiotic bacteria to work , they must survive the acids in the digestive tract			0
as such , the researchers focused on microbes found alive in human faeces '			0
probiotics most commonly contain the bacteria @entity16 and @entity17 - and these are found in high levels in baby poo			1
more and more evidence is showing that gut bacteria plays a crucial role in our health , from how long we live to our state of mind so the researchers , led by @entity124 , a food microbiologist at @entity126 's @entity125 , in @entity127 , @entity11 , took stool samples from the nappies of 43 babies aged up to six months old			2
they then used bacteria cultured from the stools to make type of fermented sausage called ' fuet ' , which is similar to chorizo			2
they also made sausages using commercial probiotic strains of bacteria - but the only sausage with enough ' good ' microbes to have any beneficial effect on gut health was that made from the baby poo			1
even better , the researchers , who findings are reported in the journal @entity147 , say their creations tasted as a traditional fuet would			0
' we ate them , and they tasted very good , ' @entity124 told @entity28			0

bacteria found in probiotics - @entity16 and @entity17 - are also found in abundance in baby poo
