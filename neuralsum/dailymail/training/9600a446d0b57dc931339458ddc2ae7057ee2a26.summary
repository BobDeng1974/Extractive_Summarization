by @entity0 - jones published : 06:08 est , 14 january 2014 updated : 10:26 est , 14 january 2014 @entity3 's property map : while house prices in @entity5 and the @entity6 have continued to rise homeowners in other parts of the country are living in negative equity @entity12 prices are rising across the @entity3 but new figures reveal that homeowners in large parts of the country are still trapped in negative equity			1
the latest study from the @entity18 shows the property boom is continuing , with the average house increasing in value by 5.4 per cent over the last year to £ 248,000 , largely driven by prices surging in @entity5			1
however , the average cost of a house in other regions including the @entity26 , @entity27 and most notably @entity28 , are below their values at the time of the financial crash of 2008			1
the figures could reignite rows in the @entity35 over fears that house prices are rising too quickly , raising the prospect of a housing bubble while still leaving the poorer parts of the country worse off			1
although homeowners in every part of the @entity3 saw an annual increase in the value of their property , levels varied widely from an 11.6 spike in @entity5 where homes are now worth £ 441,000 on average to a rise of only 0.6 per cent in the @entity27			1
the cost of properties in @entity5 grew at more than double the @entity3 average and are now 18.1 per cent higher than their 2008 peak but homes in @entity28 have nearly halved in value since 2007			1
despite a rise in average house prices in the @entity26 , the official figures show that homes there are still the cheapest in the country at only £ 148,000			1
the average price of homes outside of @entity67 was much lower , with properties in @entity69 costing £ 167,000 and £ 184,000 in @entity70			1
booming market : house prices are continuing to rise according to figures published today by the @entity18 excluding @entity5 and the @entity75 , @entity3 house prices increased by 3.1 per cent in the 12 months to november 2013			1
they went up by 0.5 per cent month - on - month in november though there was a steeper rise of 1.4 per cent october			0
it marks the third time in just four months that average house prices have hit a new peak , after records were reached in both august and october last year			2
@entity83 , an associate director at estate agent @entity84 , said they had noticed a significant increase in activity in recent months with renewed confidence in the economy and more generous mortgage lending			0
' buyers in @entity5 are stretching themselves to make the most of the low interest rates and are being allowed to borrow more than we 've seen in a while , ' he said			0
' we 've seen growth is spreading out from @entity5 , but there are real extremes with places like @entity101 still well below prices from a couple of years ago			2
' capital gains : the property boom in @entity5 is continuing with the city seeing growth twice as rapid as the @entity3 average property boom : average house prices have continued to rise since the financial crash of 2008 the continued surge in the property market has led to calls for the government to increase the availability of houses with concerns growing for first - time buyers and the chance of a housing bubble			1
@entity121 , chief @entity3 and @entity123 economist at @entity124 , said the @entity18 figures ' will likely maintain concern that a housing bubble could really develop in 2014 '			2
he said : ' consequently , the decision of the @entity129 and the @entity130 to end funding for lending support for lending to households from january looks a highly sensible decision , although in itself it is unlikely to act as a major brake on housing market activity			0
' though news that house prices rises are continuing to grow will be welcome news to homeowners , there is likely to be speculation that interest rates could rise with the rate of inflation falling			2
@entity147 has played down fears that house prices are rising too fast figures published today by the @entity18 show that it has fallen to 2 per cent , meeting the target set by the @entity129			2
the prime minister welcomed the news on @entity155 , saying the growth in the economy and rising employment would ' mean more security for hard - working people '			0
@entity147 claimed the figures show the government 's economic strategy is working			0
' part of our economic plan is to control immigration and to cap welfare and you see in the inflation numbers today that the economic plan is working for people , ' he said			0
a fall in food prices , particularly lower meat and food costs , was the main factor behind the 2 per cent target being met			0
coffee , tea and cocoa were cheaper last month than they were the year before , though inflation for bread and cereals accelerated			0
games , toys and hobbies also saw price falls as @entity188 approached , with reductions in computer games made for older platforms			0
responding to today 's figures , @entity194 mp , @entity196 ’s shadow economic secretary to the treasury , argued prices are still rising faster than wages			0
" after three damaging years of flatlining , working people are on average £ 1600 a year worse off under the @entity199			2
