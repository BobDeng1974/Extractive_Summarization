by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 should be giving @entity3 no choice but to make him @entity6 ’s next captain			1
instead , the talented midfielder is watching the armband drift further and further away			2
there ’s nothing @entity6 fans want more than to see one of their own leading them out on a match day			2
because that ’s what @entity2 is : a gooner through and through			1
the next @entity16 , if you like			2
controversy : @entity2 is caught smoking while on holiday in @entity20 i 'll drink to that : jack in the pool at the party during his break in @entity27 but his recent antics in @entity20 have raised further question marks over his suitability as a future @entity6 captain			1
‘ @entity3 has to have a word with @entity23 and tell him the responsibility he has now got , ’ said former @entity33 boss @entity32			1
‘ they were talking about him being a future @entity6 captain , and a captain should n’t be acting like that			0
’ @entity32 talks from a position of strength			0
he dealt with the wayward tendencies of ex-skipper @entity16 during the early part of the @entity6 legend ’s career			0
he knows what it takes to be an @entity6 captain — on and off the pitch			0
trouble brewing ? @entity23 assured @entity3 ( left ) his last smoking episode was a ' one off ' troubled : @entity16 ( right ) battled off - field problems during his time at @entity6 it ’s important to remember , however , that smoking and drinking boisterously in public was more widely accepted in @entity16 ’ era than it is today			1
you could drink 10 pints , smoke a packet of @entity60 and get away with it in training the morning after			0
the science involved in modern day football , not to mention the frenzied media attention , means that is no longer the case			0
on the pitch , @entity2 — who is hugely self - critical of his performances — still has much to learn			1
company : @entity70 watches his @entity72 team - mate @entity71 dive into the pool he ’ll be the first to admit that			0
but it is his failure to learn away from the game that is causing @entity6 the biggest headache at the moment			0
just what impact his @entity20 jaunt has on those gruelling pre-season fitness tests when @entity2 returns to @entity84 on sunday remain to be seen			1
in reality , while smoking should n’t be condoned , a few drags on a cigarette and a few sips of champagne is unlikely to have a huge set - back on his pre-season preparations			2
but it certainly will not help , of course			0
social media has been awash with players posting videos and photographs of themselves topping up their fitness over the summer			0
speaking out : former @entity33 chief @entity32 has criticised @entity2 's behaviour when you work in an industry where finding an edge over a rival is paramount , @entity2 — and more importantly , @entity3 — knows that edge is not found at the bottom of a champagne glass			1
‘ @entity3 is the right man to deal with it , he wants a person to not only train well and eat well , but behave well , ’ continued @entity32 on @entity109 on tuesday			1
‘ after the bad publicity shots in the newspapers , somebody has got to have a word with him and i think @entity3 will do			1
‘ his career has not gone anywhere in the last 18 months			0
the papers now want any sort of publicity of players misbehaving and he has got to get his act together			0
’ having a chat : @entity72 goalkeeper @entity71 speaks to his @entity125 team - mate in the pool @entity2 , for so long heralded as the future of @entity6 and @entity125 ’s midfield , is approaching a critical season			1
the 22 - year - old was meant to be the mainstay of @entity6 ’s engine room for the next 10 years			0
he is now no longer guaranteed a starting role			0
he lost his place in the team on various occasions last season , though foot and ankle injuries did n’t help his cause			0
@entity3 will be the first admit he is now struggling to find @entity2 a regular place in his team			1
@entity143 has surpassed him as the club ’s premier central midfielder , while @entity146 , @entity147 and @entity148 were all preferred to @entity2 at different junctures last season			2
summer signing : the arrival of @entity152 could restrict @entity2 's chances this season @entity3 ’s attempts to sign either @entity155 or @entity156 this summer will make it even harder			1
@entity2 sometimes found his way into the team last season by playing on either flank , but the £ 30million capture of @entity152 , as well as the pending return to fitness of @entity164 , mean even a place out wide is no longer a certainty			2
likewise , his position in @entity169 ’s plans are no longer crystal clear			0
at one stage , @entity2 ’s position alongside @entity172 in @entity125 ’s @entity174 midfield looked set in stone			1
competition : @entity2 faces a battle for his spot for club and country but last season ’s loss of form , injuries and the emergence of @entity187 and @entity188 meant @entity2 played just 17 minutes of @entity125 ’s opening two games in @entity190 , before he was handed a start in the dead rubber against @entity193			1
like @entity3 , @entity169 will not have been amused by the pictures of his great midfield hope living it up in the gambling capital of the world			2
and , at the moment , @entity2 is gambling with his future .			2

former @entity33 chief has *blasted* @entity2 after being pictured smoking
@entity125 star has caused controversy for behaviour on holiday in @entity209
@entity2 could be in hot water with boss @entity3 after latest antics
