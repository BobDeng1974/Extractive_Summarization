@entity0 , 60 , of @entity1 , developed ' thickening ' in her left breast @entity3 is still there , just off the main street in the market town of @entity1 , @entity7			1
it 's a thriving business - the only thing missing is @entity0 herself			1
@entity11 - fulfilled a lifelong dream when she set up the business and gave it her own name , but she had to give it away six years later when she discovered she had breast cancer			2
even now , two years on , she feels the same pang about what might have been			0
and she is angry because it all seems so unnecessary			0
after the menopause @entity0 developed what she describes as a ' thickening ' in her left breast			1
after she reached 50 , like all women in the @entity26 , she was invited for routine mammograms			0
@entity0 underwent four scans between 2004 and 2012 and mentioned the problem at each , but was given a clean bill of health - wrongly			1
despite the reassurances , the patch of thickened tissue continued to prey on @entity0 's mind			1
' it was at the top , in the centre just by my chest bone and felt tender , ' recalls 60 - year - old grandmother @entity43 ' it was nothing like the pea - shaped hard lump you 're always told about , but i still worried			0
' six months after her last mammogram she went to see her gp			0
thinking he detected a swollen gland , he prescribed antibiotics			0
still unhappy , two weeks later @entity0 insisted on a referral to the breast care unit at the @entity55			2
there , an ultrasound scan detected a ' suspicious ' lesion , 5cm in diameter			0
it was diagnosed as a lobular carcinoma , which begins in the milk - producing glands			0
it turned out to be grade 3 ( a fast - growing type ) , and had spread to the lymph nodes in her armpit			1
facing chemotherapy , radiotherapy and repeated surgery - she was eventually to have a lumpectomy , mastectomy and reconstruction of her left breast as well as reduction of her right - @entity0 wanted to know why the screening process had failed her			1
she suspected her mammograms had been misread , but a report from an expert , commissioned by her solicitor , found something unexpected			0
it said the scans had been interpreted correctly			0
but the report also pointed out that @entity0 's breast density was between 50 and 75 per cent			1
' i 'd never heard of breast density , ' says @entity0 , who is married to @entity90 , 59 , a health and safety adviser			1
breast density refers to the ratio between the so - called ' dense ' and ' fatty ' tissues in the breast			2
dense tissue includes the ducts of the breast , the lobes that produce the milk or the connective tissues called collagen , explains @entity103 , of charity @entity104			2
this meant that cancer was n't visible on four mammograms , but fast - growing tumour was eventually found a report found the scans had been interpreted correctly ( posed by model ) ' the rest of the breast is made up of fatty tissue			1
' most women 's breasts are made up of between 10 to 40 per cent dense tissue			1
younger women tend to have denser breasts and the density declines with age			0
' after the menopause , some of the denser structures in the breast shrink , and overall breast density declines , ' says ms @entity103			0
but for a significant number of women , like @entity0 , that does n't happen : research from @entity104 suggests 720,0000 women over the age of 50 in the @entity26 have dense breast tissue			1
after the age of 50 , women are offered a three - yearly mammogram - a low - dose x-ray of the breast			2
yet for those with dense breast tissue , mammograms may be less useful because the images produced show fatty tissue as dark and cancerous tumours are white			1
that 's because the tumours absorb x-rays but fatty tissue does n't			2
the problem is that dense breast tissue also absorbs x-rays and therefore also shows up white			1
this could explain why @entity0 's cancer was not visible on mammograms			1
the biggest concern is that dense breasts put women at greater risk of cancer in the first place			1
' a study in 2006 confirmed something we 'd suspected for years - breast density is a strong risk factor , ' says ms @entity103			2
in @entity26 there 's hardly any information about dense breasts , says @entity0 , unlike in @entity164 women with dense breasts therefore face a double whammy - higher risk of breast cancer , but their tumours may not show up at screening			1
' it seems strange it 's not more known , ' adds ms @entity103			0
' it has n't come into the public consciousness here			0
' research suggests breast density is mainly due to inherited factors , though age , body mass index and menopause also have an influence			0
it is also thought that hormone replacement therapy ( @entity184 ) may increase breast density			0
and one long - term study of 1,319 women published in 2010 found those who consumed more calories in their 30s and 40s were more likely to have dense breast tissue in their 50s			1
though mammograms can indicate breast density , in the @entity26 it is not standard procedure to tell patients about this or offer an alternative type of screening , such as ultrasound or @entity203			0
that 's the fact that makes @entity0 really angry			2
according to @entity104 , a woman with 75 per cent breast density has a five - times higher risk of cancer			2
in fact , in @entity0 's case the radiographer did record the breast density on her notes as a ' significant finding ' , but she was never told			1
' i feel i 've done everything i should have - i mentioned lumpy breasts to my gp on many occasions , ' says @entity43 ' if i 'd known about the dense breast tissue , i would have happily paid for an ultrasound scan privately			1
' it 's a different story in the @entity164 where 19 states have passed laws compelling healthcare professionals to inform women if mammogram shows high breast density so they can consider alternative screening			2
@entity229 confirmed there is no general protocol for radiographers dealing with dense breast tissue , but that in ' some circumstances ' patients will be offered an mri as well - if they are considered high risk due to family history or genetic factors			1
however , there is hope that a new scan - digital breast tomosynthesis ( @entity243 ) - may improve screening			0
this takes multiple x-rays to create a @entity248 image			0
while research into @entity243 is ongoing , what should women do now ? the proportion of women in the @entity26 who have dense breast tissue			1
both mammograms and mri scans are capable of revealing a woman 's breast density and patients can ask for that information			2
but as ms @entity103 points out , breast density is one of many risk factors women face			0
maintaining a healthy weight , exercising and reducing alcohol intake can reduce breast cancer risk by 30 per cent			0
@entity0 is taking a hormone therapy , anastrozole , to reduce her levels of oestrogen as this can stimulate the growth of breast cancer			2
but it will be another eight years until she knows if she is free of the disease			0
for her , perhaps hardest of all is knowing she ca n't donate a kidney to her son , @entity279 , 33 , who has kidney failure			0
in 2012 , she had been found to be a perfect match and was preparing for the operation			0
however , due to her cancer she 's been told she 's not eligible until she 's been clear for five years			0
now @entity0 wants to spread the word about dense breast tissue			1
' in @entity26 there 's hardly any information about dense breasts , ' says @entity43 ' you go to the @entity164 websites and they say ' are you dense ? '			1
well i was and i felt it			0
' @entity0 in her @entity1 - based @entity3 before she was diagnosed with breast cancer			1

@entity0 , 60 , of @entity1 , developed ' thickening ' in her left breast
underwent scans from 2004 - 2012 and was given clean bill of health - wrongly
she had grade 3 cancer and faced chemotherapy , radiotherapy and surgery
dense breast tissue absorbs x-rays and shows up white
this could explain why @entity0 's cancer was not visible on 4 mammograms
but dense breasts put women at greater risk of cancer in the first place
