@entity1 , nicknamed ' @entity2 ' because of his love of lager , used a friend 's @entity16 as a weapon and drove so fast that he left one of his victims crippled for life			1
@entity22 , 41 , carried out the dangerous manoeuvre after ' losing face ' when he was ejected from the party following a row over a spilt drink			1
as guests were helping clean up outside the house at the end of the party , @entity22 began revving the car and drove towards three of them			1
@entity34 , 47 , a painter and decorator , broke both legs as the car pinned him against the lounge wall of the house			1
he has been told he may lose one or both of his legs because his injuries were so severe , and he may need a wheelchair			0
another party guest , @entity44 , was also hit by the car but escaped with only cuts and bruises after mr @entity34 managed to push her out of the way as the vehicle ploughed into him			1
@entity22 's intended target , the party 's host @entity50 , avoided the car , but the crash caused damage to the house costing £ 15,000 to repair			1
@entity58 @entity57 heard today that the incident happened after a party in the @entity62 area of the city which was attended by up to 30 people on @entity65 last year			1
during the party , an argument broke out after @entity22 , who had been drinking , accidentally spilt a drink over mr @entity50			1

' the vehicle then hit the house causing the front wall of the property to rupture and causes a hole in the wall of the house			0
' @entity22 , a father of two , managed to drive away before dumping the vehicle			2
he was traced after the registered owner of the car said he had lent it to him			0
mr @entity70 said mr @entity34 spent over two months in hospital but due to the severe nature of his injuries it was ' unlikely ' that mr @entity34 would ever walk normally again			2
in mitigation , defence counsel mr @entity108 : ' this was not a pre-meditated assault , there was a short background to this where matters progressed , he has not gone out looking for trouble			0
' but judge @entity116 , sentencing , told @entity22 : ' you were clearly in a bad mood after you were asked to leave the party			1
' you clearly lost your temper and you went to a car which was parked on the opposite side of the house			0
' there were a number of people outside tidying outside the property			0
they had nothing whatsoever to do with what had happened inside			0
' you drove the car across the road and performed a u turn , aiming towards mr @entity50 who was outside the house in between two vehicles			0
' he was just out of the way and you collided with a van and between the van and the car mr @entity34 was there			2
' damage to the front of the house is evidence of the force of the impact			2
' the judge said that mr @entity34 , a father of three , would never return to work , needed crutches and may even require a wheelchair			2
' his life has been affected in the most dramatic manner all because of your driving , ' the judge continued			0
' you used the car as a weapon to drive across the road towards people in that short space of time while intending to cause harm to mr @entity50			0
' i ’m sure you realise you could have killed someone			0
you were in a foul temper when seeking revenge or retaliation on mr @entity50			0
' @entity22 was convicted at a previous hearing of causing grievous bodily harm with intent , attempted wounding with intent and assault occasioning actual bodily harm			2
in addition to his prison sentence , he was banned from driving for eight years			1
outside court , detective constable @entity176 , of @entity177 , said : ' @entity22 left an absolute trail of devastation behind him that night - all over a spilt drink			2
' clearly his ego is so fragile that he could not take being ejected from a party and responded in the only way he could think of with shocking and totally unnecessary violence			0
' his damaged pride resulted in one man suffering truly horrific and life - changing injuries			0
