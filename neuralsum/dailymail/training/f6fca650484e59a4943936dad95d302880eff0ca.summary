by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter published : 16:41 est , 10 july 2013 updated : 09:34 est , 11 july 2013 the @entity3 has successfully landed a drone the size of a fighter jet aboard an aircraft carrier for the first time wednesday , showing the military 's capability to have a computer program perform one of the most difficult tasks a pilot is asked to do			1
the landing of the @entity17 experimental aircraft means the @entity3 can move forward with its plans to develop another unmanned aircraft that will join the fleet alongside traditional airplanes to provide around - the - clock surveillance while also possessing a strike capability			1
it also would pave the way for the @entity26 to launch unmanned aircraft without the need to obtain permission from other countries to use their bases			2
the drone landed by deploying a tailhook that caught a wire aboard the ship and brought it to a quick stop , just like normal fighter jets do			0
taking flight : the @entity17 will never be put into operational use , but it will help @entity3 officials develop future carrier - based drones the maneuver is known as an arrested landing and has previously only been done by the drone on land at @entity39			1
landing on a ship that is constantly moving while navigating through turbulent air behind the aircraft carrier is seen as a more difficult maneuver			2
‘ your grandchildren and great grandchildren and mine will be reading about this historic event in their history books			0
this is not trivial , nor is it something that came lightly , ’ said rear adm. @entity63 , the @entity3 's program executive officer for unmanned aviation and strike weapons			1
the @entity17 will never be put into operational use , but it will help @entity3 officials develop future carrier - based drones			1
those drones could begin operating by 2020 , according to @entity63			2
four companies are expected to compete for a contract to design the future unmanned aircraft , which will be awarded in @entity80 2014			2
the two experimental aircrafts that have been built for the first round of testing will be retired and placed in museums at @entity39 and at @entity85 in @entity86			0
the move to expand the capabilities of the nation 's drones comes amid growing criticism of @entity26 's use of @entity93 and @entity94 to gather intelligence and carry out lethal missile attacks against terrorists in @entity98 , @entity99 , @entity100 and @entity101			1
critics in the @entity26 and abroad have charged that drone strikes cause widespread civilian deaths and are conducted with inadequate oversight			0
still , defense analysts say drones are the future of warfare			2
the maneuver is known as an arrested landing and has previously only been done by the drone on land at @entity39 the move to expand the capabilities of the nation 's drones comes amid growing criticism of @entity26 's use of @entity93 and @entity94 to gather intelligence and carry out lethal missile attacks against terrorists in @entity98 , @entity99 , @entity100 and @entity101 the @entity17 is far bigger than the @entity117 , has three times the range and can be programmed to carry out missions with no human intervention , the @entity3 said			1
while the @entity17 is n't a stealth aircraft , it was designed with the low profile of one			0
that will help in the development of future stealth drones , which would be valuable as the military changes its focus from the @entity130 to the @entity131 , where a number of countries ' air defenses are a lot stronger than @entity99 's			0
the @entity17 has a wingspan of about 62 feet and weighs 14,000 pounds , versus nearly 49 feet and about 1,100 pounds for the @entity117			0
while predators are typically piloted via remote control by someone in the @entity26 , the @entity17 relies only on computer programs to tell it where to fly unless a human operator needs to step in			0
the @entity3 says the aircraft relies on precision gps navigation , a high - integrity network connection and advanced flight control software to guide itself			1
developed by @entity147 under a 2007 contract at a cost of $ 1.4 billion , the @entity17 is capable of carrying weapons and is designed to be the forerunner for a drone program that will provide around - the - clock intelligence , surveillance and targeting , according to the @entity3 , which has been giving updates on the project over the past few years			1
the @entity17 has a wingspan of about 62 feet and weighs 14,000 pounds , versus nearly 49 feet and about 1,100 pounds for the @entity117 ‘ it has taken several years of software development , thousands of simulated landings in high fidelity labs and many hours of flight test in the @entity39 landing pattern to prove this aircraft is up for the challenge , ’ captain @entity158 , program manager for the @entity159 wrote in a blog post			0
‘ today @entity17 is ready ! ’ the @entity17 can reach an altitude of more than 40,000 feet and has a range of more than 2,100 nautical miles , versus 675 for the @entity117			0
the @entity3 plans to show the drone can be refueled in flight , which would give it even greater range .			1

@entity3 hails the landing as a *massive* *achievement* because now they will be able to develop more unmanned drones
eventually hope to *replace* some airplanes with pilots with unmanned drones in effort to expand *bombing* and intelligence - gathering capabilities
