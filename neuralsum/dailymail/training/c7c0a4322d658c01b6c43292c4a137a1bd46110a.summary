@entity10 is facing a £ 10,000 bill after a huge sinkhole appeared overnight in her back garden @entity10 thought her daughter @entity22 , 12 , was exaggerating when she called her to say a huge black hole had appeared in the middle of their lawn			1
the 55 - year - old did n't realise the extent of the hole until she got home and peered into the void last wednesday			1
insurers say it has n't damaged @entity10 's home so they wo n't be paying her any money to fix the problem @entity10 , a radiographer at @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 , said : ' i just feel totally helpless			1
@entity22 rang me to say " mum there is a massive hole in the garden "			2
' i did n't really believe her and just thought she was going over the top			2
it is just unbelievable to think a hole that size could appear overnight and out of nowhere			2
' she added : ' i got in touch with the council but they said they could n't help because it 's my own property			1
' i then got in touch with @entity55 , my home insurance , and they said the hole is too far away from my home so they could n't help either			1
' i am just devastated			0
i spent the whole weekend crying and have been doing everything i can to try and sort it out			0
" ' structural engineer @entity63 , director of @entity64 in @entity65 , looked at the hole and is drawing up an action plan			0
he said : ' it is a naturally occurring oblique swallow hole			0
it could cost upwards of £ 10,000 to fix			0
' it is just one of those things you can not predict - a total act of @entity76			2
' they are not common but they have been known to happen in this area in the past			0
' thankfully nobody was in the garden because someone could have died			2
we have got to make it safe as soon as possible			0
' the sinkhole , which is deeper than a double - decker bus , almost swallowed her daughter 's trampoline a @entity92 spokesman added : ' under such circumstances , the reinstatement work becomes the responsibility of the owner			1
' although the council is not liable for the reinstatement work , it is happy to provide advice			0
' the owner was advised to contact her insurance company to see if her policy covers the incident			0
' our structural engineer also discussed the standard method used in the past to fill in these holes and provided the contact number of a reputable building contractor so that she could obtain a quotation			0
' a spokesman for @entity114 said : ' following a thorough investigation our engineers are confident that this sinkhole has not caused any damage to the property and poses no threat to the structure of the home , therefore it is not covered by the insurance policy			1
not another one : this sinkhole - about 16ft long and 6ft wide - led to the section being closed ' as a gesture of goodwill however , we will offer to put a fence up around the sinkhole in the interest of health and safety			1
' the motorway sinkhole appeared on the @entity134 in north @entity39 , between junction 5 near @entity136 and junction 6 south of @entity139			1
the hole - about 16ft long and 6ft wide - led to the section being closed from early yesterday afternoon , leading to big tailbacks on routes leading to and from the @entity39 coast			2
the @entity145 ( @entity145 ) said work was continuing to find out what caused the hole to open and that the section remained closed for safety reasons			0
the @entity145 added that the site had been monitored overnight , while equipment and materials were being organised and deployed to the site ready for the agency ’s contractors to start work as soon as it is safe to do so			0
