authorities are preparing for possible race riots if a white police officer who shot dead a black teenager is not indicted on murder charges			1
a grand jury is expected to decide next month whether to bring criminal charges against police officer @entity7 , who shot @entity8 , 18 , on august 9 in @entity9 , @entity10			1
police officers in @entity10 are meeting almost daily leading up to that decision to ready themselves for all possible scenarios , while also talking with other major police departments around the country			2
in differing accounts , police have said @entity8 struggled with @entity7 , 28 , before the fatal shots were fired , but some witnesses say @entity8 held up his hands and was surrendering when he was shot multiple times in the head and chest			1
if charges are not brought against @entity7 , police fear an outbreak of violence not just in the @entity38 suburb of @entity9 , but across the greater metropolitan area and even in other @entity41 cities , according to @entity38 police chief @entity42 and others involved in the planning meetings			1
@entity45 , the @entity9 mayor who has attended the meetings , said the concern is that ' the unrest is going to be far beyond the city of @entity9			0
' protesters and civil rights groups say @entity8 's death is part of a national epidemic in which a disproportionately high number of unarmed black men are fatally shot by white police officers , an allegation police deny			2
@entity60 riots : protests , like the one above in @entity9 on october 4 , could turn into riots around the nation and in major cities like @entity66 and @entity67 if @entity7 is not indicted , officers believe @entity10 law enforcement officials have been in contact with police chiefs in @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity71 and other jurisdictions as they prepare for the grand jury decision			1
of the 227 people arrested between august 10 and september 9 in connection with protests over @entity8 's death , 36 were from outside @entity10 , including seven from @entity67 , 12 from @entity77 and five from @entity78 , according to arrest records provided by the @entity38 county police			1
one focus of the meetings has been on how to respond in the event of riots , the police chief said			0
police faced a public backlash when they initially deployed armored carriers and carried military - style assault rifles after @entity8 's shooting			2
representatives of the @entity92 , @entity93 , @entity38 city police and @entity9 police have been attending the meetings , @entity42 said			0
the top @entity23 official in @entity38 , agent @entity98 , attended a strategy meeting last week , said @entity38 @entity23 spokeswoman @entity100			0
it was announced last week that the @entity93 will take the lead from the tiny @entity9 force in patrolling the city 's streets			0
the contingency planning comes as black and white residents of @entity9 brace for the grand jury decision			2
the nine white and three black jurors have heard evidence from dozens of witnesses , including @entity7 , who has been under police protection at an undisclosed location since the shooting , said @entity117 , the chief @entity38 county prosecutor overseeing the grand jury proceedings			1
jail : protesters can be seen above leaving a @entity10 jail , where 227 people were arrested in connection with protesting @entity8 's death between august 10 and september 9 - 36 of whom were from outside the state many @entity127 in @entity9 seem to have little faith in the grand jury process and expect @entity7 will not be charged			1
it is rare for a @entity41 police officer to face criminal charges after shooting a citizen in the line of duty			2
' i do believe if @entity7 is not indicted you will see a lot of carnage ... there is a lot of explosive energy , ' said @entity143 , one of the protest leaders			0
at a rally held by @entity148 in a @entity9 church last week , eight members of the @entity146 , a black political group , provided security			0
' we are tired of dead bodies in our community , ' @entity152 - @entity151 , an advisor to the @entity146 , shouted at the audience			0
