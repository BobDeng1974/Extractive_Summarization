by @entity0 pancreatic cancer is expected to become the second most common cause of cancer - related death in the @entity5 in 2020 , overtaking deaths from breast and colon cancers , according to new research			1
the disease , which claimed the lives of both @entity12 and @entity13 , is set for a ' startling ' rise			1
currently , the top three causes of cancer - related death in the @entity5 are lung , colorectal and breast cancers			1

pancreatic cancer begins in the tissues of the pancreas â€” an organ in your abdomen that lies horizontally behind the lower part of your stomach			2
the pancreas secretes enzymes that aid digestion and hormones that help regulate the metabolism of sugars			0
pancreatic cancer often has a poor prognosis , even when diagnosed early , and spreads rapidly			2
it is seldom detected in its early stages , which is a major reason why it 's a leading cause of cancer death			1
pancreatic cancer is fourth , followed by prostate and liver cancers			1
in 2030 , lung cancer will remain the top killer , but pancreatic cancer will move to second , followed by liver cancer and colorectal cancer , according to the report from the @entity57 ( @entity57 )			1
in addition , the study reports that the number of thyroid cancer diagnoses is predicted to increase dramatically			2
by combining predicted demographic changes and changes to the incidence and death rates of specific cancers , the @entity57 was able to project numbers of diagnoses and deaths for major cancers in the @entity5 in the coming years			1
overall , it is encouraging that the cancer death rate in the @entity5 is declining each year , and the numbers of deaths caused by several major cancers such as lung , colorectal , and breast are following that trend and dropping , the researchers said			1
however , they admit the increase in pancreatic cancer numbers was shocking			0
' the projections for deaths from pancreatic and liver cancers are startling , ' said @entity86 of the @entity57 , and senior author of the paper			1
' this study is a call to action to the scientific and clinical communities , as well as the population at large , to increase attention , awareness , and ultimately progress in the fight against pancreatic cancer			0
' there are many factors that have contributed to the lack of sufficient progress in the diagnosis and treatment of pancreatic cancer , researchers say			0
historically , the disease was understudied and underfunded			0
in an effort to double pancreatic cancer survival by 2020 , the @entity57 is intensifying efforts to heighten awareness , raise funds for comprehensive private research , and advocate for dedicated federal research to advance early diagnostics , better treatments , and increase chances of survival			0
the disease also took the life of @entity119 co-founder @entity12			2
researchers say the prediction should be a call to action			0
due to these efforts , @entity123 was signed into law by president @entity126 in january 2013 , which requires the @entity128 ( @entity128 ) to develop a scientific framework to conduct and support research for recalcitrant cancers , including pancreatic and lung			2
as a result of the law , the @entity128 issued a @entity136 in february 2014			0
this report includes plans for implementation of the recommended initiatives toward making significant advances in pancreatic cancer research , diagnosis , and treatment			0
the societal burden of these particularly deadly cancer types will become greater in the coming years , and now is the time to allocate the resources and effort necessary to alleviate the suffering caused by these diseases			0
a recent report released by the @entity153 ( @entity153 ) , @entity154 in @entity5 : 2014 , predicts that cancer will become the number one killer in the @entity5 by the year 2030			0
' this further emphasizes the urgency of making progress against pancreatic cancer , and other leading cancer killers , ' added @entity86 .			0
