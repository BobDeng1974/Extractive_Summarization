photographer @entity7 , who has worked with animals for decades , photographed the rabbit as part of a special spring - themed photo shoot with newborn animals the 59 - year - old from @entity15 , @entity13 uses studio space and some unusual pairings to create the cute images			1
i 'm all ears : this @entity22 bunny with ears longer than its body was photographed by 59 - year - old @entity7 feeling sheepish : noises are used by photographer @entity7 to make the animals look at the camera puppy love : a young dog stands over a four - week - old duckling in the studio of photographer @entity7 mr @entity7 puts different animals together and cajoles them to pose as if they were a mother and young of the same species			1
he said : ‘ i use the studio because i ca n't rely on the @entity39 weather			2
i 've had to cancel shoots in the past , so using the studio and building a set means it 's one less thing to worry about			0
young love : an eight - week - old @entity46 puppy kissing a six - week - old @entity48 rabbit lend me your ears : an @entity53 rabbit sitting with shelters a chick under its enormous ears hop on board : treats are often used to encourage the animals to pose for photographs in the studio ‘ photographing any animal can be tricky and with shoots outside there is more chance of the animal escaping or being frightened by the big outdoors			1
‘ i have very good animal handlers that i use , they have lots of contacts in the animal world and tell me what 's available at any time			0
‘ the hardest part is timing , i have to get each animal at the right age , so hatching eggs to coincide with kittens or puppies can take a bit of planning			0
@entity7 said he never forces animals to anything because it would be clear they are unhappy in the photo peekaboo ! : a @entity88 peeps out from a flowerpot with a chick on each side of her @entity7 prefers to photograph younger animals because they are happy to pose and move about less @entity7 works with a variety of animals and uses treats to coax them to keep poses for the photo shoots mr @entity7 has developed techniques to help the animals settle for the photo shoots			1
he said : ‘ i 've found that the older the animal is the harder it is to get it to sit with another , when they are very young they do n't really know what 's going on			1
‘ for example a ducking will happily snuggle up to a kitten or anything else that feels cosy			0
spring chickens : strange noises are used by photographer @entity7 to make the animals look in certain directions @entity116 : younger animals are easier to put together and are happy to be photographed side by side ‘ i never force an animal to do anything , if they do n't look happy it wo n't look good in the picture so i try something else			1
‘ without giving away any trade secrets , i use sounds to attract them , they have to be soft for kittens but a little louder for puppies and others			0
‘ or a strange noise tends to get them to look at the camera			0
the adorable animals are photographed in a studio so that the shoots are not weather dependent snuggle up : a chick nestles in to the white fluffy fur of a @entity142 dwarf @entity141 baby rabbit he added : ‘ all the animals react in different ways , so it 's quite often trial and error			2
‘ i love working with any animal , wild or domestic , it 's a privilege to be able to and i hope they enjoy working with me			0
‘ many of the animals come back to the studio for several shoots and they do seem to remember what to do , little treats always help too			2
