@entity1 shooting suspect @entity0 sat quietly in court on tuesday ahead of the arduous process of jury selection for his murder trial			1
the 27 - year - old , who opened fire on a packed movie theater in @entity9 in july 2012 , killing 12 people and injuring 70 , was seen in civilian clothing for the first time since the shooting			1
as he sat in court , he had no visible restraints , though the judge had ordered him to be tethered to the floor in a way the public could n't see for the trial			0
his dark hair was neatly trimmed , and he had a medium - length curly beard and wore oval - shaped reddish glasses - a stark contrast to his earlier bright orange hair and wide eyes			0
through questionnaires , individual and group interviews , the pool will be winnowed to a handful in the weeks ahead to hear the death penalty trial that could last until october			1
the entire process is expected to take until may or june			1
jury selection was set to begin later in the day on tuesday with the first group of several hundred people filling out questionnaires			1
during a morning hearing , judge @entity56 suggested that attorneys might not have to screen all the prospective jurors before beginning to select panelists			0
he said the process could stop after a few thousand people are screened if he and both sides agree they have a large enough pool from which to choose a jury			1
on tuesday , the defense also objected to the use of a video during the trial , saying prosecutors gave it to them too late			2
the video is apparently from the jail where @entity0 is being held , but its contents have not been made public			1
heading to court : people enter the @entity31 court ahead of jury selection on tuesday morning			1
the final jury will be selected from a pool of 7,000 people - down from an initial group of 9,000 waiting : people stand in a security line at the court house ahead of the start of @entity0 ' murder trial watchful eye : a security officer looks down from the roof of the @entity92 tuesday the judge also spent about 25 minutes going over ground rules for jury selection and the trial , urging attorneys on both sides to be professional and respectful			1
' we 're going to be spending a lot of time together , ' @entity36 said			0
on trial : @entity0 , pictured in an earlier mug shot , wore civilian clothing to the court on tuesday the scope of jury selection and the trial are testaments to the logistical hurdles of trying the rare case of a mass shooter who survives his attack			1
' the public is going to get an insight into the mind of a killer who says he does n't know right from wrong , ' said @entity118 , a @entity119 - based jury consultant			2
' it is really rare			0
it just does n't usually come to this			0
' in the two and a half years years since the shooting , the case has sparked an emotionally charged debate , with @entity0 ' parents begging for a plea deal that would save his life while many survivors and family members of victims have demanded that he be put to death			2
twelve people died and 70 were injured in the attack during a midnight showing of a new @entity137 movie			1
@entity0 was arrested as he stripped off his combat gear in the parking lot of the @entity141 movie theater			1
he later pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity to multiple counts of first - degree murder and attempted murder			0
if jurors find him guilty , they must then decide whether to recommend the death penalty			0
if @entity0 is found not guilty , he would be committed indefinitely to the state mental hospital			2
defense attorneys acknowledge @entity0 was the gunman in the july 20 , 2012 , attack but say he was in the grip of a psychotic episode at the time			1
@entity157 difference : he is pictured on july 23 , 2012 , days after he allegedly opened fire on the movie theater during a midnight showing			1
his orange hair is now gone and he instead sports a curly beard under @entity1 law , defendants are not legally liable for their acts if their minds are so ' diseased ' that they can not distinguish right from wrong			2
part of the reason the case has dragged on so long is the battle over whether that standard applies to @entity0			2
few details on those arguments have been made public			0
prosecutors and defense attorneys remain under a long - running gag order , and court documents detailing the issue have stayed under seal			0
@entity0 ' sanity was evaluated by a state psychiatrist but the results were not made public			2
prosecutors objected to the findings and persuaded a judge to order a second evaluation			0
those results were contested by the defense			0
prosecutors previously rejected at least one proposed plea deal made by attorneys for @entity0 , criticizing the lawyers for publicizing the offer and calling it a ploy meant to draw the public and the judge into what should be private plea negotiations			2
survivors of the attack and family members of victims have had a long time to get ready for a trial			0
scene : balloons , crosses and flowers are placed outside the @entity9 movie theater after the shooting victims : twelve people died in the attack , including @entity212 , 18 , left , and @entity213 , six , right ' we 've all been to therapists and have talked to our families and have our support groups , so we 're prepared , ' said @entity218 , who was shot in the arm and whose friend , @entity220 , died in the attack			1
' it 's gon na be quite the journey			0
' it could take until june to find the jurors and alternates who were not biased by the widespread news coverage of the shooting			1
equally challenging will be finding jurors who were not personally affected by the attack			0
judge @entity36 called nearly nine times as many prospective jurors as were summoned in the ongoing @entity234 marathon bombing trial			0
that meant the county 's 600,000 residents had a nearly one - in - 50 chance of being selected .			0

@entity0 , 27 , is accused of opening fire on a packed movie theater in @entity9 , @entity1 in july 2012 - killing 12 and injuring 70 people
selection from a jury pool of 7,000 people began on tuesday
jurors will be rigorously screened first through questionnaires then through individual questioning that will whittle them to 100
group questioning will follow to get down to just 12 jurors and 12 alternates - a process that will take until may or june
jurors will be *warned* that they *'ll* see the *majority* of the *gruesome* photographs and video taken at the crime scene
