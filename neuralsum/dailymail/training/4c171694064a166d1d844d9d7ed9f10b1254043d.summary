by @entity1 reporter @entity2 : 08:31 est , 26 december 2013 @entity3 : 08:31 est , 26 december 2013 these hilarious photos show how everyday objects can be turned into friendly faces with the simple addition of a pair of stick - on googly eyes			2
the craze , known as ' eyebombing ' , is considered by fans to be an easy way of brightening up the world around them			1
and two visionary @entity16 designers have set up a website for eyebombers across the world to share images of themselves joining in with the craze			1
hilarious : this is an example of ' eyebombing ' , where web users attach googly eyes to everyday objects iconic : a happy face on a telescope looking from the top of the @entity29 over the rest of @entity31 festive : a christmas tree decorated with giant googly eyes to celebrate the holiday period eerie : attaching eyes to this chayote squash makes it look like a snake or deep - sea creature smiling : two @entity16 designers who set up a website dedicated to eyebombing say they want to make the world a cheerier place for all their users @entity46 has been going on for years , thanks to the comic potential of applying googly eyes to objects such as postboxes , drainpipes and bins			1
but more recently @entity54 and @entity55 decided to celebrate the practice with their site , @entity59 , whose motto is : ' humanising the world , one google eye at a time			2
' they have imposed two strict rules on wannabe eyebombers - the eyes can only be put on inanimate objects , and it must be done in a public place			2
dignified : fans say the practice shows almost any inanimate object can be turned into a face rusting : but this plug was given a new lease of life with the addition of a pair of comic eyes shock : a water pipe is transformed into an open mouth with the temporary addition of a pair of eyes open wide ! this barcode scanner is yet another candidate for the eyebombing treatment vandalism ? the founders of the eyebombing website say that because it is anonymous it is very different to graffiti what 's going on ? the comic craze has been cheering up web users for several years now while the practice may seem frivolous and silly , the website 's founders insist they have an important purpose in helping to cheer up the whole world			1
' the goal is simple - it is just to bring more chuckles , smiles and laughs to the world , ' the pair told @entity107			0
' it gives us the opportunity to create a smile in people 's very busy lives			0
' putting a smile on the face of the world : @entity55 and @entity54 are adamant that eyebombing serves a social purpose by increasing people 's general happiness crowded : but the end of a rail is just about large enough to fit a pair of googly eyes monstrous : an old ventilation grate in @entity127 is transformed into a fearsomely gaping mouth hygiene : a hand soap dispenser becomes an alarmed - looking face after an eyebombing @entity132 : an official metal tag becomes a bear 's muzzle thanks to some creative editing outside : these fire hydrants obey the rule that all eyebombings must take place in public some may compare eyebombing to graffiti , but mr @entity54 and mr @entity55 say that because it is anonymous it is far more selfless than painting your own name on the side of a building			0
' graffiti and tagging are all about you , ' they said			0
' @entity46 is only about giving something to others			0
' in addition , they insist that fans should only use removable sticky eyes , rather than gluing them on , so that they do not do any damage			0
subtle : @entity46 can often be a particularly unobtrusive form of public artwork shifty : the peculiar alignment of these googly eyes makes the plug look particularly guilty i eat your coins : this payphone becomes a gluttonous individual with the addition of a pair of eyes looking grate : another face set into a brick wall thanks to the magic of eyebombing gigantic : an unusually large pair of googly eyes was required to eyebomb this bucket over a well			1

@entity16 designers have set up website which celebrates the *internet* craze
