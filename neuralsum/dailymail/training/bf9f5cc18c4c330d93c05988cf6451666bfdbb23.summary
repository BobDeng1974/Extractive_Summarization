by @entity0 a widely used anti-clotting pill can double the risk of stroke when patients with a faulty heart rhythm first start taking it , a study has found			1
researchers believe warfarin may deactivate two naturally occurring anti-clotting proteins before its blood - thinning effects are felt			1
after 30 days , the drug halves the risk of stroke			1
although only a small number of patients are believed to be at risk , the study authors urged doctors to be vigilant			2
study : researchers believe warfarin may deactivate two naturally occurring anti-clotting proteins ( file picture ) @entity23 , originally developed as a rat poison , is the most commonly prescribed oral anti-clotting agent in the @entity25			1
scientists carrying out the new research analysed data on 70,766 adult patients diagnosed with atrial fibrillation ( @entity31 ) , which occurs when the heart pumps haphazardly instead of with a steady beat			1
@entity31 leads to blood pooling , thereby increasing the risk of clotting and strokes			0
over a 10 year period , 5,519 of the patients suffered a stroke			2
the study found during the first 30 days of treatment , warfarin increased the risk ischaemic stroke - one caused by the blockage of blood flow to the brain - by 71 per cent			1
the risk peaked on the third day after starting warfarin , when patients on the drug were more than twice as likely to have a stroke than those not treated with it			2
patients with a previous history of ischaemic stroke were 2.5 times more at risk of another stroke during the first month taking warfarin			2
stroke : anti-clotting pill can double the risk of stroke inpatients with faulty heartbeat lead researcher dr @entity67 , from @entity68 in @entity69 , said : ' there is no question that warfarin is highly effective in preventing strokes in patients with atrial fibrillation			2
thus , our finding that the initiation of warfarin may be associated with an increased risk of stroke should not deter physicians and patients from using this drug , since this likely affects a small number of patients			1
' future studies should confirm our results , and identify the small subset of patients who may be at risk			0
however , the results of our study suggest that physicians should be vigilant when initiating warfarin , particularly in the first week of use			0
' the findings , published in the @entity98 , suggested that patients with ' hypercoagulable ' states whose blood clotted easily were most at risk			0
@entity23 blocks the action of four clotting factors in the blood			0
but it also deactivates two other proteins , @entity109 , which are natural anticoagulants			0
rapid depletion of protein c in particular might lead to a temporary hypercoagulable state , said the scientists			0
co-author professor @entity114 , also from @entity68 , said : ' while these findings need to be confirmed in other settings , it would be imperative to also investigate whether the newer popular anticoagulants also carry this early risk			0
' he suggested offering an injected anti-clotting drug , heparin , to patients starting warfarin treatment to counteract the increased risk of stroke			1
