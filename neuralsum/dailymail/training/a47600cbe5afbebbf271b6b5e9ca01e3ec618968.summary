germans are often considered to be more at one with nature than us prudish @entity2			0
and now residents of the country 's third - largest city have been given the go ahead to strip off for all over sunbathing sessions in six designated spaces			1
according to a report in @entity10 the six @entity11 are located in parkland , offering privacy , but also only minutes away from the busy city centre			2
all over tan : @entity16 has introduced six @entity11 in the city for nude sunbathing the ' zones ' were introduced following the expiry of statewide laws controlling nude sunbathing last year			1
the city 's huge public park @entity22 has been a nudist hang - out since the 1960s , with it 's @entity28 ( ' beautiful meadows ' ) area being earmarked by nudist travel site naturisttravel.net as one of the must - visit places in the country			1
they say : ' from the origins of the modern - day naturist movement to naked airlines and naked hotels , a lot has been written about the @entity0 ’ fondness for taking their clothes off in public			1
for much of the population of @entity16 , it ’s almost part of their dna			0
no inhibitions : people sunbathing at the @entity50 ' whenever the sun is out , you ’ll find @entity53 of all ages , shapes and sizes catching some rays as nature intended			0
it ’s considered as much the perfect lunchtime escape from the stresses of a busy day for office workers as it a place for friends and families to gather at weekends , and the atmosphere is always convivial and laid - back			0
' this being @entity0 , there ’s no embarrassment whatsoever about the fact that everybody is naked - the park is named the @entity74 because of the original style of the horticulture , not as an ironic way of poking fun at traditional @entity80 prudery			2
' @entity82 reporter @entity81 said : ' what @entity0 does have is a strong cultural tradition that seeks to escape artifice and the pressures of city life to return to something supposedly more natural			2
seen in this light , stripping off in public is the voluntary removal of a heavy mask , a return to unvarnished honesty rather than some titter - worthy @entity95			0
places where this is allowed to happen are spaces of truce , where there is a generally observed agreement that people will spare each other physical scrutiny and appraisal			0
' clothing - optional sun - seeking has been a common practice across @entity0 since the first fully naturist beach was set up in 1920 .			1
