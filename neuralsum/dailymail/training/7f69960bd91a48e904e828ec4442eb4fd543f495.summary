the @entity0 is on a mission to save a baby girl after she fell seriously sick about 900 miles off the @entity4 coast , during a round - the - world voyage			1
@entity7 couple @entity6 and @entity8 called for help from the @entity10 on thursday , after their youngest daughter , @entity11 , fell sick			1
a team was parachuted in on thursday to get medical help to the one - year - old , but she needs to be airlifted to hospital			1
it is believed she had a relapse of salmonella poisoning - which she had suffered from before they left stranded : the family 's boat , @entity28 , is photographed by the rescue team who parachuted in on thursday rescue mission : @entity32 parachuted into the @entity33 on thursday evening to give medical aid to one - year - old @entity11 the @entity35 is due to rendezvous with the family and their 36ft sailboat @entity28 later today , or early tomorrow			1
it will then whisk @entity11 away for medical treatment			0
the dramatic rescue comes just two weeks after the @entity42 embarked on their attempt to circumnavigate the globe with their daughters , aged one and three			2
from the start , the trip had been experiencing difficulties with choppy weather causing sea sickness , but @entity11 's health soon took a turn for the worse			2
when her parents called for help earlier this week , their daughter had developed a rash , was vomiting and had diarrhea			1
the family had antibiotics on board their well - stocked boat , but they were not working on @entity11			2
rendezvous : the baby was successfully transferred to warship @entity35 , pictured sunday morning life savers : the @entity32 and @entity0 are making sure the sick toddler gets the help she needs her condition has been stabilized , but it is thought that she had contracted salmonella , and is in need of hospital assistance , @entity71 7 reported			1
four members of the @entity32 have remained on board the @entity28 with the family , to monitor the little girl			1
a spokesman for @entity81 in @entity82 , where the rescue is being coordinated , said : ' the vessel ’s remote location as well as the infant ’s urgent need for medical care necessitated the rescue			0
' the 129th pararescuemen who saved the child ’s life will remain with her until she reaches a medical facility capable of treating her conditions			0
' to make matters worse , the @entity28 had become stranded hundreds of miles off @entity96 in @entity4 , with no way to steer or communicate			0
rough seas : @entity6 and @entity19 have faced criticism over their trip - not least from their family			1
but they have defended their actions off course : the family set sail from @entity7 on march 20 but had to call for help on april 3 , 900 nautical miles of @entity4 on friday afternoon , an update was posted on the family 's @entity112 page saying that the rescue mission was underway			2
' i just got off the phone with the @entity117 in charge of this mission			0
they have got the boat running ! ' the post , made by a relative , read			0
' they have turned around and are heading to @entity96			0
there is a @entity0 ship heading to meet them			0
if anything changes with @entity11 they will med vac her out			0
' the head of the rescue mission , major @entity130 said the family had been given access to full medical back up to make sure @entity11 stays healthy			0
' we have a doctor , a flight surgeon , that 's on call right now in @entity96 , and through their sat phone they can call her in case they need anything that 's more advanced than just simple paramedic , ' he told @entity146			0
@entity147 swells in the section of ocean the family 's sailboat is in has complicated the rescue mission			0
the @entity0 ship is needed to provide a more stable platform for a helicopter to airlift @entity11 away			2
adventure : the lure of @entity157 encouraged @entity6 to set sail with his wife and two young daughters ' with the swells out there , it 's moving around a lot more so it 's not a stable platform to hoist off of , ' helicopter instructor pilot major @entity161 said			1
once the @entity28 has met the @entity35 , it will take a further 14 hours for helicopters to make the round trip to collect the young patient			1
the dramatic rescue is far from what the couple , who are experienced sailors , had anticipated when they decided to embark on a trip to the lush islands of the @entity33			1
on their blog - @entity179 - they wrote of excitedly waiting on march 20 for the right conditions before setting sail on the well - stocked boat			2
home from home : the family planned to sail around the world on @entity28 , a 36ft boat with a toddler just learning to walk , and a curious three - year - old on board , the couple knew their voyage would n't all be plain sailing , but they could never have predicted that they would be calling for help so quickly			1
in her early blog posts about the voyage @entity198 , a teacher and owner of an @entity201 baby boutique , wrote about trying to keep a constant watch on their girls , as she coped with seasickness			2
day one i can see the magic of being out to sea , but i ca n’t really taste it			0
our children keep us too grounded to enjoy the esoterics of salty breezes , gigantic swells undulating around your boat like an erotic hula dancer , and a night sky dancing with laser beams of brilliance			2
day two our foresail , stay sail , and main sail , hold fast , all strong and white , like our painted wooden mast , and i can feel their excitement to be used like this again ; they were made for blue - water sailing , and apparently , so were we			2
day @entity229 started out sh * * * * too			0
it is so hard to keep a positive outlook at sea when you feel awful			0
day six i ca n’t possibly describe the range of emotions i have felt so far : anger , joy , sickness , exhaustion , exhilaration , wonder , awe , contentment , peace			2
day eight i think this may be the stupidest thing we have ever done ... [ but ] not everyone gets to realize their dreams in life			0
day eleven when i woke up this morning my back muscles were tight from the constant rocking you ca n’t escape at night			0
day thirteen thirteen days at sea ... we are in good spirits , as good as you can be , considering			0
three days later the family contacted the @entity10 for help as well as needing space to keep their children entertained , the couple had filled the boat with supplies of cans , dried good , diapers and fresh food			1
but despite choppy conditions , the family were relishing their adventure , singing and laughing in the cabin , and showering on deck as their boat glided through the @entity33			1
on the second day of their voyage , mrs @entity8 wrote : ' it is simple things that excite a crew when out to sea ... like the turtle calmly paddling in the opposite direction as us			1
' she also described how she and her husband , who works for a financial services company , gave each other fist bumps when they first realized they could no longer see land in any direction			0
but the exotic and remote @entity33 islands where they were headed must have seemed like a distant dream when their youngest daughter fell sick			1
the romance of life at sea was replaced with a longing for modern appliances like washing machines that other families rely so heavily on			0
in one blog post , mrs @entity8 wrote : ' i think this may be the stupidest thing we have ever done , ' as she described the difficulty of trying to hand wash poopy diapers			1
the biggest trial came when @entity11 suffered illness for several days , resulting in the family calling for help from the @entity10 , the @entity310 reported			0
it is not the first time the couple have had to rechart their planned course across the @entity33			1
they have been slowly circumnavigating the world since buying their boat in 2005 and attempted a different section of the voyage when mrs @entity8 was pregnant with their second child			1
dream voyage : the family have had to cut short their planned trip across the @entity33 back on dry land : the family are heading back to shore after suffering sickness and boat problems however , a combination of morning sickness , sea sickness and a toddler in tow meant mrs @entity8 returned to shore			1
as she wrote about the experiences in @entity344 , she mused on how pleased she was to have returned to dry land , after suffering a couple of pregnancy complications which would have been difficult to handle out to sea			0
it is not clear if the family will try to embark on their @entity33 adventure again , but the lure of far - flung islands is bound to have them longing for the open ocean before long .			1
