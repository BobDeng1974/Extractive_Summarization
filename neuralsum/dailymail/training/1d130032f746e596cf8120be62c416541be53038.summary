teacher @entity1 , 40 , was due to stand in next year ’s general election , but he has now stood down amid a row over a ‘ continuous campaign ’ to oust him as the candidate			1

@entity43 , who has also resigned from his post as branch manager , said of the @entity46 : ‘ they put on these weekend retreats where they guarantee the angels will be present			2
‘ the public can be very wary of that sort of thing			0
‘ @entity2 has a prescribed list which states that no one who has been a member of the @entity57 or the @entity58 should be a member			2
‘ but when they sat down and wrote out the prescribed list , they would n’t have thought to put occultists down			0
mr @entity1 won 1,711 votes in 2010 , and may have helped liberal democrat @entity61 win the seat , which she took with a majority of just 800 over conservative @entity64			2

the @entity46 say mr @entity1 is simply ‘ not up to the job ’ - though they deny having any vendetta against his leadership			1
in return , his supporters say the @entity46 of being just the kind of ‘ fruitcakes and loonies ’ which have dogged @entity2 in its attempts to be seen as a serious party			1
resigning on tuesday evening , mr @entity1 explained : ‘ there has been a continuous campaign by people who , for some reason did n’t want me selected , to work their very hardest to oust me			1
’ he continued : ‘ it ’s got so bad that i really want to get out of it - i do n’t want to get involved in politics again			0
‘ i ’ve realised politics is a very ugly , dirty business , and i want nothing more to do with it			0
’ referring to the owners of the @entity91 and @entity92 in @entity19 , a town said to have ‘ mystic ’ properties , he said : ‘ @entity19 has many different quirky things about it , and that ’s what makes it unique and i love that			2
‘ but i do n’t think it has a place in politics , especially when you are in conversation with the @entity103			0
‘ i do n’t think i have experienced any of their [ the @entity105 ’s ] angelic healing in my career and the campaign they have against me			0
’ mr @entity1 with @entity2 leader @entity110 : his allies have pointed the finger at two ‘ oddball ’ fellow @entity2 members who run an ‘ angelic healing group ’ in the @entity18 town of @entity19 mr @entity1 has also claimed @entity2 want the @entity116 to win the seat , which is currently held by the @entity118			1

mr @entity105 said of mr @entity43 : ‘ he accused us of being part of the occult , which is ridiculous			0

we ’re stalwarts of the community in @entity19			0
’ he added : ‘ he is confused , if he thinks it is an occult he really does n’t understand what we do			0
