by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 17:30 est , 22 october 2012 updated : 06:05 est , 23 october 2012 chaos : @entity4 's plan to reform child benefit is causing problems at the @entity7 because they are struggling to explain the changes to those involved @entity4 ’s scheme to cut child benefit risks descending into chaos because the taxman is struggling to explain the complicated reforms to parents			1
@entity7 is planning to send letters to better - off taxpayers in the next few weeks to tell affected families what to do			1
the controversial changes will see households where one parent earns more than £ 50,000 no longer receiving full child benefit			2
families where a parent earns more than £ 60,000 will lose the money entirely			2
but the fiendish complexity of the reforms means that the @entity7 can not come up with a form of words that taxpayers can understand			1
letters have been scheduled to be sent since the start of the autumn			2
accountants warn of chaos because the taxman has left it far too late to implement the scheme in time for the planned january 7 launch			2
last night @entity7 said the first letters would start to be sent out from next week			1
a spokesman said they will ‘ set out the options clearly so that an informed choice can be made in time for the 7 january rule change ’			2
the reforms will require half a million people to fill in complicated self - assessment returns for the first time			1
from next year , households where one parent earns more than £ 50,000 will no longer receive the total amount of child benefit , which is worth £ 1,055 a year for one - child families			1
setting out the options : the @entity7 said that it would start sending out letters next week well ahead of the 7th january deadline those on more than £ 60,000 will not receive any at all , with the amount of benefit decreasing on a sliding scale as a person ’s salary rises between £ 50,000 and £ 60,000			1
some 1.2million families are affected			2
the new rules have been criticised for penalising stay - at - home mothers because they take into account only the highest salary in the household			1
two working parents each earning just under the limit could earn £ 100,000 together and retain the full child benefit , while a household with just one income of £ 60,000 would lose all theirs			2
‘ the letter is n’t yet ready but it should be ready to go by the end of this week , ’ said the @entity7 spokesman			1
‘ we always said it would go out in the autumn and we want to get all the details right			2
’ the @entity83 warned the @entity84 yesterday that @entity7 had left it too late to implement the scheme in time			1
family friendly ? @entity87 with daughter @entity88 @entity90 , a manager at the institute ’s tax faculty , said the ‘ ill - judged ’ policy would overburden a tax system already ‘ creaking at the seams ’			1
‘ i do n’t think it is the right time to bung in a whole bunch of people who have never had to engage with self - assessment before and be lumbering them with a tax charge that is not intuitive , ’ she said			1
she added that most people did not know the changes were coming , warning : ‘ jan 7 is not far away			0
’ @entity104 of @entity105 said : ‘ there is barely a matter of weeks to go before a radical overhaul , yet those affected know next to nothing about what is happening			0
it ’s a ridiculously complicated system that , in an era supposed to usher in “ tax simplification ” , looks set to be almost unable to be implemented			0
’ @entity115 of accountants @entity114 said : ‘ there ’s so much work involved and very little time left to get it sorted			0
‘ for example , it ’s going to be very difficult to work out what actually constitutes a family for the purposes of making these tax calculations			0
‘ how does the taxman work out what constitutes a partner , and how will it track it ? it could take at least two years for the policy to settle down			0
’ @entity131 , @entity133 ’s @entity132 spokesman , said : ‘ for hundreds of thousands of parents on middle incomes , who face losing every penny of their child benefit in just a few weeks ’ time , this is no laughing matter			0
‘ @entity87 and @entity4 ’s policy is unfair with some couples earning as much as £ 100,000 keeping all their child benefit but one - earner families on just £ 50,000 seeing theirs cut			1
‘ and the chaotic way this ill thought through policy is being implemented looks set to be yet another example of this government ’s incompetence			0
’ a @entity132 spokesman said : ‘ it is unfair to continue paying child benefit to those on high incomes and we are making the system fairer by introducing the changes			0
’ analysis by @entity161 within days around 1.2million letters need to be sent to households that will be stripped of child benefit			0
yet officials have still not drafted the all - important wording of the document or even set up a telephone help - line			1
the delay is creating enormous uncertainty for families – almost half of which will now need to fill out a self - assessment tax form			1
and concerns are growing that thousands of stay - at - home mothers , whose state pension credits depend on child benefit , will be caught out			1
when the chancellor announced the changes , his @entity132 aides insisted such parents would not lose out			0
but there is still no detail as to how this will be made to happen			0
there are also complex ‘ claw back ’ calculations to grapple with from january 7			0
where one partner earns £ 50,000 , the household must pay back 1 per cent of child benefit for every £ 100 earnt above this – up to the £ 60,000 ceiling			0
to make matters worse , the sums are based on the higher earner ’s salary – not household income			0
so , in another first , tax policy may force parents and partners to find out exactly what the other earns			0
@entity7 appears not to have anticipated fully the impact of half a million families using self - assessment forms for the first time			1
asking them to apply a tricky formula to an already complicated form is a disaster in the making			2
in particular , the definition of what actually constitutes a ‘ partner ’ – temporary or otherwise – will be contentious			0
it is even possible that a man who moves in with a woman who has three children could see himself landed with a £ 2,450 tax bill			0
the way in which families where one earner makes more than £ 60,000 can opt out of claiming child benefit is also unclear			0
the payments are currently worth £ 20.30 a week for the first child , and £ 13.40 for further @entity228 have suffered greatly at the hands of bungling @entity7 in recent years with shock tax demands , shoddy customer service and incorrect tax codes			1
all that families want is certainty			0
but with just weeks to go before child benefit is stripped away , @entity7 looks to be heading for another disaster .			1

complexity means @entity7 can not agree on form of words *taxypayer* will understand
