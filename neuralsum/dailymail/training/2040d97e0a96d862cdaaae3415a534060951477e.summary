' they are crippled in pain			2
every part of it is talking about [ the other victims ] , not their son			1

' [ @entity9 ] read the first four lines and she knew something was wrong , ' @entity15 said			1
she then clicked on his @entity69 page and found terrifying videos in which he outlined his plan to ' slaughter ' women			2
she called his father , @entity8 , from whom she is divorced			1
they realized they had to get to @entity77 as soon as possible and jumped in their cars			0

' i thought he was the loneliest person i 've ever seen in my life , ' he said			0
' he fooled everyone for a very long time			0
he was a tragic figure			0
he is in many ways a monster			0
' @entity15 's interview comes three days after he spoke to @entity109 and said that the parents were grieving more for the other victims than they were their own son			1

on one occasion , a family member called and asked officers to check on @entity1 because they were worried about his mental state			2
in his warped 141 - page manifesto , he describes the incident , saying : ' if they had demanded to search my room ... ( t ) hat would have ended everything			2
for a few horrible seconds , i thought it was all over ...			0
[ @entity150 ] he police would have searched my room , found all of my guns and weapons , along with my writings about what i plan to do with them			0

mr @entity15 said : ' they do n't place any blame on the police , because @entity1 fooled everyone , no one knew the man he was turning into			1
' he seemed a sensitive guy , there was nothing aggressive about him , there was no anger			0
no one recognizes the person portrayed in the manifesto			2
he did n’t act in that way , he was just in his own world			0
he did n’t once speak about guns			0
' if you look at the amount of therapists they took him to , it is clear he did all he could			0
he 's writing with anger , but he constantly references how they tried to make him feel better			2
