by @entity0 warning : @entity3 's status as a free - market nation is at risk from ' the forces of pessimism ' , chancellor @entity1 will claim today @entity3 's status as a free - market nation is at risk from ‘ the forces of pessimism ’ who are waging war on big business , @entity1 will claim today			1
an anti-business alliance of @entity15 and the ‘ @entity16 ’ – a reference to @entity18 – want to ‘ pull up the drawbridge and shut @entity3 off from the world ’ , the chancellor will say			1
‘ they want to constrain foreign investment in our economy , and deprive us of the @entity3 jobs that it has created in industries from car manufacturing to energy , ’ he will tell the @entity21			1
‘ they want to set prices , regulate incomes , impose rent controls , wage war on big business , demonise wealth creation , renationalise industries – and pretend that they can re-establish control over all aspects of the economy			0
‘ whether from the @entity43 or the populist @entity16 , we now see a deeply pessimistic , depressing , anti-business agenda			2
’ mr @entity1 ’s remarks are designed as a trenchant attack of the economic policies of @entity15 ’s @entity48 and @entity49 , who have unsettled business leaders with a series of 1970s - style policy proposals			1
but it is also a provocative riposte to those in his own party and @entity18 who have expressed concern about foreign take - overs – most recently the stalled @entity61 bid for @entity3 - based drugs firm @entity62			2
mr @entity1 is said to have been the leading @entity64 champion of a controversial attempt by the @entity67 giant to merge with @entity62			0
the now stalled bid was prompted at least in part by @entity3 tax breaks for businesses			0
the chancellor has repeatedly slashed the headline rate of corporation tax , despite the government ’s austerity measures , to encourage firms to invest in and move to the @entity3			2
he will tell business leaders that @entity3 has been brought ‘ back from the brink ’ and hail a ‘ real sense of optimism that is growing in @entity3 today ’			0
but he will warn that it would be a ‘ grave mistake ’ to think that repairing the economy is complete and the country can ‘ go easy and slow down ’			0
' our task to secure our country ’s economic future is not even half done			0
‘ this is a decade - long turn - around job we have embarked on – and we are determined to see it through			0
’ mr @entity1 ; s remarks are designed as a trenchant attack of the economic policies of @entity15 's @entity48 and @entity49 , who have unsettled business leaders with a series of 1970s - style policy proposals , and @entity18 leader @entity100 he will also highlight the cracks in @entity3 ’s reputation as an ‘ open , free - trading , free - market economy and a welcome home for business ’ as a growing threat to the nation ’s future prosperity			1
for all of my adult life , since the fall of the @entity112 in the year i left school , there has been a political consensus in this country that @entity3 ’s future lies as an open , market economy , ’ he will say			2
‘ since then , under governments of all political persuasions , we have championed free trade – and welcomed foreign investment – and built competitive , open markets under the supervision of robust independent regulation			1
‘ you [ @entity21 members ] know what a huge advantage it is for @entity3 that you can say that @entity3 is the most open , competitive economy in @entity133 – and that commitment to openness , independent regulation , free and competitive markets existing regardless of the political make - up of the government			1
' sadly , that consensus that we put the national economic interest first – ahead of opportunist party advantage – is under threat for the first time in 25 years			0

@entity1 will claim free market at risk from ' forces of pessimism '
he will attack an anti-business alliance of @entity15 and the ' populist right '
they want to ' pull up the drawbridge and shut @entity3 off from the world '
they also aspire to ' constrain foreign investment in economy , he will say
