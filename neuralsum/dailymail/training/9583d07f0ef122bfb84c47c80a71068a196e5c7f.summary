but now there ’s an app that translates speech into written words that show up on a smartphone , even when people are all talking at once			1
the app , called @entity13 , is the brainchild of four graduate students , who have all been affected by hearing loss in different ways			2
it translates speech into written words that show up on a smartphone , with individuals ' speech shown in different colours they are raising money on crowd funding site @entity27 to bring their app to market			1
‘ we developed @entity13 to end the professional and social exclusion caused by hearing loss			0
‘ @entity13 brings meaning to the conversation and allows the deaf person to actively engage again , ’ they claim			0
the app translates speech into words that appear on a smartphone in real - time			1
to do this , it connects to a number of phones and activates their microphones , to accurately capture what people nearby are saying			2
this diagram shows how the app connects to multiple smartphones and uses their microphones to listen and interpret the conversation , which is shown on themain user 's screen @entity13 is the first mobile app that makes group conversations between deaf and hard - of - hearing people and their hearing peers , effortless , the app 's creators claim			2

the graduates , from the @entity96 and @entity97 , have so far raised more than a fifth of their $ 25,000 ( £ 15,707 ) goal , which they will use to develop the final @entity102 version of their app , as well as an @entity105 and web version			0
a one - year subscription to the app is available to pre-order for $ 150 ( £ 94 ) and will cost $ 360 ( £ 226 ) for non-earlybirds , if the graduates reach their funding goal			1
