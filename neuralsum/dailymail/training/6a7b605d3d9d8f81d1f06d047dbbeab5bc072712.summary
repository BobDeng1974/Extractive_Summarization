published : 11:35 est , 26 february 2014 @entity1 : 17:52 est , 26 february 2014 republicans in @entity3 have been licking their chops for nine months at the prospect of grilling embattled former @entity7 official @entity6 a second time , but her lawyer says they still ca n't have their chance			1
rep. @entity11 , who chairs the @entity12 , has called @entity6 back for a second hearing on march 5 about a program that saw the @entity7 targeting tea party organizations and other right - leaning groups with intrusive questions and years - long delays when they applied for nonprofit tax - exempt status beginning in 2009			1
but in a letter to @entity11 , her attorney says she should n't have to appear because she has received death threats			0
if she does show up , he adds , she still wo n't answer questions unless she has immunity from prosecution or an order from a federal judge			0
@entity6 appeared in a committee hearing in may 2013 but refused to answer questions , invoking her @entity31 right against self - incrimination			1
but because she offered an opening statement in which she insisted ' i have not done anything wrong , ' committee members ruled that she had waived that privilege			1
but her lawyer , @entity59 , replied hours later with a letter saying he had warned committee staffers that ' calling ms. @entity6 [ as a witness ] knowing that she will assert her rights was not only improper but dangerous			1
' ' ms. @entity6 has been the subject of numerous threats on her life and safety , and on the life and safety of her family , ' he wrote			0
' i left with the staff recent evidence of those threats			0
' he added that her tune might change if she was promised she could n't face criminal charges			0
' if granted immunity , she has no choice but to testify … the essence of an order conferring immunity is that it commands her to testify , ' @entity59 told the @entity85			0
@entity6 , who retired in september with full benefits after a brief period of administration leave , is ' is uniquely positioned to provide testimony that will help the committee better understand how and why the @entity7 targeted these groups , ' @entity11 wrote			1
' the subpoena you accepted on ms. @entity6 ’s behalf remains in effect , ' he told @entity59			0
' in light of this fact , and because the committee explicitly rejected her @entity31 privilege claim , i expect her to provide answers when the hearing reconvenes			1
' the @entity12 on @entity102 has ruled that @entity6 ca n't plead the @entity31 like she did nine months ago , finding that she waived that privilege by giving a defensive opening statement more than two dozen tea party groups have responded to what they say is unfair treatment by suing the federal government @entity59 did n't respond to a message seeking comment			1
the @entity7 's practices became national news when @entity6 casually dropped information about targeting conservative groups into a question - and - answer session during a @entity117 meeting of tax administrators in early may			1
days later , an internal audit of the agency was released , showing that some tea party organizations ' tax - exempt applications were held up for as long as 30 months			1
documents released by @entity11 's committee showed that officials in @entity117 had a hand in taking over some cases from a satellite office in @entity130 , @entity131			2
more recently , an email surfaced showing that @entity6 was among several officials who discussed a program in 2011 aimed at reviewing conservative groups ' applications more closely in an ' off plan ' strategy meant to be kept out of public view			2
@entity12 chairman rep. @entity11 may have larger ambitions : he told @entity143 activists on feb. 17 to unite against @entity145 's ' imperial presidency ' the @entity145 administration has taken heat from conservatives who insist that the @entity149 had a role in the plan , which matured at the height of the 2010 election season when tea party activists were at their most vocal and effective			2
democrats in @entity3 have responded that there is no evidence anyone meant to step on conservatives ' right to freely exercise political speech			0
now the @entity7 has moved to codify the ad hoc rules that put right - wing groups in limbo , proposing a raft of new regulations to govern the future evaluation of applications for 501 ( c ) ( 4 ) tax - exempt status			1
its stated intention is to rein in overtly political activity by those applicants – including voter registration drives , candidate forums and other election - focused programs			2
federal law prohibits groups receiving tax exemptions from electioneering			1
but @entity181 say the @entity7 is playing favorites and stifling free speech , and they point to nearly 70,000 public comments submitted to the @entity185 in opposition to the plan			2
a proposal in the @entity149 , expected to pass along party lines , would force a year - long moratorium before the @entity7 could formalize its proposed rules			2
but the measure faces almost certain defeat in the @entity195 - controlled @entity194			0
more than two dozen tea party groups have sued the federal government since last summer , with the @entity198 representing most of them			0
' the decision to recall @entity6 to testify before this @entity149 panel is not only appropriate but necessary to get to the bottom of this unlawful targeting scheme , ' the group 's lead counsel , @entity199 , said wednesday			0
' the committee correctly concluded that @entity6 waived her constitutional rights to refuse to answer questions before the panel			0
we know that she is deeply involved in this targeting scheme – even involved in planning new rules to restrict free speech ... it ’s time for @entity6 to stop the stonewalling – to present the facts and to tell the truth			0

former @entity7 exempt organizations chief was forced into retirement after revealing a scheme to target right - wing groups with extra scrutiny
tax - exempt groups are forbidden from electioneering , and the @entity7 says it wants to rein in abuses of groups applying for income tax exemptions
but the vast *majority* of the groups it targeted beginning in 2009 were @entity232 organizations and other conservative applicants
the @entity12 will call her back as a witness on march 5 , but her lawyer says she 's still not talking
she pleaded the @entity31 in a 2013 hearing but the committee ruled that she forfeited the privilege by giving an opening statement
