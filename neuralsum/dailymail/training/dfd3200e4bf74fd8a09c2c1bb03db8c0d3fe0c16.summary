by @entity0 , mail online deputy political editor teachers were celebrating today after @entity3 was ousted as @entity4			1
the controversial minister was dumped from the @entity6 by @entity7 to become the government 's chief whip in the biggest shock of the reshuffle			1
teachers ' unions welcomed the surprise announcement after years of bitter antagonism against his reforms , which culminated in last week 's classroom walk out - in a dispute over pay and pensions			1
@entity22 insisted mr @entity3 would play a key role in the run up to the election and had not been demoted - but the decision to move him comes amid increasing evidence that he is ' toxic ' with voters			1
in may a poll for @entity30 found he was the most hated politician in the government			1
teachers ' unions attacked his attempts to introduce far - reaching reforms to @entity45 's schools system			2
he pushed through radical changes to exams , the curriculum , childcare , primary school testing , teachers ' pay and league tables			2
at the same time , mr @entity3 spearheaded the introduction of one of the @entity58 ' flagship education policies - free schools - and threw the doors open to allow all schools to apply to become academies			2
but his time in charge has been marked with a spate of strikes - and claims that he wants to take the education system back to the 1950s			0
just last week the @entity67 staged the latest in a series of national walkouts in a long - running bitter row over pay , pensions and conditions			2
mr @entity3 will now become ' minister for tv ' - and will tour the television studios in the run up to the next election promoting the government			1
he will also ensure the prime minister and chancellor @entity81 maintain an ' iron grip ' on the @entity58 over the crucial next nine months			2
privately educated treasury minister @entity83 , 41 , will replace mr @entity3 as @entity4			1
mr @entity3 's removal was welcomed by teaching unions - part of the educational establishment which he reportedly derided in private as ' the blob '			1
@entity88 , general secretary of the @entity67 , the largest teachers ’ union , said : ' @entity3 has clearly lost the support of the profession and parents for justifiable reasons			1
' his vision for education is simply wrong			0
his pursuit of the unnecessary and often unwanted free schools and academies programme , the use of unqualified teachers , the failure to address the school place crisis and endless ill - thought out reforms to examinations and the curriculum have been his hallmark in office			0
' @entity3 ’s search for headlines over speaking to the profession has clearly angered teachers			1
we remain in dispute over the direction of @entity79 policy , which we believe is undermining the education service			0
' we will be seeking a very early meeting with @entity83 , the incoming @entity4 , and we look forward to not only a new personality but a more conciliatory approach , one that demonstrates an improvement in policy for children , teachers and young people			0
' general secretary of the @entity128 added : ' @entity7 has belatedly realised that @entity3 's ideological drive is no substitute for measured , pragmatic reform of the education system			2
' time after time he has chased newspaper headlines rather than engage with teachers			0
' the dismantling of the structures which support schools , the antagonism which he displayed to the teaching profession and the increasing evidence of chaos in the bodies he established , in particular the @entity140 , has led @entity7 to one conclusion - @entity3 is more of a liability than an asset			1
' successful education systems value the views of the teaching profession , which @entity3 insulted when he called them ' the blob '			1
@entity150 looks forward to a more constructive relationship with his successor , @entity83			0
' the @entity4 was a lightening rod for the teaching profession 's anger over the government 's reforms @entity158 , general secretary of the @entity160 teaching union said that ms @entity161 is inheriting ' a teaching profession on the brink of a recruitment and retention crisis after an unrelenting assault on teachers ' pay , pensions and conditions and their professionalism '			2
he added : ' teachers are buckling under the pressure of increased workload and the threat of job loss , and morale is at an all - time low			0
' @entity178 , general secretary of the @entity179 was more conciliatory - praising mr @entity3 as a ' sincere and radical reformer of education '			2
but he added : ' he often failed to bring the profession with him , which sometimes meant that his reforms did not land in schools as well as they should have done			0
' his diagnosis was often right , but his prescriptions were often hard to swallow			0
' @entity188 chief sir @entity187 appeared shocked as he learnt of mr @entity3 's departure during a call - in session on @entity191			2
' i 'm surprised and shocked that this has happened			0
i 'm a great admirer of the @entity194 , i think he 's been a transformative and radical minister of education			0
' @entity3 's sacking immediately began ' trending ' on @entity195 - as one of the most talked about events in the country mr @entity3 's move to chief whip will be seen in @entity201 as a demotion from a job in which he has shown a personal passion for free schools and stringent academic standards but has met fierce opposition from teaching unions			1
as chief whip @entity3 will not be full member of @entity6 , @entity210 have confirmed			1
but the prime minister 's official spokesman this morning rejected accusations that mr @entity3 had been demoted			1
he said : ' i know that the new chief whip has been involved in planning for the reshuffle for some time			1
' what we have seen @entity3 achieve over the last four years , a series of landmark reforms in the education system			2
' now , going forward , in the run - up to the general election , the prime minister wants @entity3 , just as @entity226 , right at the heart of his government team			1
' that ’s why he has taken on the role of chief whip , and as part of that you should expect to see a great deal of @entity3 on you television and radio channels			1
' mr @entity7 also welcomed his mrs @entity161 's appointment			0
his spokesman said : ‘ he appoints the people who are right for the job and he thinks @entity83 ’s track record makes her the right person for that role			0
’ the spokesman highlighted that mrs @entity161 had championed help with childcare bills while at the @entity248			0
public sector workers - including thousands of teachers - marched across the country last week over pay , pensions and cuts in the most dramatic reshuffle of his premiership , mr @entity7 also promoted defence secretary @entity257 to replace @entity226 as foreign secretary after the surprise announcement last night that the former @entity261 leader was moving to become @entity262 before quitting as an mp next year			1
@entity264 becomes the youngest member of @entity6 at 38 after being appointed @entity266 to replace @entity267 , who ran into trouble over the failed badger cull and his handling of the winter floods , as well as antagonising green groups with his scepticism about man - made climate change			1
but @entity275 described the reshuffle as the ' massacre of the moderates ' as a host of right wingers were promoted			0
former treasury minister @entity83 was announced as the new education secretary			0
she is a privately - educated mother of one , who trained as a solicitor @entity161 completed her rapid rise to the @entity6 this morning , replacing @entity3 as @entity4			1
the @entity288 - born 41 - year - old only become an mp in 2010 - representing @entity289 in the @entity290			0
she was quickly made a junior whip before becoming a treasury minister in october and attending the @entity6 in her second role as women 's minister - a position she will keep as @entity4			1
mrs @entity161 is a trustee of the @entity296 and voted against same - sex marriage because of her faith			0
this is widely seen as the the reason mr @entity7 split the women and equalities brief last year - leading to accusations that she was the ' minister for straight women '			0
teachers celebrating mrs @entity161 's rise may be left disappointed - as she has strongly backed every single education reform pushed through by mr @entity3			2
she voted very strongly for free schools , academies and tuition fee increases			0
the @entity261 minister has also never attended state school herself - attending the exclusive £ 4,701 - a - year @entity313 in south west @entity288			0
mrs @entity161 went on to study law at @entity315 before becoming a high flying city lawyer in 1996 .			0
