@entity0 has accused @entity2 's @entity1 of elbowing him - and expressed his astonishment that referee @entity4 did not send him off			1
the @entity6 midfielder , whose @entity8 team lost 2 - 0 to @entity9 in the @entity10 last 16 on monday night was caught by @entity1 on 29 minutes			1
and though referee @entity4 appeared to see the foul , he failed to take any action			2
we know the game â€“ if you see it , act on it			0
' the ref saw it			0
he did catch me , i do n't know if it was too hard but the intention was definitely there			0
i do n't think he is a dirty player			0
everyone wants to win for his country			0
he has n't done those sort of things before so maybe it was just one of those things in the heat of the moment @entity8 were also upset at a succession of challenges on midfielder @entity54 , which resulted in the @entity56 being carried of on 59 minutes after a challenge from @entity58			1
rough and ready : @entity8 were upset on @entity61 's challenge on @entity54 during the game down and out : @entity54 was taken off on a stretcher amid fears he may have broken his ankle video @entity66 steps down ' i thought the referee did n't help us , ' said @entity0			1
' there were some heavy challenges and i think @entity54 has broken his ankle			2
challenges like this are bad but it was a 50 - 50 , he just miscaculated , he is not a dirty player			2
' @entity1 may yet find himself the subject of @entity79 disciplinary action and a ban from the quarter final on the basis of video evidence			0
but the @entity2 striker endured a difficult afternoon , being withdrawn on 62 minutes and seeing his replacement @entity86 help to change the game , as @entity9 struck with two late goals			1

@entity9 defeated @entity8 2 - 0 in their @entity10 round of 16 clash in @entity92
@entity0 *insists* @entity1 should have been sent off for elbowing
referee @entity4 saw incident but only gave @entity2 striker a warning
@entity8 also upset by challenges on @entity54 that left him with *suspected* broken ankle
