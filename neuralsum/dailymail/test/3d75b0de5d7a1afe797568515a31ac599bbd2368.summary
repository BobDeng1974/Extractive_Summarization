@entity0 are discussing the possibility of a post-season tour , a move that could upset numerous international managers			1
@entity5 did n't rule out a potential 12,000 - mile round trip to @entity7 , home of new sponsors @entity8 ,			1
no final decision has been made on a destination but if a tour goes ahead , the squad is likely to fly out on either may 28 or 29 for a two - match , week - long trip			2
@entity5 did not rule out the prospect of a 12,000 - mile round trip for a pre-season tour in @entity7 the news may concern a string of international bosses who will be relying on @entity0 players for their mid-june friendlies and qualifiers			1
for instance , @entity24 face @entity26 in a friendly on june 7 before a vital @entity29 qualifier against @entity30 on june 12			0
@entity32 , @entity33 and @entity34 , who all have @entity0 players in their squads , all have games between june 12 - 14			1
likewise , the proposed tour would also have implications for @entity0 's @entity41 contingent , including @entity42 , @entity43 and @entity44 , ahead of the @entity45 on june 11			1
@entity47 rules state that nations are entitled to players 14 days before the start of a tournament			0
it is highly likely that those players involved in the @entity45 would be given permission to miss @entity0 's post-season tour			2
@entity0 are yet to finalise plans for their pre-season as they lead the way at the top of the @entity60 @entity5 said : ' i think we 'll go on an after - season tour to play a couple of matches in some destination where people will be very enthusiastic to have the @entity60 champions , if we win it			1
' it 's something we are thinking about , a good way to celebrate			0
not a victory parade , but a trip , a week where we play a couple of matches but , at the same time , can be together without the pressure of winning every match , without the pressure and tension of the last weeks of the @entity60			2
' we can also relax and go to holidays with that good feeling			0
but we still have nine matches to play			0
' mr @entity81 and the board are talking with me			0
we want to go somewhere where people are enthusiastic to have a club like @entity0			2
' @entity7 ? i do n't know but that would make some sense			0

@entity0 are considering a pre-season tour to @entity7 this *summer*
if it goes ahead , the 12,000 - mile round trip would likely last for two weeks
but international bosses will require @entity0 players in june
