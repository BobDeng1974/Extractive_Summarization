this is the astonishing moment that @entity2 soldiers were forced to surrender during the notorious @entity3 almost a century ago			1
the image was taken in july 1916 by a soldier who defied @entity7 chiefs in the @entity8 to take secret photographs of life in the trenches			1
amateur photographer @entity13 @entity12 took candid pictures of the @entity8 when he signed up to fight in october 1915			1
the amateur photographer used a folding camera slightly bigger than a phone to capture the battle , which saw more than a million men killed self - portrait : lance corporal @entity12 ( pictured above ) , took candid images of the @entity8 when he signed up to fight in 1915			1
despite filming without permission being banned , he risked facing the court martial by capturing the scenes from the trenches during the war crossing : men sailing on the @entity32 from @entity33 to @entity34 in october 1915 sleep on the deck while others look overboard			1
the @entity38 sailed on the former @entity40 paddle steamer , empress @entity41 , and some would 've been keeping watch for @entity2 u-boats in the trenches : this rare photograph of scouts and snipers was taken by @entity48 in @entity49 during the winter of 1915/16			1
the rifle to the left of the frame has a modified cheek rest attached which would have been used to help the shooter align his eye to a telescopic sight he captured the moment the @entity18 forced the @entity2 to surrender in the bloody battle , which saw more than a million men killed			1
the soldiers can be seen on the horizon of the dramatic photograph , and the battle in @entity49 was far from over - it would last a further four months			0
the @entity68 used a folding camera , believed to be a @entity70 which was only just bigger than a smartphone , during the war before giving the photos to loved ones on his return			1
lance corporal @entity12 faced court martial if he was ever caught filming without permission - but his record now offers a testimony to life at the front			1
now , the soldier ’s photographs have been published for the first time after being found two years ago alongside a host of his personal diaries			1
his images were aired last night on @entity90 in a documentary called @entity92			0
director @entity93 said his ' unique collection of images ' give ' a window into what it was like to live , and die , on the @entity99 '			0
reading the newspaper : soldiers in the summer of 1916 at @entity102 near @entity103 in @entity104			1
a ' keep down ' sign can be seen left in the field : @entity107 , standing and smoking , was the son of a presbyterian minister at a church attended by @entity111			0
mr @entity107 was killed on july 1 , 1916			2
his body was never found and his name was only added to the @entity114 to the @entity115 last year comrades : a photograph taken at @entity118 in @entity119 in 1915 of @entity111 's friend @entity120 writing			1
historian @entity121 said the corporal would 've mainly only got his camera out in front of friends for fear of being caught by officers he added : ‘ who was this man ? how did he manage to capture these remarkable scenes from a range of sites at a time when unofficial photography was illegal on the @entity99 ? ’ the stunning photographs , which were donated to the @entity136 after the veteran died in 1977 , show the mundane life of soldiers relaxing in the trenches and travelling to @entity49 on a boat			1
and @entity111 , of @entity142 , even captured the moment the @entity18 forced @entity2 soldiers to surrender in july 1916			1
the shots have been hailed as the ‘ photographical @entity8 discovery of the century ’ by @entity104 @entity148 chief @entity147			0
portrait : @entity120 , a fellow soldier of @entity111 , is pictured with a ' @entity151 ' mortar in one of the many photographs in the collection @entity155 , head of collections for the museums of the @entity158 , said : ‘ as a collection of photographs of the @entity8 , they are totally exceptional			2
‘ in terms of what they tell us about the @entity8 , the @entity18 , i ’ve never seen anything like them before			1
i do n’t suppose i ever will again			0
’ the military man gave some of his photos to the loved ones of fallen comrades , including sergeant @entity173			1
@entity173 was killed in the @entity174 in @entity104 @entity175 in may 1917 , and @entity111 presented three pictures to his family after the war ended in 1918			1
director mr @entity93 had a chance meeting with his great - great - grandson @entity181 while chasing the source of the pictures at the @entity184 in @entity142			2
the photographs were undiscovered until two years ago when mr @entity93 stumbled across them while researching the @entity187			1
now , just a week after @entity189 , the director is bringing the 300 pictures to the tv programme to show what life was really like in the war , 100 years on from its outbreak			1
and it is believed that there could be another 200 pictures still undiscovered			2
producer @entity199 , of filmmakers @entity200 , said : ‘ the full philosophical implications of @entity12 ’s remarkable journey from the @entity3 to the end of his life only revealed themselves as we prepared to make this documentary			1
‘ he was , in fact , just a simple , modest @entity142 man - but a man whose message still rings true even today			0
in a way all we had to do was not let him down			0
’ author and @entity8 historian @entity121 described the photographs as ‘ amazing ’ and said they were ‘ extremely rare ’			2
in reference to the picture showing the moment the @entity18 forced the @entity2 to surrender on the @entity219 , mr @entity121 said he had ‘ never seen a picture like it ’			1
he said that while he had seen photographs showing the moment minutes after that scenario , he had not seen a picture depicting the soldiers with their hands in the air taken from that particular view point			2
he said : ‘ the further you go on during the war , the rarer the photo albums become			1
‘ that style of the image taken from over the top , i ’ve never seen anything like that from a private collection			0
action photographs such as that are very rare indeed			2
‘ the quality of his pictures are good			2
he ’s almost certainly used the @entity70 ( @entity70 )			0
‘ he ’s obviously a keen amateur photographer and man who knew how to use a @entity70			0
’ standing up : soldiers at @entity118 in @entity119 in 1915			2
the 14th @entity243 stayed there in wooden huts after being moved from @entity246 in january 1915			2
they remained in the huts at @entity118 until moving to @entity249 in the july of that year horseback : sergeant @entity173 in @entity250 in 1915			2
he was killed at the @entity174 in @entity104 @entity175 two years later the @entity70 ( @entity70 ) was a camera marketed to soldiers during the @entity8			1
it was a foldable camera , which measured no bigger than a smartphone , and could fit easily in a uniform pocket			2
on sale from 1912 until 1926 , the @entity70 was the first camera to use the smaller 127 film reels			2
it had to be loaded through the top with both film spools at once			0
the basic @entity70 was fitted with a two - speed ball bearing shutter – 1/25 and 1/50 sec – and a fixed - focus lens			0
the camera was favoured by soldiers due to its size - when folded it measured no bigger than 2.5 inches by 4.75 inches			2
more than two million were sold before it was discontinued in 1926 , and it is believed that they retailed for about 30 shillings			0
mr @entity121 believes the photographs were most likely taken on the @entity70 , which was a basic camera used by soldiers during the war			1
he said that corporal @entity12 would have had to have been extremely careful to not have been caught using the device , as he would ’ve faced heavy punishment due to the ban in place on filming without permission			1
the historian , whose recent published work includes @entity280 : the @entity99 in @entity282 ’ words and photographs , said : ‘ any pictures from the middle to late @entity3 get really really rare			1
‘ this is obviously a man who knows how to use his camera			2
he ’s got to make sure he ’s taken them quickly			0
he ’s got to be confident the officer is not going to walk around the corner			0
‘ he would ’ve been in serious trouble especially at that time if he had been caught			1
’ mr @entity121 said no officers could be seen in corporal @entity12 ’s collection , perhaps further highlighting the fact they were taken discreetly and out of view			1
he said it is likely he only got his camera out in front of close friends and comrades			0
he said : ‘ there ’s not a single one that has an officer in which is absolutely typical			0
these are really rare photographs			0
‘ he would ’ve been very careful not to wave his cameras around in front of officers			0
‘ he would ’ve looked around , thought “ i would n’t mind getting a shot of that ” , checked no officers were looking , taken the camera out and changed the settings all within 10 seconds			0
‘ it ’s a very quick operation			0
he clearly knows what he ’s doing			0
he would ’ve been very circumspect and would ’ve probably only taken it out in front of his close friends			0
’ mr @entity121 said the @entity70 camera was marketed at soldiers going to war during that time and said it would ’ve cost about 30 shillings			1
he said : ‘ it was quite a basic camera			0
it was built for the man in the street			0
it had roll film , it could fit into a small pocket , and it had fold - away bellows			0
' in its day it was a portable digital camera of its time			1
no thrills , inexpensive but good quality pictures			0
‘ it would ’ve been sold for about 30 shillings which was not an inconsiderable sum for a working class man			0
they would ’ve had to save but ultimately it was n’t beyond their reach			0
’ the public will be able to see @entity111 's album in a new modern history gallery at the @entity136 in @entity142 from next wednesday .			0
