resplendent in a revealing black corset , a pair of fishnet tights and a racy pair of thigh - high boots , the red carpet at last night 's @entity6 provided @entity7 with the opportunity for yet another headline - grabbing stunt			1
never one to shy away from flashing the flesh , the mother - of - four turned and cheekily hoisted her @entity14 skirt for the benefit of waiting photographers before sashaying off			1
once inside @entity19 ' @entity18 , the 56 - year - old began posting snaps on her @entity22 page , posing happily with @entity23 and rapper @entity24 before sharing a risqu√© shot of her cleavage			1
she is also a mother of four , with an eldest child , @entity38 , now 18 , who has just begun studying music , theatre and dance at the @entity42			2
@entity43 , from her second marriage to @entity46 film director @entity45 , is now 14 and no stranger to controversy himself , having caused a storm in october when he posted a video purporting to show is terrorists executing children on his @entity22 page			0
his mother , in typically bombastic fashion , hit back at critics , telling the world that she was ' proud ' of the teenager who was , she added , ' fighting for freedom '			2
such antics , while unsurprising in a teenager , have also become a feature of @entity7 's own forays into social media , along with scores of racy photos			1
typical : aged 56 , @entity7 has no intention of hanging up her corsets and fishnets just yet cheeky : @entity7 took the opportunity to generate a few headlines with a bottom - flash for the paps the latter proved the source of the most recent @entity79 storm to engulf her , after she caused fury by posting pictures of iconic public figures such as @entity83 and @entity84 with bondage tape photoshopped onto their faces			1
in the ensuing furore , she was accused of both racism and narcissism - both of which she took to social media to deny			1
i 'm not comparing my self to anyone			0
i 'm admiring and acknowledging there @entity98 ( sic ) '			0
she added : ' this is niether a crime or an insult or racist ! i also did it with @entity103 and frida khalo and marilyn monroe ( sic )			0
' ' am i saying i am them no i 'm saying they are rebel @entity98 too			0
and i did n't do it my fans did and i just re posted those photos my fans are n't racist either if they put me in the same category as these other people thank you			0
' racy : the 56 - year - old star posted this cleavage - baring snap from inside the @entity18 established : unlike @entity31 and co , @entity7 , pictured with @entity23 ( l ) and @entity24 ( r ) , does n't need publicity ' i 'm very flattered and i hope one day to live up to 1 100th of what those people accomplished			1
' but while @entity7 's forays into social media are sometimes ill - advised , when it comes to her wardrobe , the 56 - year - old remains as outrageous as she was in the 80s			1
the video for her most recent single , @entity129 , saw her gyrating in the midst of a group of horned dancers wearing the skimpiest of sequinned corsets			2
last week , she was spotted shopping in @entity137 wearing yet another corset , this time a sheer black lacy number that left little to the imagination			0
just before @entity142 , the 56 - year - old went even further and posed topless for @entity143 , trussed up in a front-less bra and yet another corset			1
ironically , the shoot was unveiled shortly after she criticised @entity147 for doing the same thing , a week earlier , in @entity149			0
posting yet another topless photo of herself on @entity22 , she added : ' its confusing			0
nipples are considered forbidden and provocative but exposing your ass is not			0
# flummoxed ( sic )			0
' all very @entity31 , the twenty - something popstar who has made her name by twerking enthusiastically in a variety of revealing outfits , while sharing her ( often ) controversial views with her followers on @entity79			2
family : @entity7 is mother to four children , including @entity38 and @entity43 ( left ) and @entity163 ( right ) controversial : she recently caused a @entity79 storm after posting a photo of princess @entity166 in bondage tape striking a pose : just before @entity142 , she starred in a topless photo shoot for @entity143 but @entity7 is no twenty - something , however much she might like to be , and in @entity163 , nine , and @entity170 , eight , has two very young children at home			1
their lives have been shared with a succession of boyfriends , few of whom have lasted more than a year or two , and all of whom have been considerably younger			2
just before her 56th birthday last august , @entity7 split with the latest - 26 - year - old @entity181 who had , rather unromantically , likened her to his mother			1
the eight - month fling with @entity181 followed a three - year relationship with another backing dancer , 26 - year - old @entity185			1
@entity185 , like @entity7 's most famous ex , @entity45 , was slammed by the singer on one of the tracks on her latest album			1
in the song , entitled @entity192 * * * h , she allows herself a chuckle at the dancer 's sexual prowess as well as mocking his lack of wealth			0
controversial : @entity7 with @entity31 , who has managed to pull off several controversies of her own quirky : she has always had an eclectic approach to getting dressed and has no intention of toning it down scanty : for her on stage appearance at the @entity6 , @entity7 chose yet another revealing outfit inspiration : the short red number was seemingly inspired by @entity210 matadors the song contains the lyrics : ' i know you 'd like it if i stayed home and cried			1
but that ai n't gon na happen , here 's the reason why : when we did it , i 'll admit it , was n't satisfied			0
another line boasted : ' i 'm popping bottles that you ca n't even afford			0
i 'm throwing parties and you wo n't get in the door			0
' the track has a reggae - themed chorus , which @entity7 ends with an expletive - filled rant against her former lover , with the line : ' you know you never really know how much your bulls * * t cost me , but f * * k you			2
' so will the @entity7 ever change ? based on recent comments about being obsessed with death and wanting to live in the moment , it would seem unlikely			1
' i became very obsessed with death , ' she confided in the december issue of @entity143 , ' and the idea that you never know when death will arrive			0
' so one has to do as much as possible all the time to get the most out of life			0
' and , whether it means never - ending corsets , regular social media spats or hordes of toy boys , @entity7 is certainly doing that			1
from the moment she burst onto the scene in 1985 's @entity258 , @entity7 has never been afraid to raise eye - brows with a raunchy outfit			2
here are some of the most memorable : first look : @entity7 debuted her love of short and sweet ensembles in 1985 's @entity258 enter the corset : @entity7 , seen performing in @entity266 during her @entity267 , loves a corset iconic : her @entity270 corset , created for the 1990 blonde ambition tour , has become iconic naughty : @entity7 's love of a skimpy outfit was well established as her 1993 @entity276 tour got underway spot the difference ! @entity7 's red carpet style , seen here in 2013 ( left ) and 1991 ( right ) , is little changed skimpy : stage outfits , including those from the 2008 @entity282 , remain as racy as ever favourite : as with each of her tours , the publicity pictures for @entity284 and @entity285 saw @entity7 don a corset raunchy : in 2009 , @entity7 branched out , teaming her thigh - high boots with a see - through shirt instead shocking : in 2012 , @entity7 , back in her corset , shocked when she was seen swigging bourbon on stage old favourite : last night 's @entity14 get - up was typical of @entity7 , as were the fishnets and boots			2
