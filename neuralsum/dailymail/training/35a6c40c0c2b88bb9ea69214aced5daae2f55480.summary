' but my secret weapon was playing darts - with weight loss they always say take up a sport , but i used the dart board to keep me moving in the evenings			0
' it keeps you walking about at night when you are not playing squash or other things			0
it also helps take your mind off food as you are counting the dart score and not the calories			0
