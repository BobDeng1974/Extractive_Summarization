by @entity0 published : 07:16 est , 5 december 2013 updated : 13:51 est , 5 december 2013 a runaway cow caused traffic chaos when it escaped from its field and ran loose on a motorway , evading capture for nearly three hours			1
it is the kind of sight you might expect to see on the streets of @entity10 but not on the fast lane of the @entity12 , where motorists were stunned to witness the @entity15 cross heifer galloping along			1
they called 999 but the animal continued its journey for five miles before the police finally brought its adventure to an end			1
moo - terway : the runaway cow , captured on camera by a shocked car passenger , caused havoc on the roads after it escaped onto a busy motorway and evaded capture for nearly three hours the cow had escaped after being spooked , bolting out of its field in @entity31 , near @entity32 , charging through four fences , then onto a dual carriageway and then up a slip road onto the busy @entity37 motorway			1
drivers faced miles of tailbacks as officers tried to coax the out - of - control cow , which weighed around 60 stone , off the road and to waiting park rangers			2
some worried motorists mistook the cow , with its large horns , for a raging bull and called the police			1
startled passengers took photographs of the cow , which was also captured on @entity55 cameras			2
despite a two - and - a - half hour chase , the terrified animal was unable to be brought under control			0
as it was headed towards a school where the children were about to emerge from classes , the call was made to humanely shoot the cow before the afternoon â€™s rush - hour traffic kicked in , as she was deemed a danger to public safety			2
the stretch of road was closed to traffic while the animal roamed free on the usually busy stretch of motorway the cow was shot dead by a police firearms officer after she left the motorway near @entity77 , @entity78 for a golf course fairway			1
@entity80 , animal rescue specialist for @entity82 , said : ' it was spooked , for whatever reason , and decided to run for it			0
' once they wind themselves up they can carry on and carry on			0
' the decision was made to kill the cow after it left the motorway and traipsed onto the 10th fairway of @entity93 - which is close to three primary schools			1
mr @entity80 said : ' at that stage , because of conflicting reports , we were not sure if it was a @entity99 bull			0
' on advice from me , it was decided the best course of action would be to shoot it - to euthanise it			0
' it was about 40 minutes from the three local schools packing up and it was a danger to human safety			0
' its temperament would not have allowed it to be easily corralled into a situation where it could have been calmed down			0
' the police are responsible for dealing with animal when they are loose in a public space			2
the @entity117 said shooting the animal on tuesday was the most humane way of killing it to protect public safety .			0
