by @entity1 reporter last updated at 7:58 am on 26th october 2011 a federal court is being asked to grant constitutional rights to five killer whales who perform at marine parks in an unprecedented and perhaps quixotic legal action			2
@entity8 is accusing the @entity10 parks of keeping five star - performer whales in conditions that violate the 13th @entity14 ban on slavery			1
@entity10 depicted the suit as baseless			2
the chances of the suit succeeding are slim , according to legal experts not involved in the case ; any judge who hews to the original intent of the authors of the amendment is unlikely to find that they wanted to protect animals			1
but @entity8 relishes engaging in the court of public opinion , as evidenced by its provocative anti-fur and pro-vegan campaigns			1
caged in : killer whale @entity30 - one of the plaintiffs - watches as @entity34 trainers take a break during a training session at the theme park 's @entity37 in @entity34 , @entity39 on march 7 the suit , which @entity8 says it will file on wednesday in @entity42 in @entity43 , hinges on the fact that the @entity14 , while prohibiting slavery and involuntary servitude , does not specify that only humans can be victims			1
@entity48 , @entity8 's general counsel , says his five - member legal team - which spent 18 months preparing the case - believes it 's the first federal court suit seeking constitutional rights for members of an animal species			1
the plaintiffs are the five orcas , @entity30 and @entity57 based at @entity10 in @entity34 , @entity39 , and @entity58 , @entity59 and @entity60 at @entity61			1
@entity30 , a six - ton male , made national news in february 2010 when he grabbed a trainer at the close of a performance and dragged her underwater until she drowned			2
captured nearly 30 years ago off @entity67 , @entity30 has enormous value as a stud and has fathered many of the calves born at @entity10 parks			0
the lawsuit asks the court to order the orcas released to the custody of a legal guardian who would find a ' suitable habitat ' for them			2
' by any definition , these orcas are slaves - kidnapped from their homes , kept confined , denied everything that 's natural to them and forced to perform tricks for @entity10 's profit , ' said mr @entity48			1
' the males have their sperm collected , the females are artificially inseminated and forced to bear young which are sometimes shipped away			0
' @entity10 said any effort to extend the 13th @entity14 's protections beyond humans ' is baseless and in many ways offensive			2
' ' @entity10 is among the world 's most respected zoological institutions , ' the company said			0
' there is no higher priority than the welfare of the animals entrusted to our care and no facility sets higher standards in husbandry , veterinary care and enrichment			0
' eye in the sky : an aerial view of @entity10 in @entity34 , @entity39 shows an orca named @entity30 ( circled in red ) inside of his tank , his nose and tail almost touching either end the statement outlined the many laws and regulations @entity10 is obliged to follow , touted the company 's global efforts to promote conservation of marine mammals , and said the orcas ' performances help give the public a better appreciation and understanding of these animals			1
@entity10 and other @entity132 marine parks are governed by the @entity133 , which allows public displays of the creatures if permits are obtained and the facility offers and education / conservation programs for the public			2
overall , under prevailing @entity132 legal doctrine , animals under human control are considered property , not entities with legal standing of their own			0
they are afforded some protections through animal - cruelty laws , endangered - species regulations and the federal @entity150 , but are not endowed with a distinct set of rights			2
however , the field of animal law has evolved steadily , with courses taught at scores of law schools			0
many prominent lawyers and academics have joined in serious discussion about expanding animal rights			0
@entity164 law professor @entity163 , for example , contends that animals deserve the fundamental right to not be treated as property			0
law professor @entity168 of @entity169 has proposed a new legal category called ' living property ' as a step toward providing rights for some animals			0
mr @entity168 was sceptical that litigation seeking to apply the 13th amendment to animals would prevail			1
' the court will most likely not even get to the merits of the case , and find that the plaintiffs do not have standing to file the lawsuit at all , ' he said by email			1
' i also think a court would not be predisposed to open up that box with fully unknown consequences			0
' @entity188 ? killer whale @entity59 - another plaintiff - leaps out of the water while an unidentified trainer gives signals during @entity10 's @entity193 show in @entity43 in 2006 @entity196 law professor @entity195 , who in past writings has proposed extending legal standing to chimpanzees , also expressed doubt that the courts were ready to apply the 13th amendment to animals			1
but he welcomed the @entity8 lawsuit as a potentially valuable catalyst for ' national reflection and deliberation ' about humans ' treatment of animals			1
' people may well look back at this lawsuit and see in it a perceptive glimpse into a future of greater compassion for species other than our own , ' @entity195 wrote in an email			0
@entity195 noted that some @entity132 might find it bizarre or insulting to equate any treatment of animals to the sufferings of human slavery			2
but he argued that the @entity14 was written broadly , to address unforeseen circumstances , and could legitimately be applied to animals			0
an @entity228 constitutional expert , @entity227 of @entity229 , said he could understand why some blacks might be insulted by the lawsuit , but did n't share that reaction : ' i 'm more entertained by it in the legal context than i am offended by it			0
' @entity8 addressed this issue in the suit , noting that repeated @entity240 rulings have applied the 13th amendment to many forms of involuntary servitude beyond the type of slavery that existed during the @entity246			1
' the historical context is undeniable , ' said @entity48 , the @entity8 lawyer			1
' but that 's not what this case is about			0
it 's about the orcas in their own right , not whether they are or are n't similar to humans			0
' the five orcas are represented in the case by @entity8 and four individuals : @entity258 , a longtime orca and dolphin trainer ; @entity261 , a @entity262 marine biologist who has studied orcas extensively ; @entity264 , founder of the @entity266 , an advocacy group in @entity267 ; and @entity268 , a former orca trainer at @entity34			1
in the wild : a pod of killer whales are seen in @entity273 , @entity274 in june 2009 the lawsuit details the distinctive traits of orcas , the largest species within the dolphin family , including their sophisticated problem - solving and communicative abilities and their formation of complex communities			1
the suit alleges that captivity in the ' barren tanks ' of a marine park suppresses the orcas ' abilities and relationships , and subjects them to stress			1
this sometimes leads to instances where the orcas injure themselves , other orcas or humans that interact with them , according to the suit			1
@entity299 , the @entity300 's marine mammal biologist , said there 's a growing body of research suggesting that whales , dolphins and porpoises have the cognitive sophistication of three - to - four - year - old human children			1
as for the orcas at @entity10 , she said , ' they do n't seem to adapt to captivity			0
i would say they 're miserable			0
' at @entity61 , visitors are shown a film touting the park 's rescue efforts that have saved thousands of sea creatures			0
during the main performance , trainers point out how much the orcas are similar to humans : the babies cry before moving on to babbling and finally imitating the crackling sounds of the adults ' voices			2
@entity327 , 47 , who was visiting from @entity328 , said she was delighted by the show and does not buy the argument that the orcas are slave labourers			0
' i think they are in better conditions here than in the wild , ' she said .			0

@entity8 , three marine - mammal experts , and two former orca trainers file suit
five wild - caught orcas named as plaintiffs
based on the text of the 13th amendment , which prohibits the condition of slavery without reference to ' person ' or any particular class of victim
