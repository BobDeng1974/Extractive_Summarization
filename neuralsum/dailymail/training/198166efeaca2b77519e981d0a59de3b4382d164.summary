@entity0 is determined to be part of a much - improved @entity3 performance at the @entity4 as he continues his late surge into @entity7 contention			1
@entity0 was veering towards the periphery of the 15 - man squad when he put in an alarmingly erratic display in @entity3 's warm - up victory over a @entity12 a team at the @entity15 ground last month			1
but since returning to the one - day international team in the five - wicket win at @entity18 , he has bowled all but one of his full quota in four matches - and taken two wickets on each occasion			1
@entity0 runs into bowl during a nets session ahead of the seventh odi @entity3 ( possible ) : @entity28 ( captain ) , @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35 ( wkt ) , @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 @entity12 ( possible ) : a @entity40 ( captain ) , @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 ( wkt ) , @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 umpires : @entity53 ( @entity54 ) and @entity55 third umpire : @entity57 ( @entity54 ) match referee : @entity59 ( @entity54 ) he has bowled much better lines and been a much more reliable option for captain @entity28			1
@entity0 's improvement has coincided with two wins and two losses on the way to series defeat after @entity3 were also beaten in his absence in the first two fixtures			1
from 4 - 2 down , they will therefore be playing for pride - in front of a significant travelling support - but also @entity7 confidence , and in the hope of a badly - needed return to form for @entity28 at the top of the order , in tuesday 's seventh and final odi			1
@entity0 is frustrated by the scoreline but still believes @entity3 have much incentive to rouse themselves and reduce the deficit			1
' it 's a series we wanted to win , and we thought we had a really good chance of winning , ' he said			1
big - hitting batsman @entity84 takes part in a fielding drill during a nets session ' we 're really close to putting together a full performance			2
' every time you put an @entity3 shirt on , you go out there to win a game for @entity3			2
' we have fans who 've travelled a long way to see us perform , and we plan to put a really good show on for them			0
' @entity0 admits , in a year containing 17 of his 18 odi caps to date , he has lacked consistency			1
but the 26 - year - old seamer has every right to think he may be on an upward curve at the right time , with @entity3 set to pick a tri-series - and unofficial @entity7 - squad on saturday			1
' because i set such high standards for myself , i think it 's been a little bit up and down , ' he said of his performances in 2014			2
@entity3 captain @entity28 speaks with coach @entity112 during a nets session ' at times , i have n't been as consistent as i 'd like			2
but after the last four games especially , i 'm happy i 've been able to back up one performance with another one and then another			0
' so i 'm pretty happy with that progress			0
' his uncanny striking ability down the order has not been evident yet on this tour - but allied to his brilliant fielding , especially his slip catching , means he offers an all - round package to tempt the selectors			2
he said : ' i guess being a three - dimensional cricketer does n't hurt			2
i think i 've steadily improved			0
' i 've been working quite hard on my accuracy and consistency ... and also to keep my pace up , and think i 've shown glimpses in the games			0
' @entity0 takes a break from training as he prepares for the seventh odi @entity0 is hardly about to pre-empt the squad announcement , though			1
' i guess that 's a job for the selectors , ' he added			2
' all i can do is keep putting in my hard work in the nets and any opportunity i do get in games , and leave the rest up to them			0
' as for that shoddy first showing on this tour , he agrees ' rustiness ' following the end of the @entity151 summer might have been a factor			0
he said : ' also [ i was working on ] my plans to left - handers , getting my angles right from round the wicket and mixing up my pace ...			0
i 'm just happy with the improvement i 've made			0
@entity159 appeals during training and then playfights with @entity161 ' on slow wickets , i guess i have the ability to extract a little bit more bounce			0
i find a knack to pick up wickets , even when i 'm not quite bowling as well as i 'd like			0
' that 's quite handy in one - day cricket , keep taking wickets and get two new batters at the crease			1
you can keep building pressure that way			0
' @entity176 has been among his victims three times here - albeit most recently caught at cover off a short one after a match - winning 112 at @entity181			0
but @entity0 said : ' even ( then ) , it was worked to a plan - a change of pace after bowling a few quicker balls			1
' it 's a nice scalp to have a few times			0
' @entity3 are unlikely to make unenforced changes to their losing team in @entity190 , but will be keeping an eye on the fitness of in - form batsman @entity159 - who appeared to be in discomfort at practice with tightness in his groin .			1

@entity3 are 4 - 2 down in the one - day series with @entity12
@entity0 is hoping to impress during the seventh and final odi and secure his place in @entity3 's @entity7 squad
@entity0 admits he has been *inconsistent* in @entity202 matches this year
