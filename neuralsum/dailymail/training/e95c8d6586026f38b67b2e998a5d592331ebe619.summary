' the affair between @entity19 and @entity17 began while he was campaigning for the highest office in the land back in 2004 , and he waited until it was clear that he would neither be the presidential nor vice presidential nominee to sit down in 2008 and admit that he had cheated on his popular wife @entity105			1

that money was the focus of the federal trial against @entity19 , where they had to prove that the money used to hide @entity17 was given by personal donors who understood that it was not so much a political donation to @entity19 ' campaign but that it was being used to help hide the word of the affair			1

' i just thought it was — i thought it was a poor choice , i guess , is all i can say , ' @entity19 said diplomatically			2
as for @entity17 's current role in their family , it remains unclear as she said during her book tour that she and ' @entity209 ' had just decided to end their relationship , though that announcement came just days after they were pictured enjoying a beach vacation with @entity17 for @entity230 .			2
