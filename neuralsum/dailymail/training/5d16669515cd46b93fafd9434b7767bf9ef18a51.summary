from half a pizza to the dregs of a soup bowl , nothing is off - limits			2
launching worldwide next week , the @entity12 app lets people ‘ check in ’ and browse their local offerings			1
once you find something that lights up your tastebuds , get in touch and arrange your doggy bag			1
the team behind it believe it could help fight food poverty			1
appetising ? @entity12 lets people check in and see the half - eaten meals left by their neighbours - then arrange to polish them off			1
its creators think that it will help combat food poverty , an increasing problem creator @entity30 , 25 , said : ' it started out as a joke three years ago			1
my friend and i had a bunch of leftover pizza and we said how great it would be if someone could just finish it off for us			0
' early this year we remembered it in passing , and for some reason it seemed so much more plausible in 2013			0
' so we started doing it in our free time , which would take a while because building an app is amazingly complicated			0

there were 20million in 2008 , now there are 40million			0
' but still , to be honest , if someone cut a sandwich in half , i would happily take the other half			0
