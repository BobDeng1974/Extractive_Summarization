by @entity0 parental concern : @entity0 was shocked his son had been involved in the @entity4 craze a few days ago , my 15 â€‘ year - old son @entity5 filmed himself mixing a cocktail in his own @entity9 boot			2
those who saw his video on @entity12 would have witnessed him adding cold baked beans , a raw egg and a third of a bottle of vodka , before mixing it together and knocking it back in one			1
welcome to the increasingly lethal world of @entity4 , which at the weekend claimed the lives of former grammar school boy @entity23 , aged 20 , and 29 - year - old @entity24 , from @entity25			2
a week before it was linked to the death of two young men in @entity29			1
the @entity4 craze has primarily spread on @entity12 - where else ? - like the deadliest of viruses			1
the idea is that you film yourself drinking something horrible , then post the video online and nominate two friends to outdo you , giving them 24 or 48 hours to do so			1
if anything , @entity4 acts as a further reminder that for all the advantages the internet has brought us , it also encourages intelligent people to do incredibly stupid and reckless things			1
as a father of three , i find all this worrying in the extreme			2
until last week i 'd never heard of @entity4 , and certainly did n't know that my own son had partaken			2
i was predictably horrified when i found out ;			2
@entity5 had always seemed perfectly sensible about alcohol , and appeared to have taken to heart my warnings about teenagers drinking too much			2
so this seemed like a rare but spectacular transgression , terrifying proof of the dangers of social media			2
i went to find him in his bedroom			2
' are you mad ? ' i exploded , having just seen the video			1
' you could have killed yourself drinking something like that			2
' his eyes filled with tears			2
' i could n't , ' he said			2
' it was just a joke			0
' allowed to continue : @entity12 say the game is n't breaking any of their rules while my son at first appeared to be one of those reckless people who had succumbed to the siren call of online ' fun ' , i was relieved to discover that the @entity76 he appeared to be downing was , in fact , just water			1
he can be pretty daft , but he 's not that daft			0
sadly , one of his school friends mixed a different cocktail , containing cod liver oil , cat biscuits , ketchup and what appeared to be two shots of his own urine			0
he topped it up with beer and drank it down			0
thanks to @entity12 , @entity4 is spreading beyond even immature youngsters			1
one of my friends , @entity93 , a businessman in his mid- 50s , shamefacedly told me this week that he 'd taken part			0
far from being a bit of fun , the @entity4 craze is peer pressure of the most dangerous kind he 's a man with such a heightened sense of social responsibility that he spends a fortnight every year doing voluntary work in @entity104			0
but after receiving a @entity4 invitation from his 20 - year - old daughter on @entity12 , and wanting to show that he was game for a laugh , a dad for all seasons , he rose to the challenge			1
he filled a pint glass with lager , cider , gin , milk , @entity116 , salt and pepper and glugged it down for the amusement of his daughter and her friends , who later watched the footage online			0
' would i do it again now knowing that people have died ? ' he said yesterday			1
i just thought it was a bit of fun			0
' but far from being a bit of fun , the @entity4 craze is peer pressure of the most dangerous kind			0
if highly educated , worldly , middle - aged fathers can submit to it , then what hope gauche , impressionable teenagers trying desperately to gain credibility with their mates ? what makes it so seductive , and so hard to stop in its tracks , is how it spreads like online wildfire			0
of course , one of the immutable facts of parenthood is that every father of teenagers has been a teenager himself			0
even right into my 20s i sank the odd yard of ale , propelled not by extreme thirst but , yes , by extreme peer pressure			0
but in my own teens and 20s i always drank in a social situation			0
the great paradox of social networking is that there is actually nothing sociable about it			0
@entity5 was on his own in the house when he decanted my vodka and filled up his welly			0
and , unfortunately , just as the essence of the @entity4 game is for your nominees to go one step further , so must every generation outdo the one before			1
the @entity12 generation have a kind of ersatz independence that is intoxicating for them in more ways than one i first heard about dares involving grotesque mixtures of alcohol from my older son @entity177 when he came home from parties telling us about the phenomenon of the ' dirty pint '			1
this was a pint glass filled with a combination of things from the food cupboard if you were lucky , from the drinks cabinet if you were n't			0
my wife and i impressed upon him the terrible dangers of drinking mixtures of spirits , wine and beer			0
he indignantly told us that he would never be so stupid and would always refuse a dirty pint , no matter how much taunting might ensue			0
but the ' dirty pint ' challenge has now moved online , and that is what makes it so much more dangerous			0
play video play video play video play video play video play video play video play video play video play video play video play video play video @entity5 has now had the same lecture that his older brother received			1
but while we can give our children any number of stern warnings and even try to control what kind of parties they go to , we sadly have no influence over what they see on their computers and their smartphones			2
the @entity12 generation have a kind of ersatz independence that is intoxicating for them in more ways than one			1
my daughter @entity235 is in her final year at university , about to embrace real independence			0
@entity235 has not yet been neknominated , although , having started as a craze favoured by young men , it is now sweeping through her netball team			2
' it 's gone crazy , ' she said			0
' but do n't worry , i wo n't do it			0
' should know better : grown men have been involved - so what hope do teens have to resist ? but parents should n't only be worrying about their teenagers			0
if 15 - year - olds are doing it , then what 's to stop 12 - year - olds or ten - year - olds ? which makes it all the more alarming that @entity12 , as yet , has done nothing to stop or even vaguely discourage @entity4			1
worse , it seems to be profiting from it			0
despite these tragic deaths , @entity12 still displays adverts next to videos of people taking part in the drinking challenges			1
while it has removed advertising on @entity4 group pages ( where individuals can discuss common interests in a collective forum ) and does not show targeted advertising linked to the craze , this means @entity12 is still profiting from people watching these clips			1
there is no suggestion that the companies involved know that their adverts are being placed alongside @entity4 videos , but @entity12 will either receive a fee upfront or be paid each time a user clicks on the advert 's link			1
there are many household names alongside the @entity4 videos , from the online shopping site @entity289 to the @entity290 , @entity291 to @entity292 , and even the mental health charity @entity294			0
it is , quite frankly , stomach - churning			0
so how can @entity12 justify this ? @entity12 executives might contend that the recent fatalities can hardly be laid at their door			1
it was n't them who forced those people to drink what they did , they might say well , it claims in its mission statement to monitor the 1.23 billion users active online every month , prohibiting ' content deemed to be directly harmful ' , while allowing ' content that is offensive or controversial '			1
@entity4 is certainly controversial , but is it ' directly harmful ' ? @entity12 's definition of ' harmful ' includes anything that ' directly inflicts emotional distress on a specific private individual , for example , bullying '			1
i 'd say @entity4 falls pretty squarely into that category			0
after all , is n't peer pressure a form of bullying , and is there anything that inflicts greater emotional distress than death ? i suppose @entity12 executives might contend that the recent fatalities can hardly be laid at their door			1
it was n't them who forced those people to drink what they did , they might say			1
but this position is a total abdication of responsibility			0
for the truth is that @entity12 does have the power to delete or prohibit content on its pages , and has acted swiftly in the past to use it			1
it has , for instance , repeatedly come under fire for removing pictures of breastfeeding mothers , citing a violation of terms where photos feature a fully exposed breast			0
just last year campaigners hit out at @entity12 for also removing images of women who have undergone mastectomies because they were classified as ' pornography '			1
but when it comes to @entity4 , @entity12 's stock response , even after the deaths this weekend , has been that while some people might find content offensive , it is not necessarily breaching any of the company 's own rules			1
' at @entity12 we try to be a platform where people can share freely whilst still protecting the rights of others , ' says a spokesman			1
' we encourage people to report things to us which they feel breaks our rules so we can review and take action on a case - by - case basis			2
we also give people the ability to remove themselves from an uncomfortable conversation through tools such as untagging and blocking			2
' but as you see the endless roll - call of advertisers placed alongside the @entity4 videos which have had such a deadly impact on so many youngsters , you are tempted to draw the obvious conclusion : that @entity12 could ban these extreme drinking videos if it wanted to - but its thirst for profits is too great .			1

game has been *blamed* for death of number of young people
involves posting video of player downing a drink on @entity12
then nominating friend to better it within 24 hours
