he had to have it			2
it was so old it did n’t have a barcode			2

@entity123 enjoyed using @entity116 notebooks there was uproar			1

@entity151 had a huge callus on the third finger of his right hand just from using a pencil for so many hours a day			0

( his favourite classification number in the @entity196 is 651 : @entity197			0
