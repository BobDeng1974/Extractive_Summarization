disgraced mp @entity0 used his taxpayer - funded credit to pay for £ 450 - a - night hotels during his £ 13,000 expenses binge , it has been revealed			1
the @entity5 backbencher , who is standing down at the next election after he was convicted of headbutting a @entity7 mp in a @entity9 bar , repeatedly used his parliamentary card to settle big bills			1
many of these payments were later declared unclaimable on expenses , but his card was not blocked by the @entity16 ( @entity17 ) for more than two years			1
he even claimed that one £ 896.92 bill for two nights was for a ' whole bunch of people ' to stay at the four - star @entity22 near @entity24			1
disgraced mp @entity0 used his taxpayer - funded credit to pay for £ 450 - a - night hotels during his £ 13,000 expenses binge @entity28 's @entity27 revealed earlier this week that commons expenses chiefs made the unprecedented decision to recoup the cash by deducting around £ 1,000 a month from his salary			1
but that will not clear the outstanding sum of around £ 10,000 before @entity35 is dissolved			2
the @entity37 mp accepts that he made mistakes in filing claims after using his card , suggesting he was also paying for rooms for staff			2
however , he is disputing at least £ 6,000 of the debt			2
if he refuses to repay voluntarily the watchdog 's only option will be to pursue him in the civil courts			0
the details emerged after @entity17 admitted it has been labelling some of mr @entity0 's hotel claims as ' not paid ' in its regular disclosures - when in fact it has paid a much higher bill in full			1
the @entity37 mp accepts that he made mistakes in filing claims after using his card , suggesting he was also paying for rooms for staff the watchdog confirmed he put £ 743 on a card to fund a three night - stay at a ' non-london ' hotel , believed to be in @entity61 , in september last year			1
the bill was automatically paid by @entity17			2
but as he is only entitled to claim up to £ 120 a night for hotels outside the capital , an excess of £ 383 was added to his debt			1
the published expenses records merely state that £ 383 was ' not paid '			2
he was was ' not paid ' £ 272.33 for a @entity60 hotel claim in august , and £ 208 for another in september			2
mr @entity0 stayed at a prestigious @entity72 in @entity73 in may 2013 , when he appears to have broken the £ 150 a night limit for hotels in the capital by £ 203.05			1
he used the same group again the following month , but this time breached the ceiling by just £ 61.45			2
the issues seem to go back to at least 2012			2
in december of that year - 10 months after he headbutted a @entity7 mp during a brawl in a @entity9 bar - he charged £ 896.92 to the card for a two - night stay at a @entity73 hotel			1
it is understood that the claim was declared invalid because key parts of the receipt had been blacked out - although again @entity17 had already footed the cost and subsequently reported it as ' not paid '			2
altogether there are dozens of hotel claims listed as either ' not paid ' or ' part paid ' since 2012 , totalling some £ 4,000			2
mr @entity0 insisted he was using hotels booked through the parliamentary travel office , and said some bills were high because staff stayed at the same time			1
the £ 896.92 bill was for a ' whole bunch of people ' to stay at the @entity22 near @entity24 , he said			1
' that was all of my staff in @entity73 , ' he said			0
' that was essentially an error			0
it should have come off my ( personal ) card			2
' they would have all been eligible ( for expenses ) but the parliamentary card was used rather than their cards or my card			1
' mr @entity0 said @entity17 had contacted him about spending in late 2013 , but he heard nothing else and believed they had dropped the matter until last december			1
he even claimed that one £ 896.92 bill for two nights was for a ' whole bunch of people ' to stay at the four - star @entity22 near @entity24 ( pictured ) ' the whole figure was only exposed in december , ' he said			1
' some of these figures are legitimate debts to @entity17 but they would not discuss the rest of it			0
' mr @entity0 said there was a ' particular issue ' with a member of staff who moved to @entity131 from @entity132			1
he said the watchdog had signed off an arrangement where the employee worked from home but occasionally stayed at hotels in @entity73			0
however , after 16 months , @entity17 decided the claims were invalid and demanded the money back , according to mr @entity0			1
the mp said he had asked the watchdog 's compliance officer to look again at the situation			0
an @entity17 spokesman said : ' mps have a responsibility to manage their financial affairs and we publish details of all of their claims - both paid and not			0
' we have consistently told the mp that he has a budget to keep to and that he is liable for any excess			0
we have stressed this time and again throughout the @entity35 , as we do to every mp			0
' we 've been talking to the mp since autumn 2013 to put his financial affairs on an even keel			0
as you would expect , when this did n't work we escalated these conversations within @entity17 and this approach resulted in a personal assurance from the mp that he would repay the amounts due			0
mr @entity0 stayed at a prestigious @entity72 in @entity73 in may 2013 , when he appears to have broken the £ 150 a night limit for hotels in the capital by £ 203.05 ' when those assurances were not followed through , we turned off his payment card in january 2015 and in february 2015 we moved to recovering money directly from his salary			1
we will continue to recover this money until it is repaid in full			0
' this is a very unusual case			0
we 've tried to encourage the mp to manage this situation			0
clearly , this has n't worked and we are committed to getting this money back			0
that is why have moved to more direct measures of recovery , including taking money straight from his pay packet			0
' in 2008 , before @entity17 took over the system , mr @entity0 had his parliamentary expenses suspended after putting nearly £ 5,000 in ' non-parliamentary ' travel expenses to @entity184 , @entity185 and @entity186 on a @entity9 card , and then ignoring repeated demands from officials to repay			1
the latest situation could fuel calls for @entity17 to publish fuller , receipt - level information about @entity145 ' spending			0
the watchdog has already lost two rounds of an @entity197 battle to avoid publishing copies of every receipt filed , a process that could potentially cost millions of pounds			0
the @entity201 is due to hear the case later this month - but no judgement is expected until after the election			0
in march 2013 the former @entity205 major was banned from buying alcohol in @entity35 following another bust - up			0
he was fined £ 1,500 for abusive language towards a baggage handler at @entity211 earlier this year			0
mr @entity0 has refused to resign his seat despite pressure from critics			1
