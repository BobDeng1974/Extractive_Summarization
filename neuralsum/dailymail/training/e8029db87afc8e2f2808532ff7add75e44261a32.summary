@entity101 is still the @entity53 holidaymakers ' favourite destination , with the @entity105 and @entity104 also seeing a lot of tourists			1
meanwhile @entity108 , @entity109 and @entity110 are offering great value holidays , @entity93 said			2
@entity112 , @entity93 chief executive , said : ' this weekend is one the busiest of the year as families head off overseas for a well - earned summer break			2
' this year , traditional favourites in the @entity116 like @entity101 and @entity117 have bounced back after two tough years , with customers taking advantage of some of the lowest day - to - day expenses overseas			2
' however despite downpours blighting much of @entity53 for the past few days , the sunshine looks set to arrive in the nick of time			1
a bright and dry weekend is on the way for most of us , pushing away the heavy showers which have turned this week into a washout for many			2

splashing day out : tourists in @entity137 take shelter from torrential rain yesterday although the @entity142 will be basking in the sunniest spells , the rest of us will also be tempted out to finally enjoy a touch of summer in what has been a disappointingly cool july			1
before that , however , some will have to put up with a patchy outlook tomorrow			2
the @entity43 is forecast to be bright and dry but cooler winds and isolated showers mean the @entity142 will have to wait just a bit longer to banish the chill and rain			0

there are also plenty of ways to check for updates whenever you stop for a break , which you should do every two hours			0
' in @entity31 this afternoon a lorry crashed leaving the driver sitting on top of his cab , not daring to move a muscle in case the truck plunged into a ravine the lorry smashed through a wall and was left balancing precariously on the edge of a road above a sheer drop into the ravine in scene reminiscent of the hit film @entity207 starring @entity211 , where a coachload of gangsters and their gold bullion balanced on a clifftop			1
emergency crews arrived at the scene and found the trucker perched on top of his cab , too scared to move in case the slightest tremor sent the vehicle crashing into the ravine			0
his lorry had jack - knifed on @entity224 in @entity225 and came to rest teetering over the edge of the hill			0
amazingly the driver , who has not been named , walked away with just cuts and bruises after being plucked to safety by @entity232			0
an eye witness in @entity234 , a road that runs below the scene of the incident , who did not wish to be named , said ' we heard a huge bang , went outside and looked up and there was the lorry hanging over the edge of the hill			0
' parts of the wall came away and at first we thought it was outside our building			0
' the drama began at 9.15 this morning and blocked the @entity248 in both directions			0
the road is likely to remain closed until late this afternoon because a crane is being brought in to remove the lorry			0
