by @entity0 published : 06:38 est , 3 september 2013 updated : 06:39 est , 3 september 2013 a @entity2 biologist has found human behaviour could be driving the evolution of animals ' brains by changing the habitats in which they live			1
the research suggests the brains of some animals have got bigger in tandem with the industrialisation of their habitat - making some city animals smarter than their rural peers			1
evolutionary biologist @entity17 discovered white - footed mouse and meadow voles living in cities , had on average brains that were six per cent larger than the brains of animals collected from farms in the countryside			1
a @entity2 biologist has found human behaviour could be driving the evolution of animals ' brains by changing the habitats in which they live			1
the research suggests the brains of some animals such as this white - footed mouse have got bigger in tandem with the industrialisation of their habitat associate professor @entity17 , of the @entity36 's @entity35 , believes animals are showing ' complex cognitive responses to both urban and rural areas with cranial capacity tracking human - induced change in some cases '			1
she is interested in whether small animals will be able to cope with the conversion of prairies to agriculture or forests being replaced by cities to ultimately cope with human - induced change			2
previous research found a link between brain size and the ability to adapt to urban environments in birds , but did not investigate whether the change of environment caused the evolution			2
together with undergraduate student @entity59 , professor @entity17 set out to find ' if dealing with a new environment is just a matter of species sorting - in which a particular species is " pre-adapted " for success in a particular environment - or actually changes going on within species in addition to that species - level variation '			0
the researchers examined specimens from the @entity73 collections dating back to the early @entity74 , focusing on the cranial capacity of 10 species , including varieties of shrews , voles , bats , and squirrels , along with a mouse and gopher , from locations in and around the @entity86 metro			2
evolutionary biologist @entity87 discovered white - footed mouse and meadow voles ( pictured ) living in cities , had on average brains that were 6 per cent larger than the brains of animals collected from farms in the countryside they found the urban populations of two of the species did , in fact , possess significantly greater cranial capacity and predicted that if cleverer animals thrived in urban environments , cranial capacity should also increase over time			1

while the researchers ca n’t say for certain whether the changes are evolutionary or developmental , evidence suggests the former			0
' we tended to not see changes in body size which suggests it ’s not just nutritional , but rather an evolutionary response , ' said professor @entity17			0
she said the study ' reminds us of the fact that populations adapt , and that at least some species are tracking human - induced environmental change			0
' the researchers found the urban populations of two of the species did possess significantly greater cranial capacity and predicted that if cleverer animals thrived in urban environments , cranial capacity should increase over time			0
pictured is a squirrel ( left ) and gopher ( right ) enjoying life close to humans however , some of the specimens examined contradicted her theory			0
' we did n’t see cranial capacity increases over time in the urban specimens ... and actually , for two species we see a decline over time , while the bats and shrews show an increase in cranial capacity in rural populations			0
' professor @entity17 said : ' neural tissue is incredibly expensive metabolically			0
there are trade - offs in investing in brains and investing in reproduction , which may be why we see a reduction in cranial capacity over time in two of the species – larger brains may be favored just during the initial colonisation of the city			1
' she thinks humans are changing rural environments in ways that could be just as challenging as cities , resulting in the changes in cranial capacity over time seen in bats and shrews .			2

@entity87 discovered white - footed mouse and meadow voles living in cities have larger brains than animals collected from the countryside
the @entity36 research could be used to *prioritise* *conservation* efforts in rural areas being turned into farming land or towns
