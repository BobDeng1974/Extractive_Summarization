by @entity0 , @entity2 political editor and @entity3 president @entity4 announced late friday morning that he has accepted ' with considerable regret ' the resignation of scandal - hit veterans affairs secretary @entity7			1
but the shake - up had all the markings of an @entity11 firing			1
at a hastily arranged press conference , @entity4 said : ' @entity14 's commitment to our veterans is unquestioned			2
his service to our country is exemplary			0
' ' i am grateful for his service , as are many veterans across the country , ' he said			0
the president said @entity7 , a wounded @entity25 veteran , was a ' very good man ' and that it was his own decision to step down – he was becoming a ' distraction ' to sorting out the waiting list scandal that has engulfed the agency and the @entity30 in recent weeks			1
it was ' @entity14 's judgement that he could not carry out the next stages of reform without being a distraction himself , ' @entity4 said			2
' my assessment was , unfortunately , he is right			0
' but just a few hours earlier , @entity7 spoke at a meeting of the @entity37 in @entity38 , sounding very much like a man prepared to fight for his job with big plans to fix his agency 's ' breach of integrity			1
' i think he is deeply disappointed in the fact that bad news did not get to him , ' the president said of @entity7 , ' and that the structures were n’t in place for him to identify this problem quickly and fix it			2
' support for @entity7 had quickly eroded on @entity88 , with more than 100 members of @entity90 calling for his ouster by friday			2
many were @entity93 facing tough re-election battles in states where @entity96 dominate the electorate			0
but leading the charge was @entity96 sen. @entity99 from @entity100 , where the @entity48 's most high - profile failures first surfaced			1
' if secretary @entity7 does not step down voluntarily , ' @entity99 said wednesday , ' then i call on the president of the @entity2 to relieve him of his duties , to fire him			1
' more congressional outrage and high - road commentary followed friday morning 's changing of the guard			1
another @entity100 , @entity96 @entity109 , laid the scandal squarely on @entity4 's shoulders			2
' president @entity4 has ostensibly forced @entity112 to resign over the scandals and systemic failures at the @entity48			2
i appreciate the president and @entity112 heeding my call and those of my colleagues to resign			0
but i say accountability ends at the president ’s feet , ' @entity109 said friday			0
' as the sign on president @entity123 ’s desk in the @entity11 stated , " the buck stops here			2
" ... the president needs to step up and set a better example of leadership			0
' ' with secretary @entity7 ’s resignation today , we can begin to address the systemic dysfunction that has plagued the @entity48 for years , ' said @entity132 @entity131 rep. @entity131 , who chairs the powerful @entity133 in the @entity134			1
' there are serious problems at the @entity48 that wo n’t be solved simply by replacing the secretary , ' explained a more defensive sen. @entity138 , a @entity139 from the state of @entity38			2
@entity142 @entity141 sen. @entity141 took a swipe at the @entity4 administration , saying the @entity48 lacked ' accountability ' and ' is in desperate need of stronger , more aggressive leadership			2
' a pair of senators , one from each major party , also demanded a criminal investigation by the @entity152			0
@entity154 chair @entity153 , a @entity155 @entity139 , and its vice-chair , @entity157 @entity96 @entity156 , said they would propose a bill next week giving the @entity152 the resources it will need ' for criminal and civil investigations into allegations that the @entity48 falsified patient records at centers and clinics across the country			0
' ' this scandal has dragged on over a decade , ' they wrote in a letter to attorney general @entity170			0
' we believe the @entity172 should begin investigations right away ... and bring any charges that might be appropriate			0
' @entity176 @entity93 sen. @entity175 , known on @entity88 as a partisan 's partisan , said in a statement to @entity179 that @entity7 ' is in the fullest sense of the word a true patriot			2
in keeping with @entity7 ’s stellar character , he offered his resignation because he realized , as every good soldier does , that the buck stops at the top			0
' @entity4 said friday that @entity48 deputy secretary @entity56 would step in as acting secretary of the @entity48 while the administration looks for a permanent replacement for @entity7			1
the president said he spoke to @entity56 this morning and ' made it clear that reforms should not wait			0
' fired ? @entity7 sounded friday morning like a man grappling with how to fix his ailing agency , but hours later @entity4 said he ' offered ' his resignation instead famously aloof : @entity4 appeared friday morning in an @entity11 interview on the ' @entity198 ' show , calmly describing a ' serious conversation ' he was about to have with @entity7 about ' whether he ... has the capacity to take on the job of fixing it ' ' i said we will not tolerate misconduct , and we will not , ' @entity4 said			1
' i said that we could better , and we will			0
' @entity4 also announced that @entity30 deputy chief of staff @entity206 , who is leading the @entity48 's internal review of its practices , will stay on temporarily at the @entity48 while reforms are put in place			1
support for @entity7 seemed to crater in recent days , with press secretary @entity212 refusing on thursday to answer a yes - or - no question about whether the president still had ' confidence ' in @entity7			1
on may 19 , as the worst of the allegations against the @entity48 yet came in , @entity4 's chief spokesman stated flatly that ' the president has confidence in @entity112			1
' but on thursday he dodged a point - blank dare to repeat that endorsement			0
@entity212 calmly offered a contradictory set of guidelines about actions the @entity48 and the @entity30 should take in response to the brewing veterans ' health care scandal			1
' this is very important , ' @entity212 said just minutes into his briefing on thursday			0
' the va should not and must not wait for the current investigation of @entity48 operations to conclude before taking steps to improve care			0
' moments later he told reporters that president @entity4 would likely wait before taking action			1
' the president identified last week that he expected a preliminary report from @entity112 's internal audit very soon , ' instructed @entity212			1
' and once he receives that he 'll be able to evaluate those findings along with what we 're seen in the interim report from the inspector general , and then assess where we are at that time			0
' off the wait list : @entity7 could n't survive more than 100 demands for his head from members of @entity90 in his last public appearance as an @entity4 cabinet secretary , he apologized , and conceded that his agency had ' a systemic , totally unacceptable lack of integrity			1
' but hours before he was to meet face - to - face with @entity4 in the @entity11 , @entity7 was focused on fixing that ' breach of integrity ' – describing the firing of top va managers at the agency 's medical center in @entity262			1
while @entity7 was speaking , @entity4 was appearing on the ' @entity198 ' show in a segment taped a day earlier			1
he described a ' serious conversation ' he would soon have with his @entity48 secretary about ' whether he thinks that he is prepared and has the capacity to take on the job of fixing it			0
' on wednesday the @entity48 's inspector general released a preliminary report showing that veterans in @entity262 , @entity100 , waited an average of 115 days for a first medical appointment , and that 1,700 of them were left off of waiting lists and denied care entirely			1
about 40 veterans died while waiting to see doctors in @entity262 alone			0
an internal review of the @entity48 headed up by @entity206 found that managers at more than 60 percent of the @entity48 's hospitals had been lying about how long veterans were waiting for care and there was a ' systemic lack of integrity within some @entity289 facilities			1
' that report hit @entity4 's desk friday morning after @entity7 delivered brief remarks to the homeless veterans group			1
shortly after , @entity7 resigned			0
' he felt like new leadership would be -- would serve our veterans best , ' @entity4 said on friday			2
/ and i agree with him			0

@entity4 accepted his resignation friday morning after learning how deep - seated the @entity48 's problems are
managers at more than 60 percent of the @entity48 's hospitals lied about how long veterans were waiting for care , an internal audit of the @entity48 found
the @entity30 hedged its bets a day earlier , stopping short of expressing the president 's ' confidence ' in the cabinet secretary
@entity4 told reporters that @entity7 himself decided to step down , but the change had all the markings of an @entity11 firing
in a public speech just hours earlier , @entity7 described his plans to fix his agency 's ' breach of integrity '
