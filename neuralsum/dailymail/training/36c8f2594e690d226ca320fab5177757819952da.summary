the number of people living with @entity2 in the @entity3 has reached a record high			1
the @entity5 ( @entity5 ) said there were now about 100,000 people who have the virus , an all - time high			2
but health officials have warned a quarter of people who have the human immunodeficiency virus are not aware they have been infected			2
the number of people living with @entity2 in the @entity3 has reached a record high there were 6,280 people diagnosed with @entity2 in 2011 , the @entity5 said			1
nearly half of all diagnoses in 2011 were acquired heterosexually			0
of these , more than half were probably acquired in the @entity3 , compared to only 27 per cent in 2002 according to the @entity5 report			2
new diagnoses among gay men has also reached an all - time high in 2011 , with 3,010 men discovering they were infected			0
the @entity5 said that one in 20 men who have sex with men in the @entity3 now have @entity2 , the figure soars to nearly one in 12 in @entity27			1
black @entity29 people are also at a higher risk , the @entity5 said , with 37 per 1,000 living with the infection - overall @entity2 prevalence in the @entity3 was 1.5 per 1,000 people			1
dr @entity34 , @entity5 head of @entity2 surveillance , said : ' these figures are a reminder of how vital safe sex programmes remain			1
' promoting hiv testing and condom use is crucial to tackling the high rates of transmission , late diagnosis and undiagnosed @entity2 still seen in the @entity3			1
' @entity44 is a great opportunity to encourage people to get tested			0
' we also encourage clinicians to take every opportunity to offer the test to those in higher risk groups and , in high prevalence areas , to all general medical admission and new gp registrants			1
' the good news is that with the excellent services and treatments available nowadays , if diagnosed and treated early someone with @entity2 can look forward to a normal lifespan , as well as protecting their sexual partners from infection			1
at risk groups include gay and bisexual men and @entity29 communities ' that 's why it is vitally important that anyone who has been at risk gets an hiv test , and that those in higher risk groups get screened regularly			1
' at risk groups include gay and bisexual men and @entity29 communities			1
the @entity74 said regular testing can halt the spread of @entity2			2
ithe trust said in the @entity3 , gay and bisexual men and @entity29 communities remain the groups most affected by @entity2 , but more than a quarter of those with @entity2 in these groups are undiagnosed and therefore at risk of serious health problems			1
sir @entity86 , chief executive of the charity , said : ' @entity2 is an entirely preventable condition , yet each year we see thousands more people across the @entity3 receive this life - changing diagnosis			1
' while there is still no cure and no vaccine , that does n't mean we need to accept its continuing march			0
' reducing undiagnosed @entity2 by encouraging those in high - risk groups to test more regularly is one way we can put the brakes on the spread of infection			1
' a simple @entity2 test , offered free at clinics and testing services all over the country , might add over 40 years to the life of someone with @entity2 , diagnosed in good time			2
' knowing your status also helps you protect your partners in the future			0
' thirty years on from the start of the epidemic , public understanding of @entity2 has dropped to a worrying level			0
' as a result , we are starting to see a significant increase in the number of heterosexuals acquiring the virus in the @entity3			2
' it is important that everyone , no matter their age or background , understands that nobody is immune from infection			0
' we all have a responsibility to get our understanding of the virus up to a basic level , and know how to keep ourselves and our loved ones safe			0
' 6,280 people were diagnosed with @entity2 in 2011 , a 1 per cent decrease on the previous year			2
nearly half ( 47 per cent ) of those people were diagnosed late , after a point at which they should have started treatment			0
500 people with @entity2 died in 2011			2
48 per cent of new diagnoses in 2011 were among heterosexuals , and 52 per cent of those infections were acquired in the @entity3			0

professor @entity150 , chair of the @entity151 , added : ' many people are simply not being signposted to take an hiv test			0
' with a general lack of routine @entity2 testing being commissioned for general medical admissions and in the general practice setting this is not altogether surprising			0
' we need a greater emphasis on hiv testing and on all aspects of prevention			0
' with successful treatment , a person with @entity2 in the @entity3 can expect a near - normal lifespan			1
' but for that to happen , early diagnosis is vital			0
' too many people only get tested when their @entity2 infection is already at an advanced stage , compromising both their own health and that of their partners			1
' @entity2 attacks the immune system and weakens the ability to fight infections and disease			0
@entity178 is the final stage of hiv infection , when the body can no longer fight life - threatening infections			0
@entity2 is found in the body fluids of an infected person , and about 95 % of people are infected through sexual contact			2
@entity186 , chief executive of the @entity187 , said : ' what is striking about the @entity5 's data is how it really shows both our successes and our shortcomings in tackling @entity2 in the @entity3			1
' on the one hand , we can hail treatment as a real success story			0
treatment is effective , people diagnosed with @entity2 can access it easily , and it is working in keeping the virus under control			1
' however , when it comes to increasing the uptake of testing - the gateway to treatment - our services are patchy , inconsistent and ultimately we are still failing to make any significant headway in tackling the high rates of undiagnosed @entity2			0
