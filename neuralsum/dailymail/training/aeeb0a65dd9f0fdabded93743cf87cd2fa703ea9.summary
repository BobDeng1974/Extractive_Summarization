by @entity0 @entity1 is unusual even within the world of taxidermy , perhaps not only because she is a young attractive woman , but because she chooses to eat the animals she works with before stuffing them			1
the 22 - year - old , from @entity7 , makes bespoke designs from roadkill or animals that have died through other means , and attempts to eat as much as possible of an animal , as long as the meat is fresh enough			1
the former art student , who studied fine art at @entity17 , says this decision is based on wanting to recycle and minimise waste , and happily tucks in to a diet more akin to that of a medieval lord than a modern woman			2
doing what i do ensures i recycle a deceased animal , as a meat eater , there is no logic in wasting perfectly edible meat			2
‘ it is important to me , because it upholds all of the notions that underpin taxidermy , and it means that i do the animal justice in recycling all of it			0
’ with pheasant , rabbit , wood pigeon , squirrel , and deer all regularly on the menu and her workbench , @entity25 is unsurprisingly regularly the target of hate and abuse from people who disagree with her practice			1
she has received abuse online with people saying she deserves to ‘ go to hell ’ and threatening to ‘ cut her up ’			0
video courtesy of @entity1 @entity25 , pictured putting the final touches on one of her creations , has received abuse online for her work but stresses ethical considerations are her top priority @entity81 studied @entity82 at @entity17 before beginning her unusual career one of @entity25 's creations , which she mainly sources from road kill , farmers and aviculturists but despite this , @entity25 has not been deterred from her passion			1
‘ i am lucky to have a close network of people around me who support what i do , which has helped to give me the confidence to excel in what i do and push myself			0
‘ i have had animal rights activists , vegans , vets and animal lovers take my classes and they have all been really complimentary about the steps i take to ensure the most virtuous and human preservation is being carried out			2
’ but @entity25 is keen to point out she is extremely conscious of ethics when it comes to her work			1
speaking to the @entity25 says : ‘ taxidermy combines my interests in biology , animal science and conservation			1
it allows me to experience the fascination of animal biology , whilst also providing me with the opportunity to preserve animals for educational study			2
giving animals new life is an immense privilege to me			0
the high level of skill , effort and time required for each of @entity25 's pieces means they can cost hundreds of pounds ‘ i will never harm an animal for the purpose of my work			1
i have many connections to farmers and aviculturists across the country that control pests and livestock on their land			0
‘ i have no intervention in the way that these animals are controlled , and am simply a vehicle of alternative disposal for their owners and keepers			0
‘ i also take pride in working with road kill , or animals that i find deceased in wooded areas where i live			1
i keep a paper trail to log the properties of every animal that i find , and acquire all the correct licenses when appropriate			0
’ while she creates stunning designs herself and on commission - from imposing peacocks to mouse ornaments and bird based fashion pieces - she also teaches taxidermy classes			1
@entity162 in @entity163 and from an @entity165 farm house , these sessions allow anyone to learn how to properly prepare and stuff a mouse for £ 60			0
but for those who do n’t quite trust themselves , @entity25 will preserve and pose nearly any animal you desire , with beloved deceased pets a common commission			2
however , commemorating @entity174 in this way does not come cheap			0
the high level of skill , effort and time required means a dog costs £ 980 while a cat will set you back £ 800 and a hamster or guinea pig £ 160 .			0

@entity25 works full time as a taxidermist and teaches classes
sources all her animals ethically through road kill or farmers
eats as much of the meat as is safe in her *bid* to reduce waste
