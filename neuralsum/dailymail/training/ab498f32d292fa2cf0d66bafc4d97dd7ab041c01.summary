' we have nothing here , but we have everything			0
' these are the words used by one local to describe @entity5 's smaller , lesser - known neighbour , with whom it forms a twin island state that floats dreamily in the eastern @entity7 and which was , until independence in 1981 , @entity9			1
the island had a moment of recognition in the @entity13 when it became a favourite holiday spot of princess @entity15 's , but has otherwise remained below the radar			1
meet the outsider : @entity18 fabled @entity19 has a quiet vibe that is encapsulated by the sands of @entity22 when i say i am heading there , people mistakenly hear either ' @entity26 ' or ' @entity27 '			1
today , there are only three places to accommodate the few hundred odd guests who make it to @entity19 each year			1
the most interesting of these is @entity34 - five bungalows set on stilts over a desolate stretch of beach , accessible only by boat , on a headland at the windy northern tip of the island			1
it is to this remotest of locations that my friend @entity43 - a fellow harassed mother of single - digit - aged children - and i decamp for some winter sun and solace			1
we arrive via a @entity51 flight from @entity52 , followed by a 14 - minute white - knuckle ride on a seven - seat propeller plane from @entity5			1
after touching down on a tiny airstrip , we are whisked through the airport ( a pink hut ) and across the village of @entity59 - which was named for the @entity9 family who settled it in the 1600s and is nothing more than a few streets lined with colourful houses ( many with generations of families idling together on the doorstep ) , a grocer 's and knick - knack shops , with no traffic lights and few cars			1
a 25 - minute speedboat ride through @entity74 brings us to @entity34			2
the first thing i notice - but for the wind - is the stillness of the place			2
@entity79 , the only full - time member of staff , ambles down the dock to meet us without any of the bustle or forced solicitousness customary in these situations			2
the big brother : @entity19 sits a 15 - minute flight to the north of better known @entity5 ( pictured ) there is n't a welcoming glass of fruit punch or a cool towel in sight			1
we are deposited in our cottage with hardly a wave			0
pared down in the extreme , there are white walls , hardwood floors , green net curtains and some basic wicker furniture			0
no art on the walls			0
built by native @entity108 30 years ago , there is no sign that @entity34 has been upgraded since			0
as a tangle of @entity112 , @entity113 , @entity114 and digital camera chargers spill out of my suitcase , i wonder how well i will fit in here			0
and what on earth i will do			0
the website boasts of no spa , pool , children 's club , sushi , dancing , or watersports			0
to this list i would add that there are no menus , no wine that i wanted to drink , no housekeeping service and no hot water			0
there is also meant to be no internet , so that guests will go ' off - grid ' and truly relax			2
but , like an alcoholic sneaking his poison into rehab through a shampoo bottle , i circumvent this , procuring the back office wifi code ' for work ' and huddling in the dining room hut - the only place with a signal - for my fix			2
a place to escape the world : @entity149 found her retreat at @entity34 ( but had to beg for a wifi connection ) for most of our stay , the only other guests are an older @entity157 couple			2
' i chose this place to help my husband break his screen addiction , ' the wife tells me , winking , as i tap away on my @entity113			0
our paths cross rarely , though , as we all drift around in our enforced idleness			0
a few loungers dot the beach and we spend most of our time horizontal on these , rising every so often to re-angle ourselves towards the sun. occasionally , a stray donkey wanders past			0
meals entail appearing in the @entity171 - tiled dining hut whenever hunger ( or boredom ) strikes and being presented by @entity79 , a woman of few words and not a great deal of action , with two options scrawled on an envelope			1
offerings are whatever has been caught that day , usually @entity7 spiny lobster , conch or snapper , by ' straight ' , the friendly boat - driver			1
after a couple of days of doing my damnedest to get into the ' non-swing ' of things — lazing on the beach with a book , swimming , snorkelling and trying to space out wifi visits - i am about as relaxed as i get ( if not relaxed by @entity196 standards ) , and ready for a tour of this 62 - square - mile island			1
straight , thankfully , obliges			0
this will do for lunch : @entity149 found herself eating lobster at @entity203 's - after a little persuasion @entity19 's only ' attraction ' , besides its empty beaches , is the @entity208			1
the @entity74 is home to the largest population of @entity211 birds in the western hemisphere , who nest in their thousands amid the mangrove swamps - the males puffing out their chests into red balloons to attract mates			2
restaurants do not seem to exist on @entity19 , which has only 1,500 residents and three full - board hotels			1
an enthusiastic man tries to persuade us to eat jerk chicken from the side of the road for lunch			0
but when we , more doggedly , refuse , he - clearly amused by the high - maintenance @entity229 journalist and her blonde friend — agrees to ' call @entity203 and see if he has any lobsters '			2
@entity203 's is a simple beach hut , where we are welcomed warmly , presented with grilled lobsters and local @entity196 beers and regaled with stories			0
a few steps away is princess @entity237 , so named because of her patronage of the nearby @entity240 resort - which closed eight years ago and sits derelict			1
some locals , @entity203 included , are disappointed with its @entity243 owner , @entity242 of fashion label @entity245 , for damaging tourism by refusing to sell the land for redevelopment			0
@entity251 scenes : an encounter with a local donkey and a day on the water , on a true @entity7 gem others are relieved that @entity19 's privacy has been safeguarded			1
it does n't surprise me that this island would have been a foil to @entity15 's crazy existence			1
as i stroll along one of the famous pink sand beaches , i can imagine what a simpler life might feel like , one without deadlines and devices			0
apparently , a supermarket magnate from nearby @entity270 has just bought a large stretch of coastline , on which to build a luxury development , so @entity19 might go the blingy way of other islands - a prospect that has split local opinion , much as the closure of the @entity240 has			1
but i suppose the island can not remain under wraps for ever			2
and , though its desertedness challenged me , i am glad to have experienced it			0
next time , i might even leave my gadgets behind and just recharge myself			0
