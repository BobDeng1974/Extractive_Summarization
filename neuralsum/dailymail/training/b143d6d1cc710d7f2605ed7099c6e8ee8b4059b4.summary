difficult : ' it 's the one time since she 's died where i 've thought to myself it would be fantastic if she was here , and just how sad really for her , more than anything , not being able to see it , ' @entity2 said of his wedding day ' i sort of prepared myself beforehand so that i was sort of mentally prepared , ' he said			1
' i did n’t want any wobbly lips or anything going on , ' prince @entity2 told @entity16 in the interview ahead of the celebrations in honour of the @entity15 's 60 - year reign			1
' it was the one time since she 's died where i 've thought to myself it would be fantastic if she was here			2
and just how sad really , for her more than anything , not being able to see it			0
' i think she would have loved the day and i think , hopefully , she ’d be very proud of us both for the day			1
i ’m just very sad that she ’s never going to get a chance to meet @entity12			1
' for @entity41 too it was a poignant moment , as he felt his mother 's absence acutely , knowing especially that ' she would have loved @entity12			1
' ' i think she had the best seat in the house probably , ' @entity41 said			1
' she would have loved to have been there			2
' @entity41 , who acted as his brother 's best man , also confessed he was ' massively nervous ' on his brother 's wedding day			1
' everybody was nervous , ' he said			0
' the whole thing was a bit of a blur to be honest because there was @entity58 knows how many millions or billions of eyes focused on us			0
luckily , mainly those two			0
' south of the border : prince @entity41 was in @entity62 as a part of the @entity65 tour when he met with @entity16 the two billion pairs of eyes did n't go unnoticed by @entity2 either			1
recalling his wedding day he said : ' honestly it was one of those days where you feel very elated			2
also completely terrified , i have to be honest			0
the prospect of two billion people watching was quite daunting			0
' a new biography of the prince has claimed that the future king was so scarred by his parent 's failed marriage that he worried whether he could be faithful to one woman			2
according to royal biographer @entity80 , the author of ' prince @entity2 : the man who will be @entity84 ' , prince @entity81 and princess @entity3 's highly publicised affairs contributed to prince @entity2 's delayed marriage proposal to now - wife @entity12			1
' the problem was @entity2 : he had very real worries about whether it was possible to love just one woman			1
after his hurricane childhood , he was understandably cautious about committing to a relationship , ' @entity80 writes in the book			0
@entity16 , who later confessed she had been ' trepidatious ' to bring up the subject of @entity3 because it was ' so personal and private ' , also talked to the princes about their relationship with the @entity15			1
the stories that the heirs to the throne shared shows that they have a very close bond with her , one that is much more normal than expected			0
' i still think she 's just my grandmother , really , ' prince @entity2 told the @entity13 interviewer when asked if he remembers a specific moment when he realised that his grandmother was not like everyone else 's			1
but continued , admitting : '' when i was younger and my parents used to always slap my hand if i was picking my nose or if i was running around screaming i was told to shut up			2
and i sort of understood that when i was around her i needed to be a little but more low key and little bit more polite			0
' emotional scarring : a new biography about the prince claims that he was so affected by his parents ' highly publicised affairs he doubted he could be faithful to one woman looking back at the incredible challenge facing their grandmother who took the throne at the age of 25 back in what prince @entity2 referred to as a ' man 's world ' , both the princes were equally as admiring			1
talking to @entity16 in @entity62 , the younger of the two said he could n't imagine , even at 27 , taking on the responsibility that the @entity15 did in 1953			1
' this tour itself has been a brief insight as to what she had to deal with at a very young age , ' @entity41 said			2
' what she 's achieved and what she 's done and at the age of 25 , confronted with the world 's media			0
you can see it in her face now			0
you can see it in the way that she parades herself is just so immaculate			0
' when it comes to family though , he said his grandmother is ' really very very normal			0
she obviously takes a huge interest in what we all do , that 's her children as well as her grandchildren			0
' she wants to know which charities we 're supporting , how life is going in our jobs and such			0
so you know , she has a vested interested in what we do			0
' poignant : @entity41 and @entity2 , pictured with their mother in 1993 , said it was ' difficult ' not to have their mother with them on the day and it seems her interests go beyond what her own twenty - something grandsons are up to			1
joking about the @entity15 's @entity174 page , he lamented that she had n't ' friended ' him yet and asked @entity16 whether she had received any friend requests from his grandmother herself			1
' she 's managed to get the family to move with the times and i think that 's incredibly important			0
you ca n't get stuck in an old age situation when everything else around you is changing so you have to go with it , ' he said approvingly			0
from @entity2 's description of his first meeting to discuss the royal wedding , it would appear however , that when it comes to business versus family , @entity190 's monarch does not waste time in prioritising			2
' i was given a list in the first meeting , of 777 names , and not one of them on there i knew , ' he recalled			2
' and i was n't too happy about it so i rang her for a bit of moral support , and a bit of back up , and she said " do n't be so ridiculous			0
get rid of the list and start from your friends			1
