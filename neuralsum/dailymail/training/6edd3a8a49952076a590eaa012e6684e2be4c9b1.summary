by @entity0 watch out @entity2 , there is a new footballing power on the march in east @entity5			2
that is the message @entity7 believes his sale of @entity9 to @entity11 businessman @entity10 has sent to the @entity13 side			1
@entity10 , the head of renewable energy and waste management firm the @entity16 , acquired the club earlier this week and @entity7 , who has been made @entity9 ’s honorary president , believes that the takeover will allow @entity9 to compete with their @entity13 neighbours			1
' this guy can do anything he wants to do if he has the belief and passion			2
as a fan i do n’t think i have been more excited in 20 years about what could happen to this football club			1
it is what dreams are made of			2
' @entity10 was at @entity38 in may when @entity9 were pipped to promotion to the @entity40 by @entity41 on penalties in the @entity44 play - off final , and the new owner has backed manager @entity46 to go one better this season			1
' i am already envisioning a @entity40 club , ' @entity10 said			1
even this year something can happen			0
we have to forget that penalty and we have to start from zero again			0
so near yet so far : @entity9 missed out on promotion to the @entity40 on penalties to @entity41 ' @entity46 was told to give us a list of players and tell us in which position you need reinforcement			1
for every role you need give me a list of five players and give us the priorities			0
one minute later he was given permission to start negotiating with the first players on the list			0
i think he is still hard at work now			0
' i am a little bit meticulous – the list will have to be signed by him			0
he did n’t hesitate – at the end of the season we will go over that list again and assess whether those were the right priorities			2
' @entity10 , who has never previously owned a football club , chose to buy @entity9 over @entity75 and @entity76 because for its lack of debt and @entity5 location			1
' we decided to invest in football in @entity82 as this is the top notch industry in the world , ' he said			0
' it was difficult to find a team whose accounts are in order – we did not want to settle other peoples ’ debts			0
ambitious : @entity10 is targeting promotion in his first season at the club ' @entity9 has a long and great history and roots are important to us			1
@entity5 is one of the most important centres of the world and the team deserves a higher position			0
these factors brought our focus to @entity9			2
last week @entity9 settled their dispute with the @entity13 about @entity2 ’s move to the @entity107 , with @entity10 confirming that the club would remain at their @entity25 home in @entity110 for the foreseeable future			1
' generally i never look at what others do			0
i am focused on our project and i think that if our project is strong and everything is properly planned everything will happen naturally , ' @entity10 said			1
room to manouevre : manager @entity46 has already given @entity10 a list of transfer targets ' if we have the right passion no one else will compromise our success			2
if we have the right dose of passion maybe other people will be worried about us			0
let ’s focus on the present			0
we have a stadium now , we have to think about the people who will come to our stadium and transmit their passion to our players ' while @entity7 sold his 90 per cent stake in the club to @entity10 earlier this week the boxing promoter still owns the stadium , which the @entity11 has the option of purchasing in two years ’ time			1
@entity10 also confirmed that a deal is ' 99 per cent ' complete to appoint former @entity141 and @entity143 defender @entity142 as @entity9 ’s sporting director			1
' he has a great desire to work in @entity5 and will support us and support @entity46 , ' the chairman said .			0
