the @entity1 faithful were introduced to four new heroes making their home debuts			2
so how did the quartet all do ? @entity6 's @entity5 gives his expert opinion ... @entity8 - 8/10 @entity9 likes to have someone who can run with the ball , and @entity12 certainly does that			1
his dribbling gelled the team and helped shift defence to attack			0
@entity18 , @entity19 and @entity20 could all move while his movement stretched @entity22			2
@entity8 celebrates his goal as he impressed on his @entity1 debut for @entity25 especially dangerous when he runs with the ball , @entity8 helps @entity25 turn defence into attack he showed excellent technique and vision with his passing and he looked much more collective in his play - at @entity33 he too often tried to be the main man			1
he knows how important it is to capture the hearts of the home fans and certainly did that with this performance			0
@entity8 shakes hands with manager @entity9 after his man of the match performance @entity42 - 6/10 it was good that he did n’t arrive on the pitch needing to score a winner			1
he still looked tentative after his injury and will have to ease in			0
he made some good runs and had one chance but is still not at his sharpest			0
@entity42 could have , and probably should have , scored on his debut for @entity25 @entity42 had the @entity1 crowd in raptures before he even took to the pitch @entity20 made way for @entity42 ( above ) as he made his first appearance for @entity25 @entity56 - 7.5/10 an interesting footballer who almost acts as @entity9 ’s brains on the pitch			1
he is trusted by his former @entity60 and now club manager and showed great defensive intelligence to protect and press forward if needed			0
acted as a feeder at the base of the midfield , keeping passes short on the grass			0
@entity60 star @entity56 impressed as he provided cover for @entity25 's back four along with precise and uncomplicated short passing , @entity56 was an asset in defence @entity75 - 6.5/10 slotted in nicely and covered his centre backs well			1
the change of system worked well and @entity75 kept things tidy , showed good pace and strength and was happy to get forward			2
@entity75 was a well - balance addition to @entity25 's defence and kept things tidy @entity86 pleased to join one of the best			1

@entity8 , @entity42 , @entity56 and @entity75 made their @entity1 debuts against @entity22
@entity25 won 4 - 0 with goals from @entity12 , @entity92 , @entity18 and @entity20
@entity12 was the star man for @entity25 , especially when running with the ball
@entity42 came off the bench but appeared to look tentative still
blind is almost like @entity9 's brains on the pitch
@entity75 slotted in well and kept things tidy at the back for the @entity104
