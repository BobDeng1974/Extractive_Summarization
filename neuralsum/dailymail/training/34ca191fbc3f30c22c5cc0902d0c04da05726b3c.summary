the number of birds and hedgehogs in the @entity3 has fallen dramatically as a result of climate change and extreme weather , according to a new report			1
the hedgehog population has dropped from 36million in 1950 to just one million today meaning the species is facing the same rapid decline as the tiger			2
during the last 50 years numbers of birds have also fallen by 44million			1
warmer winters have affected species including hedgehogs and dormice , causing them to come out of hibernation at the wrong time of year			1
populations of wildfowl birds including @entity22 ’s swans , which winter in the @entity3 , have also declined , while the @entity24 ’s golden plover is vulnerable as warmer conditions reduce the crane flies available for chicks to feed on			1
in decline : hedgehog numbers have dropped from 36million in 1950 to just one million today thousands of puffins starved to death this year after the coldest march on record for 50 years			1
a new report by living with @entity34 ( @entity35 ) has drawn together the latest evidence to provide information on the impact of climate change on the countryside now and in the future			0
many spring events , from frog spawning to leaves appearing on trees , bird eggs hatching and flowers blossoming are happening earlier , with the danger that the life - cycles of dependent species are becoming out of sync , the ‘ terrestrial biodiversity climate change impacts report card ’ drawn up for the government said			2
the report also revealed many dragonflies , butterflies and woodlice are moving their ranges north , while new species of insect have colonised the @entity3 from @entity61			1
and mountain plants which are adapted to colder conditions are at risk from a warming climate , as warmth - loving species colonise their habitats in response to higher temperatures			0
but higher winter temperatures in the past two decades have contributed to higher survival rates among some breeding bird species , the report card said			0
climate change is also responsible for new pests and diseases which are having a major impact on the @entity3 ’s trees			1
too early : changing temperatures are causing dormice to come out of hibernation at the wrong time trees are being hit by dangers such as the oak processionary moth , which can cause breathing problems in people			0
and the @entity3 ’s climate will become more suitable to invasive pests and diseases , including those which have an impact on a wide range of native plant species , the report said			2
dr @entity96 , from @entity97 , who led the development of the overview , said : ‘ this report card shows strong evidence from a large number of different scientific studies that the natural world has started to respond to climate change over the last few decades			0
‘ it also shows the range and complexity of these changes : some species and habitats are much more sensitive than others			0
‘ this is a challenge for conservation and we need to adapt our approach to reduce the risks and take advantage of any opportunities			0
‘ it is also another wake - up call about the seriousness of tackling climate change			0

@entity3 bird numbers have also dropped by 44million in the last 50 years
