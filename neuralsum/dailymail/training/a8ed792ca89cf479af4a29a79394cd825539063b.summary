a @entity1 photographer has given a unique glimpse into what actually makes the internet run			1
@entity1 artist and designer @entity5 was given unprecedented access to the usually secret and highly secure data centres behind many of the world 's biggest online services			1
@entity12 phone firm @entity11 's 65,700 square meter data center in @entity14 , @entity12 , one of the biggest in @entity16			1
he described them as : ' deafeningly noisy rooms cocooning racks of servers and routers			2
in these spaces you are buffeted by hot and cold air that blusters through everything			0
' located in the town of @entity35 , near @entity36 , the centre includes 23 it rooms and a built area of 65,700 square meters			1
each module of the data centre will be independent , allowing new rooms to be activated without affecting the operation of the rest			1
similarly , the @entity44 of it power for each room can be multiplied up to fourfold without impacting the housed systems			0
the vast building costs € 300 million according to @entity11			1
the pictures were taken alongside a high definition film @entity51 is set to show in @entity52 on three giant screens which wrap around visitors to give them a sense of the scale of the building			2
the vast building costs € 300 million according to @entity11			1
located in the town of @entity35 , near @entity36 , the centre includes 23 it rooms and a built area of 65,700 square meters			1
each module of the data centre will be independent , allowing new rooms to be activated without affecting the operation of the rest			2
similarly , the @entity44 of it power for each room can be multiplied up to fourfold without impacting the housed systems			0
' internet machine documents one of the largest , most secure and ‘ fault - tolerant ’ data - centres in the world , run by @entity11 in @entity14 , @entity12 , ' @entity5 said			1
' the film explores these hidden architectures with a wide , slowly moving camera			0
' the subtle changes in perspective encourage contemplative reflection on the spaces where internet data and connectivity are being managed			2
' power to keep the servers running is supplied not only through the mains , but backed up with warm caverns of lead batteries , managed by gently buzzing cabinets of relays and switches , said @entity5			2
server rooms are kept cool through corridors that divide the huge space			1
there are fibre optic connections routed through multiple , redundant , paths across the building			0
in the basement , these cables connect to the wider internet through holes in rough concrete walls			0
@entity5 said he hoped the film would allow people to see ' the loud ' as a more physical object			2
' in this film i wanted to look beyond the childish myth of ‘ the cloud ’ , to investigate what the infrastructures of the internet actually look like			2
' it felt important to be able to see and hear the energy that goes into powering these machines , and the associated systems for securing , cooling and maintaining them			0
' ' what we find , after being led through layers of identification and security far higher than any airport , are deafeningly noisy rooms cocooning racks of servers and routers , ' said @entity5			1
power is supplied not only through the mains , but backed up with lead batteries			0
in turn these are backed up in turn by rows of yellow generators so that the data centre can run indefinitely until power returns			0
giant stainless steel water tanks , containing tens of thousands of litres of cool water , are positioned outside in case of fire , while the roof has a football - pitch sized array of ‘ chillers ’ that filter and cool the air going into the building			0
rows of yellow generators with diesel storage tanks			0
the centre has contracts with fuel supply companies so it can run indefinitely in the even of a power failure			0
walls are fitted with special mountings so racks or servers and the equipment needed to control and monitor them can be fitted			0
a server room waiting to be filled : @entity5 said he wandered the halls for miles , and said the server rooms felt like ' entering an intensive care unit at a hospital			1

giant server rooms handle much of @entity16 ’s cloud *computing* services for @entity11 *clients*
