@entity4 was at a @entity20 bar during the @entity9 - @entity12 game with his wife when they each wagered that if the other 's team won , they 'd be in for a shock			1
@entity4 's @entity9 won 27 - 20 and he took his spoils by repeatedly tasering wife @entity28			1
she would eventually call the police , landing @entity4 behind bars with a possible six - year sentence for carrying the weapon , which is illegal in @entity20 without a permit			1
@entity35 called the cops on her husband just after midnight early tuesday			0
she told dispatchers her husband had thrown their dog out of the semi-truck they were sharing as their home and then locked her out too			0
earlier that night , she said , her husband had tasered her on the buttocks and leg when the @entity12 lost			2
@entity28 told police she had n't consented to the @entity46			0
but when police reviewed footage on her cell phone , they found her laughing with her arms up as her husband administered the shock			0
' it seemed apparent that ms. @entity35 had consented , ' reads the @entity55 's report obtained by the @entity56			2
as @entity28 waited in the squad car , @entity4 consented to a search of their truck and police found a stun gun			1
crying wolf ? the @entity9 - @entity12 game was close one and ended with a 27 - 20 win for @entity4 's team , the @entity9			1

the looselipped @entity4 told police , without their asking , that they 'd gotten into a fight not because she 'd been smoking marijuana in the bathroom at the sports bar			0
his wife , @entity4 told the police , smoked too much of the stuff and it hinders her from keeping a job			2
while police had determined that no domestic violence was involved , they still needed to address the stun gun			0
@entity4 did not have the required permit for the weapon , an offense that could earn him up to 6 years in jail			1
and after all that , @entity35 declined to even press charges against her husband			0
oops : though police determined that no domestic violence had occurred , @entity4 had another problem			0
he consented to a search of the truck the couple live in and police found a stun gun			0
@entity4 had no license , which means up to 6 years in jail in @entity20			1

taser wager : @entity4 , *42* , of @entity112 , bet his wife the @entity9 would beat the @entity12 in monday night 's game
after a 27 - 20 *nailbiter* , the @entity9 took it and @entity4 *claimed* his prize : he got to taser wife @entity35
@entity28 *changed* her mind and got @entity4 arrested , now he could spend up to 6 years in *prison* for *possession* of the *gadget* in @entity20
