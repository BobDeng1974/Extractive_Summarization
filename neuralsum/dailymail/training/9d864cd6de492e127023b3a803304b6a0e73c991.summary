by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 05:26 est , 25 september 2013 updated : 08:18 est , 25 september 2013 @entity3 has abandoned his flagship promise to cut vat , @entity2 admitted today			1
the £ 12billion plan was the centrepiece of @entity3 ’s so - called plan for jobs and growth and still features prominently on its website			1
but mr @entity2 was accused of ‘ rank hypocrisy ’ after claiming the economic circumstances have changed so he would not now promise to cut vat at the next election			1
reversal : labour leader @entity2 admitted he would not cut vat at the next election , despite it still being a promise on his party 's website @entity3 faced heavy criticism for the policy , after mr @entity2 admitted in april that it would lead to a rise in borrowing			1
@entity5 was increased from 17.5 per cent to 20 per cent soon after the coalition was formed			1
on the @entity3 website the party boasts that is has a ' clear five - point plan for jobs , to help struggling families and support small businesses '			1
the plan also included a £ 2billion tax on bankers ' bonuses , bringing forward investment projects , cutting vat on home improvements to five per cent and a one - year national insurance tax break			2
it promises : ' reversing the @entity41 - led @entity40 's damaging vat rise now for a temporary period - a £ 450 boost for a couple with children - immediate help for our high streets and for struggling families and pensioners			1
' policy : @entity3 's plan for jobs still features prominently on the party 's website but has been quietly ditched broken promise : families were told a @entity3 government would make them £ 450 better off but today mr @entity2 insisted it was not party policy			1
he told @entity60 's today programme : ‘ there is n't going to be a cut in @entity5 , that 's not what we are proposing at the moment			0
‘ that 's because the economic position has changed			1
we have always said as recovery took hold our focus would not be on a cut in vat			0
‘ i think it would have been the right thing to do , it would have been a better approach in getting the deficit down			0
i would make the point the government has n't succeeded in getting the deficit down			0
‘ that 's part of the issue we will have to be dealing with			0
’ @entity41 treasury minister @entity81 seized on the admission , claiming it demolished @entity3 's credibility on the economy			2
' this is the final nail in the coffin for @entity2 and @entity89 ’ economic policy , ' he said			1
' for the last three years a £ 12 billion vat cut has been the central plank of @entity3 ’s argument , and by abandoning it they are admitting that their argument has collapsed			2
' all they are left with is unworkable and unfunded policies – meaning more spending , more borrowing and more debt			0
that ’s exactly what got us into a mess in the first place			0
' and it ’s hardworking people who would pay the price through higher taxes and higher mortgage rates			2
' mr @entity2 said he was still committed to matching the coalition ’s overall spending plans			1
‘ in 2015/16 , we envisage cuts in public spending , ’ he said			0
‘ that 's what we 've been clear about , by sticking to the government 's day - to - day spending plans			0
we have said we will make different choices on spending and revenue but sticking to that overall plan			0
’ but the reversal on the vat cut was seized on by political opponents			0
@entity128 spokesman @entity127 said : ‘ @entity3 have spent the last three years aggressively attacking the @entity129 for raising vat			2
‘ now they admit they wo n’t reduce it			0
this is rank hypocrisy from a party that has no answers to the big questions of the day – how to fix the economy , create jobs and help people with the cost of living			1
‘ @entity141 have taken tough decisions in the national interest in order to clean up @entity3 ’s mess , and @entity3 has called us every name under the sun for doing so			2
‘ they have been utterly shameless and deeply hypocritical			0
