most hoteliers have stories to tell about demanding , stroppy guests whose manners leave a lot to be desired			0
@entity5 , who runs an upmarket establishment in the heart of the @entity8 , is no exception			1
the morning i visit , @entity11 — the guest in the hotel 's most exclusive suite — was so eager for his room - service lunch that he launched himself at poor @entity5 , swiping the plate clean out of her hand before rudely eating his lovingly prepared tuna dish from the floor			1
as for @entity20 — in a cheaper room down the corridor — well , he 's already knocked his tv over and is making a racket as he sulkily kicks his remote control around the room			2
but none of it fazes @entity5			1
nothing is too much trouble for her pampered guests , whether they have special dietary requirements , want to make @entity33 calls to loved ones ... or just have their noses stroked and their tummies tickled			0
@entity37 - fect : feline guests at @entity39 get their own human - sized beds creature comforts : the rooms are equipped with toys , beds and even a tv yes , the residents at this upmarket hotel may be somewhat lacking in manners , but they 're not rowdy rock stars or drunken travelling salesmen			1
they are cats — much - loved family pets whose owners ca n't bear the thought of putting them in a cattery when they go away			1
hotel cat has been officially open for business for only a month , and it still has that fresh paint smell			1
at first glance , it could be a very select boutique hotel for humans — the kind you read about in glossy magazines			2
the reception area is clean and airy with a vase of brightly coloured flowers			0
the main hallway is lit by chandeliers , while a 6ft christmas tree sparkles with fairy lights			0
it 's not until you peer a little closer into the rooms and clock the toy mice , scratching posts and climbing frames that you realise who it 's catering for			2
hotel cat is the brainchild of @entity5 and @entity83 , who ran a dog hotel in @entity85 along similar lines			1
they sold up , bought a 20 - acre property in @entity89 , and describe themselves as ' the world 's worst farmers ' — buying animals and becoming too attached ever to slaughter or work them			2
no expense spared : it costs between £ 19 and £ 34 a night for cats to stay in their own suite pets deserve to be pampered : the hotel was the brainchild of @entity5 and @entity83 who were shocked by the way cats were treated in some catteries today they play host to a menagerie of chickens , ponies , sheep , goats and donkeys			1
it was after visiting a regular cattery earlier this year that @entity5 realised the moggies have been missing out			1
she tells me : ' it was a well - known cattery , but i was appalled at the conditions the animals were kept in			1
' the runs , in which they spend 24 hours , were tiny			0
they had no room to roam , explore or play			0
for a cat used to being outdoors , it would be particularly stressful			2
' at least dogs in boarding kennels are taken out and walked every day , but cats are pretty much just fed and forgotten about			0
' our three cats are so much a part of the family , and i hated the idea of them being locked up like that			0
' instead @entity5 and @entity83 — who are helped out by their two animal - mad teenagers , @entity138 , 18 , and @entity139 , 16 — ploughed their savings into creating this top notch home - away - from - home for cats			1
the hotel comprises seven rooms , all ' en suite ' — in that each leads to a private play area via a cat flap home - from - home : the family used their savings to make the hotel for cats a reality fun : the rooms contain every type of cat toy you can think of , from giant foam fish to plastic snakes and furry animals hotel cat is a lavishly converted barn a stone 's throw from the family 's home			1
it comprises seven rooms , all ' en suite ' — in that each leads to a private play area via a cat flap			1
costing between £ 19 and £ 34 a night , all suites have a flat - screen tv and dvd player , cushions and a proper human bed — not a basket — with a duvet and blanket			1
the rooms contain every type of cat toy you can think of , from giant foam fish to plastic snakes and furry animals			1
bedrooms are heated to a tropical @entity191 and there 's a choice of entertainment , from movies to music			0
i would n't have thought your average cat was too fussed about entertainment , but the occupiers of the @entity201 prove me wrong			2
@entity11 , a silver tabby , is transfixed by @entity203 , playing on his dvd			2
' they respond to the sound and moving images , ' says @entity5			1
' people always assume cats just take care of themselves			0
it 's true that cats are much lower maintenance than dogs , but they 're not total loners			0
' @entity11 shares his suite with @entity217 and @entity218 , a pair of short - haired @entity220 with whom he usually lives in @entity221			1
peace of mind : owners know their cats are being well - cared for while they go away relaxed : this cat clearly finds his bed comfortable following a bedtime story luxury : all the rooms have en suites and room service serving seafood canapes the trio have been at @entity39 for six months — before it officially opened — as their owners , a solicitor and his wife , are caught in the middle of a complicated house move			1
by my reckoning it 's cost more than £ 8,000 , which would buy you a week in a suite at the @entity248			1
but what price peace of mind ? @entity5 emails owners weekly bulletins , detailing their cats ' health , mood and food intake			2
and when it comes to food , the @entity39 lives up to its five - star billing			0
there are seafood canapés from £ 4 , or smoked salmon and prawns in seafood sauce for £ 6			0
all dishes are served with mineral water ( no cloudy tap water for these @entity270 )			0
wish you were here : @entity5 emails owners weekly bulletins , detailing their cats ' health , mood and food intake or they can @entity33 despite the expense , @entity39 is fully booked for @entity279			2
residents can expect to wake up to a stocking filled with presents , followed by a gourmet turkey dinner			0
' the message is loud and clear , ' @entity5 says			2
' owners really dislike traditional catteries			0
so many people have said : ' finally we can go on holiday without worrying			0
' with that , she starts her wind - down routine for her guests			0
soothing music is played , lights are dimmed , litter trays are emptied , and the cats are gently stroked while bedtime stories are read			0
never mind the animals , this place is the cat 's whiskers .			0
