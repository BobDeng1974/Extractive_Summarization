by @entity0 published : 12:32 est , 26 february 2014 @entity2 : 15:22 est , 26 february 2014 the drought in @entity4 is causing farmland to die , and threatening the water supplies of rural communities , but it 's been a godsend for modern gold miners			1
prospectors say the drought is causing a second @entity13 , since extremely low water levels are opening up areas never mined before			1
' a lot of time you would just see a husband			0
now you â€™re seeing the whole family out , ' @entity20 , of the @entity21 , told @entity24			0
like 1849 all over again : low water levels in @entity4 's historic drought are opening up areas never touched by miners and causing what prospectors are calling a second @entity13 lucky strike : beginners can expect to find anywhere between $ 5 and $ 200 worth of gold in these ' untouched ' areas the first @entity13 began in 1848 when deposits of the precious metal were discovered in @entity36 , @entity4			1
that set off a mass migration , with some 300,000 people ( forty - niners ) from all over the @entity40 and world coming to @entity4 with the hopes of striking it rich			2
in the first five years of the @entity13 , an estimated 12million ounces of gold were mined - worth more than $ 16million today - but the rush soon fizzled out			0
get rich quick : more than 300,000 people migrated to @entity4 during the @entity13 of 1849 , but the previous metal deposits mostly dried up by 1855 with the current drought , modern prospectors say they 're digging in places never touched by the forty - niners			1
@entity20 points out several places on @entity53 , just 60 miles from @entity54 , that would have been inaccessible just a few years ago because of swift water			0
' i 'm 50 - some odd years old and i have never had water levels in this area this low , ' he said			1
brief : the second @entity13 may be over as soon as it started though			1
rain is expected to his the @entity54 area this weekend with the heaviest rainfall on friday morning into the afternoon more prospectors have been coming out to the creek in recent weeks with pans , slough boxes and metal detectors than is usual for the winter			2
@entity13 is currently selling for $ 1300 a troy ounce , and @entity20 says beginners can make anywhere between $ 5 and $ 200 a day			0
but this second @entity13 may be over as soon as it started			2
a storm is set to hit southern @entity4 friday and could last all weekend , with the heaviest rainfall expected friday morning into the afternoon , according to the @entity74			2
record drought : these satellite images show the parched @entity4 landscape this year compared to a normal year with plenty of foliage and snow coverage last year today : @entity4 's drought continues to worsen , with ten rural communities identified as having fewer than 60 days ' supply of water parched : water levels for many of @entity4 's major reservoirs are well below average and dropping ; concern is mounting that @entity4 may be headed for a replay of the big drought of the late 1980s through the early 1990s , or even worse , 1977 this has local authorities worried about mudslides and traffic accidents with so much rain in such a short period of time			1
since july , @entity54 has received just 1.2 inches of rain , which means there 's been a build - up of oil on the roads that will become slick once wet			1
it 's also a cause for concern for residents living in hilly areas			0
many residents in @entity109 took off work tuesday just to protect their homes from the expected storm			0
getting ready : residents in @entity109 pictured sandbagging their homes in preparation for the storm cause for concern : so much rain in a short amount of time has emergency officials fearing mudslides in the area @entity109 city manager @entity122 told the @entity123 that the storm is a cause for concern , comparing the weather conditions to a similar event in 1968 which led to extremely damaging mudflows			0
despite the dangers , the rain will be celebrated across the state where water supplies have become dangerous low			2
images released by @entity135 comparing a full @entity136 in july 2011 to last month show just how desperate the situation is			0
the drought is causing a serious economic consequences for the state since much of the nation 's most successful farmland is going to waste because there is n't any water to keep the fields alive			0
before : in 2011 , the @entity147 dam was almost full , sitting at a capacity of 97 percent after : the capacity of @entity136 last month was just 17 percent , a whopping 80 percent lower than what it was 2.5 years ago @entity4 is under the influence of a persistent upper - level ridge of high pressure anchored off its north coast that has kept the region generally warm , dry and @entity157 four miles high and 2,000 miles long , is to blame for the emerging drought as the mass of high air pressure has been blocking @entity162 winter storms from coming ashore and bringing much needed to bring rain to the parched @entity165 mass of high air pressure has been blocking @entity162 winter storms from coming ashore in @entity4 , pushing them into @entity169 and @entity170 - it is even responsible for rain and cold weather to the @entity174 high - pressure zones pop up all the time during most winters , but they usually break down , allowing rain to get through to @entity178 duration of its presence - 13 months - is unprecedented in modern weather records and puzzling researchers - it has been named the ' ridiculously resilient ridge			1
' source : @entity184 - @entity183 a dead almond crop is seen in @entity4 's @entity187 in @entity188 , @entity147 @entity135 scientists have begun deploying satellites and other advanced technology to help @entity4 water officials assess the state 's record drought and better manage it			1

@entity4 has received just 1.2 inches of rain since july
the drought has caused extremely low water levels in local creeks which is bad for farming but good news for modern prospectors
these prospectors are now able to dig in areas never touched in the *original* @entity13 of 1849
but the ' second @entity13 ' may be over as soon as it started with rain forecast for friday
