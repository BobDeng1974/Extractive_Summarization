by @entity0 last updated at 2:09 pm on 26th january 2012 when a demolition team began work at a derelict @entity5 guest house they all agreed that something did n't feel quite right			1
one day , they claimed , a chandelier suddenly started swinging on its own , which understandably left the burly builders feeling slightly unsettled			0
but it was only when one of the team took a photograph of the building that they suddenly became convinced they had not been working alone			1
bizarre : builders took this picture of a guest house they were demolishing and noticed this ghost - like figure			1
@entity21 is certain that it is his mother @entity23 , who worked at the guest house back from the dead : @entity26 worked at @entity27			1
her son believes she may have appeared to protest at the demolition of the building the image appears to show the ghostly outline of a woman at the window of @entity27 , in @entity35 , @entity36			1
after researching the history of the building they realised the chilling significance of what they ’d photographed			1
the ghostly image was an eerie likeness of @entity26 who worked at the guest house and died almost a year ago			1
bizarrely , she stood for hours at that very same window taking bookings			1
her son , and former resident @entity21 , says he had no doubt that the ghostly woman is his late mother			2
he believes she may have appeared to protest at the demolition of @entity27 , the building she loved			1
' that is my mother			0
i ’m totally convinced - no one else looks like that			0
' she had glasses and big earrings and she used to wear a dress with a bow at the front , ' he said			0
' she used to stand in that room for hours on the phone - it was the guest house reception and she took bookings from there			1
' mr @entity21 , a 59 - year - old managing director , who now lives in @entity72 , added : ' she would have been horrified if she had known the house was being demolished because it was beautiful , so maybe that is why she ’s turned up			2
' demolition supervisor @entity76 , 38 , of @entity77 , took the photograph of the house shortly before it was knocked down , earlier this week			1
' it was n’t until i got home and showed my wife that we spotted the woman , ' he said			0
' you can see the jewellery on her and everything			0
i ’ve always been a sceptic but i ’ll have to believe in ghosts now			0
' colleague @entity91 , 34 , from @entity92 , @entity93 , said : ' the day before we took the photo we were stripping the building inside and i noticed the chandelier swinging on its own			2
' we said at the time the place felt strange			0
' my hairs were standing on end when i saw the photo			0
i believe it is a ghost			0
' left feeling strange : demolition worker @entity76 with @entity91 , right , and @entity104 , left			2
mr @entity76 took the picture of the house which revealed the ghostly image demolition worker @entity104 , of @entity108 , @entity93 , said the ghostly sighting made him feel slightly strange about their role in taking down old buildings			1
' it makes you wonder what we could possibly unearth , ' he said			0
@entity117 , of @entity35 contractors @entity119 and @entity120 , said the five - gabled building , which was originally a dentist ’s in the early 1900s , has been taken down to be replaced with a new commercial property			2
he said he could not explain the image of the woman			0
' there was only a black wall behind the window , we had taken everything out - there were no visible features or anything with a skin colour			2
' destroyed : @entity21 said his late mother would have been horrified if she had known the house was being demolished pleasant : how @entity27 looked before it was demolished			0

@entity26 would stand for hours at the guest house window awaiting *visitors* and taking bookings on the phone
her son believes she appeared to protest against the demolition of the building she loved
