by @entity0 the @entity2 team got some motivation help from explorer and adventurer @entity5 during a sailing outing near their camp on @entity10 ’s @entity9 coast on tuesday			1
@entity5 talked about his exploits , which include the solo circumnavigation of the @entity13 and a @entity15 expedition			1
@entity17 captain @entity16 was impressed , saying it was ‘ incredible what the human body can achieve			1
’ making waves ! @entity17 stars @entity22 ( @entity23 ) and @entity24 enjoy a day jet skiing ahead of the @entity26 land ahoy ! @entity28 ( @entity23 ) on the boat '' @entity29 '' of adventurer @entity5 in @entity31 , @entity10 life 's a beach : @entity17 players including @entity35 ( @entity23 ) and @entity16 ( @entity36 ) walk on the sand in @entity10 ship shape : @entity17 players were given a motivational talk from @entity13 explorer @entity5 aboard his boat @entity16 says the presentation by the @entity46 - born @entity45 explorer showed that , ‘ we must be well prepared , and have to respect the opponent			1
’ @entity16 also admitted he is not sure where he will play in the @entity2 side at the @entity26			2
injuries are forcing coach @entity52 to have another look at his options - forward @entity55 has been ruled out for three months after injuring his ankle in a warm game against @entity58			1
the attacking midfielder suffered partial ligament tear in his left ankle after a tussle with @entity63 during his side 's 6 - 1 victory			2
consequently , @entity16 is likely to be fielded as a defensive midfielder in @entity10 rather than in his usual and preferred position as right back			2
@entity16 says it ’s the coach ’s decision and that he is ready to play in whatever position he ’s thrown into			2
but putting @entity17 ’s top defender in midfield could weaken the already suspect back four of @entity52 ’s team			1
@entity75 style : @entity76 and @entity77 ( front , @entity79 ) walk on the beach in the village of @entity31 smile : goalkeeper @entity83 ( @entity23 ) poses for a picture with fans as he walks with his @entity17 teammates cold facts : @entity5 talked about his exploits , which include the solo circumnavigation of the @entity15 @entity16 played as a defensive midfielder a lot this season for @entity93 , also because of injuries to his teammates , and filled the role surprisingly well			1
that has led @entity52 to test his captain in the new role and that ’s where he played in the final warm - up match , a 6 - 1 win over @entity58			2
‘ you assume that if you played in one position in the final friendly , you will also play in the same position at the @entity26 , ’ @entity16 said			2
‘ of course i ’ve spoken to the coach a lot , but it will be up to him to disclose what we discussed			0
at the end , it ’s his decision in which position i play			0
’ @entity16 became @entity17 captain four years ago , when @entity114 got injured and had to miss the @entity115 in @entity46			1
@entity116 never recalled @entity114 and @entity16 stayed as captain			0
‘ nothing much has changed since then , except that i now have more experience			0
your authority comes from your performance on the field , ’ he said			0
back to front : @entity16 may be moved into his new midfield position after @entity55 ' injury down and out : @entity55 has been ruled out for three months after injuring his ankle in a warm up game blow : @entity17 coach @entity52 watches as @entity55 is taken off during their friendly against @entity58 by moving into midfield , @entity16 may squeeze out @entity28 from the starting lineup			1
@entity28 has been bothered by a knee injury and may not be fully fit for the june 16 opener against @entity136 in @entity137 sustained an ankle injury in the final club match of the season and missed most of the training camp			1
but the captain says he is ready now			0
‘ i am fine , my foot is ok , i can play , ’ he said			0
@entity52 usually uses two defensive midfielders and usually they are @entity28 and @entity145			1
but @entity145 is only coming back after missing six months with a knee injury and @entity116 is unlikely to risk playing both with doubts about their fitness			0
but strengthening the midfield could expose the defense			0
@entity76 would then move to @entity16 ’s position as right back			0
but he normally plays as a central defender at @entity93 and feels more comfortable in that role			0
sacrifice : @entity28 could lose his place in central midfield to accommodate @entity16 shuffling the pack : @entity145 has just returned from injury while @entity76 may be drafted in @entity159 is not a natural - born left back and newcomer @entity160 may get his chance despite a lack of experience			1
that position has been a weak link in @entity116 ’s team for a long time			0
the two central defenders , @entity168 and @entity169 , have not often played alongside each other and when they have , were not always the bedrock of stability			0
when attacking midfielder @entity55 got injured in the match against @entity58 and had to drop out of the @entity26 , @entity116 decided to call up a defender in his place , @entity176			0
this could be another indication that @entity16 is moving into the midfield .			1

@entity17 players were taken on a sailing jolly ahead of the @entity183
@entity52 's squad were given motivational talk by explorer @entity5
@entity22 and @entity189 were taken out on jet skis
players including @entity35 and @entity83 enjoyed a beach walk
@entity55 has been ruled out for three months with an ankle injury
@entity28 could be sacrificed for @entity16 in midfield
