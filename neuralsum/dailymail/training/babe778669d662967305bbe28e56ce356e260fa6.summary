fearless : celebrity chef @entity1 has a spine of steel and the coolest of heads in a crisis @entity1 , celebrity chef , author and businesswoman , does n’t look like the sort of person you ’d immediately turn to for help if you found yourself in a tight corner			1
she is 51 , petite — a little over 5ft tall — fine - boned and glamorous , her blonde hair cascading in a tumble of luxuriant curls			1
she ’s a doll - like size six , wears a floral pinny and pads round her elegant £ 20 million town house in @entity22 in bare feet , her dainty toenails painted vermillion			1
she looks as if a gust of wind would blow her over			1
but appearances are deceptive : @entity1 has a spine of steel , the tenacity of a terrier and the coolest of heads in a crisis			1
last summer , she was robbed by a gang of muggers			1
they pounced after she parked her car in a quiet side street to go shopping , held her in an arm - lock and wrenched her £ 12,000 @entity43 watch from her wrist , then snatched her shopping bag from the boot of her car			1
while such an ordeal would have reduced most of us to quivering wrecks , @entity1 , a divorced mum - of - three , had the presence of mind to note the registration number of one of the gang ’s getaway mopeds			1
she handed it to the police at the crime scene			1
the thugs , who had by then terrorised and robbed a string of affluent victims in the wealthy @entity65 area of north @entity22 — including a 70 - year - old man who they hit with a hammer — were swiftly identified			1
within a couple of weeks they were arrested and charged			1
their violent three - month crime spree abruptly curtailed , the trio — @entity73 , 23 , @entity74 , 20 and @entity75 , 21 — were this week jailed for a total of 23 years			1
does @entity1 now live in fear ? ‘ you ca n’t ! ’ she exclaims			1
‘ otherwise , the muggers have won			1
they ’ve got away with it			2
i wo n’t become a prisoner in my own home because of them			2
‘ i wo n’t pretend i ’m not wary			2
i do n’t wear an expensive watch any more			2
and i make sure i ’ve got my house keys in my hand before i get out of my car as thieves often strike when people are standing on their own doorsteps			2
‘ i do n’t take unnecessary risks			2
and , actually , i feel rather lucky			2
they could have hit me with the hammer			2
’ but the fact is , @entity1 seems to be rather more unlucky than most : two years ago , she was forced to track down her beloved samoyed , @entity94 , when he was dognapped by a gang			1
she says : ‘ i plastered posters , offering a reward for his safe return , all over @entity22			2
so when a woman rang — she said she ’d seen my poster , and although she was cagey and vague , she said she might be able to help — i went off on my own to meet her			2
‘ i suppose it seems reckless , but i was prepared to take a risk to get him back			2
‘ she lived on a council estate in north @entity22			2
it was the sort of place you would n’t want to be alone in after dark , but i do n’t remember feeling trepidation			2
i just wanted my dog back			1
unlucky : two years ago , @entity1 was forced to track down her beloved samoyed , @entity94 , pictured , when he was dognapped by a gang			1
she found him filthy and almost unrecognisable at a flat in @entity22 ‘ i knocked on the door , went into the flat and there was @entity94 , filthy and almost unrecognisable			2
there was a split second ’s delay before he leapt into my arms			2
we ’d been apart for ten days and he was mad with joy			2
’ the woman who was harbouring @entity1 ’s beloved dog claimed , improbably , he had been ‘ dumped ’ on her doorstep			1
police , it later emerged , found she had links with an armed robber , a member of the gang they believed was responsible for snatching him , along with 11 other pedigrees , all ransomed for ‘ reward ’ money			1
there was insufficient evidence to charge them ; even so , @entity1 felt she had won a small victory			1
with the muggers , however , the evidence she provided was enough to convict them			1
it happened on june 30 last year when she was nearing home			2
‘ it was a warm day , 5pm and broad daylight , and i was n’t wearing anything ostentatious , ’ says @entity1			1
‘ i parked my mercedes in a side street to do some shopping — no one was around — and went to the boot to get a bag out			2
just then , three men on mopeds sped up out of nowhere			2
one had a hammer and their faces were obscured by helmets and scarves			2
there was no time to feel scared			0
one of them shouted : “ give us the watch , ” but i could n’t give it to them			0
they ’d pinioned me by my arms , wrenched the watch off , making my wrist bleed			0
‘ then they took my striped canvas bag from the boot			0
i told them it was empty , but i think they thought my purse was in it			0
‘ then i heard raised voices from people across the road : “ leave her alone ! ” for a second , the gang loitered and it was then that i took down the number plate			0
then they sped off and it was over			0
‘ all i felt was relief : that i was n’t hurt and all they ’d taken were things which were replaceable			0
’ thugs : @entity1 was robbed by muggers @entity73 ( left ) , 23 , @entity74 ( centre ) , 20 and @entity75 ( right ) , 21 - who were this week jailed for a total of 23 years - as she parked in a quiet side street the police , summoned by passers - by , arrived within five minutes			1
‘ they tracked the gang in a helicopter and just over an hour later came back to me with a photo of my canvas bag under the seat of one of the mopeds			0
i was amazed how quick they were			0
’ the bag and registration number @entity1 took were vital evidence that helped persuade the gang to plead guilty to 12 robberies at @entity213 this week			1
@entity1 , who chose not to attend court , feels their sentences — 11 years for ringleader @entity73 , eight for @entity75 and four for accomplice @entity74 — were just			1
she ’s been told one of the men has since expressed his repentance in a letter that will be sent to her soon			0
‘ i ’d like to read it , ’ she says			0
‘ i ’d even like to visit him in prison			0
i think i could tell then if his remorse was genuine			0
can he really be sorry if he ’s mugged 12 people ? i ’m curious to know			0
’ successful : @entity1 's business is worth £ 10million @entity1 ’s no - nonsense attitude has been shaped by her upbringing and by life ’s events			1
born in 1962 , she was raised by prosperous parents in @entity234 , central @entity22 , attending the prestigious @entity235			0
her father , @entity236 , owned a manufacturing business , making shoe soles			0
but the family ’s prosperity ended when the business failed			0
@entity1 ’s mother , @entity242 , an architect , assumed the role of bread - winner , instilling in her daughter the values of self - sufficiency and hard work			1
but her first career as a harpist — she trained at the @entity251 — ended after a terrible family tragedy			0
in 1985 , @entity1 married oil broker @entity253 and two years later a daughter , @entity255 , arrived			1
just 13 weeks later , she died of encephalitis			0
it is the defining tragedy of @entity1 ’s life and the reason she gives short shrift to muggers and dognappers			1
nothing could hurt her more than that loss			0
‘ @entity255 ’s hands were twitching involuntarily , ’ she remembers of that dreadful day the illness first took hold			0
‘ she was projectile vomiting			0
i called the doctor who was quite dismissive			0
i felt embarrassed that i was being an over-protective first - time mum			1
‘ but the next morning @entity255 was no better			0
i took her to hospital			0
i held her in my arms for four - and - a - half hours , and then she died			1
that is the most devastating loss a mother can bear			1
‘ i stopped playing the harp			0
i knew the only way to deal with the grief was to have another child			0
’ three more children followed — @entity284 , 26 , @entity283 , 25 and @entity285 , 22 — and @entity1 built a career round her family			1
she began to cook for her children and published a book of recipes to great acclaim			0
more books followed , and today her business is worth £ 10million			0
‘ cooking became my therapy , my route through grief , ’ she explains			0
‘ the books , the cooking ... they will be my legacy , because what you do for others lives on			0
what you do for yourself dies with you			0
’ eight years ago , she and @entity253 were divorced — they remain amicable — and now shares her home with her partner , @entity308 , a former film producer			0
@entity255 ’s death puts everything into perspective			0
when in june 2013 @entity1 sacked an employee , @entity314 ( then her sales director ) , his retaliation was vicious : he accused her of sexually harassing him			1
she spent £ 60,000 on legal fees , fighting to clear her name			0
last summer she was vindicated — on the morning the case was due in court , @entity314 , 39 , retracted his allegation			0
‘ i would n’t be bullied , ’ she says			0
‘ i stood up for what was right and i put up a good fight			0
’ no doubt , those three muggers now languishing in jail would wholeheartedly agree			1
after building her business from scratch at the kitchen table , @entity1 believes that having children does n't mean a full stop at the end of your cv			1
she is now helping equip other mums with the confidence and power to start - up their own businesses with her new book , @entity338			1
@entity338 , by @entity1 ( published by @entity339 ) , is out now			1

celebrity chef @entity1 , 51 , is petite , fine - boned and glamorous
but she has tenacity , a spine of steel , and the coolest of heads in a crisis
the brave mother - of - three *rescued* her beloved dog when he was stolen
and gave police evidence vital evidence after she was robbed by muggers
