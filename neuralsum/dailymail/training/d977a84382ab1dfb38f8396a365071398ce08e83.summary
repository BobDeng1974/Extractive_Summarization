and although he made a formal complaint to the airway when he landed at @entity40 and two follow up emails , mr @entity9 is yet to receive an apology			1
mr @entity9 says despite his agony he was ' brushed off ' by the airline crew , who merely gave him a damp cloth to dab his injuries with mr @entity9 , of @entity47 , @entity12 , said the accident happened as the stewardess leaned over him to nearer to his mother in a window seat			1
he said : ' i was in absolute agony			2
' as soon as it happened i pulled my shirt open and could see blisters popping up already			2
' the air stewardess was quite dismissive actually , she apologised once but none of them seemed very eager to make up for what had happened			0
' and on top of that , they did n't seem to be doing much to ease the pain i was in			2
they gave me a cloth and some water to dab at the burn , which helped initially but whenever i moved it , the pain started again			2
' they gave me some gel to put on the burn but that did n't really help			1
' i was pacing the floor of the aeroplane because i just could n't get any relief from the pain			2
' i have n't been able to work since it happened , i 'm on painkillers and it 's even painful wearing clothes - and i 'm still waiting for a formal apology			1
' mr @entity9 , married to 34 - year - old @entity83 , was travelling home from a trip visiting family in @entity87 with his mother @entity88 on april 2			1
' we 'd flown from @entity90 to @entity91 , and were on a seven - hour flight back from @entity91 when it happened , ' he explained			2
' we were about two hours into the seven hour flight home , when the air stewardess was giving my mother a cup of tea			0
' the passenger in front of me reclined their chair as she leaned over me to pass the cup to my mother , and knocked her - so she spilt the tea over me			1
' i jumped up with the pain , it was absolute agony			0
' i 'm so angry that they are trying to ignore what happened			0
i 've contacted my solicitor and they are looking into whether i have a case against the airline , ' said mr @entity9 ' the stewardess took me to the front area where they prepare the food and gave me a sachet of gel to put on the burn and some paracetamol			1
but that did n't stop the pain at all so she gave me a cloth and a bottle of mineral water to cool it down			0
but whenever i removed the cloth the pain started again			0
' about half an hour later the pain had n't stopped so they put out an announcement for any medically - trained people on board			1
' luckily there were two doctors - one was a gp and the other a surgeon			0
they said the burn looked bad and asked the steward if there was anything else they could give to me			0
' i 've been unable to work and ca n't dress properly because of the injures			1
the doctor told me it will take a while to heal , ' said the father - of - four ' at this point , a senior cabin crew member , who had n't been involved before now , gave me another sachet of cream			1
i do n't know what it was			0
it did n't really help the pain			0
' the captain then put out a call to @entity40 to tell them to have paramedics ready , so i had to suffer the rest of the flight in pain			0
' when we landed , they got all the passengers off before calling the paramedics on board			0
they put on some more gel and dressed the wound			0
' they asked if i wanted an ambulance to take me to hospital but i said i would go to my local hospital as i wanted to get my mother , who 's suffered three or four heart attacks in the last couple of years and was very upset about what had happened , home			0
' i went to see my gp who gave me flucloxacillin tablets for the pain and a cream to soothe the burns but i 've been unable to work and ca n't dress properly because of the injures			1
the doctor told me it will take a while to heal			0
' he added : ' while i was at the airport , a @entity11 representative took a statement from me and i said i wanted to make a formal complaint			0
' i 've since followed this up with two emails to the address she gave me , asking for a reply , but i 've had nothing			0
' i 'm so angry that they are trying to ignore what happened			0
i 've contacted my solicitor and they are looking into whether i have a case against the airline			2
' @entity11 denies mr @entity9 's account of events that it has acted negligently in any respect			1
lawyers acting for the airline said it would be inappropriate to comment further as mr @entity9 has instructed his solicitors in the matter .			1
