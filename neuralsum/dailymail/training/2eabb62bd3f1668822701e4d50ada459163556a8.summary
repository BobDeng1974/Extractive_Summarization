many of us were taught that @entity3 populations were almost wiped out by diseases such as tuberculosis , brought to the @entity6 by @entity8 explorers			1
but a new theory suggests the arrival of seals and sea lions could in fact be to blame			1
scientists believe the marine animals brought the disease to @entity17 where it spread - long before @entity18 arrived in 1492			1
scientists believe that seals and sea lions brought tuberculosis to @entity17 where it spread to people long before @entity18 arrived in 1492 while estimates vary , it is thought that 95 per cent of the 20 million people living in the @entity26 before the @entity8 arrived were killed by ‘ new ’ diseases carried by explorers			1
anthropological geneticists @entity30 of @entity31 and @entity32 of the @entity33 in @entity34 have studied pre-columbian @entity36 tuberculosis genomes			2
the team examined @entity39 from 1,000 - year - old skeletons found in @entity41 as well as other samples and compared them to a dataset of modern genomes			1
they found a clear relationship to @entity49 lineages in animals - especially seals and sea lions			1
@entity49 ( @entity49 ) is a bacterial infection spread through inhaling tiny droplets from the coughs or sneezes of an infected person			0
it is caused by a bacterium called mycobacterium tuberculosis			0
@entity49 mainly affects the lungs but can attack bones and the nervous system			0
symptoms include : a persistent cough for more than three weeks , weight loss , night sweats , a fever and tiredness			0
now - a - days it is treated with antibiotics			0
in the last 20 years @entity49 cases have gradually increased in the @entity71 - and elsewhere in the world			2
in 2011 , 8,963 cases of @entity49 were reported in the @entity71			0
of these , more than 6,000 of these cases affected people who were born outside the @entity71			0
it is estimated that one - third of the world 's population is infected with latent @entity49			2
of these , about 10 per cent will become active at some point			0
their study , published in the journal nature , describes ‘ unequivocal evidence ’ that @entity49 spread to @entity86 populations before any explorers arrived			2
‘ skeletal evidence of tuberculosis is present in the archaeological records in both the @entity94 and @entity6 , ’ said @entity88 , of the @entity90 's @entity89			0
‘ the source of tuberculosis in the @entity6 long has been a question for researchers			0
‘ this paper provides strong evidence that marine mammals may have been the likely culprits , bringing tuberculosis to @entity17 long before @entity8 arrived there			2
’ scientists think that once @entity8 tuberculosis strains arrived in the @entity26 , they completely replaced the strains brought over by seafaring animals			1
this confused diagnosis of the impacts on @entity86 populations as researchers struggled to identify which tuberculosis strain was involved in @entity86 deaths			0
‘ we are not sure what the timeframe was for the replacement of @entity120 strains by @entity8 strains after contact , ’ said dr @entity114			2
‘ it is likely that the new @entity8 strain , which is more virulent , was a culprit - particularly since tuberculosis is really good at spreading during times of social crowding and distress			1
’ scientists think that once @entity8 tuberculosis strains arrived in the @entity26 - carried by explorers such as @entity18 ( illustrated ) , they completely replaced the strains brought over by seafaring animals @entity133 has the largest variety of @entity49 strains , suggesting the pathogen likely originated there and spread			1
this study supports the theory that humans gave the disease to animals and within the last 2,500 years , marine animals carried the disease from @entity133 to @entity17 where they gave it back to humans			0
dr @entity146 said : ‘ the connection to seals and sea lions is important to explain how a mammalian - adapted pathogen that evolved in @entity133 around 6,000 years ago could have reached @entity41 5,000 years later			1
’ it is hoped that the study could help to understand the recent emergence of the disease .			1

geneticists from @entity120 and @entity34 analysed 1,000 - year - old skeletons in @entity41
they found tuberculosis *dna* , with a relationship to @entity49 lineages in seals
scientists think that seals and sea lions carried the disease to the @entity26 before @entity18 arrived in 1492
but new @entity8 strain of @entity49 contributed to deaths of native americans
it 's hoped the study could help understand the emergence of the disease
