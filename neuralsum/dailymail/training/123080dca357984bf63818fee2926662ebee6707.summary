only four companies have signed on to base their operations in the @entity2 as the majority of the world 's most expensive office building remains available for rent			0
magazine publishing company @entity7 are the largest tenants , having claimed 24 floors starting on the 20th floor			1
the @entity11 , a company that provides office space for @entity14 businesses , has signed on for floors 64 through 69			1
a hospitality management company , @entity16 , has purchased 100,000 square feet on the 100th , 101st , and 102nd floors which includes the observation deck			1
@entity19 reports that the final interested party is the @entity21 , a federal agency , who has claimed six floors starting on the 50th floor as their new base of operations			0
this week 's earlier report that the owners have slashed office rents nearly 10 per cent comes as little surprise then			0
the @entity38 reported that rents have been cut to $ 69 a square foot for larger tenants on the building 's middle floors			1
developer @entity44 says that is down from $ 75 a square foot			2
' the market 's not there , ' mr @entity44 told @entity38			0
he bought a stake in the 1,776 - foot tower from the @entity51 and @entity52 in 2011			2
' when we started in 2011 , everybody expected the economy to take off , and obviously that has n't happened			0
' all told , the construction of the 1,776 - foot building cost $ 3.9billion major tenants in the building include magazine publisher @entity7 and the government 's @entity21			1
the skyscraper , the nation 's tallest building , is scheduled to open later this year			0
filling the floors : the developer has cut the asking rent for the middle floors of the @entity2 from $ 75 - per - foot to $ 69 - per - foot competition : rent in some of the middle floors of the @entity2 have been knocked to $ 69 - per - foot but neighboring buildings cost closer to $ 53 - per - foot so that makes it tough for businesses to swallow ' we have a lot of people looking at the space , but because of the asking rent , we are not able to really put anything over the finish line , ' mr @entity44 told @entity82			1
part of the problem is that while there is a great deal of interest in real estate downtown - with @entity89 and the @entity90 among the list of companies looking to move their operations south - the neighboring buildings are able to charge far cheaper rental rates			2
for instance , average downtown office rents were $ 53.87 in the first three months of this year , making the 1 @entity2 rates more difficult to accept .			0

less than half of the office space in the building is rented out
@entity7 is the largest tenant having claimed 24 floors
the @entity21 , a @entity14 *communal* office space and a hospitality management company are the other tenants
developer is having trouble signing on new occupants because neighboring buildings are cheaper
price - per - foot of the middle floors of the building have now been reduced from $ 75 to $ 69 but nearby buildings are closer to $ 53
construction of the new tower cost $ 3.9billion
