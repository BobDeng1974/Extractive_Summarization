@entity6 , 35 , surprised her husband of four years , @entity9 , by shedding almost three stone in two months while he was away on tour @entity9 compared his wife 's look to tv character @entity1 ( right ) before her weight loss ( left ) @entity6 said she was determined to beat the bulge before @entity9 - a corporal in the @entity28 - returned home and lose the weight with hypnosis			1
she said she was so committed to keeping her changing figure under wraps she would even make sure @entity9 could n't see her when the pair would video chat while @entity35 was serving abroad with the army			1
she said : ' i decided after @entity38 that i needed to do something - it was getting ridiculous			2
the weight just seemed to creep up on me and i could n't believe that i was a size 20			2
' i wanted to keep the whole surprise factor and do a big reveal so i would make sure @entity35 could n't see me when we skyped			1
' i was just googling weight loss and @entity45 came up - i had heard of people doing hypnosis to stop smoking so i thought i would give it a go			2
' i started at the beginning of january and the weight just seemed to drop off - i 've lost 38 pounds in just two months			1
' i even went out and bought a new dress , in a size 12 , and got dressed up for the occasion			1
' and when @entity35 walked through the door and saw me there was this look of shock on his face			0
' @entity9 , 42 , said : ' it was a massive shock - i felt like i had left behind @entity1 and came home to @entity3			1
before the weight loss : @entity6 had started to pile on the pounds after she became seriously ill with polycystic ovaries and comfort - ate to get over having to undergo a full hysterectomy ' nothing @entity6 has tried before has ever really worked so i was shocked that this worked so well			1
and it was lovely to see her in a dress for a change			0
' i have had to learn to feed myself too as she only eats when she 's hungry - so it has probably done me some good too			2
' when i get back from tour i have promised her i am going to take her shopping and treat her to some new clothes for our holiday			2
' the @entity77 can now fit her whole body in one leg of her former size 22 trousers @entity6 started to pile on the pounds after she became seriously ill with polycystic ovaries and comfort ate to get over having to undergo a full hysterectomy			1
but the determined @entity85 has now set herself the task of shedding the final two stone by the time @entity35 's tour comes to an end in 10 weeks time			0
and she is spurred on by a luxury holiday the pair have booked to the @entity93 - with her final goal being to flaunt her new bikini body in a size 12 tankini			1
the ultimate goal is for @entity6 to wear a size 12 tankini on the beach on holiday in the @entity93 @entity6 said : ' we always book a holiday for when @entity9 is off so that we have something to look forward to			1
' my goal now is to be able to wear a tankini on the beach - that 's what i am pushing towards			0
and i do n't want all the women looking at him while we are away			0
' i feel such a huge difference in myself since i started @entity45 and it is just so easy			0
it 's not a diet and i can still eat whatever i want , whenever i want - but i just eat when i 'm hungry			0
' it 's a way of life and i ca n't ever see myself going back to how i was before now			0
i have learned how to listen to my body , and only eat when i am hungry			0
