claim : murder suspect @entity0 says that @entity1 killed himself by mistake one of the men accused of killing @entity1 claimed today that the @entity6 spy 's death may have been an ' accidental suicide ' after he inadvertently handled polonium			1
@entity0 , who is wanted for the dissident 's murder , insisted that he was not involved in mr @entity1 's death and suggested that he had poisoned himself without knowing it			1
the suspect , a former @entity14 agent , has agreed to give evidence at the inquiry into @entity1 's death as long as he is given the right to examine secret evidence put forward by the police			1
if @entity20 testifies , he will have to do so by video link , because he will be arrested on suspicion of murder if he tries to travel to @entity23			0
mr @entity1 met with @entity0 and @entity24 , another former spy , in @entity25 shortly before he fell ill with radiation poisoning in november 2006 and died at the age of 43			2
at a press conference in @entity6 today , @entity0 asserted his innocence and blamed mr @entity1 for his own death - saying he was carrying around polonium rather than being given it by @entity20 and @entity24 , as has been previously claimed			1
he described the death as an ' accidental suicide ' , adding : ' i am more than sure that he was dealing with polonium without knowing it			1
' maybe there was some kind of polonium leak and it was gradually accumulating in his body			0
' i do n't know if he had it with him or if somebody gave him something that he carried with him			0
where he got the polonium from , that is the question			0
but @entity0 said this was impossible , adding : ' @entity1 told me that he would not eat anything because the night before he got terrible poisoning , was throwing up all night , and called an ambulance			2
' that proves our total innocence , that he had already come into contact with polonium , perhaps several days before our meeting			0
' he insisted that the reason he and @entity24 left a trail of polonium around @entity25 during their visit to the city was because they had been contaminated by their meeting with mr @entity1			2
@entity81 is exceptionally rare , and experts have previously said that the amount ingested by the victim could only have been produced in a government - run facility			0
suspects : @entity20 , left , and @entity24 , right , have previously refused to co-operate with the public inquiry into @entity1 's death meeting : @entity1 fell ill after going to see @entity20 and @entity24 at the @entity60 in @entity25 , pictured the two suspects had refused to co-operate with the public inquiry currently under way into mr @entity1 's death , saying that it would be biased against them			1
but last month , @entity20 dramatically changed his mind , and said that he would give evidence only if he is given ' core participant ' status			1
at today 's press conference , he told reporters : ' if i do n't get this status , i will not participate			1
' chairman sir @entity101 has issued @entity20 with a list of conditions which he must fulfil in order to be given the status , including issuing a full witness statement and disclosing all relevant documents			0
however , even if he is allowed to become a core participant he will not be given access to restricted material			0
family : @entity1 's son @entity111 and wife @entity112 outside the inquiry at the @entity114 the inquiry has set aside three days in late july for @entity20 to give evidence over video link			1
mr @entity1 accused @entity6 president @entity118 of being responsible for his killing in a statement issued from his deathbed			0
the spy fled @entity6 and sought refuge in @entity23 in 2000 , after he spoke against @entity118 , who he claimed had ordered him to kill tycoon @entity125			0
the inquiry was shown video footage of @entity6 special forces using a photograph of mr @entity1 as target practice , as well as a picture of him looking gaunt and weak hours before he died .			2

@entity0 claims @entity1 was carrying around polonium without knowing it
says the ex-spy 's death was ' accidental suicide ' during press conference
