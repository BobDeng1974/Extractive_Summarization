compare and contrast these two manager quotes about @entity1 from this season			2
the uncompromising @entity3 , asked in november whether he still thought it was a good idea to sell the in - form @entity1 to @entity5 on deadline day , said : ' i do n't have to prove that [ i was right ]			1
' why do i have to prove that ? i have already said what i think - he was not a line - up player , he was more a substitute than a line - up player			0
@entity1 trains ahead of his return to @entity15 with @entity5 in the @entity17 sixth round the @entity19 striker has been reduced to a bit - part role in recent weeks , spending time on the bench @entity3 wrote @entity1 off as not good enough for the @entity15 first team ' he was already , with different coaches , not a line - up player , but then with mr @entity26 , the world is changing ? no the world is not changing			1
they are not my facts , they are the facts of @entity1			0
' and @entity35 , speaking on the impact of @entity1 just the other day : ' he 's very important and has played many , many games since the start of the season			1
' i think he 's played in nearly every single game			0
his position is one of the three up front , central , left or right			0
' so @entity1 has apparently gone from a condemned man at @entity15 , destined to rot away on the bench , to a versatile and indispensable part of @entity5 's team			1
but , as the @entity19 striker returns to @entity49 for the first time for monday night 's crunch @entity17 sixth - round tie , has he actually fared that well at the @entity53 ? @entity1 celebrates a goal for @entity15 against @entity55 under @entity56 last season @entity1 was given a chance to impress on @entity15 's pre-season tour of the @entity60 well , at the time of @entity26 's outburst , just ahead of @entity15 's away match with @entity5 on november 22 , he had every reason to be tetchy			1
while @entity15 had endured their worst start to a season in living memory , @entity1 had made light of his £ 16m transfer fee			1
given regular football by @entity35 at the head of @entity5 's attack , he looked revitalised , a player brimming with confidence who looked on course to score 20 goals this season for his new team			1
just days after his move , @entity1 scored two for @entity19 in their 2 - 0 @entity82 qualifying win in @entity83 , before he opened his @entity84 account in a 3 - 0 win at @entity86			1
the highlight was a hat - trick in @entity5 's 4 - 1 @entity90 win over @entity91 , a performance praised by @entity35 as ' electric '			2
@entity35 was thrilled with @entity1 's early performances in an @entity5 shirt @entity1 's best performance in an @entity5 shirt was a hat - trick against @entity91 in the @entity90 @entity1 pictured here completing his treble against the @entity100 side at the @entity53 back in october @entity15 2008 - 09 13 appearances , 3 goals 2009 - 2010 11 appearances , 2 goals 2011 - 12 39 appearances , 12 goals 2012 - 13 40 appearances , 2 goals 2013 - 14 36 appearances , 10 goals 2014 - 15 3 appearances , 0 goals @entity5 2014 - 15 20 appearances , 7 goals at that point , it was all looking very awkward for @entity26			1
events since then have made him feel a little better , if not entirely vindicated			0
@entity1 has scored just three more goals for @entity5 since the @entity91 match			2
there have been mitigating circumstances though			0
@entity1 suffered a thigh injury and missed the whole of january , his absence coinciding with a return to form for @entity127			1
by the time @entity1 had rediscovered his fitness , @entity35 found it very difficult to take the @entity130 out of the forward position			2
so @entity1 's versatility has become something of a curse			2
when he plays , he is stuck out on the wing , a position he is less effective in			0
when he left for north @entity137 , he said : ' i prefer to play through the middle			0
once i get into the box and am getting the chances , i have got faith in my ability			0
' and , at this pivotal stage of the season , his game time has dried up as well			0
@entity5 are prospering without him			0
@entity1 's £ 16m move to @entity5 led to a resurgence in form for @entity19 too @entity1 's last goal for the @entity84 came in the win over @entity55 just after @entity153 @entity1 was left on the bench during the win over @entity156 and he was brought on for mere cameos in the wins over @entity159 and @entity160			1
so the 24 - year - old returns to @entity49 with plenty to prove			2
he believed @entity5 was a club that would advance his career but evidence of this has so far been in short supply			0
however , earning @entity90 qualification and winning the @entity17 for @entity5 - the two things @entity26 craves so dearly this season - would certainly make him feel better .			1

@entity1 returns to @entity49 for @entity17 sixth - round tie
@entity172 left @entity15 on deadline day in £ 16m deal
@entity3 said he was not good enough for the @entity15 first team
the @entity19 forward started his career at the @entity53 positively
but he has *struggled* with form and injury in recent months
@entity127 's *purple* patch has left @entity1 stuck out on the wing
