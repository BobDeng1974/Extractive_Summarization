ruling : immigration judge @entity0 , pictured , said @entity1 can stay in @entity2 a @entity4 asylum seeker who raped a 12 - year - old girl has been allowed to remain in @entity2 – after a judge ruled it would breach his human rights to deport him			1
@entity1 was jailed for raping the girl just months after he was given refugee status			0
when he was sentenced , another judge described him as ‘ a potential danger to young girls ’ and put him on the @entity14 for the rest of his life			1
but after serving a three - year sentence , an immigration tribunal ruled @entity1 could stay in @entity2 on the grounds that he could be in danger if he returned to @entity4			1
senior immigration judge @entity0 allowed the 28 - year - old to remain in @entity2 , even though the rapist ’s probation officers found that he presented some risk to young people			1
in his ruling , judge @entity0 said : ‘ we find that the appellant is still entitled to the protection of the @entity30 and the @entity31			1
' in any event , removing him would be contrary to the @entity2 ’s obligations under the @entity34			0
’ it is not the first time that judge @entity0 has made a controversial decision			1
last month , @entity38 reported how he allowed an @entity39 , who claimed he killed people while fighting for the @entity42 , to remain in @entity2			0
it has also been reported that judge @entity0 has often allowed foreign criminals to remain in @entity2 because of their ‘ right to a family life ’ under the @entity46			1
his latest decision is another setback for home secretary @entity49 , whose plans to crack down on the way foreign criminals use human rights to avoid being deported appear to be repeatedly undermined by the courts			1
@entity54 , conservative mp for @entity55 , who has tabled a @entity56 to replace the @entity46 with a @entity2 @entity56 , said : ‘ @entity2 will always be there to provide refuge to those in need			0
but people who commit crimes here should be sent back immediately			0
‘ right - thinking people in @entity2 will be appalled that this person will be allowed to stay here			0
it sums up what is wrong with the @entity68 human rights laws			1
‘ we should have zero tolerance of refugees who commit crimes			0
cases like this are why i have tabled a @entity2 @entity56 so we can control our borders and ensure that foreign criminals and terrorists are deported immediately			0
’ @entity1 had attacked the 12 - year - old girl while he was staying with her family during a five - day trip to @entity81 threat : judge @entity0 allowed an @entity39 , who claimed he killed people while fighting for the @entity42 , similar to those pictured , to remain in @entity2 @entity1 , who is from the @entity87 region , arrived in @entity2 in october 2003 and was awarded refugee status in february 2005			1
but two months later he was arrested at his address in @entity90 over the rape of a 12 - year - old @entity93 girl			1
@entity1 had attacked her while staying with her family during a five - day trip to @entity81			2
the victim ’s family had offered to put him up while he visited his friend , @entity98 , then 22 , also from @entity87			0
@entity1 and @entity98 knew each other and the girl ’s family from refugee camps in @entity103 and @entity104			0
@entity1 , who pleaded guilty to one count of child rape , was sentenced to three years ’ imprisonment at @entity108			2
@entity98 was convicted of three counts of child rape and jailed for ten years			0
@entity111 , pictured , said he regarded @entity1 as a ' potential danger to young girls ' when sentencing him for the rape of a 12 - year - old judge @entity115 , said : ‘ i regard each of you as a potential danger to young girls and so each of you will be banned for the rest of your life from ever taking up a job which involves working with children under 16			1
’ when @entity1 was released from @entity127 jail in 2008 , the @entity125 ordered that he return to @entity4 and he was locked up in an immigration removal centre			2
@entity1 appealed to the immigration court and when a judge rejected his bid , he mounted a fresh appeal to the @entity133 and @entity134			2
at the @entity81 hearing , judge @entity0 ruled that removing @entity1 , who comes from the @entity137 tribe , would breach his rights under @entity139 of the @entity34 , which prohibits torture or inhumane punishment			1
judge @entity0 referred to a 2009 ruling which stated that @entity144 tribes such as the @entity137 are ‘ at risk of persecution in @entity87 and can not reasonably be expected to relocate elsewhere in @entity4 ’			1
the judge also said @entity1 could not be deported because he was not a danger to the public , and therefore could not have his refugee status taken away from him			2
he said that even though his probation officers found he ‘ presented some risk to young people ’ , @entity1 had ‘ faced up to his responsibilities and indicated an intention to behave himself in the future ’			2
it is believed @entity1 was allowed to leave the immigration removal centre around 2009 and then moved to @entity159 , and still lives in the @entity160			2
it is not known if he received legal aid to fund his immigration fight			0
last night the government admitted it was powerless in the face of the tribunal ’s decision , with an aide to mrs may stressing there was nothing the home secretary could do			0
‘ we are at the mercy of the courts , ’ they said			0
the @entity176 said : ‘ we do not believe this individual needs or deserves refuge in this country			0

@entity1 was described as a ' potential danger to young girls ' by the judge who sentenced him for the *sex* attack on the child
senior immigration judge @entity0 said it would breach the 28 - year - old *'s* human rights to deport @entity1
ministers *insist* they are powerless to act
