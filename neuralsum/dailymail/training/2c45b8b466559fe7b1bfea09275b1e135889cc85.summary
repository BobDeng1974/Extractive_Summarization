but this overgrown telephone box is still fully functional			1
the only red @entity6 phone box in the village of @entity8 , near @entity9 in @entity10 has been almost completely covered by ivy for six months			1
hidden : just three phone calls have been made in this telephone box in the last year just three calls have been made in the phone box in the last year with the last one made in june			1
a spokesman for @entity6 said : ‘ it is a box that is still in use and three calls were made from it in the last year , with the last one in june			2
‘ we have n’t had any complaints about the box from members of the public but we have seen a picture of the foliage and we will be sending an engineer to check the kiosk			0
‘ @entity29 seems to have crept over from the neighbouring garden			0
’ when disgruntled residents found they could n't even open the door , they decided to take matters into their own hands and cut back the ivy			0
the unkempt phone box is perhaps a sign of the times when more people are using mobile phones than ever before			1
facelift : disgruntled residents cut back the ivy after they could n't even open the door by march this year , @entity45 said 92 per cent of the @entity47 ’s adult population had a mobile phone - more than 46million people			1
the iconic telephone boxes were once a familiar sight on the streets of the @entity47 , painted red to make them easily identifiable to the public			2
despite a reduction in their numbers in recent years , red boxes can still be seen in many places and in current or former @entity47 colonies around the world			0
some kiosks have been adopted by villages and used as mini libraries , information centres , art galleries and even a one - night only pub.			0
