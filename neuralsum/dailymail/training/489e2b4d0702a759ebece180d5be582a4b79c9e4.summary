by @entity0 as the @entity2 kicks off in @entity3 today , the wags are cramming their @entity4 into their @entity6 suitcases to fly out and join their other halves			2
coach @entity8 has told his boys their wives are n't officially authorised to be there and has banned them from travelling with the team			2
but luckily for us - and @entity3 's retail economy - the likes of @entity16 and @entity17 , whose husbands @entity18 and @entity20 are key players , may well be setting up camp in @entity3 anyway			1
@entity23 caught up with the two glamorous footballers ' wives to find out their summer style , beauty and fitness tips			2
chief @entity1 : @entity16 , who is married to @entity30 player @entity18 , is preparing to jet off to @entity3 to support her husband in the @entity2 and has shared her summer beauty tips with @entity23 leading the pack is the @entity1 who needs no introduction ; @entity18 's wife @entity16 , who is packing her bags ahead of the tournament			1
the 28 - year - old mother - of - two told @entity40 : ' i 'm so excited to go as i 've never been before and i 'm always really curious to discover new places			2
i 'm sure when we find our feet there , we will have a great time			2
' while @entity16 may have become notorious for her penchant for designer handbags and high - end clothes , the mother of two reveals that she 's going to be embracing a more casual style in @entity3			1
' i do n't think many of the football fans will be dressing up so i am going for the casual look , nothing too dressy			0
i am loving tailored shorts at the moment , which i 'll team with wedges and some fashionable jewellery			2
new campaign : @entity16 is currently fronting the new @entity61 campaign , a new perfume - scented range of washing detergents , and says the ultra-feminine campaign reflects her personal style ' i also love crop tops but because i do n't like showing my belly , i will wear them with high - waisted shorts			1
' the @entity70 designer says her favourite high - street store is @entity72 , because it takes trends straight from the catwalk , while her favourite designer label is @entity76 because the clothes help ' show off her figure well ' and cinch in at the waist , her least favourite body part			1
sharing her top tips for looking glam poolside , something @entity16 knows all about , she said : ' my top tip is getting a well - fitting bikini			1
lots of people get it wrong and when i designed my range for @entity70 , i really focused on creating a fit for every body type			0
' @entity16 , who cites her style icon as ' gorgeous ' @entity93 , will also be cramming lots of kaftans , kimonos and maxi dresses into her suitcase for @entity3			1
as for her @entity3 beauty regime , @entity16 says she will be keeping it natural			1
' i barely wear any make - up on holiday and just pop on some blush when i head out , ' she said			1
the @entity1 who needs no introduction : @entity16 , 28 , who is married to @entity18 has announced that she - and no doubt her many @entity6 suitcases - will be making the trip to @entity3 she has n't been working out too much ahead of her trip ( ' i 'm not doing more than usual , ' she said ) , and has scheduled in some pilates sessions in the week running up to her flight			1
professional as always , @entity16 has been cramming in her work duties ahead of the trip			1
yesterday , she helped launch the new @entity61 range , a range of fabric conditioner blended by perfume experts			0
as someone with a passion for fashion , this was a campaign close to @entity16 's heart			1
' when they approached me to work with them , i thought it was a fantastic idea			2
obviously having kids , i do so much washing so i want it to smell nice and this is the first product out there like this			0
' like all women , i ’m obsessed with perfume and it ’s the reason i ’m passionate about @entity61			0
there ’s nothing better than coming home to the smell of fragrant laundry , so i think it ’s a perfect idea combining fine fragrance with a softening product			0
blonde bombshell : another @entity1 who may well be flying out to support husband and @entity30 captain @entity20 is @entity17 ' i still remember the smell of my mum ’s laundry and it ’s really important for me to create that comforting and memorable experience for my own family			1
' i just thought " why has n't anyone done this before ? " the campaign was girly and floral and reflects my style			0
' other than working with @entity61 , @entity16 has been busy designing her @entity155 range for @entity70 , which she says is ' coming on well , ' and is planning a summer holiday for after the @entity2 so the family can relax together			1
another @entity1 who may well be flying out to support husband and @entity30 captain @entity20 is @entity17			1
@entity17 told us : ' i 'm really not sure if i 'm going yet so i have n't even thought about what i would take			1
' the mother - of - two did , however , reveal that @entity20 's healthy lifestyle ahead of the @entity2 has been having a positive effect on hers			1
she said : ' i eat pretty healthily most of the time			0
obviously @entity20 ’s diet is really healthy so that encourages me to eat well			1
' maybe if i 'm going away i would be extra good the week before and try not to snack in between meals or eat carbs after 6pm			0
i train three times a week with my trainer @entity173 and we do a mixture or cardio and weights and core strength			0
we mix it up so i do n't get bored and sometimes if i am being really good i may go for a run as well during the week			0
' while she and @entity20 share a healthy lifestyle , the model and columnist says they 'd never share her beauty products			1
' he knows i love my products so he would n’t dare touch them ! , ' she laughed			0
@entity17 is a huge product junkie but while she may be able to afford the most luxurious lotions and potions on the market , the @entity1 loves a good budget buy			1
' i have lots of budget beauty secrets			0
i love @entity196 and go because it 's a lovely body moisturiser if you ’re in a hurry and it absorbs really quickly and smells lovely and fresh			0
it 's great for taking away on holiday			2
fighting fit : the mother - of - two said that husband @entity20 's healthy lifestyle ahead of the @entity2 has been having a positive effect on hers ' my favourite budget beauty gadget is the @entity208			1
i use it to keep my feet nice and smooth			0
it ’s handy in the summer as i can give myself a quick pedi before i head out in my flip flops or sandals			0
' i also love @entity215 dry shampoo			0
it 's great for freshening up between washes and also if my hair ’s feeling a bit flat it 's great for adding some volume			0
' also , little @entity224 tubs are great			0
i put it on my eyelashes to make them grow and to keep them moisturised			0
i also use it as a quick cheap lip gloss			0
i always have a little tub in my bag , ' she said			0
citing her ultimate beauty icon as @entity235 , who she describes as ' amazing ' , @entity17 says she ' is n't one to have loads of beauty treatments '			1
beauty buff : @entity17 opened up beauty bag for @entity23 and most of it is budget			2
the @entity1 also revealed that she 'd love to work in health and fitness she said : ' i 'm not one to have loads of treatments to be honest but probably a spray tan or a hydro facial			1
i have them every couple of months if i can			0
it 's like a really nice deep clean for your face			0
your skin feels so clean and soft afterwards			2
' aside from supporting her husband , @entity17 has a @entity2 column and a fitness blog with @entity261 , which she says she ' loves ' doing			1
