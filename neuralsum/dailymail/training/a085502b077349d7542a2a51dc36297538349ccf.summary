mr @entity8 , who works in an abattoir , began to cut open the stomach of the wombat while mr @entity7 filmed the extraordinary procedure			1
the footage shows the outer layer of fur and skin being cut away by mr @entity8 , who uses a series of clean cuts to carefully open the wombat until they can see the joey inside			1
after piercing the pouch , the baby wombat slides out onto the dirt and rolls around before being helped to its feet by mr @entity8			1

ms @entity74 said that baby wombats generally weigh about three kilograms when they are birthed from the pouch , and so the little creature will need to put on a significant amount of weight before it can be released into the wild			0

' @entity112 are battlers but you have to treat them with love			0
he 's so tiny , he 's the size of a pork sausage			0
' ms @entity74 is a representative for @entity101 , which has animal carers all around the state			2
' if anyone comes across a baby wombat or kangaroo that has been stunned or injured they can call a fauna rescue service			2

' the boys did n't know what they were doing but they did a good job			0
fauna in @entity10 are so neglected so it 's nice seeing people looking after animals , ' she said			0
