by @entity0 published : 08:06 est , 13 april 2013 updated : 08:21 est , 13 april 2013 death rates at a children 's heart unit in @entity5 did not hit the threshold to trigger an @entity8 safety alert , it has been revealed			1
but two other centres , @entity10 in @entity11 and @entity12 in central @entity13 , also came close to the limit , according to the figures , which cover the years 2009 to 2012			1
surgery at @entity18 's child cardiac unit was halted at the end of last month after @entity20 said it had ' serious concerns ' that data showed the unit had a death rate double that of other centres			1
it resumed again on wednesday			2
mortality rates for all children 's heart surgery centres in @entity20 have been released following the temporary suspension of operations in @entity5 @entity10 in @entity11 also came close to the threshold that would trigger an @entity8 safety alert @entity20 medical director sir @entity34 has said he could not ' sit on ' data about high death rates without doing something about it and insisted the closure was not a ' knee - jerk reaction '			1
data released by @entity20 shows that none of the country 's ten centres breached thresholds for child heart surgery deaths , but @entity18 came ' very close ' to the alert threshold			1
the analysis was compiled by the @entity49 , based at @entity50 , which oversees @entity8 mortality data			0
analysis accompanying the figures said : ' these findings do not indicate a " safety " problem in any centre			0
' however , centres with three - year outcomes approaching the alert threshold may deserve additional scrutiny and monitoring of current performance			0
' by definition , around half of all units will have more deaths than " expected "			0
' it is therefore inappropriate to label centres as " blameworthy " for these deaths , as the analysis does not show a significantly increased mortality rate			2
' professor @entity72 said he would not allow his daughter to be operated on in @entity5 a spokesman for @entity10 said : ' we are pleased to learn that all children 's heart units in @entity20 , including @entity10 , are safe			1
' @entity10 undertakes rigorous scrutiny of all our outcomes for this service , including an independent review of any deaths that sadly occur , in order to ensure that we have the safest , highest quality service for some of the most vulnerable infants and children in the country			1
' yesterday , a senior @entity89 declared he would not want his daughter treated at the crisis - hit child heart unit in @entity5			1
professor sir @entity72 spoke out only days after the centre reopened after it was shut at short notice because of data he leaked on its comparative death rates			0
sir @entity72 , who now oversees @entity8 death rate data but was national director for heart disease until 2011 , told @entity101 that care at @entity5 was ‘ on the edge of acceptability ’			1
the father of a ten - year - old daughter , @entity107 , and three grown - up sons , he said : ‘ i tell you that i have a young daughter , i would go somewhere else			0
i would go to @entity111			0
’ his comments will alarm parents and enrage supporters of the unit at @entity18			0
they want him to be sacked , accusing him of ‘ conducting a cynical vendetta ’			0
paediatric heart surgery at @entity5 was suspended at the end of last month after data leaked by sir @entity72 appeared to show death rates running at twice the national average			1
surgeons at other units also raised concerns and parents told of children who were lucky to be alive			2
but others claimed the closure was politically motivated as it came just 24 hours after the @entity129 quashed plans to close the centre as part of measures to streamline children ’s heart services			2
sir @entity34 said he now ' disagreed ' with sir @entity72			0
‘ having reviewed the unit , having reviewed the data , the performance in @entity5 is in keeping with good national standards and i would be very happy to have my child operated upon in @entity5			2

@entity5 , @entity10 in @entity11 and @entity143 in @entity13 came close to limit
children 's cardiac surgery at @entity5 resumed this week after halt last month
@entity20 said it had ' serious concerns ' about death rate at @entity5
