i always thought international football was about the best players from one country pitting themselves against the best players from another country			2
but this is a fantastical idealistic notion			0
the cosmopolitan nature of the world in general , and the easy , frequent movement of large numbers of people from country to country in modern times has made the globe a smaller place			0
at the weekend , @entity19 's equaliser against @entity20 was scored by a @entity22 , @entity21 , who first arrived in @entity19 when he was 16			1
he has admitted he does n't know the words to the @entity25 national anthem			2
an @entity27 - born striker , @entity26 , is also in @entity29 's squad			1
@entity21 , who was born in @entity22 , celebrates his goal for @entity19 in their @entity32 qualifier with @entity20 @entity21 , who moved to @entity19 when he was 16 , has admitted that he does n't know the national anthem @entity27 - born @entity26 is also part of @entity29 's @entity19 squad @entity19 's @entity25 strikers are either too old ( @entity38 , @entity39 ) or out of form ( @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 ) , hence the foreign call - ups			1
the controversy led to @entity46 saying that ' the @entity25 national team should be @entity25			0
an @entity25 player deserves to play for the national team , while someone who was n't born in @entity19 , even if they have relatives , i do n't think they deserve to			1
' it 's nothing new for @entity19 : they won the @entity55 in 2006 with @entity57 @entity56 in the side			2
he moved to @entity19 at the ripe old age of 23 , did n't sing the national anthem , spoke in @entity62 after the game when he dedicated the victory in the final in @entity66 to the people back in his neighbourhood on the outskirts of @entity70 – roughly 7,000 miles from @entity71			1
as if more confusion was needed , he now manages in @entity73 and his middle name is @entity75			0
@entity19 won the @entity55 in 2006 with the @entity57 @entity56 in their squad @entity46 , the former @entity77 manager , said the @entity25 national team should be @entity25 only @entity19 's casual approach to ' @entity79 ' when it comes to football stretches back nearly 100 years : midfielder @entity82 played in a @entity55 final for @entity27 in 1930 , and then won the 1934 tournament with @entity19			1
@entity19 of course are not the only ones			2
@entity87 called up @entity22 @entity88 , and @entity89 have done it too : @entity91 was born in @entity92 , but there is a difference			1
@entity91 moved to @entity89 aged five			2
and this is an important point : @entity46 is wrong to believe you have to be born in the country for which you play : there are circumstances which may lead to you being born in one country , but brought up in another			2
the truth is that @entity91 is proud of his @entity92 roots , but feels @entity89			1
' @entity104 ' sang @entity105 , summing up the complexity of identity in four words			0
@entity88 is another high - profile player who was born somewhere other than the country he plays for @entity91 was born in @entity92 but has lived in @entity89 since the age of five there are plenty of @entity89 - born players who feel @entity114 because of their family history – a father from @entity117 perhaps			1
would it be wrong to deny them the chance to play for @entity121 ? i think so			0
back to @entity56 , who even after winning the @entity55 for @entity19 , said he felt @entity57			0
@entity19 and @entity87 are stretching credibility with their foreign internationals			2
and perhaps the worst of all is @entity127 selecting @entity128			0
the @entity130 star admitted he had not even been to @entity131 before his call - up and debut last week			1
he belted out the national anthem like he was one of the @entity135			0
no rules were broken because his dad was born in @entity138 , but how @entity139 can @entity128 feel if at the age of 25 he had failed to make the effort to even visit the country of his father 's birth ? good luck to him , but the whole mess raises questions about the nature and future of international football			1
@entity128 of @entity130 had never been to @entity131 before making his debut for them last week @entity128 's father was born in @entity138 , making him eligible to play for @entity131 when one country faces another country on a football pitch , should n't the main purpose of that match be to see how 11 players from one nation fares against 11 players from a different nation ? is n't that a fundamental premise and prerequisite of international football ? if it is n't , and the international game has become a free for all involving bending the rules so that it no longer matters where you were born and which nationality makes your heart beat stronger , then what is the point of it			1
when i go to see @entity89 play against @entity19 i want to see the best @entity89 players play against the best @entity25 players			1
not a few ringers who are n't good enough to play for other countries			0
of course , clinging on to a view that footballers should only play for the country in which they were born will these days lead to accusations of xenophobia or discrimination			0
but those accusations are lazy and unintelligent			0
international football should always be about one country against another			0
there is nothing wrong or racist about that			0
but a @entity22 playing for @entity87 , an @entity57 for @entity19 and several englishmen playing for @entity131 dilutes the passion of the occasion			1
it 's become more about players enhancing their careers when it should be about the passion you feel for your country			2
and that just is n't right .			0

national teams *increasingly* field players born outside their country
@entity87 's @entity88 and @entity19 's @entity21 were both born in @entity22
@entity27 - born striker , @entity26 , is also in @entity29 's squad
@entity91 was born in @entity92 but has lived in @entity89 for *15* years
but @entity128 had n't been to @entity131 before debut last week
