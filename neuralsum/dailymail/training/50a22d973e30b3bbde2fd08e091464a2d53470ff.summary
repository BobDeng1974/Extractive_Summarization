ageing , written off , derided			2
it just had to be @entity2 who scored the £ 134million goal that took @entity4 back into the @entity5 and quite probably saved them from financial ruin			1
having been dominated by @entity8 ’s youthful and energetic @entity7 for 89 minutes , 50 seconds , rickety old @entity4 and their 33 - year - old centre forward only needed one late glimpse to separate the men from the boys			1
@entity14 skipper @entity13 mistimed a clearance straight to the injury - prone striker and he returned it in a flash into the top corner of the net			1
subs not used : @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62			2
@entity4 : @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 ( @entity68 67 ) , @entity69 , @entity40 , @entity70 , @entity71 ( @entity72 33 ) , @entity73 , @entity74 ( @entity2 57 )			1
subs not used : @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity51 , @entity78			2
sent off : @entity70 ( 60 )			1
booked : @entity2 goals : @entity2 90 @entity80 : 87,348 referee : @entity82 ( @entity83 ) @entity38 was besieged on the touchline , owner @entity39 looked as if he ’d just escaped a heart attack			1
with 10 second left , @entity4 were back in the promised land , and that despite playing the majority of the second - half with only 10 men following @entity92 ’s red card			1
for two years , @entity95 and @entity39 have rightly received savage criticism as a squad paid more than @entity98 were relegated and then failed to ignite the @entity99			2
@entity2 was one of the poster - boys for underachievement			1
he went into yesterday ’s showpiece at @entity103 having scored four goals in 20 months , though in mitigation he missed four months of this season to recover from a knee operation			2
and yet in a split - second , he showed the quality that once won him a couple of @entity112 caps and persuaded @entity4 to spend £ 6million on him at the start of 2012			1
his instant left - foot finish had @entity7 keeper @entity33 clutching thin air			2
@entity13 was inconsolable for the rest of the afternoon , and possibly all summer			2
@entity2 is one of 15 players out of contract at @entity119 this season			1
it may turn out to be his last game in a @entity4 shirt but even if that ’s the case his place in the club ’s history is now assured			1
the club ‘ s latest financial figures reported a loss of £ 65m			2
even by the unreal standards of the @entity99 play - off final , @entity95 needed this result to go their way			0
early bath : @entity70 holds his head in his hands after being sent off hacked down : @entity53 is fouled from behind by @entity70 ‘ i do n’t know how we did it , ’ admitted a relieved and stunned @entity38 afterwards			1
‘ it was an amazing finish			0
we were hanging on and looking to get to extra-time			0
that was the only hope i could see for us with 10 men , i wanted to keep it tight and get to penalties , i ’d be lying if i said otherwise			0
‘ i was surprised to score ! but when @entity2 is fit , he is an excellent player			1
‘ it was just a backs - to - the - wall job before then			0
i think we defended well with 10 men ; @entity63 , @entity150 , @entity151 , they all defended for their lives			0
’ @entity38 embraced @entity39 afterwards			0
@entity2 ’s stike has saved both from different types of oblivion			1
@entity7 had finished the regular season in third place , five points ahead of @entity95 , and were the better team at @entity103 foiled repeatedly by @entity4 keeper @entity63 , whose own career is back on the up after his @entity164 horribilis in 2010			1
missed opportunity : @entity166 rues a missed chance on the run : @entity69 takes on @entity169 as he runs towards the goal whipping it in : @entity69 looks to get his cross in under the challenge of @entity48 ‘ football is a cruel game , ’ said @entity14 manager @entity8 , who replaced @entity174 in september when the club were 14th			2
‘ we controlled the game , one lapse at the end and we lose			0
but i ’m so proud of the players			0
‘ it is going to take few days and weeks to recover			0
we stayed on the field afterwards to applaud @entity4 and watch them celebrate and pick up the cup , go into the @entity5			1
‘ we do n’t want that kind of hurt again , because it does hurt			0
maybe we will try to go straight up next time ! but if this team sticks together , it will get stronger			0
’ despite a heavy and dramatic downpour as the teams came out , @entity8 did n’t emerge with the brolly he infamously used on his last @entity103 appearance as @entity112 manager in 2007			0
the first half was largely forgettable with @entity82 rightly waving away a @entity7 penalty appeal when @entity51 jumped over @entity150 the only moment of controversy			2
running from the brolly : derby manager @entity8 looks to avoid the rain on he goes : @entity7 's @entity49 looks to beat @entity71 come here : @entity4 's @entity40 looks to chase down @entity48 but as the sun peeped out at the start of the second half , the serious action began – and nearly all of it in and around the @entity4 penalty area			1
@entity63 made great saves from @entity56 , @entity52 and @entity54			0
@entity56 ’s goalbound shot was blocked by his own player @entity55 as @entity7 outran @entity95 and laid siege to the goal			2
@entity7 thought they ’d cracked it after an hour			0
@entity53 nicked the ball past @entity66 and when his heels were clipped by @entity92 , the @entity95 man went after discussion between mr @entity219 and his assistant			0
@entity14 swarmed forward but the @entity95 rearguard would n’t crack			0
from the side , @entity8 must have rued the good work he did at the start of the season as @entity4 ’s defensive coach before moving to @entity7			1
showing their colours : derby fans cheer on their team flying the flag : @entity4 fans show their support for their team outnumbered : @entity72 has a shot at goal during the play - off final as they were pushed back in the closing stages , one thing @entity95 could count on was bags of know how with @entity40 , @entity68 and @entity66 in the side			1
and defender @entity151 admitted : ‘ with the amount of experience we have in this side , even in adversity we have a second game plan			0
to get the result feels fantastic			0
we must love to do things the hard way but it means twice as much now			0
’ extra-time looked inevitable until with the seconds ticking down , @entity7 sat back for the first time			0
@entity95 won a couple of cheap throw - ins , @entity2 loitered with intent in the penalty area and when the chance came , he changed history .			1

@entity2 scores last minute goal to send @entity4 to the @entity5
promotion worth £ 134million to @entity4 as they return to the top flight at first attempt
@entity4 had @entity70 sent off *midway* through the second half
