@entity1 prime minister @entity0 has hit back at criticism of his country by @entity5 boss @entity4 the @entity1 prime minister has hit back at stinging criticism of his country by @entity5 boss @entity8 - by suggesting the department boss was drunk			1
mr @entity4 said last week that @entity1 was ' hopeless and downbeat ' and described the @entity11 train station @entity12 as ' the squalor pit of @entity14 '			1
but during a visit to @entity16 , @entity1 premier @entity0 described the remarks as ' absurd ' and suggested the retail boss had ' drunk too much beer '			1
mr @entity4 has since apologised for last week 's comments , in which he urged those with investments there to ' get them out quickly ' on an official visit to the @entity16 , during which he met @entity26 , mr @entity0 lambasted the @entity16 trait of ' @entity1 bashing ' , which he described as ' not particularly pleasant '			1
singling out mr street - though refusing to name him - the @entity1 prime minister said : ' this business leader has had to apologise			1
he made some absurd statements			0
' perhaps he ’d drunk too much beer			2
he announced an investment in @entity1 and then said @entity1 is finished			2
' one has to show a bit of respect			0
' but he did acknowledge the light - hearted nature of the @entity5 boss 's attack			2
mr @entity4 's comments , at an event marking the end of a @entity5 competition for start - ups , came after he had been in @entity11 to collect an award for the business at the @entity46			1
he said : ' you get on @entity48 from something i can only describe as the squalor pit of @entity14 , @entity12 , and you get off at a modern , forward - looking station [ @entity53 ]			0
‘ i have never been to a country more ill at ease … nothing works and worse , nobody cares about it			0
’ mr @entity4 also said that the award he had been given was ' made of plastic and is frankly revolting '			1
' if i needed any further evidence of a country in decline , here it is			0
every time i [ see it ] , i shall think , @entity67 help @entity1			2
@entity4 ( pictured ) said last week that @entity1 was ' finished ' and urged those with investments there to ' get them out quickly '			1
' if you 've got any investments in @entity1 business , get them out quickly			2
' but after the remarks were publicised , the 50 - year - old @entity76 graduate , who joined @entity5 from university 30 years ago , was forced to backtrack in a statement issued by @entity5			2
he said : ' the remarks i made were supposed to be lighthearted views , and tongue in cheek			0
on reflection i clearly went too far			0
' i regret the comments , and apologise unreservedly			0
' but the apology came too late to avoid a response from the @entity1 embassy , which said : ‘ @entity1 is the fifth biggest economy in the world ... so obviously many foreign businesses do not seem to share mr street ’s view			1
’ @entity1 is @entity5 ' second biggest market and it is about to open a @entity1 website			1
the graph shows the sales figures for the week ending september 27 for @entity5 , which shows that it was 15 per cent ahead of last year - the retail giant now turns over more than @entity102 @entity104 grandee @entity103 said mr street ’s comments were ‘ very silly ’ and ‘ mindless ’			1
the high profile businessman and former lord mayor of london added : ‘ it ’s completely inappropriate for someone running a big company to do this			0
it does n’t matter whether the criticism is right or wrong			0
’ but mr street ’s comments struck a chord with some in the business community , who believe the 75 per cent tax on top earners introduced by @entity120 president @entity119 and the country ’s labour laws – including a 35 - hour week – have stunted the economy			0
this morning @entity5 said it would be making no further comment on the matter .			0

@entity5 managing *director* @entity4 had said @entity1 was ' hopeless and down beat '
mr @entity4 has apologised saying comments were meant to be ' lighthearted '
but @entity1 prime minister hits back suggesting mr @entity4 had ' drunk too much beer '
@entity0 described the comments as ' absurd ' and hit out at @entity16 trait of ' @entity1 bashing '
