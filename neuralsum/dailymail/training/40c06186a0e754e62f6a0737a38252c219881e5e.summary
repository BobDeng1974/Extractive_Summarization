mr @entity10 is establishing a joint committee of mps and peers to scrutinise each of the proposals – a move which could delay the decision until 2014			1
but @entity0 , who stood down as justice minister in september , said the draft bill would ‘ merely kick the can down the street ’			1
the @entity31 mp called for decisive action to ‘ end the writ of the @entity5 ’			0
he said : ‘ that would enable @entity35 and our own courts to strike a proper balance between rights and responsibilities , with respect for the democratic will			0
‘ we should n’t defy the @entity5 – we should resign from it altogether			0
’ @entity1 is free to walk away from the court , provided it gives six months ’ notice			1

the government had been given until today by @entity14 to respond to a 2005 ruling that it is unlawful to ban all convicted prisoners from voting			1
justice secretary @entity10 makes a statement to the @entity55 about proposals on prisoner voting , including the option of retaining the ban the government had been given until today by @entity14 to respond to a 2005 ruling that it is unlawful to ban all convicted prisoners from voting @entity64 and a string of senior ministers have made plain their disgust at the idea of giving rapists , murderers and robbers the vote			1
mr @entity10 is hoping to end the stand - off – or at least buy more time – by giving mps a fresh vote			1
but some @entity75 fear @entity14 will not be satisfied and will order @entity1 to make compensation payouts to inmates who claim their ‘ human rights ’ have been breached			1
an estimated 3,000 prisoners are lining - up to claim a windfall from the taxpayer of around £ 1,000 each			2
in a @entity84 statement , mr @entity10 suggested he could block prisoners getting access to legal aid to help them mount their legal challenges			2

but it was immediately clear the @entity101 is split over the issue			0
@entity48 , a @entity48 justice minister , indicated he is in favour			2
@entity104 , the @entity31 attorney general , has himself warned @entity1 could become a ‘ pariah ’ if it does not obey @entity14			1

he added : ‘ it was never the intention of the framers to give @entity118 and @entity119 the vote			0
’ fellow backbencher @entity121 applauded mr @entity10 for seeking to make ‘ this @entity35 sovereign and ignoring a @entity124 court in @entity112 ’			2
however , the @entity126 ’s @entity125 made it clear the court was in no mood to tolerate further delays			0
@entity131 said : ‘ it ’s been seven years since the initial judgment , so a long time has passed since the ruling and the government has asked for extensions , so we would like to see the judgment implemented			0
' the @entity1 decided to delegate some small part of its sovereignty to the @entity126 when it joined and when it agreed to abide by the rulings of the court			2
’ the committee is expected to begin examining the options next year , a process that could take a year or more			0
the @entity148 court is expected to meet early next month to decide its formal response to the draft bill .			1
