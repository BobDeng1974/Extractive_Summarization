teens learning to drive are used to their parents watching their every step			1
however , one @entity5 couple has raised the bar with a hi - tech monitor than can analyse every detail of their 16 year old son 's drives - and automatically tell both him and them where he 's going wrong			1
californians @entity12 and @entity14 decided to take matters into their own hands after realising their son was about to start learning - and first invented the device first themselves			1
it comes with a free app that users install on their smart phone			2
the @entity22 app communicates via @entity33 with the drive to collect data while they drive and sends it to @entity22 ’s secure platform			2
the platform does all the number crunching and converts the raw data into information that is actually useful to users			0
it took a year to put the plan together and launch the company , and throughout the process , their son @entity46 was using the device , which can send data on driving patterns to an app. the firm is now accepting preorders - and luckily still has a test subject in the family			1
' our son is 16 now , and actually got his license a few weeks ago , ' mr @entity56 told @entity60			1
' he is using it - and actually says he 's learning quite a bit , and it really gives us peace of mind as well			0
' @entity66 works using a small transmitter that plugs into a car 's @entity69 port			1
using a built - in accelerometer , @entity66 takes monitors g - forces that translate to abrupt acceleration , deceleration and swerving , all of which are reported via the app at the end of each trip			1
using the driver 's phones gps , @entity66 also will automatically alert others when you 've arrived at your destination			1
' know if your family , and especially teens , are driving safely , ' the firm boasts			2
mr @entity56 said the firm will produce two versions - one for families , and one for corporate fleet managers			0
' we are focused on the family fleet - it can work across multiple cars , and the app can show all our children			2
the app can give each drive a score - and tell parents how their child is doing ' for instance , in our family we have three cars and three drivers - and i can see data from all of them in the app. the project is now for preorders , and the first products are expected to ship in july			1
@entity46 's mother and the company 's co-founder @entity115 said she came up with the idea while driving him to school			2
' over a year ago during an early morning drive to my son ’s high school , he reminded me that within a year he could be driving his own car , ' said @entity115			1
' this got me thinking			0
would he drive safely ? what if he did n’t ? would i even know ? with all the technology inside today ’s cars would n’t it be nice to know what is going on with the car when i am not riding in it ? ' she said after carrying out some research , the pair realised there was a niche in the market			0
' i found that although there were a few products out there that deal with parts of this puzzle , there was no complete and affordable solution out there to bridge the gap between the data available in my car and my daily life			0
' @entity12 and @entity115 , 46 , @entity151 emigrants who met pursuing computer science master 's degrees at @entity153 , decided to build a suitable gadget themselves			0
it can also show alerts such and low fuel or when the engine needs checking another key feature of @entity22 ’s solution is the ability to track car performance			0
users receive information from a vehicle ’s internal system providing information on items such as the check engine light or fuel efficiency			0
' over 75 % of car owners we ’ve talked to use the sticker on the windshield to track their routine maintenance schedule , ' the firm says			0
' @entity66 is replacing that service sticker and putting the power and control back into the hands of the car owner			1
' with @entity22 , users will have unprecedented insight into their vehicles which may not only save them money , but potentially their lives			0
' @entity187 from @entity56 on @entity188 .			0

@entity66 monitors driving habits and gives drivers tips through an app
parents claim they wanted to make their son a better driver
