a photographer has created his own surrealist dreamworld to escape the boredom of his day job			2
@entity4 , 28 , used pictures taken every day for year to put together a collection of mind - bending illusions , including a floating house and mystical forest , to feed his creative urges			1
the conceptual photographer from @entity13 , who works as a retail manager by day , then combined the images in layers to create the stunning dream - like pictures			1
mind - bending : conceptual photographer @entity4 , 28 , took an image a day for a year - using them to create surreal images			1
here he is seen staring at a house suspended by a balloon hanging on : the retail manager from @entity13 was bored of his job and felt the need to ignite his creative urge jumping through hoops : mr @entity4 took a number of photographs and enhanced them to create images that would be nearly impossible in the real world rocket power : the collection - including this image of mr @entity4 strapped to a rocket - stretches the boundaries of reality he said : ' the retail job is my " real person job " but i would argue that it makes me less of a real person			1
photography has always been second nature to me , both because i 've done it since i was 15 and because it is just how my mind works			2
' it was time to realise the full potential of my creativity , and what better way to do so than to exercise it every day ? ' he added			2
' i suppose you could call it surrealism			0
for me , it is just a further investigation of the unknown and the unknowable			0
' when mr @entity4 had lucid dreams , he wrote them down in an idea journal			1
he would then try to translate the visions into an image			0
' everything i photograph is real , and made to look real , but it is simply ordered in a way that renders the scene unreal			0
' the runaways : this image shows a suitcase being flung out of the back of the car , with mr @entity4 's female passenger desperately trying to retrieve it reflection : this picture from the collection shows him climbing a step ladder and removing a piece of the blue sky images in the project include one which sees the photographer taking the sun from the sky to inspect it , and another in which a castle is carried away by a balloon			1
he said : ' when you write everything down that you think of , sometimes you will get some crazy stuff			0
' mr @entity4 has a degree in film and has been interested in cinema and photography since he was in high school			1
until the beginning of 2013 mr @entity4 was only interested in documentary making but after a series of failed attempts to get films made he was led back to photography			2
he said : ' i let my imagination take the lead and it became apparent very quickly that through conceptual and surreal photography my voice speaks the loudest and with the most conviction i have realized recently that i only really care about two things : love and inspiration			2
everything else is just a job			0
' he and his wife @entity116 are expecting twins and though the project was hard on both of them he is happy to have completed it			0
it was not easy for her			0
she had to deal with everything while i was doing this			0
' sneak peak : standing in wintry conditions , mr @entity4 pushes aside a curtain to reveal a sunnier scene behind fallen : mr @entity4 stands next to the sun which has dropped from the sky and melted a gap in the snow trip : a shoe flies in the air as mr @entity4 is seen periously falling backwards down a set of stairs fire : this incredible image shows the photographer bursting into flames in the middle of a lake while lighting a cigarette burn after reading : the newspaper suddenly bursts into flames in this photo while a concerned mr @entity4 is reading it stunning : the photographer used multiple photos of biplanes to create this image of the aircraft soaring overhead a miniature world : mr @entity4 walks towards a ray of sunshine which has broken through a gap in the trees of this mystical forest			1
