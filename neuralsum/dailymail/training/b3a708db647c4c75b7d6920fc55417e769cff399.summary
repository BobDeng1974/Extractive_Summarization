even a short term diet of junk food can have a detrimental effect on the brain 's cognitive ability , scientists said everyone knows that junk food is bad for the waistline , but new research suggests it can damage memory , too			1
@entity13 researchers found that even a short term diet of junk food can have a detrimental effect on the brain ’s cognitive ability			1
the study suggests that obesity can trigger rapid changes in the brain			1
scientists from the @entity23 ( @entity23 ) showed for the first time that rats fed a diet high in fat and sugar had impaired memory after just a week			1
interestingly , the results were similarly poor for the rats fed a healthy diet that had been given sugar water to drink , according to the study , which was published in the journal @entity36			1
the animals found it more difficult to recognise specific places after their junk food diet and showed a lesser ability to notice when an object shifted to a new location			1
the mice also had inflammation of the hippocampal region of the brain , which is associated with spatial memory			2
‘ we know that obesity causes inflammation in the body , but we did n't realise until recently that it also causes changes in the brain , ’ said professor @entity49 from @entity50 , who co-authored the study			2
‘ what is so surprising about this research is the speed with which the deterioration of the cognition occurred , ’ she said			0
‘ our preliminary data also suggests that the damage is not reversed when the rats are switched back to a healthy diet , which is very concerning			1
’ some aspects of the animals ' memories were spared , regardless of their diets			0
all the animals were equally able to recognise objects after eating either the healthy , healthy with sugar or ‘ cafeteria ’ diets , the latter of which was high in fat and sugar , including cake , chips and biscuits			2
the change in the animals ' memory appeared even before the mice eating junk food gained any weight			1
the research builds on previous work that has implications for obesity			0
' given that high energy foods can impair the function of the hippocampus , if you eat a lot of them it may contribute to weight gain , by interfering with your episodic memory , ¿ professor @entity93 said ongoing work will attempt to establish how to stop the inflammation in the brain of animals with the unhealthy diets , which could unlock secrets relating to humans who eat unhealthily			2
‘ we suspect that these findings may be relevant to people , ’ said professor @entity93			0
‘ while nutrition affects the brain at every age , it is critical as we get older and may be important in preventing cognitive decline			0
an elderly person with poor diet may be more likely to have problems			0

‘ people might be less aware of their internal cues like hunger pangs and knowing when they have had enough , ’ she said .			0
