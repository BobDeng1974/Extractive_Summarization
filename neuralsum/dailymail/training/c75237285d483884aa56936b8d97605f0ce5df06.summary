rare shots of hyenas hunting buffalos , bathing hippos and a solitary giraffe on the plains of the @entity6 have been captured using a homemade helicopter drone			1
@entity9 wildlife photographer @entity8 designed the @entity10 so he could get up close and personal with the animals without scaring them off , or endangering his life			1
he previously designed the @entity14 , a hidden camera that can be driven across the region , but created the drone to take unique aerial shots			2
it is capable of flying for up to 15 minutes at a time and the @entity6 footage was taken on a @entity26 camera			1
@entity27 , pictured in the background , was able to control the copter from up to a kilometre away via a live video feed the remote - controlled @entity20 is powered by six mini-rotors and is capable of flying for about 15 minutes at a time			1
a variety of cameras can be used and are fitted to the stabilised gimbal - a support that pivots on a single axis - suspended under the body of copter			0
@entity27 was able to control the copter from up to a kilometre away using a live video feed and remote screen			1
he also used virtual - reality goggles ‘ like a computer game ’ to immerse himself in the shoot			0
it took five months from august 2013			0
@entity27 is originally from @entity47 in @entity48 but currently lives in @entity49			0
his remote - controlled device is powered by six mini-rotors and capable of flying for about 15 minutes at a time			1
the camera is attached to a stabilised gimbal - a support that pivots on a single axis - suspended under the body of copter			2
the 30 - year - old spent five months from august 2013 building and learning to fly the @entity10 before taking it out from a spin in the @entity6 in @entity49			1
his footage was recorded over a two - week period and was shot on a @entity65 3 +			1
@entity27 was able to control the copter from up to a kilometre away using a live video feed and remote screen			1
he also used virtual - reality goggles ‘ like a computer game ’ to immerse himself in the shoot			0
a close up aerial shot of a hyena with a dead buffalo in the @entity6			2
@entity9 wildlife photographer @entity8 spent five months building a homemade drone fitted with a camera to record these images during two weeks in @entity49 last year ‘ these devices have incredible potential in wildlife filmmaking and photography , ’ explained @entity27			1
‘ they are much smaller and quieter than a full - blown helicopter so you can get really close to the wildlife without spooking them			2
' during his filming he captured sweeping images of migrating wildebeest and antelope as well as more intimate shots of giraffes and hippos			1
the drone was able to capture this sweeping image of a herd of migrating wildebeest , pictured , as it travelled from @entity49 on its way to the @entity101 the @entity20 was also able to capture this image of a solitary giraffe			1
@entity27 said he designed the drone so he could get up close and personal with the animals without ' spooking them '			1
he added its perfect because its ' quiet and easily manoeuvrable ' an aerial shot of hippos bathing in the @entity111			2
@entity27 has built a total of eight @entity113 , capable of carrying everything from a lightweight @entity26 camera , to a full - sized dslr camera , and is building further models for fellow wildlife photographers and videographers ' there is quite a lot of excitement about the possibilities , ’ he continued			1
‘ i have really only scratched the surface			0
’ but development has been far from plain sailing after @entity27 ' wrote - off ' his @entity10 by ploughing it into a tree during testing			2
he said : ‘ it took a while to get a hang of them			0
you need have a fair bit of practice before you can start filming , especially when dealing with longer ranges when you ca n't really see the copter because it is so far away			0
' the animals also react differently to it			0
larger animals do n't really see things in the air as a threat because their predators are land - based			0
the hyena in the video was really relaxed and only leaned in to sniff it briefly			0
‘ but i think something like a meerkat would be very spooked by it			0
’ other shots captured by the @entity20 include this aerial view of a herd of elephants			1
the photographer claimed larger animals were n't fazed by the drone because they do n't see objects in the air as a threat			2
this is because their predators are usually land - based by using a @entity26 camera , @entity27 's shots had a spherical appearance , such as this sweeping image of antelopes			1
the camera was also lightweight enough to make the drone capable of flying for longer distances and using less battery power			0
there are 91 species of antelope , most of which are native to @entity179 @entity27 , who studied physics at university , made his name with the @entity14 , a remote - control land - based camera			1
he now owns a fleet of eight @entity113 , capable of carrying a everything from a @entity26 to a full - sized dslr camera , and is building further models for fellow wildlife photographers and videographers			2
he hopes to use his fleet of @entity113 to capture more amazing pictures and video across @entity179			0
he added : ‘ it is such a different perspective and people have been amazed by the results			0
my focus now is to further minimise the sound so that i can get closer to animals without disturbing them			0
’ the name of the @entity6 , pictured , comes from the @entity101 language of @entity204			2
the term @entity205 ' means ' endless plains '			0
it is one of seven @entity210 and is home to around 70 mammals and 500 bird species this shot shows the sun rising over the @entity6 as morning mist travels through the trees			0

the footage was captured by wildlife photographer @entity8 during a two - week stay in the @entity6
his remote - controlled homemade @entity20 is powered by six mini-rotors can fly for up to 15 minutes at a time
@entity27 was able to control the copter from up to one kilometre away via a live feed and remote screen
shots of hunting hyenas , migrating wildebeest and bathing hippos were captured using a @entity233 + camera
photographer claims the drone is perfect for getting close to the animals without ' spooking them ’
