uber drivers protesting unfair working conditions and poor fares protested outside the company 's @entity4 offices monday			1
most of the drivers are either @entity8 or black car operators and planned the protest after refusing to drive for @entity11 and in some cases going so far as to jump to rival business @entity13			1

uber drivers protesting unfair working conditions and poor fares protested outside the company 's @entity4 offices monday the strikers urged drivers to support them by shuting off their phones or refusing any @entity11 requests			1
other drivers have posted about the strike to the company 's @entity27 , though @entity11 quickly deleted the posts			1
@entity30 reports that one of the driver 's major issues is that @entity11 slashed driver 's wages by extending summer discounts into the fall			1
they also complain that @entity8 and black car drivers have been forced to take lower rates for @entity41 riders - a non luxury counterpart to the company 's black car service that carries a lower rate			1
drivers said that by using taking @entity41 passengers they were making less than they would working only as a black car driver			2
and though they 've attempted to opt out and work only as premium driver , they continue to receive @entity41 requests			2
if they take only suv or black car requests , @entity11 could assign them low rider acceptance rates or temporarilly suspend them			1
drivers said that by using taking @entity41 passengers they were making less than they would working only as a black car driver ' @entity11 is basically abusing the driver , ' said one driver who asked to be referred to as only @entity59			1
' they give us a 24 hour suspension and threaten that you will lose your chance with @entity11			2
to get a ride for $ 8.00 , i ’ll have to work the whole day			0
gas and insurance for @entity8 ’s are expensive			0
i have to pay $ 80 to $ 100 a day in gas			0
' he said since the company reduced fares in july to try and beat yellow cab @entity41 requests have skyrocketed			2
' they make us work for @entity41 permanently because we received tons of @entity41 calls per minute , ' @entity59 said			2
' this means we never get the chance to accept black car or @entity8 cars			2
we can only pick @entity82			0
it ’s a strategy for them to put us to work only for @entity41			0
if they take only suv or black car requests , @entity11 could asssign them low rider acceptance rates or temporarilly suspend them ' they ’ll forget that @entity91 drivers have been doing this business for 20 years , ' he added			1
' they have more experience than @entity11 and all the management of @entity91			2
and @entity11 is not a company it ’s an application			1
the value of @entity11 , it ’s our value			0
we are the ones who are offering the service			0
@entity11 is not doing anything , it ’s an application on the phone			0
@entity11 did n’t pay for our cars			1
@entity11 is only a connection			0
' but it remains to be seen if the strike will have any effect , as @entity59 agreed that management did not seem bothered by the protest			0
' they said to take it or leave it , ' he said			0
the drivers may not be able to exert real pressure on the company as many of them who bought a car specifically to become @entity91 drivers will likely have to continue contracting regardless of the company 's fare changes			1
but it remains to be seen if the strike will have any effect , as drivers agreed that management did not seem bothered by the protest			0
' we get expensive cars , most of the drivers if they give it back to the bank they ’ll lessen their credit score , ' @entity59 told @entity30			0
' @entity11 right now is putting us in a dangerous situation			0
we ’re not making a living but they ’re pushing us to give back the cars			1
' even those drivers without luxury cars are feeling squeezed as @entity11 's rates - while a good deal for riders - force them to work longer hours with no tips for what they could make in normal hours as a taxi driver			1
' the average driver was putting in 2 or 3 hours extra a day to make the same money they were making before reduced prices … when they switched the prices as an @entity156 driver , i ’m hardly paying my bills , [ i ’m ] working 8 to 10 hours a day , six days a week , ' said a driver who drove a @entity159			1
' i have to pay for tolls and gas … [ and make ] $ 7 to 800 a week — which is not enough any more			0

drivers protested at the company 's @entity4 office and shut off their phones , refusing to take @entity11 *customer* requests
@entity11 's attempts to *undercut* taxi prices is making it *impossible* to earn a living
with many cars leased specifically to work for @entity11 , drivers may have little *bargaining* power and be forced to accept wages less than they would make as normal taxi drivers
