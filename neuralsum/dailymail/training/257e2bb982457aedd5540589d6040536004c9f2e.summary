@entity0 is tired of visitors asking about her store 's name or snapping pictures of the sign outside			2
unfortunately , that 's life for a small business owner whose shop — @entity10 and @entity11 — shares a name with @entity13 , the acronym of a notorious @entity16 militant group that the @entity17 is fighting in @entity18 and @entity19			1
' i 'm just like , " come on ! " ' she says			2
' i get what 's going on , but can you see it 's a store ? ' unfortunate : businesses ' reactions range from horror to indifference at the association that 's being made between the @entity31 terror group and their names , which are often references to the @entity34 goddess @entity0 denies any connection with the other @entity13 , which stands for the @entity36 , and says she wants to rename her store			1
' @entity13 ' is part of more than 270 product , service or business names among active federal trademarks , according to the @entity44			1
but businesses are not required to register their names , so it is difficult to say how many companies use ' @entity13 , ' which is also the name of an @entity34 and pagan goddess			1
for those companies , the ' @entity13 ' name can be damaging			1
branding experts say an unfortunate association with a name can scar a company 's reputation even if the connection is coincidental			0
that 's the case for @entity59 , a @entity60 company that makes weaves , wigs and hair pieces			0
ceo @entity64 says stores have told him that customers will put his company 's products back on the shelf after noticing the @entity13 label			1
daring : @entity71 apologized for a line of lingerie named ' @entity13 , ' but said it had no plans to drop the offering of bras , thongs and a babydoll threat : the terror group now calling itself the ' @entity31 ' has declared its aim of establishing a caliphate over the @entity83 , @entity84 and parts of @entity86 in the @entity88 , he 's heard that competitors have joked at trade shows about his business being tied to terrorists			1
' it 's so stressful , ' @entity64 says , noting that he has spent 20 years building the company 's reputation			0
' i 've lost all the benefit of the brand image			0
' @entity64 , who named his company after the @entity34 goddess , started removing the @entity13 label from some packages			1
but he 's reluctant to give up on such an established brand			0
he says he wishes the @entity17 and @entity86 media would stop referring to the militant group as @entity13			1
@entity59 has had no sales problems in @entity108 , where the media only refers to the group as the @entity31			0
another company , technology startup @entity109 , announced in september that it would change its name to @entity112			1
the joint venture involving @entity114 , @entity115 and @entity116 launched late last year with an app that allows people to use their smartphones while checking out at a store to get discounts and use credit or loyalty cards			1
by june , company leaders were thinking about rebranding to avoid confusion with the militant group , which had taken over large swaths of @entity18 and filmed beheadings of aid workers and journalists			2
' however coincidental , we have no desire to share a name with this group , and our hearts go out to those affected by this violence , ' ceo @entity131 said in a blog post announcing the new name			2
softcard partners with major companies like @entity143 and executives were worried about asking those partners to continue promoting a product named @entity13			1
' we did n't want to put anybody in a bad situation , ' says @entity149 , senior vice president of marketing			0
changing a brand or an established company name can be a costly and complex move			0
just finding a memorable name can be hard because the best ideas are often taken or trademarked , says @entity155 , managing director of the branding firm @entity156			0
' it 's not just have a pizza lunch and quickly come up with an alternative , ' he says			0
@entity161 's name change makes sense to @entity163 , a partner with the law firm of @entity165 who specializes in trademarks			0
he noted that the company is new and still building its image			0
with the old name , they would have had to take the extra step of explaining that they were n't tied to the @entity174			0
' brands are owned by companies , but it 's all in the public 's mind and you can only control so much , ' he says			1
more established brands that do n't deal directly with consumers may not take as much of a hit			2
@entity183 has no plans to change a brand it has built over 25 years			2
the @entity188 company partners with other companies to sell drugs it has developed			2
it does n't sell products directly to consumers , and its name does n't even appear on any of the products it helped develop			2
the company , which received funding from the @entity201 , benefactors of the viral @entity198 , says only a few investors have asked company officials about the name			1
' we 've been around for a while , ' says @entity207 , vice president of corporate communications			0
' they can easily distinguish between us and a @entity83 terrorist group			0

companies and brands named ' @entity13 ' are *reporting* reluctance among customers to *buy* their products
lingerie *designer* @entity71 apologized for their @entity13 line of bras , thongs and a cami *suspender* , but had no plans to drop it from their site
@entity227 , a *payment* app created by *collaboration* between @entity114 , @entity115 and @entity116 , changed its name to @entity231 in september to avoid the *comparison*
@entity234 , which is partially funded by the @entity201 , the *non*-*profit* that received money from the viral @entity198 , says the name has not affected their business with long *-* standing customers
