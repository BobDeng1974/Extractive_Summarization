i just can not understand why @entity1 has made such a statement			2
the first thing that surprises me is the timing , following one of the most exciting days ever in @entity6 and @entity8 history			0
@entity10 ’s victory over @entity11 was brilliant to watch , even if they did fall just short of winning the title			1
@entity13 was rocking and it was an amazing advert for the game ahead of a home @entity16			2
i ’m in @entity18 at present and on the flight the pilot , air stewardesses and all the passengers were talking about saturday and their real optimism for the @entity16			2
so for @entity1 to say finishing second is unacceptable just flattens the mood			2
it does n’t seem right and is a massive own goal			0
@entity28 ( second left ) consoles his players after falling six points short of a @entity8 title @entity10 captain @entity32 ( left ) and his team - mates came second for the fourth year in succession @entity35 celebrate his try during @entity10 's storming 55 - 35 @entity8 victory against @entity11 more importantly , his words undermine @entity28			1
i would go as far as to say he has belittled much of the progress that @entity41 and the team have achieved			0
if this had happened to me , i would be in @entity1 ’s office demanding an explanation			1
this is professional sport and being a head coach is a tough position			0
the moment someone says something , the opposition see a chink , a weakness , and try to drive a wedge through it			0
it ’s one thing to say these things in private , as professional sport is about winning , but to say them in public is wrong			0
if @entity28 has called the result unacceptable , fair enough , but @entity1 has no qualifications to talk about the team ’s performance			1
this year is all about preparing for the @entity16 and @entity10 put 55 points and seven tries on the board in style			1
the atmosphere at @entity13 for @entity10 's final @entity8 match was electric from start to finish this was the time for a pat on the back and a united front			2
@entity1 appointed @entity28 after an interim period , which was a brave decision when he had the opportunity to put in far more experienced coaches			1
he appointed an inexperienced coach in @entity41 yet later awarded him a six - year contract			0
if the priority was short - term gains , he should have been given a one - year contract			0
coming in with no international coaching experience , @entity28 has done a very good job			1
@entity88 and @entity89 are very strong teams too so to think you can just win @entity91 and championships is very naive and just brings back the tag that the @entity94 are arrogant			0
@entity1 ( right ) should be backing @entity41 ahead of the eagerly - anticipated @entity16 in september i ’m sure @entity1 had good intentions , perhaps wanting to be seen to be saying the right thing after another title miss. but he will regret what he said as @entity10 are in a very good position			1
if @entity10 are going to win the @entity16 , they have to have everybody together as one team , everybody ’s noses pointing in the same direction from the chief executive down to the water boys			1
we should all be feeling positive after such a brilliant display against @entity11 and looking forward to the @entity16			1
it ’s all positive .			0

@entity1 's words have undermined @entity10 coach @entity28
if this had happened to me , i would be in @entity1 ’s office demanding an explanation
this year is all about preparing for the @entity16
@entity10 put 55 points past @entity11 and should be *lauded* for that display
coming in with no international coaching experience , @entity28 has done a very good job
@entity1 will regret what he said as @entity10 are in a very good position
