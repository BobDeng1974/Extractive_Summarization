an @entity1 teacher is suing her rural school district over the lingering stress she feels following a surprise active shooter drill that administrators held in 2013			1
@entity6 was in her classroom at @entity8 in the tiny town of @entity10 in august of that year when a masked man in a hoodie burst in with a gun , lowered it to her head and pulled the trigger			1
the 56 - year - old elementary school teacher had no clue it was a drill to test her ' preparedness ' or that the gun was loaded with blanks			1
' you 're dead , ' the shooter said			2
shooter drill : @entity28 in @entity10 , @entity1 was the scene of a surprise ' active shooter ' drill that 's left teacher @entity6 with post-traumatic fears years later in fact , she believed for a several moments that she would soon die			1
now , years after learning of the ' harebrained scheme , ' @entity37 reports that @entity39 is still traumatized by the event			2
' @entity39 could not figure out what was going on , ' reads the lawsuit			0
' she felt very confused			0
she walked out of the classroom and saw a pistol lying on the ground ' she wondered if she was really shot and was going to die			1
' @entity48 was out of session that day and school officials had warned emergency services in the area not to show up should any teachers call 911			1
they also ran checks on all the teacher to make sure none of them had concealed weapons permits , should they decide to fight back			0
the two masked ' intruders ' stormed a room where several teachers had gathered			0
' it was shocking , ' teacher @entity62 admitted at the time , but ' it heightened my awareness about what 's around me			0
