@entity15 and @entity16 are expected to apply for a two - week extension from the stock market over their plans for the £ 30billion merger but with investors in revolt over the deal , the government admitted it is prepared to give ground to make it happen			1
defence secretary @entity39 said @entity10 could tolerate both @entity40 and @entity41 owning 9 per cent of the new company			1
and senior government sources said @entity44 was prepared to ‘ hit the phones ’ to thrash out a deal with @entity6 president @entity47 and @entity7 chancellor @entity48			1
that will enrage the 45 @entity51 mps who last week demanded the @entity52 block the deal unless @entity6 and @entity7 sell all their shares			1
the backlash grew yesterday when @entity15 ’s largest shareholder , @entity57 , denounced the deal			0
in a scathing attack , @entity57 ’s @entity59 said he had ‘ significant reservations ’ about the deal			0
his intervention adds to the opposition to a merger that threatens up to 50,000 @entity10 jobs			2

investors are in revolt over the deal @entity57 , which owns 13.3 per cent of @entity15 , warned the company would be ‘ driven more by political considerations than shareholder value creation ’			2
while @entity10 would retain a so - called ‘ golden share ’ in the new firm , this will have no monetary value and will only theoretically allow a veto on future takeovers			0
the two companies have until tomorrow to alert the stock market to their detailed plans			2
but mr @entity39 said : ‘ i do n’t think there ’s any chance of getting the deal done by wednesday			2
‘ we will want to make sure that @entity10 jobs , @entity10 strategic interests , @entity10 defence interests are protected			2

the government has admitted it is prepared to tolerate @entity40 and @entity41 owning a share in the new company @entity10 made : a @entity99 produced in @entity100 , @entity101 defence secretary @entity39 said wants to protect @entity10 interests the @entity6 and @entity7 are seeking to maintain control of up to 13.5 per cent of the new firm			1
but mr @entity39 said 9 per cent was the maximum the @entity10 would tolerate			1
he said : ‘ if the @entity6 government is prepared to reduce its stake and dismantle arrangements that have given it the ability to control the company , then with the addition of safeguards , a national security agreement , safeguards about where the company is headquartered , what the composition of the board will be , i think it will be possible to put something together			1
‘ what we ca n’t have is this business going forward with the @entity6 or @entity7 state able to direct its activity			1
that would not be acceptable			0
’ a senior cabinet minister also expressed doubts that a deal could be done with ‘ meddling ’ @entity131 politicians			0
he said : ‘ for @entity6 and @entity7 politicians it is axiomatic that they should own shares in companies like this			1
‘ when you say we do n’t think it is a role for governments to meddle in the running of these companies they look at you strangely			2
the problem is that they want a stake and the right to decide where things are built			0
‘ they do n’t understand where we are coming from at all			0
they are where we were in the 1970s before the @entity154 government			0
’ the government ’s position puts it at odds with investors and mps			2
last night @entity51 mp @entity160 said : ‘ it is time we stopped listening to bankers and started listening to investors			0
did we not learn anything from the financial crisis ? ’			0
