powerful winds in the @entity1 , which have driven surface heat deep underwater , could be the reason behind the current ‘ pause ’ in global warming			1
this is according to a joint @entity9 and @entity10 study which has looked at why there has been a slowdown in the planet ’s global average surface temperature over the past decade			1
their research shows that trade winds in central and eastern parts of the @entity1 have caused warm surface water to sink to the ocean 's depths , reducing the amount of heat in the atmosphere			1
sea surface temperature is the temperature of the top millimeter of the ocean 's surface			0
an anomaly is a departure from average conditions			0
some scientists believe winds in central and eastern parts of the @entity1 have caused warm surface water to sink to the ocean 's depths last year , scientists on the @entity42 ( @entity42 ) said the pace of temperature rise at the @entity46 's surface had slowed over the past 15 years			1
this is despite the fact concentrations of @entity49 and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere have increased to levels that are unprecedented in at least 800,000 years the latest study , published in the journal @entity55 , said stronger @entity1 trade winds - had made ocean circulation at the @entity59 speed up			1
this schematic shows the trends in temperature and ocean atmosphere circulation in the @entity1 over the past two decades			1
colour shading shows observed temperature trends ( ° c per decade ) during 1992 - 2011 at the sea surface			2
the bold and thin arrows show an overall acceleration of the @entity1 moving warm , surface waters ( indicated by the blue arrow ) to below 700 metres beneath the surface scientists claim one of the causes of the pause in sea - surface temperature is a change in the exchange of ocean water			2
they believe this exchange is occurring between warm , surface waters and cold , deep waters below 700 metres scientists claim one of the causes of the ‘ plateau ’ in sea - surface temperature is a change in the exchange of ocean water			2
they believe this exchange is occurring between warm , surface waters and cold , deep waters below 700 metres – as if the warming is ‘ hiding ’ underwater			2
@entity95 trade winds of the @entity1 have increased significantly over the past two decades and as a result are blowing higher volumes of warm surface sea water to deeper depths			1
stronger trade winds blowing from @entity102 to @entity9 have had the net effect of cooling surface temperatures by a global average of between 0.1 ° c and 0.2 ° c , this would be enough to account for the apparent hiatus in global average temperatures over the past 15 years			1
the warm water wo n’t hide below the surface forever : scientists believe that it may re-emerge later or affect other climate indicators , such as sea level or ocean circulation			0
this pattern of easterly winds , which spans the tropics , has moved heat deeper into the ocean and brought cooler water to the surface			2
the winds have also helped drive cooling in other ocean regions			0
‘ we show that a pronounced strengthening in @entity1 trade winds over the past two decades is sufficient to account for the cooling of the tropical @entity1 and a substantial slowdown in surface warming , ’ said the study , led by scientists from the @entity127 in @entity9			1
‘ the net effect of these anomalous winds is a cooling in the 2012 global average surface air temperature of 0.1 - 0.2 ° c , which can account for much of the hiatus in surface warming since 2001			1
’ the study 's authors , including scientists from other research centres and universities in the @entity10 , @entity145 and @entity9 , used weather forecasting and satellite data and climate models to make their conclusions			0
‘ this hiatus could persist for much of the present decade if the trade winds trends continue , however , rapid warming is expected to resume once the anomalous wind trends abate , ’ the study said			0
‘ if the anomalously strong trade winds begin to abate in the next few years , the model suggests the present hiatus will be short - lived , with rapid warming set to resume soon after the wind trends reverse , ’ it added			0
commenting on the study , @entity159 , professor of climate science at @entity162 's @entity161 , said : ‘ these changes are temporarily masking the effects of man - made global warming			0
’ the fact that temperatures have risen more slowly in the past 15 years despite rising greenhouse gas emissions has emboldened sceptics who challenge the evidence for man - made climate change and question the need for urgent action			1
the @entity42 does not expect the hiatus to last and has said temperatures from 2016 - 35 were likely to be 0.3 - 0.7 ° c warmer than in 1986 - 2005			1
‘ more than 93 per cent of the warming of the planet since 1970 is found in the ocean , ’ said @entity178 at @entity9 's @entity179 and lead author of the chapter on oceans in the @entity42 's latest climate report			2
‘ if we want to understand and track the evolution of climate change we need to look in the oceans			0
the oceans have continued to warm unabated , even during the recent ' hiatus ' in warming of surface temperature			0
’ climate scientists say such pauses in warming occur regularly throughout history and can last for up to 20 years – but can not be predicted			0
they add that the warm water wo n’t hide below the surface forever			0
scientists believe that it may re-emerge later or affect other climate indicators , such as sea level or ocean circulation .			0

@entity42 report last year said temperatures have *barely* risen in past 15 years
this is despite more greenhouse gases being *pumped* into atmosphere
new study claims winds in @entity1 have driven heat deep underwater
this has had a net effect of cooling surface temperatures by 0.1 ° c and 0.2 ° c
