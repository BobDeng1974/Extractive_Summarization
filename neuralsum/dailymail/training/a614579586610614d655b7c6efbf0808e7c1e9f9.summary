' unacceptable ' : @entity0 , the former @entity1 home affairs spokesman , is leading demands in the @entity3 for the publication of the @entity6 report @entity7 are to demand that the official report into the @entity10 war be published in the next few weeks – amid new fears it could be delayed until after the election			1
the £ 10million @entity6 inquiry into the disastrous invasion , which led to 100,000 deaths , was set up six years ago by @entity16 but its findings have still not been published			1
a cross-party group of @entity7 is challenging an alleged ‘ stitch - up ’ said to be delaying publication of the inquiry ’s report			1
the demand is being led by @entity0 , the former @entity1 home affairs spokesman , who described the failure to publish the document after more than 2,000 days as ‘ utterly unacceptable ’			0
‘ whatever the hold - ups and political wranglings that are delaying publication , the time has come to publish or be damned , ’ he said			1
‘ the suggestion that the report will be delayed until after the election , if it is not ready to be published by the end of february , further damages the inquiry ’s credibility and undermines the final report			1
’ the criticism comes a week after former @entity1 foreign secretary @entity39 said delays in the publication of the report were becoming a ‘ scandal ’			1
the government says the timing of its release is solely the concern of sir @entity47 , who led the inquiry and heard evidence in public from more than 120 witnesses			2
but last week it emerged that if the report is not submitted to ministers before the end of february , the government would not publish it before the election – claiming that there would not be enough time to debate it fully in @entity59			0
this argument is being questioned by a cross-party group of mps including mr @entity0 , former @entity1 attorney general @entity63 and former @entity65 home affairs minister @entity64			2
@entity67 mp @entity66 and @entity68 , the leader of @entity71 ’s @entity70 representatives , are also part of the group			1
mr @entity68 said he did not understand why the government had imposed the february deadline – saying that as @entity59 will not rise until the end of march , there would be plenty of time for a debate			0
he said he feared that @entity67 and the @entity83 – both of whose leaderships supported the 2003 war – had closed ranks to delay the report until after the election			1
‘ it could be a stitch - up between both benches , ’ he said			2
guilty conscience ? @entity92 , prime minister at the time of the @entity10 invasion in 2003 , looks drawn as he stands behind current @entity67 leader @entity95 at the @entity96 for @entity97 last year mr @entity68 said he understood that a draft version of the report had been finished almost five months ago			1
‘ it looks to me as if not enough effort is being made to publish it , ’ he said			0
‘ when things like war arise , you do have a closing - in			0
’ mr @entity64 told the @entity107 that there were ‘ serious questions that needed to be addressed and answered ’ before the election			0
‘ if there are people blocking publication , the @entity112 people need to know why , ’ he said			2
part of the reason for the delay is that those people criticised in the @entity6 report have been given the chance to respond to the criticism before publication			1
but writing for @entity124 , mr @entity0 said those facing criticism should not be allowed to hold back publication			2
he suggested that they be given a deadline of the end of january to give their response			0
‘ we are no more enlightened as to the failures in the lead - up to , during and after the @entity135 than we were in 2009 when @entity16 initiated the inquiry , ’ he wrote			0
‘ the perception of politicians and elites colluding to hide the truth from the public is damaging to all parties at a time when politicians are already held in poor regard			0
’ ‘ in any event this is not about personal culpability , of pinning the blame on a small group of individuals , but of collective and systemic failure			0
it is time to face up to whatever mistakes were made as a nation and consider how best we can avoid them in the future			0
‘ we can not allow the sensibilities of our allies , or our current or past politicians , to delay such an important publication any further			1
‘ whatever the ramifications , it is time to reveal the truth			0

the £ 10million inquiry into @entity10 invasion was set up six years ago
it *'s* findings have not been published and mps are wary of a stitch up
there are fears @entity67 and @entity83 are colluding to delay publication
