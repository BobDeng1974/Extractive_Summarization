by @entity0 published : 11:52 est , 12 december 2013 updated : 14:15 est , 12 december 2013 good news for the incorrigible rogues across @entity3 and @entity4 : you are no longer committing a crime			2
the offence , which came in under the @entity8 , is one of 309 to be repealed or removed from the statute book in the year to may			1
this is compared to 201 offences repealed in the previous 12 month period			1
other crimes removed in the period include ‘ solemnising marriage outside specified hours ’ under the @entity16			0
this was repealed by the @entity18 , which removed restrictions on the time of day marriages or civil partnerships can take place			0
it is no longer a criminal offence to be an incorrigible rogue in @entity3 and @entity4 ( stock picture ) the figures released by the @entity28 show only one offence – ‘ conspire to sell / transfer a pistol it being a prohibited weapon ’ - had any prosecutions from january 2008 to september 2013 , with a total of 16 prosecutions between 2011 and 2012			2
a total of 327 new criminal offences were created in the same period , a 12 per cent increase compared with the previous 12 months			1
there was only one indictable only offence created - that is , it is so serious it can only be tried in a crown court - under the @entity43 2013 , which makes it a crime to carry out activities in @entity46 , which directly or indirectly give rise to an environmental emergency and are connected with the @entity49			0
more than 300 offences were repealed and removed from the statute book in the year to may the @entity8 was an ‘ act for the punishment of idle and disorderly persons , and rogues and vagabonds ’			1
it was brought in to deal with problems in @entity3 following the @entity58 as large numbers of soldiers were discharged on to the streets with no job and no accommodation			0
@entity64 , which essentially made it an offence to sleep on the streets or to beg , is still in force but has been amended several times by later legislation			0
of the offences repealed in the period to may , 2 per cent were indictable - only offences , 51 per cent were summary - only offences , which can be tried in a magistrates ' court , and 47 per cent were triable either way .			2
