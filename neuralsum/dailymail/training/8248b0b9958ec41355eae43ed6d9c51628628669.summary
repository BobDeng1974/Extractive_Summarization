by @entity0 former teacher @entity1 decided to abandon both her clothes and the classroom to become a stand - up comedian at the @entity5 a former private school teacher has turned her back on education to star in her own one woman comedy show - totally naked - much to the approval of some of her former pupils			1
@entity1 , 43 , taught @entity13 at @entity14 in @entity15 , @entity16 , but decided to have a career change			1
now - under her stage name @entity18 - ms @entity1 is putting on her own show at the @entity5 next week titled ‘ the @entity21			1
’ ms @entity1 , who won ‘ most sarcastic teacher ’ in the sixth form year book many times , came up with the idea while vacuuming her home			1
she said : ' after i decided i wanted to do stand up , my next thought was what to wear , as an outfit tends to pigeonhole how you ’re perceived as a comedian			0
' i was struggling to think of a style and i thought " i ’ll just go naked " and then realised @entity34 sounded pretty good , so i went from there			1
' i ’m not brave , i ’m just past caring			0
it is just a body			0
i think we are so much more than a body			0
' ms @entity1 , from @entity40 , @entity16 , added : ' i enjoyed teaching but i felt like i was giving the kids all of my creativity and ideas , which i do n’t resent them for			1
' ' i think they used to think i was a bit different to the other teachers			0
i was awarded most sarcastic teacher a few years			2
' @entity49 is similar to teaching in a classroom in that you have to stand in front of an audience and command their attention			2
' the classic thing you need to know about me is that i used to be a school teacher			2
so if any of you do want to talk at the back during the show , you will be seeing me afterwards			2
and i will be keeping you behind			0
just to let you know it 's your time you 're wasting , not mine			2
' ' i ’ve seen some of my former pupils at my previous shows			0
they think it ’s great			0
' the teacher - turned comic quit her teaching job in 2005 after seven years in the role			1
she took a pay cut to work in advertising and became a pole dancing instructor and then a burlesque dancer in 2008 to boost her income			0
ms @entity1 will perform her naked stand up show at the @entity5 from august 1 to 24 , with only one night off on the 12th			1
her dry humoured script is based on observational jokes and pokes fun at the laws surrounding nudity			0
