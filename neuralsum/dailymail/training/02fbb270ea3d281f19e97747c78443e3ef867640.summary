details of the @entity2 ebola screening programme were revealed yesterday – but critics immediately dismissed it as not going far enough			1
while the @entity6 has announced it will test passengers with a thermal gun , the @entity2 response amounts to little more than a few questions			1
it will be introduced at @entity12 and @entity13 airports and @entity15 terminals for passengers travelling from the affected @entity18 regions			1
the tests will involve assessing passengers ’ recent travel history and who they have been in contact with , as well as a possible medical assessment			1
passengers from @entity26 , @entity27 or @entity28 will be identified by information passed from airlines and diverted into a separate queue at customs			1
if the medical staff are concerned , they will start a full assessment			2
but they will stop short of screening the temperatures of passengers using thermal guns , a procedure which will be adopted in the @entity6 this weekend			1
thermal screening , which was first used during the @entity58 sars outbreak in 2002 , picks out passengers who have an elevated temperature using an infrared temperature gun			1
while the @entity6 has announced it will test passengers with a thermal gun , the @entity2 response amounts to little more than a few questions a team of scientists at @entity68 in @entity69 have used air travel information to predict where the deadly ebola virus could reach in the next three weeks in the affected countries , 36,000 people have been tested and 77 have been stopped from boarding flights since health tests were introduced two months ago			1
they were identified after temperature checks found they had a fever			1
ultimately none of those stopped was diagnosed as having ebola			2
in many cases they were suffering from malaria , a disease rife in the region			2
experts have warned that screening will not necessarily pick up ebola sufferers because the virus has an incubation period of up to 21 days before symptoms emerge			1
academics argue that the easiest and most efficient way of stopping the spread of highly infectious diseases is to screen people before they fly out of the affected area			0
the government has so far announced few specific details about how it will implement the new screening checks at @entity12 and @entity13 airports and the @entity15 terminal at @entity104			1
professor @entity105 from the @entity106 , said questionnaires were a waste of time and that passengers would lie			2
academics argue that the easiest and most efficient way of stopping the spread of highly infectious diseases is to screen people before they fly out of the affected area he added : ‘ if last week your aunt died of ebola but you feel fine , are you going to be honest when you get to the airport and risk being detained and missing your holiday ? ’ @entity119 , chairman of the home affairs select committee , said it was prudent to carry out checks on passengers entering the @entity2			2
‘ targeted screening would help and if it discovers just one case it would make a huge difference , ’ he said			2
‘ we do n’t want to be in the position where they are in @entity130 , where one case has caused so much distress			0
’ writing for the @entity132 , @entity133 , the director of the @entity134 a the @entity135 , said those experts are loathed to discuss their concerns in public , for fear of whipping up hysteria			0
discussing the possible future course of the current outbreak , he said : ' the second possibility is one that virologists are loath to discuss openly but are definitely considering in private : that an ebola virus could mutate to become transmissible through the air			0
' but the chair of the @entity2 's @entity147 , professor @entity148 of the @entity149 , said it is impossible to predict how any virus will mutate			0
he said scientists across the world do not know enough about genetics to be able to say how the ebola virus will change over time			0
pointing to the example of the @entity158 influenza virus that saw bird flu sweep the globe in 2009 , dr @entity133 said : ' if certain mutations occurred , it would mean that just breathing would put one at risk of contracting @entity165			0
' but professor @entity148 , told @entity167 : ' no one can predict what will happen with the mutation of the virus			0
' i would like to see the evidence that this could become a respiratory virus			0
' the virus 's epidemiology is consistent with transmission via bodily secretions and excretions , which is exactly the same as other past epidemics			0
@entity181 , a professor of molecular virology at the @entity183 , sounded a note of caution			0
he said : ‘ temperature screening proved very effective at controlling the @entity188 outbreak , because you can spot those people who have a fever when they are at their most infectious			1
‘ with ebola , in a similar way , anyone who is infectious should be picked up			0
but in the incubation period of up to 21 days , when there are no symptoms and it is not infectious , it would not work and someone could slip through			0
my worry is that screening could engender a false sense of security			2

@entity206 orders screening at @entity12 and @entity13 , and @entity15
but passengers will only be asked questions , not thermal *-* scanned
thermal screening picks out passengers who have a high temperature
