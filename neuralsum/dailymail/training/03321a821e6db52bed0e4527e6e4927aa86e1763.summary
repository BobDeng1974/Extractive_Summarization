trendsetter : @entity1 in 1987 scaling the roof of the @entity4 commentary box to celebrate with family it has become one of @entity9 ’s more enduring images – champions scaling the roof of the @entity4 commentary box to celebrate with their watching family			1
but now health and safety concerns have put paid to what began as an impromptu celebration of success			1
all @entity20 officials have this year fitted a gate so instead of clambering on to the narrow ash felt roof and into the stands , players can walk up steps to the competitors ’ box			1
the move is expected to end to the practice started by @entity1 in 1987 and followed by many subsequent champions including @entity30 after his victory last year			1
disgruntled fans quickly nicknamed the new addition to @entity4 ‘ killjoy gate ’ and ‘ party - pooper gate ’			1
and cash himself seemed disappointed , telling @entity37 5 live : ‘ that ’s really taking the challenge out of it			0
if they ’re fit enough to win @entity9 , i think they should climb up or have some other sort of challenge			0
it ’s way too easy now			0
’ after his victorious match point in last year ’s final , an emotional @entity30 clambered through the stands at the @entity48 to embrace two rows of @entity50 , including then coach @entity51			1
ironically , @entity1 started the tradition after defeating then world number one @entity51			1
he has previously said that he ‘ knew it ’d be a first in pretty much any sport ’ but his rebellious nature spurred him on			0
he added : ‘ i do n’t think anybody knew what was going on as i ran over into the crowd … i got to the edge of the commentary box and i was worried that it might go crashing through – it was just a little booth with no proper roof … it held , thankfully			2
‘ i gave everyone in the team area a hug – princess @entity68 and the royals were in the box next door , but i quickly decided against continuing my climb			2
’ @entity73 tennis star @entity30 also climbed to see his family when he won the @entity9 title last year it became a @entity9 tradition that has been followed by many other champions at other @entity80 events			1
however , not all have rushed to the stands			0
seven times winner @entity82 has always shunned the tradition because he believes it is unfair to leave the runner - up alone on the court			0
@entity88 player @entity87 , who celebrated his first @entity9 title in 2011 by eating the grass , said climbing up to the players ’ box was an important tradition			2
he said : ‘ i ca n’t say it ’s wrong for the players to go straight to their box after they win the match because i understand the need to share this beautiful moment and victory with your closest ones			2
’ other names proposed for the gate on @entity105 included ‘ @entity106 ’ and ‘ @entity107 ’			0
though one suggested the more poetic ‘ @entity109 ’			0
a @entity9 spokesman said : ‘ it ’s just to make it easier for them			0
it was installed in time for this year ’s @entity114 to make it easier for players to access their team			2

officials fitted a gate so players have to walk up steps to competitors ' box
move expected to stop impromptu celebration started by @entity1 in 1987
