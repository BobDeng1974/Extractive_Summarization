a report by the @entity1 has said more than 1,000 adults and children were trafficked into or within the @entity4 in 2011/2012 a teenage girl was raped 90 times in one weekend it has been revealed , in a shocking report into modern - day slavery in the @entity4			1
the report , due to be published tomorrow by the @entity1 , contains evidence from the girl , who was 16 at the time she was taken into slavery and raped by 90 men			1
the girl , who gave evidence to the committee despite still being ' deeply traumatised ' by the attacks , did not come from a background which put her at risk , but became enslaved after befriending girls vulnerable to abuse , it has been reported			1
@entity23 , chairman of the working group that produced the report , would only tell the committee the girl ' is now safe ' when asked what had happened to her since the attacks , according to the @entity29			1
the report claims efforts to tackle modern slavery in the @entity4 , including the sexual exploitation of children , are in a state of crisis			1
the @entity1 , an independent think - tank set up by @entity37 , has attacked the government for its ' inadequate response ' to the issue after the investigation uncovered a ' shocking underworld ' of human trafficking			1
its study found more than 1,000 adults and children were trafficked into or within the @entity4 in 2011/2012 , but the figure could be ' only the tip of the iceberg '			1
among the cases were @entity4 and foreign victims who had been forced into the sex trade , a life of crime or domestic labour			2
@entity4 girls trafficked within @entity4 for the sex trade made up nearly one half of all @entity4 slavery victims in the latest set of figures			1
@entity60 , managing director of the @entity1 , said : ' our research has uncovered a shocking underworld in which children and adults , many of them @entity4 citizens , have been forced into lives of utter degradation			1
' yet the authorities are either failing to understand the nature of this abuse or turning a blind eye to its existence			2
our once great nation of abolitionists is a shameful shadow of its former self			2
' the think - tank is campaigning for a radical overhaul of measures to combat 21st century slavery , including bringing all human trafficking and modern slavery offences together			2
the report is to be published by the independent think - tank the @entity1 , which was set up by @entity37 it added that victims should be encouraged to come forward without the threat of facing prosecution over immigration breaches or crimes they have committed since being trafficked			1
more training is also needed to ensure police officers , immigration officials and social workers recognise the scale and nature of the problem			0
nine @entity100 men were jailed last year for between four and 19 years for grooming young white girls in and around the town of @entity103			0
the men picked them up from the school gates and took them to houses and flats to be plied with alcohol and drugs before being passed around for sex			0
forty - seven children were identified as victims of the exploitation that left many of their lives in tatters			2
the victims were vulnerable teenagers from deprived , dysfunctional backgrounds who were targeted in ' honeypot locations ' where young people regularly congregated , such as takeaway food shops			0
all the girls were coerced and bribed into keeping quiet about the abuse through a combination of free alcohol and drugs , food , small sums of money and other gifts			0
although some of the victims willingly had sex with their abusers , others were physically assaulted and raped by as many as five men at a time			0
mr @entity60 said : ' we have been alarmed to learn that @entity4 children being trafficked within the country are often viewed as somehow being complicit in their exploitation			1
this is absurd and unacceptable			0
' elements of control in these cases can be subtle and difficult to identify ; this control frequently takes the form of sexual and other forms of violence , physical or emotional abuse , threats of violence towards family members or threats of public shaming			0
' a spokeswoman for the @entity157 said the government has already made significant progress in fighting trafficking			0
she said : ' human trafficking is abhorrent and the @entity158 is committed to combating this crime in all its forms			0
' investment in training for front line professionals to identify and refer victims , improvements in data collection , work with the private sector to protect workers and more personalised care and support for victims are already making a real difference			0
' but the government is not complacent and we will continue to work to improve and strengthen our approach to keep pace with emerging threats			0
