after decades of waiting for the fight the whole world wants to see , it now seems that @entity3 versus @entity4 could happen twice in one year			1
@entity5 , the @entity4 ’s promoter , is convinced that the two greatest pound - for - pound boxers on the planet will finally get it on in 2015			1
@entity5 also believes that the carrot of a double - your - money re-match a few months later will clinch at last a deal which has proved more elusive than the @entity12			1
the removal of two long - standing obstacles which have prevented @entity3 and @entity4 getting into the same ring together has encouraged @entity5 to go public in @entity28			1
the major pay - per - view tv rivals in the @entity28 - @entity30 who screen @entity4 ’s fights and @entity33 who have @entity3 under contract – are understood to be willing to share the massive financial pot via a joint - broadcasting contract			1
@entity5 says : ‘ both networks want this to happen			1
all signs seem to point to a first fight early next year , ’ then the departure of @entity43 from his post as chief executive at @entity47 promotions , who organise @entity3 ’s promotions , has led to a thaw in the long - running feud between that company and @entity5 ’s @entity54 corporation			1
@entity5 envisages that shift in positions making the two - fight deal negotiable			1
he says : ‘ a second fight in the autumn would provide a different cash split because the winner of the first would claim the higher percentage			0
as each of them believes he would win , that provides an extra incentive			0
’ pitching the idea : @entity4 , throwing the ceremonial first pitch in @entity69 , could be willing to agree to a series of demands in order to fight @entity3 since the @entity4 has agreed already to the @entity76 man ’s demands for @entity78 - standard drugs testing and a bigger percentage of the purse for a first fight , it would seem that only @entity3 ’s concern for his unbeaten record remains to be over-come			1
and the biggest hint yet that he is ready to meet that challenge has come with him hinting at ‘ a big surprise when i announce my next fight			2
’ actually , since he meets @entity88 in a rematch in @entity90 on saturday week , he means his fight after next			0
that is planned in @entity93 for may , which is good timing also for @entity4 who fights @entity95 in @entity96 this november			2
always assuming , of course , that both the main men successfully defend their world welterweight titles			0
after that , time will begin running out for them to plunder the riches on offer right now			0
on the road : @entity4 ( right ) and @entity15 are currently on tour to promote their bout in november both @entity3 and @entity4 are in their mid- 30s and @entity5 reminds them : ‘ there is a sell - by date after which …			1
. who cares ? ’ although the public appetite for them to meet remains ravenous , there are signs on social media of fans growing tired of all the excuses and delays			0
not that @entity3 and @entity4 spending next year exclusively fighting each other would be the best of news for @entity127 ’s own @entity126 , who is hoping to cash in against one or other of them in 2015			1
if boxing ’s version of the no 10 bus materialises – you stand there all day , then two come along together – @entity126 will still be left waiting at the stop			0
@entity135 : in another sign that @entity3 is getting ready to bank his heftiest pay - cheques ever , he has been chilling out with @entity28 billionaire @entity139			1
the aging mega-investor even changed into boxing kit at @entity3 ’s gym in @entity90 , where he gave the man called money tips on how to make even more money from all the money he banks from boxing			2
‘ he ’s cool , ’ said @entity3 of @entity149			2
he ’s also very , very shrewd			0
common sense prevails for fury @entity151 , who erupted angrily when first charged with bringing boxing into disrepute , is said to be ready now to attend next wednesday ’s inquiry into his foul - mouthed outburst at a press conference			1
@entity151 threatened initially to boycott the hearing but @entity158 , general secretary of the @entity159 , says : ‘ we understand @entity151 will come to explain and defend himself			0
’ eliminator : @entity151 ( right ) is set to face @entity163 at the @entity164 in november that appearance , i understand , will ensure that @entity151 ’s world heavyweight title final eliminator against @entity163 goes ahead as re-scheduled on november 22 at @entity168 ’s @entity164			0
common sense appears to be prevailing			0
not least because the potential prize of a championship challenge to @entity172 is too big for @entity151 to refuse to accept a reasoned punishment – perhaps a fine and a caution - if found guilty			2
nor – after being marooned for so long by the withdrawals of @entity175 ( twice ) then @entity163 and consequently relegated from a world heavyweight top 10 – can he remain inactive any longer			0
@entity178 looking to sink @entity179 in @entity181 struggle @entity183 belter : @entity178 will look to beat @entity179 again and retain his title @entity185 is presiding over the biggest fight in @entity183 since the @entity187 himself was in his exciting prime and filling the old @entity190 to its rocking rafters			1
@entity178 , @entity185 ’s protegee , will fight this saturday night before an even bigger crowd , in a yet more dramatic venue			2
more than 16,000 will pack a temporary arena constructed in the @entity197 , the dramatic commercial renovation of the shipyard site from which the doomed liner was launched			0
like his promoter and mentor , who famously dethroned featherweight knigs @entity204 in the warm @entity168 summer of 1985 , the impressive and undefeated @entity178 is hoping to bring a world title to @entity206			2
since he has beaten @entity207 super-bantamweight champion @entity179 once already , @entity178 is firm favourite to realise that ambition			1
the @entity210 regrouped after that stoppage , in @entity183 , to claim his belt in convincing fashion			0
but with a fervent @entity217 crowd anticipating even bigger nights in @entity183 – against @entity127 rival @entity219 , @entity221 and perhaps , eventually , @entity215 ’s super-bantam king @entity214 – expect @entity222 to be a howling success this weekend			0
* @entity224 will be televised live on @entity225 on saturday night .			0

promoter @entity5 is convinced mega fight will finally happen in 2015
a double - your - money re-match could happen later in the year
@entity3 and @entity4 have *avoided* a fight for years
@entity151 is ready to attend inquiry into his foul - mouthed rant
@entity178 will fight @entity179 in front of 16,000 people in @entity183
