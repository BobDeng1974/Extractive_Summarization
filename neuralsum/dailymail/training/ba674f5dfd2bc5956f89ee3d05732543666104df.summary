@entity0 has revealed that @entity1 has been offered a ' wonderful deal ' to remain at @entity3			1
but the @entity4 international has yet to agree terms after talks stalled for a number of months and @entity0 said the club would not be held to ransom over his future			1
@entity13 's @entity12 and @entity14 , who have been following the negotiations closely , answer all the burning questions on the @entity1 situation			2
@entity1 's contract negotiations at @entity3 continue to drag on , despite the club offering the @entity4 international a ' wonderful deal ' in the words of manager @entity0 @entity22 stay at @entity3 or move to pastures new ? @entity12 : my gut feeling is that he 'll sign a new contract at @entity3			1
despite the long - winded contract talks , there 's certainly a willingness from @entity1 to stay			1
he 's enjoying his football and enjoys being a key first - team member			0
there 's no guarantees of that anywhere else			0
but it 's also key to remember that @entity1 , having tasted it for the first time this season , is keen to continue playing in the @entity39			2
it 's viewed as a key part in his overall development as a player			0
how long will he accept being out of @entity47 's premier club competition ? sterling in action during saturday 's @entity51 derby draw with @entity52 at @entity53 @entity14 : the first thing to point out is that @entity1 is happy at @entity3			1
he has become an important member of the team and has thrived under @entity0 ' guidance			2
@entity1 has also given no indication that he wants to leave			2
plenty of clubs would want to sign one of the top young players in @entity47 but @entity3 have absolutely no appetite to sell			1
there is no prospect of him moving anywhere soon			0
@entity3 manager @entity0 is keen to tie @entity1 down to a long - term deal at the club why are these contract negotiations taking this amount of time ? @entity12 : contract negotiations for top players are always long , drawn - out affairs			1
look at @entity78 , for example			0
talks over a new contract at @entity82 started months before @entity1 's and there 's still no confirmation of his commitment			1
@entity0 has identified @entity1 as one of the premier young players in @entity47			1
@entity1 's advisors are only right to bide their time over ensuring they secure the best possible deal for their client			2
@entity1 celebrates after scoring in @entity3 's 5 - 1 thrashing of @entity95 at @entity96 last season @entity14 : @entity3 have put together a package that @entity0 described as a ' wonderful deal '			1
it will see his wages go from their current £ 35,000 per week basic to , with incentives and bonuses , a figure that could get close to £ 100,000 per week			1
@entity1 's advisors are playing hard and are looking to secure the absolute maximum for their client			2
at the moment they have reached deadlock			0
@entity1 is set for a bright future for both club and country - he is a central part of @entity113 's plans are @entity3 fans getting frustrated ? @entity12 : probably			1
it 's the uncertainty that will keep them agitated			0
@entity3 fans , traditionally , are n't used to losing their top players			0
in @entity1 they are faced with that very prospect			0
the landscape of @entity122 and @entity123 football has changed , however , as @entity3 are no longer the pinnacle			2
other clubs are now viewed as being more prestigious			0
@entity0 and @entity1 embrace on the touchline during @entity3 's win at @entity130 last season @entity14 : yes , they want the situation sorted out - that much was obvious from @entity135 's comments ahead of the @entity51 derby - but they are more frustrated with the stories that have come out			1
the noise around the situation needs to be turned down			0
there is no sense , though , that they are frustrated with @entity1 as individual			0
he is not the one doing the negotiating			0
sterling cracks a smile in training at @entity148 last week as @entity3 prepared for the derby with @entity52 what are @entity1 's alternatives to anfield if negotiations fall down ? @entity12 : in short , the elite of @entity123 football			1
there 'll be no shortage of high - profile takers should @entity1 's time at @entity96 come to an end			2
@entity159 , @entity160 and @entity161 are monitoring the situation closely			0
@entity13 understands that @entity163 and @entity82 have sat up and taken notice of the contract impasse			0
@entity1 celebrates scoring in @entity3 's @entity166 win over @entity167 last week @entity14 : that question is hypothetical at the minute			1
@entity3 are not looking to sell the player , @entity1 does not want to leave and there are still another four months of the season remaining , so where would he go at this moment ? of course plenty of clubs would be interested in signing @entity1 but would @entity3 do business with one of their rivals in the @entity179 ? that would be highly unlikely			1
would a move abroad suit him at just 20 years of age ? again that is open to debate .			0

@entity1 is yet to sign a new long - term contract with @entity3
@entity0 said he has been offered a ' wonderful deal ' to stay
but his representatives are keen to get the best deal for the young star
his wages are expected to rise from around £ 35,000 - a - week to £ 100,000
a number of @entity123 clubs are monitoring the talks closely
