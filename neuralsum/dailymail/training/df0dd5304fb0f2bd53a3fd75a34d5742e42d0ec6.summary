it was a good thing , too , because getting through it might have been tougher than sprinting away from a linebacker or tossing a touchdown pass for @entity11 's understated star			1
the junior quarterback became the @entity14 ' first @entity5 winner going away saturday night , capping a three - year climb to college football 's most prestigious individual award			1

the @entity5 is the highest individual prize award in college football kiss : @entity1 , pictured at his trophy presentation ceremony at the @entity27 on saturday , is the first @entity11 player and @entity29 to win the award emotional : the quarterback teared up as he thanked his family for supporting his football ambitions in his acceptance speech on saturday @entity1 is n't a bigger talker , but he steadily worked through his speech , thanking his teammates , teachers , friends and his home state of @entity41			1
he finally hit a snag when it came time to thank his mother and father			0
he needed to take two deep breaths and still he got choked up			0
' i had to give thanks to so many people because where i am today , it 's all do to all those people , ' @entity1 said later			2
' it 's hard not to get emotional			0
it 's been a long journey			0
my emotions got the best of me			0
' a pinpoint passer with wide - receiver speed , @entity1 came into this season as the favorite to win the 80th @entity5 and delivered a performance that turned the presentation ceremony at a theater in @entity65 into a foregone conclusion			1
@entity1 had twice as many points ( 2,534 ) as second - place finisher @entity69 ( 1,250 ) , the record - breaking running back from @entity71			1
the other finalist , @entity73 receiver @entity72 , was third			0
top spot : @entity1 ( right ) was up against finalist @entity69 ( left ) , running back for the @entity76 , and @entity72 ( center ) , a @entity79 receiver @entity1 received the second - highest percentage of possible points ( 90.92 ) in @entity5 history , behind only @entity84 quarterback @entity83 , who had 91.63 in 2006			1

pictured above in @entity113 's september 6 , 2014 game against @entity115 snap : number 8 @entity1 throws a pass as @entity118 of the @entity119 goes in for the tackle during the first half of the @entity122 at @entity123 on december 5 , 2014 in @entity124 , @entity86 in an era when so many @entity5 winners seemingly come from out of nowhere — the last two were the first freshmen winners — @entity1 's rise was slow and steady			2
three of the last four @entity5 winners were in their first seasons as starters , including @entity133 , who won the award in his only season at @entity136 after transferring from a junior college			2
before @entity133 , three straight sophomores won the award ( @entity140 of @entity141 , @entity142 of @entity143 and @entity144 of @entity73 )			0
@entity140 was the first sophomore winner			0
like @entity147 quarterback @entity146 and @entity104 , the previous two winners , @entity1 started as a redshirt freshman			2
it quickly established himself as a star , but unlike @entity146 and @entity152 , @entity1 was n't the face of college football in his first season			1
in his second season he put up numbers that rivaled those of @entity5 finalist quarterbacks @entity104 , @entity146 , @entity160 and @entity161 , but when it came time to vote for the @entity5 , @entity1 was forgotten			2
he did n't even finish in the top 10 in 2013			0
this season @entity164 would not be ignored			0
he leads the nation in passer rating ( 186.2 ) , is fifth in total offense ( 342.5 yards per game ) and has led the @entity14 to a @entity91 title with a chance to play for their first national championship			0
of course , patience and poise have defined @entity1 's career			2
he did n't start for his high school team until he was a senior — then led @entity177 in @entity178 to a state title			0
@entity180 shot : @entity1 greets fans outside the @entity183 theater in @entity184 on saturday , after he was named this year 's @entity5 winner a quiet leader with a nice - guy reputation , @entity1 brought no off - field baggage to this @entity5 ceremony			1
after a season beset by off - field troubles , including a school hearing into sexual assault allegations , @entity104 was n't a finalist this time around			2
@entity11 's only @entity5 finalists before @entity1 were quarterback @entity196 in 2001 and running back @entity197 in 2010			1
' if you have your punch list of things as a program , the most iconic individual award would be the @entity5			2
but like @entity1 said , i know he 'd trade all that to win as a team , ' @entity11 coach @entity204 said			1
for @entity196 , @entity113 , with @entity209 's help , put up a billboard in @entity65 to promote their @entity5 candidate			0
@entity11 did n't need a billboard to get the word out about @entity1			1
his play provided all the publicity he needed			0
