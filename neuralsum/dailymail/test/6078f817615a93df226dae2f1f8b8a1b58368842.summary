decided ? @entity1 @entity0 has spoken - and acted - in a way which suggests her strong supporting for legalizing same sex marriage @entity0 has already made up her mind about gay marriage , a report has claimed , ahead of a landmark @entity1 hearing which could legalize the practice nationwide			1
the famously liberal justice , who is 82 , will be part of a decision which begins hearing arguments tomorrow on whether states are allowed to ban same - sex unions and refuse to recognize those made in other states			1
@entity0 , who has sat on the court since 1993 , has been unusually open about her opinions ahead of the cases			0
cutting against a long - held tradition of not speaking out in advance			0
the new report , @entity24 , cited interviews in which @entity0 has referred to the @entity27 public becoming more accepting of gay rights in general - and has even officiated at same - sex ceremonies			1
ahead of the first such ceremony , held in @entity31 , in august 2013 , she told the @entity32 that she understood the symbolic implications of her involvement			2
she said the wedding , of her friend @entity36 , president of the @entity37 , to economist @entity38 , would ' be one more statement that people who love each other and want to live together should be able to enjoy the blessings and the strife in the marriage relationship			0
' she will get the chance to make her views known in the upcoming case of @entity48 , for which arguments will be heard from tuesday and a decision is expected this summer			1
the case is being brought by @entity53 , an @entity54 man who married his husband in @entity56 but was not allowed to name himself as spouse on his husband 's death certificate in his home state			2
currently 37 states allow gay marriage , as well as @entity31 - but @entity54 is one of 13 which has held out			0
protests : pictured are gay rights protesters camped out in front of the @entity1 this weekend			1
@entity53 v. @entity48 will be heard from tomorrow votes : @entity0 is one of four liberal - voting @entity1 justices , though @entity69 ( front row , second from right ) has often sided with them on gay rights issues			1
pictured above are all the @entity1 justices			0
on the front row ( left to right ) are @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity38 , @entity69 and @entity0			2
behind them ( also left to right ) are @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 and @entity81 the @entity1 will determine whether the @entity82 guarantees all citizens the right to same sex marriage , which could void all the remaining bans			0
and if it determines that recognizing gay marriage is still up to individual states , the court could also decide that states are obliged to recognize gay marriage performed elsewhere in the @entity27 after a 2012 ruling , the federal government is already required to recognize gay marriage in states where they are allowed			1
the liberal wing 's four justices are expected to vote in favor of gay marriage , and could be joined by the more conservative @entity69 , who has often sided with liberals on issues of personal freedom , which would provide the five votes necessary for a majority			1
in an interview with @entity108 earlier this year , @entity0 insisted that ' it would not take a large adjustment ' for @entity27 to accept gay marriage across the board , and that the country has become far more accepting			0
gay marriage opponents have said that @entity116 previous actions and public statements go so far as to make her unfit to hear the case			0
battle : the case was prompted by @entity53 , left , who wants the state of @entity54 to recognize him as his husband 's spouse on his death certificate			2
he is taking on @entity125 , right , who leads @entity54 's department of health couple : @entity53 , left , married his husband @entity128 in @entity56 shortly before his death - but has not been allowed to name himself as @entity128 's spouse on his death certificate both the @entity131 and the @entity132 , which oppose gay marriage , have demanded that @entity0 remove herself from the case because she officiated over the ceremony			1
they made the same demand of justice @entity81 , another liberal justice , who has officiated a ceremony as well			0
if both justices were to agree it would leave the court two liberals down and unlikely to side with the legalization			0
however , according to legal scholars , neither has done anything wrong because the earlier court decision had already vindicated same - sex marriages in states which had legalized them			1
it has been speculated that @entity69 could be the swing vote in this issue			0
a recent report by the @entity155 speculated that his professional links with a @entity159 law school dean who hired him in the 1950s could have embedded some early sympathies			0
the report , citing people who knew him when he taught at @entity163 in @entity164 , said that being mentored by @entity166 , who never married and was widely thought to gay , could swing him towards favoring gay rights			2
@entity69 is likely , the report said , to eventually write the @entity1 decision in @entity53 v. @entity48 , which would follow several other written opinions expanding gay rights .			1

@entity175 champion , 82 , has spoken widely about gay rights
she even officiated at a same - sex ceremony in august 2013
opponents have said it makes her unfit to rule on upcoming case
@entity53 v. @entity48 will be heard by nation 's top court from this week
case will decide whether all states have to allow gay marriages
even if not , could be forced to recognize gay marriages in other states
@entity0 is in liberal minority in the @entity1
but conservative @entity69 often votes in favor of gay rights
