by @entity0 published : 09:52 est , 29 june 2012 updated : 12:02 est , 29 june 2012 a long - running dispute between two brothers over conifers erupted in violence when one of the warring siblings hit the other in the face with a small potted tredd			1
@entity10 , 68 , would not even speak with younger brother @entity11 , 64 , but one day when he spied him planting trees on communal land near his manor house he snapped			1
the wealthy retired sales executive picked up one of the juvenile saplings and hit his brother in the face - causing a split lip , cut to his ear and another between his eyebrows			2
the squabbling siblings live opposite each other in two beautiful homes in the picturesque @entity25 , near @entity26			1
@entity27 stands outside his home ( right ) next to the trees which he planted			1
his brother , @entity30 , lives in the house to the left @entity30 bought the manor home and coach house in 2003 , converting the main building into three separate dwellings and sold the other property to @entity11			1
however they fell out over a series of family issues , including the will of their mother , who died in 2004			1
the warring pair do not speak despite sharing the same driveway , eventually came to blows on november 19 , 2011			1
@entity26 @entity47 heard @entity10 had been in a long - running dispute about the trees with his brother @entity11 , who lives in a cottage opposite the manor			1
@entity27 moments after he claims he was hit by his brother @entity11 , a retired businessman and property developer , admitted he had not discussed his planting plans with @entity30 over fears he would become ' confrontational '			1
@entity30 was angry about the trees because he claimed it would restrict access to his drive for his tractor and trailer			1
@entity62 was told that @entity10 had discovered @entity11 had been consulting residents of the manor estate about the trees - without notifying him			1
@entity11 told the court his brother approached him when he was planting the trees , picked one up and hit him in the face with it			1
he claimed the tree had a stake in the bottom of it which split his lip and he also suffered a cut to his ear and between his eyebrows			2
hedge dispute : @entity10 's house @entity25 is pictured on the left , while his brother @entity11 lives in the house to the right @entity25 , and in the foreground the trees which his @entity11 planted and are at the centre of the dispute picturesque : @entity25 , home to @entity10 , in @entity26 , @entity86 but @entity30 denied the allegation and said he had picked up a tree and thrown it in his brother ’s direction , but it did not hit him			1
he said @entity11 , who lives with wife @entity92 , 63 , rugby tackled him to the ground and the injuries were caused by gravel as they grappled on the floor			1
the pair were eventually pulled apart by a neighbour with both later reporting the incident to the police			2
@entity27 stands outside his home			2
the squabbling siblings live opposite each other @entity30 was arrested and refused to accept a police caution with the case going to @entity62 who found him guilty of assault			1
he was handed a six - month conditional discharge and ordered to pay £ 300 costs			2
speaking at their beautiful countryside homes in @entity86 , the two feuding brothers continued their war of words			1
@entity11 said his ' ignorant ' brother ' thrust ' him in the face with one of the trees			1
he said : ' i wanted to tidy up the area and asked the community chairman if i could plant the trees			1
i did it for everyone ’s benefit			2
' then , as i was doing it i looked around and i had the tree thrust in my face , putting me on the ground			2
i know how to defend myself so i kicked his legs away and he came down to my height and we were on the floor			2
' i restrained him which is n’t easy when you have a lung infection and a neighbour helped me up			2
i had a cut lip , cut ear and broke my watch			2
' i called the police and they arrived two hours later			2
the @entity142 got involved because he refused to take the caution			0
he should have put his hands up and said he lost his rag			0
' it is so sad at his age , he could have easily had a word about it but he did n’t			0
he ’s so ignorant and everyone in the community keeps the same view			0
' but @entity30 firmly stood by his defence , describing the case as a ' serious miscarriage of justice ' and claiming locals have ganged up on him and wife @entity159 , 67 , trying to force them out			0
he denies hitting him with the tree , instead saying he threw a tree towards his brother with @entity11 then charging at him before they ' grappled ' on the floor			1
@entity30 also claims @entity11 suffered the injuries as they rolled around the floor like two schoolchildren in a playground			1
he also branded @entity170 ' a liar ' and regrets selling the coach house to his brother in the first place			0
however , he received a six - month conditional discharge and ordered to pay £ 300 costs after being found guilty of assault by magistrates in @entity26 , @entity86			1
furious at the verdict , @entity30 said : ' what they were saying in court is not what was said in their witness statements			0
i did n’t hit him			0
i ’ve never laid a finger on anybody			0
my brother is a liar			0
' his statements to police and as a witness contradicted each other			0
on the stand he said he had difficulty bending down but he managed to build a low brick wall			0
' for me , my whole life has been about honour and trust and as a salesman i used to agree £ 12 million deals all around the world with the shake of a hand			0
' we had a barrister for the case and he was fuming when the magistrate found me guilty			1
this is a terrible miscarriage of justice			0
' @entity30 ’s wife @entity159 added : ' this has caused us a great sense of wrong and injustice			0
@entity30 has never hit me or the children and i can not believe he would harm anyone other than in self - defence			0
' @entity11 says he feels intimidated and unable to move freely around @entity25 following the so - called assault			1
@entity11 is not the only one to feel intimidated			1
we have been thoroughly hurt by the whole incident			0
' a police officer made the comment to my daughter that perhaps the boys should have their heads knocked together			0
it should have been left at that			0
' @entity30 , who has now installed @entity231 at his property in case any further incidents happen , claimed his brother had got everyone in the area on his side to force him out			0
he added : ' they have poisoned us and they all find this very funny			0
it would be great if everyone got on but the community is now an area of distrust			0
we ’ve been very hurt by this			0
' both brothers have admitted they wo n’t resolve their differences and continue to avoid each other despite sharing the same driveway			0
@entity11 added : ' he is above his station			1
he thinks he is the @entity254			0
if i was in his position i would leave as i could n’t live with people not liking me			2
i just wish he would sell up and move			0

@entity10 , 68 , snapped when he *spotted* @entity11 , 64 , planting trees
he was found guilty of assault by magistrates in @entity26 , @entity86
