@entity1 ’s rise to prominence has been as rapid as it has been remarkable			1
on tuesday , the 20 - year - old is expected to start for @entity4 against @entity5 at @entity6			1
the last time the @entity7 met , at @entity8 in august 2013 , the young left back had only 180 competitive minutes of professional football under his belt with @entity12			1
released by @entity14 at the age of 15 for the depressingly familiar crime of being too small , he was forced to rebuild his career in the @entity19 fourth tier as a part - timer with @entity22 - based @entity21			1
the @entity32 ’s fairytale journey even caught the eye of @entity35 captain @entity34			2
the pair ’s paths first crossed two years ago when @entity1 worked evenings dishing out programmes for international games at @entity22 and @entity34 was on a spying trip for @entity42 before they faced the @entity19 in qualification for the @entity44			1
after @entity1 was called up for the first time by @entity46 , @entity34 tweeted a good luck message to the young @entity32 : ‘ @entity50 , stories like yours are inspiring ! wish you all the best ! ’ @entity1 recalls : ‘ i went to plenty of @entity23 games as a kid and then from 16 i worked at @entity22			1
part of my job was to give out programmes in the private lounges before the games			2
it was n’t the worst job in the world as you got into all the matches for free			2
@entity1 worked his way up from the fourth tier of @entity19 football to the @entity68 ‘ i met @entity34 and got my picture taken with him , although i did n’t really speak to him			1
he was massive and i looked pretty small beside him			0
‘ when i got released from @entity14 i was 15 , i had n’t really grown , i was n’t strong enough			1
i knew i had a lot to improve			0
i needed to move on to the next level when i left @entity21 and luckily @entity12 provided me with that chance			0
‘ i knew it was a big leap to go from handing out programmes but i was confident in my ability			0
’ @entity1 ’s form at @entity77 saw him outshine the likes of @entity79 , who won a £ 3million move to @entity81 , in a season of entertaining football that ended in a 2 - 0 @entity85 final defeat by @entity86 in may			1
@entity1 has worked his way up from playing amateur football with @entity21 to the @entity68 former @entity12 man @entity1 was hugely impressive in @entity4 's recent clash against @entity89 @entity12 are producing some major talent			1
@entity92 last season had a £ 600,000 bid accepted for defender @entity94 , but the 18 - year - old decided to stay at @entity77			2
midfielders @entity97 , 22 , and @entity98 , 23 , are also tipped for big things			0
their reputation is largely down to a coach , @entity101 , who ran his own soccer school			0
former @entity12 manager @entity103 made the then - unknown coach the head of @entity12 ’s youth academy at the age of 22			0
@entity101 was fast - tracked into the @entity23 , put in charge of the regional performance school in @entity110 and has gone on to become assistant coach at @entity112			2
@entity113 is the current @entity12 youth director and under 20 coach and , with assistant @entity115 , @entity12 's youth set - up is now the envy of @entity4			0
for @entity1 , @entity4 under 21 recognition soon followed his thrilling appearances for @entity12 and his break came when @entity46 asked a number of young players to help his senior squad prepare to face the @entity124 last october			1
@entity1 impressed @entity46 after being invited to join in a training session with the senior team @entity1 impressed @entity46 in training and with his attitude , and he has started both of @entity4 ’s home @entity131 qualifiers against @entity132 and @entity89			2
at club level , @entity1 has made swapping the @entity19 top flight for the @entity68 look easy after a £ 2.85m move to @entity30			1
‘ he ’s totally and utterly shocked me with his ability to step in , ’ said @entity30 boss @entity136			2
‘ he ’s 20 years old and playing at the highest level and he ’s going to have a big future			0
he ’s a fantastic talent , a humble lad and as quick as i ’ve seen any full back			1
’ @entity1 added to his reputation on friday night when he gave @entity89 duo @entity144 and @entity145 a torrid evening down the left in a vital 1 - 0 win			1
born in 1994 , he harbours only hazy memories of the last time @entity4 reached a major finals			0
‘ my auntie had a big party for the opening game of the @entity153 against @entity154 , ’ he says			0
‘ i remember more about the actual party than the game			0
’ @entity4 duo @entity1 and @entity157 on the @entity6 pitch before their recent game against @entity89 @entity161 : i played @entity4 three times in my career and the games were always fast , furious and aggressive , but i ’ll never forget walking out at @entity22			1
we felt like gladiators heading into the arena — we were waiting for the lions to be unleashed because it felt like we were about to be eaten alive			0
that was the first half of a play - off to reach @entity173 , so it was a massive game			0
@entity175 : you ca n’t call @entity23 v @entity5 games friendlies			1
i had team - mates at @entity179 who i would play with and then against			0
you wanted to kick lumps out of each other , and that is what happened in those days			0
@entity185 was our captain at @entity179 , but ( with @entity5 ) he was against us			2
you want to beat @entity5 and vice versa , that wo n’t change			2
but after the game we went on holiday together ... and are still talking about it to this day .			0
