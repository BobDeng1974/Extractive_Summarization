as the @entity3 pair on death row come to terms with their imminent execution , the @entity1 justice system is being accused of hypocrisy after a local ice manufacturer avoided the death penalty			1
while @entity11 @entity10 and @entity12 are facing the death penalty for attempting to smuggle drugs into @entity11 from @entity15 , local kingpin @entity16 has been given only a jail sentence for a similar crime			1
despite hundreds of pleas for clemency for @entity10 and @entity12 , @entity1 president @entity19 maintains that his hard - line stance against drug dealers will not budge			1
but the story of @entity16 , an @entity1 ice manufacturer who was convicted in 2007 and was handed the death penalty before his appeal - which followed directly after the @entity3 duos ' - won him both a reduced sentence and most importantly , his life , @entity31 reports			1
when @entity12 and @entity10 lodged their final appeal to the @entity48 in @entity49 in 2011 , numbered case 37 and 38 , @entity37 's appeal for life was directly after theirs , numbered 39			1
but while the @entity11 ' judicial review were rejected , in @entity55 's it was decided that the death penalty violated both the @entity1 constitution , the country 's human rights and quoted the @entity60 , according to @entity31			1
his prison sentence was subsequently reduced to 12 years and @entity37 was saved from execution			0
the result presents a stark contrast to the trials endured by @entity12 and @entity10 who are expected to be moved to @entity68 - a prison island off @entity69 - where prisoners on death row are executed			1
@entity10 and @entity12 are expected to be taken to @entity68 , where they will be executed by firing squad despite their proven rehabilitation a general view shows the death island of @entity68 island , upon which @entity1 's maximum security prison is located and prisoners on death row are executed from there they will be given 72 hours ' notice of their execution by firing squad			1
prime minister @entity87 has also called out @entity1 's justice system for its hypocrisy after mr @entity19 offered ' optimum protection ' for over 200 of his citizens who face death sentences overseas - some of them being drug smugglers			1
' i should also just observe today that millions of @entity11 are feeling very , very upset about what may soon happen to two @entity11 in @entity1 , ' mr @entity87 said			2
' my plea even at this late stage is for @entity1 to be as responsive to us as it expects other countries to be to them when they plead for the lives of their citizens on death row overseas			2
' @entity11 has not decided how it would respond to the executions , including whether to withdraw its ambassador , but mr @entity87 told @entity107 newspaper : ' we will find ways of making our displeasure known			2
' @entity1 's @entity111 has confirmed it has invited all embassies with citizens to be executed this month to a meeting on the formalities on monday			1
prime minister @entity87 called out @entity1 's justice system for its hypocrisy after mr @entity19 offered ' optimum protection ' for over 200 of his citizens who face death sentences overseas - some of them being drug smugglers a date for the executions wo n't be provided at the meeting , but the provision of 72 hours notice will be discussed , as well as access to the prisoners for family and logistics over foreign media coverage			1
@entity131 spokesman @entity130 says officials representing @entity133 , @entity134 , the @entity135 and @entity136 have also been summoned			0
when @entity1 executed five foreign nationals last month , the meeting with relevant embassies took place one day before attorney - general @entity141 announced the execution date			0
that announcement signalled the 72 - hour notice period			0
but in this case , the prisoners have to be transferred from jails all over @entity1 to the execution location , nusakambangan island , off @entity69			2
both men have vowed that their time in jail has rehabilitated them and they deserve a reprieve @entity1 police tighten security at the main gate of maximum security prison @entity68 authorities have permission to move @entity12 and @entity10 from @entity15 's @entity162 jail , but have n't set a date			1
foreign minister @entity164 on friday suggested the depth of feeling in @entity11 is so strong that @entity11 may boycott @entity1 if the executions go ahead , but she denied that she was urging for a boycott			2
' i knew that there was very deep concern in the @entity11 public about the likely executions of mr @entity10 and mr @entity12 , and that @entity11 will make their own decisions as to whether they want to travel to a country that does have the death penalty , ' ms @entity164 told @entity177 on saturday			1
death - row prisoner @entity10 's sister @entity179 , left , and his mother @entity178 , right , have been visiting him every day @entity12 mother 's @entity182 arrives to visit her son at @entity185 on thursday boycott calls were growing on social media before ms @entity164 's remarks and politicians have received a flood of letters about the executions			1
ms @entity164 's opposition counterpart @entity193 told the @entity194 she did n't think this was helpful			0
' i 'm really not sure that boycotting @entity15 is going to make much of a difference to the attitude in @entity49 , ' ms @entity193 said			0
@entity12 and @entity10 have been disturbed by the evident preparation for their execution as prison guards broke open the lock to their jail cells to conduct a search			2
artist @entity206 says @entity10 is no longer sleeping as he waits with dread for a final knock on his door to take him to his execution by firing squad			0
mr @entity10 is passionate painter who has been conducting art classes to other inmates while in @entity162 jail			0
the classes have been his way of showing he has rehabilitated in this photo taken on august 17 , 2010 , convicted @entity11 drug smugglers @entity10 ( @entity219 ) and @entity12 ( r ) gesture as they sit inside @entity185 in @entity221 , @entity15 @entity206 said goodbye the 33 - year - old to at @entity185 in @entity15 for the last time on thursday			2
' he knows someone will knock on his door in the middle of the night			0
i offered to bring him valium but he said ' no '			0
he is completely free from drugs and wo n't even take sleeping pills , ' @entity206 told @entity230			0
the @entity11 artist , who in 2011 won the @entity232 , has been @entity10 's mentor since 2012 , helping him develop a talent for painting			0
@entity11 's efforts to stop the executions have so far failed , along with desperate legal bids			0
their @entity239 families are in @entity15 , where they have spent the past three weeks paying daily visits to the men in @entity162 jail			0
over the past decade they 've been imprisoned there , @entity12 and @entity10 have transformed into model inmates , who have helped scores of others rehabilitate and get drug - free			2
officials have been granted permission to transfer the two men from @entity162 jail in @entity15			0

@entity10 and @entity12 could be executed within days
while their pleas for clemency were rejected , an @entity1 meth manufacturer and *supplier* evaded the death penalty

prime minister @entity87 has called out the country 's *double* *standards*
@entity12 and @entity10 are expected to be moved to @entity68 , a prison island off @entity69 known as ' @entity1 's @entity269 '
the men will be given the required 72 hours notice of their executions
