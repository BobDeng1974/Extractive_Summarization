this is the horrifying moment 11 passengers found themselves trapped inside a @entity3 station after striking workers locked up before the last train dropped them off			1
the commuters were locked inside @entity2 in freezing conditions for almost an hour until a station employee returned to free them at 1am on thursday morning			1
passengers called out for help after getting off a @entity12 train at around midnight to discover the gates had been closed and locked			1
passengers called out for help after getting off a @entity12 train at around midnight to discover the gates had been closed and locked some of the passengers stranded at @entity2 were forced to climb over barbed railings to escape the station , which provides mainline train services as well as @entity22 underground connections , closed earlier than usual at 11pm due to the strikes			1
@entity24 , 22 , said : ' the tunnel that goes under the mainline tracks and onto the station concourse had been shut off and padlocked at the point where it joins the underground passageway			0
' from there we could see that the exits at the front of the building had also been shut off , and we tried calling out and rattling the gate to get the attention of tube staff but nobody came			0
' on realising they were stuck , passengers called @entity41 , who told them that an officer would be sent but could take up to 90 minutes			1
taking matters into their own hands one passenger hopped the fence and scavenged car parts from a nearby garage to build a makeshift ladder to help six of the ten other passengers get out			1
mr @entity24 added : ' one person managed to climb over the railing on the @entity55 platform of the mainline station , and came round to the front to shout through the gates to inform us of an escape route			1
' we were all weary , freezing , and angry that we would have to wait 30 minutes or more for help			0
' the first person had to resort to parts of cars found near the car repair company based in the dark and dinghy service road adjacent to the station , to give the six other people daring enough to scale the fence a stepladder to get over			1
' once over the railing , they found themselves atop large commercial waste bins with flimsy lids that were six feet off the ground , but thankfully they all managed to get over safely			0
' a dozen passengers were trapped for almost an hour at @entity2 in north west @entity3 on thursday morning the 48 - hour @entity3 strike ended yesterday evening but many still reported disruption across the network			1
during the 48 hour strike there was no service on the @entity87 or @entity88 lines			1
the @entity90 and @entity91 lines did n't operate through central @entity3 but services continued through some outlying stations			2
the jubilee and @entity96 lines continued operating trains every five minutes throughout the strike but over a reduced distance			0
@entity101 and @entity22 lines operated a severely reduced service with some station closures and trains ran on the whole of the @entity106 but 17 stations were closed			0
when contacted today , @entity108 ( @entity108 ) claimed the mistake was nothing to do with them and was instead the fault of @entity12 for dropping off the customers			2
@entity12 ' operations director @entity114 said : ' we are incredibly sorry that our passengers were affected in this way , particularly on a day when travel in @entity3 was significantly disrupted			1
passengers called out for help after getting off a @entity12 train from at around midnight to discover the gates had been closed and locked ' we are unique in that over half our stations in @entity3 are owned and staffed by @entity3			1
' serving these stations during a strike is a challenging and complex logistical exercise , as we are dependent on @entity3 for many services including , on part of our route , signalling of trains			1
' despite these challenges , we took the decision to operate our full train service and allow passengers to travel , rather than cancel trains and inconvenience hundreds of customers			0
we had no indication that @entity2 would be locked and , in fact , it had been open the night before with no issue			2
' we hugely regret that our passengers were inconvenienced in this way , and will be reviewing our procedures with @entity3 for future strikes			1
' the reason this happened , however , was a direct consequence of us working hard to ensure we could provide a service to @entity3 owned stations that would otherwise have gone without			2
' a @entity108 spokesman said : ' the @entity12 train dropped them off after the station closed			2
' it was nothing to do with us other than our staff let them out			0
' central line operations director @entity156 said : ' after south ruislip underground station had been closed for the evening , we were made aware that around 15 customers of @entity12 , which also serves the station , had mistakenly got off at the station			0
' we immediately sent a member of staff to open up our gates so that the customers could make their way home			0
' @entity108 had earlier warned that services would still be disrupted after 9pm yesterday , and had urged people not to ' leave it too late to travel '			2
commuters wait to board a limited service @entity172 during the strikes @entity108 said almost three out of four tube stations were open , with services running on nine out of 11 lines , although many commuters were forced to find other ways of getting to work @entity3 services returned to normal this morning after huge delays and disruption caused by the strike over ticket office closures			1
fresh talks will be held today to try to resolve the bitter dispute which sparked the strike			0
the walkout by members of the @entity192 and @entity193 unions officially ended at 9pm last night , but a further 48 - hour stoppage is planned from next tuesday evening if there is no deal at the talks			1
journeys on the capital 's @entity200 bicycle hire scheme were up by 50 per cent for the second day , although wet and windy weather persuaded many people to work from home			0
@entity205 , managing director of @entity3 , who had urged the unions to bring forward the meeting , said he was grateful for the ‘ patience ’ shown by passengers			2
the unions have been urging @entity3 mayor @entity210 to meet them to discuss the closures , which will see the loss of 950 jobs			0
@entity3 said eight of 11 lines were running trains , keeping @entity3 " open for business " , but unions said the company had under - estimated the impact of the 48 - hour walkout @entity3 said more trains ran to more destinations and more stations yesterday than on wednesday , but passengers still faced disruption to tube services , and long queues at bus stations and on roads the mayor has refused to meet the unions unless they call off the industrial action			1
@entity192 leader @entity232 said : ‘ our negotiators are geared up and ready to enter the exploratory talks			0
’ @entity108 said almost three out of four tube stations were open yesterday , with services running on nine out of 11 lines , although trains were not stopping at some stations			2
mr @entity210 said : ‘ i understand how frustrating this has been for many @entity242 and i 'd like to thank them for their patience and stoicism during this completely unnecessary strike			0
@entity192 leader @entity232 has said : ' our negotiators are geared up and ready to enter the exploratory talks ' @entity3 mayor @entity210 has refused to meet the unions unless they call off the industrial action ‘ i am grateful to the @entity3 staff who rejected this pointless action and worked , and to the hundreds of volunteers who are helping passengers through the day			1
‘ i 'm pleased that having failed repeatedly to engage in constructive talks around @entity108 's modernisation plans , the unions have agreed to sit down with @entity108 at @entity256			0
‘ rather than hurting hard - working @entity242 and hard - pressed small businesses , they should have been talking to @entity108 this week			2
that the unions wo n't negotiate until after the strike is over tomorrow says a lot about their failure to engage			0
‘ if , as they claimed yesterday , mr @entity232 and mr @entity265 are happy to embrace modernisation , new technology and change , then what on earth are they doing on strike when these changes do just that and involve no compulsory redundancies ? ’			0
