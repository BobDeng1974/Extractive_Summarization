@entity22 remarks : business secretary @entity1 today used his a speech at the @entity8 conference to talk up the possibility of an alliance with the @entity12 after the next election the conference speech was seen as a naked bid to curry favour with the party grassroots and position him for a leadership challenge			1
he also taunted @entity32 for his ‘ split ’ with @entity34 calling it ‘ enticing ’ for the @entity8			1
and he dismissed @entity3 who want to see deregulation of employment laws as ‘ head bangers ’ and ‘ backwoodsmen ’ who find sacking workers ‘ an aphrodisiac ’			1

they face the enticing prospect of a @entity50 split			1
' i do n’t know what @entity34 and @entity52 got up to in @entity54			1
perhaps a pillow fight got out of control in the dormitories			1
’ pillow talk : the ongoing rivalry between @entity60 mayor @entity34 and prime minister @entity32 gave mr @entity1 reason to predict a @entity50 party split at the next election he then stirred up the controversy surrounding @entity50 chief whip @entity66 ’s rant at a policeman : ‘ i have been told that jokes about social class are not good for the unity of the @entity71			1
but as a mere pleb , i could n’t resist it			0
’ mr @entity1 boasted of blocking @entity3 who wanted to deregulate the workplace , saying : ‘ we have seen off the head bangers who want a hire and fire culture and seem to find sacking people an aphrodisiac			1
’ ' fairer tax in tougher times ' : mr @entity1 vowed to press ahead with plans to for ' the proper taxation of wealth and land ' despite @entity50 objections and he vowed to press ahead with plans to introduce ‘ the proper taxation of wealth and land ’			2
‘ it horrifies the @entity50 backwoodsmen but it is popular and right , ’ he said			2
in a clear signal of where his political heart lies , mr @entity1 praised the virtues of the @entity12 , of which he was a member in the 1970s			2
‘ @entity12 can still be a ruthless political machine but it used to be a lot more than that			2
it once had a soul and new ideas , ’ he said			0
mr @entity1 insisted he still backs the @entity50 plans to rein in the deficit			2
‘ actually it is not a matter of @entity105 versus @entity106 or @entity107 or even @entity16 , ’ he said			0
‘ @entity108 is ok by me			0
‘ i believe we struck the right balance and adopted a deficit reduction plan			0
i make no apology for my continued support for that fiscal discipline			0
’ but he also warned that failure to spark growth would lead to ‘ economic disaster and political oblivion ’			0
mr @entity1 said the @entity8 should ‘ fight the next general election as a totally independent , national , credible challenger for power ’ but made it clear he believes they will remain in government whoever wins the election			1
‘ i do n’t believe tactually that the @entity127 people will want to entrust their future to any one party next time , ’ he said			0
‘ that government must have @entity8 at its heart			0
’ politics : from left , @entity135 politician @entity134 , @entity136 , chief secretary to the treasury , @entity138 , the deputy prime minster , @entity140 , chair of the @entity141 , and @entity1 , business secretary , vote on a policy motion at the @entity8 conference yesterday mr @entity1 also launched an outspoken assault on bankers , accusing them of ‘ greed and stupidity ’			1
‘ our leading banks are often anti-business especially anti-small business			0
they threw traditional relationship banking over the side and sold useless insurance and dodgy derivatives instead			0
‘ public anger at the greed and stupidity in this industry will continue for a long time			0
’ later , in an interview with @entity163 , he again hinted that he would like to be party leader , insisting that at 69 he is not too old			0
‘ i work hard , i ’ve got plenty of energy , i ’ve got good health , i do n’t see my age as being a problem , ’ he said			0
‘ i ’m not bidding for the leadership but whatever job i have , i do n’t see my age as an impediment			0
’ and he even claimed that if the @entity3 will not sanction his plans for a @entity174 on homes worth over £ 2million , he could impose it in coalition with @entity12 instead			1
‘ if we do n’t persuade the @entity50 we will continue to make the case into any future election , of course			1

the business secretary brands @entity3 ' *headbangers* ' and ' backwoodsmen ' who find sacking workers an ' aphrodisiac '
he tells conference *delegates* @entity8 candidates at the next election face the ' enticing prospect of a @entity50 split '
' i do n’t know what @entity34 and @entity52 got up to in @entity54 . perhaps a pillow fight got out of control in the dormitories , ' he jokes
the former @entity12 *advisor* also harks back to the @entity203 era when that party still had a ' soul '
