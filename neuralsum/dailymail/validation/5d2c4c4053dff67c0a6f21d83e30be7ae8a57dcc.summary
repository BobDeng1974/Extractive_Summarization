@entity1 , who bowled the @entity6 out for 182 , therefore remain one of two unbeaten teams in the tournament - co-hosts @entity15 are the other - after scrambling the verdict with 10.5 overs to spare on a typically bouncy pitch at the @entity20			1

@entity32 struggled badly against @entity1 's new - ball pair , eventually edging behind off @entity34 ( three for 35 )			2
@entity21 was out of sorts too , dropped twice and then holing out to a mis - pull off @entity36 - but not before a mix - up with @entity38 saw the @entity6 number three run out for just two			0
captain @entity40 could not halt the slide , aiming an expansive cover - drive to a swinging low full - toss first ball and instead edging on to @entity44			0

@entity76 threatened to shorten the chase until he hooked @entity59 into the hands of @entity38 - and when @entity79 went to a marginal @entity81 verdict , caught - behind off @entity82 , @entity1 had lost four wickets with more than 100 runs still needed			1
@entity85 struggled against the short ball before edging a cut behind off @entity32 's medium - pace , and the same tactic from @entity59 saw @entity52 pull @entity59 to a juggling @entity38			0
but @entity8 engineered an unbroken match - winning half - century stand with @entity92 and finished top - scorer with 45 not out in a curious contest which contained 47 extras			2
