during @entity2 ’s victorious run at the @entity3 two years ago , @entity0 issued a @entity4 that got somewhat overlooked at the time			1
the gifted @entity7 had been knocked out in the second round and was reflecting on the frustration of playing in the era of the then dominant trio of @entity12 , @entity13 and @entity14			1
striking an unusual tone of despair for such a genial and easygoing man , he said : ‘ i work hard every week , i give a lot of myself every day but i never get rewards			0
that ’s why sometimes it ’s tough			0
i ’m not a machine			0
’ barely a week later @entity2 had won his first @entity25 title , and @entity0 ’s words became a measure of his achievement			1
@entity14 , @entity36 : lost 7 - 5 , 6 - 3			2
@entity12 , @entity37 @entity35 : lost 1 - 6 , 6 - 3 , 7 - 5			0
@entity12 , @entity38 : lost 6 - 3 , 6 - 2 , 6 - 1			1
@entity13 , @entity39 : lost 6 - 3 , 7 - 5			0
the mercurial man from @entity41 has carried on since as one of those players — @entity45 @entity44 is another — who at a different time in history would have been good enough to claim one of the sport ’s biggest prizes			0
sometimes this has sapped his motivation , but he arrives for his fourth - round appointment with @entity2 , which begins at around 7:30pm @entity55 time on sunday , at a time when his enthusiasm has been fully rekindled and he is ready for the fight			2
they are trying to reach the quarter - finals , a stage made by @entity62 , who out - slugged @entity63 6 - 4 , 2 - 6 , 6 - 2 on sunday to score a hugely popular win and become one of only four top 10 players left in the women ’s event			1
undone : the @entity55 no 1 has a poor record against players in the top 10 so far in 2014 @entity63 was given a code violation for time wasting and her slow play aggravated the @entity75 , whose career revival continues after her split from @entity78			0
@entity0 underwent a revival of his own when victory earlier this month in the @entity81 got him inspired after a mediocre first half of the season			2
in @entity84 he defeated @entity2 , @entity14 , @entity13 and @entity85 all in the same week			1
the quarter - final against @entity2 was far more competitive than their meeting in @entity89 in late march , when @entity0 was extremely poor			1
he looked to be going through one of his existentialist phases , wondering what the point of it all was			0
battle : @entity2 has dropped two sets so far en route to the fourth round in @entity99 @entity2 , who has slipped to no 9 in the rankings , has pondered the same thing at times , having achieved so much between the @entity104 and @entity105 the following year			1
climbing back up the mountain after back surgery must have seemed a forbidding task , but now he has an excellent chance of ridding himself of the statistic that has dogged him since winning @entity105 — that of not having beaten a top 10 player			2
@entity0 was no 12 when defeated in @entity112 and , in pure ranking terms , that has been his biggest scalp this season			0
the @entity7 is now at @entity117 , although @entity2 is dismissive about the significance of that benchmark			2
threat : @entity0 has won just twice against @entity2 in 11 meetings so far in their career ‘ it ’s better almost not to think about it too much because i ’ve played 500 or 600 matches in my career and you ’re going to have moments when certain things are hard , ’ he said in the wake of his third - round victory			1
‘ there are periods when some players struggle to serve out matches , sometimes it can be struggling to come back from tough situations , sometimes it can be struggling to stay ahead or sort of having ups and downs in matches — you ’re going to go through that in an 800 , 900 - match career			0
’ @entity0 has said he wished he had thought of hiring @entity143 , who will be in @entity2 ’s corner for what will be a 12th encounter between the two			2
@entity2 , whose game can defuse the @entity7 ’s power , usually prevails and he leads their series 9 - 2			1
it is their most important meeting since the @entity105 semi-final of 2012 .			0

@entity2 takes on @entity0 in last *16* in @entity99
@entity155 has struggled through opening week at @entity156
@entity2 could face @entity14 in quarter - final should he beat @entity0
2013 @entity105 champion holds 9 - 2 head - to - head record over @entity7
