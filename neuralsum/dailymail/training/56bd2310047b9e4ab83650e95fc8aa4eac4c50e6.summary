the rare orchid looks as if it is giving a huge grin with outstretched arms , just like the misanthropic ogre who reveals a secret soft side in the beloved film series			1
the flower , called @entity16 or bee orchid , was pictured in @entity18 by @entity20 photographer @entity19			1
doppelganger : this orchid happens to look almost exactly like cartoon character @entity4 the truth : the @entity25 is named for its resemblance to a bumblebee the university lecturer from @entity29 caught sight of the remarkable flower while out walking through the @entity32			1

' this is a very special species of flower , i remember having seen them in my wildflower guidebooks and longed to see one in the flesh , ' he said			0
' when i first saw one i was amazed by how clever their mimicry is and how beautiful the flowers are			0
' despite the bee orchid being very colourful it is extremely difficult to spot because it is tall and thin and grows amongst tall grasses			0
' original : like the orchid , @entity4 boasts green skin , horns , an open mouth and a brown waistcoat @entity19 has also snapped the orchids in the @entity20 - although they are harder to find here			2
