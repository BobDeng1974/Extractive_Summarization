have you paid your credit card bill this month ? an hour in the company of the @entity3 is enough to convince anyone never to buy anything ‘ on tick ’ again			1
you do n’t want @entity7 turning up on the doorstep to take your car away			1
a @entity11 veteran , 37 years old and built like the side of a @entity14 tank , @entity7 has a no - nonsense approach to repossessions			1
in his tow - truck , @entity18 on the drive of a house where finance repayments have n’t been made			1
reaching into a car as the driver pulls up , @entity7 grabs the keys , soaks up a barrage of abuse and then drives off with the vehicle in tow			1
it must feel like being mugged by a grizzly bear			1
grizzly : @entity7 in @entity31 's the @entity3 he does n’t just take cars			1
if the payments are late , @entity7 will take anything — ‘ teeth - whitening machines , stone crushers , walk - in chillers , foot - binding machines , we ’ve done them all , ’ he says			1
this does n’t make him popular			1
@entity41 ca n’t see why — his victims borrowed money , and chose not to repay			1
he once collected a @entity44 from a luxury home , and was told by the indignant family : ‘ we ’ve just come back from a holiday at @entity48 , and now you ’ve ruined it ! ’ and it ’s not as if he uses excessive force			2
‘ people always think i take too much of a hard stance , ’ he protests , ‘ but they have n’t been run over , they have n’t been told : “ we ’re going to kill your kids			2
” ’ he seems to enjoy the rough and tumble of his job , which is handy since some debtors try vigorously to hang on to their goods , using baseball bats , golf clubs , hammers , pickaxe handles and even shotguns			2
in the cab of his tow truck , @entity7 lets off steam : he rants about the number of immigrant faces he saw last time he visited hospital , and the injustice of paying 20 per cent taxes			2
‘ we do n’t live in a civilised country at all , ’ he said bleakly			2
‘ the human race is s * * *			2
’ so it is surprising to watch him caring for his two sons at home , feeding the baby in his high - chair and building @entity87 spaceships with his older boy			2
he clearly dotes on them , and they worship him : ‘ he ’s like no other dad , he ’s always there for me , he ’s just really cool basically , ’ says ten - year - old @entity94			0
and it ’s even more unexpected when @entity7 reveals he has a second job : painting ‘ muriels ’ , as he calls them , on children ’s bedroom walls			0
the grizzly bear is just a big cuddly teddy — but do n’t count on seeing his soft side if he comes for your car			0
the flash red @entity107 of education executive @entity108 might be at risk of repossession in @entity111 , as the school goes through one of its frequent financial sticky patches			1
the new term of this long - running drama was heaving with excitements — drug - taking , death threats , kidney failure and a 14 - year - old having a sex change			0
and that was before break			0
my favourite scene harked back to more innocent days			0
waiting for their @entity129 teacher to turn up in class , the pupils took a breather from peddling pills and realigning their genders , and chucked paper aeroplanes around instead			0
if someone could teach them how to flick ink pellets , this disaffected bunch might actually start to enjoy education			0
not enjoyable : @entity140 stars @entity141 and @entity142 there was nothing to enjoy about @entity140			1
like the sunday night period drama @entity146 , this is a good story concept , ground down into a miserable grey paste			0
the characters are uniformly nasty , the cynicism is depressing and the bedroom scenes are brutal			0
and so much of it was n’t credible			0
why was @entity141 ’s character , ex-minister @entity158 , hanging around internet cafes in a hoodie , looking like a terrorist , when he could have sent his anonymous tweets from a pay - as - you - go mobile phone ? why did he stage his conspiratorial chats right under the chief whip ’s nose ? most of all , after that hideous rape scene before the opening credits , why did n’t @entity142 ’s character crack him over the head with a wine bottle and kick him out of the house ? ‘ we can all do things we ’re not proud of , ’ @entity141 muttered			0
and he said it like he was talking about this whole show .			0
