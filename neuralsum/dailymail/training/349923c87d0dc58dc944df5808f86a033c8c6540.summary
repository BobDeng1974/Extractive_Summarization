teenagers are taking the illicit drug ecstasy from just 15 , with the belief they are completely immune to the dangers of the potentially deadly substance			1
but these drugs seem to be becoming increasingly dangerous , with reports from users online revealing pills are putting people in hospital and inducing psychotic episodes			2
this comes just days after the funeral of @entity16 teenager @entity15 , who died of a suspected drug overdose after taking ' one and a half ' pills at @entity22 music festival earlier this month			1
her family believe it was due to an acute allergic reaction from the drugs			0
@entity31 from @entity32 and @entity36 said there was a concerning trend which saw teenagers were taking ecstasy younger mr @entity31 has been analysing drug trends and working with schools across the country on their substance education programs for many years , also revealed the concerning rates at which young people are consuming pills			1
' i go to schools and i see 15 - year - olds that are popping ecstasy , ' mr @entity31 told @entity50			1
' those young people that do use drugs start earlier and doing it in a more dangerous way than before			1
' if you take the drug away these are very young people who have no life experience and if something goes wrong they have no idea what to do , ' he continued			0
head of the @entity63 drugs squad , detective superintendent @entity61 , agreed telling @entity50 the young age at which people were consuming these drugs set off alarm bells			1
' its concerning that we have the anecdotes and evidence of very young people taking them , ' superintendent @entity61 said			1
however mr @entity31 argued that it was not only the age teenagers were starting to consume the drugs but the way they were consuming them that also raised alarm bells			1
' the thing that concerns me is that i am seeing more and young people who are seeing no risk in ecstasy			2
' he added that teenagers are consuming the drug and completely ignoring the idea that these are potentially deadly substances			1
drug community website @entity89 feature warnings about various dangerous drugs around @entity34 currently , such as these known as @entity92 these claims for experts come just days after ms @entity15 's funeral , held in @entity16 drug community website @entity89 is a forum where users can share information about certain types of pills and warn others about particularly bad batches			1
currently the most recent warning exists for a pill known as @entity92 , which originated in the @entity105 but has made its way to @entity34			0
one user said an imitation of the original tablets from overseas bought in @entity16 meant a ' friend ended up in hospital in a psychotic state off of two ( ecstasy tablets )			0
' do not recommend consumption			0
' this drug user also said the pill left them feeling unwell , unhappy and unable to sleep			0
' started to trip and feel absolutely terrible , an ominous overhanging feeling that can only be described as weird			0
blue pills known as @entity120 or @entity121 have also caused concern with people already hospitalised after using them ' was reduced to sitting down waiting it out , effects lasted pretty far into the next day , felt very unwell and unable to sleep , ' the user recounted			0
a second report on small blue pills known as @entity120 or @entity121 was also visible online , this time originating from the @entity130			0
@entity131 report that some have already been hospitalised after consuming them			0
a similar pill has also been seen in @entity63 , with users issuing a warning as they did not think the substance contained @entity137 - the main ingredient in ecstasy pills			2
despite many places online which allow users to share such information , superintendent @entity61 had one message for them : drugs kill			1
mr @entity31 said ms @entity15 's death was tragic but ultimately came down to bad luck , as drugs affect all people differently ' the bottom line is drugs are illegal and they kill , ' he said			1
he said the death of ms @entity15 plus the overdose of nine others at the festival was tragic , but it reinforced a message he and others had been trying to get across for years			2
' there ’s no such thing as recreational drugs , people do n’t know what they 're getting , they do n’t know how they 're going to react			0
mr @entity31 echoed these sentiments , saying someone could take a certain pill on day and have a positive experience , but take the same one the next week and have a vastly different reaction			2
he added that ms @entity169 's death could not have been predicted although it was unlikely she was the only one who consumed the pills she did			0
superintendent @entity61 warned that drugs were unpredictable , and it was tragic that deaths often brought up these conversations ' i think we 'd have to be extremely naive to think that she was the only person who took the drugs that she took			2
' the reality is with her death like so many of them ... when it boils down to say why , usually you have to turn around and say bad luck			0
' it 's a horrible thing to say but it comes down to luck , ' mr @entity31 said			0
when asked about issuing warnings for particularly dangerous drugs , mr @entity61 said they do that in certain cases such as earlier this year when a pill called @entity191 were making people very ill. however he made clear that the key message was about preventing people from taking any drugs at all and ultimately it would need to come down to social change .			1
