@entity0 have highlighted the class divide in @entity3 football between the fourth tier and top flight with a cheeky @entity7 post on @entity9 's record - smashing £ 5billion tv rights deal			1
the self - described ' club that would n't die ' say that one match in the new deal , worth an average of about £ 10million would cover their most significant outgoings - player wages - for two decades			1
as @entity18 and @entity19 poured a combined £ 5.136bn into the 168 games that will be shown live between 2016 and 2019 , and the headline clubs contemplated what they 'd do with their riches , @entity17 's social media mouthpiece put things into perspective			1
' the @entity26 has a new £ 5bn tv deal			2
1 game would pay our annual wage bill for the next 20 years , ' @entity0 posted on @entity7 on wednesday afternoon			1
@entity32 shoots for @entity0 , whose wage bill could be paid for 20 years with what broadcasters have paid the @entity9 for the tv rights to a single match in the new £ 5bn deal @entity17 take the pitch for a match against @entity40 at their 5,057 - capacity ( 2,000 seated ) @entity43 a cameraman takes in the view of @entity46 's empty 47,405 - capactiy ( all seated ) @entity47 @entity18 took up five of the seven packages on offer for the three seasons from 2016 - 17 , while the other two went to @entity19 as the deal marked a 70 per cent boost on the current deal for the @entity9 , already the world 's richest football competition			1
while @entity58 's 15th - placed club did n't go into exact details of their costings , the more the numbers are crunched on the staggering deal the more clubs down the pecking order 's proverbial jaws will drop			2
@entity19 are forking out £ 7.6m a game for their packages of saturday afternoon games and midweek matches , but @entity18 are paying a whopping £ 11.1m - a - match for their five sets that include a first for friday nights , saturday lunchtimes , two slots on sunday , monday evening , and @entity74			1
if @entity75 claim top spot in 2016 - 17 , as they did last season , they will get around £ 156m from tv rights alone of course , comparisons between @entity0 and world famous @entity80 gave the club international recognition in the 1980s in an advertisement for the @entity85			1
when one kid was disgusted by his friend having a glass of milk , he says : it 's what @entity92 drinks ... he said if i did n't drink lots of milk , when i grow up , i 'll only be good enough to play for @entity0			2
' the milk hater said : ' @entity0 , who are they ? ' ' exactly , ' was the famous response that has now become a catch phrase			0
@entity92 appears at @entity0 with a milk bottle referencing the famous 1980s commercial mocking the club in his role promoting telecommunications company @entity104 as with the milk ad , @entity0 see none of the @entity9 deal that works out at £ 1,887 per second of action shown			1
of course , the clubs do n't see all of this money , but they do get the lion 's share with the bottom club in the 2016 - 17 season when the new deal begins expecting £ 99million from the tv rights , up from £ 62m this season and £ 1.5m more than this year 's top club will get			1
the top club , and the @entity43 faithful may want to look away now , will get around £ 156m for the 2016 - 17 campaign up from £ 97.5m this time around			1
with @entity9 clubs concentrating on building their brands internationally and working out how to best monetise already packed stadiums , @entity0 just want their turnstiles at the @entity127 - with a capacity of 5,057 with 2,000 seated - to be troubled			2
@ @entity0 boasts 20,200 followers which it 's pointed out would fill the @entity43 more than four times over : ' be lovely if even 10 % of you could make it to a game 1 day			2
' @ @entity0 pointed out that their 20,200 @entity7 followers could fill their home ground four times over cricket legend @entity139 is a famous @entity0 fan and among many fan shareholders the club also shows what the simple purchase of a scarf would do for its young players			0
