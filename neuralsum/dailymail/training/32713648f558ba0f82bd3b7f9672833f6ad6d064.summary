it was also rung on september 11 , 2001 after the attacks on the @entity17 in @entity18			0
much loved : once sacked by revolutionaries , @entity8 is a favourite with tourists and its bells mark some of the most solem moments of recent history including @entity26 ' liberation and 9/11 ancient and modern : despite the sci - fi protective gear , the blend of metals to be used is a recipe dating back centuries clamped : the mix for the new bell is shut in place by workers at the royal foundry in @entity5 the foundry worked with the @entity39 of @entity40 to create computer software that would allow the foundry to design a bell as well as hear it			1
the shape of the bell determines how it sounds			2
the idea is to make music from the cathedral sound as it did before the @entity49			0
experts have found manuscripts indicating what note the original bell would have produced			1
restoration : bishops survey the work in progress two centuries after revolutionaries took over @entity8 cathedral eight other bells have also been commissioned for the 850th anniversary of the cathedral			2
after the revolution , the north tower 's bells were replaced in 1856 , but they will replaced again with bells made of better quality metal that will produce a clearer sound			1
some of the bells were taken out of use when it was discovered that ringing them caused the building to shake , threatening its structural integrity			0
the nine new bells will be inaugurated in february 2013 and will sound on @entity77 , a month later .			0
