she 's finally free but her beau is nowhere to be seen mother - to - be looked sombre as she dealt the big day in court all alone @entity4 has been in @entity5 since february by @entity7 reporter published : 15:14 est , 19 april 2013 updated : 16:01 est , 19 april 2013 it 's the day she 's been dreaming of for so , so long			1
finally , a judge was able to undo the mistake that was @entity12 's 72 day marriage to @entity13 after 536 days of bitter negotiations			1
this means the 32 - year - old will be able to give birth to her first child in july without still being married to @entity13 , and therefore should be an extra special time for both her and the baby 's father , beau @entity4			1
so sad : @entity12 should 've been celebrating on friday when she was finally rid of @entity13 , but her beau @entity4 has been in @entity5 since february but on friday , as a sad looking @entity12 dealt with the court date alone , as @entity4 , 35 , was nowhere to be seen			1
he 's in @entity5 , and he has been since fashion week , and while the two have flown back and forth to see one another , it 's baffling many people that they 're spending so much time apart			1
especially when you 'd expect a superstar with a private jet to want to be at his partner 's side for such a big event in their lives			1
a spokesperson for @entity12 has yet to return @entity41 's request for comment			2
@entity12 cut a lonely figure in court and barely raised a smile when a judge granted her divorce			2
' i think this is a reasonable way to resolve this case , ' said @entity52 judge @entity51 , who did not disclose terms of the settlement			0
@entity13 sent his lawyer but did not appear in court			2
together but apart : @entity12 has been based in @entity57 throughout her pregnancy while her boyfriend @entity4 has mostly been in @entity5 since february ' ms. @entity12 , is this your signature ? ' the judge asked her as he perused a three - page settlement agreement			1
' yes , ' she replied			0
she continued to answer yes when asked if she had discussed the matter with her lawyer and understood that there would be no trial			0
' during your marriage did irreconcilable differences occur ? ' the judge asked , ' no ' she replied			0
meanwhile , a spokesperson for @entity13 told @entity72 : @entity13 and his family are excited to move forward and are grateful for all the support they have received in this process			0
" the rep then sets the priorities straight : " his commitment to the @entity80 and the team 's incredible fans is his number one priority and he is excited to head into the playoffs tomorrow with this situation behind him			2
' @entity87 : @entity12 looked lovely in a black shirt dress with pleated skirt as she arrived for her date with destiny sombre : @entity12 was classy enough to wear black and not look too pleased about the whole debacle where the magic happened : @entity12 learned at @entity96 on friday that she 's officially free of @entity13 but a sombre - looking @entity12 acquitted herself well by refusing to revel in getting the verdict she wanted , and looked stunning in a beautiful , suitably black fitted dress			1
it 's been a dirty fight , with each camp going back and forth with tales of betrayal and deceit			2
a source even claimed that @entity13 was the one who persuaded his estranged wife to take the honeymoon trip to the @entity108 in @entity109			0
‘ @entity13 was the one to push for the honeymoon			0
@entity12 did n’t want to go on the honeymoon because they were scheduled to move to @entity115 to begin filming @entity116 @entity115 , ’ a source told @entity111			0
@entity13 was absolutely dumbfounded when a photographer appeared out of nowhere and started taking pics of them by the pool , ’ the source said			0
‘ @entity12 happily posed , and @entity13 realised her camp had arranged it			0
’ respectful : you could 've expected @entity12 to do a little jig but she behaved with impressive decorum stylish : the court date mustered a delightful outfit from @entity12 at her divorce deposition @entity12 confessed that she was against going on the holiday , which @entity13 is allegedly using as part of his case against the 32 - year - old reality star , claiming their marriage was fraud			2
on wednesday @entity12 , who is pregnant with her first child , was seen looking somber as she arrived at a @entity57 studio alone			0
her boyfriend @entity4 meanwhile has been based in @entity5 since @entity140 in february , with @entity12 regularly flying over to visit him			1
it 's over ! @entity12 is finally free of @entity13 after 536 days of dispute over their marriage over before it began : @entity12 and @entity13 called time on their marriage after 72 days but the divorce has taken much , much longer to sort oh @entity12 ! wearing a sexy camisole over jeans is probably one of @entity12 's worst maternity moments another dubious ensemble : @entity12 stepped out for lunch at @entity153 in @entity154 on thursday			1

she 's finally free but her beau is nowhere to be seen
mother - to - be looked sombre as she dealt the big day in court all alone
