@entity1 manager @entity0 has admitted becoming a more ' autocratic ' manager because of the club 's @entity4 campaign			1
@entity0 and @entity1 face a make - or - break encounter with @entity7 on tuesday , which echoes their famous 2004/05 win against @entity10 which took the club through to the knockout stages and on the road to later glory in @entity15			1
the congested fixture list caused by @entity1 's @entity18 games has prevented @entity0 from properly bedding in his nine new summer signings and forced him to change approach after a 3 - 1 defeat against @entity22 on november 22 left the club in 12th place			1
for the following match in @entity38 , which @entity1 drew 2 - 2 to set up the showdown with @entity7 , @entity0 returned to basics by leaving out new signings @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 and @entity45 , and says he 's been far more direct with instructions to his players			1
' i have had a lot less time on the training field this year			2
the problem i have had personally is you ca n’t try things , you ca n’t coach , ' said @entity0			1
' that is alright if i 'd had two years working with the same group and only added a couple of new players			0
but i 've had nine new players and no coaching time			0
' when i first came to @entity1 , i put my principles in place ; this is the way i work			1
' once i was bedded in and people understood , i became a little more democratic , more educational			0
but after @entity22 , i ’m thinking “ right , i need to become autocratic again			2
” ' i 've provided even more clarity , been more concise in the ways of working			0
' ultimately , it ’s about winning and after @entity22 i needed to look because we were nowhere near our level our standard			2
so i had to find the solution to win games			0
' @entity1 new boys @entity43 , @entity44 and @entity75 were left on the bench against @entity38 captain @entity77 ( left ) started on the bench against @entity27 to rest him for the game against @entity35 @entity1 have lost three of their five @entity4 group games so far – two of them to holders @entity33 – but will progress into the last - 16 if they beat @entity7 by a scoreline that will give them a better head - to - head record than the @entity89 side , won their first game 1 - 0			1
the situation is strikingly similar to the @entity10 game which took place exactly 10 years ago on monday and has gone down in @entity95 folklore			0
@entity1 needed to score three goals to progress after @entity99 legend @entity98 had given the @entity101 side a half - time lead			1
but roared on by @entity106 , unsung heroes @entity103 and @entity105 scored for @entity1 before @entity77 scored a stunning “ winner ” after 86 minutes			1
five months later , @entity1 were winning the trophy itself for the fifth time after an incredible comeback against @entity111 and @entity0 hopes the remarkable season can be an omen			1
' it is a tough competition			0
but as we have seen over the years , it is not always the best team that can go on and do well in it , ' said @entity0			2
' our only concentration is to get out of the group			0
if we can do that , we will be better later on			0
' we know what happened against @entity10			0
they went on and won it that year , having just about qualified			0
i am really looking forward to the atmosphere on tuesday night			2
