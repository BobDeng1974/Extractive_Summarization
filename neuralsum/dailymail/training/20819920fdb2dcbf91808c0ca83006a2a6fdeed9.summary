by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 10:36 est , 28 january 2013 updated : 12:34 est , 29 january 2013 plans to allow childminders and nursery staff look after up to six children at once have been branded ' grotesque ' by the government 's own childcare advisors amid warnings that the quality of care could be hit			1
education minister @entity11 unveiled a major overhaul of the rules on who can look after children , the qualifications they need and the ratios of staff to children with the aim of having fewer , better - qualified staff			1
but she came under fire for citing other @entity24 countries which allow nursery workers to look after more children than in @entity27			1
@entity28 , professor of @entity29 at the @entity30 , said : ' the figures she gives seem to me to be rather grotesque			0
each nursery worker will be able to look after four under - two - year - olds , rather than three as now			1
the number of under - fives goes up from four to six			2
childminders will be able to have two babies in their care rather than one , and four under - fives , not three			2
officials point to figures which show that in @entity61 , the @entity62 and @entity63 nursery staff can look after at least six children and in @entity63 up to 12			1
every parent will get help with childcare costs in a massive extension of government funding to cut bills			1
deputy pm @entity71 had initially suggested extra funding would be targetted at low - income families before insisting last week that he was ‘ unambiguously in favour ’ of giving more support to ‘ the @entity27 middle classes ’			2
but today education minister @entity11 went further and promised all working parents would benefit			1
ministers are also finalising plans for £ 1.5billion in tax breaks for working families with young children , expected to be worth at least £ 1,000 a year to help pay for spiralling costs of childcare			1
miss @entity11 told the @entity86 : '' we want to help all families , all families who go into work we want to help with their childcare costs , we ’re absolutely clear about that			1
' details are expected to be announced in the @entity92 in march			0
she was forced to deny the funding package had been watered down			0
' it has n’t fizzled out			0
it is coming , it may be slightly longer in the gestation than would be ideal , but it is coming , ' she told @entity97			0
but professor @entity28 told @entity97 : ' i think that @entity11 simply got the figures wrong about the ratios in other countries			2
she has left out assistants , she has left out the number of children that might be with a childminder at any one time			0
' the figures she gives seem to me to be rather grotesque			0
' professor @entity28 co-wrote a report for the government with professor @entity111 last year which warned relaxing ratios would lead to a ' deterioration ' in the quality of care			1
today professor @entity117 said : ' the ratio relaxation is unlikely to reduce childcare costs , but may well drive down childcare quality			1
' miss @entity11 insisted the choice on how many children are looked after in nurseries should be up to firms and parents			1
' at the moment , many nursery and private , voluntary and independent settings do not use full ratios , ' she said			0
' we think teacher - led settings with full ratios and structured activities are a good thing			0
@entity134 will favour this too			0
we do not mean to stipulate how all settings should behave , but we want parents to have the choice			0
' setting out her plans to raise standards , she warned childcare workers need fewer qualifications than those working with animals			2
miss @entity11 expressed concern at the ‘ hair or care ’ stereotype of underqualified girls going into hairdressing or childminding			2
in a bid to drive up standards , the @entity154 education minister will insist nursery staff must have at least a c in gcse @entity159 and maths			1
the minister said : ‘ staff in this country earn about £ 6.60 an hour on average , only a little above the minimum wage			2
this speaks volumes for how much those working in the early years have hitherto been valued			0
’ allowing better qualified staff to look after more children , the government hopes pay levels in the childcare sector will increase new graduate level ‘ early years teachers ’ are to be specifically trained to teach young children			1
miss @entity11 said that ‘ too many people who work with young children are under - qualified ’			1
education minister @entity11 is expected to launch new tougher qualifications for people who want to look after pre-school children ‘ given what we know about early years development , it is no longer acceptable that childcare professionals are not required to have a gcse grade c or above in @entity159 and maths , ’ she said			1
highlighting the contrast with abroad , she added : ‘ in @entity63 , at least 40 per cent of staff in crèches must hold a diploma , which demands a three - year , post- 16 course			2
in the @entity62 , certified childcare workers must train for two years post- 18			0
’ expert @entity195 advisers have expressed concern at ‘ the hair or care stereotype ’ , in which often students with ‘ the poorest academic records ’ are steered towards childcare			0
she quoted @entity203 , head of early years and childhood studies at @entity205 , who said : ‘ we demand that students need a relevant qualification before they are able to handle animals independently on our animal care courses			0
nobody demands the same level of qualification before you can be left alone with a baby			0
’ older pre-school children do best in ‘ teacher - led settings ’ with ‘ structured activities ’ , which will be favoured by @entity134 , she will say			2
however , @entity219 ’s shadow education secretary @entity218 said the plans threatened child safety			0
‘ this government has created an affordability crisis by cutting support and pushing up costs for parents			2
watering down quality is the wrong way to try to deal with the problem they ’ve caused , ’ he said			0
‘ experts are warning this could threaten child safety and wo n’t reduce costs			0
’ @entity235 , general secretary of teaching union the @entity237 , said : ' no one doubts the importance of high - quality , affordable childcare			1
' seeking to drive down costs by packing more children into childcare settings compromises the quality of provision that is essential to the learning and development of the very youngest children			1
