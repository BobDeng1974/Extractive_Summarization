as i was speaking to a meeting of 200 small businesses in @entity3 last week , i was asked a question that is increasingly on my own mind			2
' with the economy suddenly looking so rosy , ' said one employer , ' how come @entity8 and the @entity9 are not on for a convincing victory at the next general election ? ' twenty - four hours earlier , the same query was put by a member of the audience during @entity16 's @entity15			2
it 's a fascinating subject			2
because there is no denying that in recent weeks , the economic news has been good			2
lord @entity20 , former trade minister under @entity21 , claims @entity22 and @entity23 were wrong on the economy unemployment has fallen again and again – it 's now at its lowest level for more than six years			1
in fact , so low are the jobless figures that in some cases , it 's almost time to talk about the unemployable rather than simply the unemployed			2
the number of jobs continues to soar			2
there are now almost 31 million @entity35 at work – a record figure			2
and while the jobs figures are on the up , inflation and interest rates are on the way down			1
at long last , wages are outstripping the cost of living – a just reward for workers after years of coping with soaring costs and no pay rises			0
on high streets up and down the country , you can almost touch the sense of confidence returning as consumer spending rises			0
as a result , people are able to pay more tax to fund the public services we depend on			0
of course , much of the recent good news is nothing to do with the @entity9 – it 's due to a welcome fall in oil and petrol prices			0
in that respect , @entity66 is not so much an economic genius as just plain lucky			0
but just as @entity70 preferred generals who were lucky , there 's no reason why we should n't prefer chancellors with ' bonne chance ' – especially if they seem to understand business and its importance to the country			0
the former @entity21 minister said @entity23 ( pictured ) issued dire , nightmare predictions of rocketing unemployment which brings me to @entity21 and @entity22			1
i served in the last @entity21 government as @entity86 's @entity85			1
i was a non-party political appointment – i 've never joined a political party – but it pains me to say that on the economy , @entity22 and his team have called it wrong time and time again			1
they issued dire , nightmare predictions of rocketing unemployment			1
they drew a gloomy picture of an economy by this stage of the cycle , becalmed at best , in freefall at worst			1
@entity22 did appear to score some successes – for example , his pledge to freeze energy prices was popular with many voters			1
but with the fall in worldwide oil costs , even that policy is looking threadbare			0
yet my biggest reservation about the @entity21 leader is not what he 's committed to , but what he wo n't say			1
i 'm still waiting to hear @entity22 pay tribute to business , salute the massed ranks of small firms up and down the country that are the backbone of the economy			1
from time to time , @entity122 , @entity21 's industry spokesman , and shadow chancellor @entity23 do say warm words about business			1
but that does n't matter until and unless we hear it from the lips of @entity22 himself			1
i live in hope that @entity22 will make a speech praising profit and congratulating people who create wealth			1
instead , the @entity21 leader prefers – as he did at one of his most important conference speeches – to talk instead about the evils of ' predator ' capitalism , not the benefits business brings			1
from time to time , @entity122 , @entity21 's industry spokesman , does say warm words about business without a thriving @entity143 , we ca n't have a wonderful @entity144 or any other viable public service for that matter			1
the fact that that is a @entity148 mantra , unfortunately for @entity21 , does n't make it any less true			1
all this may be why , as i meet businesses across the country , i detect a real worry at the thought of @entity22 getting his hands on the economic reins			1
they feel we 're finally going in the right direction and the last thing we need is a change of management – especially one that seems to have no empathy with business			0
they have another worry – @entity22 's avowed admiration for @entity170 president @entity169 's economic policies			1
@entity35 businesses do n't want @entity35 turning into @entity170 , with a @entity170 - style equivalent of a straitjacket for business			0
as for @entity176 , it is true that businesses hate the uncertainty of @entity8 's proposal for an in / out referendum on our @entity182 membership – a poll that is unlikely to take place before the end of 2017 at the earliest			0
far more preferable for company bosses would be a faster resolution of that debate			0
businesses do n't want an unreformed , sclerotic @entity176 that fails to encourage wealth creation and innovation			0
this is no @entity194 view			0
the people i talk to are as keen to see a prosperous @entity197 and @entity198 as any @entity199 or @entity200 because more wealth on the @entity202 means more money to buy @entity35 exports			0
i 'll mention one final worry business owners have shared with me – the prospect of @entity22 only getting the keys to @entity208 with the help of the @entity210			1
they are horrified at the idea of a @entity21 which has failed to win @entity194 being propped up in power by a party that wants to destroy the @entity35			2
which brings me back to that burning question – why , in the face of all these factors , are the @entity9 not on course for a majority or even a landslide on may 7 ? well , one big factor is this : despite all the economic good news , not everyone is benefiting			0
the @entity224 has been forced to take many hard decisions , and some of those decisions have hurt many people 's jobs and lifestyles			2
but here 's one straw in the wind			0
the week before last , the @entity9 had a terrible week – starting with the ill - timed ' @entity235 ' donors ' ball and ending with a barrage of damaging publicity about tax avoidance			0
despite that , they did not slip back in the polls			0
their ratings withstood the storm			0
i make no prediction about the election outcome – we must wait till may 7 for that			0
but just over two months out , electoral logic suggests that the 2015 election could be like the 1992 one – @entity21 seemingly on course to win until the last moment when voters balked at the thought of @entity253 and stuck with @entity254 and the @entity9			2
lord @entity20 , a cross-bench peer , served as @entity257 under the last @entity21 government .			1

@entity20 claims @entity22 and @entity23 were wrong on the economy
former trade minister under @entity21 says they made nightmare predictions
he said they drew gloomy picture of economy by this stage of the cycle
but pointed out jobs figures are up , inflation and interest rates are down
