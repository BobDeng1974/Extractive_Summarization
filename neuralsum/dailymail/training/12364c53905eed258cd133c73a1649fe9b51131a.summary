by @entity0 published : 15:17 est , 15 february 2013 updated : 17:17 est , 15 february 2013 a student has taken an @entity3 college to court , claiming it discriminates against poorer students			0
@entity6 , 26 , said he was unable to accept a place at the university ’s @entity8 because he could n’t prove he had £ 12,900 for his living costs			1
mr @entity6 , from @entity11 , believes the college ’s admissions policy discriminates against students who are unable to cover the ' excessive ' living costs			1
mr @entity6 believes that @entity8 's financial expectations are unreasonable for poorer students he is suing the college , claiming that the admission policy breached his ' right of access to education ' under @entity23 of the @entity24			1
he claims that his place on the year - long @entity27 course in economic and social history course was withdrawn due to the ' arbitrary figure ' set by the college			2
@entity30 heard how mr @entity6 , originally from @entity31 , @entity32 , already had £ 9,000 in place to cover his tuition fees when he completed his application for the 2012/13 course last january			1
he believes that @entity37 's have come up with an ' arbitrary ' figure designed for an excessive lifestyle he could not raise the £ 12,900 required to cover his living costs for a year			1
@entity42 , for the college , told the court that mr @entity6 had been aware when he made the application of the need to meet the financial guarantee and he ’d indicated he would be able to obtain the necessary funding			2
he said : ' there is no indication at this stage of mr @entity6 raising any issue with the living expenses being sought			2
' there were practical difficulties in getting the money together which were not to do with mr @entity6 ’s socio - economic status			0
' mr @entity6 claims the college ’s estimation of living costs include whether students have enough funds to dine in its restaurant , socialise and buy clothes and he would be able live on less money while supporting himself with part - time work			1
mr @entity68 said that mr @entity6 believes he can “ live more cheaply than the assumptions made ” but the figure for living expenses had ' not been plucked out of the air '			1
he said the figure was based on ' careful deliberations ' between college officials and students and was not an arbitrary amount			2
he said : ' the figures for living expenses are rational and carefully calculated			0
' ' student representatives are involved in keeping financial procedures carefully under review			0
' mr @entity68 also disputed whether @entity81 gave mr @entity6 the right to take the college course and he claimed it was necessary for the college to have financial guarantees as places on courses were limited and students were often forced to drop out because they could no longer fund themselves			2
mr @entity6 , who represented himself , argued that the college ’s estimation of living costs were not proportionate and the offer of places to poorer students was ' illusionary ' because they would never be able to meet its financial requirements			1
he said : ' somebody put it well to me yesterday			0
' scarcity is a good reason for rationing but not a good reason for sending poor people to the back of the queue			0
' he refuted the college ’s claim that his stance had become a point of principal only when he realised he would not be able to come up with the £ 14,500			0
mr @entity6 , who has since taken up a position with the civil service , said there were three key questions for the court to consider : whether the college ’s admission policy was lawful , whether it served a real need and whether it was proportionate			0
@entity8 ( pictured ) claim that their standard for living costs has been carefully calculated the court heard that the college ’s estimation for living costs included items such as £ 453 for clothes for the year , £ 67 per week for meals provided by the college , and £ 2500 for general expenses			1
there was a separate amount for the costs of entrance into local nightclubs			0
mr @entity6 claimed that many items were optional costs which were ' to support a particular lifestyle ' and could not be considered part of normal living expenses			1
he is not seeking damages in the case but a judgement which forces the college to change its policy			0
the college sought to have the case dismissed , but judge mr @entity148 said he would reserve judgement until a later date .			0

@entity6 , 26 , turned down his place at @entity8 after he could not prove he had £ 12,900 for living costs
he believes that the amount was designed for an excessive lifestyle
the college says that the figure is the result of careful calculations
