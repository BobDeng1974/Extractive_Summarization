victory : @entity2 's @entity1 benefited from a big swing away from the @entity4 @entity2 has delivered a humiliating blow to the @entity4 with a resounding by - election victory in @entity9 ’s backyard			1
@entity2 supporters said @entity12 first minister @entity11 had received a ‘ gubbing ’ at the hands of voters , following an 11 per cent swing			1
the result is a further set - back for mr @entity11 ’s @entity4 ahead of this year ’s referendum on @entity12 independence , which polls suggest he is on course to lose			2
the by - election for the @entity26 seat in the @entity27 was held following the death of @entity30 @entity29 in november , just days after it emerged she was being treated for cancer			1
@entity26 in @entity32 , to the north of @entity34 , is part of @entity9 ’s seat at @entity37			2
the former prime minister remains a very popular figure in this part of @entity12 , and he repeatedly took to the streets with his wife @entity42 during the campaign			0
@entity32 leader @entity1 , a former election agent for mr @entity9 , was defending a @entity2 majority of just over 1,200			2
the seat was one of only 15 that @entity2 held in the @entity27 election of 2011 when the @entity4 stormed to power with a landslide victory			1
but @entity2 won yesterday ’s battle with a majority of 5,488 and a huge 55.8 per cent share of the vote , up 9.3 percentage points since 2011			2
the @entity4 trailed in second place with just 28.4 per cent , which was down 13.2 points			2
the @entity57 increased their share of the vote to 9.4 per cent , with @entity60 in a distant fourth place on just 3 per cent			0
but the most humiliating result was for the @entity63 , whose popularity in @entity12 has plummeted after joining the @entity66 in coalition at @entity37			0
they received just 425 votes , or 2.1 per cent of the total – and lost their deposit			1
turnout in the contest was only 34.81 per cent , and was as low as 11 per cent in one part of the constituency			0
defeat : the result signalled a major swing away from @entity11 's @entity4 @entity1 said : “ i 'm delighted and humbled that the people of @entity26 have put their faith in me to be their next msp			1
" we fought this campaign on the issues and concerns of hard working @entity84			0
@entity85 , skills , training and opportunities for our young will be my priority and must be for the @entity90			0
” @entity92 @entity91 added : “ for @entity92 , we are encouraged that the people of @entity12 are responding our positive message of reality and change and we are determined to build on this emphatic result as we enter a crucial period in our country 's future			0
" ' the people of @entity12 are responding to our positive message ' : labour leader @entity91 @entity2 ’s victory comes after the party gained the neighbouring @entity105 seat with a majority of 2,783 over the @entity4 in october , which was the first time a seat had changed hands in a @entity27 by - election for 13 years			1
that victory came despite a widespread feeling that @entity2 had a much weaker candidate than the @entity4 , and ran a dismal campaign			2
this time around , mr @entity1 proved an effective operator and was boosted by high - profile appearances from shadow chancellor @entity117 , as well as mr @entity9 and his wife @entity42			0
charity worker @entity119 , a rising star in the @entity4 , was the main challenger to mr @entity1			0
a regular television pundit , she is very well liked in the party and beyond , and is expected to be an elected member at some point in the future			0
@entity4 business convener @entity128 said : “ the @entity4 fought a strong campaign with an excellent candidate in @entity119 , and we made the issues of the by - election the issues that matter to the people - the council tax freeze , free school meals and extending childcare			1
" the share of the vote we achieved was the same as our performance in 2007 - when we won a national election across @entity12 for the very first time - and therefore is an extremely creditable performance			0
“ this was the only seat in @entity32 we did n't win at the high water mark of 2011 , it has remained a @entity2 seat in the by - election , and we wish @entity1 well in representing the people of @entity26 constituency			1
" however , the swing @entity2 achieved in @entity26 is only around half the swings the @entity4 achieved in by - elections when @entity2 were in government , such as in @entity153 and @entity154 , which indicates the underlying strength of the @entity4 after nearly seven years in office			1
