cats can sometimes be a mystery , even to their owners			2
but our felines friends may not be as difficult to understand as you might think , with clues to their personality hidden in their features			0
this is according to a @entity11 - based cat behaviourist who has identified three different types of cat face shape that she says can accurately reveal personality			1
' square cats tend to be affectionate and love to snuggle and give head - butts , ' said cat behaviourist , @entity22 ' cat face geometry is one of the best tools for matching a cat to a person , ' says @entity22 , author of ' @entity27 : @entity28 , healthier , @entity29 '			1
' it especially helps with " mutt " cats whose breed can not be determined			0
' while @entity22 's theory is not based on any scientific study , she says experience has revealed there is a strong link between looks and personality			2
this may be because different breeds of cats , with distinct behaviours , often have the same face shape			0
for instance , some cats , such as @entity49 , can have square faces and bodies			1
these cats are often keen to please their owners			2
' @entity55 cats tend to be affectionate and love to snuggle and give head - butts , ' said @entity22			1
triangular cats have been referred to as ' the herding dogs of the cat world			1
' triangular cats are thought to do best in active households and are usually busy , curious , smart and vocal cats with round faces have flatter features , large eyes , circular heads and rounded bodies			1
@entity22 describes them as the ' lap dogs ' of the feline world			0
' they tend to be low - energy , easily frightened , submissive cats that gently display their affection to trusted family members , ' she said according to a report in the @entity80 , the best type of owner for these cats is one that has a a social life , works a 9 - to - 5 job and has a family who will play with the pet			1
meanwhile , also have flatter features , large eyes , circular heads , and rounded bodies , such as a @entity90 cat			0
@entity22 describes them as the ' lap dogs ' of the feline world , and ' library cats '			2
square - ' the retrievers ' these cats are often large with square faces and bodies			1
@entity99 , the largest domesticated breed of cat , falls into this category			0
they have been described as the ' retrievers of the cat world			0
' cats with square faces are often keen to please their owners			1
' @entity55 cats tend to be affectionate and love to snuggle and give head - butts , ' said cat behaviourist , @entity22			1
ideal owner : works a 9 - to - 5 job and has a family who will play with the pet			0
round - ' the lapdogs ' cats with round faces also have flatter features , large eyes , circular heads , and rounded bodies			1
an example would be the @entity90 cat			0
@entity22 describes them as the ' lap dogs ' of the feline world			0
' they tend to be low - energy , easily frightened , submissive cats that gently display their affection to trusted family members , ' she said			1

triangular - ' the herders ' cats with triangular faces include @entity143 or @entity144 cats			2
they are sleek and lanky cats , often boasting big ears and faces that narrow at the nose			0
they have been referred to as ' the herding dogs of the cat world			0

ideal owner : someone who wants to show off their pet and teach it tricks , and who does n't own , another submissive cat			0

most would prefer to look out of a window and watch the scenery than snuggle on your lap. @entity22 says they are the perfect cats for people who want to teach their pets tricks			2
she adds that basing a cat 's face shape on their personality is remains a theory and not based on scientific studies			2
cats with triangular faces ( left ) are busy , curious , smart and vocal , while cats with rounder faces ( right ) are more affectionate , quiet and shy			1

some cats , such as @entity203 , can have square faces and bodies
these cats are often affectionate and are keen to please their owners
cats with round faces tend to be low - energy , quiet , shy and submissive
triangular cats are busy , curious , vocal and thrive in active households
this is according to a theory by @entity219 - based cat behaviourist @entity22
