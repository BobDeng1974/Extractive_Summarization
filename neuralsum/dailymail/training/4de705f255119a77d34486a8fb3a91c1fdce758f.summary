by @entity0 for @entity1 a pair of brothers have come up with a way to have a high - flying holiday on a budget – by building a human catapult @entity8 and @entity9 had been looking for a cheap alternative to flying , so constructed a 1,100lb catapult out of wood and old bicycle tubes			1
despite the device raising several health and safety issues , the brothers claim they have taken precautions , by getting clarification from the @entity21			0
@entity8 , an engineering student , and @entity9 , a maths graduate , then spent ten months constructing the mammoth machine in their grandmother ’s barn , using old bicycle tubes as the spring			1
the contraption fires a person of average height and weight a distance of 40 feet , sending them about 16ft into the air			2
@entity8 said : ‘ @entity9 and i wanted to give people the chance to fly - without the need for a plane			2
‘ you might not get as far , but it will certainly be hell of a lot of fun			0
' safety first : the home - made human catapult sends a person into a 16ft high arch , and into a lake brothers in arms : @entity60 , 26 , and brother @entity9 , 28 , from @entity27 constructed the human catapult out of wood and old bicycle tubes spare - time fun : the brothers spent ten months in their grandmother 's barn , constructing the human catapult come fly with me : engineering student @entity8 , gives a thumbs up before being launched into the lake up , up and away : to make sure their device was safe , the brothers had their catapult certified by the @entity21 mr @entity76 added : ‘ all the research and funding was boring - but necessary - but now it 's finished , the catapult is nothing but fun ! ‘ people ca n't really control what they do mid-air but more often than not they end up doing a somersault			1
’ to make sure nobody passed out from the @entity88 forces , the pair contacted the @entity89 for clarification			0
@entity8 said : ‘ our grand uncle told us people passed out in war planes from acceleration and we did n't want that happening			0
‘ fortunately everything 's alright and nobody has died yet ! ’ great success : @entity8 and @entity9 are pleased with their human catapult as no one has died yet ! holidaying on a budget : the brothers say that the aim of the catapult was to offer everyone a chance to fly			1

@entity8 and @entity9 built a 1,100lb contraption themselves
@entity111 flings a person 40ft into *adjacent* lake , in a 16ft high arc
the brothers raised £ 700 through crowdfunding to build the catapult
