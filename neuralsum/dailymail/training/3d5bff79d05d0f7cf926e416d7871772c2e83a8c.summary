she said restaurant manager @entity48 gave her the cleaning product , which he thought was vinegar , to help cure her hiccups			1
' he gave it to me and said " here you go – down the hatch " and i hesitated a bit and then i was like oh ok you know , so i took it straight down - swallowed it all in one			2
' she labelled mr @entity48 as a ' coward ' for not apologising for ruining her life and she had also not received a cent from his insurance company			0
' i just think they 're waiting for me to die – they are just pushing paper around , ' she said			0
' everybody is shocked - they ca n't believe that essentially it 's just , you know , business as usual			2
' mr @entity48 ' insurance company , @entity71 , has accepted indemnity on behalf of their client for this ' unfortunate event ' and are working to ' settle as quickly as possible '			0
ms @entity8 said that her insides were so badly burned from the oven cleaner that doctors did not expect her to survive the night			1
' it damaged everything — my tongue , my voice box , all the way down and stopped at the top of my stomach , ' she said			0
' i heard one of the doctors say to another " i heard it 's really bad " and she said " it 's catastrophic " and then said " 72 hours "			0
' the 40 - year - old has been forced to leave her career as a lawyer behind and fork out over $ 100,000 for her medical bills , while having to rely on a full - time carer for her three - year - old son she has also been left unable to eat and relies on liquid bags of food that cost over $ 500 a week ' instantly , instantly i do n't know how to explain it			1

but it was her son that pulled her out of the coma three days later			0
' that ’s when i was thinking of my little boy - i was thinking ' he needs me , he needs his mum ' , she said			0
' i remember just mentally going – " you ’ve just go to fight – you 're not going to die like this '			0
' however , choosing to live has cost her a lifetime of unbearable pain and a financial cost of $ 1,000 per week for medication and liquid food			2
' you have to go to another place in your mind because the pain is so bad that you would do anything to get away from it , ' she explained			0
' i have the feeding tube so that is like my main back up nutrition – that ’s what has kept me alive			0
