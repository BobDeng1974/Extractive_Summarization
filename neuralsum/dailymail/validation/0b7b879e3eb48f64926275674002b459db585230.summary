' this means it is quite natural for @entity1 to wander and find other males to hang around with			0
' @entity1 is very playful and finds everything interesting and will be sure to keep @entity6 and the visitors entertained			0
' the park said @entity1 , who may one day be part of the @entity45 , was brought to @entity46 from a zoo outside @entity19 in the @entity20 in an operation this week			1
@entity1 arrived at the park yesterday morning ( pictured ) before being released in the polar enclosure polar bears are a species that are increasingly being threatened in their native habitat on monday he was transported in a specialist lorry to @entity24 for the overnight ferry trip to @entity26 , arriving at the @entity3 park on yesterday morning			0
mr @entity37 said @entity6 , who weighs 480kg , gave a roar when he realised there was an new arrival at @entity60 , the park 's purpose - built 10 acre polar bear reserve			1
he said : ' @entity6 was immediately on his guard when he realised another polar bear was there			2
but after a roar or two he settled down			0
once released in the enclosure pixel immediately took a dip following his long journey from the @entity20 to his obvious delight the polar bear caught a fish in the large pond within his enclosure ' once @entity1 is settled in the plan will be to introduce them together as soon as possible			1
@entity1 is going to look so small compared to big old @entity6			0
' mr @entity37 added : ' polar bears are an iconic species that are increasingly threatened in their native habitat and we need to fight their cause			0
' their native sea ice is disappearing due to climate change but we still have a chance to do something about it and at @entity60 we can share with visitors how they can help			0
' it is also vital that we understand how to care for these bears appropriately in captivity and provide for their needs			0
' the initial research into @entity6 has been extremely encouraging and @entity1 's arrival is a bonus			2
