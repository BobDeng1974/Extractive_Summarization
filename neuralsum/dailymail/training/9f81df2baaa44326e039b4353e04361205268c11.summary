@entity2 spent weeks searching for his beloved companion @entity5 after she vanished from his home in @entity16 , @entity17			1
the 52 - year - old covered walls in his neighbourhood with posters appealing for his pet 's return but heard nothing until the typed letter was sent to a local antiques shop and florist			1
the note , purporting to be from the missing moggy , thanked locals for their concern but told them she was happy with her new life in the countryside			2
it said : ' i made friends with two very nice people who live in the country and when they invited me to come and live with them i said " yes please "			2
' i am well , very happy , love living in the countryside and can run up and down the stairs really fast now			2
' i follow my friends into the bathroom , watch them shower , bounce on their bed and help type things on their computer			2
' i miss you all , especially my @entity49			2
please let him know i am ok			2
' the letter - signed @entity50 xxxx - was immediately passed on to devastated mr @entity2 who contacted the police			1
he said the initial sense of relief he felt knowing his treasured pet is still alive , quickly turned to anger			1
branding the letter ' sick ' , mr @entity2 said : ' when i read the contents my relief quickly turned to anger			1
they must know it 's my cat , she 's so well known around town			2
' she 's a very independent , sociable cat that wanders around every day			2
whoever did this is sick			1
@entity5 is my only companion			1
kidnapped : @entity68 disappeared from her @entity17 home in september			1
the ' thief ' responsible for her disappearance sent the letter taunting mr @entity2 , telling him she ' loves her new life ' desperate : mr @entity2 put up posters appealing for help to find three - year - old @entity5 , his ' only companion '			1
he said his initial relief at knowing she is alive quickly turned to anger as he branded the letter ' sick ' ' i guess they did n't have the guts to post this letter through my door directly because they were worried i would have caught them			1
to all my good friends in @entity90 you so much for taking care of me when i lived in @entity93 liked living in the town and visiting you all			0
you were so kind and fed me all sorts of treats			0
i had a bed in lots of the shops and @entity101 made friends with two very nice people who live in the countryside and when they invited me to go and live with them i said ' yes please '			0
even though i did n't show it			0
i became a little frightened and nervous after my accident and @entity16 suddenly seemed a very busy place to me.i am well , very happy , love living in the countryside and can run up and down the stairs really fast now			0

i just want her back safe and well			0
' @entity132 mr @entity2 said for the last three years @entity5 , who was six months old when he picked her up has been his ' only companion '			1
she lost her leg in august when he found her lying injured beside the road			1
vets were n't able to say what caused the wounds but said it was likely the cat 's limb was crushed			1
@entity5 had the leg amputated but was otherwise making a full recovery when she vanished weeks later			0
the well - known feline was even made an honorary member of the @entity147 after mr @entity2 took her along to meetings			1
officers are yet to establish whether it was a genuine theft , a prank - or both			1
but kitchen porter mr @entity2 is convinced the black and white cat , who disappeared on september 8 , was stolen			1
he said : ' when i saw the letter my blood was boiling with anger ; it 's disgusting			1
' whoever took her knows who i am because the letter says , " i miss you all , especially my dad ; please let him know i 'm ok "			0
' she 's a right little character around the town and everybody knows her			0
she was really happy where she was and had lots of friends			0
' she was like a dog in the sense that she wagged her tail when she was happy			0
i miss her and just want her back			0
' whoever did it is probably keeping her locked in and she hates to be kept inside			0
i 've asked window cleaners and postmen to keep an eye out as well			0
' @entity182 @entity181 of @entity183 and @entity184 , said : ' it 's obviously a very upsetting case and we 're just looking to reunite the cat with its owner , so all information would be welcome			2
