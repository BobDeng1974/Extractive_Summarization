@entity0 has a rare luxury as an @entity3 manager in that he has a year to build a team who are almost sure to qualify for @entity6			1
it probably does not feel that way to him , as every game as @entity3 manager feels as though it has potential dangers			1
but , in reality , @entity3 have weathered the storm of their @entity15 disappointment and are now firmly focused on @entity6			1
i fully expect the team to make another step in that direction in @entity20 on sunday			0
given that we are almost certain to qualify , i believe there is an opportunity to be bold and try different players			0
@entity0 has settled on the diamond formation as one way of playing and , as such , that needs a good holding player			1
@entity30 midfielder @entity29 during one of his four caps with @entity3 previously this graphic shows how @entity3 could line up if @entity29 was to be introduced into the diamond @entity35 did do really well there on thursday night , though it is difficult to judge against @entity38 when you have so much time on the ball			1
and it is not his natural game			0
on thursday night , both @entity44 and i came up with the name of @entity29 as an alternative			1
he is not currently in favour			0
he has just four caps and has been used only once by @entity0 , as a substitute in a friendly against @entity52			2
as a sitting player , there are few englishmen who can match @entity29			1
he does that job of screening the back four and he has a range of passing that few can match			0
i am also looking forward to the return of @entity63			0
with @entity65 and @entity66 fit , @entity3 could field a fearsome front three			2
i think they could all play together , with @entity66 playing just behind the front two , as he has started to do for his club			0
there would still be room for @entity73			0
he has the tactical awareness to play on the outside of the diamond and give you width			2
@entity79 and @entity44 both feel @entity29 could be a sufficient alternative in the @entity3 diamond @entity29 ( right ) could give @entity3 manager @entity0 an option as an alternative holding midfielder in a diamond , i always like to have it a little lop - sided , with one player on the outside who can go a bit wider and one who tucks inside			1
@entity73 would give you that option			0
@entity92 would be perfect to go on the left , or @entity35			2
and you still have @entity94 , @entity95 and , when he is fit , @entity96 to add to that mix. there is a great range of attacking options for @entity3 coming through , with the potential to generate excitement			2
with this run of qualification games , we have a chance to nail down an attacking system and get so confident with it , so that by the time we get to @entity6 , we may be causing teams so many problems we can worry less about the problems they are causing us			0
@entity0 has settled on the diamond formation and , as such , that needs a good holding player to turn to			1

@entity0 has settled on the diamond formation for @entity3
a good holding player is a *necessity* and @entity35 did well in that position on thursday night , though difficult to judge against @entity38
here , former @entity3 manager @entity79 tells @entity123 why he feels @entity30 midfielder @entity29 is an ideal *candidate*
