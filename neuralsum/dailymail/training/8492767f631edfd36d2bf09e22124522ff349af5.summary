one cold night in february 1949 a supper party was held in @entity1 , @entity2 , to introduce the newly - selected conservative party candidate for @entity4 to some of the local bourgeoisie			2
the @entity8 candidate was the soft - cheeked , hawk - nosed @entity9			2
perfect political spouse : sir @entity11 and @entity9 in 2003 a few months before @entity11 passed away among the guests was the managing director of the @entity14 , which had diversified out of weedkiller and sheep - dip and was now making good money manufacturing paint			1
the man from @entity14 , bespectacled , balding , rich and raffish , was the war hero , amateur rugby referee and divorcé @entity11			1
he had seen miss @entity9 in full flow at the selection meeting and he was impressed , in more than one way			2
so , it turned out , was she			2
they married in 1951 , at @entity26 in @entity27 , @entity28			2
@entity11 , who would remain her steadfast , cheerful , shrewd companion until his death in june 2003 , proved the perfect political husband			1
that is to say he had no political ambition of his own and managed never to cause her problems			2
at the end of each long , lonely day she served as prime minister he would hand her a whisky and offer a friendly ear to the wife he fondly addressed as ‘ old girl ’			2
‘ when i ’m in a state , ’ she said , ‘ i have no one to turn to except @entity11			1
he puts his arm round me and says “ @entity49 , you sound just like @entity50 ”			2
and then i always laugh			2
’ for more than half a century he was at @entity9 ’s side , from the day she entered @entity53 ( photographs caught him standing , smart white hanky in his top pocket , in the doorway to no 10 while she gave her @entity59 spiel to the tv cameras ) to the day she left in tears , @entity11 next to her in the back of the official @entity63			1
when @entity9 flew to international summits , @entity11 would usually be somewhere in the background , bringing a touch of the @entity68 golf club bar to whatever exotic destination they ’d flown to			1
snapshots normally caught him standing at a slight angle , snaggle teeth and spectacles reflecting the glare of the camera flashbulbs			0
@entity11 saw her through good ( the election victories ) and bad ( the @entity79 bomb — not to mention all those times when it seemed that the whole @entity83 political establishment was plotting to unseat her )			1
he was the constant element in a turbulent premiership , never complaining , frequently cheering her up with some pungent put - down of a hated rival			1
oh , to know what he made of @entity89 ! and oh , to have been a fly on the wall when he and that other remarkable consort , the @entity93 , neither versed in political correctness , got together at @entity95 while their wives were seeing to matters of state			0
when they had first met in 1949 , @entity11 was arguably a cut or two above his new wife in rank , having come into money			1
long - lasting marriage : @entity11 and @entity9 on their wedding day in 1951 the courtship was conducted at some of @entity28 ’s better restaurants — the @entity111 in @entity112 and the @entity113 just north of @entity114			1
he drove her around town in a @entity117			0
on christmas day 1949 , he gave her an expensive present of a crystal powder bowl with a silver top			0
she treasured it for ever			0
maybe @entity11 ’s smartish background helped to stiffen @entity9 ’s resolve in 1981 when she stood up to the drawling , sneering snoots of her first @entity126			1
@entity11 was not one to be browbeaten by hair - oiled humbugs from the old - boys ’ club			1
he knew their type , not least from the rugby clubs , and he would have told @entity9 firmly to remember that she was the boss			0
she duly sacked several of her @entity126 enemies , replacing them with truer believers in her politics of aspiration and merit			0
‘ for 40 years , ’ he said in 1991 , ‘ i have been married to the greatest woman the world has ever produced			1
all i could produce — small as it may be — was love and loyalty			0
’ @entity11 brought normality , humour and non-negotiable love to her years in high office			1
he gave her financial stability and emotional resilience			0
he provided the domestic guy ropes without which her whole tent might have collapsed			0
and he did it with such humour			0
one of his favourite expressions , when describing some political character , was to say that so - and - so was ‘ as much use as a one - legged man in an arse - kicking contest ’			0
with such turns of phrase , he was able to shake his wife out of her darkest moods			0
‘ @entity161 keep your mouth shut and be thought a fool rather than open it and remove all doubt , ’ @entity11 reportedly said another time			1
he knew that as the husband of such a controversial figure he could cause her political trouble , and so he created for himself the image of a bumbling boozer			2
supportive : @entity9 getting a kiss from @entity11 after she had come out on top in the first round of the election for the @entity8 leadership @entity9 certainly never saw him as this chumpish caricature			1
you only have to read her account of the 1949 @entity11 — ‘ he had a penchant for fast cars and he simply knew more about the world than i did ’ — to see that she always looked up to him			1
it is sometimes said that sensible women look for a husband like their father			2
@entity9 ’s father had been the stalwart alderman @entity190 , grocer and mayor of @entity193			0
@entity11 , being ten years older than @entity9 and already experienced in the world ( with all that entailed ) , was certainly a father figure in some ways			1
and was there not something selflessly parental in the way he devoted himself to her during those years of astonishing political service ? presented with the question ‘ who wears the trousers in your marriage ? ’ , @entity11 replied happily : ‘ i do			1
i also wash them and iron them			0
’ his wife ’s political duties came first			0
asked what the role of a political spouse was , @entity11 replied that it was to be ‘ always present , never there ’			1
he perfectly understood the need for omnipresent discretion			0
was sir @entity11 disconsolate at having lost the keys to @entity53 ? was he heck			1
a reporter asked if he would miss being garlanded at the next @entity8 party conference			0
he practically exploded with laughter			0
‘ thank goodness i do n’t have to go to the bloody thing , ’ he said			0
‘ i have a business to run			0
i still have to make a living			0
’ and when , at the age of 77 , he received treatment for cancer , some ‘ reptile ’ ( as he called members of the @entity233 ) approached him at @entity230			0
how was sir @entity11 proposing to recuperate , asked the newshound			1
sir @entity11 lifted his bag of @entity237 purchases and replied : ‘ gin and cigarettes ! ’ perhaps we can comfort ourselves that in @entity242 last night , as @entity9 walked through @entity244 ’s pearly gates , she ’ll have been met by a familiar , snaggle - toothed smile and a hug from her beloved husband with the words : ‘ there you are , old girl			1
whatever kept you ? now , how about a good , strong whisky ? ’			0

her husband @entity11 was the constant element in a turbulent premiership
he said he was married to ' greatest woman the world ever produced '
