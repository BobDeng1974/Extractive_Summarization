@entity1 and @entity2 have instructed government advisers to ' ignore ' the will of @entity5 to reform human rights law , it was claimed yesterday			1
the explosive allegation was made by dr @entity8 as he resigned in protest from the @entity11 @entity10 on a @entity12			2
@entity13 established the commission in the hope of finding a way to stop human rights rulings damaging @entity11 's national interests after the @entity19 voted overwhelmingly against a ruling by the unelected @entity21 in @entity22 that prisoners should be allowed to vote			1
@entity1 and @entity2 have instructed government advisers to ' ignore ' the will of @entity5 to reform human rights law , dr @entity8 claimed @entity26 want the commission to consider introducing a ' democratic override ' – which would allow @entity5 to reject harmful verdicts from @entity22			1
but dr @entity8 said he had been secretly told by @entity31 justice secretary mr @entity2 and @entity32 leader mr @entity1 to ignore ' agitation from @entity5 '			1
the hugely - respected political scientist claims the panel – which is stuffed with liberals hand - picked by mr @entity1 – has effectively been told to reach the conclusion that no change is needed to human rights law			2
resignation : dr @entity41 has attacked both @entity1 and @entity2 yesterday , it also emerged that the commission is objecting to giving @entity5 a greater say on the grounds that ' many of the most objectionable laws in @entity48 were passed , at least in the early years , by a democratically elected assembly '			1
members believe that allowing mps to override human rights is the tyranny of the majority			1
dr @entity8 was considered by many @entity31 mps as their best hope for securing meaningful reform			2
but he decided to quit after a row with sir @entity59 , the chairman , whom he accuses of giving undue weight to human rights lobbies			2
claiming that ' the @entity32 tail is wagging the @entity31 dog ' , dr @entity8 also attacked mr @entity2 , who has repeatedly clashed with his own party over human rights and is a strong supporter of the @entity22 court			1
he said mr @entity2 was ' sidelining not only parliament but also the prime minister , and i consider that disloyal '			2
he told the @entity74 's @entity73 programme : ' the commission answers to @entity2 – he and @entity1 set it up and selected the chairman			2
his civil servants run the commission and staffing , his hands are everywhere			2
the commissioners were called in last december by @entity2 and @entity1 and told we should ignore what was called “ agitation ” from @entity5			1
' now i consider that a ten to one vote , an overwhelming vote ( on prisoner voting ) by our @entity87 , ca n't be dismissed as agitation			2
' explaining his decision to quit , dr @entity8 said : ' i could have settled for a quiet life , but it goes against my deepest convictions to sacrifice our parliamentary sovereignty , which is at stake , and i 'm afraid i 'll have to pay the price			2
' incredibly , he said , the issue of parliamentary sovereignty had been discussed only once since the commission was established in february last year			2
he also claimed he had been leant on by the @entity101 not to issue a statement arguing for parliamentary powers to override @entity22			1
he said he was told ' the @entity32 wo n't agree '			2
respected political scientist @entity104 has now resigned from the @entity11 @entity10 on a @entity12 in protest at what he says is the government 's stance on human rights law a series of leaked e-mails yesterday laid bare the tensions within the commission , which is supposed to be examining the case for a @entity11 @entity12 to replace @entity117 's @entity116			0
the messages , seen by the @entity119 , show the commission arguing forcefully that @entity5 should not be allowed to ' override ' controversial judgments			1
one says : ' if a right or freedom is fundamental , how can it be right to allow any legislature , however democratic , to override it ? it should be remembered that many of the most objectionable laws passed in @entity48 were passed , at least in the early years , by a democratically elected assembly			1
' a @entity101 spokesman said : ' we are aware that there have been some internal difficulties within the commission			0
' commentary by dr @entity137 - @entity136 my background gives me a unique insight into the reality of human rights			0
i was born into a @entity144 family in @entity145 in 1943 and i am lucky to be one of the youngest survivors of the @entity148			0
as an infant in @entity151 under @entity48 occupation , my life was saved when a deal was done with @entity155 ’s monstrous henchmen in the @entity156 , @entity157 and @entity158			0
the lives of 20 @entity144 families were spared in return for ransom money			0
i was among those spared , while 20,000 others were put on trains for gas chambers of @entity171 was an experience that led me to fight for human rights all my life , as reflected , for example , during my work during the @entity164 in the 1960s when i liaised with the @entity175 to prevent humanitarian abuses			0
i know what the abuse of human rights really means			0
it is certainly not the kind of nonsense we hear so much about today – parents smacking children , the eviction of travellers from illegal encampments or the deportation of foreign criminals in breach of their supposed ‘ right to a family life ’			0
yet these are the conflicts that have occupied debate over human rights law in recent years , with the @entity11 @entity5 endlessly accused of defying the @entity21			1
human rights : mr @entity13 set up an eight - strong commission which was asked to examine the implementation of a @entity11 @entity12 the conflict was seen at its most stark over the question of voting rights for prisoners , something which has been demanded by @entity22 but overwhelmingly rejected by the @entity87			1
it was in february last year after a @entity19 vote on the matter that @entity13 set up an eight - strong commission which was asked to examine the implementation of a @entity11 @entity12 , which would reconcile human rights legislation with @entity11 law			0
as a political scientist with a long record in studying the development of democratic institutions , i was asked to be part of this commission , whose chairman is the former civil servant sir @entity59			1
initially , i had high hopes , believing we could achieve a synthesis between human rights and the democratic will of @entity5			1
but it has become obvious that some of the predominant members on the commission were not remotely interested in such an outcome			0
all they wanted to do was uphold the status quo and ensure that the influence of @entity5 continued to be ignored			1
effectively , the commission has been hijacked by the @entity32 and the grandees of the human rights culture			0
the views of the prime minister and his senior @entity31 colleagues count for almost nothing			0
the truth is that the body has taken little trouble to be in touch with the impulses of the @entity11 people and it has rejected my proposals for 50 public meetings to be held to discuss the issue			0
instead , it will hold just one public meeting in @entity250			0
it even refused to include a question about the role of the @entity22 court in our questionnaire			1
it also would n’t ask the public about the prime minister ’s statement that decisions should be made in @entity5 rather than in the courts			1
that is why my position has become intolerable and i have taken the most difficult decision in my life : to resign from the commission			0
i had tried strenuously to ensure that the commission gave heed to the views of @entity5 , but i have found myself sidelined , bullied , marginalised and ignored			1
the whole affair has made a farce not only of democracy but also of genuine human rights			0
it seems that those leading members of the fashionable human rights culture are not really interested in tackling real humanitarian abuses or instances of true political oppression			0
instead , they revel in demonstrating the superiority of the @entity11 and @entity282 judiciary over our elected representatives			0
rights rulings : decisions handed down by the @entity21 in @entity22 have been criticised i find utterly intolerable this perversion of human rights – which treats the issue as nothing more than an arena for political power games			1
in my work on the commission , i was determined to see that @entity5 had the ability to override decisions by the @entity21 – such as prisoners ’ votes or rulings stopping the deportation of foreign criminals			1
but to my despair , the commission was managed in a manner that ensured the rigid orthodoxy of submission to @entity22 prevailed – despite my views and those of other @entity31 appointees			1
when i tried to raise the question of parliamentary sovereignty with sir @entity59 , he not only refused but even took me into a basement room of the @entity314 to warn me that i would be considered a maverick without influence if i persisted in my demand			0
in the same vein , when the commission , four months after its establishment , put out a paper for public consultation on a @entity11 @entity12 , it deliberately left out any reference to @entity13 ’s statement on the need to uphold parliamentary sovereignty on key political decisions such as prisoners ’ voting rights			0
the opinions of the prime minister were treated with contempt while those of his @entity335 junior colleagues , especially @entity2 and @entity1 , carried much more weight			0
in fact , in december , members were summoned to a meeting with @entity2 and told to defer any discussion about @entity5 overriding @entity22 and ignore any ‘ agitation ’ from the @entity19 on the issue			1
this meeting was a dramatic illustration of the low priority given to the basis of our democracy – the @entity87			0
similarly , the commission regularly heard evidence from human rights groups , which of course have a vested interest in maintaining the status quo , yet proceeded to ignore @entity26 and peers who wanted to curb the power of the human rights court			1
this is why i ’ve had enough			0
i can no longer put up with the sneering , contemptuous attitude of the human rights brigade towards the concept of parliamentary sovereignty			0
the will of the people is not a form of tyranny or ‘ mob rule ’ , as they condescendingly seem to believe , but is a bulwark of freedom , as is clearly demonstrated by the long , progressive narrative of @entity11 history			0
our nation was enjoying real human rights long before the @entity22 court was convened			1
and , crucially , those rights will only be weakened if an unelected , unaccountable elite holds sway over democratic institutions .			2

@entity26 want to look at introducing a ' democratic override ' which would allow @entity5 to reject harmful verdicts from @entity22
