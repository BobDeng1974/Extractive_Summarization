after a lightning - fast summer assault by @entity3 that saw most of @entity4 fall into their hands , the country 's military is now fighting back and has won a string of symbolic victories			1
but while @entity4 's leaders insist it is their army on the offensive , in reality the victories are being won by a powerful @entity15 general - the ' fearless ' @entity14			1
refusing to wear a bullet - proof vest on the front lines , and with his motto ' death is the beginning of life , not the end ' , he has inspired @entity25 troops to victory where the government has failed			0
' fearless ' : while the @entity25 military has claimed a series of victories against @entity3 in recent weeks , sources have attributed them to the @entity15 general @entity14 ( pictured ) who is said to be leading attacks inspiring : @entity14 ( second right ) was also said to have lead troops to victory in @entity36 and @entity37 with his motto ' death is the beginning of life , not the end ' as @entity3 militants retreated from the town of @entity45 last week , relinquishing their hold for the first time since august , @entity14 was credited with the victory , according to military sources			1
militia commanders said that dozens of advisers from @entity52 and the @entity53 were on the front lines in @entity45			2
they said the men provided weapons training to some 7,000 @entity25 troops and militia fighters and coordinated with military commanders ahead of the operation			0
one commander , who agreed to be identified only by his nickname , @entity63 , said @entity14 began planning the @entity45 operation three months ago			0
in @entity36 in august and in @entity37 in june , top officials say @entity14 was on hand , pacing along with the @entity25 troops , and using his tactical abilities to drive the @entity69 militants back into the desert			1
a top @entity72 official even suggested that @entity14 and his crack @entity75 force were on hand to help them defend their capital city @entity79 from waves of @entity3 fighters this summer			1
@entity25 military officials declined to discuss @entity14 's presence in @entity45 , or in previous victories where he is known to have played a commanding role			2
there have also been reports that , fighting alongside @entity14 , troops from the @entity90 branch of @entity52 have also been involved			1
powerful @entity92 militias have also sided with @entity14 and @entity52 and have helped to drive @entity69 away from the so - called @entity94 belt - a ring of villages surrounding the @entity25 capital			1
victorious : @entity25 federal policemen pose outside @entity100 after claiming victory against @entity3			0
while their government has been keen to take credit , military sources say it was @entity14 who led them into victory @entity92 forces : fighting alongside @entity14 are said to be troops from @entity15 - back @entity52 , and powerful @entity92 militias , causing concern among the @entity112 locals this will come as good news to the @entity25 prime minister , @entity116 , and the @entity117 , as they seek to rebuild @entity4 's shattered army and build up their own national guard forces to strike against @entity3			1
however , the presence of strong @entity92 forces - including @entity14 and @entity52 - in the mostly @entity112 villages around @entity94 is causing concern			1
there are fears of atrocities against the natives if the situation is not properly controlled , sparking a new wave of violence across the country			0
the @entity92 militias have long been implicated in brutality against @entity112 , and their advance could also undermine efforts to knit the troubled country together			1
their members were widely implicated in atrocities across the bloody years of 2006 and 2007 , and have been accused of violence against @entity112 captives in more recent times			2
while @entity15 - backed @entity52 are openly fighting with @entity144 in @entity145 , the organisation will oonly admit to having ' advisers ' in @entity4 , breeding suspicion as to their intentions			2
in july , officials in @entity90 said a @entity52 commander was killed while on a ' jihadi mission ' in @entity4			0
@entity151 was buried in @entity90 and his funeral attended by top @entity52 officials			0
it was the first known @entity52 death in @entity4 since the lightning is advance in june			0
a @entity90 official close to the group said @entity52 is known to have ' a limited number of advisers ' in @entity4 who are not directly involved in fighting , and that @entity163 was one of them			0
bloodshed : @entity92 troops have long been implicated in violence against @entity112 villagers , and have been accused of abducting and killing civilians in recent months as the @entity25 government watched on @entity25 officials have also said that a handful of advisers from @entity52 , which is backed by @entity15 , are offering front - line guidance to @entity25 @entity92 militias fighting @entity112 extremists north of @entity94			1
but it is not known if any @entity52 men are actually fighting			0
these forces have benefited from @entity180 airstrikes aimed at weakening @entity3 forces on the ground			0
with @entity4 's military still licking its wounds from a summer of heavy defeats , many fear this has created a power vacuum for the @entity92 forces to move into			0
@entity190 said last month that militias have abducted and killed scores of @entity112 civilians with the tacit support of the @entity25 government in retaliation for @entity69 attacks			1
@entity4 's prime minister @entity116 has pledged to reign in the militias and establish a national guard to mobilize @entity112 against the extremists			2
but it could take months to assemble such a force , and in the meantime @entity202 's militias are the best placed to aid @entity4 's beleaguered military in regaining the initiative against the @entity69 group			2
@entity15 and @entity4 both have a majority @entity92 population - though @entity112 are more widely spread in @entity4 - and have a troubled history			1
under the leadership of @entity4 went to war with @entity15 in wake of the @entity15 revolution in 1979			0
the bloody conflict lasted eight years , included the use of chemical weapons , and ended in a stalemate .			0

@entity14 has been leading troops in @entity4 to victories against @entity3
fights alongside @entity53 and troops from @entity52
also *joined* by @entity92 militias as they drive @entity69 away from @entity94
but presence of @entity92 troops is causing concern among @entity112 villagers
accused of killing civilians as threat of new waves of violence grows
