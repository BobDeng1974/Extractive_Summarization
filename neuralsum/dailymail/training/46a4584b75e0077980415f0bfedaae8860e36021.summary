by @entity0 a tv star is trying to keep sensational claims of sexual misconduct made against her by a former employee secret because she is ‘ a well - known media personality ’ , it can be revealed			1
the blonde celebrity , who is a household name , is being accused by the ex-sales director of her company of sacking him because he rejected her sexual advances			1
the explosive claim is one of several allegations , including that she wore provocative clothing , made inappropriate sexual comments and called the 39 - year - old employee ’s @entity19 fiancee a ‘ p * * * ’			1
the blonde female celebrity can not be named after a ruling by an employment tribunal over sexual misconduct claims ( picture posed by model ) the former senior executive will claim unfair dismissal against the celebrity and her company at an employment tribunal in @entity32 this week			1
but the celebrity ’s lawyers have successfully applied for a reporting restriction to be granted , meaning neither she nor the executive can be named			1
the @entity37 has learned that the woman ’s lawyers argued that , because sexual misconduct allegations were being made , if her identity was made public , regardless of the outcome of the tribunal , her reputation would be irreparably damaged			1
in addition , it might jeopardise her charity work and her status as a ‘ well - known media personality ’			1
it is understood that the employee , who worked for her for six months , will allege that the celebrity , who is in her 50s , said she ‘ only employed good - looking men ’ and that she made inappropriate comments about the employee ’s looks in front of clients			1
the employee was invited on two foreign work trips , which he did not attend , as the celebrity ’s ‘ personal chaperone ’ and he was asked if he wanted to join her on a visit to the @entity67			1
furthermore , the celebrity – who lives with her partner – confided in the employee that she was having an affair and once tried to set him up on a date with a celebrity friend of hers			2
it is understood that the respondents deny the allegations and will contest them at the tribunal			0
@entity81 mp @entity80 said he was concerned by the privacy ruling as ' secrecy normally acts to conceal the truth over time ' a source told @entity37 last night : ‘ she ’s doing everything she can to stop this from coming out			2
it ’s just not right			0
she ’s an absolute nightmare and when she eventually realised nothing was ever going to happen , she got rid of him			0
’ when @entity37 spoke to the employment tribunal on friday afternoon they confirmed that a reporting restriction had been granted the previous day			2
asked for an explanation , an employee said : ‘ because it involves an allegation of sexual misconduct			1
when it comes to that we do n’t name the parties			0
’ but the names of claimants and respondents are usually reported in employment tribunals involving sexual discrimination and harassment			2
the listings for upcoming tribunals are freely available and members of the press and public are allowed to attend			0
there is a presumption of open justice unless naming a particular party would put the case at risk			2
the government has introduced fees for tribunals to weed out claims designed to embarrass former employers			0
@entity81 mp @entity80 said : ‘ these cases worry me			0
i ’m not sure that it ’s a reasonable route to take			0
‘ i ’m very uncomfortable with secrecy being used , because secrecy normally acts to conceal the truth over time			0
i do n’t think that in any way the argument that someone is well known justifies keeping their name secret			0
