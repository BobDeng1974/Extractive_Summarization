by @entity1 reporter @entity2 has blasted a @entity4 film critic who claimed his recent criticism of gentrification in @entity7 was hypocritical because he lives on @entity9 's @entity8			1
the filmmaker delivered an expletive - filled lecture at @entity12 for @entity13 in february about white ' hipsters ' acting like @entity16 and ' kill ( ing ) off the @entity18 ' in the borough			1
commenting on the 7 minute rant , @entity20 wrote in sunday 's @entity4 : ' as is often the case with mr. @entity2 's public utterances , this one was a mixture of hyperbole , provocation and plain truth ... what 's the saying about people who live in glass brownstones ? ' but the article incensed @entity2 so much that he penned an open letter monday to the critic defending his @entity7 credentials and his ability to comment on the changing face of the borough despite moving away			1
' you stated in your @entity50 that because i live in the @entity8 and i 'm talking about @entity52 that makes me hypocrite			2
the fact is where i live has nothing to do with it			0
' critic : commenting on the 7 minute rant , @entity20 , pictured , wrote in sunday 's @entity4 that it was hypercritical he went on : ' @entity61 is @entity61			1
the truth is @entity63 ... @entity61 is @entity52 is great for the @entity64 in @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 and @entity70 , and in many other cities across the @entity72 but not so great for the @entity73 and @entity74 who have been in these neighborhoods for decades and are being forced out , to the @entity76 , down @entity66 or back to their @entity77			0
' outlining his @entity7 background , he explains that his family moved from his native @entity81 to settle in @entity82 when he was 3			0
he said his parents bought their first home in 1968 in @entity70 , where his father still lives			0
' mr. @entity20 , what you fail to understand is that i can live on @entity89 and what i said is still true			0
no matter where i choose to live that has nothing to do with it			0
i will always carry @entity7 in my @entity94			0
' comparing himself to rapper @entity96 , who has @entity7 roots but now resides in @entity98 , @entity2 wrote : ' did anyone call @entity96 a @entity100 when he helped with bringing the @entity101 from @entity102 to the @entity103 in @entity7 at the corner of @entity105 and @entity106 ? ' @entity107 , @entity96 had been long , long gone from the @entity108 and @entity7 a long , long , long time ago and more power to my @entity110			1
should @entity96 no longer mention @entity7 in his songs because he no longer resides there ? ' films : many of @entity2 's films including 1989 's @entity115 , pictured , were filmed in @entity7 he then ranted about all the movies he 's made and that , by @entity20 's logic , he should n't have written and directed the films because he did n't live in the neighborhoods where they were set			1
in a final assault , he concluded the letter by listing many @entity7 natives who still hold the borough dear despite living elsewhere now			2
' it does n't matter where you choose to live because @entity7 goes where you go , ' he wrote			2
' it still lives inside @entity130 , @entity131 , @entity132 , @entity133 and @entity134 , @entity135 , @entity136 , @entity137 , @entity138 , @entity139 ( and ) @entity140 , ' and the list went on before signing off from ' @entity142 of @entity7 , @entity143			2
