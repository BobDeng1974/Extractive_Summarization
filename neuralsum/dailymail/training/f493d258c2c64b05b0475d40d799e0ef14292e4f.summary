by @entity0 fight promoter @entity1 shocked the world of boxing yesterday by revealing he is undergoing a sex change			2
wearing a wig , lipstick , dress and heels , the 61 - year - old now lives as a woman called @entity11			1
the former boxing manager , who guided @entity13 to the world heavyweight title , retired in october – claiming she had fallen out of love with the sport			1

under @entity40 guidelines , transsexuals have to live as a woman for two years before they are allowed corrective surgery			1
so far the process has involved secret hormone therapy , hours of hair removal electrolysis , voice coaching and counselling			2
speaking to the @entity48 , @entity1 said : ‘ i was n’t born into the right body , i have always known i was a woman			1
turmoil : the 61 - year - old admits the pressure and confusion caused by her struggles with her identity caused battles with drink , depression and drugs out and about : @entity62 , the 61 - year - old former promoter in june @entity11 says she kept her turmoil in the shadows because she feared a backlash from the notoriously macho world of boxing			1
top of their game : @entity1 ( in @entity71 suit ) , right , with @entity73 @entity72 , left , in @entity74 in october 1997 living a lie : @entity1 ( left , as a man in 1998 ) admitted she has felt trapped in a man 's body since she was a child			1
@entity80 , @entity13 and @entity1 in 1989			1
they would go on to reach the very peak of boxing ‘ living with the burden any longer would have killed me			1
the feeling of wanting to be like and dress like a woman has always been there			1
‘ i consciously made the decision that i would n’t dress like a woman , but it was a constant urge			1
’ @entity1 , who was known for wearing @entity71 suits , said it would have been impossible to tell anyone in the macho world of boxing – despite making the careers of @entity98 and @entity100 champions such as cruiserweight title holder @entity101			2
‘ can you imagine me walking into a boxing hall dressed as a woman and putting an event on ? i can imagine what they would scream at me , ’ she revealed			1
‘ but if they had been in the theatre or arts world nobody would blink an eye about this transition			1
’ @entity1 , who had a box at @entity117 , described how he told second wife @entity118 , 47 , about the transition at their home in @entity122 , south - east @entity123			1
‘ we were standing in the kitchen and i said , “ i have to tell you i have lived with this all my life			2
i have lived a lie and i really am a female in my head ” , ’ she said			2
the promoters : @entity133 ( right ) , promoting @entity134 , with @entity1 , manager of @entity73 champion @entity13 in 1998 ‘ as the words started to come out i wanted to catch them and pull them back in			1
i looked at her face and i knew my marriage was over			2
‘ i went upstairs and i broke down			2
she came up and i told her i was going to our house abroad			2
‘ i was not happy when the relationship ended			0
it had been a security net around me			0
but it was the first step of me starting life as a woman			1
’ @entity1 insists she does n’t want a new relationship			0
born in @entity153 , @entity123 , the former promoter has been politically active in the past			0
in 2004 , @entity1 stood as an independent during the @entity123 mayoral vote and was the @entity157 candidate in @entity158 , @entity159 , at the 2010 general election			0
yesterday , a number of boxers expressed their support			0
former @entity165 cruiserweight champion @entity164 said : ‘ ignorance is the problem of others , not yours			0
’ former welterweight champion @entity170 added : ‘ he ’s still a top guy , so i do n’t care			0
’ and @entity13 posted on @entity174 : ‘ this world we live in is n’t always cut and dried or black and white , and coming from the boxing fraternity , i can only imagine what a difficult decision this must be for @entity11			1
’ yesterday both @entity1 and wife @entity118 both declined to comment			0
by @entity178 transgender writer and campaigner while many might be shocked by @entity1 ’s transition into @entity11 , it comes as no surprise to me			1
there ’s no rule which says that hairdressers are more likely to be transgender than sporting professionals			0
if anything , the opposite holds true			0
there is so much blame and shame about being transgender that many will do all they can to hide it – often taking up careers that exaggerate their birth gender			0
so men may be more macho and women more feminine			0
it can make the transition more of a shock to other people , but not to those who have been through it			1
for me , that was four years ago			0
happily settled with my partner of seven years and two young children , i decided aged 52 that i could no longer live as a man and needed to become ‘ @entity212 ’			2
support often arrives from unexpected directions			0
i was working as a science and technology writer , and the atmosphere in the office was laddish			0
i dreaded returning to work as @entity212 , but i was surprised and grateful for the nonchalant way my male colleagues reacted			0
one said of my painted nails ‘ the colour does n’t suit you ’ , while the rest just got on with work as usual			0
my partner stood by me			0
and that ’s how it should be			0
my heart goes out to @entity11			1
transition opens the door to public abuse and discrimination – but for some people changing gender is necessary , and my own experience shows it can lead to happiness .			2

@entity13 ' former mentor , 61 , now lives as a woman called @entity11
he said he is now more than a year into a two - year transition period
' living with burden any longer would have killed me ' , he said
