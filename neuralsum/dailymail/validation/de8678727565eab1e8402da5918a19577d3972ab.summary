@entity0 has banned the broadcast of a controversial documentary in which one of the men who gang - raped and murdered a student is shown blaming the victim - a move the film 's maker called ' arbitrary censorship '			1
home minister @entity11 told @entity0 's parliament on wednesday the comments of @entity14 , one of five men convicted over the 2012 attack in @entity17 , were ' highly derogatory and an affront to the dignity of women '			1
' the government condemns it , ' he said of the documentary made by award - winning @entity26 film - maker @entity24 , who won rare access to @entity17 's @entity30 jail to interview the prisoner on death row			1
@entity14 's comments in the @entity49 , @entity0 's upper house , came after a @entity17 court late tuesday issued an order banning media from showing the film , ' @entity0 's daughter '			1
the reasons for the court ban were not immediately clear , but some in @entity0 have expressed concern that a convicted rapist was being given a platform for his views			2
spokesman @entity63 said the @entity17 police had petitioned the court for a ban on the grounds that the film 's ' objectionable content ' could cause public disorder			2
the physiotherapy student died from her injuries 13 days after she was savagely attacked on a bus while on her way home from the cinema			1
the incident triggered violent protests in @entity0			2
it highlighted the frightening level of violence against women in the world 's second most populous country and led to a major reform of @entity0 's rape laws , speeding up trials and increasing penalties			1
@entity0 's @entity90 network was due to have shown the documentary to mark @entity92 on sunday , when it will also be broadcast in six other countries including @entity26			1
@entity94 said she was heart - broken by the ban on the documentary , in which @entity14 said the 23 - year - old victim was to blame for her own death			1
he said : ' a girl is far more responsible for rape than a boy			0
a decent girl wo n't roam around at 9 o'clock at night ...			0
housework and housekeeping is for girls , not roaming in discos and bars at night doing wrong things , wearing wrong clothes			0
' the woman and her friend were returning home from seeing a movie at an upscale mall when they were tricked by the men into getting on the bus , which they 'd taken out for a joyride			0
the attackers beat her friend and took turns raping the woman			0
they penetrated her with a rod , leaving severe internal injuries that caused her death			0
@entity14 , who was driving the bus , added : ' she should just be silent and allow the rape			1
' police officers escort @entity14 , one of the men convicted of the gang - rape and murder of an @entity0 student , outside the @entity134 in @entity17 , on september 24 , 2013 ' i am sure , positive , that @entity90 will fight this arbitrary censorship all the way , because it is an organisation that stands up for values , for public welfare and for the greater good , ' she told @entity141			1
' @entity0 is a country that values its rights and one of the most important of them is the freedom of speech , expression and that needs to be upheld			0
' @entity94 said earlier she had permission from both prison authorities and the home ministry to film inside the vast @entity30 in @entity17 for her documentary			2
but home minister @entity14 said she had violated the terms of the agreement by not showing the complete unedited footage to jail officials			1
the documentary divided lawmakers on wednesday , with many applauding the ban but others saying @entity0 must confront views such as the rapist 's - however abhorrent			2
' banning this movie is not the answer , ' said @entity164 , an independent mp			0
' we have to confront the issue that men in @entity0 do not respect women and any time there is a rape , blame is put on the woman			2
' no one at the @entity90 network could immediately be reached for comment on the ban			0
but @entity94 said she believed the move would only serve to increase interest in her film			0
' the more they try to stop the film , the more they are going to pique people 's interest , ' she said			0
' now , everyone is going to want to see it			0
' four men including @entity14 were sentenced to death for the crime , but their execution was later stayed on appeal by @entity0 's @entity192			1
one of the defendants hanged himself in prison , while another , who was under 18 at the time , got three years in juvenile detention			0
