there 's nothing too flash about captain @entity3 's bridge room			2
but it 's about the only only spot on the massive cruise liner @entity6 left untouched by an $ 80million make over that has made it one of the most salubrious ships ever to set sail			1
whether it 's intentional or not , his office has quite evidently escaped the glitz and glamour of the @entity17 ' refurbished @entity16			2
despite his ship 's sparkling new interiors – which cost $ 80 million – it appears the captain 's commanding room was left untouched			2
the bridge room - with uninterrupted views of well , the sea – has a classic old school feel but a touch of retro with its soft velvet blue lounges and traditional navigation gadgets to an intriguing scooter sitting in the middle of the room			2
up on deck 10 of the biggest ship to sail in @entity38 , this is what can be considered the best seat in the house			0
then there 's the world 's first smart ship - quantum of the seas which cost $ 1billion - complete with a robot bar and a skydiving simulator			1
@entity48 gained behind - the - scenes access to two of these revolutionary cruise liners			1
aboard the exclusive part of the ship , just outside the bridge room , hangs a collage of landscapes which capture @entity82 's natural beauty – the home of captain @entity3			0
what 's notably different about the captain 's room from the rest of the luxurious ship is an apt and simple colour scheme of sea blue carpet , curtains , lounges and ceilings			0
the room lets the wall - to - wall windows do all the talking , taking advantage of the panoramic water views which are stunning from this part of the deck			0
although for security reasons not too much was revealed on the background of the bridge room , there was one particular feature that stood out from the rest			0
the scooter , with a plaque engraved ' captain ' on the front , holds historic value			0
it was gifted by the ship yard in @entity114 that built the @entity6 back in 1999 , hence is just as old as the vessel itself			2
having taken over the reigns of the ship since then - back in 2002 - captain @entity3 is proud of the @entity6 and how far it 's come over the years			1
the ship sailed from @entity74 through to @entity122 , @entity123 and then @entity75 @entity124 's @entity6 set sail for the first time since its $ 80million makeover for a 14 - day journey and arrived in @entity75 on monday a view of the top deck of the @entity6 , featuring one its newest and main attractions the @entity132 - a surf pool the @entity134 in the ship , which features high end stores , was also part of the major refurbishment captain @entity3 , of @entity82 , pictured in the ship 's bridge room during the journey to @entity75 most of the bridge was left untouched despite the major refurbishment of the vessel the scooter hold historic value as it was gifted by a ship yard in @entity114 when the vessel was first built in 1999 the bridge has a classic old school feel with an apt yet simple colour scheme of sea blue carpet , ceilings , lounges and curtains the 50 - year - old spoke to @entity48 just before his vessel ended its first trip in @entity75 since its major makeover			1

' it 's something that all @entity186 dream of being and i come from three generations of captains			0
' while the new and improved cruise liner boasts the addition of three specialty restaurants and a mammoth poolside cinema to virtual ocean views from staterooms and new pool surfing attraction called the @entity132 - captain @entity3 remained unfazed that his office merely underwent a few upgrades to the bridge facilities and was also recarpeted			1
