local boy @entity0 inspired @entity1 to the perfect start at their new @entity4 home with a record premiership points haul that helped sink their former @entity7 rivals			1
the 34 - year @entity1 fly half , who was born in @entity10 and attended the city ’s king henry viii school , produced a superb display to collect eight penalties , two conversions and a second - half try that brought him 33 points — one better than the previous best shared by @entity19 ( @entity20 , 1998 ) , @entity21 ( @entity22 , 2000 ) and @entity23 ( @entity24 , 2002 )			1
with a record home crowd of 28,254 in attendance and gate receipts in excess of £ 500,000 , things really could not have gone any better on or off the field for the new team in town			2
@entity0 ( right ) is mobbed by his @entity1 team - mates after he crossed for a try at the @entity4 @entity0 broke the @entity20 line to claim his touchdown during his side 's emphatic 48 - 16 victory @entity0 successfully kicks one of eight penalties on his way to a 33 - point haul at the @entity4 ‘ it sounds a bit cheesy but that ’s what dreams are made of , ’ said @entity0 , a lifelong @entity43 fan			1
‘ it could n’t have gone any better			0
i did n’t sleep that well last night			0
‘ i ’ve been up here a fair few times to watch @entity43 play but to run out on the field was unbelievable			2
‘ i got a hammering from my little girl for missing five kicks last week ( against @entity56 )			0
she made me change my boots and everything			0
' as i came off the field she was there and she said , “ you ’re keeping those boots forever , @entity64 ”			0
’ there were clear first - half nerves , not least from rookie referee @entity67 , whose whistle threatened to ruin any hope of a fluid game			1
@entity0 took advantage with unerring accuracy , kicking six penalties in the first 40 minutes after @entity74 prop @entity75 had briefly threatened to spoil @entity1 ’ party with an opportunist try for the visitors on 16 minutes @entity79 bursts free before setting up @entity1 scrum half @entity80 to score @entity82 is congratulated by his team - mates after scoring one of @entity1 ' four tries against the @entity74 @entity1 pulled away in spectacular fashion in the second half with @entity80 ’s try opening the floodgates before @entity20 hooker @entity90 was sinbinned			1
@entity1 took full advantage with three tries to seal an all - important bonus point			1
@entity0 , @entity94 and @entity95 all crossed as @entity1 moved above @entity96 and @entity24 into sixth in the @entity99 table			1
just as importantly , the club which so nearly went bankrupt last season finally appears to have found a home			2
@entity1 full back @entity95 crashes over his side 's final try during the rout of @entity20 players from both teams receive a warm welcome ahead of @entity1 ' first game at the @entity4 in @entity10 @entity113 ’s @entity112 felt a long way away in every sense by the time @entity67 blew his final whistle			1
the only concern was the worrying manner in which the pitch cut up during the course of the afternoon			0
no doubt fans of @entity43 will be keeping a close eye on that situation			0
‘ it was a big occasion for everybody but i ’d have taken that before the game , ’ said @entity1 director of rugby @entity124			2
‘ there was some emotion about beforehand			0
but the bonus point was the icing on the cake			0
