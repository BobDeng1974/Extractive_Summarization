by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity2 believes @entity3 to be the surprise of the @entity6 season - and now the benchmark for @entity8 to aspire to			1
come the start of the campaign , rumours implied @entity3 had adapted more to the new regulations compared to fellow power - train suppliers @entity8 and @entity14			1
but it is fair to assume no - one expected @entity3 to blow away their rivals as they have done this season and usurp @entity19 as the force to beat			2
falling behind : @entity2 has been left behind by @entity3 this season with @entity8 runner up : the @entity22 finished second in @entity23 , and is yet to win a race yet this season from the 11 grands prix 's over the first period of the season , @entity3 team - mates @entity25 and @entity27 have claimed 10 poles and won nine races between them			1
with eight grand prix 's to run once f1 returns from its summer break later this month , it is simply a question of when and not if @entity3 will win the constructors ' championship and one of their drivers the main prize			0
' @entity3 have surprised everybody , ' said double world champion @entity2			1
' now we are getting used to seeing them dominate every weekend , but i remember when we were in @entity48 and @entity49 testing these new cars with very complex technology			0
' we were all struggling , but straight away they were okay , and now from 11 races they 've won nine and nearly always been on the front row			1
' i would say they have been the biggest surprise - a good surprise - this year			2
' leading the way : @entity25 and @entity27 ( left ) of @entity3 have lead the way this season challengers : the team - mates and rivals have won nine of the 11 races so far this season by contrast , @entity2 has again driven beyond the capabilities of his car , hauling himself on to the podium twice in the 11 events			1
consequently , both he and @entity8 have nothing much to play for other than being the best of the rest , albeit with the determination to one day soon be battling @entity3 for honours			0
' @entity3 are motivation for us , ' added @entity2			2
' we know we can do a much better job as we have n't done a good one so far			0
' we are making some progress , but the benchmark has changed - last year it was @entity19 , this year it 's @entity3			0
' we simply have to get on top of our problems and try to arrive at their level			0
