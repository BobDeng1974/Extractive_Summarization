@entity1 is still an excellent player who can make the difference for @entity3 but from what i ’ve seen of him over the past 10 games or so , he has forgotten about the player he used to be			1
having been given the captaincy , i think he was trying to be disciplined and focused on wednesday and he has got to release that a little and play with some of the energy and freedom of old			2
he probably did n’t realise it but on wednesday he got stuck in the inside - left position			2
when the wingers come in , he ’s then got to float out and play wider			2
he never really read that situation			2
tough times : @entity1 has struggled to find his best form for @entity3 in recent matches all smiles : @entity1 chats with @entity19 as @entity3 prepare to take on @entity20 on monday and he ’s getting pinned down a bit in one position			1
when he was younger , he was making movements off the ball much more			1
he ’s becoming a player who wants the ball to his feet too much and to play passes			1
i think he has a mind block			2
someone has to show him video of the movement he made when he was younger and the space he created for others			0
it ’s a pattern and it ’s something he has to look at			0
it ’s not because of fitness ; he ’s still fit enough to make those runs			0
he just has to mix his game up			0
coaches have to identify these things and make sure players see them			0
in the old days , you had to rely on the coach ’s eye			0
these days it ’s easier , because you have so much evidence in terms of stats and videos and analysis which can show exactly where you have received the ball and when			1
during the @entity54 , i raised the possibility of him dropping into midfield and long - term that ’s a very real possibility for @entity3 and @entity60			1
spot on : @entity1 scored the only goal of the game against @entity63 as @entity3 edged to a nervy win time for a change ? @entity1 could be deployed in midfield by @entity3 and @entity60 @entity60 played with @entity67 and @entity68 as offensive midfielders against @entity70 and i can see @entity1 in that role			1
and if nobody grasps the midfield area for @entity3 , i can see him going deeper there , too			1
coming on to the play from deeper might suit him , as you have space to run into			0
playing as a floating striker , you can end up with your back to goal an awful lot			1
for now , though , he will play as a centre forward and it ’s important he gets back to his best			0
he seems to be taking the captaincy very , very seriously			0
and there are responsibilities off the pitch , but we do n’t want that to affect him on the pitch			0
we want him to have pride in the job but we do n’t want him to think he has to change the way he plays			0
he needs to be a mover of the ball , playing passes that will hurt teams			1
he needs to mix his game up			0
we want the @entity1 of old .			1

@entity1 has forgotten about the player he used to be
he has become a player who wants the ball to his feet too often
playing in midfield is a real possibility for @entity3 and @entity60
