@entity1 joked about his prowess on the dance floor and how @entity11 and @entity4 have picked up the skill during a wide - ranging interview with the magazine @entity14			1
the heir to the throne also spoke of his joy at the warm reception the @entity19 received from @entity20 last year			1
the @entity1 , pictured here in a disco dancing session in @entity23 in 1992 , claims that sons @entity11 and @entity4 inherited their dancing skills from him @entity1 hit the @entity26 with @entity27 during a visit to @entity29 , @entity30 last year , but says at his age he dances less prince @entity4 showed off his moves when he was invited to dance by @entity33 , when he visited @entity34 , a youth charity project in @entity36 , @entity37 last year @entity1 and @entity38 made their first official visit to the country as a couple last november , and the royal described his delight after wellwishers realised she was ' an incredibly good sort '			1
the royal was first interviewed by the magazine in 1974 when , aged 26 , he declared , ' if i hear rhythmic music , i just want to get up and dance			0
' the @entity3 and @entity52 visited @entity53 and danced with the ladies at the @entity55 asked by the publication 's deputy editor @entity56 if he still felt the beat , @entity1 , who became a grandfather for the first time in july , repled : ' perhaps , it 's slightly less becoming once you get to my age			1
' he added : ' i think given half a chance though , the old one - two and the two - step can come in handy			1
i 'm glad to say that both my sons have inherited it , i think			0
' they 're very good			2
they do make me laugh when they get going			2
' the @entity3 clearly amused his wife as he demonstrated his ' swagger ' dance moves with @entity80 during a reception at @entity83 's @entity82 in @entity84 in 2011 it is easy to see why prince @entity4 makes his father laugh when he ' gets going ' on the dance floor when you see him dancing with local women during a walkabout at a ' block party ' in @entity92 , @entity93 , @entity94 during the @entity96 world tour @entity4 was spotted dancing numerous times during his @entity96 tour of the @entity99 last year - especially in @entity36 when he visited a charity			1
and when @entity1 and @entity38 travelled to @entity30 at the end of their @entity96 tour , they both strutted their stuff with different partners on a pop - up dancefloor in @entity29			1
asked if he was passing his wisdom on to @entity11 and @entity4 , @entity1 suggested his sons had learnt from him - but wanted to keep it a secret			1
@entity1 , seen here trying his hand at @entity112 dancing at a state banquet in 1999 in @entity114 , says even nowadays ' the old one - two and the two - step can come in handy ' he said : ' well , i do n't know			1
how do you know ? you can try , but no , i 've always believed i just do what i do and i hope that they might notice something			0
' i mean , funnily enough , i do n't see what they 're up to when i 'm not there , but sometimes i hear back from others that they 're surprisingly similar in some ways ( to me )			0
so maybe some things rub off ... which they would n't want me to know			0
' speaking about last year 's @entity20 visit , which marked the @entity129 , the prince told the women 's magazine : ' before you go , you wonder what is the reaction going to be - it 's always the same			1
but it was wonderful that they took to her and saw her for what she is - an incredibly good sort			2
the @entity1 and @entity140 dance together in 1985 at the @entity142 's @entity141 in @entity143			2
@entity140 made a lasting impression on @entity20 during numerous visits ' she loved it and has such incredibly happy memories of her experience and , obviously , i was thrilled , as you can imagine , for @entity20 to discover just how special she is ... because she 's got the most wonderful sense of humour and has some very good jokes			1
' @entity1 ' first wife @entity140 made a lasting impression on @entity20 during numerous visits and the @entity19 appears to have also won the affections of many people in the country			1
the first stop for the royals during their tour was the remote outback settlement of @entity163 and @entity38 endeared herself to the locals by cuddling a 12 - month - old kangaroo			1
the prince still has fond memories of his first visit to @entity20 , made in 1966 when he was aged 17			2
when the royal couple visited the outback settlement of @entity163 and @entity38 endeared herself to the locals by cuddling a 12 - month - old kangaroo , called @entity173 the royal spent two terms in the @entity20 outback at @entity177 , an off - shoot of @entity177 in @entity143 , on a private exchange from @entity180			1
during the visit the prince said he plucked up the courage to really talk to the public and learnt to communicate with wellwishers			0
speaking about the crowds that had come out to see him @entity1 said : ' then , of course , finally , i took the plunge and went over and talked to people , and that suddenly unlocked a completely different feeling and i was then able to communicate and talk to people so much more			2
' while at @entity177 , 100 miles from @entity143 , the prince joined the other pupils who had to fend for themselves and complete expeditions into the surrounding hills			0
he said : ' there were leeches and snakes , and those enormous bull ants and funnel web spiders i 've never forgotten			0
and then waking up in your tent and you 're frozen stiff in the frost			0
' i never imagined that would happen in that part of the world - or all these strange creepy crawlies wanting to do you mischief			0
but it was jolly good for the character and , in many ways , i loved it and i learnt a lot from it			0
and i certainly discovered what good value the @entity20 are			2
' speaking about the issues that motivate him the royal said that we had created a ' throwaway society '			0
he stressed that nations had to look after the natural world : ' what i 'm trying to say is there is another way of looking at this if we 're going to hand over to our children and grandchildren a planet that is n't totally degraded and compromised			0
you ca n't push nature beyond a certain limit			0
we have to look after it			0
' @entity1 and @entity38 made their first official visit to @entity20 as a couple last november , and the royal described his delight after wellwishers realised she was ' an incredibly good sort ' speaking about his views on balancing conventional medicine with complimentary treatments he said : ' i know lots of people who find they are n't benefited in every case by just the conventional , orthodox drug and finally discover that actually an approach - whether it 's herbal medicine or acupuncture or various other forms of complementary medicine - actually does benefit them			1
' there 's a lot that can be done on the preventative side			0
there 's an enormous amount we can do by looking at the whole person			0
' @entity1 also stressed that he wanted to see if some of his @entity266 charities could link up with @entity20 counterparts to tackle issues			1
one project already off the ground will see the @entity271 develop the ' @entity1 's @entity272 ' in @entity143			2
the development will be an update to the popular @entity20 terraced house , combining 21st century @entity20 lifestyle demands with the technology of today which aims to create a sustainable and eco-friendly living solution .			0
