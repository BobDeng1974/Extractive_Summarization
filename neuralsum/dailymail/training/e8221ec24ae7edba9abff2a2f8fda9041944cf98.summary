by @entity0 published : 11:17 est , 6 june 2012 updated : 11:17 est , 6 june 2012 the real culprit behind heart attacks and strokes is stem cells , researchers have claimed in a landmark study that could revolutionise treatment			1
until now , scientists thought vascular health problems were triggered by smooth muscle cells			1
now a team from the @entity12 in @entity13 have found a previously unknown stem cell , which causes the arteries to harden when it multiplies			2
real hope : the cells can multiply and cause arteries to harden , blocking the blood 's route to the heart or brain the groundbreaking work is set to completely change how heart attacks and strokes are treated , dramatically cutting the number of deaths , according the study published today in the journal @entity30			1
heart attacks are the most common reason for people to need emergency treatment			2
around 90,000 people in @entity35 have one each year - of whom around a third will die as a result			2
more than 150,000 people a year have a stroke and it is the third largest cause of death after heart disease and cancer			0
strokes occur when the blood supply to part of the brain is cut off , while heart attacks happen when the supply of blood to the heart is blocked , usually by a blood clot			2
landmark moment : the discovery of the new type of stem cell could dramatically cut the number of deaths from strokes and heart attacks ' for the first time , we are showing evidence that vascular diseases are actually a kind of stem cell disease , ' said professor @entity65 , from the university			1
the build - up of artery - blocking plaque results from the body â€™s immune response to vessel damage			0
vessel damage is caused by low - density lipoproteins - the ' bad ' cholesterol many people try to eliminate from their diets			0
it attracts white blood cells , causing the formation of fibrous scar tissue , which narrows the blood flow			0
the scar tissue has certain characteristics of smooth muscle , the main type of tissue found in the blood vessel wall , but it is actually dormant stem cells that are activated and multiply			1
' this work should revolutionise therapies for vascular diseases because we now know that stem cells rather than smooth muscle cells are the correct therapeutic target			1
' ' this is groundbreaking and provocative work , as it challenges existing dogma , ' added his colleague dr @entity100			0
the newly discovered vascular stem cells are multipotent - or capable of changing into various cell types , including smooth muscle , nerve , cartilage , bone and fat cells - explaining why previous studies misidentified the cells involved in vessel clogs			1
' in the later stages of vascular disease , the soft vessels become hardened and more brittle , ' said professor @entity65			0
' previously , there was controversy about how soft tissue would become hard			0
the ability of stem cells to form bone or cartilage could explain this calcification of the blood vessels			0

scientists previously thought heart attacks and strokes were caused by smooth muscle cells
stem cells multiply and caused arteries to harden
heart attacks affect 90,000 and strokes 150,000 in @entity35 every year
