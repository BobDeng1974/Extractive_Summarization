moving on : @entity0 announced today her departure from @entity2			1
the 58 - year - old served as a co-anchor on the today show for just a year before she was replaced in june 2012 with the younger @entity6 @entity0 's toxic career at @entity2 is finally over			1
the former today co-anchor is leaving the network more than two years after her tearful last day on the morning show to start her own production company			1
' this is about reaching for the edge of the future in journalism , which we know is undergoing an irrevocable transition , ' @entity0 said in the statement			0
' in today ’s world of fragmented media , this is the time to seize the opportunity to improve the way we distribute and even tell stories			0
' i want to expand my drive to give voice to the voiceless to emerging platforms and produce both scripted and non-scripted content , in addition to continuing to report on - air about stories that matter			0
' @entity2 says they are helping finance @entity0 's new company , which will produce documentaries and special reports for news outlets			1
' we ’re proud to support @entity0 in her new venture , and we look forward to more of her exceptional storytelling , ' @entity45 chairman @entity44			0
' she is committed to uncovering critical issues , humanizing them , and ultimately helping viewers understand and connect			0
' @entity0 , 58 , has allegedly been in protracted negotiations with the network to end her contract , which is reportedly worth a lofty $ 12million			0
though her stint as today show anchor lasted just one year , she had been a reporter on the show for 15 years prior and was well liked by long - time viewers who reacted negatively to her abrupt dismissal in june 2012			1
long time coming : the news comes two and half years after @entity0 's last day on today in june 2012 , when she was pushed to tears having to announce she was being kicked off the show uncomfortable : @entity0 's terse reaction when @entity61 tried to comfort her with a kiss on the head fueled reports that he had a hand in her departure her last day , where she tearfully announced her premature today show retirement , marked the beginning of a dip in ratings for the ensuing months - worsening the cutthroat rivalry with @entity73			1
@entity0 's strained face as @entity61 leaned over for a comforting kiss on the cheek on her last day did not go unnoticed , and fueled reports that he sabotaged her career by demanding she be moved during his own contract negotiations			1
@entity6 , 43 , replaced @entity0 in the position			1
in an apparent attempt to save @entity61 's withering reputation , and @entity85 's ratings , then - executive producer @entity81 eventually took the blame for @entity0 's departure			1
@entity0 has spent most of her career at @entity2 , joining the network as a correspondent for @entity91 @entity90 in 1990			2
she rose quickly at the network and was promoted to a position in @entity94 , serving as a substitute news anchor for @entity61 from 1994 - 1997			0
when @entity61 left that position , @entity0 took over and became one of the longest - serving today news anchors in history , behind @entity100			2
in may 2005 , @entity0 transitioned to co-anchoring @entity2 with @entity101 , and later became the primary anchor when @entity101 left in june 2007			2
she continued anchoring @entity2 and filling in occasionally on @entity103 until she was made anchor at today in 2011			0
@entity0 is responsible for getting some of the most high - profile interviews the today show has seen during her period as news anchor and anchor			1
perhaps her most memorable was an interview with then @entity112 president @entity111 , just a few days before he traveled to the @entity114 to speak at the @entity115 in 2009			0
hypothetically , her most recent position as today show ' anchor - at - large ' and @entity103 contributor would have presented her the opportunity to land more exclusive interviews like this , but she has been rarely seen on the network these past two years			2
' @entity0 has been unhappy for a long time because she ’s basically doing nothing , while @entity2 is unhappy that she has been paid a lot of money to do nothing , ' a source at @entity2 told the @entity129			2
@entity0 is married to software executive @entity130 and the couple have two children .			0

the 58 - year - old @entity2 *veteran* co-anchored the today show for just one year before she was replaced by @entity6 , 43 , in june 2012
@entity0 's tearful last day marked the beginning a sharp decline in viewership for the morning show
@entity2 is now helping @entity0 start her own production company to make special reports and documentaries for news outlets
