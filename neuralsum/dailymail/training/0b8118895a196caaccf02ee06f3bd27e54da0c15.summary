@entity1 's head of design has hit out at the firm 's competition , accusing them of ' stealing ' its designs			2
sir @entity7 told the audience at the @entity9 in @entity10 his feelings on the matter were ' a bit harsh '			2
' i do n't see it as flattery , ' he said , ' i actually see it as theft			2
thankfully , his vision was refined for the @entity24			2
sir @entity7 said seeing knockoff designs made him think of the lengthy development cycle that went into producing the originals			0
' when you 're doing something for the first time , for example with the phone , and you do n't know it 's going to work , and you spend seven or eight years working on something , and then it 's copied â€” i have to be honest , the first thing i think is n't ' ooh , that was flattering			0
' all those weekends i could have had at home with my lovely family but did n't , but the flattery made up for it			0
' the designer was asked about @entity44 , a @entity46 firm which has been accused of copying @entity1 's style			0
not an @entity24 : the @entity48 6 handset , which many have said is simply a copy of the @entity24 the firm 's latest software and handset looks extremely similar to @entity1 's @entity54 software			0
the designer also gave a rare insight into how his team works , revealing there are just 16 or 17 people			1
' it 's grown steadily over the last 15 years , ' he said			0
' we 've worked hard to keep it small			0
sir @entity7 spoke with @entity9 editor @entity63 in a rare interview ' one of the advantages of being part of a design team that 's been around for a long time is we 've had the luxury to develop our process			1
' we meet three or four times a week			1
' the designers gather around the same kind of tablets you see in @entity77			0
' we stand around those tables ... and we draw			0
it really galvanizes and focuses our team			1
' he also spoke about the team 's work on @entity84			1
' @entity85 was the most focused person i 've met in my life			1
' it 's terrifying that when you really truly focus , it seems a bit illegal			0
' you can achieve so much			0
' what focus means is saying no with every bone in your body to something you know is a good idea but you say no because you 're focused on something else			1
i remember talking to @entity100 and asked why he was perceived as harsh			1
' and i said could n't we be more moderate ? and he said why ? and i said because i care about the team			1
' and he said : ' no jony , you 're just really vain			0
you just want people to like you			1
i 'm surprised at you , because i thought you really held the work up as the most important and not how you are perceived by people			2
'' ' people misunderstand @entity85 because he was so focused ' ' on the @entity84 , there were many technologies that started with the ' what if ' and ' how do we do this ? he revealed			1
' it 's a really great place to be able to glance quickly at information			2
' when we started working on it , it seemed like a natural place for technology to end up			1

*admits* team almost gave us on the idea of a *touchscreen* device several times
tiny team of sixteen meets around large *wooden* table and draws
says watch is a ' natural place for technology to end up '
*claims* people misunderstand @entity100 because he was so focused
