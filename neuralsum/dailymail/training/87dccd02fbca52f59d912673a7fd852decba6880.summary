former @entity1 star @entity0 is planning to challenge @entity2 for the presidency of football 's world governing body @entity7 with a campaign launch planned for friday in @entity9			1
but whether the 47 - year - old @entity10 has any realistic chance of getting the support he needs even to enter the race - let alone becoming the most powerful man in football - is in doubt			1
the seriousness of his bid is also sure to be called into question because his launch is being co-ordinated by bookmakers @entity21 - famous for brilliant pr stunts to advertise their business but not associated with significant campaigns in sports politics			2

by january 29 he needs to prove to @entity7 that he has played an ' active role ' in football for at least two of the last five years - a condition for candidates			1

' football belongs to the people and they deserve to have a voice			0
we want transparency so that everyone knows where every penny goes			0

' i 'm always being asked questions about what is needed to change @entity7			2
well now i 'm going to do something about it			0
