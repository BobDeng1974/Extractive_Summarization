by @entity1 reporter it was an image posted on @entity3 by a seemingly trustworthy source that appeared to capture the on - going heartache suffered by so many in @entity6			1
and within hours it been retweeted thousands of times			0
but now it has emerged a picture of a four - year - old boy called @entity12 wandering in the desert , separated from his family , may have been misleading			1
in fact , he was n't alone at all - he was just a little way behind a large group of people			1
the picture was initially put on @entity3 by @entity20 , the @entity21 representative to @entity22 , who took the picture			2
it was only when @entity38 , the @entity39 news anchor , put it up with the caption ' crossing the desert alone after being separated from family fleeing @entity6 ' that interest in the story took hold			1
now a wider shot of the scene has emerged taken by @entity49 , a @entity21 photographer			0
it shows several hundred refugees , streaming over the border from @entity6 to @entity22			2
and , @entity12 stumbling over the desert ground , just a few meters off to the side			2

it is unclear how long the boy was separated from his family			2
a reporter tweeted on monday evening that a @entity21 official said @entity12 was only 20 steps behind his family after he became lost during the confusion of the crossing			1
nonetheless , the picture of the isolated boy has struck a chord , perhaps because it serves as a reminder of the many young children who have lost or become separated from their families due to the conflict			1
the picture of @entity12 was one in a series of pictures posted by mr @entity20 in the last few months , as the aid worker documents the ‘ endless tide ’ of refugees fleeing @entity6 into @entity22			1

approximately 2.5 million people have been forced to flee @entity6 since the civil conflict began three years ago an aerial shot of the @entity144 camp shows the sprawling refugee city			1

picture of @entity12 , four , who was found by @entity63 workers wandering the desert , may be misleading
the close cropped image shows him seemingly separated from his family
but a second wider picture has emerged showing the boy just metres from a large group of people
it *suggests* the child was n't alone as was *suggested* by a @entity39 reporter on @entity3
the little boy , one of a million children forced to flee @entity6 since the conflict began , was reunited with his mother
