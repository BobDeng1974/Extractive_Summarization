a 27 - year - old woman in @entity2 , @entity0 has filmed herself berating @entity4 employees in an apparent attempt to exact some kind of consumer justice			1
@entity8 , however , only succeeds in appearing rude , ignorant and racist in the video , which she posted on her @entity12 page			1
the imagined slight occurred the night prior , when a @entity4 employee apparently forgot to print @entity8 's receipt			1
in what @entity8 seems to have construed as a mortal insult , the employee offered @entity8 her entire order free the next time she entered the store to make up for the oversight			1
to the credit of @entity4 staff , they are unfailingly polite to @entity8 , despite the insults , swearing and racial slurs spat at them			1
in between orders of bacon and cheese croissants ( bacon extra crispy ) , iced coffee with extra cream and extra sugar and a @entity52 , which @entity8 mistakenly thinks the workers have forgotten			1
the eight minute and nine second ordeal begins with @entity8 warning the male employee who serves her , ' this is all being under video surveillance , ok ? ' she then tells him her complaint : that a female employee the night before forgot to print out her receipt and then ' turned into a complete rude b * tch '			1
she neglects to explain exactly how the employee did her wrong though			0
' she told me , ok , you can get your order free next time			2
so you know what i told her ? i want the whole f * * * * n ' menu , b * * * h. twice			0
' butter would n't melt : from the way @entity78 business owners on her @entity26 channel , you 'd never guess she 'd racially abuse fast food workers because of a forgotten receipt according to @entity8 , her lawyer is ' already on it ' and she says she 'd spoken to someone from the store earlier that day who told her she could have her order free			1
the employee explains that he does n't know what happened the night before but reassures @entity8 he 's happy to give her what she wants			2
she begins to order , asking for the @entity95 , which she admits was not one of the items she ordered the day before			0
@entity8 tells a fellow customer , ' i just want my bacon crispy and my people nice , you know ? ' ' cos i literally thought this was the best one in the city , and i gave you guys so many good , like , remarks online because i have a business degree and , like , i really did until that b * * * h just completely p * * * * d me off , ' she explains , reasonably			2
@entity8 attempts to engage her fellow customers in the video , but they are n't forthcoming			1
' that 's your issue , ' says one man			0
' i 've got my own issues			0
' a receipt ai n't one , though , as he tells @entity8 that he is always given his receipt at @entity4			1
first world problems : ' this is what you have to do in life , it f * * * * * g sucks			0
blow my brains out , ' says @entity8 to the camera as she receives free food and racially abuses the people serving her ' i 'm from @entity131 in @entity132 , ' @entity8 tells the man , ' and up there this s * * t does n't happen , ' she says , but goes on to mention that ' one time they p * ssed in my fries where i 'm from at home			1
literally i could smell the p * ss. ' ' so i know they 're probably sh * ttin ' and p * ssin in it , because they really do n't give a sh * t , ' she says loudly			0
' that 's why i 'm not eating this food , i 'm giving it to my boyfriend			2
' the worst is yet to come , though , when @entity8 spies the woman she believed was rude to her the night before			1
' well , guess what ? this s * * t ’s about to go live , b * * * h. right on @entity12 , ' she rants			0
' cause i already posted what your dumb ass did last night			0
so i hope you ’re happy with your little f * * * * g sand n * * * * r self			0
cause i ’m about to nuke your whole f * * * * g planet from @entity161			1
you think ya ’ll are tough big fat @entity163 bombin ’ the @entity164 ? i ’ll show you tough , ' she yells to the woman , who calmly goes about her business behind the counter			2
@entity8 's @entity171 profile says she 's currently the marketing manager for @entity172 , but according to @entity174 the company says she has n't worked there for more than a year			2
@entity8 , whose @entity171 profile says she went to @entity177 in @entity178 , also has a @entity26 channel on which she has posted numerous marketing videos of low production quality			2
expressing her excitement at posting the video , she says , ' @entity185 , this is what you have to do in life , it f * * * * * g sucks			2
blow my brains out , ' a sentiment shared by many who have seen the video			0
@entity193 commented , ' i think she is mentally ill. ' @entity194 describes her as ' a disgusting piece of gutter slime ' and writes : ' clearly you are not employed with that level of ignorance			0
the best part about this is once it 's on the internet , it 's there for @entity204			0
i hope any prospective employer / boyfriend / in - laws gets a good look at what a piece of trash you really are			0
' @entity211 wrote , ' and now everybody knows what ﻿ kind of a human being you are			0
' @entity8 has removed her @entity12 page , but the video of which she was so proud remains on @entity26 , where its comment section is growing ever longer .			1

@entity0 woman @entity8 made a ' surveillance video ' of herself berating employees of her local @entity4 store because she did not receive a receipt the last time she was there
despite polite *treatment* and free food , she becomes more and more agitated and racially abuses the staff
@entity8 appears to blame @entity4 for 9/11 and promises to ' nuke ' them ' from @entity161 '
