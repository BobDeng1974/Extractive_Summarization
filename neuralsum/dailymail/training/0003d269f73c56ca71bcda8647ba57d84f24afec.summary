in may 2009 euphoria swept through @entity1 as @entity2 won the @entity3			1
following this event , reports predicted the win would spark a baby boom in @entity1 and now scientists have confirmed that the number of births in february 2010 did indeed rise , by 16 per cent			2
there was also an 11 per cent increase seen in births in march 2010 , which the scientists claim may have still been a knock - on effect of the win			0
@entity1 researchers analysed birth data at maternity centres in @entity19 from before and after @entity2 won the title in may , 2009			1
it found a 16 % increase in february 2010 , nine months after the event , compared to births in february in previous and later years ( marked by grey squares ) initial reports in @entity1 claimed the birth rate following the @entity3 win had spiked by 45 per cent , which has now been disproved			1
following , the 1965 blackout in the northeast @entity32 , the @entity30 published four consecutive articles reporting a 30 per cent increase in the birth rates of five hospitals in @entity37			1
however , in 1970 , research found that there had actually been a 20 to 25 per cent decline in births rather than an increase			0
following @entity44 , reports claim that between 1946 and 1964 the number of annual births exceeded two per 100 women - which worked at approximately 2 per cent of the global population at that time			0
the children born during this time have been dubbed ' the @entity51 ' , named after @entity52 who scored the winning goal			1
the initial 45 per cent claims were considered to be so high , scientists at the @entity57 clinical center in the @entity19 region of @entity59 wanted to confirm this			0
the researchers began by analysing birth data between 2007 and 2012 at two maternity centres in @entity64 , capital of @entity59			0
as well as being home to the clinic , @entity59 was also the birthplace of @entity68 who was the @entity2 manager at the time of the @entity3 win			2
the researchers found that births in this @entity19 region rose by 16 per cent in february 2010 and 11 per cent in march , compared to previous and later years			0
however , other sporting wins did not generate such a boom			0
the researchers actually saw a drop in birth rate towards the end of 2010 , despite the fact @entity2 also won the @entity82 in august 2009 and @entity1 won the @entity83 in december 2009			2
the children born during this time have been dubbed the @entity51 , named after @entity2 player @entity52 , pictured , who scored the winning goal against @entity86			1
initial reports in @entity1 claimed the birth rate following this win had spiked by 45 per cent , which has now been disproved this may have been caused by the economic crisis in the country at the same time , claim the authors			1
‘ in summary , our results may have several different interpretations , ’ said the researchers in their paper ' @entity2 baby boom : does sporting success affect birth rate ? ' ‘ one is that human emotions on a large scale can profoundly affect demographic swings in populations , that national or regional events can reduce the weight of reason and increase the weight of passion			1
‘ validation of our results could contribute to a better understanding of human behaviour , improve healthcare planning , and even aid government policy makers in stimulating or reducing birth rates			2
‘ ideally , to bridge the gap between observational and trial data , it would help greatly if @entity52 were willing to replicate his intervention — although the cost of such a study could be prohibitive , not to mention harmful to the reference group ( @entity86 )			0
’ aside from the baby boom in february , comparative birth rates declined in the second half of 2012			1
this was despite the fact @entity1 also won the @entity83 in december 2009			0
the researchers claimed this may have been due to the economic crisis in the country			0

in may 2009 , @entity2 won the @entity3
initial reports claimed that birth rates following this event rose by 45 %
however , research from has now confirmed this increase was 16 %
they compared the *change* in birth rates from 2007 to 2012
these children have been dubbed ‘ the @entity51 ’ after winning goal scorer @entity52
