@entity7 ’s record of 13 points from their opening 10 league games is their worst since 1986			1

@entity18 warned that it might take until the end of his three - year deal to get it right , and admitted that the current situation is unsatisfactory for the owners and supporters after @entity7 spent more than £ 150million on players in the summer			1

‘ i feel myself very lousy for the fans in the first place , and also the board because they have a great belief in me , my staff and my players			2
‘ when you have 13 points from 10 matches you are n’t doing well but we are in a process			1
i said from the beginning when we won every game ( on tour ) in the @entity91 that the process shall take more than one year — it will take three years , i hope , because that is always dependent on a lot of things			2
‘ i can not say when the results will come			2
when i did it with @entity99 it was december 8 , but it could be february 1 here			1

i have signed for three years			2

it is based on that			2
you can think differently and believe differently			2
‘ i can not speak for him ( @entity2 )			1
i can only speak for myself			2
i have already given the answer			2

@entity132 scorers : @entity131 ( 2 ) , @entity125 @entity18 hands out instructions to @entity30 during their 1 - 0 defeat by @entity74 last sunday @entity73 celebrates scoring @entity74 's winning goal at the @entity137 last weekend ‘ i have experience that people have a great belief in what we are doing and in the way we are playing , ’ said @entity18			1
‘ when i am in the streets i have been surrounded by very positive sayings			2
‘ i am training in another way to what most of the other managers are doing			0
i train players in their brains			0
every player has to know why he is doing things on the pitch			0
‘ that will give results in time and not only one game			0
that is what i want to develop			0
not only for one match , but for a certain period and that takes time			0

with @entity188 and @entity189 still injured , @entity18 refused to confirm whether midfielder @entity45 would fill in as an emergency centre back alongside either @entity65 or @entity66			0
there was at least more positive news on @entity69 with @entity7 confirming that they have decided not to send the @entity194 defender for shoulder surgery that would have kept him out of action for up to three months			1
@entity69 could now be back within six weeks , although @entity18 is aware that there is an increased risk that the player could suffer a recurrence of the problem			0
‘ maybe with this injury it is very difficult that it wo n’t happen again , and that ’s the problem , ’ he said			0
‘ it ’s always the same with this injury , i can not change that			0
the human body has been made by @entity209 , not by me			0
