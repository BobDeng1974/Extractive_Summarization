the @entity0 in @entity1 has come under extreme criticism after it posted a video of an @entity5 toddler uttering profanities to use as an example of ‘ the thug cycle ’			1
the diapered child is seen in a phone camera video taken by two purported relatives who are swearing at each other and the child and teaching him to swear back			1
' ... despite the fact that it is sickening , heartbreaking footage , we have an obligation to share it to continue to educate the law abiding public about the terrible cycle of violence and thuggery that some young innocent children find themselves helplessly trapped in , ’ said the post on their website			2
’ the post tells the public that they are ‘ literally watching “ the cycle ” of violence continue right in front of your eyes			2
a powerful cycle that must be broken if we ever hope to get a handle on violence in @entity33			0
a powerful cycle that the police alone can not stop			0
’ the so - called ‘ thug ’ who posted the video of the toddler has lashed back in a comment on the police association ’s @entity39 page , which has not done him any favours as it 's laced with f - word bombs			1
@entity44 president @entity43 , who is a sergeant in the @entity78 , told @entity79 that they use the term ‘ thug ’ as a ‘ general term on our @entity39 page ’ , but that it could be substituted by a variety of other terms including ‘ abnormal , antisocial , criminal ’			2
however , many people have taken to social media to criticize the move			0
one user , @entity91 , said on the union 's @entity39 page : ' as a union employee and member , i 'm ashamed that this post exists			0
not because of the video , but because of the racism			0
but hey , at least he 'll learn early that he 's nothing but an n - word to society			0
' defending their action of posting the video of the toddler and likening it to violence , @entity43 said that ' a lot of these children end up dealing with law enforcement '			1
warning : video contains graphic content taught bad things : the child is seen sticking up his middle finger , right , and in the left photo is covering his face as his relatives call him various profanities ‘ [ but ] i 'm not saying that this kid wo n't grow up to be a productive member of society			1
’ the post called the video 's creator , who is reportedly the toddler 's uncle , a ‘ local thug ’ , but @entity43 said : ‘ i do n't know that he 's a gangbanger ... he mentions 29th street , which is a local @entity130 gang here ’			1
he told @entity79 that his association is different to the police department , which is why they have ‘ a lot more latitude to be a little more edgy ’ and that edginess is necessary to force a deeper conversation on the city 's crime problems			2
@entity33 is largely ethnically segregated , he says , and many residents dismiss crime by saying ‘ it did n't happen in my part of town , that 's not a problem ’ , he said .			0
