millions of book lovers have made a pilgrimage to the @entity2 in @entity3 , known around the world as the home of the @entity7 sisters			1
now , the owner of a modest three - bedroom cottage six miles away aims to rival it as the ‘ true birthplace ’ of the famous literary family			0
the @entity14 listed cottage in the @entity16 village of @entity17 was built in 1802			1
literary heritage : the three - bedroom cottage in the @entity16 village of @entity17 was once home to the @entity7 family @entity22 , his wife @entity23 and their first two children , @entity26 and @entity27 , moved there in 1815 and it is where @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 and @entity7 were all delivered in front of the fireplace in 1816 , 1818 , 1820 and 1817 respectively			1
but five years after making it their home , the family moved to the @entity39 at nearby @entity3 – which has claimed the spotlight in the @entity7 story ever since			1
the cottage was shut up for years following the failure of a birthplace museum on the tourist @entity46 was let as private rented accommodation until it came back on the market last year			0
the historical home had been rented as bedsits to tenants in search of cheap accommodation but the plaques commemorating the births of the four gifted children outside the faded front door were barely noticed			1
new owner @entity60 converted the run - down property into a popular tourist attraction complete with cafe history : @entity22 , his wife @entity23 and their first two children , @entity26 and @entity27 , moved there in 1815			1
@entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 and @entity7 were all delivered in front of the fireplace famous residents : @entity7 with sisters @entity30 , @entity31 and @entity32 in a painting from 1848 after the last tenants packed their bags the absentee landlord put the property on the market last year			1
the @entity7 birthplace trust was formed by local villagers to save the property and turn it back into a museum again			1
but this scheme failed after @entity82 decided it could not afford to buy the property			2
amid fears it would be turned back into flats , businessman @entity60 and his wife @entity84 spotted the near - derelict property believing it to be an unpolished tourism gem			2
he renovated the home which was suffering from damp and flooding and has turned it into a deli where visitors can look round the @entity7 ’s private quarters			1
the cafe is due to open up in may following an extensive renovation			2
among other features , visitors will be able to inspect the very hearth where all three sisters were born			2
it also boasts the writing desk built into the structure where @entity104 wrote his first sermon - about the @entity106			0
birthplace : the drawing room still boasts the fireplace , in front of which @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 and @entity7 were all born cosy : the owners ' private living room complete with a wardrobe used by the @entity7 family the original desk where @entity104 wrote his first sermon - about the @entity106 the new owners , both 29 , sold their cottage in the village to buy the @entity7 home			1
they snapped it up as a repossession for £ 120,000 and then spent another £ 30,000 doing it up			1
the couple already had a track record , having converted a @entity14 listed building around the corner into a hair salon			0
but it was cheap because the 100 year old timber windows were rotten , the roof was leaking , and the wallpaper was falling off the walls - which were riddled with rising damp			0
the old scullery at the rear of the property had flooded through the back door with waste from the overflowing drains			2
mr @entity60 , a former quantity surveyor , said : ‘ it was so damp and humid			0
the drains were overflowing with years of dirt and debris			0
’ ‘ the property has been mistreated over the years and i wanted to bring tourists back to the village , ’ he said			2
‘ it is a very important property for @entity148 and we wanted to reclaim the history and restore the place to its former glory			2
’ the couple are sleeping in @entity22 and @entity23 ’s room complete with the writing desk where he wrote his first sermon – on @entity158 ’s victory at @entity159			1
businessman @entity160 and his wife @entity84 bought the house as a repossession for £ 120,000 and then spent further £ 30,000 doing it up delighted : new owner @entity160 said he wanted to reclaim the history of the property and restore it to its former glory the second bedroom where the younger @entity169 slept has become the drawing room , though it still has the built - in wardrobe used by the children			1
the third bedroom used by the @entity7 children ’s nurse serves as a study while the downstairs scullery has become their private kitchen			1
the rest of the downstairs rooms , including the drawing room with the famous fireplace , have been laid out as a delicatessen and coffee shop with room for 35 people due to open next month			0
a counter and open kitchen serving cakes , sandwiches , and pastries has been created in one of the front extensions built in the 1900s as a butcher ’s shop			0
the couple hope the trendy décor will attract of a new generation of @entity7 fans who previously may have regarded the sisters ’ writings as a touch highbrow			2
mr @entity60 added : ‘ we want to make the @entity169 cool and trendy			0
the @entity207 meetings and events at @entity3 seem to attract mainly older people			0
‘ the original idea of a museum is great - but you do not really get to sit there and enjoy reading a @entity7 book or a newspaper			2
’ @entity217 chairman @entity216 said : ‘ i am delighted			0
it will once again be somewhere that @entity7 fans can see the actual place the literary giants were brought into the world			2
‘ it could have been turned into flats - and that would have been a real shame			0
but @entity60 spotted a unique selling point for a coffee house			0
a portrait of @entity32 , @entity31 and @entity229 from 1834			1
it was painted by their brother @entity7 who had originally placed himself among his sisters , but removed his image so as not to clutter the picture ‘ @entity17 village needs the recognition as the first stop on any pilgrimage and we hope this helps the regeneration of the village			1
’ @entity207 chairman @entity243 said : ‘ the birthplace in @entity17 is hugely important in the @entity7 story			1
‘ in the bicentenary year of 2016 the world ’s attention will turn to all places linked with @entity229			0
‘ some years ago former @entity207 member , @entity249 , bought and tried to restore the house but sadly it proved just too big a project			0
‘ it is a pity the @entity217 ’s hopes of turning the house into a museum were pipped at the post but it was n’t to be and it is heartening to hear the new owners are keen to sympathetically retain the history			0
’ @entity22 wrote of his time in @entity17 : ‘ my happiest days were spent there			1
‘ this is where the family was complete : father , mother and children , and where they had kind friends			0
’ in @entity3 , he said , he felt like ‘ a stranger in a strange land ’ .			0
