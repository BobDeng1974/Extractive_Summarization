the players have been told that and we have made changes to create that , ' @entity0 said			2
' you get to a point around this time of the week when your work is done and the players have to take the responsibility for delivering			0

' @entity78 will offer another carrying option , giving us more ball carriers than we 've had , ' @entity0 said			2
