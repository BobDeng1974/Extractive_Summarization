some residents of one of @entity3 's wealthiest neighborhoods have voted to nix current plans for a handicap access path in order to preserve their views of the @entity8			1
what 's more , the new plan that @entity10 have approved will force some wheelchair - bound to traverse an additional block for access to the @entity8 esplanade walkway , one that includes a dangerously busy parking garage			1
the move preserves the panoramic river view for residents of the apartment tower at 45 @entity21 , where apartments can fetch up to $ 3 million , the @entity16 reports			2
vetoed : a proposed wheelchair ramp ( rendering pictured ) would block panoramic @entity8 views for some @entity27 residents in @entity28 , so they voted to move it danger : the new proposal will force the wheelchair - bound to traverse an extra block that includes this dangerously busy parking garage there currently exists just a crumbling set of stairs connecting a raised walkway and public park with the @entity8 walkway down below			1
in order to update those stairs and make them accessible for the handicapped , the city has proposed a new , fenced walkway that would stretch some 450 feet			0
that most notably puts it directly in front of the posh 45 @entity47 , where one 30 - year - old resident told the @entity16 : ' i would look outside of my window and feel like a mouse in a laboratory ... the view of the water would be ruined for a lot of people			0
' improvements : currently there is only this non-accessible bridge and set of decaying stairs regulations require that the walkway , which will extend above busy @entity64 -- a highway extending up the length of @entity3 's @entity27 -- be lined by a fence to ensure nothing is thrown onto the roadway			1
resident of the local community board have suggested the chain - link be replaced with plexiglass			0
however , city planners fear that , while preserving the view , a plastic barrier would be susceptible to vandalism and decay			0
groundbreaking is scheduled to take place on the ramp this spring , with a completion date projected for june 2016 , according to @entity83			0
pricey : most affected by the view - obstructing bridge would have been residents of this building , where an apartment currently for sale has an asking price of $ 2.8 million			2

along the @entity8 in one of @entity3 's wealthiest neighborhoods , residents have voted to move the bridge a block north to 82nd street
between 81st and 82nd lies a dangerously busy parking garage that many wheelchair bound would have to brave to get the bridge access
the previous bridge would have placed a caged walkway between a building where apartments cost nearly $ @entity106 and the @entity8
