it ’s a decision that every seasoned traveller has wrestled with when a hotel doorman calls a taxi or a guide wraps up a tour – who should you tip during your travels and how generous should you be ? while tipping is customary in most @entity12 nations , many tourists are making big mistakes when it ’s time to show their appreciation for good or exceptional service , largely because they do n’t know how much to give and they are unaware of local customs			1
it can lead to awkward or uncomfortable situations , especially when the amount does n’t reflect the quality of the service provided or no tip is given at all to someone who is expecting one or may be relying on gratuity to pay their bills			1

‘ if in doubt , a small gratuity is taken a sign of appreciation			0
’ @entity92 , travel expert at @entity94 , added : ‘ for those who are prepared to put a dent in their travel spend to cough up the cash needed for service charges , the rules surrounding tipping around the world are far from finite			0
