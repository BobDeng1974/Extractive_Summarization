featured guests included @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity9 , @entity12 , @entity13 and @entity31 anger : comedian @entity12 and actor @entity13 were behind many of the offensive remarks on @entity2 's @entity4 of the year 2012 television watchdog @entity34 has received at least 160 complaints about the content of the prerecorded show and @entity2 has received another 130			1
it means @entity34 is coming under increased pressure to launch an investigation into why @entity41 bosses allowed the pre-recorded show to be broadcast at primetime during the @entity45 holidays			1
however that did not stop @entity2 from broadcasting the quiz again at 11.35pm last night or editing its content			1
@entity49 of @entity50 said : ' this show should have always been consigned to the latenight slot and should never have been on at primetime			0
' it is postpub television but it was put out at a time when people are usually expecting shows such as @entity59 or @entity60			0
' @entity2 chief executive @entity61 will return to his desk on monday to find out whether @entity34 is to launch an inquiry			2
targets : the comics made crude jokes about gold medal sprinter @entity18 , left , and singer @entity19 , right bad taste : obscene jokes were also made about the @entity16 ( pictured left ) and president @entity17 ( right ) only one board member , @entity70 , responded to @entity72 's requests for a comment , saying only that it was not up to the board to make ' creative ' decisions			2
the @entity41 press office said its board members would not be making any comment			0
it repeated a request for us not to contact its chairman @entity83 and said its chief executive @entity61 was still on holiday in @entity86			0
the only comment @entity41 would make was one issued on @entity88 which said : ' @entity4 is a well - established comedic and satirical review of the year 's events with well - known guests and was broadcast after the watershed with appropriate warnings			0
' silence : despite at least 240 complaints from viewers , @entity41 has refused to comment on the furore conservative mp @entity98 , a member of the @entity100 culture select committee , said : ' the number of complaints speaks to the fact that the @entity105 public think that obscene jokes , not least about members of the @entity108 , are unacceptable			2
the management at @entity2 ... need to be reminded that there are standards of behaviour that are required from public broadcasters			0
@entity2 is in receipt of public money so it needs to be accountable to public opinion			0
' @entity34 is likely to consider an investigation into the broadcast because much of the crude content came so soon after the 9pm watershed			1
