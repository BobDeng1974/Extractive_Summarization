two brothers have been kicked out of classes at school and made to study in isolation because they have spiky haircuts			1
@entity5 , 16 , and his 13 - year - old brother @entity6 , returned for lessons at @entity8 in @entity9 , @entity10 , last week proudly sporting their new styles			1
but teachers branded their haircuts ' extreme ' and took them out of their classes and placed them in isolation instead			2
@entity5 and his brother @entity6 , who were both taken out of classes at school because they have spiky hair they said that the style , which is closely shaved on the sides but spiky on top , broke school rules and their policy on uniform			1
today , the teens ' father @entity29 , 44 , told of his anger at the ban on the style , which is called the skinfade , as he says most children are sporting it these days			1
he explained : ' i understood the school has its policies that include hairstyles			0
' but i ’m just angry they seem to have been singled out			0
' there are so many boys at the @entity8 that have the same haircut and they do not seem to have been sent to the pastoral room			2
the brothers were being made to study by themselves in isolation after teachers branded their hairstyles ' extreme ' ' it ’s an area where children are segregated from the rest of the school			1
' they are not allowed to go outside for break and @entity6 had his lunch brought to him - a pizza that he said was cold and he could n’t eat			0
' mr @entity5 said it was only when he mentioned that other boys , including his older son , had similar haircuts , that @entity5 was also told to work in pastoral			2
he added : ' when they contacted me last week and said that yet again they were going into pastoral , then i went and picked them up from school			0
' @entity5 is in his last year at school and , with exams coming up , it is vital that he goes into lessons			2
the boys attend the @entity8 in @entity9 , @entity10 , pictured , who say they have a clear uniform policy ' the boys and i have talked about hairstyles and we have agreed that in the future they will not have hairstyles such as this			1
' @entity81 , headteacher at the school , which caters for 1,200 pupils aged 11 to 18 , said : ' we are unable to discuss individual cases involving students due to their age and vulnerability			0
' we have clear policies at the school , that have been in place for many years , and parents / carers and students are made fully aware of these			0
' we set high standards for all students and when our policies are not adhered to , we work supportively with parents and the appropriate action is taken			0
