@entity2 bt @entity0 @entity2 delivered on his promise to exact revenge on @entity0 but did so with brains not brawn in @entity29 on saturday night			1
in front of a raucous home crowd , @entity2 boxed his way to victory over the @entity34 who faded in the second half of a fight that did n't quite live up to the hype			1
there was surprise at the announcement of a split decision but despite one judge giving @entity0 the nod , @entity2 deservedly took the spoils in the rematch			1
the victor said : ' it 's over			0
i 'll fight anywhere , he 's not a cruiserweight			0
it 's been a long camp , 12 weeks , he was pacing himself and he looked at the belly and thought i would tire – i do n’t tire at cruiserweight			0
' after beating @entity2 in 2011 , @entity0 made three routine defences of his light - heavyweight world title , barely losing a round against uninspiring opponents			1
with a fight against @entity60 seemingly further away than ever , @entity0 took an unnecessary risk by facing hard - hitting @entity62 last summer			1
but the gamble backfired spectacularly as the @entity34 was dismantled over four brutal rounds in front of his home crowd in @entity67			0
he was untroubled until struggling to a draw with the tricky @entity85 but won a unanimous decision in the rematch two months later			0
then , 12 months ago , on his birthday on the last day of november , he fought world champion @entity89 in @entity90 but was stopped in the sixth round , prompting a move to cruiserweight where he would soon be joined by @entity0			2
by now , both were promoted by @entity95 and a rematch was inevitable			0
a three - fight plan was set and after each enjoyed two routine stoppage victories , the waiting was over			2
much has been made of @entity2 's apparently superior power at cruiserweight but @entity0 was confident he had grown into the weight after adding almost two stone of muscle			1
the 27 - year - old is now under the tutelage of former strength and conditioning coach @entity108 having split from father @entity109 who had guided him to his world title			2
and it was he made the better start , winning the jab exchanges in the opening round as @entity2 looked to land his dynamite left hook			2
but the home favourite settled in the second session , forcing @entity0 back , preventing him from measuring the distance and finding his range			2
and the former world champion looked uncomfortable under pressure while his own attack amounted to little more than a pawing jab			0
in the fourth round , however , he slung his hands low in defiance , as if to show @entity2 his power was having little effect			2
in the next , @entity0 appeared to settle on the back foot , outboxing and outfoxing @entity2 to enjoy his best spell since the opening session			1
by the halfway stage , @entity0 appeared to be coping well with his bigger opponent as he levelled the score on my card			2
@entity2 seemed to get the better of @entity0 throughout the later rounds of the cruiserweight clash @entity2 dodges a punch from @entity141 in the early rounds of the fight at the @entity144 and he continued to frustrate the home favourite who , despite throwing more punches , was struggling to make them count			1
but his persistence paid off in round eight as he forced @entity0 to cling on in the centre of the ring			0
it would prove to be a turning point			0
tiredness set in and @entity0 struggled to hold off the bigger man 's advances			0
at first he traded on the ropes , toe - to - toe , punch - for - punch			0
it was @entity2 who edged these exchanges which grew more one - sided as the fight entered the home straight			1
@entity0 tries to protect his face after @entity2 throws a punch in the direction of the @entity34 @entity2 aims a punch at his @entity71 rival while @entity0 puts his hand up to block @entity2 salutes his fans after exacting revenge on @entity141 in the @entity71 showdown @entity0 hangs his head in shame after losing the bout to @entity2 1,134 days after his win against his rival @entity0 ( right ) looks dejected while @entity2 ( left ) celebrates his win over the @entity34 three years ago , @entity2 tired down the stretch but the roles were reversed as @entity0 opted to play rope - a - dope			1
he needed a big response going into the last two stanzas but opted to stand in the same spot against the ropes for the next two rounds			0
@entity0 later revealed he hurt his right hand in the second round			0
at the bell it was @entity2 who celebrated ; @entity0 simply looked beaten			1
he said : ' i said it would be a replica of the first			0
a split decision shows my character , he was using his natural strength - maybe we 'll have a third fight one day , this is the second time i 've come to @entity29 , maybe we have a third fight in @entity67			1
' @entity2 entered the @entity144 ring wearing an @entity205 robe ahead of his showdown with @entity0 @entity29 striker @entity207 was at the fight to watch @entity2 take on @entity0 @entity210 striker @entity209 was also at the @entity144 to watch @entity2 's rematch with @entity0			1

@entity2 edged out @entity0 via split decision by the judges despite looking strong in later rounds
the three judges scored fight *114* - **115** *116* - *112* **115** - *113* to @entity218
the fight came 1,134 days after the first fight between the @entity71 rivals at the same venue
@entity0 is keen on a third and final fight at the @entity226 in @entity227
