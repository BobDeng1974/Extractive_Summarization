twice as many teenagers are using e-cigarettes than conventional smoking with fears this could potentially lead to an addiction to nicotine			1
the findings have raised concerns that e-cigarettes - widely viewed as harmless to health - might act as a ' gateway ' to tobacco			1
the study , based on surveys of 50,000 students in 400 secondary schools in the @entity18 , is the first sign among this age group the use of e-cigarettes has surpassed the use of traditional tobacco products , researchers claim			1
the new findings have raised concerns that e-cigarettes - widely viewed as harmless to health - might act as a ' gateway ' to tobacco dr @entity29 , deputy director of the @entity30 , said : ' i was really surprised that among the eighth graders over a third of users of e-cigarettes had n't previously tried tobacco cigarettes ' in a lot of kids , their first exposure to nicotine is now with these e-products			1
' speaking at the @entity44 ( @entity44 ) annual meeting in @entity46 , @entity47 , dr @entity29 warned about the potential dangers of e-cigarettes			2
he said : ' there is potential that if you start with e-cigarettes , that gets you into a nicotine habit , and then you switch over to the real thing			2
that 's speculation but what we do n't want to do is look back and say i wish we 'd done something			0
' just like tobacco becomes a habit that 's life long and hard to break , e-cigarettes might start you on the same pathway			1
the model @entity69 with an e-cigarette - they are widely used as an aid to quitting smoking ' they could not be described as harmless			2
nicotine itself is not a harmless substance			0
it produces changes in heart rate and blood pressure , can be dangerous in high doses , and certainly would n't be recommended for the adolescent brain			0
' he said it was important parents did not fall into the trap of thinking that ' vaping ' e-cigarettes were harmless			0
' parents are our most important tool for shaping teenager behaviour and they may not see this as risky , ' he added			0
the study found that among 14 to 16 - year - olds , nine per cent reported using an e-cigarette in the past 30 days , while only four per cent had smoked a tobacco cigarette			1
among 17 and 18 - year - olds , 16 per cent reported using an e-cigarette compared to 14 per cent smoking a cigarette			0
scientists also found that 36 per cent of 13 and 14 - year - olds who had used e-cigarettes had never smoked a real cigarette			0
@entity103 smokes an e-cigarette - a study has found far more teenagers are now turning to e-cigarettes e-cigarettes , widely used as an aid to quitting smoking , contain a heating element that produces a vapour containing nicotine but are free of many of the harmful substances associated with tobacco			1
the vapour is often given sweet flavours - examples include bubble gum and milk chocolate cream - that might be attractive to younger teens , the researchers said			0
' e-cigarettes have made rapid inroads into the lives of @entity18 adolescents , ' said senior study investigator dr @entity127 from the @entity128			1
he added : ' part of the reason for the popularity of e-cigarettes is the perception among teens that they do not harm health			0
' the same investigation , now in its 40th year , revealed a long - term decline in the use of tobacco cigarettes by @entity18 teenagers			1
@entity140 , chief executive of @entity141 , said , ' nicotine can be harmful to the growing brain so it 's best if young people avoid it			0
but if they 're going to experiment it 's better to use e-cigarettes as vaping is far less dangerous than smoking and much less addictive			2
' so far in the @entity151 and the @entity18 , smoking rates are going down more than e-cigarette use is growing			1
this would not be the case if vaping really were a gateway into smoking			2
