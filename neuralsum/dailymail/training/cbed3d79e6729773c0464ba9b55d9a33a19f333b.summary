@entity0 has spoken of his frustration at not playing regularly for @entity2 with @entity3 reluctant to use the winger in the @entity5			1
@entity0 was selected in @entity9 ’s 26 - man @entity7 squad for games against @entity11 and @entity12 next week , but has fallen out of favour at @entity14			1
the winger has played just 109 minutes in four substitute @entity5 appearances this season , and has mainly been used in the @entity18 and @entity19			1
@entity0 ( left ) is keen on getting some more @entity5 minutes under his belt @entity0 was in impressive form during his side 's 2 - 1 win against @entity24 in the @entity18 @entity0 has revealed he wants to make himself ' hard to drop ' like club team - mate @entity25 the 23 - year - old opened the scoring against @entity24 on thursday in the @entity18 with a penalty , before going on to set @entity25 up to double @entity2 ’s lead in @entity31			1
it was @entity0 ’s first goal and assist in the competition as the north @entity36 club won 2 - 1			2
and the attacker has been looking to @entity25 for inspiration who , while awaiting a senior @entity7 call up , is being handed more @entity5 opportunities by @entity3			1
you are a footballer and you want to play every week and every single game but you have got to be patient , ’ @entity0 said			2
‘ when you get your @entity18 or @entity19 games you have got to make an impression like @entity25 has done			0
‘ you have got to score goals and make yourself hard to drop and i think @entity25 has done that			1
‘ he has got 10 goals in cup games , he has made himself hard to drop and i am looking to do the same for now			0
’ @entity0 showed composure from the penalty spot to score past goalkeeper @entity53 @entity3 has favoured the likes of @entity55 and @entity56 in the @entity5 @entity0 ’s selection comes a year after he scored against @entity58 at @entity59 as @entity7 all but guaranteed their place at the @entity62 in @entity63			1
the goal was later voted the fans ’ favourite of qualifying , although the winger missed the tournament in @entity63 due to ankle ligament damage			0
but the man who has been on loan to nine different clubs since 2009 believes his most recent call up can help his @entity5 ambitions			0
‘ the last time i got called up i trained really well , ’ he added			0
‘ i was rewarded with 25 minutes against @entity76 and scored another goal so it was good the manager ( @entity9 ) showed faith in me			0
‘ i 'm going to go away , work my socks off for a week , 10 days , and hopefully i can get some more game time			0
‘ i think the manager ( @entity3 ) realises every time i have been called upon for my country i have done myself justice			0
‘ so hopefully i can keep playing well when called upon for my national team and come back to my club after that and hopefully establish myself in the @entity5			2

@entity2 winger @entity0 is frustrated at his lack of minutes in the @entity5
