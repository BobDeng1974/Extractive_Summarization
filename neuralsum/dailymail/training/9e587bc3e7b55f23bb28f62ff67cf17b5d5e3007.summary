two brave police officers doubled snake catchers when they were called to a four - storey unit block in @entity4 's south			1
a terrified resident raised the alarm when they spotted a large @entity8 carpet python slithering along their window on @entity11 at @entity12			1
one of the officers was trained by @entity15 wildlife rescue organisation wires and luckily had his snake catching equipment with him			1
but the policeman did not walk away unscathed after the snake bit him while he was trying to wrangle it			0
as the @entity14 - trained officer got his tools and started working on capturing the snake , his colleague held onto a net , ready to trap it			2
at one point , the net - wielding policeman asked his partner - who was trying to pry the snake away from the window with a hook - what the snake felt like			2
the snake - catching officer asked his colleague if he wanted to touch it			2
this was met with an emphatic ' no '			0
one of the officers , from @entity50 's @entity49 , was a snake catcher who was trained by wires the officers were identified on the @entity53 's @entity52 as @entity54 and @entity55 the officers were identified on the @entity53 's @entity52 as @entity54 and @entity55			1
but it proved to be a trickier task than initially thought as the creature was ' very strong ' and refused to let go of the window 's edge			0
eventually , the snake lets go but not before it was able to sink its teeth into the constable			0
but a @entity53 spokesman told @entity65 no one was seriously injured during the process .			0
