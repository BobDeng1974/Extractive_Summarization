his intricate knowledge of the human body , which was years ahead of his time , is demonstrated in a collection of notebooks which he filled with detailed studies of organs , bones , vessels and muscles using new illustrative techniques			2
the collection of notebooks , which date between 1452 and 1519 , and chart much of the @entity24 renaissance artist 's groundbreaking studies of the human body			2
detailed : @entity5 's sketches of muscles and skeletons foreshadow modern techniques , such as mri scans and @entity32 computer modelling , to ' an astonishing degree ' a still from the 3d animation of the chest , shoulder and arm , left , that will be shown alongside the sketches talented : @entity5 is still considered to be one of the greatest anatomists the world has ever seen comparison : @entity5 's anatomical drawing of a hand is remarkably similar to modern medical scans and models which show just how true to life the artist 's work was almost 500 years after his death , the drawings in his anatomical notebooks are being displayed at an exhibition in @entity55 alongside 21st - century pictures of the same body parts - with @entity5 's sketches proving startlingly accurate			1
the exhibition entitled @entity5 : @entity60 is being held at @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 , and runs from august 2 to november 10			0
curators say his work foreshadows modern techniques like mri scans and @entity32 computer modelling ' to an astonishing degree '			0

exhibition curator @entity110 , of @entity111 , said : ' this is the first time that @entity5 's anatomical drawings have been displayed alongside their modern - day counterparts			1
' it 's incredibly exciting to discover how @entity5 's investigations 500 years ago foreshadowed the work of today 's leading anatomists to an astonishing degree			1
' eerie : the notebooks , which date between 1452 and 1519 , contain incredibly detailed images of the human body a screen garb from a 3d film of a dissected and plastinated shoulder , pictured left , and @entity5 's drawing , pictured right dedicated : @entity5 dissected more than 30 human corpses to learn about the human anatomy so his paintings and sculptures would be as realistic and accurate as possible ahead of his time : thirty sheets of the artist 's work kept by the @entity111 show just how far - sighted @entity5 â€™s work was @entity138 , professor of clinical anatomy at @entity139 , who helped the show 's curators , said : ' in many ways @entity5 predicted the 20th - century revolution in various medical imaging techniques			1
' his use of cross sections and slices to show deep internal structures within the body foreshadowed the modern techniques of @entity152 and @entity154 scanning			0
' the anatomical accuracy of @entity5 's drawings has rarely ever been surpassed , and i still use them to teach surgeons and medical students today			2
' the muscles of the shoulder , arm and the bones of the foot , c.1510 - 11 : a 3d film of a dissected shoulder will show the incredible accuracy of the many drawings of the bones , muscles , nerves and tendons of the joint perfect model : @entity5 's perfectly proportioned drawing of a human skeleton a ct model of a skeleton , pictured right , which will be placed at the exhibition next to @entity5 's skeleton sketches master of the arts : many professors of anatomy say they still use @entity5 's drawings to teach medical students as the accuracy of his work has rarely been surpassed breaking down the body : animation of the vertebral column , pictured left , and @entity5 's drawing of one , right @entity5 is best known for his stunning artwork but the @entity196 had many talents			1
he was also a sculptor , architect , musician , mathematician , engineer , inventor , anatomist , geologist , cartographer , botanist , and writer			0
the @entity3 is his most famous and most parodied portrait while his painting of @entity210 is the most reproduced religious painting of all time			0
@entity5 's drawing of the @entity214 is also regarded as a cultural icon - being reproduced on items as varied as the euro coin , textbooks , and t - shirts			1
only around fifteen of his paintings survive because of his constant , and frequently disastrous , experimentation with new techniques , and his chronic procrastination			0
@entity5 is also revered for his technological ingenuity			0
he conceptualised a helicopter , a tank , concentrated solar power , a calculator , and the double hull , also outlining a rudimentary theory of plate tectonics			0
relatively few of his designs were constructed or were even feasible during his lifetime , but some of his smaller inventions , such as an automated bobbin winder and a machine for testing the tensile strength of wire , entered the world of manufacturing unheralded			0
he made important discoveries in anatomy , civil engineering , optics , and hydrodynamics , but he did not publish his findings and they had no direct influence on later science .			0
