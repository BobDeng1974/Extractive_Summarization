by @entity0 @entity1 has had his wife to thank for fuelling @entity3 all season but the evergreen striker has decided to ban her cooking with @entity7 in sight			1
the east @entity10 club compete for a place in the championship when they take on @entity13 at @entity7 in the @entity14 play - off final			1
and a large portion of their success this term can be traced back to the @entity1 family , and that is not just @entity1 ’s 18 goals			1
chef : @entity1 's wife @entity24 has been cooking for the @entity3 squad on away trips in form : the evergreen striker has scored 18 goals for the @entity29 's this season the @entity32 striker ’s wife , @entity24 , has been providing the food for @entity3 ’s away trips all season — and they finished with the third best record on their travels , losing only three			1
but @entity1 revealed that his wife ’s cooking has been put on hold for the final trip of the season , the 23 miles from @entity40 to @entity7 , to ensure no one picks up any last - minute stomach bugs			1
he said : ‘ she has done it all through the season			2
it helps after training on the way to an away game			0
we have only lost three away games			0
i am going to put that down to my missus ’s cooking			2
record : @entity3 lost just three away games all season and are now facing @entity13 at @entity7 top job : @entity66 has done an excellent job at @entity40 on a tiny budget ‘ she cooks macaroni and cheese , rice , chicken — nothing too spicy			1
we travel halfway , then we train			0
then we will jump back on the coach and eat it			0
it is @entity80 food and the lads love it			0
‘ but she wo n’t be cooking for the final — i do n’t want her anywhere near it just in case anything happens and someone gets ill. we will eat at the hotel and we will do things properly			2
’ @entity1 describes this as the biggest game of a career which began nearly two decades ago			1
it was this weekend 16 years ago that he was an unused substitute for @entity95 in arguably the most memorable play - off match in history — when his south @entity10 club beat @entity99 on penalties to reach the @entity101 after a 4 - 4 draw at the old @entity7			1
youngster : @entity1 was an unused substitute when @entity95 were promoted to the @entity101 in ' 99 and now he is determined to finally take his chance on the pitch			1
he added : ‘ i was 19 at the time and to be part of that squad was a massive accomplishment for me			0
from the beginning to the end and from the night until the morning			0

‘ you sit down and you dream it will be you one day			0
