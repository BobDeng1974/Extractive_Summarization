@entity0 , pictured leaving court yesterday , is currently claiming benefits but has looked for work as a lorry driver , according to his mother his privileged background provides him with a title , a stately home and a 4,000 - acre country estate			1
yet it appears the @entity0 is also entitled – courtesy of the taxpayer – to around £ 71 per week in @entity15			0
the aristocrat was revealed to be receiving the state benefit at his latest court appearance over a long - running feud with estate trustees			1
the 60 - year - old earl , full name @entity25 @entity24 , had been due to stand trial after denying damaging six pheasant feeders worth £ 66 and the theft of a battery and electrical power unit worth £ 80			1
the offences were said to have happened at his @entity32 , near @entity34 , @entity35 , which has been in his family for almost 1,000 years			1
the troubled aristocrat claims to live there with rain coming in through the roof , no hot water , unsafe electrics and with heating confined to a single room after falling out with trustees in 2007 resulting in a reduced income			1
the @entity47 claims he must visit the public baths in @entity34 to take a hot shower and goes to bed fully clothed wearing a hat to keep warm			0
the descendant of the man who led the @entity55 , the earl is at loggerheads with the trustees of his country pile			1
he took one of them , his former friend @entity61 , to the @entity62 accusing him of selling family portraits without his permission , but lost the case			0
their continued dispute , said to date back to 2007 , has left him broke , he says			2
yesterday at @entity68 he was bound over in the sum of £ 200 to keep the peace – meaning the prosecution will probably drop all charges if he causes no trouble for a year			2
@entity0 , pictured with wife @entity74 outside @entity75 , part of his huge @entity32 , near @entity34 , receives about £ 71 a week in @entity77 the @entity0 lost a legal battle this month with his trustees over the sale of ancestral portraits @entity82 is descendant of the 7th @entity83 who famously led the disastrous @entity85 cavalry charge of the 600 in 1854 against the @entity86 in the @entity87			1
their title goes back to 1611 when @entity90 created the @entity91 of @entity92 and offered titles to 200 men to help with the settlement of @entity96			0
they have lived on the same estate in @entity35 for 1,000 years			1
they rode ' into the jaws of @entity101 , into the mouth of @entity103 ' , wrote @entity104 in his poem commemorating the suicidal attack			0
an appalling series of misunderstandings led to the @entity55 advancing down a different valley from the one commander - in - chief , @entity110 , had intended when he dictated ambiguous orders for @entity112 , the cavalry commander			2
despite the fact that the order seemed to demand the cavalry to attack the @entity86 artillery without infantry support - in contravention of all accepted laws of military practice - an incredulous @entity112 passed the instructions on to the @entity0 , who commanded the @entity55 , and the troops advanced			2
664 men took part and 110 were left dead			0
@entity126 , prosecuting , said : ‘ these offences are generally of a nuisance and aimed at disrupting the workings of the trustees and the estate			1
’ @entity132 , defending , said the earl was maintaining his innocence but agreed to be bound over , adding : ‘ there is a @entity137 application by my client to remove the two trustees from the @entity32			1
’ mr @entity132 told the court that the earl is unemployed and has been receiving @entity15			2
‘ he is not working			0
one of his claims against the trustees is that they have withheld certain monies from him , ’ he said			2
last week , the earl , whose daughter @entity146 is pop singer @entity148 , was acquitted by magistrates of assaulting mr @entity61 and criminal damage			1
outside court yesterday , the earl , who was accompanied by his second wife , @entity74 , and her mother , said this case was the 14th set of allegations made against him during his long - running dispute			1
‘ most of them have been dismissed by the police as being too absurd			0
‘ the battery i am accused of stealing is still sitting at the bottom of my garden , exactly where it was when this case started			2
‘ this is the most stupid of many stupid charges the police and @entity174 have brought against me			0
' what would i want with a used car battery that does n’t even fit in my car ? ' the gamekeeper had removed all the good pheasant feeders and left only the broken ones			0
' those are the ones i was accused of breaking further			0
’ the earl said the proceedings in the @entity137 were about removing mr @entity61 , a barrister ’s clerk , as a trustee			0
‘ i will not rest until i have removed him from his position			0
even if it takes me the rest of my life , that man will go			0
’ bitter row : lord @entity0 was friends with estate trustee @entity61 ( right ) but their relationship has descended into a series of legal disputes offspring : the @entity83 's daughter is @entity148 , a pop singer and contestant on the @entity200 's @entity199 talent show			1

@entity202 appeared in court today accused of theft and criminal damage
