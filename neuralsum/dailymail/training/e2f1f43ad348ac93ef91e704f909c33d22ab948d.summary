@entity16 , 54 , has an iq of 192 and takes a huge array of supplements
however he estimates only a third of the *expensive* blend does anything
@entity16 lists himself as unemployed while he writes a book of memoirs
visits five gyms on a daily basis and routinely tweaks his mix of *chemicals*
says it plays into ' obsessive ' personality that led him to intelligence tests
