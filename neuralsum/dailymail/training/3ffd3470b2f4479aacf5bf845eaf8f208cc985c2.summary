by @entity0 dwindling in numbers , the original @entity1 is almost a thing of the past			0
but nostalgic @entity5 are being treated to a throwback this weekend with a fleet of the iconic buses on display			2
celebrating the @entity12 's @entity11 , around 130 buses drove through the capital 's @entity13 today - including the first ones ever registered			1
nostalgia : crowds clamoured to photograph a rare gathering of the first 130 routemaster buses in @entity19 's @entity13 to mark the 60th anniversary of the fleet iconic : buses that have been sent to @entity23 , @entity24 and @entity25 for other uses since they stopped transporting @entity5 were recalled for the convention @entity30 vehicles from as far afield as @entity24 , @entity25 and @entity23 have been called home to join the fleet , which will take another tour tomorrow			1
though some have been repainted in the years since they were used , many retain the adverts and posters of the time			0
crowds lined the paths in the sun this morning watch the old double - deckers parade in convoy			2
enthusiasts : conductors and enthusiasts arrived at the event bearing vintage badges to honour the landmark occasion , which has been years in the planning a thing of the past : the buses remained on @entity19 's streets until 2005 , when bendy buses and new routemasters were developed - though two routes still use them symbol of @entity60 : although there are only two heritage routes that still run the original buses in @entity19 , they remain a worldwide symbol for the nation crowds : after a parade around @entity13 , in north @entity19 , the fleet lined up for spectators to get a closer look , while vintage film reels were projected on screens original : this rickety bus was used in @entity19 in the 1920s before trolleybuses were invented - a chunky version of the open - backed routemasters that came in in 1954 and the nostalgia thoroughfare was completed with old film reels projected on tv screens , memorabilia stalls , and old fashioned food stands			1
the first prototype was developed between 1947 and 1956 , with a brief to create a lighter , fuel - efficient vehicle			0
though it was three tonnes lighter than the chunky 56 - seat trolleybuses , the final design managed to seat 64			0
colour code : @entity91 worked for @entity93 's country bus division , which went from the edges of @entity19 out to places including @entity96 ' perfect design ' : the first prototype was developed between 1947 and 1956 , with a brief to create a lighter , fuel - efficient vehicle revolutionary : though it was three tonnes lighter than the chunky 56 - seat trolleybuses , the final design managed to seat 64 through the ages : with badges from the 1950s up to an @entity106 - themed 2012 badge , this conductor was decked out in @entity1 memorabilia with the @entity1 's longevity , examples were painted to celebrate both the @entity110 and @entity111			1
in 1977 , 25 @entity113 were painted silver to celebrate the @entity115 and , in 2002 , 50 buses were painted gold			0
@entity91 worked for @entity93 's country bus division to destinations including @entity96			0
celebrations : tomorrow the bespoke fleet will parade again in a ' through the decades ' special , set to draw in hundreds of fanatics from around the world old fashioned : more than 2,000 @entity123 were built over the decades but now only 1,000 still exist , so this scene of one driving through @entity19 is a rarity			1

130 buses drove around @entity13 in convoy to celebrate 60 years since the iconic design was created
