she wrote : ' people saying it 's natural ...			2
maybe it was before powdered milk - in the same way it was ' natural ' to walk around naked before clothes ' and she concluded : ' but you would soon kick off if i started walking around naked			1
it 's time to change			0
' new mothers replied to @entity42 expressing their outrage , with one , @entity44 , saying : ' i 'm all for choice about feeding but saying bf is ' incest ' is seriously wrong and misleading , get a grip			0
' she added : ' the worrying thing is that younger women will read her stupid tweet and agree			1
' this is beyond stupid			0
' another , @entity55 , tweeted miss @entity0 to ask : ' are you uneducated also ? ' a woman 's breasts are for feeding her child			1
nothing disgusting about it ! ' lactation consultant @entity62 , who is also chairman of the @entity63 , told @entity64 it was ' sad ' that @entity42 had apparently ' lost sight of what her breasts are really for '			0

' i am sure miss @entity0 's baby does n't see it the same way - in the mind of a baby , breastfeeding is the most obvious and natural thing in the world			1
@entity4 , who had a baby boy last month , has told she found breastfeeding difficult at first ' our statistics show that the majority of new mothers want to breastfeed , whatever they think before giving birth ' ms @entity62 added : ' apart from the health benefits to babies , there are health benefits for breastfeeding mothers , too , including a reduced risk in breast and ovarian cancer and osteoporosis			2

she said she had thought it ' would be the easiest thing in the world ' , but had problems at the start before finally ' cracking it '			0
' it can be quite distressing when it 's not working , but we 've definitely cracked it now and it continually gets easier , ' she wrote in ok ! magazine			0
today the singer would not be drawn into a row with her critic , saying nothing on @entity12 beyond posting a link to a dress she is giving away to raise money for a breast cancer charity			2
