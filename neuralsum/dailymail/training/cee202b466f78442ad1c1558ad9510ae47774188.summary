@entity1 's @entity0 won his first @entity3 title on sunday after home favourite @entity4 suffered a dramatic collapse in the @entity7			1
@entity4 took a five - shot lead into the final round at @entity10 in his native @entity11 and , despite an error - strewn display , still led by four with five holes to play			1
however , the former @entity14 champion then failed to get up and down from a plugged lie in a greenside bunker on the 14th and three - putted the 16th to run up a double - bogey six , before a dreadful tee shot on the 17th led to another bogey and left him tied with @entity0 on 11 under par. @entity0 celebrates on the 18th hole after his winning putt in the sudden - death play - off @entity0 ( left ) is presented with the @entity7 trophy by @entity26 , mayor of @entity27 the players returned to the 18th for a sudden - death play - off and , after both had missed the fairway , @entity0 produced a stunning recovery from the trees and holed from 10 feet for a winning birdie			1
@entity0 , who held a one - shot lead at the halfway stage but bogeyed the first four holes as playing partner @entity4 birdied them , started the day seven shots off the lead but carded four birdies , an eagle and one bogey in a closing 67			1
the 27 - year - old from @entity45 perhaps thought his chance had gone when he left a long birdie putt on the 18th a few inches short , but @entity4 's shaky finish led to a 74 and ensured extra holes were required			2
@entity0 ( left ) and @entity4 ponder their next moves in the third round at the @entity10 ' it 's unbelievable , ' @entity0 said during the trophy presentation			2
' after saturday i did n't think i stood much of a chance with @entity4 getting ahead that far			0
' i just dug in there yesterday and today and found myself in a position where i had a chance to win			0
my caddie said over the last few holes ' no regrets ' and i 've definitely got no regrets over the last few holes , especially that play - off hole			0
' @entity4 has won major championships , my caddie said expect him to hole ( his third shot ) and he nearly did			0
i was delighted just to hit the green and have a chance to win and i 'm just glad i took it			0
' i did n't want to give him a second chance to take the title away from me so i am absolutely delighted and i hope the guys at @entity74 are having a few beers for me ! @entity0 produced a stunning recovery from the trees and holed from 10 feet for a winning birdie ' to just play on the @entity3 is something i 've wanted to do my whole life , so to win an event just caps it all off and to do it in @entity84 where i have always enjoyed playing , it has just been an incredible week			1
' @entity1 's @entity85 carded a closing 69 to finish third , just one shot outside the play - off , with @entity90 's @entity89 another shot back in fourth after also recording a 69			2
former @entity92 champion @entity91 had been the first player to put the pressure on playing partner @entity4 with birdies at the second and fourth , but the 20 - year - old from @entity96 double - bogeyed the seventh and ran up a triple bogey on the 13th to finish joint fifth .			0
