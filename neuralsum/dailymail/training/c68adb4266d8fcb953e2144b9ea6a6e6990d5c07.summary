by @entity1 reporter published : 17:56 est , 22 july 2012 updated : 04:41 est , 24 july 2012 it is a race in which loyalty and sacrifice come to the fore			2
but the sportsmanship exhibited by the riders has failed to rub off on to their wives and girlfriends			0
during the final days of the @entity14 , the partners of @entity12 and teammate @entity13 became involved an unseemly spat			1
@entity16 ( pictured with boyfriend @entity13 ) took to @entity17 to criticise his treatment during the tour @entity20 ( pictured with her husband @entity12 ) has clashed with ms @entity16 over her tweet the row erupted at the end of the 11th stage of the race when @entity13 was ordered to slow down to allow @entity20 to catch up and retain the overall lead			1
the tactic prompted an extraordinary outburst from @entity13 ’s girlfriend , @entity16 , a @entity31 sports photographer			1
in a thinly veiled jibe , she tweeted : ‘ @entity33 is also about giving the people around you , that support you , a chance to shine in their own right			0
’ ms @entity16 and mrs @entity20 exchanged thinly - veiled jibes on @entity17 mrs @entity20 quickly shot a tweet back in response which praised other members of the @entity43 @entity42 and @entity44 for ' genuine , selfless effort and true professionalism ' - but omitted mr @entity13			1
this tweet led to an immediate response from ms @entity16 who replied : ' do n't think there are many other pro-riders who 's partners know more about cycling than @entity13 's precisely & i know what happened just then			1
' ' if you want loyalty , get a @entity13 dog a quality i value although being taken advantage of by others ! ' the spat was joined by @entity63 , partner of @entity64 , one of @entity20 ’s other teammates			1
the former topless model wrote of @entity13 : ‘ you are a little bit special			2
’ no mention was made of @entity20			2
the tension does not seem to have ruffled mr @entity12 however , as he takes a lead of two minutes and five seconds over his competitors into the final stage			0
he has expressed support for mr @entity73 who he said ' will have his day			2
' the 27 - year - old rider is highly rated and tipped as a future winner of the @entity14			0
mr @entity12 , a 32 - year - old @entity76 , has won three olympic gold medals on an indoor track , and is expected to increase that tally at the @entity80 next month			0
in his autobiography the cyclist has spoken movingly of his troubled relationship with this @entity85 father , who was also a gifted road racer			0
@entity12 yesterday became @entity87 's first ever @entity14 winner			0

@entity13 's girlfriend *complains* that his loyalty is being ' taken advantage of '
