by @entity0 published : 08:21 est , 30 august 2013 updated : 18:46 est , 30 august 2013 after problems with travellers trying to set themselves up in a public park over the summer , a council took the step of locking the main gates to keep them out			1
but , as a fresh convoy of 30 caravans arrived , such common sense was clearly no match for the warped logic of health and safety			0
astonishingly , officials decided to unlock the vehicle access gate – because they were worried the intruders might hurt themselves during their efforts to get in			2
open season : the gate which was erected to keep travellers out has now been opened amid health and safety fears setting up camp : scores of caravans are now settled across @entity26 near @entity27 advice : police had warned the council that it was not safe for travellers to keep trying to access the site around the barrier the travellers duly made themselves at home – and because the council voluntarily let them in , police have lost all powers to evict them			1
taxpayers will instead now have to fund a lengthy civil court battle to throw out the intruders from @entity26 , on the outskirts of @entity27			1
the farce emerged in a leaked confidential email by @entity27 to councillors			1
it said : ‘ after the initial trespass was reported , @entity46 highlighted the dangerous nature with which the group were accessing the field			0
‘ as such a decision was taken to open the access gate to reduce the risk to road users and to stop the occupants from crossing the pavement to access the road			1
’ local residents say they are now unable to use the park , @entity27 and @entity61 ’s largest local nature reserve , and fear it could become ‘ a new @entity63 ’ , the illegal @entity64 camp of 1,000 travellers which cost millions of pounds to break up			1
delighted : travellers have set up camp at @entity26 , @entity27 , after being let into the site by council officials crazy : critics have described the decision to open the gate and let travellers in as ' madness ' at the start of the summer , the council padlocked the gates to @entity26 after itinerants had to be removed			1
about 30 caravans arrived and the travellers , determined to gain access , repeatedly drove over pavements and mounds designed as obstructions			1
it was then , last week , that the @entity88 - led council decided to open the gates to reduce risk to the public and the travellers themselves			1
more than 30 caravans are now camped on the land , with more feared over the weekend			0
inspector @entity94 of @entity46 said if the gates had remained locked , any travellers could have been evicted immediately because they would have been committing an offence under @entity97 of the @entity98			2
but because the council had let them in , the section no longer applies			0
@entity103 councillor @entity102 said last night : ‘ the council is mad			0
they have opened the flood gates			2
the kids who live nearby ca n’t play in the park any more because it ’s not safe			0
i am terrified it may turn into another @entity63			0
’ one traveller , 60 - year - old @entity109 , said : ‘ we have been to this site before			0
they have n’t opened the gate for us before but they did on tuesday			2
the council here are helpful			0
’ a council spokesman said : ‘ the council has initiated legal proceedings to evict the travellers			0
’ problem : around 100 caravans parked up in @entity26 in 2011			2
councillors fear even more will come now fears : residents are worried that the open gate will lead to influx of travellers and long legal battle similar to the one at @entity63 ( pictured )			1

@entity27 and @entity130 put gate across the *entrance* to @entity26 at start of the summer
but travellers kept driving round it and causing obstructions
@entity130 has now opened the gate because it causes ' risk to road users '
critics brand decision to open the gate ' madness '
