' deformation ' refers to the point at which the phone began to bend			2
' case separation ' was the point at which the display became disconnected from the case			0
one of the teenagers involved in the video said : ‘ the reason why we were laughing was because it was really funny			2
‘ we were in the @entity59 bending and breaking their @entity1 , which i guess is criminal damage but i do n’t even care , to be honest			1
‘ it ’s @entity2 ’s fault – they are false advertising , saying it ’s the best iphone but clearly it ’s not if it can bend in your hands or your pocket			2
’ the duo are n’t the only ones attempting to bend the @entity1 , with reports suggesting damaged @entity1 can be seen throughout @entity2 ’s stores			1
some customers have even attempted to bend the allegedly less prone @entity1 6			2
@entity2 has yet to comment on the matter			0
@entity2 has acknowledged there are issues with new iphones bending under some circumstances , but it added that it has only received nine official complaints			1
experts from @entity83 recently suggested some of these claims may have been exaggerated			2
during their own stress tests , they found the @entity1 can withstand more force than has been previously claimed - and that it is more sturdy than the @entity88 ( @entity89 ) and the smaller @entity1			1
the first reports of bendy iphones began on wednesday last week when photos appeared online showing the top of the device bent out of shape			0
@entity97 user @entity96 then posted a video showing the @entity1 bending using just his fingers , which has already been viewed more than 45.3 million times the controversy was dubbed ' @entity102 '			2

to put these claims to the test , @entity83 used a so - called ‘ three - point flexural test			1
’ this involved supporting the phone at two points on either end before applying a force on the top of the device			0
in addition to the @entity1 , the researchers tested the @entity1 6 , @entity88 ( @entity89 ) , @entity126 , @entity127 , and the @entity128			1
according to @entity83 , the @entity88 ( @entity89 ) ( pictured ) was the weakest of the handsets tested			1
it started to deform and bend when a total of 70lbs ( 31.75kg ) of force was applied			0
this was on par with the @entity1 6			0

@entity2 also faced criticism and complaints last week about its @entity151 update , after it caused problems with the new phones ’ @entity155 sensors and data services			1
the update was pulled , and the problems should now be solved by updating to @entity158			0
following the reports , and # bendgate controversy on @entity162 , @entity2 spokeswoman @entity159 said : ' with normal use , a bend in @entity1 is extremely rare and through our first six days of sale , a total of nine customers have contacted @entity2 with a bent @entity1 , ' @entity2 shares closed down nearly 4 per cent at $ 97.87 ( £ 60.26 ) thursday , wiping out nearly $ 23billion ( £ 14.1billion ) in market value			1
further tests , by @entity171 , revealed the performance of the new phones is n’t as poor as customers have made out , either			0
