@entity1 captain @entity0 bemoaned the fact his side had to play catch up as they slumped to a fifth defeat on the bounce , losing 31 - 28 to @entity7 at @entity8 on saturday			1
the @entity7 seized control early on , with tries from @entity11 and @entity12 giving them a 20 - 6 lead just after the interval			2
although @entity0 's pack muscled @entity1 back into the contest with tries from @entity18 and @entity19 off the back of driving mauls , @entity7 kept them at arm 's length with a touchdown from @entity25 before @entity26 closed the gap in the dying moments			1
@entity1 skipper @entity0 points out instructions to team - mates during their match against @entity7 @entity11 wheels away in celebrations as he earns @entity7 the first try of the game at @entity8 ' i think we were a bit reactive today , we allowed them to get ahead of us and then we had to play catch up , ' he told @entity40 1			1
' we had a brilliant patch out there where we got two driving mauls going but unfortunately we allowed them to get their driving maul going too			0
' it 's tough to take , especially at home , but we 'll have to work hard and come back next week			0
' @entity49 watches on as his team warm - up prior to the match at @entity8 @entity52 celebrates with team - mate @entity53 after kicking a drop goal for @entity7 after the 3 - 0 series whitewash in @entity57 in the summer and the 24 - 21 defeat to the @entity59 last week it now means they have suffered a fifth successive defeat for the first time since 2006 - which was also the last year they managed to beat @entity7 , who are now unbeaten in 12 matches against @entity1			1
like last week against the @entity59 @entity1 's set piece worked well , with two tries coming from lineouts , and the scrum was also strong , but @entity0 just feels his side are falling just short of what they are capable of			2
' we are probably not doing ourselves justice			0
we all know the way we train and the way we want to play and we have n't put it on the pitch as well as we would have liked , ' he added .			0
