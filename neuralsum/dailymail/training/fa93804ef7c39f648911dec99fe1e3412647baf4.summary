he said : ‘ do not love the one who does not love @entity125			0
if they can leave @entity125 , they will leave you			0
’ only a year ago , an @entity83 inspection of @entity113 found it ‘ outstanding ’ in all areas , including in promoting multi-racial harmony			0

’ according to a leaked report , teachers at the school lead chants criticising @entity72 @entity83 inspectors criticise poor teaching at @entity148 , and in their report say : ‘ too little is done to keep students safe from the risks associated with extremist views			1
’ the school , which has just under 900 pupils , is said to have been taken over by extremists with an ‘ @entity164 agenda			2
’ former head teacher @entity165 reportedly left because he opposed the change			1
@entity83 say @entity148 did not provide adequate sex education and that some female teachers at were spoken to in a way they found ‘ intimidating ’			2
