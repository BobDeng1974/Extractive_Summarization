an experimental vaccine to protect against @entity1 is safe , research has revealed			1
the first trial of filovirus vaccines in @entity5 revealed the drug generated a similar immune response in healthy @entity9 adults , as those reported in @entity12 volunteers earlier this year			1
it is hoped establishing the safety of the vaccines will help contain the current outbreak in @entity5 , which has claimed almost 7,400 lives according to the @entity18			1
the @entity20 vaccines , designed to protect against @entity1 and the closely related @entity22 virus , have provided a basis for the development of more potent drugs , currently being tested in the @entity12 , @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity9			1
an experimental vaccine to protect against @entity1 , pictured under the microscope , is safe , after the first trials of the dna vaccine showed it was effective in protecting healthy adults in @entity9 the current outbreak in @entity5 has killed around 7,400 people according to the @entity18 lead author , dr @entity34 , from the @entity35 ( @entity36 ) and the @entity37 said : ' this is the first study to show comparable safety and immune response of an experimental @entity1 vaccine in an @entity43 population			1
' this is particularly encouraging because those at greatest risk of @entity1 live primarily in @entity5 , and diminished vaccine protection in @entity43 populations has been seen for other diseases			0
' scientists from the @entity36 developed the two dna vaccines , that code for ebola virus proteins from the @entity55 and @entity56 strains of the disease , and the marburg virus protein			0
immune responses against these proteins have shown to be highly protective in non-human primate models			0
phase one trials carried out at the @entity65 @entity64 programme , enlisted 108 healthy adults aged between 18 and 50 from @entity67 , @entity9			0
the trials took place between november 2009 and april 2010			0
each volunteer was randomly assigned an injection , receiving either the @entity1 vaccine ( 30 volunteers ) , the @entity22 vaccine ( 30 ) , both vaccines ( 30 ) , or the placebo ( 18 ) at the start of the study , and again at four and eight weeks later			1
the vaccines given separately and together were safe and stimulated an immune response in the form of neutralising antibodies , and t - cells against the virus proteins			2
four weeks after the third injection , more than half of volunteers ( 57 per cent of 17 of 30 ) had an antibody response to the @entity90 protein as did 14 of 30 participants who received both the @entity1 and @entity22 vaccines			1
however the antibodies were not long - lasting and returned to undetectable levels within 11 months of vaccination			0
the current @entity1 outbreak in @entity5 involves the @entity55 strain			2
trials carried out in @entity9 in 2009 and 2010 ( file picture posed by model ) showed the volunteers showed similar immunse response to the vaccines designed to protect against @entity1 and the closely related @entity22 virus , to those @entity12 volunteers earlier this year			1
the vaccines have provided the basis for more potent drugs currently being trialled lead author , dr @entity34 , said : ' this is the first study to show comparable safety and immune response of an experimental @entity1 vaccine in an @entity43 population ' the marburg virus is closely related to the @entity1 disease and causes internal bleeding the researchers found both @entity20 vaccines were well tolerated in @entity9 adults			1
only one serious adverse reaction - a low white blood cell count - was reported in a @entity22 vaccine only recipient , but was not thought to be vaccine - related			0
dr @entity34 , said : ' these findings have already formed the basis of a more potent vaccine , delivered using a harmless chimpanzee cold virus , which is undergoing trials in the @entity12 , @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity9 in response to the ongoing ebola virus outbreak			1
' dr @entity134 , from the @entity135 at the @entity136 , said : ' this study deserves to be the focal point around which the broader question of vaccine development , particularly for @entity5 , must be addressed			0
' with the uncharitable benefit of hindsight in view of the evolving 2014 @entity1 outbreak , we must ask ourselves whether a filovirus vaccine should have been in more advanced clinical development			2
' the international response to the present @entity1 outbreak is an exemplar of the speed and purpose with which clinical vaccine development can progress and has set the benchmark against which future vaccine development must be judged			2
outbreaks of ebola virus and marburg virus infections have occurred sporadically since they were first detected in 1976 and 1967 respectively , and have a case fatality rate as high as 90 per cent and 80 per cent respectively			0
like the ebola virus , @entity22 is a filovirus that causes internal bleeding at multiple sites with patients usually dying as a result of multiple organ failure			2
currently , no effective vaccines against either virus exist .			0

study found experimental vaccines were well tolerated by volunteers
one designed to protect against @entity1 and other against the @entity22 virus
they have formed the basis for new , more potent , @entity1 vaccines being trialled in the @entity12 , @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity9 in response to the current outbreak
