it sparked a hate campaign and was dubbed so terrifying , it was nicknamed @entity3			2
and now even the sculptor of the @entity6 statue in @entity7 , @entity8 , has called it ' by far my most unsettling sculpture ' and six years after it was unveiled has pledged to make a new one for free			1
but the statue of @entity14 - which was so offensive a @entity17 page called we love @entity3 ! @entity19 was launched - is n't the only offensive artwork that has missed the mark			1
take , for example , the @entity35 's @entity34 in @entity36 , which was bought to the world 's attention in january after tv presenter @entity39 posted pictures of the works online			1
its website boasts : ‘ @entity35 's waxworks is a collection of instantly recognizable , true - to - life wax figures crafted by recognized wax artists from around the world			1
’ @entity50 does not seem herself in this warped wax version of her character in the television series @entity54 which appears at the @entity55 in @entity56 this figure of @entity58 seems a little polished as he shows off uncharacteristically glossy locks however @entity39 seemed to be in disagreement in one tweet he wrote : ‘ it 's almost like @entity36 want to start a war			2
here 's the @entity70 ... ’ with a picture of a waxwork with only the faintest passing resemblance to her majesty			0
and @entity35 's waxwork museum in @entity72 , which closed in october 2012 , was described as the world 's worst waxworks museum because so many of its models looked nothing like the people they were supposed to represent			1
his museums are not connected to his great - grandmother 's @entity81 waxwork museums			0
however , the famous @entity83 's is not exempt from critisicim either			0
this enormous effigy of @entity86 as mr @entity87 was erected in @entity89 's @entity88 in 2013 however it bore little resemblance to the iconic image from @entity93 @entity95 talks show host @entity96 is unrecognisable as his waxwork in @entity35 's @entity98 , which comedian @entity39 openly mocked on @entity99 at the beginning of this year this statue of @entity102 was unveiled in @entity103 in october 2011 complete with warrior clothing , although @entity102 does n't appear thrilled the stern likeness is uncanny in november last year the house of wax in @entity108 unveiled a figure of 22 - year - old @entity110 , however fans were shocked when the museum appeared to have aged her by ten years			1
it took a team of 20 artists four months to create the dummy , showing the songstress dressed in a pair of leather hot pants and sheer blouse - an outfit she wore at a gig in @entity89 in september 2014			0
in 2011 @entity83 's unveiled a @entity125 waxwork which was criticised for not looking anything like the pop star who was then 17			2
@entity125 worked closely with the team who created his waxwork , giving sittings in @entity8 last year			1
and stylists teamed up with @entity125 's personal stylist to ensure his once legendary hairstyle was the exact replica of the original cut			0
but after turning 17 two weeks earlier , the singer - much to the dismay of fans - had his hair cut			0
and the star was also taller than his wax figurine making for a far off likeness			2
however , @entity110 's figure is positively uncanny compared to some celebrity tributes			0
here we showcase the very worst			0
even the famous @entity83 's occasionally gets it wrong with @entity148 looking a little worse for wear in 2008 this golden statue of @entity153 model @entity152 was unveiled by artist @entity154 other than the unsettling eyes , @entity150 is n't famed for being a contortionist ... @entity157 seems to be unable to disguise his giggles while unveiling this statues in @entity160 in 2013 @entity83 's came under fire for their depiction of singer @entity110 in november 2014 when their wax depiction of the 22 - year - old seemed to have aged by about ten years fans were stunned when the 2011 waxwork was unveiled at @entity81 as it bore no likeness to him this stone statue of princess @entity172 was created in @entity173 in 2004 but is hardly a chip off the old block @entity176 looks anything other than a @entity178 in this wax work figure			1

a statue of @entity14 in @entity182 , @entity8 was dubbed so offensive the artist has offered to fix the statue for free
however , there are unrecognisable celebrity effigies all over the world
