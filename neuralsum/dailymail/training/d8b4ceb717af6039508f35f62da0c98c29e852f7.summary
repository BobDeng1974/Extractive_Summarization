@entity0 is coming under intense pressure from his mps to sack @entity3 to boost @entity5 ’s prospects in next year ’s general election			1
the whispering campaign against the @entity8 has started as mr @entity3 fights an increasingly open battle with health spokesman @entity10 over their manifesto policies			1
the group , who are largely affiliated to the unions , are swinging behind mr @entity10 ’s call for the party to back a ring - fenced tax to boost funding for the @entity20 – a move that mr @entity3 categorically ruled out yesterday			1
under pressure : @entity0 ( left ) is coming under intense pressure from his mps to sack @entity3 ( right ) the mps resent mr @entity3 ’s refusal to pledge extra money to the @entity20 in case the @entity27 cite it as an example of @entity5 ’s profligacy			1
the mps have grown concerned by the party ’s failure to open up a commanding opinion poll lead over the @entity33 , with some recent surveys showing a gap down to just two per cent			0
no opposition party in recent political history has won @entity38 from such a weak electoral position			0
with just ten months until the election , most of the mps accept that a direct challenge to mr @entity0 is now unlikely , and so many have instead started calling for mr @entity3 ’s head as part of a wider shadow cabinet reshuffle which would promote mr @entity10 and see a return for former chancellor @entity47 and ex-home secretary @entity48			1
battle : mr @entity3 is fighting an increasingly open battle with health spokesman @entity10 ( pictured ) over their manifesto policies the tension between mr @entity10 and mr @entity3 erupted yesterday when mr @entity3 slapped down the idea of either a 15 per cent ‘ death tax ’ levy on all estates to pay for social care of the elderly or an extra 1p on @entity59 as an ‘ @entity20 tax ’ , both of which are understood to have the support of mr @entity10			1
‘ people feel they are paying too much tax already , ’ said mr @entity3			1
‘ we have to get the balance right between balancing the budget and making sure the @entity20 continues to deliver			2
’ mr @entity0 has promised a ‘ summer offensive ’ of major speeches by his frontbench team to build momentum into the autumn conference season			2
but many of his mps were mortified when he used a speech last month to draw attention to his supposed resemblance to @entity78 from the @entity78 and @entity78 series , saying he was ‘ not from central casting ’			0
last night , @entity5 mp @entity81 led calls for a wide - ranging frontbench reshuffle after next month ’s @entity85 referendum			2
he told @entity86 : ‘ there needs to be a shadow cabinet reshuffle before the @entity5 conference			2
after @entity85 votes no to independence he [ @entity0 ] should bring back @entity47 , who led the anti-independence campaign , and [ former home secretary ] @entity48			2
both of them have bags of experience , which our frontbench lacks			0
we also need to match the @entity27 ’ new - found focus and drive			0
’ mr @entity81 added : ‘ i can not bear all this angst about jawlines and @entity78 and @entity78			0
the public do n’t want self - absorption			0
they want a focus on tough , clear policies that are relevant to their lives			0
‘ my view that things need to change is shared throughout the party			0
the only division is between those who think the debate should take place in private and the few of us who want it to take place in public			0
