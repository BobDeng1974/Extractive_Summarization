the @entity0 have taunted @entity1 by claiming their @entity3 performance was a backward step and @entity6 ’s men must play a more attacking game to be world beaters			1
@entity1 lost 24 - 21 to the world champions , making it four successive defeats following last summer ’s 3 - 0 whitewash , and the final scoreline flattered the hosts			1
@entity16 ’s stunning try raised hopes of an @entity1 win but they ran out of steam badly in the second half			1
@entity1 players look dejected during the demoralising defeat against @entity0 at @entity3 @entity1 manager @entity6 looks on as @entity1 were beaten at home to @entity0 @entity1 21 - 24 @entity0 highlights @entity0 no 8 @entity24 , the world player of the year , said : ‘ they took us on up front but they did n’t show as much as they did in june ( when @entity1 lost the series 3 - 0 )			1
‘ they started well , then maybe went away from their strength			0
they scored a great try by passing the ball but later on they closed up a bit			2
they will learn a lot from this game			2
’ @entity24 ’s team - mate , fly half @entity43 , agreed that @entity1 — who will consider starting @entity46 at @entity47 against @entity48 on saturday with @entity49 at inside centre — went into their shells in the second half			1
@entity52 of @entity1 is stopped by @entity43 ... and the @entity53 had more to say after the game @entity0 no 8 @entity24 , the world player of the year , said he saw more from @entity1 in june ‘ at the start of the second half we felt we got a bit of dominance and @entity1 went away from using the ball a bit , ’ @entity43 said			1
‘ they reverted a lot to kicking and trying to put pressure on us that way			0
in the first half they were chancing their arm a bit			0
they turned down a shot at goal and kicked to the corner			0
‘ in the second half they reverted to being forward - orientated and kicking the ball			2
we were expecting them to use the ball more , but we adapted well			0
’ @entity1 went in at half time with the lead but ultimately lost out to an impressive @entity0 team @entity6 has several selection dilemmas — including the make - up of the back row — ahead of the @entity48 , who were surprise losers to @entity79 in @entity80			1
but despite the latest setback the head coach is adamant his injury - hit side is on track 11 games away from the start of next year ’s @entity87			0
‘ i do n’t think in any games we ’ve played we ’ve felt we ’ve been dominated , ’ @entity6 said			0
‘ the first half of the third test [ in @entity0 ] is probably the only time			2
we do n’t think the gap is very big at all			0
’ @entity93 suffers in the @entity3 rain as @entity1 fall to defeat against @entity0			1
