the 20 - year - old had been savagely beaten and shot five times			2
five men were found guilty of the alleged ' execution - style ' murder of mr @entity0 and jailed for a total of 135 years at @entity21 in 2008			1
but they launched a collective appeal and were cleared at the @entity23 in march 2012 after a damning report exposed a catalogue of blunders by @entity27			2
after the trial , it emerged concerns over the credibility of the key prosecution witness , @entity32 , were not disclosed to the defence			0
mr @entity32 claimed to have seen the killing having driven the car which took mr @entity0 to his death			0
but it later emerged that complaints made by mr @entity32 concerning his treatment while in witness protection were ' put on ice '			0
a detective handling the key witness was also involved in an ' intimate ' affair with a disclosure officer , it emerged			0
a senior detective believed there was an ' at any cost ' culture within @entity27 to ensure mr @entity32 gave evidence in the case			0
in september last year , a file of evidence was handed over to the @entity55 ( @entity55 ) after an investigation by the @entity57 ( @entity57 )			1
the police watchdog probe centred on how the officers acted before the trial and dealings with protected witness mr @entity32 in 2008			1
but it emerged today that none of the 14 former and serving @entity27 officers investigated over the murder will face prosecution			1
the officers include high - ranking @entity68 , the chief constable of @entity70 , and @entity72 's chief constable @entity71			0
@entity27 's temporary chief constable @entity73 and @entity75 's assistant chief constable @entity74 have also been told they face no further action			0
@entity72 's chief constable @entity71 ( left ) and @entity68 ( right ) , the chief constable of @entity70 , were among the police who will face no further action @entity75 's assistant chief constable @entity74 ( left ) and @entity27 's temporary chief constable @entity73 ( right ) are also no longer being investigated the @entity55 said it had considered two allegations in connection with the handling of the case			1
one was that @entity27 had received a complaint from the main witness relating to a senior officer of the @entity88 in november 2006			0
the second matter was the force 's failure to disclose the results of internal review of the sensitive policing unit and its handling of mr @entity32			0
five of the 14 officers were told they would not face criminal prosecution in january and the nine remaining officers were told the same decision had been reached this week			2
commenting on the latest officers to be cleared , a @entity55 spokesman said : ' we considered whether there is sufficient evidence to prove that any action or inaction was a deliberate attempt to pervert the course of justice or could amount to the criminal offence of misconduct in public office			1
' the @entity55 has determined there is insufficient evidence to prosecute any of the nine police officers , four remain in service while five are now retired , investigated either for attempting or conspiring to pervert the course of public justice or for criminal misconduct in a public office			1
' @entity122 ( left ) and @entity123 ( right ) were among the five men convicted then cleared of murder @entity126 ( left ) and @entity127 ( right ) were also in the group , cleared of the ' execution style ' killing the investigation into the case against group - who also included @entity134 ( pictured ) - was flawed the spokesman added : ' the @entity55 has taken the decision that whatever criticisms may be made about the conduct of the various officers , there is insufficient evidence to provide a realistic prospect of a conviction against any of them for conspiring or attempting to pervert the course of public justice			1
' equally , that there is no realistic prospect of a conviction resulting from the prosecution of any officer for the misconducting themselves in public office			0
' rather than a conspiracy to conceal , the evidence suggested that there was an overall failure to disclose the report			0
' none of the officers who could be shown to be aware of the content of the report had a clear and direct responsibility for disclosure in the murder case			2
' this @entity55 decision applies only to possible criminal proceedings and not to any possible misconduct proceedings under police regulations			2
