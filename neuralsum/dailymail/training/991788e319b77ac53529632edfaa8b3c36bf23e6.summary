by @entity0 the mother of a 19 - year - old model who died of cervical cancer after doctors failed to allow her a smear test has questioned why her daughter was refused the simple examination			1
the @entity9 scrapped routine smears for under - 25s in 2003 over concerns they could do more harm than good			1
but @entity15 ' mother , @entity14 , 47 , has launched a campaign – called @entity17 – to get the minimum age for automatic smear tests cut to 16			1
@entity15 , pictured , died from cervical cancer at the age of 19 after being refused a smear test by doctors on the grounds she was too young @entity15 's family released this image of the 19 - year - old in hospital , taken shortly before her death from cervical cancer on march 15 @entity15 , of @entity31 , @entity32 , had suffered crippling stomach pains for over a year before she was initially diagnosed with @entity35 's disease , it was claimed speaking to @entity37 , mrs @entity14 , of @entity31 , @entity38 , said : ‘ it took her nearly a year and ten gp appointments to get diagnosed , which just is n’t good enough			1
‘ who knows what could have been had she been given a smear test			2
girls are getting boob jobs on the @entity9 to make themselves feel better			0
what ’s the cost of a smear test compared to that ? ’ aspiring model @entity15 , who had just walked in her first catwalk show , was told she was too young to have a smear test when she complained of crippling stomach pains last february			1
she was only diagnosed correctly with cervical cancer in november , by which time the disease had spread all over her body			1
she died on march 15			1
miss @entity15 was described by her sister , @entity56 , as ' a very calming influence on everyone around her ' mrs @entity14 was at her daughter 's bedside when she passed away but said it was too difficult to watch as her daughter took her last breath			1
she said : ‘ i held her hand			0
i could never say goodbye to @entity15 because she will always be with me			0
‘ if we can do something to make sure this does n’t happen to someone else , then @entity15 ’s death wo n’t have been in vain			0
’ the petition launched by @entity15 ’s family , including her mother @entity74 , father @entity75 , 41 , twin sister @entity74 , 19 , sisters @entity78 24 , @entity56 , 28 , and @entity79 , 23 , and brothers @entity81 , 26 , and @entity82 , 26 , has now received more than 300,000 signatures			2
mrs @entity14 said they put the word ‘ choice ’ in the name of the campaign on purpose			0
she said : ‘ the word “ choice ” in the campaign means that people should have just that – a choice			0
if a girl presents at a doctor ’s with symptoms she should be given the pros and cons of being tested			0
’ last @entity101 picture : miss @entity15 posted this photo two weeks before her death on march 15 killer disease : @entity105 , from @entity31 , was admitted to hospital in november after her condition worsened labour health spokesman @entity108 said : ‘ women can have a cervical smear test at any age if their doctor thinks it ’s necessary to help in diagnosis , so we must understand what went wrong in this case to ensure such a tragedy does not happen again			1
’ the programme was introduced for girls in school in 2008 with the aim of eventually cutting the incidence of cervical cancer by up to 70 per cent			2
a spokesman for the @entity127 said : ‘ this is a tragic case			0
the issue was last debated in @entity130 in 2009 , but the best independent evidence still shows that routine screening of women under 25 does more harm than good			0
‘ cervical cancer in women under 25s is extremely rare			2
in 2011 , there were 47 cases of cervical cancer in women under 25 and no deaths			1
’ @entity105 , pictured with her boyfriend @entity145 , was ' in high spirits ' the day she died , her sister said miss @entity15 ' family and friends are now calling for younger women to be offered cervical cancer screening screening : the test is currently offered to women aged 25 or over the @entity9 offers a free cervical screening test to all women aged 25 - 64 every three to five years			1
it is not a test for cervical cancer , but it identifies early abnormalities which , if left untreated , could develop into cancer of the cervix ( neck of the womb )			1
a sample of cells is taken from the cervix for analysis and sent to a laboratory for analysis			0
those whose cells show abnormalities are called back for further investigation and , if necessary , treatment			0
currently the test is not offered routinely to women aged younger than 25 because cervical cancer is so rare in women that young			1
according to @entity182 statistics , not a single woman under the age of 20 died from cervical cancer between 2009 - 2011			1
the lower age of 25 was raised from 20 after the @entity185 on @entity186 ( @entity187 ) advised the @entity9 in 2003 that cervical screening in younger women did more harm than good			2
the committee advised that cell abnormalities in younger women normally went away of their own accord , and said that sending young women for further tests and treatment increased the likelihood of the woman having pre-term delivery if she went on to have children , and could cause significant anxiety			0
many other countries offer cervical screening from the age of 25 , including @entity201 , @entity202 , @entity203 and @entity204			2
in @entity206 , women are invited to be checked from the age of 20 , though it is due to go up to 25 next year			0
in @entity209 women are invited from 18 , @entity210 from 20 , and in the @entity212 two years after women become sexually active			0
meanwhile , other countries start cervical screening later			0
both the @entity215 and @entity216 offer screening to women only once they are 30 , and these two countries boast some of the lowest mortality rates for cervical cancer in @entity222 , and in @entity224 it is for women over 31 .			2

@entity15 , 19 , of @entity32 , died of cervical cancer on march 15
she suffered stomach cramps and knew something was wrong with her
but doctors refused her cervical smear test because she was under 25
doctors initially *blamed* it on crohn 's disease but her condition worsened
her mother is now campaigning for the age of routine smears to be lowered
@entity14 , 47 , is questioning why doctors refused to screen her daughter
