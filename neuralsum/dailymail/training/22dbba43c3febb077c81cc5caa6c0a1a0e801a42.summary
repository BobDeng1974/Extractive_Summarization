by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 and @entity4 manager @entity3 has told his star striker @entity5 that he will be sacrificed if he is n’t fit enough or playing well enough			1
@entity6 and his captain @entity7 are thought to have a unique bond that @entity4 fans will hope can be replicated when the veteran coach starts life at @entity12 after the @entity13			1
but @entity6 hauled @entity7 off 15 minutes from the end of sunday night ’s dramatic 2 - 1 win over @entity16 and watched as his replacement @entity18 set up one goal and score the winner from the penalty spot			1
' let ’s not forget before he joined team he was recovering from an injury			2
it ’s difficult for him to keep up 90 minutes especially in these conditions			2
' anyway , this trainer wants to win			2
so he makes the changes and the substitutions he needs			0
' @entity7 is still expected to start in saturday ’s quarter - final against @entity44 but holding midfielder @entity45 is not expected to recover from the groin injury that forced him off the field early on in the @entity16 game			1
' i do n’t know but i think it might be difficult , ' added @entity6			0
it is a muscle injury			0
' doubt : @entity45 limped off during the win against @entity16 and is now a doubt to face @entity44 in the quarter - finals underdogs : @entity44 have stunned many to reach the quarter - finals after defeating @entity59 on penalties @entity6 has denied that his team have a straight forward route to the last four , even though quarter - final opponents @entity44 are ranked 28 in the world and had to play extra time against @entity59 yesterday			1
' let me tell you the @entity69 media thought we would never survive the first round , so how we ended up becoming up favourites , i ’ll never know , ' he said			0
' this group of players is very modest			0
we have outstanding spirit , outstanding atmosphere , and that led to victory			0
' @entity44 very difficult opponents , otherwise they would n’t have ended up in a quarter final			1
