by @entity0 published : 23:38 est , 30 may 2013 updated : 07:34 est , 31 may 2013 a @entity3 @entity2 state senator fled from a tv reporter on wednesday as he tried to ask her questions about her claim on the @entity8 floor that opponents of president @entity11 's signature health care overhaul law are motivated by the color of his skin			1
@entity14 , who also chairs the @entity15 , claimed monday that opposition to @entity17 is ' about the race of this @entity20 - @entity20 president			1
' ' it 's not about how many federal dollars we can receive			0
it 's not about that , ' she told her fellow lawmakers			0
' you ready ? it 's about race			0
no , nobody wants to talk about that			0
it â€™s about the race of this @entity20 - @entity20 president			1
' but when @entity38 - @entity37 reporter @entity36 tried to ask her about those comments , she dashed down a set of stairs and ran into an area of the state capitol where he could n't follow her			1
@entity36 said during his broadcast report that when he sent @entity14 a written request for comment , she was seen taking it off her desk and throwing it in the garbage			2
she said on the floor of the @entity8 that ' the race of this @entity20 - @entity20 president ' explained widespread opposition to his healthcare overhaul law @entity14 made her comments during a @entity8 floor speech , quickly drawing condemnation from republicans and conspicuous silence from @entity3 @entity14 ( center , in red ) ran , literally , from news cameras when a reporter asked her about her suggestion that only racists oppose @entity17 as evidence for her claim of racism , @entity14 said @entity74 house speaker @entity74 once proposed ' this same thing ' - an individual health care mandate			1
she quickly walked that claim back , however , saying that @entity79 's proposal was merely ' similar ' to @entity11 's			0
but she insisted that opposition to @entity11 's @entity17 ' comes down to the race of the president of the @entity82 , which causes people to disconnect and step away from the substance of the bill			1
the latest poll on @entity17 's popularity , a survey by @entity89 and @entity90 released may 27 , showed that 54 per cent of @entity82 oppose it , down from 59 per cent while the bill was being debated in @entity93			2
just 43 per cent support the law , which will take full effect in 2014			0
@entity2 gov. @entity96 ( @entity97 ) slammed @entity14 for ' name - calling ' and ' calling people a racist , ' and asked for an apology			1
state sen. @entity102 ( r ) said , ' some decks have only one card in it , and that 's the race card ' @entity14 's @entity107 entry was quietly edited on thursday to read for several hours that she has ' embarrassed ' - not ' represented ' - @entity2 's ' 5th @entity108 since 2010 ' ' the suggestion that more than half of the people in @entity2 are racist because of their concerns is absurd , ' @entity111 spokeswoman @entity109 told the @entity116			1
tying the dustup to national politics , @entity109 added that @entity14 's statement also ' raises serious questions about where [ @entity102 ] @entity121 stands			2
' ' @entity121 cast the deciding vote to make @entity17 law , and she owes it to voters to weigh in on the offensive comments made by the head of her @entity3 party			2
' @entity2 gov. @entity96 told @entity38 that @entity14 should retract her claims of racism			1
' there 's a way to have that debate ' about @entity17 , he said			0
' there 's a way to express your opinion without name calling , without calling people a racist			0
' ' i 'd hope the senator would apologize			0
i 'd hope she 'd go to the well and retract her comments			0
' @entity96 and other @entity148 governors oppose @entity17 because expanding their states ' medicaid programs with federal dollars would put added pressure on state budgets when those dollars disappear in later years			1
when @entity36 , a reporter with @entity156 in @entity157 , ran after @entity14 to ask her about her comments , she dashed down a set of stairs and ran into an area of the state capitol where journalists are not allowed state sen. @entity102 , a @entity163 , told @entity38 that he opposes @entity17 - but he 's no racist			1
and , he noted wryly , ' not only am i @entity20 , i 'm black			0
' ' some decks have only one card in it , and that 's the race card , ' @entity102 said			0
' and i 'm so sick of hearing it			0
' an unknown vandal changed @entity14 's @entity107 entry on thursday , replacing a single word so it began , ' @entity14 ( born november 1 , 1969 ) is an @entity20 @entity3 member of the @entity172 , having embarrassed the 5th district since 2010			1
' the article was quickly returned to its original text			0
@entity14 claimed that former @entity82 house speaker @entity74 once proposed ' this same thing ' in the past without widespread opposition			1
she quickly modified that comment , however , saying that his health care plan was merely ' similar ' to @entity11 's @entity14 ( r ) , then a state @entity148 named @entity14 , lost her 2006 race for @entity93 against the incumbent @entity163 @entity184			2
she conceded the race next to her then - fiancee , @entity14 ( @entity97 )			2

@entity14 claimed in a floor speech that opposition to @entity17 is ' about the race of this @entity20 - @entity20 president '
@entity14 also serves as chair of the @entity15
@entity2 gov. @entity96 has asked her to apologize and retract her statement
when a @entity197 reporter tried to ask her a question about her *incendiary* comments , @entity14 ran down a set of stairs and fled
