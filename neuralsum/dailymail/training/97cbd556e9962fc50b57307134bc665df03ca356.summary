perhaps if @entity1 had spent less time reminiscing openly about her lovers and more time reminding the world about her songs , she would have been fixed deeper into the consciousness of today 's music - buying public			1
maybe if she had boasted about being the first female songwriter garlanded with an @entity10 — she won two , actually , in the early seventies — her name would n't be so surprisingly absent from @entity11 , and , sadly , unknown among the young			1
when her death was announced yesterday , her friend @entity12 described @entity1 as a ' renaissance woman ' who could sing , compose , ' do everything '			1
she was also a talented artist and cartoonist — a product of @entity18 in @entity19			1
at barely 5ft tall and as delicate as china , @entity35 — who died on wednesday of a suspected brain haemorrhage — was never an archetypal feminist role model			1
but then her upbringing , in the north @entity19 suburb of @entity39 , clearly had a lasting effect — she was abused and beaten by her property - developer father and did not want other girls and women to suffer at the hands of men			1
perhaps it was the way her father treated her that explains why , despite having an extraordinarily glamorous string of lovers , she died unmarried at the age of 66			1
@entity1 smooching @entity51 legend @entity50 in 1978 during their intense relationship the singer dated @entity55 for five months and he would read @entity57 poems to her and phone her from his film set the list included @entity55 , @entity61 , @entity62 ( who wrote songs with @entity64 ) , @entity65 , @entity51 actor @entity50 and @entity67 producer @entity66			1
@entity69 's name was also linked with @entity70 , @entity70 's last lover , @entity72			2
a lively , gregarious woman , @entity1 lived happily alone in a vast house in @entity75 , north @entity19			1
she moved there last year from an equally large house in nearby @entity78 — friends say it was because she did n't get on too well with the neighbours			1
her vast , 7ft bed moved with her			2
so did her white grand piano , on which she 'd composed hit songs @entity85			2
she also continued her nightly habit of taking food to the bottom of her garden to feed the urban foxes			0
@entity1 enjoyed her own company			1
and with age came an attractive line in self - deprecation — she would describe herself as being ' like a @entity96 with a re-spray '			1
when she gave dinner parties , she always invited couples but never a single man for herself			0
with @entity61 in 1975 , but @entity1 later dismissed their romance as ' just a fling ' tiny and always curvaceously slim , she was fastidiously tidy			1
her 20 pairs of jeans were hung in perfect alignment in her wardrobe			0
so were the 20 jumpers she liked to wear			0
' everything in her house had to be exactly in its place , ' a friend said yesterday			0
' i 've never seen a home so spotless or so orderly — hardly a house for a husband			0
' yet @entity1 certainly loved men : ' i did n't lose my virginity , i gave it away to a man much older than i was , ' she liked to say			1
few warm memories remained of her fling with @entity55 some 25 years ago			1
she 'd met him in 1989 at a party			0
his second wife , @entity125 , was sitting next to @entity1 on a sofa but , she said , that did n't stop @entity128 chatting her up and asking for her phone number			1
' i did n't want to have an affair with him , ' said @entity35 , ' and i tried to keep our relationship platonic , but he pursued me relentlessly			1
he was n't my type at all because i 'm not usually attracted to the macho type			2
' in the end i thought , ' why not ? ' i did n't know his wife , so i did n't feel i was betraying her by having an affair			2
' @entity1 certainly loved men : ' i did n't lose my virginity , i gave it away to a man much older than i was , ' she liked to say so began a relationship that went on for five months			1
@entity128 would read @entity57 poems to her and phone her from his film set			0
intriguingly , she claimed he told her in one call that he was only able to kiss his co-star , @entity147 , while thinking of @entity1			1
the affair ended rather abruptly			0
the couple met for what @entity1 did n't know was the last time , made love , then he told her he would ring her at the weekend			1
she never heard from him again			0
later , @entity1 was appalled when she learned that @entity128 had publicly condoned hitting women ; his first wife , actress @entity153 , revealed he had beaten her during their marriage			1
@entity1 said he 'd never laid a hand on her , adding : ' i was n't aware of @entity55 's violent side when i was with him , but i was quite horrified when i read that he 'd said it was ok to hit a woman			1
' she launched a furious attack in a newspaper interview , saying that she bitterly regretted their affair and that she 'd ' like to give him a smack for women in general '			2
not long afterwards , she released a new book and dvd , called taking control — a manual for women to defend themselves against violence			2
putting her words into action , she 'd spent a year learning martial arts as an example to her readers			0
' i do n't see men as the enemy , ' she said			2
' i 'm like a pussycat			0
i would rather curl up in a man 's lap and purr and be stroked			0
she dated @entity65 and observed drily that ' he was the only man i dated whose eyes were the same height as mine ' ' but if i have to , the claws come out and the hissing will start			1
' the book earned praise from @entity193 , then a senior member of @entity195 , who said it was a ' very positive contribution to crime prevention '			0
but @entity128 was not the only violent man @entity35 bedded			0
even the love of her life , @entity50 , threatened her during the four years they lived together in the late - seventies			1
@entity50 was the only man she wanted to marry — at least for the first two years of their relationship			1
but then she realised he was becoming too possessive			0
' @entity209 did n't understand my need to make music , ' she later recalled			2
' he expected me to fit into his life			0
i wanted to get on with my music			0
' there was another possible marriage that never came to pass			0
for years , she wore an engagement ring given to her by @entity219 , bassist with @entity220			0
however , her relationship with @entity61 was merely ' a fling '			1
as for diminutive @entity65 , she observed drily that ' he was the only man i dated whose eyes were the same height as mine '			1
despite a comprehensive personal history of star - studded relationships , there was a curious modesty about de @entity35 's professional success and @entity233 hits			0
far more important to her was her concern about women being safe			2
taking control was a psychological as well as a physical self - defence manual , as she blamed women for their mental attitude			2
' possibly the single most damaging belief held by women is that they are the weaker sex , ' she declared			2
' this alone causes many to wear a subconscious air of victimisation that is too attractive for an attacker to resist			0
it may sound facile , but simply by walking with confidence you can deter attackers			0
' her passion for the subject came from the beatings she took from her own father			2
his tempers in the family home were fierce , and @entity1 said she was hit while her mother ' stood by '			1
revealing the abuse for the first time when she was in her 50s , @entity1 said : ' i knew what it was like to be frightened			1
i never knew what my father was going to do — slap me , yell at me , criticise me or just ignore me			2
' once , he hit me so hard that i felt sick and dizzy for three days			0
in the end i had to go to a doctor , who told me i was suffering from concussion			0
i was 19 then , and i had to save up enough money to get out of that house , which i did			0
' my father had been abused by his own father , and so the pattern continued			1
' yet her father adored her mother			2
' he would send her roses every month to mark the day they first met , ' @entity1 said			1
she escaped her father 's rages by going to art school , where she got into the music business by designing album sleeves			2
her musical talent was prodigious			0
she wrote songs for @entity290 , @entity291 and @entity292			0
a brilliant pianist , she orchestrated and produced works by @entity295 and @entity296			0
she also became a director of the @entity298 , the organisation that ensures composers receive royalties for their work			0
as for the era 's proclivity for drugs , @entity35 said she remembered ' being in a restaurant in @entity306 where the whole table was taking coke , and i just said ' no thanks ' and passed it on '			0
in 1977 she was runner up in the @entity313 , broadcast from @entity314 , with the song @entity316			0
and two years ago , when the contest was held in @entity318 , she was on the @entity19 jury — delighted to be a judge , and not at all bothered at no longer being a star .			1

@entity1 died at the age of 66 following suspected brain haemorrhage
