by @entity0 she is the wife of a former archbishop and a noted theologian who has written about the role of women in the male - dominated @entity6			1
yet when asked to name her favourite female biblical character , @entity7 drew a blank – and plumped for @entity10 instead			1
her decision to overlook all of the 188 women named in the scriptures is especially ironic given that she was asked the question for a new book about prejudice in the @entity18 establishment			2
‘ i am afraid i have to say my favourite biblical figure is a man and i do n’t have a favourite woman , ’ said the lecturer , who is married to former archbishop of canterbury @entity20			1
woman of god : dr @entity7 and her husband , the former archbishop of canterbury @entity20 , who could n't name an important woman in the @entity30 instead she chose @entity10 , saying : ‘ i just think @entity10 is one of the great maligned and misunderstood figures in the @entity30			1
‘ but i think that he ’s such a complex and interesting person and responsible for so much of how we see theology			0
’ dr @entity7 is one of 12 prominent female @entity36 who were interviewed for @entity37 , a new book by @entity39 , subtitled @entity40			0
mrs @entity39 – daughter - in - law of the @entity42 ’s cousin princess @entity41 – even cites the patriarchal writings of @entity10 as one reason why women ’s progress has been hampered			1
nonetheless , 57 - year - old dr @entity7 – who wrote her own book , @entity48 , about female ordination – praised her hero ’s ‘ complete passion ’ and the fact he ‘ changed his life ’ after his conversion when he had a vision of @entity57 on the road to @entity59			2
the mother of two , a lecturer at @entity62 in @entity63 , added : ‘ he is an intellectual person who ’s going to do such rigorous theology but it was the encounter with @entity57 that took him there			0
’ none of dr @entity7 ’s fellow contributors have had any difficulty naming their heroines , with one even opting for the bleeding woman who touches @entity57 in @entity73 , 40 - 48			2
@entity74 , ( @entity75 ) , by @entity76 dated 1507 - 8			0
the role of women in @entity18 iconography is very well documented by artwork , studies and literature baroness @entity83 , the @entity84 , is one of two contributors to pick @entity86 , the second most important woman in the @entity87 after @entity88			1
although traditionally portrayed as a fallen woman saved from a life of sin by @entity92 , she is now believed to have been a teacher and a leader in her own right			0
rev @entity96 , a vicar in @entity63 , chooses @entity97 , the @entity98 prophet and warrior who inspired troops into battle			0
in her contribution , dr @entity7 is careful not to rock the boat on the role of women in the @entity6			2
she wrote : ‘ i partly agree with the problem of the @entity6 ’s patriarchal image but the other side is that there are quite a lot of women in fairly senior positions in the @entity6			0

wife of @entity20 could n't think of a woman that she liked from the bible
she instead chose @entity10 , calling him ' maligned and misunderstood '
