but ten years on , after living a life which she thought was cancer - free , the single mum - of - five has been told her cancer is now terminal			1
her biggest concern going forward is for her children , whose ages range from 20 to nine years old , and how they will live without her			0
' i worry about how they ’re going to be and who ’s going to look after them , what ’s going to happen , how they ’re going to cope , ' ms @entity0 said			0
after her initial diagnosis , the @entity17 woman learned in october 2013 her cancer had spread to her liver , and she also had a small amount in one of her shoulders			1
' i went to have lap - band surgery and they did a scan of my liver and found some legions which ended up being cancer , little tiny bit in my shoulder too , ' ms @entity0 revealed			2
ms @entity0 has a bucket list of things she wants to do with her children : @entity69 , 20 , @entity28 17 , @entity70 , 14 , @entity30 , 12 , @entity5 , 9 , in the time she has left she was first diagnosed with breast cancer in 2005 , but it has since spread to her liver , shoulder , and brain the 37 - year - old has undergone coutnless chemotherapy and radiation treatments in the past decade instead of the surgery she was supposed to have , she had to endure five months of chemotherapy and hormone treatments , which successfully shrunk the spots in her liver			1
' for most people a bucket list is something that has lots of adventurous things on it ... my bucket list is for me and my kids , so they can enjoy their home environment and that we can make as many happy memories as possible while i can			0
some of the items on the mother - of - five 's list include : then at the beginning of this year , ms @entity0 began having some strange symptoms once again			2
' i 'd been having headaches and just forgetting things , and sometimes i 'd read something and the worlds had been jumbled around			0
' on february 14 i had a seizure and discovered the cancer had gone to my brain , ' she revealed , saying the horrible event happened in front of three of her kids			1
radiation therapy is currently trying to shrink the ten tumors spread throughout her brain , but the cancer is inoperable , and devastatingly , terminal			1
as for how much time ms @entity0 has left with her children , it 's impossible to know			0
' they ca n’t say , ' she said , speaking of her doctors			0
' they 've said a few months to a few years			0
' ms @entity0 has a bucket list of things she hopes to do , see and experience with her family before her time is up , but life is much harder for her than it used to be			0

she has thrown her support behind @entity147 's @entity146 campaign which aims to raise money to fund more breast cancer nurses ms @entity0 , pictured here with eldest daughter @entity69 , is not sure how much time she has left with her kids and perhaps the most important : ' finding someone who will love my kids nearly as much as i do ! '			1
but the medication she currently on makes her more exhausted than ' i 've ever been in my life ' , and leaves her wiped out for days at a time			0
however the mum - of - five said her life would be even more difficult if she did n't have the support of @entity147 , @entity162			1
she has thrown her support behind the @entity163 , which aims to raise money which will go towards funding more breast cancer nurses and support services			1
' i 've rung them crying so many times , ' ms @entity0 revealed			0
' their support is so , so amazing			0
' when a patient first receives their diagnosis and calls the care centre , they are allocated a nurse who helps them through their entire journey			0
the nurses make house calls , ring and check up on them , send counsellors out to get people through tough times and help patients get connected with support groups			2
she hopes to take her family on a holiday together , and get a photoshoot with everyone soon ms @entity0 also hopes to raise awareness about the mortality rates of women with breast cancer ' they help with everything , if you need some financial help , or you need legal help , if you need a lift ... ' ms @entity0 said			2
' ( and ) it ’s good to be able to speak to other people going through the same thing , ' she added , speaking of the help she received through her stage 4 support group			1
through her involvement in this campaign , ms @entity0 also wants to help raise awareness about the mortality rates of women who suffer from breast cancer			2
she has questioned why she is classified as a ' survivor ' because she has lived for more than five years after her diagnosis , but will still eventually succumb to the disease			0
ms @entity0 said she would like to see more research done on @entity219 , or terminal , breast cancer because even though hers was detected early , it will still eventually take her life			1
' so much money goes into awareness for breast cancer , but no money goes into actually researching stage 4 cancer , ' she said , adding that as it 's the one that takes lives there should be more known about it			1
ms @entity0 hopes in the future there can be more awareness about the mortality rates of the disease , and that people know that even if detected early , that breast cancer can still kill			1
' it ’s important for so many people , you know , my kids , people 's families ' , she said			2
