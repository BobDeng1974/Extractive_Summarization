by @entity0 published : 03:41 est , 30 august 2013 updated : 06:22 est , 30 august 2013 as an @entity3 playing at the @entity3 @entity5 tournament , @entity1 found it hard to believe so many @entity8 spectators were cheering so vigorously for his @entity10 opponent , @entity9			1
they clapped rhythmically while chanting : ' @entity12 , @entity9 ! ' they loudly sang his last name between points			1
they rose to their feet and raucously saluted @entity9 's best shots			1
they applauded faults and other miscues by the 13th - seeded @entity1 , the highest - ranked @entity3 man , who eventually pulled out a 7 - 5 , 6 - 2 , 4 - 6 , 7 - 6 ( 4 ) victory last night			1
scroll for highlights of the match miffed : @entity3 @entity1 shows his frustration during his @entity8 match as the spectators get behind his @entity10 opponent @entity9 at @entity28 in @entity29 disheartened : the cheers for @entity9 were an unusual display during a match involving a @entity3 player at the most important tennis tournament in the @entity3 wanting bang for their buck ? the clapped rhythmically while chanting ' @entity12 , @entity9 ! ' late in the third set and even applauded @entity1 's errors ' i was a little bit disappointed in that , actually			1
not going to sugarcoat it , ' said @entity1 , who reached the third round at @entity28 for the fifth consecutive year			1
' if i was playing in @entity10 , it certainly would n't be like that			2
' from late in the third set , spectators at @entity48 really began backing @entity9			2
' it was surprising , actually , ' @entity9 said			2
' it was surprising - but it was good			0
' it certainly was an unusual display during a match involving a @entity3 player at the most important tennis tournament in the @entity3			2
maybe , as @entity9 guessed afterward , the ticket - holders simply wanted more bang for their buck , instead of a three - set , open - and - shut affair			0
or maybe , as @entity1 surmised , @entity9 's style just won them over			1
' he 's a very fun - loving guy and he gets cheered on wherever he goes , not just in @entity10			2
' he 's one of the most exciting tennis players in the world , hands down , ' @entity1 said			2
' he 's been fighting a bunch of injuries , so it 's good to see him back healthy			0
' ' a little disappointed ' : @entity1 , who at number 13 seed is the highest - ranked @entity3 man , believes the crowd were won over by @entity9 's flamboyant style eccentric : @entity9 is most decidedly a showman , one of the most gregarious and demonstrative players on tour , who plays to the crowd and sometimes seems more interested in being an entertainer than a winner talent : @entity9 has been ranked as high as no. 7 , but he also has been slowed by injuries @entity9 is most decidedly a showman , one of the most gregarious and demonstrative players on tour , one who plays to the crowd and sometimes seems more interested in being an entertainer than a winner			1
he 's been ranked as high as no. 7 , and reached the semifinals at his home major , the @entity91 , in 2008			0
but he also has been slowed by injuries , and skipped @entity93 this year			0
@entity9 did not disappoint yesterday , sliding into the splits while chasing some balls , holding his arms wide apart and nodding after one particularly skillful shot , and even pointing out a man in the stands who was chastised by the chair umpire for using a flash while taking photos			0
' he gets the crowd involved , ' @entity1 said			0
' if you purchase a ticket to watch him play , you 're not going to go home disappointed			0
that 's just how it is			0
' the 6ft 10in @entity1 , born in @entity110 and based in @entity111 , is hardly the most well - known or accomplished @entity3 tennis player , but he is probably the host country 's best chance for a deep run this year			1
up against the crowd : despite the cheers for his opponent , @entity1 signals that he is one point from victory mutual respect : @entity1 eventually pulled out a 7 - 5 , 6 - 2 , 4 - 6 , 7 - 6 ( 4 ) victory at the at @entity48 popular : @entity9 responds to the cheers of the crowd as he walks off the court after his defeat especially after the next - highest @entity3 man , 26th - seeded @entity128 , lost earlier thursday to @entity129 of @entity10 7 - 6 ( 4 ) , 7 - 6 ( 5 ) , 6 - 7 ( 5 ) , 6 - 4			1
now @entity1 will face no. 22 @entity130 of @entity131 , the player he lost to in the third round last year			0
' i 'm going to get some revenge on him , ' said @entity1 , whose best showing at any @entity5 tournament was when he was a quarterfinalist at the @entity138			0
what he is most famous for , of course , is winning the longest match in tennis history , an 11 - hour , five - minute marathon that stretched over three days at @entity93 three years ago before ending at 70 - 68 in the fifth set			0
one thing @entity1 does rather well is win tiebreakers , thanks in large part to his booming serve , and that was how this match was decided			2
@entity9 was ahead 4 - 3 in the fourth - set tiebreaker , but @entity1 took the last four points			1
he hit a 135mph service winner , then a 139mph ace - his 23rd of the match - to make it 5 - 4			0
an inside - out forehand winner put @entity1 up 6 - 4 , earning a match point , and he gestured to the fans to show him some love			0
they did , screaming , ' @entity3 ! @entity3 - a ! ' @entity1 - whose right hip was bothering him and was treated by a trainer early in the fourth set - ended it there , hitting a crisp volley that @entity9 got to , but could only put into the net			1
@entity1 chucked his racket and then pantomimed the same sort of ' @entity170 ' - inspired move that @entity172 - the quarterback for @entity1 's favorite @entity174 team , the @entity173 - uses to celebrate touchdowns			1
' i ... knew that against @entity9 , the atmosphere was going to be electric , ' @entity1 said , ' and that 's what it was			1

@entity28 spectators clapped and chanted for @entity9
saluted @entity10 's best shots and even applauded @entity1 's faults
@entity1 : ' i was disappointed . if i was in @entity10 , it would n't be like that '
@entity3 , who is seeded number 13 , went on to win in four sets
