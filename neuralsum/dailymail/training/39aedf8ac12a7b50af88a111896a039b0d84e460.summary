by @entity0 published : 11:28 est , 14 august 2012 updated : 04:52 est , 15 august 2012 all smiles : @entity3 's leader @entity2 appeared jovial when he appeared in public earlier this year , but he has not been seen since march he may not have showed up for the party , but that did not stop the rest of @entity3 celebrating @entity2 's 86th birthday yesterday			1
messages of congratulation were broadcast over the state media and cultural centres organised concerts in honour of the retired leader			1
a special art show in the @entity17 depicted moments in @entity2 's life from childhood to his arrival as one of the most recognized figures in @entity24			1
the @entity25 also joined in with a small party featuring a huge cake and children singing @entity3 's version of the ' @entity31 ' song			2
government - run websites carried essays on his life and best wishes were sent from presidents @entity38 of @entity40 and @entity41 of @entity42			2
but through it all , the ' comandante ' was nowhere to be seen			0
@entity2 , who survived in power for nearly 50 years despite numerous attempts on his life and periodic rumours of his passing , still appears to have a strong hold on people 's affections - even if he is not physically seen for months at a time			1
he had stepped aside temporarily in 2006 , due to an illness that he later said nearly killed him , and in 2008 he left the presidency permanently			0
younger brother @entity53 , who turned 81 earlier this year , took over			0
@entity2 does n't seem to have much of a hand in running the country , though he has publicly voiced approval for @entity53 's programme of economic reforms and the younger @entity2 says he consults with his brother			1
the exact nature of @entity2 's illness was never revealed and the status of his health is kept secret , but media reports said it was complications from diverticulitis , an intestinal ailment common in older people			1
these have often taken on the form of short , sometimes cryptic messages			0
in one of the mysterious mini- ' @entity90 wrote about something called the ' fc ' without explicitly saying what they were			0
others marvelled at yoga masters ' flexibility , extolled the nutritive virtues of a tree known as moringa and reproduced six lines of poetry about @entity103			0
in their hearts : children sang happy birthday to the famed revolutionary , while a man hangs a picture of @entity2 but he has not published a column since june and @entity2 last appeared in photos and video in march			1
at that time , @entity2 looked jovial , but thin and pale as he and companion @entity113 greeted a visiting pope @entity114			2
as @entity2 passes yet another milestone , he is perhaps becoming increasingly aware of his own mortality			2
he seemed to hint at this in a letter to his friend and ally @entity120 in july , when the @entity122 president turned 58			0
' fifty - eight years is nothing , @entity124 , ' @entity2 wrote in the letter , which was posted online by @entity122 's office of the presidency and reproduced by @entity3 website @entity127			1
' i , who am almost 28 years older , have lived a great part of the last 100 years and can testify as to the meaning of time			0
' important figure : despite not being seen in public for a while , @entity2 is still a large figure in people 's lives without the public appearances and fewer published columns , rumours have inevitably begun to swirl over where @entity2 is - and how he is			1
' has @entity3 converted @entity2 into a virtual figure ? ' opposition blogger @entity143 tweeted			2
' he does n't appear , but they tell us he 's still alive			0
' but it also seems that people do not have to see the famed revolutionary with their own eyes to keep believing in him			0
' just his being there , alive , gives people a lot of strength to keep working and fighting , ' said @entity156 , a 53 - year - old self - employed cab driver in @entity75			0
in recognition of his birthday , @entity158 newspaper @entity157 also published memories of @entity2 from people familiar with him , such as @entity3 journalists and cohorts from the 1959 revolution , which relate the awe with which people still hold him			1
' every time i meet with @entity2 i feel like i have had to stand up and defend him against whatever they might want to do to him , ' famed @entity3 ballerina @entity172 was quoted as saying in @entity157 's collection of memories			1
' every time i meet with him i feel nervous			0
' in the frame : children take a picture in front of a mural of @entity2 , who still has a strong hold over the people of @entity3 outspoken : @entity2 regularly wrote a column , ' reflections ' , which are lengthy essays on politics , but he has not published one since june video : happy birthday ! @entity3 wish their leader has many more happy days ahead ! ...			2

' @entity193 ' nowhere to be seen as state media broadcast messages of congratulation and leaders send birthday wishes
concerts , art shows and @entity201 celebrate @entity2 's birthday
