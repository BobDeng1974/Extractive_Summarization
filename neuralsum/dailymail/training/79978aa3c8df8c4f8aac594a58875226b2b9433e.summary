by @entity0 published : 20:55 est , 8 march 2013 updated : 06:08 est , 9 march 2013 @entity1 walking for @entity2 at the @entity3 show during @entity5 fashion week nothing was said at the time — this is , after all the world of fashion , and @entity1 expects to be sucked up to at every opportunity			1
but , at the cocktail party of @entity13 , former editor of @entity14 , in the @entity15 in @entity16 on tuesday night , some were taken aback when miss @entity1 turned up in a tiny bodysuit , sprinkled with diamante stones that was completely sheer			1
the look bore little relation to the event ’s prescribed ‘ smokey eye and black tie ’ dress code — instead it was the sort of look - at - me number you might expect to see on an ageing pop star such as @entity27			1
and from the back , the famous @entity1 derriere — which rather hung out of the back of her shorts — looked deflated , crinkled and every one of its 39 years			2
it was not what we ’d expect from the fashion icon , who has been working as a model for 25 years			1
a rare style misstep , or a sign that @entity1 , desperate to keep up with models half her age , is losing her gloss ? fashion critics derided her choice of outfit , while online commentators were cruel about the model ’s figure , remarking on her ‘ short			1
pony legs ’ and ‘ rough ’ appearance			1
‘ @entity1 is well known for her could n’t - care-less meets attention - seeking attitude , but this all - over ten - denier style statement spelled nothing but desperation , ’ said @entity52 , the fashion editor of the website @entity54			1
all this comes at a time when 20 - year - old @entity62 has exploded onto the fashion scene with her onesie - wearing , face - pulling quirkiness			1
@entity62 has everything that @entity1 used to have , and is clearly getting all of the attention that goes with it			1
who could blame @entity1 if she did feel a tad rattled by a new arrival threatening her crown when she ’s not yet ready to surrender it ? the fact is that miss @entity62 , a private schoolgirl from @entity74 , is very much on the up , having just posed for her first @entity14 cover			1
and while @entity62 was mobbed by excitable fashion students and fans outside the fashion shows all week in @entity16 , @entity1 glumly and quietly glided from the @entity80 hotel to her car and on to the shows with much less fuss and attention			1
@entity62 walked in seven shows including @entity86 , @entity87 , @entity88 and @entity89 and was the undisputed hit of the week — indeed , she ’s racked up an astonishing 25 shows this year			1
fresh face : @entity62 has exploded onto the fashion scene and just posed for her first @entity14 cover @entity1 , meanwhile , only walked for her old friend @entity2 at @entity3 ( alongside @entity62 ) where she closed the show			1
indeed , it must surely grate that one of the most high - profile advertising contracts which @entity1 once fronted — posing for @entity99 — has gone to @entity62			1
on close inspection , @entity1 appears to be exerting less of a draw over the fashion world			1
while she remains the @entity105 ’s highest earning model by some way , it ’s said that her annual earnings have dropped by at least £ 3 million and continue to spiral downwards			2
the most recent estimate in june last year by @entity109 , the @entity110 business magazine , said that she had earned £ 6.3 million in the previous 12 months , compared with a 2010/11 figure of £ 8.9 million			2
on top of this apparent dip in income @entity1 has , in recent months , also seen the lucrative contracts she once held go to younger models , including the glamorous @entity119 campaign she fronted from 2011 to 2012			2
rising @entity121 star @entity120 — who looks like an impossibly fresh @entity122 — now fronts the @entity124 campaign that rolled out in june last year			2
she was also replaced as the ‘ face ’ of the @entity127 clothing chain @entity126 in december after a three - year association			2
@entity130 supermodel @entity129 , 29 , fronted @entity126 ’s most recent campaign instead of her			2
@entity1 ’s perfume campaign for @entity89 ’s @entity133 ended in 2011			2
the scent is now being represented by @entity135 , a 22 - year - old @entity137 actress and model			1
her campaign for the lingerie firm @entity140 has also run its course , with the firm using young @entity105 model @entity143 , who was then succeeded by @entity144			2
now actress @entity146 and her sister @entity148 front the brand			2
on the up : @entity62 starred at @entity151 likewise , her @entity153 adverts are a distant memory — the brand is now represented by @entity157 actress @entity156			1
adverts for @entity160 jeans , which @entity1 did in 2005 , currently feature @entity163 model @entity161 , who is a younger , blonder , leggier @entity1 doppelganger			2
of course , this is the nature of the fast - moving fashion and beauty industry , as brands seek to associate themselves with the biggest name of the moment			1
and that ’s not to say that @entity1 is n’t working any more , and many in the fashion world are very loyal to her			1
she has a campaign for @entity176 , thanks to her friendship with creative director @entity179 , and also another for @entity181 this year ( the fashion house has a decades - long relationship with her )			1
when approached by the @entity185 , her agency storm was quick to point out her five magazine covers so far this year and the fact her £ 50 coffee table book , of which more later , has been a sell out			0
it must be said that the shoots and campaigns she is doing are , quite frankly , bordering on sleazy			0
her current campaign for @entity194 — shot by @entity195 — is a crude photograph of @entity1 in a short skirt looking as if she is straddling a pole			0
yet again , another picture in the same flesh - exposing , attention - seeking league			0
she starred in a wearyingly ‘ provocative ’ cover shoot for the february issue of @entity203 , which featured her striking quasi-lesbian poses with the singer @entity205			0
she is even said to be in talks to pose as a cover girl for @entity209 ’s 60th anniversary edition			0
but while her shoots are becoming increasingly gratuitous , @entity1 ’s taste for fast living seems to have waned with age			0
she has settled into a slightly suburban version of her old @entity216 life in a £ 8.5 million home in @entity218 , @entity216 , with her rocker husband @entity219 and daughter @entity220 , 11 , whose father is style commentator and publisher @entity222			0
the hedonistic days when she was a leading light of the @entity225 posse are a distant memory			0
the excesses of her on - and - off romance with heroin addict @entity229 are also far behind her			0
now she likes to spend her time walking her @entity233 terrier @entity231 and popping to her local pub , @entity234 in @entity218			0
perhaps in an attempt to cling on to her career , she has started taking care of herself more			0
her new home has a @entity240 steam room in the basement and she is a fan of expensive facial treatments			0
there have even been reports of her trying @entity245 , although @entity1 , naturally blessed with a slim physique , has never had much patience with exercise			0
meanwhile , perhaps aware that her moment has passed , @entity1 seems to be trying to reinvent herself as an icon of fashion history			1
in november last year , she brought out a coffee table book titled simply @entity1 — a ‘ diary in pictures ’ of her modelling career			0
it is a thick tome costing an eye - watering £ 50			0
she says nothing about drugs , about her @entity225 years , or about @entity229			0
to the untutored eye , however , the book looks more soft porn than high fashion and seems another thinly - disguised attempt to hold onto the number one supermodel slot			1
she is naked in around half the pictures : naked on a beach , naked on a rug , naked except for a spiked helmet and so on			0
@entity1 told one interviewer that her daughter opened the book and exclaimed : ‘ @entity274 ! ’ in dismay			0
she says she has promised @entity220 there will be fewer revealing shots in any subsequent volumes			0
what an excruciating conversation to have with an 11 - year - old			0
but then , as she proved in @entity16 this week , there are only so many surefire ways to get everybody ’s attention			0
and even though she is growing older , she has n’t quite grown out of them just yet .			0
