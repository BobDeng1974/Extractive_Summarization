by @entity1 reporter published : 11:47 est , 4 october 2013 updated : 13:50 est , 4 october 2013 mentally ill : @entity2 admitted she drowned the children in the bathtub of her apartment in @entity6 , on @entity7 about 20 miles east of @entity8 , in february 2008 a mentally disturbed woman who drowned her three young children in a bathtub is going to court to ask a judge for a cut of their $ 350,000 estate			1
@entity2 will be taken from an upstate psychiatric facility to testify about her request next month , @entity17 judge @entity16 ruled thursday			0
@entity20 , 33 , was found not guilty because of mental disease or defect in the deaths of her children , @entity26 , six , @entity27 , five , and @entity28 , one , so her attorneys say she should n't be subject to laws that bar convicts from profiting from their crimes			1
@entity20 admitted she drowned the children in the bathtub of her apartment in @entity6 , on @entity7 about 20 miles east of @entity8 , in february 2008			1
she later placed the children 's bodies on a bed and tried to kill herself by swallowing a concoction of household cleaning chemicals			1
when that suicide bid failed , she jumped out her second - story window but again survived			0
instead of facing trial on three murder counts in the children 's deaths , @entity20 pleaded not responsible by reason of mental disease or defect			2
psychiatrists had determined she suffered a major depressive disorder and believed she killed the children to save them from the potentially fatal effects of voodoo			0
@entity20 is being kept at a state psychiatric hospital until psychiatrists determine she 's no longer mentally ill. although the case would establish a precedent in @entity8 if @entity20 succeeds , she 's not expected to see any money because of a $ 1.2 million lien against her for psychiatric counseling and other services she has received since her arrest , attorneys said			1
@entity8 's @entity63 , named for the 1970s serial killer and amended in 2001 , was designed to prevent criminals from profiting from their crimes , such as by selling their stories to book publishers or moviemakers			2
the judge in @entity20 's case , though , has noted the unique aspect â€” that @entity20 was n't convicted			0
happy children : @entity20 drowned @entity74 ( left ) , six , and @entity75 ( right ) , five , as well as their one - year - old brother innocent ( not pictured ) the case drew attention to @entity17 's social services agency , whose caseworkers visited @entity20 's apartment two days before the killings and found no one home but neglected to schedule an immediate follow - up visit			1
two social workers were later suspended			0
lawsuits against the county filed by the father of @entity20 's 1 - year - old son , @entity92 , and 5 - year - old son , @entity75 , were settled for $ 250,000			2
a lawsuit filed by the father of @entity20 's 6 - year - old daughter , @entity74 , was recently settled for $ 100,000 .			0

@entity2 drowned children , aged 1 , 5 and 6 , at home on @entity7
she then tried to kill herself by *drinking* household cleaning chemicals
judges found her not guilty over the 2008 killings because of mental illness
so she 's not subject to law barring convicts from profiting from their crimes
she is unlikely to see the money though *due* to a $ 1.2m lien for counseling
