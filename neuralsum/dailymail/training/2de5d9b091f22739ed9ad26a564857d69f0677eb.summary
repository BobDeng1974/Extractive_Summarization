a @entity1 farmer turned the snow that was ruining his greenhouses this winter into a spectacular 50 - foot snowman that is now attracting national media attention and visitors from miles around			1
@entity7 knew he had to clean up the nuisance snow , but he also thought it would be a great way to perk up his @entity12 community deep in the winter doldrums			1
hundreds of hours and about five weeks later , people began flocking to @entity7 's farm as news of his impressive creation filled up newsfeeds , inboxes and social media across the web			1
though anyone could debate the usefulness of a 50 - foot snowman , the longtime farmer at least took to building the sculpture in a practical way			1
friends and family pitched in to help with @entity27 , or to do farm chores while @entity7 worked on building the snowman using a skid loaders to pile snow and a silage blower to direct snow into stacked cylinders , the @entity44 reported			1
after the arduous but enjoyable labor of love , @entity27 clocked in at an impressive 50 feet and people immediately took notice			0
@entity58 and @entity59 were among the amused onlookers this past sunday			0

@entity7 took a break from the @entity1 snow with a vacation to @entity77 , where he said he 's even been contacted by the @entity78 and the @entity79			1
@entity7 told the @entity44 that he 's looking forward to flipping through the guestbook when he returns home to see how far people have come to gawk at @entity27			1
heavy duty : @entity7 had help from friends and family			2
they used heavy machinery including this loader and even a silo conveyer belt to move the snow into giant plastic ring forms larger than life : since a carrot just would n't do , @entity7 used a trash barrel for a nose for @entity7 , that was the whole point of creating @entity27			1
' it puts a smile on people 's faces , ' @entity7 said			2
' when people smile , you know you 've done a good thing			0
' granddaddy is but a mere child compared to efforts in the small community of @entity109 , @entity110 , in 2008			0
