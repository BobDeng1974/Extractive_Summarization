a spokesman for the hospital said : we apologize sincerely			0
we have done our best to find many remedies to help those affected move forward			0

she has now sued the hospital for wrongful discharge , defamation , slander , and libel and seeks damages exceeding $ 25,000.this kind of accident is unheard of in organ transplant centers and it was a good decision not to use the kidney , dr @entity200 , director of kidney transplantation at @entity202 , told the @entity131			2
disastrous error : an investigation is underway at the @entity22 after a nurse accidentally disposed of a kidney a man donated for his sick sister humans do not need two kidneys to live , the body can support life with only one			1
if one functional kidney is missing from birth , the other kidney can grow to reach a size similar to the combined weight of two kidneys ' this is unfortunately what medicine is like - it is not perfect , and there have been far worse cases where the donor has died , ' @entity200 said			2
there were 16,816 kidney transplants nationwide last year from live donors and from those who consented to organ donation through state registries should they die from an illness or accident , the newspaper reported			0
