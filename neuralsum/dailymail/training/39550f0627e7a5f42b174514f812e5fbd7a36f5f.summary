by @entity0 and @entity1 @entity4 for @entity5 will undermine the @entity6 and cost the @entity7 billions of pounds , @entity3 ’s military grandees warned yesterday			1
in an unprecedented alliance , 12 of the country ’s most senior defence and intelligence veterans have written to @entity12 condemning plans to scrap @entity14 if there is a ‘ yes ’ vote in september			1
the first minister ’s controversial proposals would put the @entity3 ’s nuclear deterrent ‘ in jeopardy ’ and cast a ‘ dark shadow ’ over international relations , they said			1
deterrent : trident submarine @entity25 off @entity5 the @entity7 would be forced to shift the submarine - based deterrent from @entity5 , incurring huge costs which would inevitably eat into the defence budget and hit the @entity6			1
it would also potentially scupper @entity33 hopes of joining @entity34 , according to the former heads of the @entity36 , @entity6 and the @entity37			0
fellow nuclear powers @entity38 and @entity39 , in particular , would be ‘ concerned ’ by the ‘ unacceptable ’ development because the military alliance has @entity3 - based nuclear weapons as a cornerstone of its protection			1
the former defence chiefs also warned that forcing the removal of the @entity14 nuclear missile system from its base at @entity50 on the @entity51 would cost ‘ many , if not most ’ of the 7,000 @entity5 jobs there			1
the letter is the most significant intervention yet amid an ongoing row over the @entity33 ’s defence strategy for a separate @entity5			2
mr @entity12 has drawn up plans for a £ 2.5billion annual budget for defence and security			1
that compares with £ 35billion for defence alone spent each year across the @entity3			0
nationalists claim they can spend less because @entity14 missiles would be removed from @entity50 by the end of the decade , although the @entity33 recently backed @entity34 membership – and still wants the protection of its first - strike nuclear capacity			2
last year , @entity34 chiefs privately agreed that it may be possible to fast - track membership for an independent @entity5 , but – crucially – only if there are no unresolved disputes with other countries , such as the rest of the @entity3			2
the letter to mr @entity12 has been written by admiral sir @entity78 , @entity79 and chief of naval staff between 2009 and 2013			2
it is also signed by four former chiefs of the defence staff , four other first sea lords and chiefs of naval staff , a former chief of the air staff , the former chief of the general staff who commanded the @entity3 forces in @entity90 , general sir @entity91 , and @entity3 ’s most senior intelligence civil servant after the 9/11 terror attacks , sir @entity92			0
intelligence veterans have written to first minister @entity12 to condemn plans to scrap @entity14 sir @entity78 writes : ‘ for the continuing @entity3 such a demand [ to remove @entity14 ] , not least in the timescale envisaged , would cause huge practical problems and upheaval for the @entity6 and require massive additional expenditure – running into many billions of pounds – and would be deeply resented by many			1
‘ the negotiations with @entity106 following a @entity108 vote , covering such vital matters as currency , financial settlements and re-allocating existing @entity3 defence and other assets , can be expected to be complex and difficult			0
if the very future of the @entity3 nuclear deterrent was also in the balance , it would inevitably sour those negotiations			0
’ sir @entity78 ’s letter warns of concerns if @entity5 ‘ pushed a unilateral nuclear disarmament agenda ’			0
he says : ‘ @entity34 could hardly be expected to welcome a new member state whose government put in jeopardy the continued operation of the @entity3 independent nuclear deterrent – a deterrent which protects not only the @entity3 but all of @entity34 as well			0
’ he also criticises the @entity5 government ’s @entity129 on independence			0
‘ [ @entity34 ] would view with alarm the suggestion of a constitutional ban on nuclear weapons in @entity5 , ’ he writes			0
sir @entity78 adds that ‘ the very prospect of implementing the @entity5 government ’s policy would cast a dark shadow over the international reception given to a newly independent @entity5 nation ’			1
@entity14 missiles are carried on four @entity25 nuclear - powered submarines			2
the @entity3 government is committed to maintaining and renewing the submarine patrols			0
a @entity5 government spokesman said : ‘ the estimated £ 170million that @entity5 taxpayers contribute every year to the maintenance and running of @entity14 could be far better spent by prioritising our conventional defence needs			1
