former @entity1 and @entity2 flanker @entity0 has called on the @entity4 organisers to change the way they draw up the @entity7 after @entity8 was left out of 12 - man nominations			1
@entity8 , 26 , was one of his country 's best players throughout the competition but the @entity1 skipper is not up for the top gong , which is based upon performance statistics rather than balanced expert opinions			1
@entity17 and @entity18 are the only @entity20 nominations while @entity21 , who lost every game , also have two players in the running in @entity26 and @entity27			1
@entity1 skipper @entity8 races away for a try during his side 's 60 - 21 trouncing of @entity32 in @entity33 ' @entity8 is the standout name not on that list , ' @entity0 told @entity36			1
' it was a big surprise			2
it 's always very contentious , but it 's picked using statistics and i do n't think that 's the way to do it			2
i prefer the way they do it for @entity45 where they use a panel of experts to get a general consensus			0
@entity8 can feel very hard done by for not making it			1
you could make a case for @entity52 and @entity53 as well			0
' @entity55 stats are always very high but penalties can count against you if you play on the edge			0
his influence on the team ca n't be measured through stats because they do n't capture those big moments in a game where the big players stand up			0
' @entity8 will be the player to win a big turnover to win a big game ; but that just counts as one turnover on a stat sheet			1
he 's a fantastic role model and a leader by actions			0
' wales fly half @entity17 has made the @entity4 shortlist for @entity76 wales lock @entity18 is the only other @entity20 player to make the 12 - man shortlist after losing their opening test against @entity80 , @entity1 went on to win all of their remaining fixtures and eventually finished third on points difference			1
@entity83 expects his side to be serious challengers at the @entity86 and , if they can continue to build on their momentum , @entity0 believes they have the talent to make the final at @entity90			2
' this squad has more or less been together for four years , so they 're in a really good place , ' said @entity0			2
' they will obviously be disappointed not to win the tournament but , in terms of the bigger picture , they 're looking good for the @entity86			0
can they be challengers ? yes , why not ? the group stages are just as difficult as the quarter and semi finals			0
that 's how finely balanced it is			2
if they win the group , then they could go all the way			0
then again , they might not get out of their group at all			0
