on sale for $ 218 , the televisions were part of the @entity20 store 's @entity18 on @entity21			1
several people got heated as the number of @entity15 began to dwindle , said police			2
witnesses said people tried to claim the items by lying on top of them and wrestling each other off			1
it got so rough that police had to jump in to sort things out			1
@entity20 police said law enforcement in the video were off - duty police and sheriff 's deputies hired to provide extra security for @entity8			1
in the end , no was hurt and no one was arrested			0

cell phone footage of the brawl has gone viral after it was posted on @entity12 and shows authorities having to forcibly remove shoppers who were lying on top of the giant 50 inch tvs ' it does n't surprise me			1
the way people are acting to save money and you ca n't blame them			2
they are just trying to save some money , ' shopper @entity67 told @entity69			0
early discounting , more online shopping and a mixed economy meant fewer people shopped over @entity21 weekend , the @entity70 said on sunday			1
overall , 133.7 million people shopped in stores and online over the four - day weekend , down 5.2 percent from last year , according to a survey of 4,631 people conducted by @entity79 for the trade group			2
total spending for the weekend is expected to fall 11 percent to $ 50.9 billion from an estimated $ 57.4 billion last year , the trade group estimated			0
part of the reason is that @entity85 , @entity86 , @entity87 , @entity8 and other major retailers pushed fat discounts as early as @entity90			0
some opened stores even earlier on @entity21			2
all that stole some thunder from @entity3 and the rest of the weekend			0
crazy : discount store shoppers were prepared to wait in long lines on @entity3 - but the decision of many retailers to open on @entity21 has affected the sales figures for the busiest shopping day of the year still , the preliminary data makes retailers worried that shoppers remain frugal despite improving employment and falling gas prices			1
@entity108 , the trade group 's ceo , said he thinks people benefiting from the recovery may not feel the need to fight crowds to get the deepest discount on a tv or toaster			2
and those who feel like the recession never ended may not have the money and will stretch out what they spend through @entity54			2
and shoppers are still feeling the effects of high food prices and stagnant wages			0
' while they 're more optimistic , they 're very cautious , ' @entity108 said			0
' if the deals are not right for them , they 're not going to spend			0
' bottom line : expect more deep discounts , all season long			0
' every day will be @entity3			0
every minute will be cyber monday , ' he said .			0
