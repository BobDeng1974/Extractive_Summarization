' @entity10 prime minister @entity68 ( right ) with his @entity5 counterpart @entity69			1
mr @entity68 told the @entity5 government that the situation at @entity12 's border was ' not acceptable ' the sovereignty of @entity12 is a major source of tension between the @entity10 and @entity5			1
both in 1967 and 2002 , the people of @entity12 rejected proposals for @entity5 sovereignty			1

earlier this month , the @entity5 ambassador was summoned to the @entity13 over what was said to be an unauthorised incursion into @entity127 waters by a @entity5 survey vessel			2
it was the third time the @entity5 ambassador had been publicly summoned over the @entity12 issue since the current @entity5 government took office in december 2011			2
the @entity133 , @entity134 , said on monday that @entity5 would take the @entity10 to the @entity135 if the @entity136 failed to take action over the reef works			2
