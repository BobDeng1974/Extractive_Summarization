when she was robbed of £ 10,000 worth of jewels , @entity0 was left traumatised			1
but in an extraordinary act of forgiveness the 75 - year - old victim has sent one of the burglars £ 20 to help him turn his life around			1
the generous act came after career criminal @entity9 wrote her a letter apologising for his crime			1
@entity0 said she hoped that by giving the burglar the money , it would help ' bring him to his senses ' apology : @entity9 ( left ) wrote a letter to mrs @entity0 while he was awaiting sentencing for the burglary , which took place in august last year the pensioner wrote back to the 24 - year - old , accepting his apology – and enclosed a £ 20 postal order			1
she explained : ‘ he just said he was very , very sorry			0
‘ his writing was appalling [ with ] really bad spelling			2
he said he was really sorry for what had happened and he had been under the influence of valium			0
’ she continued : ‘ i felt sorry for him			2
he obviously was n’t very bright			0
i answered his letter and said thank you for your letter and that i hoped he understood the trauma he ’d caused me			2
’ it appears @entity40 ’s partner in crime had also realised the trouble the pair had caused by their actions			1
during the raid on mrs @entity0 ’s home last august @entity40 and @entity45 , also 24 , grabbed £ 10,000 worth of gems including several rings and watches			1
but after @entity52 pictures of them committing the burglary where broadcast , @entity45 bundled some of the stolen property into a black bin bag and left it outside mrs @entity0 ’s home			1
the release of the @entity52 pictures led to their arrest			0
@entity45 has also written to mrs @entity0 – but has so far not had a response			1
speaking about her letter to @entity40 , mrs @entity0 said : ‘ i made it very short and sweet , thanking him for the letter and said i was sure that he had not only upset me			1
he must have upset his partner or wife both financially and emotionally			0
‘ i thought at first i ’d send him some stamps so he could send letters to loved ones – but i sent him £ 20			2
’ after he was arrested for burgling mrs @entity0 ’s home , a repentant @entity40 wrote to his victim			1
here is his letter ( with spelling mistakes corrected ) to the victims of my really horrible crime that i ’ve committed , i just want to say that i ’m really sorry for my stupid actions			0
i can assure you that i ’m not a bad person , and i do not do things like this			0
i feel really bad , and i know i should			0
things like this should n’t happen at all , and i did n’t even know what i was doing at the time			0
it was only when i went on @entity92 and read all the horrible messages about me that it clicked what i had done			0
after the 75 - year - old replied , sending him £ 20 , he wrote back : @entity98 and mrs @entity0 , i just wanted to say thank you ever so much for your kindness towards me and replying to my letter			1
i really ca n’t say how much that letter meant to me in words , but i can assure you that it made me feel a lot better			0
thank you so much for taking your spare time out of your way to write back to me			0
and if there ’s anything i can do for you when i am released , i will not hesitate to do unpaid work and also , when i ’m released , i will drop you a bunch of flowers and a bottle of good wine			0
i am so sorry for my silly actions			0
her gift came despite @entity40 and his accomplice leaving mrs @entity0 with a £ 500 bill to repair the broken window at her home in @entity123 and several stolen items not being returned			1
mrs @entity0 added : ‘ if people think i ’m silly then hey ho			1
’ ‘ i thought his letter came from the heart but maybe i ’m just gullible			0
i ’m hoping it will bring him to his senses and make him realise he has to go out and work			0
’ she added : ‘ he did say when he comes out of prison he is going to buy me a bunch of flowers and the best bottle of wine he can afford			2
’ details of @entity40 ’s written apology emerged at court , where the two men were jailed for 32 months each after admitting burglary			2
in @entity40 ’s lawyer @entity144 said his client was ‘ remorseful ’ and said of mrs @entity0 ’s gift : ‘ it was out of remarkable sympathy , and i might say , in an almost saintly way , a token of her generosity			1
’ @entity153 : details of the apology emerged at @entity40 ( pictured ) where @entity40 's lawyer used it to help with his plea for mitigation			2
mrs @entity0 said that she thought the letter ' came from the heart '			1
