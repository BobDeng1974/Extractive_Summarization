a coroner has dismissed smoke from a firework display as being the cause of one of @entity6 ’s worst motorway pile - ups - but admitted it may have been a contributing factor to poor visibility			1
seven people died and 51 were injured during the horrific crash involving 34 vehicles on the @entity12 near @entity13 , @entity14 , on november 4 , 2011			1
the collision happened at 8.20pm , just five minutes after a £ 3,000 fireworks display concluded only 200ft away at @entity17			1
seven people died and 51 were injured during the horrific crash involving 34 vehicles on the @entity12 near @entity13 , @entity14 , on november 4 2011 @entity6 's worst motorway pile up : @entity14 coroner @entity19 said smoke from a nearby firework display did not cause the crash - but it may have added to the poor visibility caused by fog in the aftermath of the collision , motorists described driving conditions as like ‘ entering a wall of thick fog ’ with some likening it to having a tin of paint thrown over their windscreens			1
others said thick smog came over their vehicles like a ‘ white curtain ’ , ‘ emulsion ’ or ‘ custard being poured from a jug ’			0
other drivers have described smelling smoke or gunpowder on the motorway			0
grandparents @entity48 , 73 , and his wife @entity49 , 70 , from @entity50 , @entity51 ; @entity53 , 67 , and his daughter @entity54 , 30 , from @entity55 , @entity56 ; battle re-enactor @entity57 , 46 , from @entity58 , @entity14 ; and lorry drivers @entity60 , 55 , from @entity61 , and @entity62 , 38 , from @entity63 , all died in the crash			1
a further 51 others were injured			2
last year firework contractor @entity66 , 51 , who had been operating the display at the rugby club , was cleared at @entity70 of breaching health and safety laws on the night of the crash			1
@entity14 coroner @entity19 told the inquest today : ‘ i dismiss the possible cause being the smoke from the firework display itself			1
’ fireworks contractor @entity66 , 51 , left , was cleared of breaching health and safety laws in relation to the firework display held on the night of the crash but he then added that he could not rule out the possibility that the smoke had mixed with thick fog and maybe further reduced motorists ’ visibility			1
he said : ' there were in the @entity13 area pockets of very dense fog - in some cases of such density that only occur possibly once or maybe twice in a decade			0
' varying plumes of smoke from the firework display - particularly that caught below the inversion area - may have mixed with the fog and therefore i can not rule out the possibility that they drifted under the inversion to the motorway and may have added to the intensity of the obscuration			1
' mr @entity19 said he was considering using his powers to make recommendations to ensure crashes like this did not happen again			0
the coroner said he would consider whether firework operators need to be trained in the problems of running displays during fog , whether there should be a minimum distance from major roads for holding public displays , whether public displays should be licensed and whether fog detection devices should be installed on the @entity12 in the @entity13 area			1
coroner @entity122 's comments were welcomed by the relatives of those killed in the crash			1
speaking after the hearing , @entity126 , the daughter of @entity19 and mrs @entity127 , said she was pleased with mr @entity19 ’s conclusions			0
' i think the coroner ’s recommendations are a big step forward , ' she said			0
' that ’s we were looking for - moving on and making sure this does n’t happen to anybody else			0
' we want to see the licensing of firework displays , the literature changed to include the visibility problems that have arisen			2
' i think the coroner has gone as far as he could go and i think we have had our questions answered			0
' as the coroner said he can not rule out the fact the smoke did n’t play a part and that ’s quite important to us			2
the coroner has summed it all up for us in a lot of ways			0
' her sister @entity127 added : ' i think the outcome today has been very , very positive and from my point of view i would like to see more legislation around fireworks , more so around operators and the way they are allowed to go and set up businesses			1
' they certainly need more training and they need people who are accountable			0
i would n’t say i am 100 % confident it will happen but i certainly hope that is the way it will go			0
' in the aftermath of the collision , motorists described driving conditions as like ' entering a wall of thick fog ' with some likening it to having a tin of paint thrown over their windscreens scene : an inquest heard how there was very dense fog in the @entity13 area at the time of the crash during the inquest , mr @entity19 concluded that all of the victims died on the @entity12 , except for @entity193 who died later in hospital			1
he said : ‘ all the deceased were travelling in motor vehicles on the northbound carriageway when the vehicles entered an area of reduced visibility and collisions occurred as the drivers became disorientated			2
‘ there were in the @entity13 area pockets of very dense fog - in some cases of such density that only occur possibly once or maybe twice in a decade			0
‘ at the time of the accident the pockets were generally small , save for areas running alongside water courses such as the @entity212 , and at 8pm there was an area of dense fog running along a line approximately following the main @entity70 to @entity13 railway line starting about quarter of a mile east of @entity13 station			0
‘ part of this area of fog may have extended to the perimeters of @entity17 and , in all probability , to a height of 25ft or more to reach the motorway			0
' this incident has been described as one of the worst motorway accidents that have occurred in @entity6 and in the town of @entity13 the third most serious in the last 100 years			2
' grandparents @entity48 , 73 and his wife @entity49 , 70 , from @entity50 , @entity51 , both died in the crash			2
their daughters welcomed the coroners comments during the inquest @entity57 ( left ) and @entity236 lorry driver @entity60 ( right ) who were killed in the crash on the @entity12 during the eight - day hearing , mr @entity66 said he did not consider smoke to be a danger to motorists and insisted it did not drift on to the @entity12 from his display			1
the lorry driver said the build - up of smoke during the display did not give him any concern and there was ‘ no reason whatsoever ’ to consider smoke as a potential hazard			1
‘ it is not something anybody has been trained in before or told to look for , ’ he said			0
‘ there has never been any mention of it ( in literature or training courses )			0
’ but some of the people at the display described seeing a ‘ wall ’ of smoke drift across the pitch towards spectators			1
others said they thought the display was too large and in the wrong place because of its proximity to the motorway			0
the inquest also heard that a risk assessment mr @entity66 prepared was lost by one of the rugby club ’s management committee			1
mr @entity66 , an experienced operator , agreed with the question that if there was a fault that night , it was with the rules , regulations and guidance			0
the inquest heard evidence from expert witnesses that none of the published material about firework safety warned of the dangers of smoke to road safety			1
tributes : flowers left on a bridge over the top of the north bound @entity12 near @entity13 after seven people were killed in the @entity12 pile up a coroner has dismissed smoke from a firework display at @entity17 as being the cause of the horrific @entity12 crash @entity66 , 51 , pictured arriving at @entity70 , where he was cleared last year of any wrongdoing in relation to the @entity12 crash fireworks operator @entity66 , 51 , was cleared of breaching health and safety laws on the night of the @entity12 crash			1
during the trial at @entity70 last year , a judge directed a jury to find mr @entity66 not guilty of a single charge of failing to ensure the safety of others contrary to the @entity315			2
mr @entity66 , who ran @entity316 , was the contractor hired by @entity17 to run the £ 3,000 display at its ground , which was watched by 1,000 people			1
he set off 1,500 shots as part of his @entity323 in 15 minutes - just 200 yards from the motorway			2
in a leaflet promoting his business , the experienced mr @entity66 described the display as the ' biggest and most lavish ' piece of ' unforgettable ' pyrotechnics he offered			0
nearly a year after the horrific crash – which is one of the worst motorway pile - ups in @entity6 ’s history – mr @entity66 of @entity333 , @entity14 , was charged with seven counts of manslaughter			1
however , the charges were later dropped and instead he faced the health and safety charge			2
in december last year , mr @entity66 was cleared of any wrongdoing after a judge said the case ' weighted heavily on hindsight '			2
judge @entity342 , who directed the jury at @entity70 to return a verdict of not guilty , said : ' the prosecution case required mr @entity66 to appreciate and react more or less instantly to something not thought to be a hazard to anyone and had no previous reason to think it was a hazard			0
' he added : ' there was no proper basis that you could have concluded that a reasonable person would have appreciated a reasonable risk and reacted to it to stop the display			0
' mr @entity66 , who issued a statement outside court after being cleared , said he believed the decision to prosecute him was ' motivated by a desire to find someone to blame for this terrible accident , simply for the sake of doing so ' .			0
