its quaint cottages , picturesque gardens and towering church spire have earned @entity4 the title of ‘ queen of the @entity7 ’			1
so it ’s perhaps of little surprise that residents of the quiet village reacted with fury when a racy lingerie shop opened on their high street			1
but in an unusual twist to the tale , it was revealed that the risqué boutique of underwear was part of the set for @entity22 , one of the @entity25 ’s most anticipated dramas of 2015			1
outraged residents in @entity4 , in the @entity7 complained about the sex - shop film set for the new @entity25 adaptation of @entity30 's book , a @entity22 , starring @entity31 , right residents complained to the @entity33 unaware the ' store ' was a film set for the adaptation the drama is based on the @entity22 , written by @entity30 , pictured , published in 2012 the cast of high - profile adaptation of @entity30 ’s bestselling book , have spoken of how the fake shop was branded a ‘ disgrace ’ but also how some sheepish residents came in to browse the aisles , only to be turned away by the film crew			1
and @entity47 star @entity46 , 73 , said the three - part series could be the last time fans see her on screen for several months , revealing she has had to turn down work after breaking her knee			1
the 2012 novel from the @entity55 author , 49 , tells the story of the fictional village of @entity58			1
its dark themes of drug addiction , sexual abuse and suicide saw it sell one million copies in its first three weeks			1
but it was the lingerie store of character @entity67 , played by @entity31 , that drew the ire of @entity4 residents when their village became the backdrop for the book ’s twisting tale			1
speaking at a preview of the series , director @entity75 revealed the locals ’ anger at thinking a sex shop had opened in their quiet streets			1
although , he also admitted the makeshift store did get some enquiring visitors			2
he said : ‘ they did mistake it for the real thing and complained about it at the local parish council meeting , they said it was a disgrace			1
‘ but there were a couple of occasions when we were filming and an old lady , white hair and a stick , was walking past looking in the window			2
we said , “ please excuse ...			2
” , she said , “ oh no , i ’ve got all that stuff			2
” ‘ someone came in , they thought there was a sale on so we found people looking round at some of the stuff , it was amusing			2
’ the adaptation which stars @entity31 , left and @entity46 , right , will be broadcast next month unlike the fictional @entity111 , where drug addiction and murky local politics seem to be the norm , @entity4 paints a very different picture			1
built largely of stone from a local quarry , it is one of the best preserved villages in the @entity7 and sits in an area of @entity122 , one of 38 such areas across @entity125 and @entity126			1
with a population of barely over 2,000 it is a quiet community but one that is full of history			2
its parish church , which dates back nearly 1,000 years , gave refuge to the @entity132 during the @entity133			2
there are reportedly 99 yew trees growing in the courtyard , with legend claiming the @entity138 refuses to let a one hundredth take root			2
but even the charms of @entity4 do not seem to be enough to lure @entity47 star @entity46 , who plays @entity142 in @entity22 , back to rural life			1
she quit the countryside for @entity145 some years ago and claimed at monday ’s screening to have no regrets at abandoning the small village lifestyle			0
she said : ‘ i lived in the @entity7 for about 14 years , i lived in @entity149 which was actually one of the areas where we filmed			1
i can tell you there ’s a lot of politics in village life			0
‘ in my particular village for instance , there were some very wealthy people who wanted to buy a new notice board			0
the arguments about whether it should have a front of glass or on this side or over that side - they gave up because they did n’t want to buy it any more			0
they do n’t have anything else to do but keep an eye on other people			0
it ’s very political on villages			0
’ her turn in the series may be the last time she graces screens for several months following breaking her knee at the end of last year			0
speaking about the injury for the first time , she said : ‘ i broke my knee cap , @entity145 streets are not paved with gold i ’m afraid , they are pitfalls			0
i went straight over with an arm full of shopping in november			0
‘ i thought it would just get better , i thought it was just swollen and i ’d be all right			0
but it was n’t and i had actually fractured my knee cap			0
‘ for the last two months i ’ve been in a leg brace with iron bits and good knows what , sitting with my foot up all the time			0
i ca n’t do with out my crutch at the moment , i ’ve lost my confidence a bit			0
‘ i ’m just about to start physio , i ’m doing some gentle work now and then i ’ll go into about three months of physio			0
i ca n’t bend it , it ’s so sore			0
‘ i ’ve had to turn down a couple of things which might have taken me into the year but it ’s ok			0
half the time i actually look for an excuse not to work these days			0
