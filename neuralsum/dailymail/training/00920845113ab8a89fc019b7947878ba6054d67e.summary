by @entity0 for @entity1 nobody likes to part with their money to pay a dreaded parking fine but a trainee paramedic did just that for a complete stranger who was visiting her dying mother			1
after spending sleepless nights in a palliative care home in @entity12 by her mother ’s side , @entity9 was slapped with a parking fine and put it in her handbag to deal with at a later date			1
but just a few days later mrs @entity9 was astonished to receive a handwritten note in the post from paramedic @entity21 , who had helped transport mrs @entity9 ’s mother to her house to spend her final days , saying he paid the $ 29 fine which he had found in the ambulance			1
‘ most people would ’ve picked that up and thrown that in the bin and not have given it a second thought , ’ mrs @entity9 told @entity1			2
‘ we just could n’t believe that a stranger would bother to do that for someone			0
’ trainee paramedic @entity21 found the $ 29 fine in his ambulance and decided to pay the fee as a kind gesture to @entity9 who was dealing with her mother 's final days mr @entity21 sent the receipt for the paid infringement and a post-it note explaining why he had decided to pay the fine			1
‘ i also wanted to pay the fine for you given the difficult time you and your family are going through , ’ the note said			1
once getting over the passing of her mother , mrs @entity9 began to ring around a few weeks ago to find out where mr @entity21 worked to thank him for his kind gesture			2
‘ everyone i spoke to said “ that ’s him - he ’s just genuinely nice person – he ’s like that all of the time ” , ’ she said			0
‘ he ’s in his second year in paramedics at uni so he ’s perfect for the job – it ’s nice to know there are people out there like him looking after others			0
’ @entity9 ( right ) and her sister @entity64 with a photo of their mother , @entity66 , who passed away in july she was able to meet up with mr @entity21 recently to express her gratitude in person			2
‘ he takes it all in his stride – he does n’t think he ’s done anything too fantastic but we are the opposite we think it ’s extremely kind , ’ she said			0
‘ so we wanted him to get some sort of recognition because every time you turn on the tv somebody is ripping somebody off all of the time and this just so the opposite			0
’ mrs @entity9 said although the cost of the fine was only $ 29 – it meant so much more to her and the rest of her family			1
‘ to us it did n’t matter how much it was - it may as well have been $ 1,000 , ’ she said			0
‘ he ’s going to uni so i ’m sure he ’s got uni fees so for him to do that is fantastic			0
