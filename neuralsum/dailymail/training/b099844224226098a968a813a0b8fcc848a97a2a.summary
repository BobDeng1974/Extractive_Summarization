by @entity0 for @entity1 follow @ @entity2 @entity3 and @entity4 are no stranger to one another in the @entity7 group stage			1
they meet at the @entity9 on wednesday night for the fifth time in the past three years			1
and it ’s fair to say their encounters invariably throw up headline news			0
here , @entity15 takes a look at their previous meetings … @entity3 and @entity4 face each other for the fifth time in just three years on wednesday , with @entity19 ( left ) key to @entity22 's side 's chances and @entity23 ( right ) pivotal for @entity24 @entity25 – 27 sep , 2011 , group stage with @entity3 trailing by two and with more than half an hour left on the clock , @entity27 instructed substitute @entity29 to get warmed up			1
the @entity30 , infamously , refused			0
and so began a saga which saw @entity29 exiled from the first team for six months , @entity27 having said after the game that he would never play for the club again			0
the visitors had earlier been outclassed and were blown away by a @entity36 double before the break			0
@entity29 refused to come off the bench for @entity3 in the 2 - 0 loss at @entity4 in september 2011 @entity36 bagged a brace for the home side as they ran out 2 - 0 victors in @entity7 group stage after refusing to come on as a substitute , @entity29 was dropped from the side until the following march first he reacted quickest after @entity47 had saved @entity49 ’s free - kick , and again he seized upon a rebound from the goalkeeper to make it two			1
city found little by way of a response after half - time but it was @entity29 ’s refusal to aid his team - mates ’ cause which made the headlines			1
he returned to the team in march and played a key role in their title victory , earning forgiveness for his meltdown in @entity68			0
@entity47 can only watch as @entity36 puts @entity4 ahead against @entity3 at the @entity69 @entity27 could only watch the match with his head in his hands as @entity3 succumbed to a 2 - 0 loss city 2 - 0 @entity4 – 7 dec , 2011 , group stage the significance of a win over @entity4 - albeit a weakened version - was relegated by events elsewhere as @entity80 beat @entity81 to claim second place behind the @entity84 table toppers			1
for defeats in @entity86 and @entity87 meant @entity27 ’s side had surrendered their own fate going into the final group game			2
nonetheless , they saw home their end of the bargain and , for a while , it looked as though they might just scrape through into the knockout stages			2
@entity98 scored @entity3 's opener during a 2 - 0 win over @entity4 in december 2011 @entity3 stars @entity19 ( left ) and @entity102 ( right ) congratulate scorer @entity98 ( centre ) but when news filtered through that @entity107 had scored for @entity80 in @entity108 , an eerie silence descended on the @entity109			1
earlier , @entity98 fired a sublime opener as he defied the odds to locate the bottom corner with a sweet left - footed strike			2
@entity114 had been the provider for that goal and he again assisted as @entity117 added a second after the break with a low poke having been slipped through on goal			0
but it mattered not and the @entity123 beckoned for @entity27 ’s men			0
@entity117 ( fourth right ) is congratulated after netting @entity3 's second against @entity4 at the @entity109 city 1 - 3 @entity4 – 2 oct , 2013 , group stage a win for @entity68 ? or a defeat for @entity3 ? for the hosts were so poor that @entity4 barely had to break sweat			1
but one man who was left sweating on his place in the @entity3 side was @entity47 after a horror performance which raised questions over his credentials as @entity139 ’s no 1			1
the game was only seven minutes old when he allowed @entity49 ’s shot from range to escape his grasp and snake across the line			0
@entity47 had a night to forget against @entity4 in october 2013 as @entity3 succumbed to a 3 - 1 loss at the @entity109 @entity147 puts @entity4 2 - 0 up as @entity47 can only watch on during the @entity7 group - stage match @entity47 's poor performance eventually led to him being dropped from the @entity3 side following the @entity4 match @entity102 was another enduring a torrid evening and he was at fault as @entity147 skipped clear before rounding @entity47 for @entity4 ’s second			1
by the hour mark it was three , @entity23 beating the forlorn @entity102 with ease before firing beyond @entity47 who made a feeble attempt to cover his near post			0
a late rally - in which @entity159 scored a fine consolation and @entity161 was sent off the visitors - did not mask what was a worrying display , particularly from @entity47 who was subsequently benched			0
@entity98 hits the bar for @entity3 against @entity4 during the 3 - 1 loss at the @entity109 in october 2013 @entity23 ( left ) congratulates @entity49 ( right ) after the @entity166 put the away side ahead @entity102 ( right ) and @entity98 ( left ) of @entity3 walk off despondently after the 3 - 1 loss to @entity4 @entity24 ( left ) , @entity4 's manager , gives his team instructions as @entity22 ( right ) looks on @entity173 's @entity172 time is now - @entity24 @entity174 – 12 dec , 2013 , group stage this was supposed to be the night when @entity3 came of age in @entity172 , reversing a two - goal deficit to win at the home of the @entity172 champions			1
instead , it was a different number for which the thrilling contest was remembered - away goals , or rather , @entity22 ’s failure to grasp the concept of them			0
a 4 - 2 victory would have taken @entity3 through as group champions , the result bettering @entity4 ’s 3 - 1 win at the @entity109 with the sides level on points			1
and @entity22 ’s maths malfunction - which saw him put on @entity194 rather than @entity19 when they should have been chasing a fourth goal - cost his team dear as they were drawn against @entity199 in the next round and were duly eliminated			2
it had , though , been a devastating display			0
@entity202 holds his finger aloft after completing @entity3 's comeback win in december 2013 @entity205 equalised from the penalty spot for @entity3 before @entity202 's winner in a 3 - 2 victory at @entity69 @entity98 ( right ) had scored @entity3 's first goal as they came back to win but it was not enough to top the group they were trailing by two inside 12 minutes			1
@entity147 raced clear before finishing beyond @entity47 - restored to the side having been dropped in october - and the goalkeeper was picking the ball from his net soon after when @entity218 prodded in from close range			2
@entity3 had played a weakened team for what had appeared a dead rubber and it was one of those brought in , @entity202 , who was key to their comeback			2
first , on 28 minutes , he nodded into the path of @entity98 who halved the deficit			0
it was then @entity202 who won the penalty from which @entity230 drew parity just before the hour mark			0
and so it was left to @entity202 himself to produce a stunning winner with a measured curler from the edge of the area			0
substitute @entity159 was denied by @entity240 as @entity3 came close to a fourth and top spot , it was just a shame @entity22 had n’t realised such			2
@entity22 can only look on after miscalculating the number of goals his side needed to top the group @entity114 ( left ) , @entity205 ( second left ) , @entity98 ( second right ) and @entity247 ( right ) celebrate @entity205 's goal @entity147 ( right ) have put @entity4 1 - 0 up against @entity3 after just 12 minutes with this strike			1

@entity3 and @entity4 have met four times in three *seasons*
this is third time sides have been drawn in same @entity7 group
both sides have won two games apiece , one each home and away
@entity4 lead 7 - 6 on *aggregate* across the four previous @entity172 meetings
