a dating expert spent the day posing as a damsel in distress in a bid to find out if men are more likely to approach a woman because of the way she is dressed			2
@entity7 donned three very different outfits to play the part of a lost tourist outside of a busy @entity12 tube station for the social experiment titled ' does changing the clothes change the woman ? ' the @entity12 - based dating professional tested the relationship between what a woman wears , and whether that alters the likelihood of her being approached by a possible suitor			1
the video shows that @entity7 had the most success when she changed into a sexy , tight - fitting bodycon dress , knee length ' stripper heels ' and a leather jacket			2
@entity7 played the part of a lost tourist outside of a busy @entity12 tube station for the experiment the least ' sexy ' of the outfits was the casual hoody , t - shirt and trainers combination @entity7 noted the speed at which men approached her was much higher in her ' stripper heels ' outfit @entity7 , who says she has helped more than 100,000 men find love , said : ' there were a lot of interesting differences between the three outfits			1
' i did n't necessarily get approached by more men while i was wearing the sex kitten outfit with the stripper heels			1
i would say i was helped out just as much ' but guys definitely checked me out more in that outfit , it was more blatant			0
' and one thing that i did notice was that the speed at which i was approached was much higher - a guy nearly killed himself on a bike stopping to help me			0
the relationship expert points out that men actually approach women fairly infrequently over all @entity7 found that she overall was offered help a similar number of times no matter what she was wearing the brave dating expert points out that men should n't think good looking women are approached ' all the time ' ' that was the longest interaction i got during the whole day , and when i wore the hoody and trainers i had the shortest interaction			1
' so the length of time guys spend interacting with a woman definitely seems to increase the hotter the girl looks			0
' overall though it seems like men just are n't approaching women			0
but this just shows that if men are thinking ' she must get approached all the time ' - no she does n't , so if you can be the guy that does that then hallelujah			0

played part of a lost tourist outside of a @entity12 tube station
wore three different outfits of different levels of ' sexiness '
did n't get approached more often in the tight dress and heels
however men were *faster* to offer help and spent longer assisting her
