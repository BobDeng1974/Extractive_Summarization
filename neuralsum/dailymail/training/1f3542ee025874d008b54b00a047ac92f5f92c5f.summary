scientists hope to be able to beat obesity within years by ' rewiring ' brains to reduce appetites after researchers made a significant breakthrough			1
they hope to develop drugs that can control the amount we eat from infancy , or later in life for those who are overweight			1
it is hoped the findings could lead to a ' permanent solution ' for tackling obesity within years			1
obesity battle : scientists hope to develop a pill which can stop obesity within years after a breakthrough by researchers at the @entity22 scientists had thought nerve cells in the brain associated with appetite control were produced in the womb and could not be changed			1
but new research has identified a group of stem cells capable of triggering new appetite - regulating neurons in mice in an area of the brain known as the hypothalmus			1
the @entity22 scientists hope to apply their findings to humans within five to 10 years			2
dr @entity39 said : ' unlike dieting , translation of this discovery could eventually offer a permanent solution for tackling obesity			2
' loss or malfunctioning of neurons in the hypothalamus is the prime cause of eating disorders such as obesity			2
' until recently we thought all of these nerve cells were generated during the embryonic period and so the circuitry that controls appetite was fixed			0
' but this study has shown the neural circuitry that controls appetite is not fixed in number and could possibly be manipulated numerically to tackle eating disorders			0
weight battle : children with obese mothers could be given medicine to control their appetite at birth ' our hope is that drugs could effect these stem cells in such a way that more appetite suppressing neurons are produced , or even appetite suppressing ones			1
this means babies , for instance , with obese mothers could be primed from infancy to eat less			1
' but although our main objective is to combat obesity with this , it could also work at the other end of the spectrum			0
anorexics could be made to produce more appetite promoting neurons , so they eat more			2
' the findings were published in the @entity87			0
obesity has reached epidemic proportions globally causing rising rates of type 2 diabetes , heart disease , arthritis and cancer			0
the economic burden on the @entity96 in the @entity97 is estimated to be more than £ 5billion annually			1
in the @entity99 , the healthcare cost tops $ 60billion			0
the researchers say their findings could help develop drugs that could one day lead to a permanent intervention in infancy for those predisposed to obesity , or later in life as the disease becomes apparent			0
more than 1.4billion adults worldwide are overweight and more than half a billion are obese			0
and at least 2.8million people die each year as a result of being overweight or obese			2
the hypothalamus section of the brain regulates sleep and wake cycles , energy expenditure , appetite , thirst , hormone release and many other critical biological functions			0
looking specifically at the nerve cells that regulate appetite , the researchers used a genetic mapping technique tracking the development of stem cells and cells derived from them , at desired time points during the life of an animal			1
they established a population of brain cells called ' tanycytes ' behave like stem cells and add new neurons to the appetite - regulating circuitry of the mouse brain after birth and into adulthood			1
dr @entity39 said : ' the next step is to define the group of genes and cellular processes that regulate the behaviour and activity of tanycytes			0
' this information will further our understanding of brain stem cells and could be exploited to develop drugs that can modulate the number or functioning of appetite - regulating neurons			1
' our long term goal of course is to translate this work to humans , which could take up to five or ten years			0
it could lead to a permanent intervention in infancy for those predisposed to obesity , or later in life as the disease becomes apparent			0

stem cells in the brain trigger neurons that control our appetites
scientists believe they will be able to control the neurons with pills ' within years '
babies with obese mothers could be given medicine at birth so that they eat less
obesity costs the @entity96 £ 5billion a year
