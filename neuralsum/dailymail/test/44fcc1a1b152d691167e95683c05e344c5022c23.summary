@entity0 : groups of men and women were asked whether they would kill a young @entity4 to prevent @entity5 it is a classic question of morality - if you could travel back in time and prevent the @entity5 by killing a young @entity4 , would you ? you could hypothetically save millions of lives - but at the cost of personally murdering someone who had yet to do anything wrong			1
the answer , according to a recent scientific study , has a lot to do with your gender ; and women are far more reluctant to cause any harm in the short term in order to get a better result in the long run			2
researchers from @entity25 , @entity26 and the @entity27 analysed answers to the @entity4 question , and others like it , from 6,100 people			1
they found that significantly more men than women would kill to save lives further down the line , while women were more troubled by the act itself and would often decide to do nothing			1
other dilemmas tested included a scenario where a group of people were hiding from soldiers trying to kill them , but were about to be given away by a baby crying			0
the choice is whether to smother the child and save the group , or keep it alive and be caught			0
a third imagined a farming family who had fallen on hard times and had no food to eat			0
their only way to avoid starvation would be to have their young daughter carry out sex work for money			0
the study , published in the @entity62 , grouped the responses into two groups			2
those who chose short - term harm to get an overall better result were termed utilitarians			0
the other group , for whom the ends could not justify the means , were called deontologists			2
differences : the study revealed that women are more reluctant than men to do something harmful in the short - term to secure a better result in the long term ( file photo ) hard times : another question imagined that the only way out of poverty and stavation was making a young girl do sex work for money ( file photo ) the scientists found that men were moderately more likely to fall into the utilitarian camp , while in women there was a very pronounced trend to go the opposite way			1
other data also suggested that women found the decisions more agonizing than the men , who had relatively straightforward time coming to their conclusion			1
@entity105 , one of the researchers , who is based at @entity107 in @entity108 , @entity26 , said that the results seem to show women employ more emotion making their decisions , while men go more on logic alone			1
as the women had stronger , competing urges in each scenario , they found the dilemmas more difficult			2
explaining her study to @entity122 , she said : ' women seem to be feeling more equal levels of both emotion and cognition			0
they seem to be experiencing similar levels of both , so it 's more difficult for them to make their choice			0

researchers in @entity27 , @entity26 and @entity25 analyzed 6,100 responses
found men were more likely than women to say ends justify the means
*whichever* way they decided , women also found the decisions harder
scientists *speculated* it is because women 's *reasoning* is more emotional
