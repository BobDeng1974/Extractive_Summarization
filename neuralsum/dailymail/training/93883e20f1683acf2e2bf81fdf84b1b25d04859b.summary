the former @entity8 and @entity10 player accused @entity5 of being chokers , who would be ' no problem ' for @entity8			1
both @entity13 and @entity14 had spoken in the last few days as saying that @entity5 had a better chance against @entity8 than at this time last year , and that the north @entity18 side had raised their level in the last 12 months			2
if @entity8 concentrate , they wo n’t have any problems			0
you see it in the @entity43 : @entity5 always mess things up in big games			1
' the former @entity10 man also had a lot of criticism for his compatriots at @entity5 , saying that @entity50 ' still needs to work on his physicality ' , and that he was surprised with how well @entity29 had settled in the @entity43			1
' i did n’t think he ’d make it in @entity54 , to be honest , he was always far too lazy at @entity8 and @entity55 ' , said @entity3			2
soft : @entity3 criticised @entity50 ( right ) for lacking the required physicality to excel in the @entity43 outspoken : @entity3 has been out of work since being sacked by @entity59 as their manager in 2012 qualified praise : @entity3 did however say that @entity63 had shown enough fight to ' impress the @entity65 ' for @entity5 ’s third @entity67 star , @entity3 was full of praise , albeit of a slightly backhanded nature : ' @entity63 is rated very highly , because he ’s fought his way into this team			1
his performances have n’t been amazing of late , but he fights , and that impresses the @entity65 '			0
@entity3 is convinced , though , that even @entity63 ’s fight will not be enough to stop @entity8			2
he rates this @entity8 side as one of the best ever , saying that @entity76 , @entity77 and @entity78 will one day be mentioned in the same breath as @entity80 , @entity81 and @entity82			0
final preparations : @entity8 train in @entity35 ahead of their visit to @entity18 to take on @entity5 @entity86 turn : @entity88 works out in training before @entity8 's @entity7 clash with @entity5 legacy : @entity3 believes current players such as @entity76 ( right ) and @entity77 can become club legends targets : @entity3 suggested @entity8 pursue a deal for @entity96 ( right ) over @entity98 's @entity97 ( left ) the former @entity100 international , who has a well documented love for @entity54 football and @entity54 since his time in @entity10 , also said that he would not advise @entity8 sign @entity98 ’s @entity97			1
' he ’s a great player , and it ’s good that he can play in midfield too , but if they were going to sign someone from the @entity43 , i would advise them to get @entity96			0
' whether @entity110 , @entity111 will follow his advice , though , seems unlikely			0
@entity3 has been out of a coaching job since he was sacked by @entity114 in 2012			0
a year beforehand , he was forced to leave @entity115 just months after leading them to promotion , following a breakdown in relations with the club hierarchy .			0
