he is arguably the most famous astronaut since @entity1 and @entity2 after performing @entity4 ’s @entity3 on his guitar while he was more than 200 miles above the @entity6			1
to date , commander @entity8 ’s video – shot in the @entity9 ( @entity9 ) – has had 25 million viewings on @entity11 and even has the backing of the rock star himself , who declared it the most ‘ poignant ’ version of his hit			1
but as if that was n’t enough , the @entity9 commander ’s fan base has gone stratospheric after he used his free time on board the floating laboratory to snap a series of stunning photographs of @entity6 and upload them to the world via a @entity29 link after taking personal requests from people around the globe			0
tomorrow , the 55 - year - old @entity52 astronaut , who retired last year , will touch down briefly in @entity53 and @entity54 as part of a tour of book signings and entertaining presentations about his photographs and life among the stars			1
he laughs as he admits he is as thrilled to be returning to @entity40 as he was on his repeat visits to space			2
seriously ? ‘ i love @entity40 , ’ he says , emphatically			1
‘ my grandmother ’s family are from the @entity67 and i ’ve been to @entity40 many times over the years			2
in the 1820s , her family sent the eldest son to @entity52 , sort of like a space probe being launched today , to see how it was			1
he ended up in @entity74 and never looked back			0
the rest , as they say , is history			0
’ on a mission : @entity8 's performance of @entity4 ’s @entity3 has had 25 million viewings on @entity11 he added : ‘ it ’s kind of funny that i ended up doing the same sort of thing , but to space , all these years later			1
’ his crystal - clear images of @entity87 , the @entity88 and the @entity89 and @entity91 estuaries thrilled thousands in the @entity92 when they were broadcast last year			1
former first minister @entity93 was so taken with the photographs that he tweeted the astronaut his praise as well as inviting him to visit			2
from the @entity9 , commander @entity8 , who now has 1.2 million followers on @entity101 , replied : ‘ i ’d love to visit @entity40 again once back on @entity6			1
i ’ve been from @entity102 to @entity103 , but there ’s so much more to see and do			0
’ on his way back from his last space mission in may last year , when his plane stopped off briefly in @entity40 en route to the @entity109 , he tweeted again : ‘ on the ground in @entity111 , to refuel			1
was 1st here in 1977 – who could have predicted this ? ’ the astronaut representing the @entity119 stands on a @entity52 - built robot arm in 2001 the astronaut believes his images have been such a phenomenal success because they strike a chord in the heart of everyone			1
he said : ‘ everyone ’s curious about how their part of the world looks from space and how it fits into everywhere else			1
it ’s such an unusual and unique perspective to see the world that way			0
‘ so , while i was in orbit , i was emailing my son and it was his idea that i should take photographs of @entity6			2
he suggested asking everyone down below for their ideas			0
' it had an immediate impact , with requests coming in from people asking me to take their part of the world			0
it was n’t just some sort of narcissism			0
people genuinely wanted to see how it all looked			0
’ he added : ‘ it was terrific fun but it took a bit of planning			1
i would wake up every morning in the space station , launch the laptop in my sleep pod and log on to @entity159			1
' i ’d scan through to see where we were going to be getting close to , then i ’d check out the weather to see if it was cloudy or stormy and when that country was going to be in daylight			0
@entity8 wowed @entity167 followers with this photograph of the @entity87 shot out of the window of his capsule in space ‘ if i thought it was going to work , i ’d set the alarm to give myself a ten - minute warning			1
sometimes , still wiping the sleep from my eyes or , if i was working on an experiment , suddenly my alarm would go off and i ’d float over using the handrail , grab the camera and get the best position at the window after checking out the sun and the angle			0
the @entity9 has a three dimensional bay window with enormous panes			0
they can get a bit smeared from people floating into them or looking out all the time			0
but i ’d look for an unblemished spot on the glass and start taking pictures			0
once i was finished , i put the memory card in my pocket , continued working and uploaded the images to a @entity29 link overnight			2
‘ i never actually saw many of the images i took , so that ’s the reason for the book			1
’ divided up by continent , the selected images in the book represent one orbit of the @entity9 and his planetary photo tour is punctuated with fun and fascinating commentary on life in zero gravity			1
a presentation by him tomorrow at the @entity213 is a sell - out , with all profits from the book going to the @entity217			1
another image taken from 250 miles above the @entity6 's surface offers a unique view of @entity40 # s mainland his favourite moments in orbit , not surprisingly , came during space walks , where the jaw - dropping beauty of the galaxy made it difficult to concentrate on the sometimes menial tasks in hand			2
he said : ‘ i ’ve spent 15 hours outside , with nothing between me and space except a spacesuit			1
there is nothing like that feeling of travelling through the universe with the @entity6 in the distance			0
‘ as humans , we get used to being on our planet , looking up to the universe			2
but actually being in the universe , looking down on the planet , is awe - inspiring			0
‘ there ’s a visual allure in space that can make it hard to keep your mind on the job in hand because there are so many amazing things to see			1
the endless depths of space fill your thoughts and every time you are carrying out a task , you find yourself checking on the view			2
’ his vivid description conjures up images of the blockbuster gravity , starring @entity264 and @entity265 as astronauts caught up in a catastrophic set of events in space			1
‘ has he seen it ? ’ i ask			1
@entity8 was the first @entity52 to walk in space			1
he recently returned from a five month - stint in on the @entity9 where he served as commander the man who was the top graduate of the @entity109 @entity275 in 1988 and the @entity277 test pilot of the year in 1991 before being hand - picked a year later by the @entity119 to be an astronaut laughs as he says : ‘ yes , i think i was the first astronaut to see gravity			1
of course , the storyline is pure @entity281 and you have to suspend your disbelief			0
' but visually it ’s great			0
i think it captures that fundamental sense of the enormity , of space being around you and the @entity6 somewhere nearby			2
’ his music video , a zero - gravity version of @entity4 ’s song , received more than ten million views in its first three days online and had a profound effect on many who saw it – including its creator			1
the astronaut said : ‘ @entity4 said it was the most poignant cover of his song			1
why ? i think it ’s because it crosses over from fantasy to reality			0
for years , the whole “ ground control to @entity305 ” thing was an idea			0
then a spaceman made it actually happen			0
’ former first minister @entity93 was so taken with the photographs that he tweeted the astronaut his praise as well as inviting him to visit he added : ‘ maybe it ’s my @entity40 ancestry but i ’ve always been musical on a local pub level and i ’ve got one of those brains that remembers all the lines			1
but i ’d never covered @entity4 before			2
my brother and i had recorded a @entity322 which i performed from the iss. my son @entity323 encouraged me to try @entity3 and to begin with i only did it to humour him			0
‘ i ’d no idea it would take off the way it did			2
i recorded vocals and guitar			0
back on @entity6 , @entity323 organised the piano accompaniment and other instruments			0
it ’s now been watched more than 25 million times , which is frankly incredible			1
’ he has no regrets about never returning to space now that he ’s retired			2
‘ i ’ve led a varied life and i do n’t sit around thinking about it			2
i ’m moving on to the next phase			0
‘ i might go back to school and learn about palaeontology or the human genome			0
or trying to address the problems of climate change			0
’ it ’s clear that the astronaut will never leave the man			2
for someone for whom the sky has never been a limit , he is still aiming high .			0
