@entity1 camp : the occupation could cost around £ 1million in lost tourist revenue after @entity4 's closed its doors on friday the anti-capitalist protest forcing @entity7 to close is a ‘ big charade ’ with only one in ten tents occupied overnight , the @entity11 can reveal			1
footage from a thermal imaging camera shot by a police helicopter revealed that the ramshackle camp is almost completely empty during the cold nights			1
it suggests the majority of the 300 ‘ defiant ’ protesters at the cathedral return home or to hotels after dark to sleep in warm beds			1
@entity26 councillor @entity24 said : ‘ it ’s incredible			1
the overnight monitoring of the site by the police showed that 90 per cent of the tents are unoccupied			1
' it just shows most of the demonstrators do n’t have the courage of their convictions and are just here to make trouble			2
‘ leaving your tent here overnight is a good way to do it			1
it ’s a phantom camp – a big charade			1
’ @entity4 ’s shut for the first time since @entity47 last week after the site doubled in size in a week and the demonstrators refused to move			2
the protesters discussed the number of empty tents in the camp at a meeting on sunday and made plans to organise a system to allocate them to any newcomers			1
discussing tactics : occupy @entity61 protesters outside @entity7 hold an evening meeting to discuss the location and nature of the banners at the campsite giant signs hang over the encampment denouncing capitalism , but many of the activists spent much of yesterday sitting in a @entity72 overlooking the churchyard , several working on laptops			1
however , most activists maintain a front of selfless commitment to their cause , with a sign attached to one tent proclaiming : ‘ all day , all week , we ’ll sleep on @entity61 ’s freezing streets			2
@entity82 ! ’ an activist at the centre of the @entity86 demonstration and @entity88 ’s protest camp is the son of a property developer it emerged last night			1
but 21 - year - old @entity91 says he does not want to benefit from his father ’s success			0
mr @entity91 , who is studying a philosophy degree at @entity95 , insisted : ‘ i ’m an anarchist and i do n’t believe in leadership			0
‘ i ’m not set to inherit this fortune			0
i do n’t believe in property			0
‘ my father has done very well for himself but i do n’t intend to do what he does			0
he has gone along with the capitalist system			0
’ his 54 - year - old father , @entity102 , is the director of @entity103 , which owns the @entity103 building – a £ 10million development in @entity61			1
until 2008 mr @entity91 was registered as living with his father in one of the 14 luxury flats , which sell for more than £ 1.5million and cost up to £ 1,500 per week to rent			0
the protest is one of several in @entity111 , inspired by the @entity113 movement in @entity114 , intended to highlight inequalities caused by mismanagement of the economy			2
the revelation about the part - time protesters came as it emerged that any legal move to evict the camp would be likely to drag on for months			1
but @entity4 ’s is facing increasing pressure to take legal action to try to remove the protesters			2
mr @entity24 said : ‘ the church has to make a decision and the sooner the better			1
‘ it is frustrating , but they are just muddling through the best they can			0
‘ if this church stays closed there ’s going to be tremendous trouble			0
‘ it could stay closed for @entity134 , and even @entity135			0
’ @entity136 , conservative mp for @entity137 , said : ‘ @entity4 ’s is a @entity138 and they have turned it into a @entity141 shanty town			0
‘ there ’s masses of space in front of the entrance and yet the doors are shut			0
i ’d love to have an explanation for that			0
’ a @entity151 spokesman said : ‘ we continue to use a range of techniques to facilitate peaceful protests			0
’ he added : ‘ we are constantly assessing the site and continue to provide low - key policing that facilitates peaceful protest while minimising disruption to the local people			2
’ unhappy hordes : the protesters have set up an ' overflow ' campsite in @entity165 's @entity164 near the cathedral season 's strife : the demonstrators ' plans to stay until @entity135 could force the cathedral to cancel a swathe of events and services			2
