by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 07:59 est , 6 february 2014 @entity3 : 02:41 est , 7 february 2014 a £ 100million plan to redirect train services in @entity6 and @entity7 could be revived after huge waves washed the line away			1
the government revealed said the army could be called in to help repair the track at @entity13 after huge waves demolished the sea wall on the south coast			1
but transport secretary @entity16 today announced he has ordered a ‘ rigorous review ’ into alternatives , after the last @entity18 government rejected the need to reroute the line			1
the destruction of @entity13 's railway line has effectively cut off rail links to @entity7 , with a 200ft stretch of tracks left mangled and hanging over the boiling seas			1
on the seafront huge granite blocks had been ripped out by the force of the crashing waves and gales and 20 homes had to be evacuated and people moved to a leisure centre			0
@entity64 has warned the line , built by @entity66 and popular for its stunning view , could be out of action for weeks			2
@entity18 warned the closures are costing the area millions in lost revenue , with the @entity73 's crucial tourism industry threatened by the loss of a vital transport link			1
mr @entity16 last night held urgent talks with @entity64 and mps from @entity6 and @entity7			1
troops could be called in to help @entity64 to repair the line to get services moving as soon as possible @entity64 said both tracks has been severely damaged by the sea , washing away ballast and the foundations on which the track is built in 2006 the @entity86 said one day it would be necessary to replace or move key transport links like the @entity13 line transport secretary @entity16 has offered the help of the @entity91 to @entity64 to repair the line at @entity13 while communities secretary @entity93 hit out at the @entity95 's attitude to local people the @entity95 faced fresh criticism today over its refusal to react to the demands of local people hit by the floods			1
communities secretary @entity93 said questions would have to be asked about the ‘ local accountability ’ of quangos and the decision to stop dredging the rivers tone and @entity107 on the @entity108			1
and he condemned agency chief executive @entity109 , for suggesting there had to be a choice between protecting rural or urban areas			0
in the @entity113 today mr @entity93 hit back : ‘ we will work to defend both town and country			1
for the record , and with respect , i have to say that i do not agree with the comments of @entity109 , who implied that there was a choice between town and country			0
’ and raising the prospect of an overhaul of the @entity95 ’s powers , he added : ‘ as the dark skies clear , there will be lessons to be learned , from the way in which we help local authorities to the role of quangos and the need for their local accountability , the influence of man - made policies on dredging , the effect of tree planting on our landscape and rivers , and the resilience of our nation as a whole throughout the 21st century			1
’ in the @entity113 today he revealed he has ordered a report into ‘ the whole question of the resilience of the @entity150 ’			0
he told @entity77 : ‘ i am working with @entity64 to see that service is restored as quickly as possible but also to have a more rigorous review of some of the other alternatives which may be available			1
’ it raises the prospect of two lines closed half a century ago being reopened to carry trains away from the seafront			0
in 2006 @entity18 ministers ruled out the idea of re-routing			1
then - transport minister @entity163 said : ' @entity64 recognises the importance of the line and continues to devote considerable resources to maintaining it to an appropriate standard			2
' it does not believe that the railway sea defences in @entity13 are likely to fail in the foreseeable future , thanks to the work carried out and the ongoing maintenance and monitoring			0
' however at the time the @entity86 said : ‘ we are obviously going to have to think about one day replacing or moving key transport links like the @entity13 line			0
' now the dramatic destruction of the line means the idea is set to be revisited			2
one option is to reopen a 15 - mile stretch of the former @entity182 from @entity183 to @entity184 which was closed in 1958 , which would mean trains no longer stopped at @entity186 or @entity13			1
another more costly plan would be to revive the @entity189 line which links @entity183 to @entity190 via the northern edge of @entity192			1
it would mean there would be no rail services to @entity13 , @entity186 , @entity196 , @entity197 or @entity198 and take trains on a new 50 - mile route , adding to journey times			1
both options would be hugely expensive and controversial for those areas which would lose services			0
but ministers faced cross-party calls in the @entity113 for radical action and investment to solve the problem			0
@entity209 , @entity210 mp for @entity211 in the far south of @entity7 , said : if we are to put proper investment into a resilient service down to @entity215 we need to make sure that there is a comparable funding in terms of the kind of money which is being spent on @entity43 and other services			1
’ former labour cabinet minister @entity222 , mp for @entity183 , demanded to know what mr @entity16 is ‘ doing to ensure this vital mainline into the @entity150 is reopened as quickly as possible and what he is going to do in the long - term to help ensure that the vulnerability of the line at @entity13 is dealt with ’			1
homes overlooking the @entity13 line have been left hanging after the land gave way the fierce seas ripped a gaping hole in the coastal road , shattering tarmac and ripping holes in the the picturesque properties standing on the sea front , forcing residents to evacuate the government has found announced extra £ 30million to help councils deal with the damage caused by the severe weather outbreak			1
the money for this year is on top of £ 100million announced by @entity248 yesterday			2
communities secretary @entity93 said 42 new flood defence schemes are also planned for 2014 - 15 , as he hailed the government 's £ 3.1 billion capital investment commitment as the largest by any government			1
he told @entity77 : ' in the short - term , i can announce that the government will provide an additional £ 130million for emergency repairs and maintenance , £ 30million in the current year and £ 100million next year			2
' this will cover costs incurred during the current emergency response and recovery , as well as essential repairs to ensure that defences are maintained			0
' however , @entity265 leader @entity264 called for @entity267 ’s foreign aid budget worth £ 11billion to be immediately suspended with the money diverted to help areas in the @entity267 devastated by flooding			2
the @entity265 leader insisted ‘ charity begins at home ’ and urged the government to step up its response to the colossal damage to homes , businesses , roads and railways			0
mr @entity16 insisted that he takes his responsibilities to @entity6 and @entity7 ‘ incredibly seriously ’			1
‘ i also would like certainly point out that over the next five years between 2014 and 2019 @entity64 will be spending £ 38billion on the existing network			0
‘ there is not a shortage of understanding from this government as to the very important nature of rail services across the whole country			2
’ @entity290 , @entity291 mp for the @entity293 seat which includes @entity13 , said the line ‘ is a vital artery linking the @entity150 to @entity267 and a long term solution to coastal rail flooding must be found now ’			2
@entity299 leader @entity298 also demanded @entity255 help for the @entity150 following the latest storms			0
he said : ' once again we are cut off from the rest of the country by rail			2
now following the storm damage at @entity13 , the rest of the peninsula is also cut off and we do n't know when the line will be restored			2
the region deserves more help			0
we 've been told we just had the wettest january in memory			0
but that followed the wettest january in memory last year			0
' the time has come for the government to take more action to make sure that @entity6 and @entity7 do n't get cut off for weeks every winter			1
we need urgently to look at how our rail links can be better protected			0
’ @entity64 has called in a specialist concrete spraying machine to shore up the damaged section of seafront , with warnings the line could be out of action for up to six weeks			0
@entity326 , head of the @entity328 route , said : ' we absolutely understand the importance of the railway to the south west and will do everything we can to rebuild the railway at @entity13 as quickly and safely as we can			0
' after a quieter night ’s weather , we have been able to begin delivering machinery to our site compound with a view to protecting the exposed section of railway and the land behind it			0
we need to make sure we limit any further damage this weekend so that the significant repairs that are needed do not become greater still			0
' we will continue working with the government , @entity95 , local authorities and other partners to explore ways of improving the railway ’s resilience to extreme weather			2
the disruption to rail services in the south - west highlights the importance of that work and the need for all forms of transport to ensure that they are fit for the future			0
' @entity18 ; s shadow transport secretary @entity359 said : ' freak weather is rapidly becoming the new normal in our country , and i understand the difficulties you have in giving a timescale for the @entity13 repairs , given further bad weather is forecast for saturday			1
' but every week that this line is closed costs the regional economy tens of millions of pounds			0

@entity373 orders ' rigorous review ' of alternatives to coastal line
@entity16 offers the army to help repair track destroyed in storms
@entity18 government rejected idea of reopening lines further inland
@entity189 would be new 50 mile route , @entity29 line is 15 miles
@entity7 cut off from the rest of the country , *sparking* calls for more money
@entity393 criticise £ 50billion for @entity44 - @entity395 @entity43 link
