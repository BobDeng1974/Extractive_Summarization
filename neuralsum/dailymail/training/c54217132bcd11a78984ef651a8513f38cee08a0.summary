@entity0 has been named the world 's most influential city by business magazine @entity3 , despite @entity4 being a ' second rate power ' and over a century of ' imperial decline '			1
the city beat off stiff competition from @entity9 to claim the top spot while @entity11 came in a distant third ahead of @entity13 and @entity14			1
@entity0 was praised for its strong transport links , long history as a global financial hub and lack of regulations owing to its position outside the @entity22 and the eurozone			1
still tops : brilliant transport links and an absence of regulations mean @entity0 retains its position as the world 's most influential city trading hub : stock market trade in @entity9 levels are 10 times that of @entity0 and four times that of @entity14 @entity3 looked at eight key factors - the amount of foreign direct investment , the concentration of corporate headquarters , how many business niches they dominate , air connectivity , strength of producer services , financial services , technology and media power and racial diversity			1
as the choice of home for much of the world 's super-rich , @entity0 's enviable position as the historic capital of the @entity49 language contributes to its status as a powerful media hub and major advertising center , @entity3 notes			1
the magazine said : ' @entity0 not only has a long history as a dominant global financial hub , but its location outside the @entity22 and the eurozone keeps it away from unfriendly regulators			0
' compared to @entity9 , it is also time - zone advantaged for doing business in @entity66 , and has the second best global air connections of any city after @entity69 , with nonstop flights at least three times a week to 89 per cent of global cities outside of its home region of @entity75			2
' @entity0 now holds the position of @entity75 ’s top technology startup centre with more than 3,000 tech start up firms as well as @entity81 ’s largest office outside @entity82			2
however the magazine was quick to point out @entity0 is not the city it once was - and has suffered over a century of imperial decline while the @entity4 is now a ' second rate power '			2
@entity11 was in distant third place owing to it being home to almost all of @entity93 's home - grown companies neither it nor @entity9 could not consider themselves to be the powerhouses they were throughout the 20th century and while @entity11 managed to slip into third place most of their competitors are now from outside @entity75			1
@entity3 added : ' @entity11 may rank third in our survey , but it is way below @entity9 and @entity0 by virtually every critical measure , and the city ’s future is not promising given that @entity93 , and much of the @entity105 , are mired in relative economic stagnation			1
' elsewhere , @entity75 boast a veritable archipelago of globally competitive cities — @entity109 , @entity110 , @entity111 — but none is large enough , or unique enough , to break into the top 10 in the future			2
@entity66 is likely to place more cities at the top of the list			0
' the magazine also notes the continuing decline of @entity120 , once seen as a potential rival to @entity9			0
@entity120 , which has lost around 90,000 jobs since the end of the cold war , has suffered from a shrinking share of the entertainment and aerospace industries			0
last year alone major companies @entity129 , @entity130 and @entity131 moved out of the city for pastures new			0
@entity0 ( pop : 13 million , size : 607 square miles ) brilliant transport links and absence of regulations mean it 's still top despite declining imperial power and stiffer competition from outside @entity75 2			1
@entity9 ( pop : 8.4 million , size : 305 square miles ) a close second			0
home to most of the world 's top investment banks and hedge funds			1
its stock market trade levels are 10 times that of @entity0 and four times that of @entity14			0
@entity11 ( pop : 12,292,895 , size : 1,098 sq miles ) way back in third place , but @entity11 stays strong owing to it being home to almost all of @entity93 's home - grown companies			2
@entity13 ( pop : 5.3 million , size : 276 sq miles ) @entity162 city - it has been named as the best place in the world to do business and attracts the highest level of foreign direct investment			0
@entity14 ( pop : 13.3million , size : 844 square miles ) although it has fallen behind @entity13 as @entity66 's top business city in the @entity3 list , it is still the world 's largest city in terms of gross domestic product			1
@entity177 ( pop : 7.2 million , size : 426 square miles ) the largest financial centre in the world after @entity0 and @entity9 , @entity177 benefits from far greater freedom than the rest of @entity183			2
@entity69 ( pop : 2.1 million , size : 1588 sq miles ) @entity69 's unbeatable air links mean its the world 's most connected city for business			1
it also scores top for diversity with 86 per cent of its residents born abroad8			0
= @entity195 ( pop : 21 million , size : 6486 square miles ) home to most of @entity183 's state - owned companies as well as the country 's elite educational institutions and its most innovative companies			0
@entity195 is growing in importance by the year			0
= @entity204 ( pop 4.6 million , size : 4689 square miles ) a resources - fuelled boom means @entity209 's largest city fares strongly in the @entity3 list 10			1
= @entity211 ( pop : 4.5 million , size : 3,524.4 square miles ) a dramatic rise up the ranks owing to position as home to an enormous array of the world 's top technology companies			1
= @entity120 ( pop : 3.9 million , size : 502 square miles ) a falling giant			0
competition for @entity223 and an aerospace industry in decline mean major companies are moving out			0
= @entity226 ( pop 6 million , size : 243 square miles ) @entity228 's biggest city is a focus for international investment into the stable and resource rich country			0
