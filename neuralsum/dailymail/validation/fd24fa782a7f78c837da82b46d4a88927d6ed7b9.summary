it has sold more than 20 million copies since it was written two centuries ago and has had generations of schoolgirls swooning over the ultimate romantic hero			0
but the great unspoken background of @entity7 's world is that both mr @entity8 and mr @entity9 in @entity9 got rich from the slave trade , says author @entity11			1
the novelist , speaking at the @entity13 in @entity14 , dispelled the myth about mr @entity8 and mr @entity9 being the perfect men and described the ' very dark underbelly ' to @entity7 's books			1
she said : ' why does mr @entity9 in @entity9 have all this leisure to sort of drift between @entity9 and @entity21 ? the great unspoken background of @entity7 's world is that both mr @entity8 ( pictured , @entity22 ) and mr @entity9 in @entity9 got rich from the slave trade , says author @entity11 ' he is a young man with means because of the slave trade			1
the slave trade is lightly touched upon in several of the novels but not very heavily			0
' what built @entity29 ? @entity29 was built , one imagines , on proceeds of the coal mines in @entity32			0
what was the life of an 18th century miner like ? not much fun			0
' @entity11 , 71 , decided to shatter the illusion surrounding @entity7 's heroes after being approached by publishers @entity39 to write an updated version of @entity41 for the @entity42 in 2013			1
the series marked the 200 - year anniversary of the author 's most popular work , @entity9			1
@entity9 describes how mr @entity8 earned £ 10,000 a year - more than £ 200,000 in modern money - while mr @entity9 inherited £ 100,000 , the equivalent of £ 2 million today , and raked in another £ 5,000 a year , or £ 100,000 in modern money			1
but in her adaptation , ms @entity11 , whose reinvented characters say things like ' totes amazeballs ' , had to make one crucial change - she gave her protagonists jobs			2
' the only huge change i had to make was people had to work , ' she said at the festival			2
' in her novels , nobody works because the unspoken backdrop was the great commodity of the late 18th and early 19th century was sugar , which is not a million miles away from slavery			0
' there is a very dark underbelly to these stories , which is why i still get so irritated when people insist on treating @entity7 as if it was like the lid of a @entity75 tin , all sprig muslin and ' oh la sir '			2
' there is none of that			0
it 's tough stuff and clever women were doomed to a sort of infantilism because there was no career except marriage , which is why the women in her novels sabotage each other so disgracefully			0
' despite her reservations about how @entity7 's heroes made their money , ms @entity11 said she ended the project thinking the author was ' an absolute genius '			1
she said : ' there she was , the second daughter of a not very distinguished or noisy country parson in @entity99 , and she was writing for her own pleasure , her own satisfaction			0
' how did she know , out of some unbelievable instinct , that romantic love , class and money were going to be the stuff of fiction forever ? ' ms @entity11 , who said she ' stuck like paint ' to @entity7 's characters in her own adaptation , quickly realised the romantic novelist did not believe in happy ever after			1
the only characters @entity7 did not send up in @entity41 were @entity113 and colonel @entity114 , the two most steady figures in the book , said ms @entity11			2
she added : ' there is no such thing as happily ever after			0
that is why you can see in @entity7 novels she loses interest the moment the proposal is sorted and @entity124 is plainly going to marry @entity125 ' i you read the final paragraphs of her six published novels , you will see she just says : ' less of that and get on with it , not interested any more			2
' the adventure 's over			0
' she also blamed @entity135 ' @entity134 adaptation of @entity9 for sparking an obsession with mr @entity8 with the infamous scene by the lake , which did not exist in the book			1
the real mr @entity8 was ' stiff - necked and painfully shy ' with ' not much humour ' , said ms @entity11 .			1

@entity11 says it is the reason his job is never mentioned in novel
she wrote an updated version of @entity7 's @entity41 in 2013
says mr @entity9 and mr @entity8 reveal ' dark underbelly ' to author 's work
oscar *winner* @entity22 played mr @entity8 in the *tv* series aired in 1995
