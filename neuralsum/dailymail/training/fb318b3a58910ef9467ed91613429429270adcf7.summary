former @entity1 midfielder @entity0 insists he would love to return to @entity2 as boss - but only once the club 's boardroom battle has been settled			1
the @entity8 @entity7 winner , 37 , has been linked with the post vacated by @entity10 last month			2
but @entity0 - who was just 19 when he was signed for former @entity2 boss @entity11 - believes there is no point opening negotiations while there are so many factions fighting for control of the club			1
former @entity1 midfielder @entity0 admits he is interested in returning to the club as manager @entity22 's billionaire owner @entity21 is one of the suitors competing for control of @entity1 @entity21 is expected to hand chairman @entity25 a second emergency loan just in time for thursday 's pay cheques to go out			1
but @entity32 and the @entity33 - wealthy fans @entity29 , @entity30 and @entity31 - are rallying their troops ahead of a general meeting which could spell the end of the current directors ' reign			2
@entity39 and @entity40 manager @entity0 , who was back at @entity2 to play in @entity43 's charity match on sunday , said : ' i still have a lot of memories here			1
it was 15 years ago that i started to play here			0
i felt the same running out there again			0
i 'm maybe carrying five of six kilos more but it still felt fantastic			0
' but now the club has big problems			2
they need to find a way of solving those			0
' of course i would be interested in the vacancy			2
i stopped playing two years ago			0
now my job is to become a coach			0
' but at this time the road [ to the @entity1 job ] is far away			1
' we can speak but the problem now is that there is not one chairman but five people in control of the club			1
' former fan favourite @entity0 signed for @entity1 when he was just 19 years old under @entity11 in 1997 @entity0 tussles with @entity71 's @entity70 during the @entity73 quarter - final at the @entity74 @entity0 - who was overlooked by @entity75 as they named @entity77 their new boss last week - added : ' i know the club has big problems at this moment but @entity1 is still a big club with a big story behind it			1
' for me it would be a big honour to manage this club and a big opportunity			0
' @entity0 , who also lifted the @entity73 trophy twice while playing for @entity89 , left the @entity91 giants two years before @entity43 arrived in 2000			1
but he was still one of the many former @entity2 favourites who turned out to honour the @entity94 as he battles @entity95			1
it was an emotional day as @entity43 , clearly frail , took the applause of over 41,000 supporters			1
' it was an fantastic atmosphere for @entity43 , ' said @entity0 , 37			1
i have n't seen @entity2 for a long time but sunday was unbelievable			2
' life can be very strange			0
it was very difficult on sunday			0
i saw @entity43 two years ago and he was a different man with no problems			2
now it is hard even to speak to him because he does n't speak very well			0
' he does n't move very well either but that 's okay			0
i think it is good for him to have been here and seen what he means to these fans			0
' for 41,000 supporters to come out only for him is fantastic			0
' @entity111 ( left ) and @entity112 ( right ) in action during the @entity115 match at @entity2 former @entity1 right - back @entity43 , 38 , has been diagnosed with @entity95 and @entity0 believes those same fans will have an important role to play next sunday when the current @entity2 side take on @entity120 in the @entity122 semi-finals			1
large swathes of the @entity1 faithful have boycotted home matches this season as their fall - out with the board continues			1
the @entity129 are the overwhelming favourites to go through but the @entity131 clash is already a sell - out			0
but @entity0 said : ' of course @entity1 have a chance			1
i think the supporters will help the team			0
an @entity138 game in front of 10 or 20,000 supporters is not the same			0
' the best happens when a lot of @entity1 supporters come to the stadium and shout a lot to help the team			2
' @entity0 playing for @entity147 during the @entity115 match at @entity2 on sunday the midfielder says that @entity1 ' fans can play a big part during the club 's next game against @entity120			1

@entity155 would be interested in the @entity1 manager 's post
however , he feels that the club 's off - field *politics* need to be resolved first
several parties , including @entity21 , are *wrestling* for control of the club
@entity0 played for @entity1 between 1997 and 1998
he was back at @entity2 for the @entity43 charity match
