by @entity0 last updated at 5:17 pm on 4th december 2011 a snow shortage across @entity2 which put paid to @entity4 alpine races last week is now threatening to ruin pre-christmas skiing holidays for thousands of @entity6			0
@entity7 across @entity8 and @entity9 have been badly affected by the record - breaking shortages during a week where thousands of @entity6 are preparing for festive getaways			1
this time last year , pistes across @entity8 - where most @entity6 @entity15 sports enthusiasts go - were almost all open			1
barren : the slopes of @entity18 , seen here in these staggering photographs , have been badly affected by the warmest and driest autumn in the @entity21 for 147 years @entity4 alpine races at @entity21 ski resort are scheduled for later this month but could yet be cancelled due to lack of snow but nine out of 12 resorts have currently yet to even start their season			1
these include ones which are particularly popular with the @entity6 , including the @entity29 at @entity30 , @entity31 and @entity32			0
@entity33 , which has almost 100 runs open during the high season , currently has just a dozen open			1
of the 36 resorts on the other side of @entity8 - in the @entity38 - only two , @entity39 and @entity40 , is open			1
it is the same in @entity9 , where canons are working overtime to produce fake snow at @entity44 , where only a handful of runs on two out of five mountains have opened			0
last week the @entity8 resort of @entity18 was forced to abandon the event , due to take place on december 10 and 11 , because of the balmy autumn which has this year beleaguered the continent			1
snow go area : the @entity18 resort in @entity8 has had the @entity4 alpine event taken away from it because it has no snow @entity57 , a spokesman for the resort , which is popular with both @entity60 and chancellor @entity61 , said : ' it was the driest november here for 150 years , since records began			2
' although snowfalls and lower temperatures are expected later this week , a spokesman for weather institute @entity66 said an ' exceptionally warm and extremely dry ' november included temperatures @entity69 above normal			0
this has meant that december - traditionally a busy period on the slopes when many families try and use the holidays to ski and snowboard - could be a wipe out			2
@entity77 joke : just nine out of 12 resorts in @entity8 have currently yet to even start their season			1
with government austerity measures biting in the @entity6 , the @entity8 fear a lack of spare cash will combine with the poor weather to stop people travelling for last - minute breaks too			2
in the meantime , those who have already booked will be checking travel insurance policies to see if they are entitled to compensation because of the lack of snow			0
most policies pay out nominal fee if there is no snow , but only if every ski lift is shut down			2
resorts are known to keep one lift open at all times , no matter how poor the snow cover , to stop this happening			2
some 400,000 @entity6 people travel to @entity8 to ski every season , with 250,000 heading for @entity105 , and 150,000 to @entity106			1
only around 75,000 go to @entity9 , but these tend to be richer holidaymakers , making the market an extremely lucrative one			0
if conditions stay as they are , then many of them are expected to switch to skiing holidays in the @entity112 , where conditions are currently far better than in @entity2			0
despite the gloom , a spokeswoman for the @entity115 , said : ' there is a lack of snow cover lower down in the @entity120 but snow is forecast over the coming weeks and this should dramatically improve conditions			0
slopes which are normally thick with snow at this time of year are currently barren and brown due to the snow shortage			0

just nine out of 12 @entity8 ski resorts open *ahead* of festive season
only two resorts out of 36 are open in @entity8 *pyrenees*
