a @entity1 hospital took the groundbreaking decision to let a dog into the operating theater yesterday as it 's seven - year - old owner underwent life - saving surgery			1
first - grader @entity7 has a rare illness called mastocytosis which causes dangerous allergy - like symptoms - such as hives , swelling , nausea and shortness of breath - to occur without warning			1
her pet terrier , @entity18 , is trained to detect oncoming attacks and on wednesday when she was operated on at the @entity21 the fluffy pooch acted as an ' additional monitor ' for medics			1
resreachers believe that medical response dogs such as @entity18 , can detect subtle changes in body chemistry or behavior in their owner			2
@entity42 , dr. @entity43 , told the @entity44 : ' it was kind of logical , actually			0
knowing what @entity18 could do , we realized that [ she ] was not much different from other monitors we use			2
' ' it sounds silly , in this age of technology but this little dog was more sensitive than all the machines ' while @entity18 could n’t be allowed into a sterile operating room , she could go into a less strict procedure zone			2
she was given a thorough bath on tuesday evening in preparation for her hospital visit			0
the purpose of wednesday 's 45 - minute - long operation was to look for a cause of @entity7 's recurring kidney infections , which , if left untreated , could prove fatal			1
early wednesday , @entity18 followed the youngster into the surgery and sat on the floor next to her bed			1
rare condition : the first - grader has an illness called mastocytosis which causes dangerous allergy - like symptoms - such as hives , swelling , nausea and shortness of breath - to occur without warning @entity79 friend : her pet terrier , @entity18 , is trained to detect oncoming attacks and on wednesday when she was operated on at the @entity21 the fluffy pooch acted as an ' additional monitor ' for medics dr @entity43 says anesthesia can , in rare cases , cause an allergic reaction in patients , so he watched for any signs from @entity18 as the sedative was administered to @entity7			1
though the monitors showed no change in her vital signs , @entity18 got up and turned circles as her body felt the effects of the drug - a minor alert - and then sat back down			1
dr. @entity101 , who performed @entity7 's surgery said the injection of a ' test dye ' during the procedure could have also triggered a reaction			2
but , again , no problems occurred			0
the only other instance @entity18 stirred was as @entity7 was brought out of sedation , and she turned a couple of circles again			1
' knowing what @entity18 the dog could do , we realized that she was not much different from other monitors we use ' ' it was just as we expected , ' @entity116 said			2
' if we had had a script , she followed it to a tee			0
' although service dogs are used in many medical instances , including detecting blood - sugar fluctuations in diabetics and seizures in people with epilepsy , dr @entity43 said he was impressed with @entity18 ’s abilities			2
' it sounds silly , in this age of technology , when we have millions of dollars ’ worth of equipment beeping around me , that we had a little dog who was more sensitive than all the machines , ' he said			0
since @entity18 became @entity7 ’s service dog 18 months ago , she has exceeded the hopes of even her trainer , @entity140 at @entity141 in @entity142			1
ms @entity140 knew it was possible to train a dog to help when a person goes into medical distress but she was n’t sure a dog could learn to alert someone of something happening at a cellular level before the person even shows signs of a problem			0
on standby : the little dog sat on the floor while her owner was operated on @entity156 : @entity7 's mother , @entity157 , says @entity18 makes life a lot easier in 2012 , ms @entity140 trained @entity18 , a who was rescued from an animal shelter , about how to react to @entity7 's condition			1
previously the infant from @entity164 , @entity1 , experienced three to four severe reactions a year but since @entity18 entered her life there has been only one			0
that ’s because @entity18 alerts before the reaction progresses , giving @entity7 ’s parents time to take action			1
her mother , @entity157 , says the dog often senses a problem before @entity7 shows any symptoms or says that she 's feeling unwell			1
' @entity18 has made it possible for us to give out daughter a more normal life ' as well as signaling that there is some wrong , @entity18 can also go to a cabinet at the family ’s home and fetch a kit containing an @entity186 in preparation			0
if the @entity189 ’s are away from home traveling , she knows to go to @entity157 ’s purse and get the kit			0
' @entity18 has made it possible for us to give [ @entity7 ] a more normal life , ' @entity157 said			2
meanwhile her daughter calls @entity18 ' very beautiful and smart ' and at ' the top of my love list			0
' @entity7 is currently recovering from yesterday 's procedure			0
it is very unusual to have a dog present in a hospital operation room			0
indeed , dr. @entity203 , an associate professor of pediatric anesthesiology at @entity204 in @entity1 told @entity205 that he had never heard of such a case .			0
