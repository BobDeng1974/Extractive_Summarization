by @entity0 published : 16:00 est , 13 april 2013 updated : 16:00 est , 13 april 2013 homes are now taking so long to sell in the sluggish housing market that sellers are trying all sorts of ways to move things along			2
some entice buyers by including sit - on mowers in the fixtures and fittings			1
in @entity16 , @entity14 ’s millionaires ’ row , an ocean - going boat was recently thrown into the sale			1
in @entity18 , outside @entity19 in @entity20 , one couple – @entity22 and @entity23 – have gone one stage further			0
the grants have dreamed up a scheme where , if they find buyers for their own @entity29 listed mill house , and those buyers are having trouble selling , they will buy their purchaser ’s home themselves			1
ambitious offer : @entity23 and @entity35 , pictured outside their current home , are offering to ' swap ' their home for a prospective buyer 's it sounds too good to be true but @entity22 , 82 , who spent his working life in the motor trade , has clearly thought through every detail			2
‘ we ’ll give slightly below market value for our buyer ’s house to pay for estate agents ’ fees and to cover the hassle of having to sell the house for them , ’ he explains			2
‘ but what ’s the matter with that ? you would n’t expect to be given the full sale price of a car if you sold it to a garage in a part - exchange deal , so the same should apply to a house			1
’ not surprisingly , there are some limits on the offer : the couple insist that any purchasers ’ home they buy must be in saleable condition – and that it costs less than the mill house			1
priced at £ 910,000 – and divided into two parts – the couple ’s property is no ‘ run - of - the - mill ’ mill house			1
the main section , including six bedrooms , a sitting room , drawing room , dining room and kitchen , is an impressive @entity83 home , with low ceilings , original open fireplaces , cornicing and superb views over the mill stream to the wooded gardens and grounds			1
rural charm : the front of the six - bedroom @entity29 listed home in @entity18 near @entity19 , @entity20 adjoining this part of the house is the second part of the property – what used to be the old mill building			1
this amounts to three rooms of bare space , each 30ft x 17ft , arranged above one another on separate floors			0
@entity22 used the ground floor room as a snooker room and the two others were @entity23 ’s offices and studios			0
although these rooms could be used by a future owner as , say , a gallery space , they are , to be blunt , scruffy			0
@entity23 says : ‘ i can see people ’s faces when i show them around			0
they stand there thinking , “ what on earth can we do with this ? ” ’ the answer , the couple suggest , is to renovate this part of the house into a self - contained home			2
@entity124 , a director at estate agents @entity124 , believes this could be achieved for £ 50,000			2
are n’t the @entity127 taking a bit of a gamble , volunteering to buy a house that is likely to be another ‘ sticker ’ on the market ? traditional interior : one of the bathrooms in the six - bedroom mill house property ‘ we do n’t think so , ’ says @entity23 , 76 , who was a professional ballet dancer in the late fifties before becoming an actress in the @entity138 , once playing opposite @entity139 in a television drama			1
‘ we have money to invest , and interest rates from the banks are so low that in the long term we are better off putting our money into property , thereby killing two birds with one stone			0
’ anyone who suspects that this scheme has come about because the grants are less than financially secure should think again			2
@entity23 recently sold her own business – dealing in the ingredients that make cosmetics – and she did well enough out of it to move into the couple ’s new main home , which is a 15 - acre estate outside @entity159 , complete with pet donkeys , dogs and pigs			0
@entity22 , a successful rally driver in his time , is also comfortably off			0
the couple also have a house in @entity166 and they have no pressing financial need to sell the mill house			1
yet tough business people though they are , it is obvious that the mill house , which they bought 12 years ago , is very special to them			1
‘ we have had some marvellous garden parties here , ’ says @entity22			0
‘ once we had a marquee and it was simply too hot for anyone to stay inside it , so the guests moved under the ancient chestnut tree and dipped their feet in the stream			0
we ’d like others to get similar pleasure out of the old place			0
’ the @entity185 is for sale with www.hobbsparker.co.uk , 01233 502222 and @entity188 , 01227 451123 .			0
