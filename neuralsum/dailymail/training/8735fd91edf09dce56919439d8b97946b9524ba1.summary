by @entity0 published : 18:47 est , 3 february 2013 updated : 13:20 est , 5 february 2013 considering the violent and bloody battlefield death of the monarch it is thought to belong to , this skull seems in remarkably good condition			0
particularly as it is part of a skeleton which has spent more than 500 years beneath what is now a social services office car park			0
but this morning , archaeologists searching for @entity11 ’s remains will release the results of dna tests which are expected to confirm this was indeed the head which once bore the @entity17 crown			1
royal remains ? the skull of the skeleton found in a @entity23 car par. it is thought it could be that of @entity11 violent demise : a painting of @entity11 by an unknown artist from the 16th century			1
he died in battle in 1485 the skull was part of a skeleton – complete with a metal arrowhead embedded in its spine and signs of ‘ battle trauma ’ – which was unearthed by @entity23 archaeologists in september , two weeks after they began excavating the city centre site of the former @entity41 church			1
the last medieval king of @entity17 died at the @entity43 in 1485 , defeated by an army led by @entity45			2
according to historical records , his body was taken 15 miles to @entity23 where it was displayed as proof of his death before being buried in the @entity52 friary			1
when the body was unearthed in the council - owned @entity52 car park , it was discovered the skeleton had a badly curved spine and trauma injuries to the rear of the head consistent with recorded details of both the monarch ’s appearance and 1485 death – prompting those involved in the dig to herald the find as ‘ momentous ’			2
major find ? @entity69 , from the @entity11 society , cleaning a path made from re-used medieval tiles during the excavation of the car park behind council offices in @entity23 tantalisingly , only the front of the skull was visible on the image released by the university yesterday			1
but at today ’s ‘ major announcement ’ , the skeleton is expected to be crowned that of @entity11 dr @entity83 , a lecturer in @entity84 at the university ’s school of @entity87 and @entity88 , who has carried out months of analysis of the remains , said : ‘ the skull was in good condition , although fragile and was able to give us detailed information about this individual			2
‘ it has been ct scanned at high resolution in order to allow us to investigate interesting features in as much detail as possible			0
‘ in order to determine whether this is @entity11 we have built up a biological profile of its characteristics			0
‘ we have also carefully examined the skeleton for traces of a violent death			0
’ it is also expected to be confirmed that the skeleton was buried in neither a shroud nor a coffin which , while unusual for a medieval king , ties in with historical accounts that @entity11 was ‘ irreverently buried ’ by his successor @entity45 as well as comparing dna from the bones with that of a direct descendant of the king ’s sister , @entity122 , they have been subject to carbon dating – which can date bones to between 70 and 100 years – and other studies including environmental analysis			0
@entity129 , deputy registrar of the @entity23 , said the findings could ‘ prove to be one of the biggest archaeological discoveries of recent times ’			2
a documentary on the dig will be shown on @entity136 at 9pm tonight			0
