@entity0 has been keeping busy as recovers from his latest injury setback - by modelling for the @entity3 for @entity5 fashion campaign			1
the @entity7 frontman , who has been on the sidelines since suffering ankle ligament damage during the club 's pre-season tour to @entity12 in july , was on his first assignment since signing for agency @entity14			2
@entity0 was up against 200 other candidates to be the face of the campaign but was the chosen one and showed off a whole new set of skills			1
@entity7 and @entity21 striker @entity0 fronted a campaign for @entity3 for @entity5 @entity0 has yet to play this season and is currently recovering from knee ligament damage in an interview with @entity27 , the @entity21 forward said : ' i obviously had heard of @entity3 but until i walked on set i did n't realise how big this campaign was			1
' i was being told that everyone who was working on the campaign was fashion royalty ; the world 's top stylists , hairdressers and photographers were all there ! ' it was all a bit surreal to be honest			2
the set and location were unbelievable ; i 've done photo shoots for @entity7 and @entity21 before but nothing like this , there were so many different people running around with cameras and tv screens everywhere , it was seriously impressive			0
' @entity0 described his modelling debut as ' surreal ' but expected to be back in front of the camera lens soon @entity0 pictured with fitness coach @entity53 during recovery from his last injury setback @entity0 , seen here scoring against @entity56 at @entity57 , is hoping to regain his place for @entity21 @entity0 , 25 , thought it wise to keep the final set of snaps away from his team - mates			1
' modelling has never been something i have considered , i guess my focus has always been on my football , ' he said			0
' there is plenty of banter that goes on in the dressing room every day , but there are worse things to get stick about than being a model ! ' despite the sucessful debut , @entity0 is not quite planning to follow in the footsteps of @entity78 and launch his own fashion line			2
he added : ' i do n't think i 'm quite ready to take on @entity78 yet			0
i will leave that to him for the time being , i 'm going to concentrate on the day job of scoring goals for @entity7 and hopefully @entity21			0
