@entity0 are staring at a fifth - straight @entity1 last 16 exit following their 3 - 1 first leg defeat at home to @entity5 on wednesday night - a defeat which has brought a dark cloud over the @entity9 ' season			1
with that in mind , @entity10 have @entity0 fan @entity13 of 90min.com to tell us what he makes of the situation			2
let 's see what he had to say			0
after the drubbing @entity0 received at the hands of @entity5 on wednesday , the mood among fans is probably as low as it could be			1
it was not just the manner of the defeat that has hurt @entity9 fans , but the false promise that came before it			0
after the 2 - 0 victory over @entity31 last month , it looked as if @entity0 had finally learned how to handle the big occasion , a view shared by most fans i 've spoken to			1
however , wednesday night showed just how naive and frail this team can be on their day			0
if we 'd have come into the game on the back of defeats and poor form , as we did against @entity43 in 2013 , then the result may have been less humiliating			0
however , sitting third in the league and with some encouraging performances since @entity47 , it was a different scenario altogether and made the whole experience all the more galling to watch			0
@entity49 found it painful viewing as his @entity0 side capitulated 3 - 1 at home to @entity5 on wednesday @entity54 rolled back the years with a glorious finish as @entity5 scored three away goals @entity0 players look dejected during the match as they now face a daunting second leg comeback attempt losing 3 - 1 at home hands the team an enormous task for the second - leg in @entity64			1
a task i do n't see this side capable of completing at this moment in time			0
there were so many shocking displays across the pitch on wednesday night that it will take something truly historic for @entity0 to progress to the next stage			2
according to @entity75 , @entity0 have a 1.5 per cent chance of qualifying for the quarter - finals , and to be honest , that sounds spot on			1
let 's examine how @entity5 have played in @entity81 this season			2
they conceded one goal in six matches in the @entity86 and were only breached last night by a top class @entity89 strike			0
if that is the calibre of goal needed for @entity0 to win in @entity64 , then 1.5 per cent looks generous			2
compact and excellent on the break , @entity5 were set up perfectly			2
their 3 - 1 lead for the return leg also suits them			1
@entity0 will have to attack with numbers and will leave themselves open to the same counter-attacks we saw at the @entity101			2
optimists will point to @entity0 's experiences against @entity43 in 2013 ; where we similarly lost 3 - 1 at home , before narrowly going out on away goals after a 2 - 0 win in @entity107			1
the game in @entity5 is a world away from that tie			2
@entity5 wo n't open up because they are playing at home , like @entity43 did			1
boss @entity112 will have them playing the same system			0
tight , compact and defensively sound			0
@entity89 gave the @entity9 hope when he made the score 2 - 1 late on before @entity5 's third what to say about the manager			1
most of us love @entity49 , but he had the wrong idea straight from selecting his team for this game			0
when will he learn that picking @entity124 and @entity125 in a midfield three is not feasible in @entity81 ? @entity127 should have started alongside @entity128 in midfield , at least giving some sort of base from which to play			1
some @entity0 fans like to get on @entity125 's back because of his style of play , but it 's like @entity49 is putting a square peg in a round hole			1
he is n't the sort of player who will track back and battle for you and everyone knows that			0
@entity145 has also played well of late and it was surprising that @entity49 suddenly thrust @entity147 into the left back slot			1
presumably because he is better going forward			0
it screamed as though @entity49 and @entity0 wanted to put the game to bed at home and have an easy away game , which is ridiculous			1
as a club , we should know by now that the @entity1 is never that simple			0
another season , another disappointment in @entity81 for @entity0			0
@entity125 and @entity124 should n't have started together in midfield for @entity0 on wednesday night for more fan views or to join the conversation visit www.90min.com .			1

@entity0 lost 3 - 1 at home to @entity5 in their @entity1 last 16 tie
@entity49 should n't have started both @entity124 and @entity125
@entity49 should have *dropped* one for @entity127 in midfield
it was a surprise too that @entity145 was *replaced* by @entity147
