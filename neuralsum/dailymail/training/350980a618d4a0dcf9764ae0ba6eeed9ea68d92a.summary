@entity0 , chairman of the @entity1 , has received well over £ 400,000 from green energy firms since 2009 the @entity4 ’s investigation shows how mps , lords and lobbyists who benefit from green policies also advise the government on how those policies ought to operate			1
the result is that the debate over measures of questionable value but enormous cost has been almost silenced			0
only three mps voted against the 2008 @entity17 , whose legally binding emissions targets make it the most radical piece of economic legislation in recent history			0
the present @entity22 – which will increase renewable energy subsidies to new , eyewatering heights – is backed by all the main parties			1
behind this apparent unanimity lies an extraordinary blurring of the boundaries which normally exist between business , politics , academics and campaigners			0
top civil servants frequently work one year for the government and the next for lobbyists , trying to influence their former colleagues			0
mps who play major role in energy debates - but are in the pay of green companies @entity42 has directorships with @entity44 and clean energy firm @entity45 - which he declared			1
but he failed to reveal his role with another green firm , the @entity49 the conflicted @entity51 ... where peers do n't have to state how much they are paid lobbyists who bid for green funds - but advise ministers on green @entity57 of most influential green lobby groups is @entity59 – @entity60			1
its @entity62 branch and its offshoot transform @entity64 first conceived and then successfully lobbied for the @entity65 , now spending £ 3.8 billion of taxpayers ’ money , much of it to fund offshore wind – yet another subsidy on top of the levies on bills			1
its leadership is the @entity75 of ecocrats			0
chief executive @entity77 was responsible for energy in @entity81 ’s @entity80 strategy unit ; at @entity59 he replaced @entity82 , who left to become the @entity64 ’s chief climate negotiator , serving three successive @entity84 , @entity85 and @entity86			1
he is back at @entity59 as a ‘ founding director ’			2
@entity88 , chairman of @entity89 , advises the @entity90 and was a member of the prime minister 's @entity92 until last year			1
he was a member of the commission which set up the @entity65 the specialist green private equity funds ... that are very well connectedspecialist green private equity funds also have a huge web of links			0
for example , @entity88 , chairman of @entity89 , advises the @entity90 and was a member of the prime minister ’s @entity92 until last year			1
he was a member of the commission which set up the @entity65			0
@entity88 is on the board of @entity106 ’s @entity105			0
there his former @entity89 colleague @entity107 directs the @entity109 – an academic project aiming to prove that fossil fuel reserves will have to be left in the ground in order to save the planet , currently a growing demand from green campaigns			2
@entity107 moonlights as head of government advisory – in other words lobbying – at @entity119			0
while he was still at @entity89 , he worked on secondment at @entity121 and as a climate policy adviser for the @entity123			2
the scope of this green elite makes airing objections almost impossible			0
last week , questioned at the @entity127 , even @entity129 and @entity130 secretary @entity128 admitted that @entity64 ’s green policies had increased global co2 emissions – because by increasing the price of energy , they have driven jobs to countries like @entity137 , which use coal heavily and have no binding emissions limits			1
‘ it is certainly arguable that our carbon footprint is bigger , ’ he said			2

@entity0 , chairman of the @entity1 , has received well over £ 400,000 from green energy firms since 2009
@entity148 , **deputy** chief executive of lobby @entity149 , **previously** worked at @entity121 on changes to renewable subsidies **enshrined** in @entity22
@entity0 , chairman of the @entity1 , has received well over £ 400,000 from green energy firms since 2009 .
@entity155 , a @entity85 member of @entity0 ’s committee , has received nearly £ *60,000* since 2008 from @entity157 – an *inter*national** group chaired by @entity158 , who is also chair of the @entity160 ( @entity89 ) . @entity157 campaigns to get *national* *parliaments* to pass green laws .
@entity164 was energy minister until 2012 . he is chairman of @entity165 , which is planning the world ’s biggest offshore *windfarm* . this role was *vacated* by @entity158 when he became chairman of the @entity89 . for this @entity164 is paid £ *48,000* , plus £ *18,000* from @entity170 , which wants to lay a high - *voltage* cable between @entity64 and @entity172 . in all , he is raking in £ *66,000* a year , more than his mp ’s salary .
@entity42 moved the *amendment* to the @entity22 which sought to impose the 2030 carbon limit that will cut co2 emissions from *electric* power by 90 per cent . he has directorships with @entity44 and clean energy firm @entity45 – which he declared . but he failed to reveal his role with another green firm , the @entity49 . this has led to an investigation by the @entity185 . @entity42 also advises @entity89 , one of the biggest green investment firms .
@entity189 of @entity190 is chairman of renewable energy firm @entity191 . together with lord @entity192 and lord @entity193 , he was one of three *co-authors* of a report in may by the @entity196 demanding bigger increases in low - carbon spending who declared **interests** in renewables .
few *environmentalists* have had careers as *prodigious* as @entity59 ’s chairman , @entity205 – inventor of the *slogan* ‘ green growth ’ . having been executive director of @entity210 and director of the @entity212 , he moved into @entity213 , as special adviser to three @entity215 , and then into business , as a green adviser to @entity218 and @entity219 . *remarkably* he is now also the senior climate change adviser to the @entity220 .
@entity223 ’s funders *reflect* its chairman ’s *diverse* **interests** . they include four government *departments* : those for @entity229 , @entity121 and the @entity220 – which means taxpayers are funding a lobby group whose *actions* make them *poorer* . @entity223 also gets money from @entity234 and the @entity235 .
another *powerful* lobby is renewable @entity64 . @entity148 , its **deputy** chief executive , **previously** worked at @entity121 on changes to renewable subsidies **enshrined** in the @entity22 .
