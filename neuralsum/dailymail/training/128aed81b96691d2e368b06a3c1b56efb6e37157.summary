@entity0 watched his @entity2 team come away with the gong after demolishing @entity6 champions @entity4 in an embarrassingly one - sided 2015 @entity7			1
@entity0 's decision to put rugby league before the @entity10 paid off as he watched his beloved @entity2 follow up their 2014 @entity12 title triumph and their recent success in the @entity14 to claim a first world crown with a 39 - 0 rout of @entity17			1
putting @entity18 ahead of the red carpet in @entity20 , @entity0 arrived by helicopter at nearby @entity23 racecourse to join the sell - out crowd of 17,980 and witness a further demonstration of the gulf that remains between the @entity12 and @entity6			0
@entity2 co-owner @entity0 ( right ) chats to @entity27 before kick - off @entity29 is hit hard in a double tackle from @entity31 ( left ) and @entity32 @entity33 can find no way through the @entity2 defence as @entity36 puts in a strong tackle @entity38 's union convert @entity27 , hero of their grand - final success , sat next to the @entity20 actor and director to cheer on his twin brothers @entity43 and @entity27 as the @entity2 became the sixth @entity12 winners of the @entity7 in the last seven years			1
their seven - try triumph also completed a 3 - 0 whitewash of the cream of @entity6 following earlier wins by @entity17 and @entity49 over @entity50 and @entity51 respectively			0
whereas @entity51 and @entity50 at least pushed their opponents all the way , @entity17 were given a rude awakening as @entity2 demonstrated their class from the start			0
@entity58 's men trailed 24 - 0 at half - time and the final score meant a third crushing defeat for @entity17 , who went down 44 - 6 to @entity63 in 2000 and 38 - 0 to @entity64 in 2003			1
just like @entity50 and @entity51 before them , @entity17 conceded early , with former @entity65 forward @entity32 marking his debut with a second - minute try , touching down a grubber kick from the excellent @entity70 , who went on to kick five goals from seven attempts			2
@entity73 is mobbed by his team - mates as the @entity2 back crosses for his side 's fifth try saints tried to rally but were met by a stone wall as the @entity2 demonstrated the smothering defence that is so typical of the @entity12 , whose teams appear determined to prove that every lost cause is one worth retrieving			2
@entity2 illustrated their scrambling defence early on to prevent @entity17 centre @entity84 scoring what looked a certain try while prop @entity29 was also turned on his back over the line			0
the visitors , conversely , were clinical in their execution			0
centre @entity92 turned the @entity17 defence inside out to finish off a break by @entity70 and full - back @entity97 showed his class in taking a return pass from @entity101 to score a third try			2
@entity4 forward @entity103 gets an offload away following a crunching hit from the @entity2 pack @entity106 carries powerfully into the @entity4 defence as the @entity12 champions dominate proceedings @entity0 speaks to the media prior to this side 's 2015 @entity7 clash against @entity4 @entity84 went close again without any joy and there was no way back for the @entity6 champions once winger @entity117 touched down @entity119 's speculative kick on the half - hour mark			1
it was damage limitation when stand - off @entity73 went in for a fifth try six minutes into the second half and @entity2 simply picked off their opponents to add further tries through substitute @entity128 and @entity117 while @entity70 wrapped up the scoring with a meaningless drop goal			1
@entity4 never threw in the towel but the @entity132 had an answer for everything thrown at them as @entity0 began the celebrations and @entity6 went back to the drawing board .			0

@entity4 trailed 24 - 0 at half - time to the @entity12 champions
@entity2 scored tries through @entity32 , @entity92 , @entity97 , @entity117 ( two ) , @entity73 and @entity128
@entity70 kicked five goals from seven attempts for the @entity2 side
@entity38 's union convert @entity27 sat next to @entity0 in the stands
