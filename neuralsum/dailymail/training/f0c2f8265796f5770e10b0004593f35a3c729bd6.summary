@entity1 boss @entity0 feels @entity2 has answered any doubts over whether he can cope with the grittier side of life as a @entity7 footballer			1
@entity2 arrived in the @entity9 game over the summer with a reputation as a player of undoubted talent but also with question marks hanging over him			1
certainly , there was plenty of interest in seeing how the little forward - a product of the @entity19 academy who has also played for @entity21 , @entity22 and @entity23 - would fare having joined the @entity24 , particularly on the less glamorous occasions			1
@entity2 celebrates his goal that saw @entity1 beat @entity27 1 - 0 on @entity28 at a rainy @entity29 @entity2 , though , is emerging as a key man for his new side and he produced a typically influential display in @entity1 's 1 - 0 win at @entity27 on @entity28 amid bitterly cold , soaking wet conditions			1
the 24 - year - old @entity35 proved the match - winner of a physical contest , earning and then converting a 38th - minute penalty			2
and @entity0 said : ' you saw the determination in @entity2 , both in the initial run into the box and then to grab the ball and score the penalty			1
' the @entity27 game was a new experience once again for him and i think he is really enjoying what is happening with his football			2
' it was a cold , wet day , but all that is an old cliche			0
@entity0 insisted that @entity2 has proven he is able to perform even on a cold and wet day ' it is something where if people see any weakness in @entity2 's play or attitude to hard work , they will say he is not quite right for the @entity9 game			1
' i think in the short space of time he has been here , he has knocked all those thoughts on the head because he has come in and shown he is an exceptional professional			0
he works really hard every day to get better and stronger			0
' eleventh - placed @entity1 's next match is a home clash with @entity69 on sunday and @entity0 is hopeful @entity2 , who came off in the second half against @entity27 due to a back problem , will be available			1
a head injury sustained by @entity73 in that game should not stop him from being involved , but @entity75 is a doubt because of the ankle issue that ruled him out of playing at @entity29 , and @entity78 ( knee ) looks set to be absent again			0
a green light is clearly shone on @entity2 as he scores the decisive penalty against @entity27 the @entity24 - now with 51 points for 2014 , their best haul for a calendar year since their promotion to the @entity7 in 2008 - head into the fixture against 15th - placed @entity69 still looking to record back - to - back top - flight victories for the first time this term			1
@entity0 ' men have pulled off some impressive triumphs , beating the likes of @entity95 , @entity96 and @entity97 , but struggled each time to then build upon the result			1
the @entity99 is optimistic that might change following the @entity27 contest as his side prepare to host an @entity69 outfit that have only one win in their last eight league games			0
' we have found it difficult to get back - to - back results - that is something that has stalled our season on occasions , ' @entity0 said			1
' we have had really good performances , then stumbled in the next game			2
so hopefully that wo n't be the case this time			0
' it is difficult for everyone with the quick turnaround , a little bit unfair on everybody really			0
but we 'll make the best of it - we pride ourselves on our fitness levels			0
' the @entity1 manager has been impressed with how the @entity35 has coped with the physicality in @entity9 meanwhile , @entity1 midfielder @entity127 says ' anything could happen ' with regard to his contract situation			2
@entity0 earlier this month said an offer had been made to the @entity132 international , whose current @entity24 deal runs out next summer , before @entity127 himself played down the idea of formal talks having happened			1
the 30 - year - old player has also said he would like to spend the rest of his career at @entity1			2
and , speaking to the club 's website , @entity127 said : ' there 's obviously been one or two things said from both sides , but at the moment anything could happen			0
' i 've got myself back in the team now and my aim is to stay in so i can prove people right and wrong			0
' for me personally , i only have five months left and ideally i want to stay here but if not then i 'm playing to go somewhere else			0
' we will have to see what happens over the coming weeks and months			0
