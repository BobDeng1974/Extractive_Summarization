this morning observers across @entity1 were treated to a rare solar eclipse as the moon passed across the face of the sun and obscured it almost entirely from view			1
but while many , in the @entity10 especially , had to contend with clouds , plenty of images captured the event – and an odd black spot on the sun. while it might have looked like a speck of dust at first , this was actually a sunspot on the solar surface , caused by a concentration of magnetic fields			1
but several observers spotted some strange black dots on the sun ( shown )			1
these were sunspots , caused by concentrations of magnetic fields			1
they are sometimes associated with eruptions such as solar flares sunspots are fairly common , with the number on the surface correlating with how active the sun is			1
they occur when a concentration of magnetic fields causes the surface temperature to reduce , making a specific section stand out from the surroundings			1
they range hugely in size , from just 10 miles ( 16km ) to 100,000 miles ( 160,000km ) - big enough to be seen from @entity46 without a telescope , and more than ten times the size of our planet			1
sunspots are regions where powerful magnetic fields emanate from the sun these magnetic fields can get wound up so tightly that they rise up from inside the @entity56 , and the sunspots mark the points where this happens			1
they are much colder than the rest of the sun 's surface and usually last a few days before disappearing			0
they have a temperature of anywhere from 2,700 to @entity66 ( 4,890 to 7,590 ° f ) , compared to 5,500 ° @entity67 ) for the surrounding solar material , which is why they are so visible			0
sunspots are also sometimes the source of eruptions on the sun , namely solar flares and coronal mass ejections ( @entity77 ) , all of which are linked to magnetic fields			1
the sun goes through a periodic change in activity known as a solar cycle , which has an average duration of 11 years , which also changes the frequency of sunspots			1
sunspots should not be confused with coronal holes , regions of the corona - an aura of plasma around the sun - where the magnetic field reaches out into space rather than looping back down onto the surface			1
sunspots ( previous @entity99 image shown ) are fairly common , with the number on the surface correlating with how active the sun is			2
they occur when a concentration of magnetic fields causes the surface temperature to reduce , making a specific section stand out from the surroundings some observers took to @entity109 to express their views on the sunspots , which were spotted in live footage showing the moon passing across the face of the sun others bemoaned the cloud coverage in the @entity10 , which meant that many observers were unable to actually see the event at all			1
there were more than 10,000 mentions of the eclipse per minute on @entity109 , according to social media monitoring company @entity122 the sun goes through a periodic change in activity known as a solar cycle , which has an average duration of 11 years , which also changes the frequency of sunspots			1
in this @entity99 image , multiple sunspots can be seen across the solar surface this morning , millions across @entity10 stopped to watch the country 's first solar eclipse this century , which plunged parts of the @entity10 in to brief darkness			1
astronomer @entity138 from @entity139 explains : ' when a solar eclipse occurs , what you ’re witnessing is @entity46 , moon and the sun aligning			1
' eclipses can only really happen at a new moon			0
with this in mind , it ’s quite easy to think that we should get an eclipse every month but because the moon ’s orbit around @entity46 is tilted by around five degrees to that of our planet ’s , our natural satellite ’s shadow usually misses the @entity46 ’s surface by passing above or below it			1
' it ’s only really at least twice a year that the geometry lines up just right to make an eclipse for observers in a particular part of the world			2
' the sun is roughly 400 times bigger than the moon but it is also around 400 times further away from us			2
as a result , the sun and the moon have the same size in the sky to make a partial or total eclipse			2
' there are two types of eclipse - a partial and a total			2
during a partial solar eclipse , only some of the sun ’s surface gets blocked out by our lunar companion			1
' with a total eclipse , all of the @entity56 ’s surface gets covered by the moon , creating a shadow that is projected onto @entity46			2
day turns into darkness for a few minutes for observers in this shadow			0
' however , when the moon passes in front of the sun , we do n’t always get a total eclipse			2
' instead , we get an annular eclipse , also known as a ‘ ring of fire ’ - that ’s when the @entity199 is at a further distance from the @entity46 in its orbit and therefore appears smaller , unable to cover the @entity56 ’s disc entirely			2
' at a distance of around 220,000 miles ( 357,000 kilometres ) on 20 march though , the sun ’s disc was sufficiently covered			0
' @entity10 's skies began to darken at around 8.24am this morning as the moon started to move between us and the sun , with the eclipse peaking at around 9.30am across the country			1
the sun 's light was almost totally concealed , casting a huge shadow of the moon across the nation turning day briefly to night , but watchers could not look directly at the sun because they risked damaging their eyes			0
in the @entity218 the sun was practically invisible as the @entity219 experienced a 98 per cent eclipse , while the @entity221 saw a total eclipse			2
but cloud coverage meant that millions across @entity10 were unable to see anything at all of the eclipse , the like of which will not be seen again for several more decades			2
the last solar eclipse of such significance occurred on august 11 1999 , and was ' total ' - with 100 per cent of the sun covered when seen from @entity230			1
another ' deep ' partial eclipse visible in the @entity10 will not occur until august 12 2026 , and the next total eclipse not until september 2090			1
today 's eclipse produced a 100 - mile - wide ' totality ' shadow path that crossed the @entity235 and covers only two land masses , the @entity221 between @entity237 and @entity238 and the @entity240 archipelago of @entity241			0
away from this path the sun was partly obscured			0
a partial eclipse was visible across a large part of the northern hemisphere , including the whole of @entity1 , @entity248 , @entity249 , northern @entity250 and western @entity251			2
more than 100 people flocked to the 5,000 - year - old @entity253 on the @entity219 to witness the solar eclipse			1
and they were rewarded most of the time by a break in the clouds - almost to the point of near totality			0
@entity219 had been billed as the prime place in @entity10 to see the solar phenomenon			2
@entity262 , 58 , and her partner @entity263 , 50 , travelled 905 miles in a 21 hour car and ferry journey - together with their three dogs - to see the event			0
this morning , millions across @entity10 stopped to watch the country 's first solar eclipse this century , which plunged parts of the @entity10 in to brief darkness ' this is the end of the age of @entity275 and we wanted to get here to see the eclipse , ' said mr @entity263 , who works in a fine food business			1
' i took the week off work unpaid and it has been worth it			0
we arrived on tuesday and unfortunately missed the other great astronomical event here this week - the @entity286			0
but the eclipse more than made up for it			0
' ms @entity262 agreed : ' i am a spiritual person and i was drawn here to see the eclipse			0
i believe in powers greater than ourselves			0
' islander @entity293 , 62 , from @entity295 , rang a @entity297 bowl to herald the eclipse as it created dusk - with temperatures noticeably plunging with the sun 's infra red blocked out			0
' the sound resonates with the stones			0
this is a spiritual and sacred place			0
. it is about creating the right harmony , ' she said			0
the sun 's light was almost totally concealed , casting a huge shadow of the moon across the nation turning day briefly to night , but watchers could not look directly at the sun because they risked damaging their eyes			0
instead , solar eclipse glasses ( shown ) helped people observe the event four intrepid shadow seekers even boarded a special boat trip with @entity321 from @entity322 on the @entity323 at 5am to witness the eclipse at remote @entity325			1
the archipelago , 41 miles ( 66km ) west of the main @entity218 , was forecast to be cloud free at the time of the event			0
@entity329 , president of the @entity330 , said it received over 500 inquiries by email - as well as 100 phone calls - from all over the @entity10 as well as far away as @entity335			0
' i was a bit worried when i saw the cloud early this morning but it turned out as good as we could have hoped for			0
it was really memorable , ' he said .			0

people in the @entity10 were treated to a partial solar eclipse this morning
but several observers spotted some strange black dots on the sun
these were sunspots , caused by concentrations of magnetic fields
they are sometimes associated with eruptions such as solar flares
and they can be more than ten times as big as @entity46
