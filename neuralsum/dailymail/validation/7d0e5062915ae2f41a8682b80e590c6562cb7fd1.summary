he has acted opposite @entity1 , tripped the light fantastic on @entity3 and even partied with @entity4 - and now @entity5 is sharing his stories about life during the @entity8 of @entity9			1
the only problem is that @entity5 is a 10 - year - old boy from @entity11 , @entity12 who was born to baptist parents			1
the amazing life he describes belongs to actor and @entity9 agent @entity17			2
@entity5 says it was his past life			2
his vast knowledge , vivid recollections and stunningly accurate descriptions of the era have convinced even experts that the young man may have in fact been reincarnated			0
she says he began having nightmares that neither she or her husband , a local police officer , could find a way to stop			0
he would talk about his heart exploding and , more than anything , @entity9 , a place that was thousands of miles away from @entity12			0
what 's more , the reserved youngster would always speak in a matter - of - fact manner during these times			0
then , after a year of this , he finally sat down his mom			0
' he said " @entity51 , i have something i need to tell you , " ' said @entity38			0
' i used to be somebody else			0
' having been raised @entity30 , @entity38 did not believe in reincarnation or past lives , and decided to hide her son 's admission from his father			2
but she slowly became curious and then somewhat convinced the more her son spoke of @entity9 , his five marriages , lavish trips to @entity64 , his old homes and how all his acting clients kept changing their last names , so she decided to start doing some research on @entity9 during the studio era and shared some of the books she found at the local library with her son			0
then , one day , @entity5 had a breakthrough when he saw a still from the from the 1932 movie @entity34 starring @entity1			2
' that 's me , ' @entity5 told his mother			0
@entity5 began seeing dr. @entity78 ( above ) soon after he revealed his past life , a highly respected child psychiatrist who works with children who remember past lives , and does not think @entity5 is lying @entity5 also recalls parting with @entity4 ( above ) when he was @entity17 @entity5 's father ( center ) is a local police officer and neither her nor his wife knew anything about old @entity9 @entity5 was pointing to an extra in the film , a man with no lines that they later learned was bit - actor - turned - agent @entity17			1
that is when @entity38 decided @entity5 should talk to someone , and the family found dr. @entity78 , a highly respected child psychiatrist from the @entity95 who has spent time talking with and studying children who claim to remember past lives			1
and even he noted there was something very special , and different , about @entity5			0
most remarkable to dr. @entity78 , besides @entity5 's incredible detail , was how accurate his claims matched up with the life of @entity17 , a virtual unknown who neither @entity5 's family nor dr. @entity78 knew anything about , even his name , until they reached out to a film archivist			1
the film archivist gave them the name , and they then contacted one of @entity17 's daughters to ask about his life			1
that is when they discovered that 55 of @entity5 's statements matched up perfectly with @entity17 's life - including the street he lived on , how many children he had , how many siblings he had and those aforementioned five marriages			1
the most shocking claim however came when @entity5 told dr. @entity78 during a session one day that he wondered why @entity129 had him die at 61 - years - old only to be reincarnated as a baby			1
this seemed to clash with @entity17 's death report , that stated he was 59 at the time he died			2
that is until dr. @entity78 looked through old census reports and discovered that the certificate , and not @entity5 , was incorrect			1
the certificate claimed @entity17 was born in 1905 when in fact he had been born in 1903 according to the census			2
and so , @entity17 was likely 61 years old at the time of his death			0
@entity5 now says his memories of @entity17 are starting to fade , and as for dr. @entity78 , he has compiled @entity5 's story and other like it in his book @entity142 .			1

@entity5 , 10 , a boy from @entity11 , @entity12 , with @entity30 parents claims he has been reincarnated and was an actor and agent in a past life
he claimed he was @entity17 , who was in the @entity1 film ' @entity34 ' and performed on @entity36 , after seeing him in a movie still
@entity5 began seeing dr. @entity78 soon after , a highly respected child psychiatrist who works with children who remember past lives
even dr. @entity78 was amazed by @entity5 's story , and found that 55 of his details match perfectly with @entity17 's life
what 's more , @entity17 is such an obscure actor that there were no *articles* of pieces about him at all , and it took a film archivist to even learn his name
@entity5 also knew the year @entity17 was born , even though it was listed incorrectly on his *public* death certificate
