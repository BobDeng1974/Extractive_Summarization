a vaccine found to be 100 % effective in protecting monkeys from @entity2 is to be rushed through human trials - after sitting unused on a lab shelf for ten years			1
the vaccine , known as @entity6 , even had had its results published in a respected journal , and health officials called them exciting			1
however , it then languished on a lab shelf after being licensed to a drug firm - until now			2
a radical 100 % effective vaccine has just beguin human trials at the @entity20 in @entity21 when a person takes a vaccine , it prompts their immune system to start making antibodies			1
antibodies work in our body by finding and then neutralizing foreign objects such as bacteria or viruses			0
the experimental vaccine is based on an animal virus called vesicular stomatitis virus ( @entity6 ) that is combined with a portion of the protein covering of the ebola virus			1
the @entity40 when administered , it induces an immune response against the ebola virus			0
animal studies suggest that the experimental @entity2 vaccine is very effective in helping prevent illness			1
those same studies have shown that the vaccine can help to prevent illness if it is taken immediately after exposure to the ebola virus			1
studies already done in primates found that it prevents infection when given before exposure and increases survival chances when given after exposure			1
the intellectual property rights for the vaccine belong to the @entity59 , and @entity60 , a private company that owns the licensing rights to the vaccine , has the responsibility to produce mass quantities and to bring the vaccine to clinical trials			1
' on october 13 , 2014 , the @entity59 announced the start of clinical trials for the vaccine at the @entity20 in the @entity71 , ' the @entity67 said			1
' these trials will provide critical information about the safety of the vaccine and appropriate dosage			1
' results from the clinical trial are expected in december 2014			2
' @entity79 says at least five clinical trials involving the vaccine , known as @entity6 , will soon be under way in the @entity71 , @entity83 , @entity84 and in an unnamed @entity86 country which is not battling @entity2			1
the work stalled due to a lack on interest in @entity2 , and because there were cases			0
' there 's never been a big market for @entity2 vaccines , ' @entity92 , an @entity2 expert at the @entity93 and one of the developers of the vaccine , told the @entity100			0
' so big pharma , who are they going to sell it to ? ' @entity92 said : ' it takes a crisis sometimes to get people talking			0
we 've got to do something here			0
' the vaccine was produced in @entity111 by the @entity112 , and is the product of more than 10 years of scientific research by @entity112 scientists at the @entity116			0
the @entity118 government patented it , and 800 to 1,000 vials of the vaccine were produced			0
in 2010 , it licensed the vaccine , known as @entity6 , to @entity79 , in @entity124 , @entity125			1
the @entity118 government donated the existing vials to the @entity127 , and safety tests of the vaccine in healthy volunteers have already begun			2
' @entity132 is supplying the vaccine to the @entity127 in its role as the international coordinating body for the @entity2 outbreak , so that the vaccine can be made available as an international resource , ' officials said			2
the @entity2 vaccine on which @entity92 collaborated is made from another virus , vesicular stomatitis virus , which causes a mouth disease in cattle but rarely infects people			0
it had already been used successfully in making other vaccines			0
the researchers altered @entity6 by removing one of its genes — rendering the virus harmless — and inserting a gene from @entity2			2
the transplanted gene forces @entity6 to sprout @entity2 proteins on its surface			2
the proteins can not cause illness , but they provoke an immune response that in monkeys , considered a good surrogate for humans , fought off the disease			0
' @entity127 , in consultation with partners , including the health authorities from the affected countries , will guide and facilitate how the vaccine should be distributed and used			2
' the remaining vials of the vaccine will be kept in @entity118 for further research and compassionate use as required			0
' the @entity2 vaccine on which @entity92 collaborated is made from another virus , vesicular stomatitis virus , which causes a mouth disease in cattle but rarely infects people			0
here , the ebola virus is shown in closeup the research is part of a rush of research to test drugs and vaccines is underway , with clinical trials starting for several candidates , including the vaccine produced nearly a decade ago			1
with no vaccines or proven drugs currently available , the stepped up efforts are a desperate measure to stop a disease that has defied traditional means of containing it .			0

vaccine found to be 100 % effective in protecting monkeys
known as @entity6 - @entity6 health officials called results exciting
vaccine prevents infection when given before exposure and increases survival chances when given after exposure
clinical trials for the vaccine at the @entity20 in @entity21 have now begun
