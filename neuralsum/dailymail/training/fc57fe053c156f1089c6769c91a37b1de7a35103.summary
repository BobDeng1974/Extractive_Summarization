the ' baby gap ' is left after giving birth and is where the stomach muscles have separated approaching the end of my ‘ fourth trimester ’ , i recently decided it was time to try and sort out my stomach			1
feeling brave , i force myself to really examine my new reality			2
once finely honed by @entity10 with definition that i was inordinately proud of , i ’m now left with a jiggling and sagging mess			1
determined to be kind to myself in this process , i shake off my discouragement and head to the gym			2
here ’s what i find when i attempt my first sit up – i ca n’t			2
whereas pre-baby i could do 75 without breaking a sweat , now i ca n’t manage a single one			2
my abdominal muscles are not just weak , post baby and @entity25 – they seem to have disappeared completely			1
and i soon realise i am not alone			2
@entity26 is a @entity27 who has worked with lots of high profile pregnant women – including a famous royal she refuses to talk about			1
she has created a new technique , called the @entity34 , specifically designed to help post-natal women reclaim their abdomen			1
she says , ‘ the @entity34 was developed when i realized how much pelvic floor control and abdominal strength i lost with the birth of my daughter @entity40 two years ago			1
in fact i ’ve named the method after her			2
i have spent my entire life working out and am a former professional dancer , and yet pregnancy affected me far more than i anticipated			2
’ she continues , ‘ in addition to the strain of pregnancy , on top of that , there is the whole process of feeding			2
and like most new mums , i constantly found myself rounded over whilst feeding and holding my baby			1
this throws the back into an awkward position ; straining with the weight of a squirming baby			1
combine this with the natural @entity62 separation of the abdominal wall and loss of pelvic floor stability and like many women , i discovered how easy it is to feel out of control of your own body			1
’ and @entity26 quickly determined that ordinary pilates were just not cutting it			2
' whereas pre-baby i could do 75 sit ups without breaking a sweat , now i ca n't manage a single one , ' says @entity76 ‘ obviously , @entity10 was great keeping me and my clients in shape all the way throughout pregnancy			2
but a vital piece was missing to get back on the road to full recovery			2
what i needed to do was form a clear pattern of exercises that new mothers could do to help this process			0
a lot of mother 's are n't aware that when the stomach muscles separate ( @entity93 ) to make room for the baby that they need encouragement to go back together			1
there are a few simple exercises that with constant use and slow progression can encourage the natural gap that forms in the muscles to close			1
’ i turn up at @entity26 ’s sun filled studio on @entity106 , sceptical but open minded			0
i ’d trained with her before , but never coming from such a place of weakness			0
the first thing she has me do truly startles me			0
the @entity113 method aims to close the ' baby gap ' left in the abdomen by separated muscles she has me lie down and attempt a basic sit up , raising my shoulders just slightly off the matt. then , using gentle pressure she guides my fingers to just below my belly button – and i feel a hollow space			1
i can feel a gaping hole in my abdomen , an actual gap between my muscles that i can feel with my hands			1
‘ that ’s about three fingers worth , ’ she says , ‘ it ’s significant yes , but i ’ve worked with this before			0
do n’t worry , you can do this			0
’ @entity26 says that this ‘ baby gap ’ has to be addressed before you can really kick start your fitness routine			1
‘ the problem i found is that there was no clear way to get from the open gap in the abdominals back to full range of movement without the fear of reoccurrence			1
unless the gap is brought back together , any abdominal twisting movements or movements bringing the feet over the head will cause the stomach muscles to separate again			1
what i ’ve developed is a clear pattern of movement initiating from the closing of the @entity62			0
from there we slowly add on the pelvic floor and postural exercises to bring the body back into full range of movement			0
once the body is back in harmony then we can get back to normal exercise			0
‘ and while i must admit that the yummy mummy tummy tuck has a certain appeal – i ’ve learned it does n’t address the real problems underneath			0
experts i spoke with all agreed that in a tummy tuck , even when the diastasis ( or separation ) is successfully stitched surgically , nothing has been done to change the strength , tone or function of the muscles underneath , which support the stomach and back			1
and while private tuition can be expensive , @entity26 offers a special rate to pregnant and post- natal women			1
she says , ‘ it ’s something i feel passionately about			0
i see so many women who are pregnant or just post baby and i know there are special issues there – and as a new mum myself , who is currently expecting my second baby , i ’m really engaged in this subject			1
there ’s nothing that gives me greater satisfaction than helping a woman during this extraordinary time in their lives			0
’ start lying on your back with your knees bent and your feet hip width apart			0
place your hands on either side of your belly button with your thumbs towards your head and your fingertips towards your toes			0
your fingertips should be at least 4 inches apart			0
as you exhale , slowly pull your navel in towards your spine and push your abdominal muscles together with your hands			1
you can do this exercise very soon after a natural birth			2
adding on once you have mastered the feeling of your abdominals pulling in with your hands trying to encourage the gap to close , add the pelvic floor			1
as you inhale everything is relaxed , as you exhale slowly pull the pelvic floor in and up as the navel pulls down and the hands push the muscles to close			1
repeat 10x @entity228 start in the same position as above with your hands on either side of your belly button			0
as you start your exhale slowly draw the pelvic floor in and abdominals down			0
continue to exhale and fold one knee in towards your chest so that the knee is above the hip bent at a right angle			0
on the next exhale , fold the other knee in towards the chest at a right angle			0
repeat 10x knee opening this time start with the knees and feet together but keep the rest of your positioning the same			0
as you inhale slowly open the right knee out to the side making sure your hips do not move			0
as you exhale , slowly draw the pelvic floor in and the abdominals down			0
continue to exhale and deepen the abdominals pulling down in order to draw the leg back up into center			0
repeat other side and repeat 10x			0
