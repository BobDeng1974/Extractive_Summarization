by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 arsenal do n't deserve @entity2 ... he should play alongside @entity4 @entity5 , @entity6 and @entity7 @entity8 has been a joy to watch and part of me was saddened when he announced his retirement – i was disappointed i would n’t be able to see him play again			0
but i bet deep down he wonders what might have happened had he moved away from @entity16			2
by the turn of the century he had already won everything he could win at @entity16			1
he was winning medals season after season , nobody questioned his greatness			0
retirement : @entity16 legend @entity8 announced his retirement after a 24 - year playing career won it all : @entity8 may wonder what would have happened had he moved away from @entity16 earlier - he had won everything there is to win with the club by the turn of the century only @entity8 could change that but he chose not to			1
was that loyalty ? maybe			0
but it ’s not hard to be loyal to a club paying you handsomely and dominating trophies			0
@entity36 left the comfort zone of @entity38 and won titles for @entity40 and @entity41			1
among the greats who were winning trophies but still chose the brave option and changed clubs and countries are @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 ( both @entity52 and @entity53 versions ) , @entity54 and @entity55			0
move : @entity36 left @entity16 and won league titles with @entity40 and @entity41 winner : @entity8 eventually won 34 major honours with @entity16 , including 13 league titles , the last in 2013 so in his mid- 20s , after creating history and winning the @entity62 with @entity16 , what was stopping @entity8 leaving his legacy and legend status at @entity16 totally intact and moving to another @entity66 giant to do it all again at a different club ? there would have been no shortage of takers			1
i guess the comfort zone is hard to leave			2
and in turn it makes me wonder how @entity8 will be viewed by his new manager @entity75			1
some have suggested the decision to make @entity8 assistant manager was made for @entity79 , rather than instigated by him			1
new boss : @entity75 has made @entity8 his new assistant manager at @entity38 experience : @entity83 ( right ) can draw on more experience than @entity8 having played in five countries the new boss will appreciate the inside information on the club culture at @entity38 i ’m sure			1
but @entity89 had similar input at his disposal and look what happened to him			0
i do n’t think getting the gossip on who @entity8 likes and does n’t like at @entity16 will be high on the new manager ’s list of priorities			1
the real issue is this : can @entity8 have the all - round knowledge and experience to bring much else to the job ? compare his experience with that of @entity79 ’s current assistant with the @entity106 national team			2
transition : @entity8 has made the move to the coaching staff but deciding to stay rather than moving on when he was younger means the @entity111 's place among the very best is in doubt @entity83 played in five different countries , experiencing great success , as well as disappointment			0
i ’m not saying @entity83 was a greater player than @entity8 , but he can draw on a broader football experience in his coaching career			0
@entity8 could have done all that , but he chose not to			0
he will be a @entity16 great , and a @entity120 legend , but his place among the greats of @entity123 is n’t certain .			2

the @entity16 legend might wonder what would have happened had he moved away from @entity38
he had won everything he could with the club - the @entity120 , champions league and @entity131 - by the turn of the century
@entity36 left the comfort zone and won titles with @entity40 and @entity41
@entity75 's decision to name @entity8 as his assistant manager may have been made for him
