a drastic fall in the number of teenage pregnancies is partly the result of youngsters spending much of their time on @entity7 and other social media , experts said yesterday			1
fewer than 30,000 babies were born to girls under 20 in @entity12 and @entity13 last year , official figures showed – down from more than 45,000 in 2006			1
the total is now at its lowest since 1951			0
the figures , from the @entity16 , also showed the average age of a new mother was 30 , up from 29.8 in 2012			1
it is the oldest age of motherhood since such calculations were first made in 1938 , and @entity16 officials said it was certainly the highest ever			2
the spectacular fall in teenage pregnancy does not appear to be connected to @entity27 ’s @entity26 , which concentrated on more sex education and the distribution of condoms the spectacular fall in teenage pregnancy does not appear to be connected to @entity27 ’s @entity26 , which concentrated on more sex education and the distribution of condoms			0
the strategy was halted in 2010 but numbers of babies born to teenagers have dropped by more than a quarter since then			2
analysts suggest that one of the biggest changes in recent years is the rise in social media , which means teenagers are interacting on their phones and computers rather than mixing out on the streets – where they are more likely to indulge in underage sex			1
professor @entity47 of @entity48 said the rise in numbers of girls going into higher education and increasing influence of aspirational immigrant families who discourage single motherhood has also had an impact , as has the morning after pill and new and effective long - term contraception through injections or implants			2
however , he added : ‘ @entity7 use amongst teenagers was just getting off the ground in a significant way in 2007			0
it is hard to deny that social networking applications have changed the way teenagers interact in fundamental ways			0
‘ is it too much of a stretch to suggest that , for at least some teenagers , the amount of time spent interacting virtually with friends on a smartphone has led to fewer physical opportunities to engage in drinking , drugs and underage sex ? ’ the rise among older mothers has also that meant for the first time , more babies were born in 2013 to women over 40 than teenage girls			2
with so many youngsters spending so much time online , they are not finding the time to sleep around older motherhood , the breakdown from the @entity16 said yesterday , follows more women going into higher education and careers , rising costs of having children and housing , and the ‘ instability of partnerships ’			0
the @entity16 count of births in @entity12 and @entity13 last year showed a sharp fall overall in births in 2013 to 698,512 , down 4.3per cent from the 729,674 born in 2012			1
it was the lowest for six years and put the decade - long baby boom into reverse			0
more children born to parents who are married however birthrates among immigrants , who have higher fertility rates than women among the longstanding population , remained high			0
the share of babies born to women who were themselves born outside @entity12 and @entity13 went up , from 25.9 per cent in 2012 , to 26.5 per cent last year .			1

fewer than 30,000 babies were born to under 20s in @entity12 and @entity13 last year

the average age of a new mother was 30 , up from 29.8 in 2012
