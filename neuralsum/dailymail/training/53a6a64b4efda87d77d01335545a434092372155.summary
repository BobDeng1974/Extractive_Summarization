' @entity0 's importance to the @entity9 is hard to overstate			1
he is a former mvp who hold several @entity200 records for rushing			1

his 1,266 rushing yards last season accounted for nearly a quarter of the entire team 's offense			1

but unlike a previous case involving former cornerback @entity218 , the @entity9 have decided to allow @entity0 to return to the field while the legal process unfolds			1
in 2011 , the @entity9 suspended cornerback @entity218 with pay after he was arrested for allegedly assaulting his girlfriend and barred him from all team activities while his trial played out			1
@entity218 wound up missing 10 games and was eventually acquitted			0
he never faced discipline from the @entity200 and played two more seasons with the @entity9 before signing with the 49ers			1
the @entity200 is looking into @entity0 's case , and if convicted he could face a minimum six - game suspension under the league 's new tougher domestic abuse policy that was implemented after commissioner @entity233 admitted he botched @entity216 's initial punishment			1
