a couple have gained thousands of fans after they ' counter-protested ' anti-abortion pickets with bizarre slogans like ' bring back @entity2 ' and ' who farted ? '			1
@entity7 and @entity8 came up with the idea in march to break the ice with pro-lifers outside an abortion clinic near their home in @entity14 , @entity15			1
since then the photographs of their surreal placards have gone viral - prompting dozens of other pro-choice activists to join them every saturday morning			1
others since then have read ' i like turtles ' , ' @entity43 's worst nanny ad ' and ' only racists salt their watermelon '			1
the slogans earn them some bemused reactions from the activists themselves - who perhaps unsurprisingly , have failed to see the funny side			0
' they pray for us , ' mr @entity30 told @entity53			0
' they tell us that @entity55 will destroy the wicked , including us			0
they tell us that we were once sinners just like them			0
' they tell us that we 're angry because we believe in @entity55 so much it hurts us - this one is particularly cute ! mr @entity30 said : ' mostly , they put down their signs and bullhorns and berate us instead of the women ' @entity65 : sometimes the activists appear behind their rival activists to sneak funny photos behind their backs overt : and sometimes , their methods are designed to attract as much attention as is humanly possible ' but mostly , they put down their signs and bullhorns and berate us instead of the women and families going into the clinic for whatever reason they might have			1
' he added : ' that is the goal - to provide a distraction and shield for the people who need the clinic			2
and the ultimate goal is to drive these people away completely			2
' the couple , who met four years ago at a rock concert , began their idea spontaneously when they passed an anti-abortion protest on their way home from a garden centre			2
' we both clinched up a bit , and i said , in an offhand way to @entity8 , ' it would be funny to make a sign that said @entity105 with an arrow and point it at the folks holding babies are murdered here signs ' , he said			1
' i thought she 'd just laugh it off , because i 'm full of silly ideas			0
but she was into it			0
provocative : the couple admitted they had experienced hostile reactions from some of the pro-life activists surreal : to show what they see as the illogical side of pro-life thinking , the picketers make their signs absurd joke : the pro-abortion activists also ca n't help poking fun at the spelling abilities of their rival protesters ' on our way home , we did the deed , post it to our various social media outlets , and people flipped			1
' their protests over one of the nation 's most hotly - contested issues duly made headlines when they posted the images on their blog saturday chores			1
since then the images have been shared thousands of times , and earned them some heavy flak from pro-life advocates who say they are trivialising an important debate			1
but mr @entity30 said : ' there are things that need protesting in this world , and we 're not always sure how to protest them			2
' by adding humor , we 've refused to have an argument with the pro-life movement , because we know that argument will not be won			0
the argument must be changed			0
bemused : the slogans are deliberately designed to be as ludicrously inappropriate as possible positive note : the couple said they wanted to combat protesters with chirpy and irreverant messages serious : there are also more earnest messages too after dozens of people began joining the couple ' this is a conversation about equality and freedom			1
' anti-abortion protests are widespread and earned a big boost in june , when the @entity174 said a ' buffer zone ' stopping activists from getting to close to clinics violated free speech			2
the justices struck down the 35ft zones in @entity181 saying they was too sweeping , taking in sidewalks which have been a place for political campaigning for hundreds of years			0
to date the couple have only picketed the same protesters at a single clinic less than 10 miles from their home , the @entity189 ( @entity190 ) in @entity14			1
if they manage to evict the protesters out of embarrassment or simply annoyance , they claim they will move on to the next clinic			0
support : nowadays , the couple are far from alone in their comedic saturday morning vigils in @entity15 catchy : the idea has been taken up in @entity200 , where a copycat protest was held last week ( pictured ) but some allies are way ahead of them - as a copycat ' counter-protest ' sprang up in @entity200 last week			1
and the couple have no plans to scale down their operation			0
' the goal has never been to go viral , to be some cute @entity210 couple or whatnot , ' mr @entity30 said			0
' the goal has been and remains to shame people who feel like shaming women and families exercising their legal right and to distract them from shaming those people			2

@entity218 , 31 , and wife @entity8 began their protests in march
signs point at pro-lifers declaring ' he 's single ' and ' honk if you 're horny '
more surreal ones say ' bring back @entity229 ' , ' @entity227 slays ' and ' @entity230 '
thousands of people have shared the images since they were put online
dozens join protests @entity14 , @entity15 , as they spread to west coast
