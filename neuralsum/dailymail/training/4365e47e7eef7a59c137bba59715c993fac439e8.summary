the international development secretary said it was sensible for @entity5 to invest in satellites it could use to check the weather and help its agriculture - based economy			2
critics will point out that it is possible to track the weather using a range of meteorological websites , not least the @entity19			0
@entity1 yesterday defended giving vast amounts of taxpayers ' cash to @entity5 while the oil - rich country is pouring money into its own space programme @entity5 , which has set in train ambitious plans to launch its own rockets and even put a man in space , has accepted £ 300million in @entity31 aid this year alone and taxpayers are sending £ 1.14billion over the five years of the @entity33			1
the cash is being sent even though the country has enough money to fund the first @entity5 astronauts who are being trained to join @entity39 , @entity40 or @entity41 missions within the next two years			1
some have asked why @entity31 is , in effect , subsidising a space programme for a nation where 70 per cent of people live below the poverty line			1
but miss @entity1 insisted that @entity31 ’s aid would ‘ help @entity5 progress and develop as a country ’			1
she told @entity51 : ‘ i believe it is being well spent but we obviously have to make sure that we critically assess the projects under way			0
‘ we do expect them to invest in their country as well			0
the so - called space programme was in fact investment in satellites , weather satellites and for communication			1
‘ so actually this investment that they ’re making in the so called “ space programme ” which is actually satellite technology , some of which actually has been provided by @entity31 companies based in @entity71 , is a sensible investment and actually one that we would be expecting them to be making alongside the investment that we make			1
’ @entity5 ’s space programme started in 2003 but its first satellite lost power and disappeared from orbit			1
it now has three in space			0
a @entity39 rocket of the type used by @entity5 to launch satellites although it has bought satellites and launched them on @entity39 rockets , @entity5 has built laboratories which it hopes will produce its own spacecraft by 2028			0
the country ’s @entity84 has confirmed @entity5 astronauts should be trained and ready for space travel within two years			2
the agency ’s director general , professor @entity88 , said last month : ‘ by our road map we are supposed to have astronauts prepared by 2015			0
‘ before the end of the year , the recruitment of astronauts will begin so that we have them handy and as soon as we get the nod we can pick from that number			0
’ the £ 1.14billion @entity5 is receiving over five years is more than double the £ 500million set aside to prop up struggling accident and emergency departments at our own hospitals			2
@entity102 , chief executive of the @entity103 ’ @entity101 , said : ‘ the @entity5 authorities have been quite clear that they are working towards sending their own astronauts into space within a couple of years , so @entity1 can not bat away the public ’s concerns with talk about weather satellites			1
‘ questions still remain as to why @entity31 taxpayers should be expected to subsidise this advanced technology when the @entity5 government is not ensuring that some of its citizens ’ most basic needs are met			2
’ miss @entity1 received strong backing from @entity120			0
the prime minister ’s official spokesman said : ‘ these satellites are designed to supply better information about weather and climate which for a country so dependent on agriculture is hugely important			0
‘ there are a number of programmes operating in that country , but fundamentally the point that the international development secretary was making this morning is that it will aid the growth of the economy and will help the country provide more food			0
