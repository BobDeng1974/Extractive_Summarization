the @entity1 , @entity2 and @entity3 foundation released a wide - ranging report on monday declaring that the world 's ' pace of change ' on the rights of women and girls ' has been far too slow			1
but the report , called ' @entity12 , ' comes at a time when the foundation is under fire for accepting large cash infusions from countries that the @entity17 has accused of discriminating against women and committing other human rights abuses			2
those nations include @entity21 , the @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity24 , @entity25 , @entity26 and @entity27			1
former president @entity54 defended the foundation 's work saturday in @entity57 , saying that millions of dollars from the @entity22 and the @entity21 in particular had no impact on its work			1
' do we agree with everything they do ? ' @entity54 asked , ' no. ' ' you ’ve got to decide when you do this work whether it will do more good than harm if someone helps you from another country			0
' the report , issued simultaneously in @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 and @entity74 , is a 46 - page update on progress made globally since @entity2 a 1995 @entity78 conference held in @entity79 declared : ' women ’s rights are human rights and human rights are women ’s rights			1
' the foundation released its report a day after @entity90 , an annual march 8 observance that was shortened this year in the @entity87 with the beginning of @entity89			2
the symbolism of a shortchanged 23 - hour @entity87 observance seemed tailor - made for the report 's wordy scolding			2
' security is tenuous for women and girls , even in their own homes , ' the @entity36 writes in ' @entity12			1
' ' critical barriers – including legal restrictions and limited access to resources – undermine women ’s economic opportunities			0
' ' and women ’s voices are still underrepresented in leadership positions – from legislatures to boardrooms , from peace negotiations to the media , ' the report reads			1
the report is long on one - two punches , acknowledging some progress on specific issues but insisting that it 's unsatisfactory			0
' today , more than four out of five [ national ] constitutions have some mechanism to guarantee gender equality , ' the foundation says , ' but rights on paper often go unenforced – and many legal barriers remain			0
' ' globally , women and girls are living longer and healthier lives , and the rate of maternal mortality has nearly halved , ' but ' women and girls in certain regions and communities confront high rates of @entity134 , poor care during pregnancy and childbirth , and limited access to family planning			2
' and while ' many significant gender gaps in education have closed , ' the report reads , ' gaps remain and marginalized girls lag farthest behind			1
' ' poor , rural , minority , and conflict - affected girls are significantly less likely to be educated , ' the authors write			1
the ' @entity149 ' report , issued march 9 , 2015 , traces the global progress of women since a 1995 @entity78 conference in @entity79 the foundation 's partners on the ' @entity12 ' project include the @entity156 , the @entity157 , @entity158 and @entity159			1
mrs. @entity3 , a former secretary of state , @entity160 and first lady , is touting the report at a politicall vulnerable time			0
last week the @entity46 revealed that throughout her tenure as @entity87 's top diplomat she used only a self - hosted private email address			0
that has already brought talk of subpoenas from congressional @entity170 and led some groups in @entity172 to reconsider whether the government 's responses to past @entity176 requests could possibly have been complete since @entity54 's emails were not turned over to @entity17 until last last year			0
@entity178 , presdient of @entity180 , told @entity181 that his froup has already file nine new @entity176 requests related to @entity54 since the email news story broke			0
' and there are a few others we may seek to reopen , ' @entity178 said , ' because they led us to believe they had searched her emails			0
' ' but obviously that has n't been done			0
' @entity180 said as many as 160 of its past @entity176 requests against the federal government could be affected , along with 20 past and present lawsuits .			2

@entity21 , the @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity24 , @entity25 , @entity26 and @entity27 have donated *heavily* to the @entity36
' @entity149 ' report *praises* some progressin in the past 20 years but demands more rights from women and girls
worldwide , ' security is tenuous for women and girls , even in their own homes , ' the 46 - page report reads
' poor , rural , minority , and conflict - affected girls are significantly less likely to be educated , ' the foundation says
