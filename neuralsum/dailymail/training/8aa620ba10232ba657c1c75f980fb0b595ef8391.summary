by @entity0 published : 07:22 est , 15 january 2014 updated : 12:21 est , 15 january 2014 a couple who appeared on @entity4 's @entity3 to discuss the fact they drink their own urine have become the subject of a @entity10 backlash from horrified viewers			1
@entity12 and @entity13 say their own home brewed elixir has banished symptoms of depression , made their eyes brighter and their skin clearer			1
the couple , who have been dating for two years , told an aghast @entity22 and @entity23 on @entity4 's @entity3 that their urine was so potent it was ' like an energy drink '			1
@entity26 : @entity12 and @entity13 say their own home brewed elixir has banished symptoms of depression , made their eyes brighter and their skin clearer home brew : the couple , who have been dating for two years , told an aghast @entity22 and @entity23 on @entity4 's @entity3 that their urine was so potent it was ' like an energy drink ' they also admitted to dabbing it on cuts and burns to help them heal			1
at one point they even downed a champagne flute of the liquid live on air , as @entity22 shielded her eyes with her hands			2
but viewers took to @entity10 to complain that the segment - aired at 10.50am - was too much for morning tv			1
one wrote : ' stomach is churning			2
just watched people drink their own urine on this morning			2
' another said : ' do you chill it or drink it straight from the tap ? ? " straight from the tap " @ itvthismorning what am i watching ? another added : ' can not believe i have just watched a segment on this morning about people drinking there own wee			1
what goes on in some people 's minds ? ' disgusted : some repulsed viewers took to @entity10 to complain the piece was ' too much ' for morning tv , after @entity72 asked if they drank the liquid ' warm or chilled ' mr @entity13 explained that he has been drinking a cup or two of his own urine every day for seven years after a friend extolled the virtues of it			1
when he met miss long two years ago , he introduced her to it - and after finding it relived symptoms of her depression , she has continued with it			1
the couple now firmly believe the practice is a key part of staying healthy			2
mr @entity13 told the programme that he 'd started drinking his own urine seven years ago after being ' a naughty kid ' - and noticed the difference straight away			1
he said : ' i found it balanced my head , things were calmer and i could think clearer			0
' miss @entity12 added that when she met him she 'd suffered from depression for 10 years and was taking medication for it			1
wanting to come off the tablets , mr @entity13 told her about the health benefits he 'd discovered from drinking his own urine every day			1
happy : mr @entity13 explained he has been drinking a cup or two his own urine every day for seven years after a friend extolled the virtues of it doing it together : when mr @entity13 met miss long two years ago , he introduced her to ' urine therapy ' - and after finding it relived symptoms of her depression , has continued with it she said : ' i spoke to people where @entity13 works and heard stories about how they had got better [ from doing it ] and thought i would try it			1
' for the first couple of months i felt happy and bouncy - it worked straight away , ' she added			2
' if i had forgotten to take a tablet then i would do that instead			0
' she added that the taste and smell of the urine ' depends on what you 've been eating and drinking ' - and that it ' definitely was n't an acquired taste '			1
mr @entity13 added : ' it smells and tastes like wee - there 's not getting around it			2
but it cleans you out			0
' when you carry on doing it , you can taste what food you eat			0
' this was backed up further after the couple knocked back a shot of their urine live on air - with mr @entity13 declaring he could ' taste the coffee ' he had just drunk			1
caution : but dr @entity142 ( right ) warned that ' urine is one of the body 's ways of getting rid of stuff - and it could contain toxic byproducts ' and when quizzed by an incredulous @entity22 , the couple admitted they tended not to sip the first ' go ' of the day , due to it being ' quite strong '			2
and dr @entity142 cautioned against the practice			0
he warned : ' it 's not necessarily recommended			0
if you are on medication and you are going to come off it , then it 's important to talk to a doctor first			0
' urine is one of the body 's ways of getting rid of stuff - and it could contain toxic byproducts			2
' yes , it is sterile in the bladder , but once it leaves the bladder it can come into contact with bacteria			0
if you drink it , you are re-introducing that bacteria back into the body			0
urine therapy is said to date back to the @entity173			0
historical documents suggest that the @entity175 disinfected wounds with it , while the benefits are also mentioned in @entity180 and @entity181 literature			0
urine is highly sterile , consisting of 95 per cent water and five per cent nutrients such as proteins , vitamins and minerals			0
during the digestive process , the liver deals with toxins and removes them to be excreted			0
the blood then goes to the kidneys where it is filtered again and extraneous components the body no longer needs are collected in a sterile solution which is then passed as urine			0
but gp dr @entity200 said : ' over the years many people have claimed health benefits from drinking their own urine , but as far as i 'm aware there is no scientific evidence to back - up these claims			1
' the kidneys are an efficient filtering system getting rid of what the body does n't need , so to put this back into the body seems counter-productive			0
' personally , i believe there are better - and more palatable - ways to keep the body healthy including not smoking , eating a healthy diet , and keeping stress under control			0

some described the segment - aired at 10.50am - as ' stomach churning '
