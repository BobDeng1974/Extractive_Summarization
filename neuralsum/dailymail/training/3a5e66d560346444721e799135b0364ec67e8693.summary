by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 is talking about positioning			1
more specifically , about getting into better positions more often to score more goals			2
it is a part of his game he would like to improve and what , you might ask , is so unusual about that when this is a player already reflecting on so many goals for @entity14 ? well it ’s the fact that this is the same player managers once regarded as a left back			1
a player , it is worth reminding ourselves , who once had to battle with @entity21 for a place in the @entity24 team			2

since arriving in @entity48 he has been christened ‘ @entity53 ’ , and it is a nickname that captures the sometimes spectacular nature of his goals			2
but to this observer none has been more spectacular than his 20th of the season ; the goal that secured the @entity33 against @entity34			2
we knew @entity2 was quick			1
but it is hard to recall a more impressive demonstration of pure pace on any pitch than the burst he mustered to take him past @entity65 after the @entity34 defender had knocked him into touch			0
that goal is seen as the defining moment of @entity2 ’s first season abroad			1
‘ i scored a similar goal for @entity75 maybe six weeks beforehand , ’ said @entity2 , who was speaking at an @entity73 @entity72 event			1

whether the finest player in @entity107 football could exist in harmony with the finest player in the world			0

i ’ve learned a bit of everything from him			0
the way he plays and gets himself into certain positions ; it ’s a chance to learn off one of the best players in the world			0
hopefully , that will improve me as a player			0
’ it is at this juncture that he mentions that area where he feels he needs to improve — scoring goals			0
‘ i do n’t think there ’s anything specific , ’ he said			0
‘ it is more my all - round game , positioning-wise			2
i need to get myself into more goal - scoring positions			2
