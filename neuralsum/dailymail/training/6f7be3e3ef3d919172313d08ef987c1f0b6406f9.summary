by @entity1 reporter published : 11:34 est , 29 march 2013 updated : 20:29 est , 29 march 2013 fraudsters : @entity3 , 26 , would write brazen character references for girlfriend @entity5 , 36 , while she would claim to be an experienced health care assistant			1
in fact , her only qualification was in yoga a couple forged each other ’s references to land jobs in hospitals – then claimed thousands in sick pay when one pretended to be too stressed to work			1
fraudsters @entity5 - @entity5 and @entity19 put patients at risk when they conned their way into care jobs across the south of @entity25 without the right qualifications			1
the scam was only uncovered when @entity5 , 36 , applied for a third job while still off with ‘ stress and anxiety ’ from two other posts			1
health bosses became suspicious and launched an investigation and the pair , from @entity35 , were arrested			2
yesterday they were jailed after a court heard how the only qualifications @entity5 possessed came from a yoga school			1
@entity3 , 26 , sobbed as he was handed a 12 - month prison sentence for fraud			2
his crimes breached a suspended sentence he was given for stealing from a former employer in 2011			0
@entity5 , 36 , also wept as she was given eight months in prison , suspended for 18 months , as well as 100 hours ’ unpaid work			1
sentencing them , the judge , recorder @entity46 , said the pair had worked together to expose patients to ‘ the potential of risk ’			0
@entity54 @entity53 heard how @entity5 had gone home with ‘ stress and anxiety ’ just two days after starting at @entity58 in @entity59 – where staff had already noticed she lacked key skills for her health care assistant post			1
during the subsequent three months off she claimed more than £ 2,300 in wages – and even asked for extra hardship payments			2
in the meantime , boyfriend @entity3 wrote a reference claiming to be her ex-boss so she could secure more work with the @entity70			0
but again @entity5 went off sick within days of starting , the court heard			1
while absent she tried to land a third job at a hospital in @entity75 but was unsuccessful			0
brazen : the couple were so confident in their deceit that @entity5 attended just her first two days of a job at @entity58 , near @entity54 , before going off sick with ' stress ' for three months the fraudsters used @entity5 ’s mother as a reference by altering her surname and creating a fake email address and contact details			1
@entity5 also lied about studying at the @entity88 and @entity89 – when her only qualifications actually came from the @entity91 of yoga			2
@entity3 , who had been sacked for poor performance and attendance at another @entity70 , made a series of job applications			0
six failed to get him a post at the @entity98 in @entity99 , but one led to employment with a hospital in @entity75			0
however , @entity5 had lied in his reference that she had once been @entity3 ’s supervisor as head matron at the @entity99 hospital and the con was uncovered when health bosses decided to investigate the spurious job application			1
the pair pleaded guilty in february to a string of fraud charges			0
@entity3 , who had depression , was said to have had a ‘ traumatic upbringing ’ and put on seven stone in weight while the swindle was being investigated			0
the couple had also suffered financial difficulties			0
@entity3 took out a mortgage of £ 130,000 on a £ 136,000 home in 2006 only for the pair to be evicted in january after the property ’s value plummeted			0
@entity5 said she was ‘ ashamed ’ of her behaviour .			2

@entity5 - @entity5 , 36 , and @entity19 , 26 , jailed for 8 and 12 months
their scam involved faking *documents* to get jobs then taking paid sick leave
caught after @entity5 applied for job while off with ' stress ' at two other posts
she attended two days at @entity136 , @entity54 , before calling sick
claimed to be expert health worker , but only real qualification was in yoga
