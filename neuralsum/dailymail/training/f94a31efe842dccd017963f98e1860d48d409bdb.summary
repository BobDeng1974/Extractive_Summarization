for several long minutes at the end the boy wonder of @entity1 2014 stood alone in the middle of the mighty @entity4 , looking up at his own face staring back at him from a giant screen , taking it all in			1
@entity9 had scored twice to send himself soaring to the top of this @entity12 ’s goal charts			1
step down a rung @entity13 and @entity14			0
the first , that exocet volley on the turn from well outside the box after chesting the ball down , has to be the most magnificent of all here so far			0
stand down a notch @entity21 and @entity22			0
scroll down to see highlights of @entity24 unstoppable : @entity9 scored the tournament 's best goal as @entity24 beat @entity27 next big thing : @entity9 is top of the @entity12 scoring charts with five goals the second ensured that @entity27 went home unlamented in the lurid wake of @entity34			1
it also made certain that @entity39 and the rest of the boys from @entity43 dance on - some celebration that disco jig of theirs by the way - to a quarter final against @entity1			1
@entity24 have put a smile as wide the @entity46 on the face of this football spectacular			1
although when the pulses stops racing and the cheers die down you are left to examine the reality			0
the starting point for putting this gem of a team from emerald city into perspective is @entity60			0
had @entity61 , @entity62 come through to the @entity4 on saturday night instead of @entity27 the high probability is that they would not just have been beaten but horribly embarrassed by @entity24 ’s @entity66 skills			1
@entity67 : @entity24 - highlights on target : @entity9 scores his second goal in the 2 - 0 defeat of @entity27 sunshine boys : @entity24 's skills and personality have made them a favourite for neutrals and although football is not an exact science of comparison , it is just as likely that had @entity82 ’s team been required to face the @entity84 who went so agonisingly close to ending the @entity87 dream , then they would have been despatched as readily as @entity88			1
world class : @entity9 has scored the best goal of the @entity12 so far the logicial analysis is that @entity60 were the weakest link in an unexpectedly poor group			1
so while we relish the ball - juggling delights and youthful exuberance of @entity24 , their excursion to @entity96 on friday may be as far as they go			2
@entity1 are not setting their homeland alight as of yet but they were marginally better than @entity105 and withstood the enormous pressure of that penalty shoot - out to keep the @entity12 alive and the socio - economic protesters on the back burner			1
do not expect @entity24 to give them quite such a torrid time			2
as the modern game ’s heirs to the good old - fashioned ball dribblers of yesteryear they are a handful for anyone			0
but they are not possessed of the slick , angled running without possession which is at the crux of that bewildering one - touch inter-passing , the hall - mark of the best teams in this tournament			0
@entity24 are a collection of richly talented individuals , each of whom is eager for the most part to try to win games on his own			2
they did combine together brilliantly to create @entity9 ’s second goal but such collaboration is not their stock in trade			2
of all possible opponents in the last eight , @entity1 have to be the most daunting for @entity24			1
not only because they the favourites and have home advantage but because they grew up among ball jugglers like these and consequently understand how to cope with them better than any other football nation			0
still , it will be fun watching @entity24 carry it to them			0
@entity150 : @entity24 v @entity105 @entity151 ask : @entity24 face a tough challenge of beating @entity1 in their home country rodriquez the 22 - year - old prodigy is but one of half a dozen players capable of running any defender ragged			1
@entity159 , @entity160 , @entity161 and full backs @entity158 and @entity163 also gave @entity27 fits			0
but they play a game to which @entity1 are long accustomed and onto which big @entity166 has soldered on some contemporary , steel - tipped organisation			2
@entity9 has arrived today and is a stellar prospect for a glittering future			0
whether or not tomorrow can come as quickly as this friday , we should all enjoy @entity24 while we can			0
