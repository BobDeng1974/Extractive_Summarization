chairman of the @entity18 , @entity17 , had guests in stitches as he described the photograph of the heir to the throne as being ' quite buff ' during his own diving days			1
ever helpful , @entity0 , 32 , leaned over and explained it to his father who raised his eyebrows theatrically , only to be told : ' @entity43 , you should be pleased ! ' by a laughing @entity45			2
@entity15 did see the funny side , quipping ' i know my eldest will now demonstrate his buff credentials ' during his own address			1

@entity15 also recalled how he had been ' absolutely terrified ' when he divided in the @entity75 and and how once , when a @entity76 , came out of the gloom and put its teeth on his mask he ' shot off like a @entity81 missile '			2
' i hope one day my son , @entity82 , might follow in our footsteps , ' said @entity0 during his own speech			2
' at the moment bath time is quite painful but hopefully donning a snorkel and mask might calm him down			0
' @entity0 then donned a wet suit and got into the outdoor pool - despite earlier admitting he was something of a ' fair weather diver ' - and tried his hand at snorkelling with a group of eight - year - olds			2
the prince slipped easily into the water as he chatted with the youngsters about their own diving experiences			0
he was then challenged to a race - but let the others win			0
then it was time to put on his own , borrowed , mask and tank and get under the water			0

it is one of the most exciting sports you can be involved in			0
' @entity17 , chairman of the @entity18 which has 30,000 members countrywide , said it was an honour to welcome @entity0 as the third generation of his family to become president			1
' we look forward to working closely with @entity160 to inspire a new generation of young scuba divers and snorkellers to discover the rich adventure and opportunities of the underwater world which we all have a shared interest in preserving and protecting , ' he said			0
