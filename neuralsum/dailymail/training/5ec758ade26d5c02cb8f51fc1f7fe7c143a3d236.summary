it may be known as the red planet , but sunsets on @entity3 are blue			1
@entity4 has released a new video on the social media site @entity7 showing the sun dipping towards the @entity3 horizon , captured by its exploratory rover opportunity			1
the time - lapse video of the eerie sunset was created by piecing together images taken by @entity10			0
the images show a darker , dustier sky than here on @entity17 that perhaps loses some of the romance that often accompanies sunset on our own planet			0
two strange , cloud - like plumes reaching high above the surface of @entity3 have created a stir among scientists			1
the plumes were seen rising to altitudes of over 155 miles ( 250 km ) above the same region of @entity3 , and could help explain what makes up the @entity3 atmosphere			2
it is thought that they could be made of particles of water or carbon dioxide or perhaps an aurora shimmering above the poles			0
past surveillance by scientific orbiters have suggested @entity40 to have a ' strip ' with a strong but localised magnetic field			0
if this is the case , the @entity3 ' aurora ' would be a remarkable 1,000 times brighter than its equivalent on @entity17			0
but ' both explanations defy our current understanding of @entity3 ' upper atmosphere ' , scientists admit			1
and rather than turning the sky a deep orange , as happens on @entity17 , the setting sun gives the sky a deep blue tinge			2
although much of the surface of @entity3 is a deep red colour , it is this thick dust that also turns the sunset blue			1
however , dr @entity60 , a planetary scientist at the @entity61 who studies @entity3 , warned that the cameras on the @entity10 may not be conveying the true image			0
he said : ' we do have to be a little careful with the colour produced by the cameras on this rover as they are a false colour image			0
' what is very striking though is how much smaller the sun appears compared to here on @entity17			0
' taking images like this can teach us a great deal about the atmosphere on @entity3			2
' most of the dust is in the troposphere , which is about 40km up on @entity3			0
' there is a lot of effort to find out how high up dust clouds can get up on @entity3 - particularly after some cloud - like plumes were spotted that appear to be much higher in the atmosphere than we thought dust can go			2
' the sun appears just five eighths of the size it does on @entity17 when viewed from @entity3 while thick dust in the atmosphere filters out the red light from the sun , giving sunsets a deep blue colour , as pictured above scientists say sunset on @entity3 would have a blue light , however , as the red dust in the atmosphere filters out much of the red light from the sun. as the sun dips lower in the sky , its light has to travel through the lower layers of the atmosphere where the dust is thicker			1
on @entity17 our own atmosphere scatters blue light creating the red and orange shades that light up the sky at sun down			1
it is not the first time @entity4 has shown the world what a sunset on @entity3 would look like and it released a longer video in 2010			1
opportunity has seen around 3940 sunsets since it arrived on @entity3			2
scientists use the cameras of the @entity10 , shown above in an artists impression , to study the sunsets on the red planet to help them quantify how much ice and dust is in the atmosphere of the red planet from the surface of the red planet the sun appears about five eighths of the size it is when seen from the @entity17			1
the red planet receives just 40 per cent of the light we experience on @entity17 , meaning the sky appears much darker as the sun begins to fall towards the horizon			0
however , twilight can continue for up to two hours after the sun has set - far longer than on @entity17 - as sunlight is scattered around to the night side of the planet by the abundance of dust high in the atmosphere			1
the average length of a day on @entity3 is about 24 hours and 37 minutes			0
scientists running the mars rovers take occassional images of the @entity3 sunset to help them determine how high into the atmosphere the @entity3 dust billows			1
they low angle of the light also makes it easier for them to see ice clouds that can form in the sky			0
at 141,610,000 miles from the sun , the average temperature on the surface of @entity3 is around -66 ° c ( -87 ° f )			2
@entity4 's opportunity rover has traveled close to the same distance as an @entity168 marathon during its mission as can be seen in the image above which charts its path across the @entity3 surface over the past 11 years			1

@entity4 's opportunity rover captured the sunset from the surface of @entity3
dust in the atmosphere scatters red light making the sunset appear blue
the effect produces an eerie yet *beautiful* *contrast* to the orange *landscape*
twilight on @entity3 can continue for up to two hours after the sun has set
opportunity has experienced *3,940* sunsets during its mission to @entity3
scientists use the @entity3 sunsets to study dust and ice in the atmosphere
