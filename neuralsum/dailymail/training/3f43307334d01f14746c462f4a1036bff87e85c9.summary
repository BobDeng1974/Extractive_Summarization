increase : the government plans to ban multi-buy deals in a bid to stamp out binge - drinking ( file picture ) industry experts say the increase represents an overnight increase in the price of drinks equal to the inflationary increase in costs over the last five years or more			1
one industry source said a 45p minimum unit price would see 52 per cent of prices in supermarkets , off - licences and convenience stores rise overnight , including seven out of ten bottles of vodka , six out of ten bottles of vodka and 38 per cent of bottles of wine			1
pubs will get more powers to stop serving alcohol to people who are already drunk , while town hall chiefs will be able to further restrict opening and closing hours , control the density of licensed premises and charge a late - night levy to support policing			0
some @entity63 @entity62 have claimed the policy will have little impact on binge - drinking			1
but home office minister @entity67 insisted action was needed to curb ultra-cheap booze			0
' too many of us have seen city centres on a friday and saturday night often become a vision of hell			0
a lot of this is fuelled by very cheap , very strong alcohol , ' he told @entity79 ’s today programme			0
' the point of having a minimum unit price rather than , say , increasing taxation , is that you can target ... the shops that do deliberately sell very strong drink very cheaply			2
' it is just a fact of economics and indeed of life that if you put the price of a particular product up , demand for it goes down			0
' home secretary @entity94 will use a written statement to @entity96 to launch a ten - week public consultation today			1
but the @entity98 will also pledge to protect responsible drinkers , so supermarkets will continue to be able to offer meal deals that include alcohol , and bulk wine - sellers such as @entity104			2
the consultation will include plans for a review of licensing rules so that they include a ‘ health - related objective ’ for the first time			1
health secretary @entity111 told @entity112 : ' we ’re not seeing this as a revenue - raising measure and we ’ll be publishing what we think the impact will be on revenue			2
we all enjoy a tipple , but what we are trying to do is deal with the excesses			0
' the shake - up will seek to address the ludicrous imbalance whereby in some instances beer is cheaper than mineral water			0
in some shops , it is possible to buy a can of lager for 20p and a two - litre bottle of cider for £ 1.69			1
mr @entity21 has demanded the changes to stamp out binge - drinking in the face of opposition from senior cabinet ministers such as communities secretary @entity138 and education secretary @entity139 , who believe the change will alienate voters who are struggling to make ends meet and simply want a quiet drink			1
@entity63 mp @entity144 accused ministers of moving towards a ' nanny state ' and claimed a minimum price on a unit of alcohol ' wo n’t make a blind bit of difference '			1
' basically what we ’re saying here is we want to basically target poorer people ; we want poorer people to pay more for their alcohol whilst richer people can continue paying the same amount for their alcohol			0
and i ’m afraid to me that ’s completely unacceptable			0
' the minimum price of 45p per unit has been set 5p lower than in @entity165 , where there is a 50p minimum			1
consultation : home secretary @entity94 will launch a ten - week public consultation today legal advice from the @entity171 says the plans are illegal under @entity171 law , as imports would be hit by price hikes , particularly @entity177 brandy and @entity179 cider			1
but sources close to mr @entity21 say he is determined to press ahead to call time on a binge - drinking culture which has seen town centres become no - go areas			1
just under half of all violent crimes involve alcohol , and the effects of binge - drinking are estimated to cost taxpayers £ 21billion a year			1
@entity191 , chair of the @entity192 , backed the minimum alcohol price			2
' we are not killjoys but something has to be done and we have been saying this for three decades			0
' either you restrict sales or you increase prices or you do both , but in the end alcohol is contributory to an enormous amount of not just healthcare costs , but social costs , costs of violence , road traffic accidents and at the very least those little puddles of vomit that one walks past increasingly now , ' she told the @entity79			0
the @entity210 , made up of 32 medical and counselling organisations , said a minimum alcohol price could reduce tens of thousands crimes in @entity214 every year			0

drinks companies warned the higher price would not have the effect the prime minister claims			0
@entity221 , of the wine and @entity223 , called the decision ‘ breathtaking ’ , adding : ‘ the government is ploughing on regardless of evidence , public opinion , taxpayers ’ money and probably the law			1
’ labour home affairs spokesman @entity231 said : ‘ the government needs to make sure it does not just create a cash windfall for the supermarkets , instead of lowering prices of other goods or supporting better prevention and treatment of alcohol abuse to cut crime further and save lives			2
’ @entity242 backed a minimum alcohol price , but called for more action to tackle the ' tsunami of cheap alcohol washing through our streets			2
councillor @entity249 said : ' it is important we keep nudging people towards a more responsible attitude towards alcohol rather than relying on state controls			0
public health ca n’t be controlled by the cash register alone ; the government needs to keep funding front line services which deal with the end results of binge drinking			2
' cleaning up the consequences of the tsunami of cheap alcohol washing through our streets will need more than ending the “ buy one get one free ” culture			0
