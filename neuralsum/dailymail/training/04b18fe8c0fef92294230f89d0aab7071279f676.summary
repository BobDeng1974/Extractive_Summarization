by @entity0 published : 11:10 est , 29 october 2012 updated : 20:57 est , 29 october 2012 some may dream of country mansions and huge yachts , but for the average @entity5 the cost of luxury is somewhat cheaper			0
most believe they could afford a life of luxury on £ 4,413 a month after tax and national insurance are deducted , a study found			1
although this would require an annual salary of more than £ 80,000 – which is more than three times the national average of £ 26,100 – it is a long way short of a tycoon ’s earnings			2
just right : most people think £ 1,922.75 a month is the amount needed for a comfortable lifestyle ( file picture ) the poll of 2,000 people also revealed that most think they need a take - home income of £ 1,722 a month – £ 26,500 a year before tax and @entity25 are deducted – to survive			1
they believe they could live comfortably on £ 1,922 a month – around £ 30,000 a year			1
the study found that millions rank money more highly than friendship or their families			0
three out of ten said money was more important to them than their friends , while 28 per cent named it as more of a priority to them than spending time with their family			0
more than one in four @entity40 considered it to be more important than job security , while 29 per cent think it is more significant than how happy they are in their career			1
for a quarter of those polled , socialising with friends is the first thing to be sacrificed when money is tight			2
another one in ten save money by going out less with their partner while one in 20 spend less on their families			2
' extras ' : gym memberships , charitable donations and new clothes were some of the first things to fall by the wayside for those on a budget ( file picture ) luxuries such as clothes and good food are the most common items to go when on a budget , while gym memberships and charitable donations also get the chop			1
the research , commissioned by @entity71 , an e-commerce business that facilitates online payments , found that more than one in five think cash will disappear over the next 20 years , with the internet and mobile phones being used for purchases instead			0
already , 30 per cent of people use their debit or credit cards to pay for every transaction , however small			1
the survey follows @entity84 ’s much - ridiculed £ 2million state research project into the nation ’s ‘ emotional ’ wellbeing			0
last month it found , perhaps unsurprisingly , that those who have more money are generally a lot happier with their lives			0
but there is a ‘ squeezed middle ’ who appear slightly less happy than those lower down or higher up in the earnings table .			0

most thought £ 1,922.75 a month after tax was the *optimum* amount for a comfortable lifestyle
many sacrifice socialising and going out with a partner when on a budget
gym memberships and charitable donations were also sacrificed to save
a third of @entity40 now use debit or credit cards to pay for everything
