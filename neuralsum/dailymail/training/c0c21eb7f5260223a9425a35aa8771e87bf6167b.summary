fizzy drinks have been much maligned due to their high sugar content			0
now doctors warn the cans that they come in could also be bad for a person 's health			2
a new study has found a common coating used in soft drink cans could cause high blood pressure and put heart patients at risk			1
the chemical @entity13 - known as @entity13 - is widely used as a lining for cans and plastic bottles , but previous studies found it can leach into food and drink			1
the chemical @entity13 known as @entity13 - found in the lining of fizzy drink cans could cause high blood pressure and put heart patients at risk , experts warn @entity28 researchers found drinking from cans increased the concentration of @entity13 in urine by 1,600 per cent when compared to glass bottles			1
drinking two cans a day increased blood pressure by 5 mmg @entity36 , a rise which would cause ' significant problems ' for patients with high blood pressure or heart disease , doctors warned			1
such patients would also need to seek medical if such a rise was seen , they added			2
@entity13 has already been linked to a host of medical problems , including migraines , obesity , diabetes , infertility , heart attacks and even cancer			1
the chemical has already been banned in baby bottles in @entity55 because of safety fears			0
however , the @entity57 - the @entity57 - last year found that @entity13 posed no appreciable health risk to anyone apart from very young children			2
it is currently reviewing its findings , with a new report due before @entity63			0
the new study , carried out by the @entity28 researchers , found ingesting @entity13 was associated with high blood pressure and changes in heart rate			1
dr @entity68 , of the @entity69 , said : ' a 5 mm hg increase in systolic blood pressure by drinking two canned beverages may cause clinically significant problems , particularly in patients with heart disease or hypertension			1
chemicals used to make till receipts could raise the risk of developing harmful diseases such as diabetes , obesity and even cancer , scientists claim			2
alarming research suggests that a substance used to produce paper in store tills , credit card machines and @entity86 could be absorbed into the blood stream			0
researchers say the chemical bisphenol - a - widely known as @entity13 - can disrupt hormones , raising the risk of a wide number of health problems			1
the chemical has already been banned in baby bottles in @entity55 because of safety fears			0
but the transparent resin is still used to line most plastic and tin food packaging - despite the calls for an all - out ban by campaigners			2
' a 20 mm hg increase in systolic blood pressure doubles the risk of cardiovascular disease			1
' a person is normally said to have high blood pressure if the have a pressure of 140/90 mm hg or above			1
the study involved 60 adults over the age of 60 who were given soy milk from glass bottles or cans three times over the course of the study			2
researchers then measured the level of @entity13 in their urine , as well as their blood pressure and heart rate two hours after drinking each beverage			1
soy was chosen as it does n't contain any ingredients that are known to elevate blood pressure			1
they found that the concentration of @entity13 increased by up to 1,600 per cent after consuming canned drinks compared to after consuming the glass - bottled beverages			2
researchers controlled factors such as population characteristics or past medical history			0
time variables , such as daily temperatures , however , could still affect the results , they said			0
dr @entity68 concluded : ' i suggest consumers try to eat fresh foods or glass bottle - contained foods rather than canned foods			0
' hopefully , manufacturers will develop and use healthy alternatives to @entity13 for the inner lining of can containers			0
' @entity157 , @entity159 @entity158 director general , said @entity13 is used in ' virtually all cans used for food and beverage products '			0
he said : ' bpa has been approved safe by the @entity163 and this view is shared by authorities worldwide			0
' the scientific consensus repeatedly stated among regulatory agencies in @entity168 , @entity169 , @entity55 , @entity170 , @entity171 and the @entity172 is that current levels of exposure to @entity13 through food and beverage packaging do not pose a health risk to the general population			0
' the overwhelming majority of soft drinks bottles are made from plastics which do not contain bisphenol a. ' the study was published in the @entity185 's journal @entity186			0
@entity13 has already been linked to a host of medical problems such as migraines , obesity , diabetes , infertility , heart attacks and even cancer			1
pictured is a molecule of bpa			0

@entity198 is used in the lining for cans and plastic bottles
previous studies have found it can leach into food and drink
@entity28 researchers found it increased blood pressure
the rise could cause heart patients to require medical treatment
@entity198 has already been linked to health problems like diabetes , obesity , migraines , infertility , heart attacks and cancer
