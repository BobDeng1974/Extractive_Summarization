the @entity1 is dragging its feet over plans to reinstate exit checks at borders to tackle illegal immigration , @entity0 claimed yesterday			1
the deputy prime minister admitted the government would not meet a pledge to put in a system to track everyone who leaves @entity11 by 2015			1
but he accused home secretary @entity12 of moving too slowly and said he was sending in @entity14 minister @entity13 to speed things up			0
checks : @entity0 said the immigration system inherited from @entity18 was a mess , not least because the last government scrapped exit checks to track who had left @entity11 when their visas expired his attack comes amid growing @entity26 tensions over immigration and appeared to be an attempt to hit back at @entity29 who have embarrassed the @entity14 by accusing them of holding back anti-immigration measures			1
mr @entity0 had objected to a pilot scheme to drive vans around bearing posters telling illegal immigrants to ‘ go home or face arrest ’			1
urgency : the deputy prime minister revealed he has asked a senior @entity14 to put pressure on the @entity1 on a daily basis the @entity14 have also tried to scale back plans for immigration bonds – £ 3,000 payments on top of visas issued to visitors from high - risk countries , repayable only upon leaving @entity11			1
the process of dismantling traditional exit checks at ports and airports began under @entity53 ’s government and was completed by @entity55 ’s ministers			0
one obstacle to the exit checks being brought back in has been delays to the introduction of a £ 750million e-borders scheme that will electronically collate and store information on every passenger entering and leaving @entity11 by boat , plane or train			2
last month , the @entity1 ’s senior civil servant , permanent secretary @entity65 , told @entity66 his department still aimed to set up exit checks before the election in 2015 , he said : ‘ the objective is to have exit checks through e-borders and other mechanisms by 2015 , so essentially by the end of the @entity73			2
’ but mr @entity0 said : ‘ i have been concerned with the urgency with which the @entity1 is seeking to implement the @entity26 commitment that i insisted on – that exit checks should be restored			1
‘ i have asked @entity13 to chase this through @entity77 day in , day out			0
‘ do i think checks will be in all exit places by 2015 ? that is unlikely because of the complexity of it			0
‘ but i hope we will be able to demonstrate very significant progress			0
’ a @entity1 spokesman said : ‘ the government has made a commitment to reintroduce exit checks by 2015			2
the @entity1 will deliver on this			0
