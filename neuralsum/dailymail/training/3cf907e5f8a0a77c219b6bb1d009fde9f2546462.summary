by @entity0 the final @entity0 wrap party in @entity2 last week must have been a big one - neither me or @entity7 have much of a recollection of what happened which must be a good sign			1
anyone who was there please tweet any details to @ spencergeorgem so that we can piece the night together			0
but you know you 've had a good party when you check your phone the next day and there 's a shot of you in a swimming pool with a guy playing a sousaphone			2
felling jazzy : @entity0 says that he found this photo in his phone the morning after his final party in @entity2 at least , i 'm looking in good nick with my kit off ( thanks to @entity30 supplements )			1
anyway , back in the @entity32 finally and ignoring the jet lag i went straight out clubbing			1
tuesday night is the new friday in @entity34 ( well for summer at least ) and @entity36 club in @entity37 was packed			2
i loved @entity2 but it was great to be back			1
the club was full with beautiful people - and there were quite a few women coming up to welcome me back to @entity34 with a kiss			1
welcome back : @entity0 is settling right back into @entity45 life right at home : some female admirers plant a kiss on @entity50 's much obliging cheeks i also hit the @entity52 - it 's a music festival near @entity54 , a boutique younger version of @entity57			2
i went with @entity0 and it was serious back to basics after the luxury of @entity2 living			1
we were definitely not glamping and opted for a basic canvas tent - no luxury yurt for us ! however , we managed to slighly bale out of our accommodation and make some very good new friends in a neighbouring tent			0
in the meantime we 've had some face painting done courtesy of some lovely people from @entity72			0
by the way before some wag makes a wisecrack , i 've been painted as tiger not a cheetah			0
lots of @entity79 , @entity80			0
wild boys : @entity7 had their faces painted courtesy of @entity72			0

@entity0 is *firmly* back in @entity32 soil
however he made sure his final @entity2 bash went out with a bang
he ended up in the pool with a jazz musician and remembers little of it
@entity0 is already back to his old *tricks* with the *ladies* of @entity34
