by @entity0 so many of us have been there			2
you 're in the waiting room as your child goes into the operating theatre			2
the minutes feel like hours , and the hours go on for ever			2
as you wait for news , a nurse comes to put your mind at rest , reassuring you that your child is in the best possible hands			2
and in that moment you feel overwhelming gratitude towards our @entity16			2
i have felt that gratitude so many times			0
so it was no surprise to me that when a poll last year asked people which institution made them most proud to be @entity24 , the @entity16 came top			0
@entity0 pictured with his late son @entity25 at their country home in may 2004 it really is the most precious institution in our country , one of the greatest achievements of the 20th century - and vitally important to my family and to every family in @entity24			1
but when we talk about our great affection for the @entity16 , we 're not talking about the surgeries or the hospitals or the facilities : we 're talking about the people - the 1.7 million health workers who treat a staggering one million of us every 36 hours			1
these people are our superstars in scrubs , our angels in aprons , and the @entity45 give us a fantastic opportunity to thank them for everything they do			1
and there are three reasons why i think it is so important that we do so			1
first , it allows us to show those individuals who go far beyond the call of duty that we are grateful to them			0
it allows us to highlight the things that can not be measured in statistics or graphs or league tables - whether it 's a doctor 's determination to get to the bottom of a mystery illness ; a paramedic 's quick thinking in a life - or - death situation ; or a volunteer 's kind words in a patient 's lowest moments			1
last year , i was asked to nominate my family 's health heroes			1
it was hard to pick just two			0
the first i chose was dr @entity75 , the wonderful consultant paediatrician who looked after our dear son @entity25			0
she never gave up on @entity25 ; she always had that desire to go the extra mile			0
and we will never forget how much she did for our family			0
my second nominee was @entity25 's community nurse , @entity81			1
she did everything she could to get us what we needed , including a social worker , respite care , even a school for @entity25			0
her support was remarkable and invaluable			0
we owe her and dr @entity75 a great deal			0
second , the awards allow us to demonstrate what our health service is really all about			1
often it can feel like the only stories about the @entity16 in the newspapers are negative ones			0
but we need to show that the wrongdoing of a few will never detract from the everyday selflessness of the many			0
there are so many people willing to do whatever they can to help their patients - people such as dr @entity105 , last year 's @entity45 winner			1
this gp visited his terminally - ill patient every evening after work , supporting him and the family through the toughest of times			0
he was nominated for the award by the man 's wife , who was astounded at dr @entity105 's quiet and personal dedication to their family			2
i got to discuss this story , and others from his 30 - year career , when i welcomed dr @entity105 and the other @entity45 finalists to @entity124 last year			1
third , these awards give us a chance to reaffirm our commitment to the health service , whose budget we have been able to safeguard thanks to the tough decisions we 've taken to rebalance our economy			2
i have always thought of the @entity16 as an expression of our values as a nation - a symbol of collective will , of social solidarity			0
and while there is today enormous pressure on the services - with an ageing population , an epidemic of long - term conditions and growing demand for new drugs and technologies - our healthcare workers have continued to meet the challenges with typical @entity24 resilience and resolve			1
so i would urge everyone to nominate their own @entity45 this year			1
and i look forward to joining the @entity154 in celebrating more stories of care and compassion when the nominees and winner are announced .			1
