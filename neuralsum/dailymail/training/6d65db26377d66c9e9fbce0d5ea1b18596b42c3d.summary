@entity0 has hit back at the individuals who sent him death threats during the @entity4 and rasied concerns for his children			1
@entity0 , who broke his arm after a heavy fall in the opening race of the final day , created controversy when he said that animals are replaceable after @entity15 suffered a fatal fall on tuesday			1
the 34 - year - old insisted that his comments had been misunderstood but nonetheless stood by his comments			1
@entity0 jockey @entity0 ( above ) has received death threats after he played down the death of a horse during a race			1
above , @entity0 on @entity24 celebrates victory in the @entity26 during @entity27 at @entity4 on wednesday ' it ’s spineless people that tweet , i ’m 35 so i can ignore it , ' he told the @entity34			1
' but i would worry for my kids that people could tweet them			2
bullying on @entity36 is a serious problem			2
there is no place for bullies			2
' i do n’t apologise for what i said and stand over it , ' he insisted			2
' horses are animals and you keep them out your back door , you do n’t keep your family out your back door			1
you can replace a horse			2
you ca n’t replace a human being			2
that ’s my feeling on it			0
' there ’s a big difference between you going home tonight and something ’s happened to your dog , and you go home tonight and something ’s happened to one of your kids			0
there ’s a huge difference			0
' following his initial comments animal rights campaigners accused the 34 - year - old @entity69 of being callous , while others bombarded him with threats			1
one tweeted : ‘ @entity0 i hope you get your skull crushed by one of the horses you ’re so heartlessly flippant about			1
animals should not die for sport			1
’ another added : ‘ shame more jockeys are n’t killed instead of beautiful horses ! ! ! ! ! ! all jockeys are complete c * * ts ! ! no horse is replaceable ! ’ @entity0 created controversy when he said that animals are replaceable after our @entity88 suffered a fatal fall at @entity4 on the first day of racing			1
above , our @entity88 ( right ) ridden by jockey @entity92 while another wrote : ‘ @ @entity0 do n’t worry if you die in a race , there ’ll be someone to replace you too			1
’ @entity97 of campaign group @entity98 told the @entity99 : ‘ he has shown callousness for the animals that have earned him a good living			2
‘ it ’s completely disrespectful			0
to treat the death of a horse in such a way shows that they are merely machines for people to make money			2
‘ @entity0 is the leading jockey at @entity4 and wants to support the event as much as he can , but you can not disregard the lives of horses just because they are not humans			1
‘ we would expect more from him			0
this shows he has got little empathy for a horse that really suffered before it died			0
’ ' lacking respect ' : @entity0 , seen after taking a record sixth @entity128 ' @entity26 title at the @entity4 on tuesday , has been attacked by animal rights activists @entity130 , founder of @entity131 ( @entity131 ) , said : ‘ @entity0 ’s comments expose the true emotion behind horseracing : greed			1
they are deeply offensive to anyone who has ever loved and lost a horse or other beloved animal companion			0
‘ unlike @entity0 , horses are not unfeeling but experience joy , anxiety , fear and affection , just as human beings do			1
’ one user , with the profile name @entity147 , wrote : ‘ do you hate horses because you are so short and this makes you angry ? ’ in a world of pain : @entity0 fell during the @entity153 and suffered a broken arm another posted : ‘ your ( sic ) an idiot ! ! ‘ a horse can be replaced ’ really ? ? ? so can jockeys so i hope you fall off a horse & get trampled ! ’ since the furore , mr @entity163 ’s father , trainer @entity163 , has compared @entity166 ’s attitude on the issue to that in @entity169			1
he said of the @entity166 : ‘ it ’s a funny country			0
they can remember the names of horses that got blown up by the bombs in @entity175 but not the names of the people riding them			0
’ the @entity178 went on to stress that the welfare of horses is ‘ paramount ’ at races such as @entity4			1
a spokesman said : ‘ @entity183 employs eight veterinary surgeons , whose sole responsibility it is to provide care to the horses throughout their time at the racecourse			0
‘ in the event of an incident on the racecourse , any horse affected will receive immediate attention and treatment from the racecourse ’s veterinary team			0
‘ @entity198 paramedics and doctors are also on hand in the case of any incident involving a jockey			0
‘ if necessary , horses and riders will be transported from the course to receive further treatment at the most appropriate equine hospital or @entity209			0
‘ @entity166 @entity210 is open and transparent about the risks involved in the sport - the @entity214 team monitors injury rates at every licensed racecourse			0
over the last 15 years , the equine fatality rate has fallen by one third to 0.2 per cent of all runners			0
‘ despite the best efforts of all involved , as with participation in any sport involving speed and athleticism , there remains an inherent risk of injury			0
