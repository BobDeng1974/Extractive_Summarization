@entity0 inspired @entity1 to a thumping 28 - 9 win over @entity3 in the @entity4 at @entity5 , @entity6			1
despite the wet conditions , the @entity7 stand - off showed his flair with ball in hand and played key roles in tries for @entity14 ( two ) and @entity15			0
it was an impressive performance from the 23 - year - old , who was making his first @entity19 start at fly - half , with the only small blot on his copybook perhaps his inaccuracy with the boot as he failed to convert all three of those tries			0
score : @entity26 crosses the line to secure @entity1 's bonus point @entity29 : @entity26 dived over in dramatic fashion late in the second half getting stuck in : @entity1 ' captain @entity32 in the thick of the action on the run : @entity0 is pursued by @entity3 's @entity35 @entity36 : @entity1 and @entity3 players had to contend with torrential rain in @entity6 his opposite number @entity35 , who struggled to deal with @entity0 's intelligent breaks all game , kicked all of @entity3 's points			1
the @entity46 will feel aggrieved after they had a perfectly good try ruled out near the end , but the @entity1 will be satisfied after scrum - half @entity26 added a fourth touchdown late on to add gloss to the scoreline			1
@entity0 cut the @entity46 open early on with a chip over the top to @entity14 in the corner , but the towering flyer was prevented from catching for a certain try after a cynical early tackle from @entity58 , who was lucky to escape without punishment			2
it took the visitors five minutes to get out of their own half , with @entity0 missing a penalty in the driving rain , but @entity3 coach @entity66 would have been delighted with their response			0
two strong drives from @entity70 , with the latter seeing him stopped just short of the line , caught the eye as the visitors went through the phases to have a sustained period in all black territory			0
dejected : @entity3 's @entity79 and @entity80 trudge off after losing to @entity1 celebration : @entity83 - r @entity82 and @entity85 relish @entity26 's try up in the air : @entity0 and @entity87 compete for a high ball committed : @entity89 ( 9 ) has a kick charged down by the tenacious @entity91 in vain : @entity93 makes a break against the @entity1 tackle : @entity32 brings down @entity96 eyes on the ball : @entity91 charges down another @entity100 kick but @entity1 's defence is a tough nut to crack and the hosts held out before forcing a penalty at the breakdown further up field			1
this time @entity0 made no mistake and settled his nerves by making it 3 - 0			0
@entity35 deservedly levelled the score with a kick of his own , before the @entity1 struck after 27 minutes			0
@entity0 's grubber sent @entity91 through just past halfway , with the lock showing superb commitment and skills to take the loose ball cleanly , before the hosts shifted it wide and @entity119 's chip bounced favourably for @entity14 to touch down			0
the @entity1 fly - half 's failure to add the conversion looked costly when @entity35 made it 8 - 6 , but @entity0 atoned with a sweeping line break on the inside of his opposite number before putting @entity15 over to make it 13 - 6 on the stroke of half - time			1
he was the orchestrator again as the @entity1 shifted through the gears in the second half , foxing @entity35 with a shimmy before sending the on - rushing @entity14 , racing outside off his wing , over the line for his 26th try in 25 tests in the 44th minute			2
@entity0 failed to add the extras again , with @entity35 clawing it back to 18 - 9 with a kick of his own , before he was replaced by @entity140			1
off target : @entity35 attempts a drop goal during @entity3 's 28 - 9 defeat against @entity1 @entity144 : @entity32 is tackled by the @entity46 @entity145 top of the table : @entity147 challenges @entity148 as @entity1 climbed to the top of the @entity4 standings referee @entity151 stunned the crowd in @entity6 when he inexplicably ruled out a try for @entity3			1
@entity154 charged down a clearance from @entity147 and followed it through to touch down , but the official judged the charge down to be a knock - on - although @entity159 fans might argue it was justice after @entity14 was illegally blocked early doors			0
while the @entity46 were still licking their wounds , @entity140 made it 21 - 9 to @entity165 's side before @entity82 broke off the base of a scrum to send @entity26 strolling over - with @entity140 adding the extras - in the closing moments ,			2

two @entity14 tries and one each from @entity15 and @entity26 lift @entity1 to the top of the @entity4 table
@entity0 and @entity140 kick a penalty *apiece*
@entity140 added a conversion for the @entity1
the @entity46 replied with three penalties from @entity35
@entity181 can climb back to the top of the table with a bonus point *victory* against @entity185 today
