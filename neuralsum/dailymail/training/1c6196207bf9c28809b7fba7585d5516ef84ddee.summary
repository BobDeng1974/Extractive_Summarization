published : 05:11 est , 5 december 2013 @entity1 : 05:16 est , 5 december 2013 the arms of a robot widely used in keyhole surgery could stall and seize up while performing delicate operations , manufacturers have admitted			2
@entity7 , which make the $ 1.5million robotic surgery system said friction in the arms of some devices might make them stall			1
the company has put out an ‘ urgent medical device recall ’ for the robotic arms of its @entity14 , which is used to treat cancer and has been credited with reducing the side - effects of surgery			1
@entity7 , which manufactures the @entity14 robotic surgery system said friction in the arms of some devices might make them stall			1
the company has put out an ' urgent medical device recall ' for the arms of its device , which is used to treat cancer the @entity14 has four spider ‑ like arms , controlled by the surgeon , which hold cutting instruments to make tiny incisions and remove cancerous tissue using images from a telescope to guide the surgeon			1
it features a tiny telescope , which is placed inside an incision in the patient ’s body			0
the telescope takes images from two points , which are relayed back to a console so the surgeon has a 3d image on - screen while he operates			0
previous evidence has shown that using these robots mean significantly less blood loss , reduced risk of blood transfusion and probably a shorter overall recovery time			0
for surgeons , who control the robot while sitting at a computer screen rather than standing over the patient , these operations can be less tiring - and robotic hands do n't shake			0
there have been reported problems with the system , including several disturbing incidents including a robotic hand that would n't let go of tissue grasped during surgery and a robotic arm hitting a patient in the face as she lay on the operating table			2
these accidents - and even several deaths linked to the system - have led to investigation			1
now the company has voluntarily admitted that there could be a problem with some of the robotic arms used in its system			1
the problem could affect 1,386 robotic arms in use across the world , according to the @entity79 ( @entity79 ) , which has been investigating the safety of the robot			1
a statement on its website said stalling in the robotic arms of the system could result in a sudden ‘ catch up ’ if a surgeon perseveres with a move , despite slight resistance from the machine			1
it said : ‘ reports of friction within certain instrument arms can interrupt smooth instrument motion			0
‘ this can be felt by the surgeon as resistance in the movement of the master			0
in this situation , the instrument can stall momentarily and then suddenly catch - up to the master position if the surgeon pushes through the resistance			0
’ the @entity14 has four spider - like arms , controlled by the surgeon , which each hold cutting instruments to make tiny incisions			1
the hands can then be used to remove unwanted growths and organs , depending on the operation being carried out			0
it also features a tiny telescope which is placed inside an incision in the patient 's body the system 's manufacturer has faced questioning over the safety of the @entity14 system 's arms as well as its training procedures , @entity119 reported			1
last month the @entity79 warned the number of system malfunctions , injuries and even deaths connected with the robotic device have doubled in 2013 compared with 2012			1
@entity7 put out its own statement about the recall last month			2
it said : ‘ @entity7 has issued a field notice informing affected @entity137 , @entity138 , and @entity140 customers that it is voluntarily initiating a correction for the @entity142 on the @entity143 and repairing or replacing them as needed			2
’ previous evidence has shown using these robots , rather than surgeon 's hands , results in less blood loss , reduced risk of blood transfusion and a shorter overall recovery time talking about its safety record , the @entity154 - based company said : ‘ out of more than 55,000 procedures completed with this group of instrument arms , there has been one reported instance of interrupted motion resulting in an imprecise cut , along with two additional instances of perceived resistance			1
‘ no patient complications were reported in association with these three instances			0
’ the company said it is performing ‘ comprehensive ’ inspections to test its equipment in the field and repair or replace affected robotic arms			1
it said that around 70 per cent of the inspections are complete and most of the robotic arms did not require any adjustments			2
the @entity14 has four spider ‑ like arms , controlled by the surgeon , which hold cutting instruments to make tiny incisions and remove cancerous tissue part using images from a telescope to guide the surgeon			2

for surgeons , who control the robot while sitting at a computer screen rather than standing over the patient , these operations can be less tiring - and robotic hands do n't shake			0
a 2002 study in the journal @entity207 found prostate cancer surgery done by @entity14 robots had better outcomes for continence and cancer control than keyhole approaches done by the human hand			2
the robot is also now used for heart bypass surgery , heart valve repair and hysterectomy .			0

@entity7 , @entity154 , makes the $ 1.5million robotic surgery system
it has put out an ‘ urgent medical device recall ’ for the robotic arms of its @entity14 that could affect 1,386 robotic arms in use *globally*
the device is used to treat cancer and has been credited with reducing the side - effects of surgery , but has also be linked to injuries and deaths
