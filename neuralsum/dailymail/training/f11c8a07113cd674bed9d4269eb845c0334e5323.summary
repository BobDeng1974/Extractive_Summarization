could this be the weekend @entity0 wrapped up the @entity2 title - despite losing for the first time this season at @entity5 ? as @entity0 's 3,000 - plus travelling fans were making their way back south , wallowing in the unfamiliar sensation of defeat , phones would have lit up and hearts would have been lifted by the news coming in from @entity13			1
for at the @entity15 , @entity14 was hobbling from the field in tears			0
the deadly @entity19 striker , who has scored an incredible 19 goals in 20 matches this season , was clearly in agony - you could tell simply from the grimace on his face			2
videos scroll down to watch a visibly emotional @entity14 prepares to leave the field after suffering a knee injury against @entity30 @entity14 grimaces with pain after going down following a tackle by @entity33 early in the match @entity14 was able to walk off unaided but will have a scan on his knee this week to find out the damage @entity38 beat @entity30 1 - 0 to cut the gap to just three points after @entity0 lost at @entity5 slowly , the news emerged that every @entity38 fan had feared			1
suspected knee ligament damage , mri scans this week , the possibility of their talisman on the sidelines for weeks , maybe months			1
so on the day @entity38 trimmed @entity0 's lead at the @entity2 summit to just three points , finally breathing new life into the title race , a potential disaster			1
as @entity55 pundit @entity54 tweeted : ' if @entity14 's injury is a bad one then this could be the weekend @entity0 won the league ! ' while we wo n't know for certain about the extent of @entity14 's injury until the middle of the week - though he will certainly miss their make - or - break @entity62 trip to @entity64 - we do know that @entity38 have been adversely affected before by his absence			1
@entity55 pundit @entity54 tweeted that @entity14 's injury could decide the outcome of the title race @entity14 celebrates after scoring the second of his two goals in @entity38 's 4 - 1 midweek win at @entity71 in all , @entity14 has scored 19 goals in 20 matches so far this season , including a hat - trick against @entity76 @entity14 is carried off on a stretcher after suffering an injury in @entity38 's match with @entity80 in august 2012 since the striker arrived from @entity82 in 2011 , he has played in 102 @entity2 matches and missed a total of 27 either through injury or selection			1
@entity38 's win percentage dips from 69.6 per cent to 63 per cent when @entity14 is not in the side			1
in his second campaign at @entity90 , @entity14 missed two league matches with a knee problem in march			0
one of them saw a 2 - 0 defeat at @entity30 that pretty much ended any hopes of catching @entity96 in the title race			0
last season , he was out injured for @entity38 's trip to @entity100 in late september and they lost 3 - 2			2
and his lengthy absence with hamstring and knee problems late in the campaign included a 1 - 0 home loss to @entity0			0
his absence did n't affect @entity38 in the title race - they ultimately secured the title - but his hamstring troubles did contribute to their exit from the @entity62 at the hands of @entity112			0
a comparison of @entity38 's performances with and without @entity14 in the @entity2			1
source : @entity116 @entity117 's scored twice as @entity5 inflicted @entity0 's first defeat of the season on saturday @entity14 's injury presents a headache for city manager @entity122 ahead of the @entity124 schedule 19 - @entity14 6 - @entity125 5 - @entity126 4 - @entity127 , @entity128 2 - @entity129 but there have also been spells when @entity14 has been out injured and @entity38 have not really missed him			1
for example , he had a calf injury about this time last season and @entity38 still won all five league matches in his absence			0
the reality is that @entity14 has become an even more talismanic figure this season			0
it is not just his remarkable goalscoring run that has pretty much kept @entity38 in contention both at home and in @entity144 , but the astonishing work rate and creativity that sets up goals for others			0
if the worst fears are realised and @entity14 is ruled out for the pivotal and congested @entity124 and @entity152 fixture list , the burden will fall heavily on @entity38 's other stars			1
most have not yet reached the heights of last year			0
their first test will come in the cauldron of the @entity157 on wednesday night as @entity38 try to prolong their @entity144 campaign beyond @entity124			0
but if @entity14 is sidelined for a while , @entity38 's next challenge is to find a way of compensating for the lost goals he would have provided			2
the goalscoring burden now falls on @entity127 , who has four so far this season @entity128 has also contributed four goals so far this campaign but will now get more game time @entity14 has 19 in all competitions this season			2
the next highest is the six scored by @entity125			0
of the other strikers at @entity122 's disposal , @entity127 and @entity128 have just four apiece			0
with @entity38 's main source of goals cut off , @entity0 could easily have re-established their commanding lead at the top by @entity124			1
city fans will be awaiting news of @entity14 's hospital scans , praying this injury is n't as bad as it first appeared .			2
