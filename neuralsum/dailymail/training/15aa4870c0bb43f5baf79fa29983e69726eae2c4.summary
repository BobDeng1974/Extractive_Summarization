' for a country still rebuilding from the devastation of the @entity103 , still facing rationing and still finding its way in a post-war world , this jubilant event brought a new sense of purpose and energy to the nation ; not unlike the recent @entity111 of 2011			0
' liberation hero : @entity113 , the @entity115 black rights campaigner , is among the historical figures remembered in the archives never forget : another exhibit shows the inscriptions in the many books sent to @entity67 during his long years of incarceration the d - day exhibition , produced in collaboration with the @entity124 , shows details of the famous landings including colour photographs , personal letters and the @entity130 order itself from admiral @entity131			2

' we ’ve featured a vast array of material , which you will be able to view at your leisure in high resolution , for professional or personal use , at any time and in any place			0

@entity163 , director of fundraising and partnerships at the foundation , said : ' we decided to participate because bringing this material online through the @entity133 provides a great opportunity to make known not only the legacy of @entity113 - but so many other historic figures and events - in a dynamic and accessible way			2
