@entity2 ’s failure to take military action against @entity4 may have cost @entity5 a £ 6billion deal to sell fighter jets to the @entity8 , experts claimed last night			1
the prime minister faced a massive snub when the oil - rich @entity12 state suddenly pulled the plug on plans to buy 60 @entity16 from defence giant @entity17 on thursday			1
following a year of talks , the aerospace firm admitted the @entity8 had ‘ elected not to proceed ’ on the purchase of a range of defence and security equipment			1
no deal : @entity2 flew out to the @entity8 to convince @entity25 to go ahead with a deal with @entity17 , but did not succeed the decision was a blow for mr @entity2 , who flew to @entity29 last month to persuade crown prince @entity25 to buy the warplanes , which are also in service with the @entity33			1
defence analysts said the government had paid the price for failing to be ‘ robust ’ over @entity4 ’s president @entity37 , who killed more than 1,400 civilians in a chemical weapon attack in a bid to crush pro-democracy rebels			2
in august , mr @entity2 suffered a humiliating @entity43 defeat over plans for missile strikes on @entity4 - seen as a grave threat to @entity48 stability			1
but inaction by @entity50 over @entity51 - and @entity54 ’s nuclear ambitions - fuelled concerns in the @entity12 about the @entity5 ’s long - term commitment to the region ’s stability			2
dr @entity58 , of the @entity60 think - tank , said : ‘ @entity5 did n’t really do a great deal in relation to @entity4 and this may have undermined [ the @entity8 ’s ] confidence			1
but dr @entity58 suggested the lucrative contract might not be ‘ dead in the water ’ because the @entity8 still needed fighter jets			0
‘ i would n’t be surprised if there was a deal on this in the next year , ’ he added			1
however , @entity72 , of the @entity73 , said : ‘ all sorts of things can affect these deals and not just to do with the quality of the aircraft concerned			0
’ @entity8 military chiefs are said to prefer the @entity80 following its performance in @entity82 during the 2011 campaign to oust @entity84			1
abandoned : the @entity16 , pictured , will no longer be bought by the @entity8 the decision to axe the deal was a blow to @entity17 , which has been increasingly eyeing overseas sales to offset declining @entity90 budgets			2
it raised fears that the firm , which makes the aircraft in collaboration with @entity97 group @entity96 and @entity99 ’s @entity98 , could be beaten to the contract by @entity102 ’s @entity101 , manufacturer of the rival @entity104 fighter			0
last year the aerospace manufacturer lost out to @entity101 to supply 126 jets to @entity107 – although the final negotiations were marred by bribery accusations when a manager was accused of paying about £ 250 to an official for providing a better site to exhibit its products at an air show			0
the @entity102 also have an airbase near @entity116 and the @entity8 has an existing fleet of @entity102 - built @entity118 - 9 warplanes			0
the @entity104 fighter is cheaper than the @entity80 but is considered not as capable			0
@entity121 , an independent defence analyst , said the @entity102 are not ‘ in this race ’			0
‘ this is a campaign that has not been lost but it has not been won			0
nobody else has won this deal – it has essentially gone away , ’ he said			2
a @entity128 source said the deal was ‘ always going to be a tricky one ’ because the @entity8 has been in talks with @entity102 for a long time and the @entity80 entered the process quite late in the process			1
a government spokesman added : ‘ it was always going to be a difficult deal to do			2
and as @entity17 have said , it was an exciting prospect but not part of their business plan			0
’ @entity17 assembles @entity16 for the @entity33 and for @entity140 at its plant in @entity142 , @entity143 , where it employs more than 5,000 workers .			0

experts claim lack of military **intervention** could have *scuppered* deal
talks *collapsed* on thursday after years negotiation , including an **intervention** by @entity2
