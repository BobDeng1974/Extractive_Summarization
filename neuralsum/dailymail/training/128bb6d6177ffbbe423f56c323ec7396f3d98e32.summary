by @entity0 published : 05:41 est , 21 november 2013 updated : 05:56 est , 21 november 2013 is this the lumpiest road in @entity2 ? a 94 - yard village street with just 16 semi-detached homes has residents fuming after they counted 80 potholes			1
they will have to endure the bumps through winter as there is no money left to repair @entity10 , @entity11 - and there is no guarantee it will be done next year either			1
driven potty : @entity15 has only just begun but residents of bumpy @entity10 in @entity17 , @entity11 , have counted 80 potholes			1
there is no money left to fix them until at least next spring appalling : how one resident described the road , claiming it was the worst in @entity2 - is yours even worse ? funding gap : @entity27 @entity26 says it will not prioritise the street because it is a minor road @entity30 , 80 , has launched a petition calling on @entity32 to fix @entity10 , in @entity17			1
he said : ' it 's in a terrible state			2
it has been like this since i moved in 30 years ago			2
it has just got worse and worse			2
' there are a lot of old people in the street and those in wheelchairs are having difficulty getting across the road			1
those driving cars are finding the road terrible as well			2
' they are trying to dodge them but you ca n't anymore - there are that many of them			1
' it is definitely worse than any other street in @entity2 that i know of			2
' @entity59 , 80 , said : ' those in wheelchairs are having difficulty getting across the road ' residents of the street 's 16 houses have threatened to sue the council if their cars are damaged by the bumps a nightmare on @entity10 : the street in @entity17 , @entity11 , is just 94 yards long @entity26 says repairing the road will cost £ 5,157 , a price it can not afford - because its road repairs budget has already dried up			1
executive director @entity75 said : ' the council 's current mainstream road resurfacing budget is fully committed for the current year			2
councils across @entity79 and @entity80 have united to claim potholes will hit ' crisis point ' this winter			1
they begged the government for more cash , saying years of spending cuts meant projects already ' on the back burner ' were being delayed further and further			0
transport chairman for the @entity90 , cllr @entity91 , blamed ' decades of underfunding by @entity93 '			0
he said in march : ' we 're now facing a bill of £ 10.5 billion to bring our roads up to scratch			1
unless something changes we risk swathes of @entity2 's road network becoming dangerously strewn with potholes , particularly if flooding and severe winters become more common			1
' potholes appear over winter when water repeatedly freezes and thaws inside cracks in the road surface , opening them wider			1
most councils use instant ' emergency repairs ' to fix danger potholes , but these have to be followed up with a permanent , more expensive fix which many authorities say they are struggling to afford			1
' @entity10 will be considered for resurfacing during the next financial year commencing in april 2014			1
' it should be noted , however , that there is no guarantee that funding will be available			0
the street is a quiet cul - de - sac and major roads and bus routes will take priority			0
' he added there had already been ' extensive ' pothole repairs carried out in recent years to keep the road safe			0
resident @entity125 , 67 , said : ' i am disgusted at the decision			1
there is another winter ahead and it is only going to get worse			0
' it is going to cost the council more in the long - term			0
if my car is damaged when reversing i 'll be claiming off them , that 's for sure			0
' her husband @entity137 , 69 , added : ' the council keeps going on about @entity17 being @entity141 's jewel in the crown and yet they are allowing the road outside our homes to get into this state			0
it is damaging the look of the area			0
' what would happen if i had to put my house up for sale and a prospective buyer came and saw the state of road ? there 's no way i could sell it at its true value			0
' another resident , who did not want to be named , said : ' i think it is very dangerous			1
in this street 80 to 85 per cent of residents are old aged pensioners			2
i am 80 years old and my wife is 79			2
' there is a lady in a wheelchair who has to travel up the street to find a safer part of the road to cross			0
the whole surface of the road is falling to pieces			0
' ' i am appalled by the state of it			0
if it was @entity182 ' row it would be done immediately			0
it is only going to get worse when the bad weather comes			0
' abandoned : residents in @entity10 claimed the road would have fixed if it was on ' @entity187 '			1

@entity10 , @entity11 , has just 16 houses but 80 potholes
