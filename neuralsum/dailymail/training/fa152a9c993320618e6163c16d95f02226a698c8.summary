deputy prime minister @entity0 encouraged the @entity1 to give airtime to organisations that promote the legalisation of drugs including heroin @entity0 encouraged the @entity1 to give airtime to organisations that promote the legalisation of drugs including heroin , it was revealed yesterday			1
before the publication of a highly controversial report on drugs , the deputy prime minister ’s office tried to persuade the corporation to introduce the campaigners as ‘ third voices ’ in the debate			1
they included some activists who believe our current drugs laws are a breach of human rights			1
the disclosure of an aide ’s attempt to spin the @entity1 ’s presentation of the report , which compared the drugs policies of different countries , came as a major row erupted up within the @entity33 over the issue			1
in the wake of the publication of the @entity38 report , @entity35 called for radical change to @entity41 ’s drug laws			1
they hailed the report as ‘ overwhelming ’ proof that there was no benefit to having tough penalties on drugs , with mr @entity0 accusing the @entity49 of having a ‘ totally misplaced , outdated , backward - looking view ’			1
he even suggested the report should be ‘ a wake - up call ’ for @entity54 and @entity55			1
but others pointed out that the report explicitly stated it would be ‘ inappropriate ’ to claim its findings supported a case for legalisation – and acknowledged that drug use in the @entity41 , where there are tough penalties for dealing and possession , had decreased markedly in recent years			1
meanwhile , countries where laws have been liberalised have seen a substantial rise in drug use			0
@entity69 said the report provided ‘ no support whatsoever ’ for decriminalisation			2
and mr @entity54 attacked mr @entity0 ’s remarks , saying drugs posed a danger to young people and that as a father he would never suggest they were safe			2
‘ the evidence is , what we are doing is working , ’ he said			0
‘ i do n’t believe in decriminalising drugs that are illegal today			0
' i ’m a parent with three children , i do n’t want to send a message that taking drugs is okay or safe , it simply is n’t – it ’s a danger			0
‘ the biggest problem we have is these so - called legal highs , drugs that are sold openly and are the real danger for young people			2
@entity54 held a @entity93 at an @entity94 in @entity95 , @entity96 , today - in which he rejected calls for drugs to be decriminalised ‘ i want us to have tougher powers so that we ban legal highs , take them off the high street and protect more of our young people			1
’ mr @entity0 ’s attempt to manipulate the @entity1 came in the hours before the official publication of the @entity38 report			1
an aide working for the deputy prime minister sent journalists on the flagship radio 4 today programme and other current affairs shows an email picking out the @entity35 ’ favoured passages , many of which amounted to arguments for decriminalisation			1
astonishingly , the email from special adviser @entity119 recommended that producers and reporters at the @entity1 and other broadcasters contact @entity123 of @entity124 and @entity125 of @entity126			1
@entity124 , a charity founded in the 1960s to give legal and other help to drug users , is calling for the decriminalisation of drug possession offences in the @entity41			2
transform , a charity , campaigns for the legalisation of drugs			0
it states on its website that ‘ prohibition does n’t work and never will ’			0
today producers rejected the aide ’s advice , instead interviewing @entity35 home office minister @entity142 , who wants drug laws relaxed , and @entity145 mp @entity144 , who is opposed to legalising drugs			1
a spokesman for mr @entity0 said : ‘ the deputy prime minister has been very clear that he does not support the legalisation of drugs and does not endorse the campaigning positions of any particular organisation			1
‘ these are two respected organisations in this field and it is entirely understandable that the media would want to speak with them			0
’ the @entity38 report followed a series of visits by mr @entity142 to countries with varying policies on drugs			2
it suggested that tough penal regimes are no more successful than liberal decriminalised systems at reducing levels of drug abuse			0
a key country on mr @entity142 ’s tour was @entity170 , which decriminalised drugs in 2001			0
the report claimed , controversially , that the policy has been a success			0
mr @entity142 said : ‘ @entity41 ’s drug laws need a radical change			1
ending prison sentences for drug users would give us more time to crack down on the criminal gangs that supply illegal drugs			0
’ mr @entity0 accused the @entity49 of taking a ‘ facile ’ approach to the issue			0
@entity35 sources accused mr @entity54 of hypocrisy , pointing out that as a backbench mp he took a relatively liberal approach			0
in 2002 he said it was ‘ baffling ’ that the then @entity190 government was not looking at decriminalisation			0
yesterday , mr @entity54 called the @entity38 report ‘ interesting ’ but added : ‘ i do n’t think anyone can read that report and say it definitely justifies this approach or that approach			1
’ @entity199 chairman @entity198 warned against ‘ giving succour ’ to drug addicts			2
dr @entity198 , a former gp , said : ‘ i do n’t have any moralistic view on taking drugs other than the fact that i object to people supporting one of the most evil businesses and cartels worldwide			0
' it always surprises me that people who would perhaps object to buying coffee in @entity214 and would refuse to support @entity215 are quite happy to support these cartels that cause untold misery to hundreds of thousands around the world			0
’ what the @entity35 did n't mention on his tour of television and radio studios in the wake of the @entity38 report , @entity0 declared it was clear evidence of an urgent need to relax drugs laws			1
but the 55 - page document throws up countless findings that contradict him – and which he conveniently declined to mention			0
even @entity35 home affairs minister @entity142 , writing in the foreword , said there were ‘ positive signs that [ the government ’s ] approach is working ’			2
@entity0 's stance on the drug debate was undermined by the 55 - page report after he declared there was clear evidence of an urgent need to relax drug laws he cited the ‘ long - term downward trend ’ of drug use , the fall in heroin and cocaine users in @entity250 to below 300,000 for the first time and that those in treatment are ‘ more likely than ever to leave free from addiction ’			1
@entity0 ’s stance is again undermined , when the report states : ‘ there is robust evidence that drug use among adults has been on a downward trend since the mid- 2000s			2
’ drug use in adults in the past year peaked at 12.3 per cent in 2003 - 04 and had fallen to 8.8 per cent in the latest surveys			2
the figures for users aged 11 to 15 also fell , from 20 to 11 per cent			0
the deputy prime minister ignored a section rubbishing claims that decriminalisation reduced the burden on police , which stated : ‘ the number of people coming into formal contact with the police for possession offences has remained broadly stable			1
’ the report supported tougher punishments , saying : ‘ we heard arguments both for decriminalisation and “ zero tolerance ” policies … and all were able to demonstrate some success			2
’ the @entity35 cited @entity170 , where possession of small amounts of drugs ceased to be a criminal offence in 2001 , as an example to follow			0
they said the number of drug users had not increased since the laws were relaxed and said health problems , including @entity293 and @entity294 , had fallen			0
the report has put the @entity33 on a collision path and its concluding observation emphatically does not back decriminalisation of drugs but the report said the health improvements may be linked to a significant funding boost for healthcare rather than slackening drugs laws , adding : ‘ with regard to @entity170 … it is difficult to disentangle the effect of decriminalisation from wider improvements in treatment and harm reduction during the same period			1
’ mr @entity0 failed to mention the @entity312 , which had similar drug possession laws to @entity170 yet had ‘ levels of cannabis use among the highest in @entity316 ’			1
the report ’s concluding observation emphatically does not back decriminalisation of drugs			0
the problem was ‘ more complex and nuanced than legislation and enforcement alone , ’ it stated , adding that it would be ‘ inappropriate to compare the success of drug policies in different countries ’			2
mr @entity0 seized on a section which stated there was no clear relationship between stiff penalties and the number of addicts .			0
