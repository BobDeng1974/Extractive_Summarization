prosecutor @entity53 said : ‘ the injuries were a culmination of a series of violent acts by her towards her vulnerable son			0
‘ she must have realised she was causing @entity5 a great deal of pain			1
her last and fatal assault on him involved a forceful impact on his head			1
' it must have been a directly blow to his head or striking his head on something			0
‘ it may have been done in a moment of temper , it might have been regretted immediately after it was done but at the critical moment that was her intention			0

’ @entity44 told one witness that ‘ she dreaded taking him back to his mum as his mum must think she beats him ’			0

mr @entity158 said that @entity44 did not take her son to the nursery between march 8 and 9			2
‘ the prosecution suggest she may have been keeping @entity5 away while he made some recovery from the effects of the injuries she had caused to him at that time , ’ he added			1

on march 17 , @entity44 explained away bruising by claiming that @entity5 had fallen off a toy at the nursery			1
she told staff she was not bringing him to a ‘ stay and play ’ event the next day because she did not have to look after her cousin ’s child on fridays			2
