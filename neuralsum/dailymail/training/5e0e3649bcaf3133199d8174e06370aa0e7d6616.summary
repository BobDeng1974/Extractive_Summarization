by @entity0 a bookmaker 's have accused television insiders and friends in the know of betting on the outcome of the eagerly anticipated @entity6 after a flurry of bets were placed on ' outsider ' @entity10			1
@entity11 were left badly burned by the bets on eventual winner @entity13 , who had been backed at just 5 - 2 when betting opened after last week 's semi final			1
however , the odds for the 31 - year - old quickly rose to 11 - 10 , making her favourite , after punters rushed to back her			2
pay out : @entity22 's coral were forced to close its @entity6 book after a flurry of bets were placed on ' outsider ' @entity10 , prompting fears of television insiders placing wagers on the outcome fearing insiders had been betting on the pre-recorded @entity32 show , @entity11 were forced to suspend the book after 90 per cent of wagers favoured miss @entity10			1
the children 's clothing designer had been seen as an outsider to take the top prize , as judges @entity39 and @entity41 regularly criticised her spectacular creations as a victory for ' style over substance '			0
her rival @entity46 , 30 , had been favourite to be named champion , having been initially given odds of 11 - 8			1
however , miss @entity10 saw off ms @entity46 and 21 - year - old @entity50 , who had been backed at 6 - 4 , thanks to her rainbow - style savoury picnic pie and show stopper three - tier wedding cake , inspired by the @entity54 play @entity55			2
tuesday night 's final was watched by more than nine million viewers			0
rising odds : @entity10 was initially the 5 - 2 outsider , but her odds quicky rose to 11 - 10 making her the firm favourite ' we were the only bookmaker to actually take bets on @entity6 off after last week ’s semi-final , and we did so knowing that as the show was pre-recorded someone somewhere would know the outcome , so we always kept stakes quite low , but that did n’t stop plenty of people getting their bets on before we took the decision to suspend betting because more than 90 per cent of bets taken were for @entity10 , ' said @entity11 ’s @entity76			1
' @entity46 , the original 11 - 8 favourite , and @entity41 ’s favourite , @entity50 , 6 - 4 second favourite , hardly attracted a bet between them , and their odds drifted to 2 - 1 and 3 - 1 respectively			1
' most of the bets were placed online , many from new customers , and we face a four figure payout now @entity10 has been crowned champion , so it ’s fair to say we have had our fingers burned by this @entity6			0
final three : @entity10 , pictured second from right , with her fellow bake off finalists and judges , from left , @entity50 , @entity39 , @entity46 and @entity41 ' however we have no complaints as there was always a risk attached to betting on a non-live show , and for those who backed @entity10 , her victory really was the icing on the cake			2
' mr @entity76 said that @entity11 had not contacted police about the insider fears , but said that the bookmaker was unsure if bets would be taken on next year 's show - which is due to move to @entity108 due to its popularity			0
he added : ' we have lost a few thousand but we take that on the chin , it 's been good fun and we have maybe learned our lesson			0
' we will see what we do about it next year			0
' a @entity32 spokesman said the broadcaster would not be commenting on the claims .			0
