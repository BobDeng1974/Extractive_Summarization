@entity1 's @entity0 will look to complete a unique double at @entity5 golf and country club this week			1
@entity0 is part of a 78 - strong field for the @entity8 , which is co-sanctioned by the @entity9 and @entity10 and is being held on the same course where he won the @entity13 on the @entity14 in april			1
and the former world number one could then make it an impressive three wins on the same course in 10 months , with the @entity13 switching to february on the 2015 @entity14 schedule			2
@entity0 is going for a second win at the @entity5 golf and country club in the @entity8 ' i 'm playing nicely at the moment , ' @entity0 told a pre-tournament press conference			1
' i played well in @entity24 ( finishing 12th at the @entity25 ) a couple of weeks ago and it 's nice for me that it 's a nice setting here			0
' @entity0 won his 13th tournament in @entity29 the week after finishing seventh in the masters and added : ' i played it at 18 - under - par and won by seven so you 'd have to say it suits my game			2
that was a great week and it 's strange i 'm going to be playing three tournaments in 10 months on this golf course			0
' it does n't often happen and there 's obviously the reason for that ... it 's obviously a good golf course because they keep putting tournaments around it and people enjoy playing it			0
@entity0 , pictured during round one of the @entity25 , finished 12th at the tournament in @entity24 ' i 'm the most recent winner around this golf course so i 'm pretty confident as far as this week 's tournament is concerned			2
' @entity0 has won in @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 and @entity57 and knows exactly what is needed to succeed in the testing conditions which can usually be relied upon to spark afternoon thunderstorms			1
' you 're not going to function if you get dehydrated out there and lose energy , ' the 41 - year - old added			0
' your brain is going to stop working and then you need to use your common sense and have good course - management skills			0
the @entity1 will play alongside @entity68 and @entity69 in the first two rounds of the @entity8 ' i think there are a lot of opportunities to take holes on out there , but at the same time there are a lot of opportunities to play conservatively and take par on certain holes			1
you do n't want to be coming out of the rough , because the greens seem to stay firm			0
' @entity0 will play alongside @entity83 team - mate @entity68 and @entity84 opponent @entity69 in the first two rounds			1
the winner will claim $ 1.2million from the overall prize fund of $ 7million , as well as a place in next year 's masters at @entity90 .			0
