some @entity2 , @entity1 residents say in a new survey that they want the @entity6 shooter 's home torn down and the property turned into a park or nature preserve			1
the @entity2 - @entity10 received more than 1,600 responses to the survey it released on monday on town residents ' unmet needs in the wake of the december 2012 shootings			1
the foundation has been deciding how to distribute more than $ 11 million in donations made in response to the shootings , which left 20 first - graders and six educators dead			1
some survey responses said money should be set aside to tear down gunman @entity24 's house in @entity2 , where he killed his mother before going to the school			1
this is a photo of the @entity29 residence on december 19 , 2012 in @entity2 , @entity1 shortly after the shooting took place the survey found that counseling and cash assistance services were among families ' top priorities			1
some of the charities paying for mental health care for children and families affected by the @entity6 massacre are running short of money and officials do n't know how much they 'll need — and for how long — to repair the psychological scars from the mass shooting			2
@entity2 officials are applying for a federal grant and charities are pooling their resources in an attempt to ensure that free long - term mental health care remains available following the december 2012 shooting that left 20 first graders and six teachers dead			1
' we hear in the media , ' well @entity6 was 14 months ago , is n't everything fine ? '' said @entity58 , executive director of the @entity59			0
well , no it 's not and we get calls every day from the school wanting to address an issue			2
i would love to say that in 10 years we 're going to see a huge drop and everyone 's better and we 've moved on , but that 's not the case			0
' three of the charities that have been providing funds for services have started working together , while the charity that has raised the most money — the @entity2 - @entity10 — says that it will likely join the alliance soon			1
@entity24 shot his mother @entity6 ( pictured ) in their @entity1 home before he made his final journey to @entity6 photo of @entity24 taken when he was a middle school student at @entity80 in @entity2 , @entity1 @entity24 shot his mother in their @entity1 home before he went to @entity6 elementary and shot 20 first graders and six educators the @entity86 , which raised $ 350,000 for mental - health services in the wake of the shooting , has told the 250 people it served that it could no longer directly pay their mental health bills because fundraising was being outpaced by demand			1
' the demand was well beyond anything we could have predicted , ' said @entity97 , president of the @entity86			0
other charities are picking up the slack			0
the town 's @entity100 and the @entity102 , which had been spending a combined $ 30,000 a month on mental health care for 150 families , partnered with the @entity86 , said @entity105 , founder of the @entity102			1
those who need help are being steered to the state 's @entity108 , which processes applications for money from a pool created by all three charities			2
so far , nobody has been turned down			0
' i do n't think anybody has a crystal ball to say whether there 's going to be enough money or not , ' said @entity120 , the director of the state @entity121 ' i do know that the plan is for a 15 - year horizon			1
' the @entity2 - @entity10 has about $ 4 million left after giving more than $ 7 million to the 40 families most affected by the shooting			1
much of the remaining money likely will go into the mental health care pool , said @entity129 , the foundation 's executive director			2
she said they expect to announce an alliance with the @entity86 / @entity100 / @entity102 group in the coming weeks			0
we recognize that as the largest of the funds , we will need to pick up the slack over the years as some of the other funds really dwindle — as the @entity86 ' has , ' she said			0
the idea is to still have money available as those who were in elementary school at the time of the shooting reach adulthood			2
meanwhile , the town is seeking more than $ 7 million in a federal grant , in part to help cover the next 18 months of costs for the nonprofit agencies providing free mental health care			2
the grant also would create a ' recovery and resiliency ' board , which would help match people with specific services and programs			0
in this handout crime scene evidence photo provided by the @entity159 , shows @entity24 's house on @entity161 following the december 14 , 2012 shooting rampage at @entity6 ' this is about building a safety net of ongoing support for those in the mental health system , and to capture new people who have needs , ' @entity163 , the town 's first selectwoman , told town officials when announcing the grant application two months ago			1
@entity58 said her organization saw an 85 percent jump in clients after the @entity6 shooting , and had to quadruple its staff , adding 29 positions			0
they have been providing everything from intense one - on - one therapy , to simple advice to parents who come in asking how to deal with their children 's questions about the shooting			2
another nonprofit , the @entity188 of @entity2 , opened in september			0
it has served about 500 people with free programs such as art and music therapy , grief counseling , and parenting classes			0
@entity197 , the executive director , said they have been funded with private donations , but she is counting on the federal grant money to keep the programing going			0
while they await a response to the grant request , @entity197 said it 's clear the services are having an impact			1
' after all the therapy she 'd been through since 12/14 we never thought we 'd have her back , ' the mother of a @entity6 student who completed a self - esteem program wrote in an email shared by @entity197			0
