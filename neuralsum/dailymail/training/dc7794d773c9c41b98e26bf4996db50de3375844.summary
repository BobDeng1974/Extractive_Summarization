fans of the new @entity2 series @entity3 , which is based on the rise of @entity5 from lowly blacksmith 's son to @entity9 's chief minister , have been drooling over the beautiful gowns , shining jewels and awe - inspiring architecture of @entity13			1
but do n't be fooled by the glamour - life in @entity13 was tough for women ( even if you were n't one of @entity9 's wives on her way out of favour )			1
during the 16th century , it was illegal for women to take on many jobs , they were considered the property of men and it was considered reasonable for a husband to beat his wife			1
women 's main role in society was giving birth , which was an extremely dangerous process in the 1500s and often resulted in death			1
even small things like getting dressed in the morning was an arduous task , with layers and layers of clothing needed to conform to social standards			0
and after jumping through all of these hoops , women were given little thanks , with their male counterparts seeing them as evil temptresses who had led to the fall of man			1
@entity67 's guide to life for women during the reign of @entity9 : @entity32 ( played by @entity71 ) was one of @entity73 's most powerful women after marrying @entity9 ( above , @entity74 ) but she was still beholden to him and the men in her family tudor sex sex in @entity13 was n't supposed to be fun , especially for women			1
the church dictated many of the rules of the time - they said that sex was solely for procreation purposes and only ever between husband and wife			0
not only that , but missionary sex was the only position allowed , because other styles were thought to let the devil into the bedroom and lead to a deformed child			0
according to historians , a married couple were also forbidden from having sex on tuesdays , fridays , sundays and during @entity99			0
it was n't all bad though , there was a movement that declared a woman needed to ejaculate too in order for conception to be successful during sex , so emphasis was placed on women being able to orgasm			1
however , even where orgasms were involved , women were not allowed to admit to gaining any pleasure from it			1
unsurprisingly , contraception was n't easy during the 16th century , both because of laws and a lack of any scientific knowledge			0
although birth control was illegal , there were several methods used to stop pregnancy			0
according to the historical novelist @entity124 , wealthy men used condoms made from lamb 's gut , while women would insert either vinegar - soaked wool or pieces of wood into their vagina as a @entity134 - style diaphragm			1
@entity135 ( played by @entity136 ) had very few rights after @entity9 divorced her women 's rights in @entity13 , women had no legal rights and the law was used by men to limit all aspects of their freedom			1
it was illegal for women to have professional jobs in the law or teaching , or as doctors , which had the added effect of making them seem like a financial burden on a family			1
in the 16th century , women were owned by their father until they were married , when they then became the property of their husband			1
while they could inherit property , it was immediately passed over to their husbands if they married			1
very few women would have rallied against any of these restrictions as they were taught from a very young age that men were the superior sex			1
the only women who were seen of any use to the world were those who had given birth or were pregnant , as that was considered their only function in life			1
@entity32 's sister @entity173 ( played by @entity174 ) was badly used by the men in her family , who were rumoured to have offered her to the king to keep him entertained while her sister was pregnant according to the historian @entity124 , men were also legally allowed to beat their wives			1
she told @entity181 : ' if a husband disliked his wife â€™s behaviour he was permitted to beat her with a stick no broader than his thumb but not so violently as to kill her			2
' if a wife was deemed a nag she might be paraded about in public wearing an iron bridle , complete with a tongue - piece , to make speech impossible and humiliation certain			0
' education as women were n't allowed jobs , there was little need for a girl to be educated at school , which meant they were often illiterate for their whole lives			2
poor girls were usually put to use around the house doing menial chores from a very young age , but some richer families would hire a governess to teach skills that were considered feminine , like embroidery			0
in contrast , boys would be taught academic subjects like reading , writing and maths			0
@entity32 was unusual in that she was well educated and spoke @entity218 fluently as well as @entity73 childbirth giving birth was extremely dangerous in the 16th century , because of a lack of modern medicine and sterilised equipment			2
women often died during labour from complications that , today , would be easily overcome			2
one of the most common was puerperal fever , a septic infection that killed both @entity229 and @entity230 - two of @entity9 's wives			1
as well as being dangerous , childbirth was also extremely painful because pain relief was illegal			1
according to the historian @entity235 , who wrote in bed with @entity237 , one midwife was actually burned for using opium to help ease the pain of labours in 1591			2
dark blue and black were both colours worn by very rich men and women in the 16th century clothing getting dressed was an arduous affair in @entity13			2
@entity249 women wore several layers of ruffs , skirts and large amounts of padding under their gowns to achieve the fashionable boxy silhouette of the time			2
poorer women wore much simpler linen dresses with short sleeves			2
every woman wore their hair tied up under a cap			0
while the @entity237 were very relaxed about their bathing habits , their attitudes to cleanliness in their clothing was very different			0
whether rich or poor , every man and woman wore clean linens every day and the upper classes would sometimes change up to several times a day			0
the rich did n't just restrict themselves to linen either - new trade with @entity274 had opened up vast new areas of fashion , with different dyes and materials including silk , taffeta and damasks			0
married women hid their hair under a veil or cap , but the queen could wear it loose as she wore a crown but while there were plenty of new fabric colours to choose from , certain parts of society were only allowed to wear certain shades			2
new laws were passed during the tudor era that dictated what colour you could wear according to your class , so that it was clear how important you were			0
@entity299 was solely for royalty , black for extremely wealthy men and women , while yellow , russet and green was worn by the lower classes			2
for all these different restrictions on clothing , the one thing the @entity308 's were n't fussy about was underwear - women wore no pants , so they could easily go to the toilet			1
women who were not married were allowed to wear their hair loose , but as soon as you were married , it had to be tied away under a hood			0
the queen would occasionally be allowed to wear her hair loose because she wore a crown			0
life was tough for poor women as they were expected to run the entire household with no thanks housework women in @entity13 were extremely busy around the house			0
the basic chores that still apply for adults today , including cooking , washing clothes , cleaning and accounts were far more difficult without modern technology			0
but also , they were tasked with baking bread and brewing beer , as well as preserving fruits , pickling vegetables and curing meats because of the lack of refrigeration that keeps food from going off			0
she was also responsible for making soap and candles , spinning wool and linen and growing vegetables and herbs .			0

@entity2 's @entity3 has us salivating over beautiful clothes and jewellery
but @entity9 's court is far from the reality for normal women in the 1500s
husbands could beat wives and pain relief was banned during childbirth
