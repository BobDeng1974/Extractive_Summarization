by @entity0 @entity1 hesitated when asked if @entity4 ’s first @entity3 call - up in almost six years is a risk			1
his short answer was ‘ no ’ but his extended message to the gifted sale maverick — exiled from international rugby since 2008 after testing the patience of @entity11 once too often — was that the fly - half will be watched carefully when he arrives as part of an initial 20 - man squad for a training camp on sunday			1
@entity3 ’s head coach has invested too much into improving his squad ’s behaviour to allow one player , albeit one as prodigiously talented as @entity4 , to threaten their new and improved culture			1
video : scroll down to see @entity1 's views on @entity4 's @entity3 recall finding his way : @entity4 's return to form has earned him a recall to the @entity3 squad ready to grasp his opportunity : @entity4 insists he will take his chance with both hands ‘ i do n’t view it as a risk , ’ said @entity1			1
‘ it is an opportunity			0
ultimately , selection will be affected by how effective @entity4 is off the field in a training environment and his ability to apply his skills to our game plan			1
‘ if he ’s good enough he ’ll get the opportunity to go to @entity44 and if he ’s not quite ready he ’ll hopefully play in the @entity46 game ( at @entity47 on june 1 ) as the beginning of his return to international rugby			0
‘ i ’ve spoken to him in part ( about team culture ) but there will be a lot more when he comes into camp			0
i ’ll arrange a one - on - one with every player			0
@entity4 ’s might be a little bit longer			1
but of course he can train his way on to the plane			0
’ @entity4 ’s inclusion by no means guarantees him a place on the tour			1
he remains behind @entity66 ’ @entity67 , @entity69 ’s @entity68 and @entity71 ’s @entity70 in the pecking order			0
low risk : @entity3 head coach @entity1 says including @entity4 in his 20 - man squad is not a gamble but it is reward for consistent excellence for @entity79 this season and working with @entity82 ’s former mentor @entity81 to improve his off - field behaviour — last season ’s drunken run - in with a double decker bus was the last in a litany of misdemeanours			1
with @entity70 and @entity67 likely to be involved in the @entity91 final on may 31 and therefore forced to miss the opening @entity92 in @entity93 on june 7 , there is every chance the most talented @entity96 player of his generation could win a long overdue eighth cap			0
‘ i ’ve taken a lot of feedback from the coaching team at @entity79 and @entity102 and @entity103 are good judges of character and talent , ’ added @entity1			1
‘ i spoke to @entity4 ahead of the @entity107 and gave him some areas to work on and he ’s gone away and done that			2
recall : @entity4 has not featured on the international stage since 2008 ‘ i ’m persuaded to give him an opportunity			1
as with all players i will judge him on when they come into camp and how they behave when they ’re in it			0
‘ you have to earn the right — and i think @entity11 was the same — by playing well for your club and behaving on and off the field			0
‘ perhaps at that time that was n’t the case but i think it is now , so we have created this opportunity			0
’ @entity1 will name the final squad for the three - test tour on monday week			1
there was positive news about @entity129 ’ ankle yesterday but @entity3 are sure to be shorn of several key players			2
speaking out : @entity132 reckons it is ' ridiculous ' @entity3 are taking on @entity44 without all of their stars it is hard not to feel sympathy for the head coach , who played no part in the fixture scheduling — described by @entity3 flanker @entity132 as ‘ ridiculous ’ — which leaves the winners of this weekend ’s @entity91 semi-finals knowing they will have played themselves out of the tour			2
‘ it ’s hard to disagree with @entity132 and the way he articulated it , ’ said @entity1			2
‘ he , alongside everyone else , is frustrated by the situation			0
we get very few opportunities to go to a country like @entity44 and play against them and you want to go with you best side			0
’ whether @entity4 is part of that group remains to be seen .			2

@entity158 star has been included in @entity3 's initial 20 - man squad
@entity4 has been *absent* from the international stage since 2008
@entity1 plans to hold one - on - one talks with the fly - half about his *future*
