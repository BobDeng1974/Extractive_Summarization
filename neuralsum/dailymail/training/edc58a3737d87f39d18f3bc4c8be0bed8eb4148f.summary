by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity2 has vowed to reel in @entity3 for a second time in this season 's formula one world title battle after swallowing another bitter pill in @entity8			1
dicing with @entity3 for the lead of the @entity8 @entity10 , @entity2 was forced to retire after 47 laps with rear - brake failure sparked by the loss of the @entity14 ( energy recovery system )			1
although the ers in @entity3 's car also failed , the 28 - year - old went on to see the chequered flag , claiming second after being passed by @entity20 's debut winner @entity21 two laps from home			1
end of the road : @entity2 was forced to retire on lap 47 after suffering a mechanical problem @entity26 packed : the @entity27 had earlier gone side - by - side with @entity3 for the win - his team - mate finished 2nd it means @entity2 is now 22 points behind @entity3 , a crushing blow after previously clawing back a 25 - point deficit from the opening race in @entity36 where he retired and @entity3 triumphed			1
' i did the best i could out there and felt like i was having a strong race , but unfortunately it just was n't our day , ' said @entity2			1
' there was nothing i could do about our issues			0
we were managing the loss of power , but as soon as i finally made the jump on @entity3 in the second pit stop , my brakes failed			2
' there are no emotions other than i could n't believe my car stopped and the other did n't , but that 's the way it goes			0
on track : @entity2 insists he will bounce back after his setback in @entity8 listening in : the @entity27 is hoping to win his second @entity59 title this term ' two @entity61 ( did not finish ) is not helpful , but there 's a long , long way to go			2
i 've caught up before , so i 'll catch up again			0
' to not finish is disappointing , but there are plenty more races ahead of us this season so let 's hope for better fortune			0
' previously , @entity2 had to reel off four successive victories to finally edge ahead of @entity3 in the standings			1
given the performance of the @entity74 car , despite the gremlins on show at the @entity77 , @entity2 feels it may take something similarly special			2
' naturally , for the team , i do n't want either car not to finish so hopefully we do n't have any issues on either car for the rest of the year , ' added @entity2			0
' that obviously means i 'll have even more work to do to make up the lost ground , probably another four wins , and i 'll do what i can to get those			0
' we 've good tracks coming up , and the one for me is i make sure i win at @entity93 ( @entity94 @entity10 on july 6 )			0
