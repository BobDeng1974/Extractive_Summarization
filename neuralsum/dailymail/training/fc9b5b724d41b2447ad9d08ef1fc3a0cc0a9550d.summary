when @entity3 supporters took to social media with the hashtag # @entity5 this weekend , their aim was to express their support for prime minister @entity8 ahead of a possible leadership spill			1
however the tag was quickly hijacked by others , who used it to highlight the mistakes and broken promises of mr @entity8 and the government			2
the top trend in @entity18 on both saturday and sunday , the hashtag has maintained momentum as more and more people voice their opinions			2
the ' i 'm sticking with @entity8 ' sentiment was sparked by a @entity25 post written by @entity3 backbencher @entity26 , who listed all the reasons he would be standing by the prime minister			1
' therefore , even if he 'd given a knighthood to @entity31 â€“ i 'm sticking with @entity32 ! ! ' the post ends			0
' # @entity36 because he gives my wife no excuse not to do the ironing ' , @entity53 wrote			2
' @entity58 until we find the suppository of all wisdom ' , another user @entity57 joked			0
mr @entity8 's position as minister for women was also raised by many social media users , as was his @entity65 and even his speech delivery technique			1
but the hashtag was quickly hijacked by those making fun of the prime minister social media users took the @entity72 with jokes , angering @entity3 supporters who came up with the tag some criticised his speech giving abilities others pointed out some of his opinions they did n't agree with @entity53 made this joke about mr @entity8 being the minister for women ' # @entity83 because he 's made saying the same thing twice , saying the same thing twice , cool again			1
he 's made it cool again ' , @entity86 wrote			0
despite the jokes @entity3 supporters did jump to the defence of mr @entity8 , commending him on his achievements as leader , the @entity50 voices seemed louder			1
this is just the latest in a series of gaffes which have left the prime minister red - faced and having to defend his position			1
most recent was mr @entity8 's decision to award a knighthood to @entity100 , dubbed a ' knightmare ' and widely ridiculed even within his own party			0
branded a ' stuff - up ' by even the most conservative media commentators , the prime minister 's decision to knight the @entity105 was very poorly received			1
mr @entity8 's declaration that he would shirtfront president @entity109 at an upcoming @entity111 meeting was another of his widely criticised moves			1
when mr @entity8 , live on @entity114 , winked after hearing the caller on had to work on a phone - sex line to make ends meet is another example of what some called poor judgement			0
in a wink of an eye , @entity8 became an internet sensation for his response to the phone - sex worker who called @entity114 talkback radio to complain about rising costs			1
caught on camera winking to host @entity130 before addressing the caller 's concerns , @entity8 earned the title ' creep ' on social media			1
in @entity8 's defence it was radio , although he appeared to have forgotten an important rule of politics - someone is always watching			0
the unfortunate gaffe which saw him declare he was not the ' suppository of all wisdom ' was delivered to a room of @entity3 faithfuls during the 2013 election campaign			2
in a wink of an eye , @entity8 became an internet sensation for his response to the phone - sex worker who called @entity114 talkback radio to complain about rising costs ' no one , however smart , however well - educated , however well experienced , is the suppository of all wisdom , ' mr @entity8 declared			1
what he probably meant was repository			0
the linguistic fumble resulted in honorary website thesuppositroyofallwisdom.com , created purely to spit out @entity8 quotes			0
just one day after the suppository mix - up , @entity8 relied on an interesting quality to link @entity162 , then @entity3 candidate for the western @entity165 seat @entity166 , and her predecessor @entity167			2
he told media they both had ' a bit of sex appeal '			2
@entity8 played it down as exuberance and later dubbed it a daggy dad moment			0
then , in the final days of the 2013 election campaign , @entity8 made a last - ditch plea to voters via the cast of reality show @entity180			0
in a message to housemates , @entity8 told them to vote for the ' guy with the not - bad - looking daughters '			0
it might have helped him get elected , but when you 're prime minister relying on the looks of your daughters probably wo n't cut it			1
years before @entity8 took the title of prime minister , a somewhat insensitive comment in @entity193 landed the then opposition leader in hot water			1
while talking to soldiers about the loss of their comrade , @entity8 said sometimes s * * * happens			0
the gaffe was compounded in a subsequent interview when @entity8 was asked to explain the comments			0
his reaction of 24 awkward seconds of silence made for compelling viewing .			0

the hashtag # @entity83 gained momentum across the weekend
it was hijacked by social media users making fun of the prime minister
some @entity3 supporters did jump to his defence
we *reveal* his most *memorable* gaffes from winking to a sex worker to *vowing* to shirtfront @entity109
