the tiniest flaws in software can enable cyber criminals to hack your bank account or take control of your phone or computer			1
now @entity8 has issued an ultimatum to its rivals - including @entity11 and @entity12 - telling them to patch their software vulnerabilities , or it will make them public within 90 days			1
the search giant ’s move has ruffled feathers , but @entity8 claims it is designed to protect consumers from fast - moving cyber criminals and president @entity20 is calling for a collaborative response			1
@entity8 has issued an ultimatum to its rivals , telling them to patch their software vulnerabilities , or it will make them public within 90 days , it has been reported			1
the company 's logo is shown the @entity31 based company assembled a crack team of hackers and programmers called @entity35 in july to trawl its own – and its competitors – software for security flaws and give companies a deadline to fix them , @entity36 reported			1
but some critics claim that ’s a job for a neutral body			0
for example , @entity46 , a principal with software security company @entity47 in @entity48 said : ‘ i ’m not sure who made @entity8 the official referee of the marketplace for vulnerability notification			1
he added that pressuring companies to fix flaws is a good idea , but ‘ what noble motives they [ @entity8 ] had in mind could be called into question given the fact that they essentially outed vulnerabilities for two of their biggest rivals			1
’ tomorrow , president @entity20 will visit @entity8 to call on companies to work together and share information to thwart cyber crooks			1
@entity8 's @entity35 team 's intention is to protect consumers from fast - moving cyber criminals ( illustrated witha stock image ) by pressuring software providers to fix flaws quickly @entity8 ’s crack team of hackers and researchers were assembled in july after the @entity82 bug hit the headlines			1
a blog post announcing the team , says : ‘ you should be able to use the web without fear that a criminal or state - sponsored actor is exploiting software bugs to infect your computer , steal secrets or monitor your communications			2
‘ our objective is to significantly reduce the number of people harmed by targeted attacks			0
’ analysis suggests that the project so far has identified 39 vulnerabilities in @entity12 software and 20 in @entity11 software as well as 37 in @entity105 products			0
last year , it took firms an average of 205 days to learn hackers had infiltrated their networks , cybersecurity firm @entity111 said			0
@entity113 , a senior security researcher with @entity114 , said that it may be hard for large companies to create a fix within 90 days , but sometimes a flaw is neglected for years			1
he said that so far , flaws published by @entity35 have not been serious			0
but many experts are wondering how an industry - wide programme could work , given that the major players are struggling to work together			0
@entity124 has approached @entity11 and @entity12 for comment , with @entity11 pointing towards a blog post written in january for its response			0
opponents of @entity8 ’s @entity35 say it could damage online security by pointing out flaws before they are fixed , effectively drawing cyber criminals ' attention to code to exploit			1
an anonymous source told @entity36 that @entity12 begged @entity8 not to publicise three flaws in the @entity136 operating system in january			1
the search giant reportedly went ahead , despite knowing a fix was on its way from @entity12			0
similarly , @entity11 revealed it asked for two extra days to fix a @entity142 flaw , but @entity8 publicised the bug			2
@entity144 , senior director of @entity11 ’s @entity145 , wrote in a blog post in january : ‘ the decision feels less like principles and more like a “ gotcha , ” with customers the ones who may suffer as a result			0
’ ‘ what ’s right for @entity8 is not always right for customers			2
we urge @entity8 to make protection of customers our collective primary goal			2
‘ @entity11 argues that it ’s best for researchers to privately tell software providers about software flaws so a fix can be developed before the problem is widely known about			1
mr @entity144 wrote : ‘ those in favour of full , public disclosure believe that this method pushes software vendors to fix vulnerabilities more quickly and makes customers develop and take actions to protect themselves			2
‘ releasing information absent context or a stated path to further protections , unduly pressures an already complicated technical environment			0
@entity11 revealed it asked for two extra days to fix a @entity142 flaw , but @entity8 publicised the bug			2
a stock image of the operating system is shown			0
@entity144 , of @entity11 wrote in a blog post : ‘ the decision feels less like principles and more like a “ gotcha , ” with customers the ones who may suffer as a result ’ ‘ it is necessary to fully assess the potential vulnerability , design and evaluate against the broader threat landscape , and issue a “ fix ” before it is disclosed to the public , including those who would use the vulnerability to orchestrate an attack			0
we are in this latter camp			0
’ mr @entity144 said that @entity11 believes in coordinated vulnerability disclosure ( @entity199 )			0
‘ this is a time for security researchers and software companies to come together and not stand divided over important protection strategies , such as the disclosure of vulnerabilities and the remediation of them. , ’ he said			1
‘ policies and approaches that limit or ignore that partnership do not benefit the researchers , the software vendors , or our customers			0
it is a zero sum game where all parties end up injured			0
’ @entity8 ’s supporters say its approach could lead to fixes being developed more quickly and @entity220 , a manager with @entity221 in @entity222 says it ’s good for the industry			2
‘ if we have huge companies like @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity8 going at each other and pushing for better security , it ’s a win across the board , ’ he said .			1

@entity8 claims its move is designed to protect consumers from criminals
but software providers are not happy with the threat to expose problems
opponents say strategy could damage online security and help crooks
tomorrow , president @entity20 will visit @entity8 to call on companies to work together and share information to thwart cyber crooks
