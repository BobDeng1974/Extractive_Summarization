@entity1 land , dams with no water reaching them , boats anchored in dried - up reservoirs and shrinking lake levels			1
these extraordinary images show the devastating impact the worst droughts in decades is having on the @entity10 - and forecasters have predicted it is likely to continue			1
around 430,000 acres of land will be left fallow in @entity13 - because there has n't been enough rain or snow coming from the nearby mountain ranges			1
farmers - who are daily facing the prospect of losing their jobs and everything they have - are hoping for relief this winter , but the situation still remains dire			0
the images , taken from the october issue of @entity26 , show boats in a reservoir in @entity29 north of @entity30 , @entity13 , bunched together because the water levels were so low			1
forecasters have predicted that it is set to continue until the end of the year and possibly beyond in early 2014 no water had reached the @entity43 ( pictured in @entity26 ) that lies on the @entity44 in @entity45			1
as of thursday , 81 per cent of the state had severe drought conditions they also capture the water levels in @entity50 , @entity13 , which are 65 per cent below the historic average and the @entity52 on the @entity44 in @entity45 , which had collected no water in early 2014			1
in august , officials in @entity50 put @entity55 in place for the area because of the reduced levels			0
the drought crisis in @entity13 is so bad that some residents are now stealing water out of fire hydrants			1
in the western @entity64 , most water arrives in winter storms , which swoop in from the @entity66 and dump snow atop the region â€™s mountain ranges			2
to catch this water , @entity70 have built dams , but the lack of snow simply means they are stopping anything			2
a growing population that requires more water to be taken from the vast system of is also worsening the situation			0
one that has required a massive increase is @entity82 , @entity83 , which has seen its number of residents grow four-fold since 1970			0
today forecasters have predicted the severe drought or worse will continue into next year across much of the @entity10 , including parts of western @entity89 , most of @entity45 and practically all of @entity13			1

picture taken for @entity26 @entity104 in @entity82 , @entity83 , pictured in @entity26 - the population of which has grown four-fold since 1970 - uses a 336 - mile - long system of canals and pipelines to carry water from the @entity110 through the desert below - normal precipitation and normal or above - normal temperatures are forecast in the week ahead , according to the @entity114 , and experts say the three - year drought is n't likely to be relieved in october , november and december			1

officials say @entity123 is close to dropping to its natural rim for the first time since october 2009			0
as of thursday , 81 percent of @entity45 had severe drought conditions or worse			2
that was a slight improvement from the 87 percent in that category three months ago , but it was up from 78 percent the beginning of the year			0
the occurrence has been well documented recently with a series of striking images published last month which showed massive drops in water levels across the @entity10 's waterways between 2011 and 2014			0
the above five images all feature in a special report in october 's edition of @entity26 ( left ) on the drought in the @entity10 , which has also hit @entity143 in @entity13 ( right ) bridges span a dry inlet of @entity50 in @entity146 , @entity13			1

here , the @entity155 spans the @entity29 in @entity156 , @entity13 in july 2011			0
after : here , the @entity155 spans the same reservoir , which has dwindled to a mere trickle in 2014 as @entity13 is forced to draw alarming amounts of water from its vanishing reservoirs before : @entity29 is shown in july 2011 in all of its lush glory at 97 per cent capacity after : the parched lake is shown last month at near record - low capacity boats used to have more space to spread out on the lake but now they risk being left high and dry nothing to hold back : at left , @entity169 holds back a reservoir brimming with water in july 2011 , while the same dam holds little but air at right in 2014 staggering : water has all but disappeared from some part of the lake as water levels have dropped more than 50 feet meanwhile , hundreds of domestic wells in @entity13 's drought - parched @entity181 farming region have run dry , leaving many residents to rely on donated bottles of drinking water to get by			1
@entity185 have set up collection points while local charities are searching for money to install tanks next to homes			0
officials are trucking in water for those families in greatest need and have put a large tank in front of the local firehouse for residents to fill up with water for bathing and flushing toilets			2
about 290 families in @entity204 - a poor , largely @entity206 town of about 7,000 residents nestled against the @entity45 foothills - have said their shallow wells are depleted			1
officials say the rest of @entity212 has many more empty wells , but nobody has a precise count			0

@entity234 draws water out of the pool at @entity238 's @entity237 in @entity204 , @entity13			1
the resort is offering the residents pool water to flush toilets and for other non-potable uses lawmakers in @entity30 passed legislation to regulate groundwater pumping , which governor @entity246 signed into law this past week			0
three days later , @entity246 signed an executive order that provides money to buy drinking water for residents statewide whose wells have dried up , while also directing key state officials to work with counties and local agencies to find solutions for the shortages			1
the @entity258 had already allotted $ 500,000 to buy bottled water for @entity204 residents , said @entity261 of the board 's @entity262			1
but many @entity204 residents , like ms @entity225 , say all they want is to get a glass of water from the kitchen sink			1
her well dried up nearly two months ago , she said , making life challenging for her husband and three children			0
@entity238 's @entity237 manager @entity272 discusses her concerns about the drought , while the park 's pool remains open so locals can use it as a non-potable water source to bathe , they each have to fill a bucket from a 300 - gallon tank in the front yard , carry it inside and pour water over their heads with a cup			2
they 've lived in their home for 21 years , she said			0

typically , river water permeates the sandy soil under the community , filling up wells as shallow as 30 feet deep			0
however , drought this year has caused the river to run dry along with the wells			1
@entity212 spokeswoman @entity303 said @entity204 needs to get connected to the nearest water main in neighboring @entity204			2
she said that could cost more than $ 20 million and take up to five years - if the project did n't hit political snags			0
she added counting the number of dry wells is difficult because people do n't come forward fearing their children will be taken away if their home lacks a safe water source , or they believe that their home would be condemned , making them homeless			2
officials have had to combat these rumors , she said , adding , ' we 're blindly feeling our way through this			0
