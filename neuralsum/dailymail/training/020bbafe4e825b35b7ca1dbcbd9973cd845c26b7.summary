drinking three pints of beer – or three medium - sized glasses of wine – once a week permanently dulls the brain , according to a study			1
researchers discovered that regular drinkers have to use almost 20 per cent more brain - power than normal to carry out simple tasks and find it progressively more difficult to concentrate			0
the three - year study at the @entity11 in @entity12 compared 26 ‘ binge - drinking ’ students – those who regularly drank a minimum of six units of alcohol , or around three pints , in one sitting at least once a week – with 31 others who did not regularly drink as much			1
mine 's a pint : @entity20 showed that heavy drinkers ' brains had to work harder to achieve the same result as those who do not regularly drink later , when sober , the students were asked to react to different flashing symbols			1
there was no measurable difference in speed or accuracy of response between the two groups , and no deterioration over time			0
however , brain - power measurements showed that ‘ binge - drinkers ’ had to work harder to achieve the same result			2
risks : drinking beer regularly permanently dulls brain function with the more sober group , peak brain activity stayed at about 18 microvolts while the drinkers started at 20 microvolts in their first year and went up to 22 microvolts in their third year			1
it suggests that young drinkers ‘ experience anomalies in neural activity ’ involved with attention and working memory , the researchers wrote in the journal @entity45			2
@entity50 , director of the campaign group @entity51 , said : ‘ this shows why we need to change the culture where it ’s seen as the norm to drink excessively at university			0
risk : too many alcoholic drinks can affect concentration as well as organ function ‘ binge - drinking carries lots of risks in terms of the immediate safety of students , but also in terms of their future health and the likelihood of developing an alcohol problem later in life			2
’ but @entity75 , of @entity74 , said : ‘ learning at university is not limited to the classroom			0
' while having a few drinks on a regular basis may dull your senses slightly , the gains far outweigh the disadvantages			0

drinking beer and wine regularly permanently *inhibits* concentration
@entity20 showed that binge drinking affected both attention and memory
