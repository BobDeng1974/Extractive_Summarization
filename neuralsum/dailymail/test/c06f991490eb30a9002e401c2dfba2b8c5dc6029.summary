@entity0 feels he may have handed @entity1 a psychological advantage with his post-chinese @entity4 outburst			1
@entity0 , however , concedes he would not do anything differently under the circumstances that materialised at the @entity7 on sunday			1
to make a complaint about @entity1 's slow driving was understandable given the situation , but to turn on his @entity12 team - mate during the post-race media conference was a sign the @entity15 has got under @entity0 's skin			1
@entity0 has claimed that team - mate @entity1 has the mental edge over him after his outburst @entity19 , the 1996 world champion , upon hearing @entity0 's comments remarked the @entity21 had shot himself in the foot by publicly airing his grievances			1
it was a sign of weakness from @entity0 , who on thursday conceded he had probably provided @entity1 with additional psychological ammunition			1
' maybe , because i 'm standing here and i have to answer all these questions , ' said @entity0 in the middle of a barrage from the press ahead of this weekend 's @entity33			1
' but other than that , i would do it again because i felt the need to state the facts as there was a need to discuss things after that race			2
' that 's it , i would n't do anything different , and except from being stood here in this room discussing it with you , it 's a long time since i last discussed it			2
' it 's a thing of the past			0
i 'm in @entity53 now and i 'm here just to attack in a race car again			0
' that 's the best answer i can give , on the race track			0
i 'm looking forward to it and that opportunity			0
' the @entity60 driver won the @entity61 gp but came under fire from @entity0 for allegedly slowing on purpose the matter was resolved in a post-race debrief involving the drivers and the team 's top brass in motorsport boss @entity69 and executive technical director @entity70			1
but as to what would transpire should the same scenario occur again in the future , @entity0 said : ' it 's so difficult because it 's not a thing that 's black or white			1
' that 's what makes all these scenarios difficult			0
eventually , once the facts are analysed , there are still different opinions and it 's going to be different from one race to the next			0
' such a situation could become even more fluid should @entity86 manage to exert further pressure on @entity12 as the title race unfolds			0
asked as to what the solution could be moving forward , the 29 - year - old replied : ' it 's always the same and it will not change			0
@entity19 believes that @entity0 shot himself in the foot following his outburst about his @entity12 team - mate ' it 's an agreement we have when the team 's one - two is under threat from another team then some management will be used to ensure that , and that might be at the disadvantage of one over the other			2
' it becomes a team effort because we want to finish one - two and score the most possible points			0
' so the more annoying a @entity86 becomes , the more likely those measures will be used - just like in @entity61 when @entity1 was told to speed up			1
' @entity1 was publicly exonerated of any wrongdoing by @entity69 and non-executive chairman @entity112 as he was merely controlling his pace at a point in the race when he was required to nurse his tyres			2
for his part , @entity1 has remained unruffled by @entity0 's comments , and does not feel there is any lingering animosity			1
' we 're moving forwards and we will reunite as a team this weekend and try to do a great job , ' said @entity1			2
@entity0 is yet to better @entity1 this season but insists he 's already forgotten about their recent spat ' there 's no issue between me and @entity0			1
we saw each other this morning and everything is good			0
' there are going to be times when people are unhappy about some things , but we 're grown - ups and we move past it			2
' there is no doubt @entity1 has @entity0 rattled as the former has now beaten the latter in nine of the last 10 races stretching back into last year			1
@entity0 knows he has to stop the rot , adding : ' it was very important to do that in @entity146 , and that was two races back , so that does n't change			2
' every race is important , and he 's 17 points ahead , so i need to get points back as soon as possible			0
that 's clear , and it 's not more important here or wherever			0
' last year he had a run of four wins at the beginning of the season , and right after that i had my best part of the year for quite a long time , so there 's also that reference from last year			0

@entity0 reckons @entity1 has the psychological advantage
@entity0 was unhappy with the @entity60 driver after the @entity61 gp
however , the @entity21 insists that the *disagreement* is all forgotten
