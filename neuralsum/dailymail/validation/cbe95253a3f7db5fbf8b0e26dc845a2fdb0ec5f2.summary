an epileptic hospital patient was forced to sleep on the floor for four weeks while he was waiting to have a scan on his brain			1
@entity4 was kept in a receiving ward , normally for short stays of no more than two days , after being admitted to the @entity7 in @entity8			1
he hit his head during an epileptic seizure , making him prone to violent outbursts - so hospital staff removed his bed from the room and made him sleep on a mattress on the floor			1
it took three weeks before mr @entity4 , 54 , was given a chair , and though he has now moved to another hospital he is still waiting for an mri scan six weeks after the accident			1
hospital : @entity4 had to spend four weeks in a room without a bed while waiting for a scan relatives of the former roofer , from @entity8 , are desperate to find out what is wrong with him , but until he has the scan - which will take around 45 minutes - they are still in the dark			1
his partner @entity31 , 50 , said : ' we took him to @entity33 at the @entity34 and he was kept in overnight			2
' he had another fit the next morning so they kept him in for another few days			1
but a couple of days later he walked out of the hospital at 3.30am			1
' he threw all his medication away and walked out dressed only in his slippers , pyjamas and housecoat			0
' clearly , mentally he was not right			0
before he banged his head he was fine			2
he had no mental health issues whatsoever			0
' precaution : mr @entity4 had to sleep on a mattress on the floor after he behaved violently waiting : he did not even get a chair in the room for his first three weeks in hospital ms @entity31 initially took mr @entity4 to the @entity49 after he hit his head , and was then referred to @entity33			1
' we waited seven hours in casualty , ' she said			0
' then he was put in a receiving ward			0
you are supposed to be there for a maximum of two days			0
' he was supposed to be going to the @entity57 to get an mri scan and a lumbar puncture but they cancelled his appointments three times			2
' they 're sedating him because of his outburst in the waiting room but he 's not that kind of man			2
it 's terrible to see him like this			0
' i know there is something wrong with his brain			0
if they would just give him the scan we could find out what is the matter with him			2
' i thought they would at least have given him a bed with cot sides so he could n't get out or do himself an injury			2
@entity33 : mr @entity4 spent four weeks at the @entity82 , pictured , before moving to another hospital ' when he went in at first he was quite violent , throwing things about , so they took everything out of his room			1
' he keeps going back to when he was a boy and still thinks his mum and dad are alive			0
' ms @entity31 praised the way doctors and nurses looked after mr @entity4 before he was moved to the @entity93 , but criticised the @entity94 for failing to treat him promptly			1
a spokesman for @entity8 and @entity96 said : ' the patient presented with extremely challenging behaviour and for his own protection and personal safety had to be nursed with only a mattress in his room			1
' we accept there were delays in transferring him to the @entity93			0
we also accept a delay in providing the appropriate tests which need to be undertaken with specialist clinical input			0
' these have now been arranged to be undertaken this week			0

@entity4 hit his head during a fit and was admitted to hospital
he started behaving violently so had his bed taken away and *replaced* with a mattress on the floor
mr @entity4 , 54 , has now moved hospitals but is still waiting for @entity120 scan
in the *meantime* relatives have no *explanation* for his erratic behaviour
