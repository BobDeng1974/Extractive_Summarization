@entity1 has escaped in a state - of - the - art armoured vehicle provided by @entity4 , it emerged today			1
in the latest extraordinary twist to the @entity8 rebellion , it emerged that the @entity10 president gave the ‘ green light ’ to the @entity12 dictator receiving the £ 3.5 million converted @entity13 in 2008			1
not only is it filled with communications systems capable of keeping @entity1 in touch with his forces , but it can foil the kind of tracking systems used by the military as they try to hunt him down			1
stealthy and bulletproof : a road - going @entity24 , the type which has been modified with armour plating and jamming technology , and allegedly given to @entity1 by @entity10 it was mr @entity4 who ordered @entity10 jets to start bombing @entity1 ’s forces back in march , and last week he and prime minister @entity33 enjoyed a triumphant trip to the newly liberated @entity35			1
but investigative news site @entity36 has found documents proving that @entity10 technology firm @entity39 was allowed to provide @entity1 with the command vehicle			1
the revelation comes on the day that @entity43 fighters fired anti-aircraft guns at revolutionary forces holding the northern gate of @entity47 for a second day , as frustration with weeks of halting advances grows among the former rebel ranks			1
launching an attack : @entity8 rebel fighters fire rockets as they press forward near @entity54 in the outskirts of @entity56			1
a second front has reportedly opened up in the city 's east weapons salvage : anti-gaddafi forces sift through the abandoned weapons in @entity56 , taking what they can use and destroying everything left behind			1
fighting remains fierce in @entity1 's remaining strongholds @entity68 front line : revolutionary forces have pulled back from @entity47 , leaving a thin front of mainly young fighters with little experience or support forces - no longer rebels but the military of the @entity77 , @entity8 's interim government - have been massed outside @entity47 since shortly after @entity8 's new rulers gained control of @entity35 and other parts of the country in august			1
block - by - block fighting continues in @entity1 's home town of @entity56 , with revolutionary forces claiming to have opened a second front in the east of the city			1
of @entity4 's armoured 4x4 , @entity36 says : ‘ in 2007 the sale was approved by the then interior minister , @entity4 , and his chief of staff @entity91			2
@entity1 spokesman @entity93 has told the @entity96 @entity95 tv station , the @entity1 media mouthpiece , that 17 mercenaries from @entity99 , @entity10 and @entity100 had been captured near @entity47			1
@entity99 's @entity101 said it was aware of mr @entity93 's claims , but had no evidence that they were correct			2
mr @entity93 said : ' a group was captured in @entity47 consisting of 17 mercenaries			1
they are technical experts and they include consultative officers			2
most of them are @entity10 , one of them is from an @entity113 country that has not been identified , two @entity115 people and one @entity100			2
' the @entity10 foreign ministry said it had no information about the report			2
@entity100 officials were not immediately available for comment			2
‘ the vehicle was eventually delivered in 2008 - this time with the green light from the president			2
’ the site goes on to give details of the armoured @entity126 - equipped with a protection cage made by @entity128 , which prevents all electronic fields from affecting the vehicle			2
it also comes with an electronic device capable of knocking out all radio frequencies within some 300ft of the vehicle			2
this would make the kind of targeted bombing , which has seen hundreds of @entity140 vehicles destroyed over the past six months , almost impossible			0
a military source in @entity142 said : ‘ @entity1 has almost certainly used the vehicle to get away			0
it is a product of superb @entity10 engineering , and an obvious means of escape			0
‘ @entity1 would be able to stay out sight of military targeters , and be extremely well protected if he met enemy forces on the ground			0
’ in a further disastrous revelation for mr @entity4 , it emerged that the @entity153 was part of a £ 25million - plus deal that also saw the @entity10 provide @entity8 with the means to conduct email surveillance over their own people			0
the deal was put together by the @entity10 - @entity161 arms dealer @entity160 , which is at the centre of a party - funding scandal involving mr @entity4			0
the scandal , known in @entity10 as ‘ @entity166 ’ , is linked to the selling of submarines to @entity169			0
the unidentified military source added : ‘ all of this is disastrous for mr @entity4			0
on one hand he is presenting himself as the saviour of @entity8 , while in reality he did more to keep @entity1 in arms than almost anybody else			0
’ @entity178 disaster : revelations that @entity4 essentially gave @entity1 the means of his escape from capture will be a major embarrassment for the @entity10 president			0
both men are seen here in a 2007 photo sherpa , a @entity10 internet watchdog group , last week filed a complaint against @entity39 for selling equipment to @entity1 designed ‘ to track rebel forces ’			0
an @entity194 spokesman said : ‘ we have no comment to make on any of this			0
’ today trained fighters pulled away from @entity47 to regroup and reinforce for a new assault , after they were heavily beaten in the city friday			1
@entity1 forces opened up on the bands of ragtag , undisciplined fighters left on on the front line			1
these include fighters as young as 18 who spend hours smoking hash , shooting at plastic bottles , arguing with one another and sometimes just firing wildly into the streets out of apparent boredom			1
slow but steady progress : anti-gaddafi fighters advance to bomb an area where they exchange fire with @entity216 near @entity217 , 32 miles east of @entity56 @entity218 is in the air : as @entity8 fighters chant slogans , after taking control of @entity1 strongholds in the desert south of @entity35 , there remains the feeling that revolutionary forces will slowly but surely triumph fighting is raging at @entity56 , @entity1 's hometown on the @entity230 coast			1
the regime stronghold of @entity232 lies hundreds of miles away in the southern deserts , and there are others deep in the central deserts like the cities of @entity239 and @entity240			0
revolutionaries involved in the battle at @entity56 are more organised but have have made slow progress			0
today revolutionary forces shelled the city with grad rockets and the sound of gunfights echoed through the streets			0
white smoke wafted over the city , and civilians continued to flee			0
@entity1 forces answered back with occasional katyusha rockets			0
regular truckloads of fuel and food arrive from @entity256 to keep the fighters supplied outside @entity56			1
in the past three days , they have battled block - by - block into the western side of @entity56 , along the beach and along a eucalyptus tree - lined main avenue parallel to the coast .			0
