by @entity1 reporter published : 10:53 est , 31 may 2013 updated : 10:53 est , 31 may 2013 these breathtaking photos show groups of hikers who really are n't afraid of living on the edge			2
they are standing on a well - known spot called @entity8 in @entity9 - which is located in southern @entity10 and is named so because of its bizarre shape			1
as they pose for the unique souvenir photos , the pranksters are dwarfed by the immense scale and beauty of the @entity17 landscape arrayed before them			0
watch your step ! hikers are photographed at the moment they leap in the air as they stand on the well - known @entity24 in southern @entity10 much safer to stay glued to the deck : this picture taken from a different angle shows the dramatic landscape arrayed 1,150ft below @entity29 do n't slip on the ice : a daredevil tests his luck on the outcrop even as it is covered in snow in the harsh @entity36 winter better safe than sorry : this adventurous visitor has taken the sensible decision to wriggle to the edge on his belly before peering over to the steep drop below all together now : local guide @entity42 has been taking photos of tourists he 's taken to the scenic spot for the past four years it 's a long way down : imagine emerging from your tent and having a cup of coffee with this view fearless : another visitor tempts fate by sitting right on the edge of @entity29 each photo features hikers striking a pose with a stunning view of the @entity10 fjords in the background			1
but only those with brave hearts have the courage to stand or sit on the edge of this outcrop , which sticks out into space 1,150ft above the cold waters below			1
the incredible images were taken by hiking guide @entity42 , who has been taking photos of tourists he 's taken to the scenic spot for the past four years			1
' since 2009 , we have arranged guided hikes to @entity29 , ' he said			0
on the top we arrange a photo shoot , and take pictures of the participants posing on the @entity29			0
' it seems like the groups then challenge and inspire each other to come up with better or funnier pictures			0
' be nice ! a visitor pretends to be about to boot her friend off the outcrop in this picture no safety net : a montage picture shows a man making a dangerous acrobatic leap on the @entity29 no fear : if he jumps too far this martial arts enthusiast will by fly kicking rather longer than he had expected what are friends for ? this visitor looks ready to dive off to the distant fjord below - with her pal in standby in case she has second thoughts very spiritual : one false move and this man doing the tree will be taking @entity108 flying to a whole new level @entity110 : what is he trying to do ? break the thing ? time for romance : mr @entity42 says he has even captured pictures of a wedding proposal in the dramatic spot @entity117 ! two hikers raise their hands in an apparent victory pose as they stand near the edge jumping for joy : three happy hikers click their heels @entity126 style after reaching @entity29 , which is an eight to ten hour trek from the nearest town mr @entity42 , 42 , has even captured a wedding proposal on the rocky outcrop			1
' the tourist track to @entity29 starts in @entity133 and it usually takes 8 - 10 hours to do this hike , most people do this hike without a guide , ' he added			2
' i really like the photos where big groups of people are jumping and you capture the perfect moment mid-air			0
' it 's a shame sometimes that it 's so cloudy because when it 's blue sky its absolutely beautiful			0
