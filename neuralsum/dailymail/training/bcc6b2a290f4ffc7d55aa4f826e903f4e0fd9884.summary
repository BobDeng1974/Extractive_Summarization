@entity0 could undergo devastating increases in temperature , rainfall and sea level as a result of global warming			1
this is according to a @entity9 - backed report which predicts annual temperatures will increase 4.1 ° f to 5.7 ° f by the 2050s and 5.3 ° f to 8.8 ° f by the 2080s			1
the frequency of heat waves is set rise to two per year in the 1980s to roughly six per year by the 2080s			1
future 100 - year flood zones for @entity0			1
large areas of @entity20 ( shown in light green ) will be hit by floods in the 2020s , while areas of @entity25 and the @entity26 ( yellow ) will face the same fate in the 2050s			1
the purple shows the high - risk zones in @entity0 the predictions have been made by the @entity32 on @entity33 ( @entity34 ) 2015 , which is co-chaired by @entity9 researcher , @entity35			1
while @entity0 summers will get even hotter , rainfall will increase four to 11 per cent by the 2050s and five to 13 per cent by the 2080s , the report predicts			1
sea levels have already risen in @entity0 1.1ft ( 0.3 metres ) since 1900			1
that is almost twice the observed global rate of 0.5 to 0.7 inches per decade			0
' as was demonstrated by @entity50 , populations living in coastal and low - lying areas , the elderly and very young , and lower - income neighborhoods are highly vulnerable , ' the report said			1
pictured are observed and projected temperature in @entity0			1
the frequency of heat waves is set rise to two per year in the 1980s to roughly six per year by the 2080s , according to the report map of annual temperature changes in the @entity58 in 2050			1
in @entity0 , @entity9 predicts annual temperatures will increase 4.1 ° f to 5.7 ° f by the 2050s and 5.3 ° f to 8.8 ° f by the 2080s - mean annual temperature has increased a total of 3.4 ° f from 1900 to 2013			1
- @entity64 mean annual temperatures are projected to increase 4.1 to 5.7 ° f by the 2050s and 5.3 to 8.8 ° f by the 2080s , relative to the 1980s base period			1
- the frequency of heat waves is projected to increase from 2 per year in the 1980s to roughly six per year by the 2080s			1
- mean annual precipitation has increased by a total of 8 inches from 1900 to 2013			0
- @entity64 mean annual precipitation is projected to increase 4 to 11 percent by the 2050s and five to 13 per cent by the 2080s , relative to the 1980s base period			1
- sea levels have risen in @entity0 1.1 feet since 1900			1
that is almost twice the observed global rate of 0.5 to 0.7 inches per decade over a similar time period			0
- projections for sea level rise in @entity0 increase from 11 inches to 21 inches by the 2050s , 18 inches to 39 inches by the 2080s , and , 22 inches to 50 inches , with the worst case of up to six feet , by 2100			1
the group has created a map which reveals how large areas of @entity20 will be hit by floods in the 2020s , while areas of @entity25 and the @entity26 will face the same fate in the 2050s			1
coastal areas of @entity94 and @entity95 will be battling high tides as sea level rises 10 inches in as little as five years , the report claims			2
projections for sea level rise in @entity0 will increase from 11 inches to 21 inches by the 2050s , 18 inches to 39 inches by the 2080s , and , 22 inches to 50 inches			1
in the worst case , sea levels will rise by up to six feet ( 1.8 metres ) , by 2100			0
' climate change research is n't just something for the future , ' said @entity35			0
' it 's affecting how key policy decisions are being made now			0
' the report also uses @entity109 7 data to map the surface temperature of mid-town @entity95 and show the cooling effect of @entity113 the report follows a separate study earlier this week which found the western @entity115 will face increasingly severe mega-droughts later this century			2
since the year 2000 , seven western states in the @entity115 has seen their driest periods in centuries			2
these states are @entity121 , @entity122 , @entity123 , @entity124 , @entity125 , @entity126 and @entity127 and scientists in @entity122 have warned that the region may be experiencing a century - long ' mega-drought '			0
the warnings came after sediment studies showed @entity122 is currently experiencing the driest spell since 1580 , and that the regular rainfall seen during the last century is likely to have been a temporary deviation in a cycle of droughts and very occasional rainfall over the last 3,000 years			2
in 2013 , @entity122 received less rain than in any year since its formation as a state in 1850			2
however droughts lasting more than 100 years are far from unheard of in the state			0
looking back over several thousand years , droughts have been known to last over a decade , and in some cases they can last a century			0
and the patterns tend to repeat , meaning another drought of this length will probably happen again in the future			0
the report follows a separate study earlier this week which found the western @entity115 will face increasingly severe mega-droughts later this century if no action is taken to curb climate change			2
the report said that ' unprecedented drought conditions ' - the worst in more than 1,000 years - are likely to come to the @entity155 and @entity156 after 2050 and persist because of global warming			2
it was the first study to predict that the coming intense dry spells could exceed the decades - long mega-droughts that occurred centuries ago and are blamed for the demise of certain civilisations in the late 13th century			0
' nearly every year is going to be dry toward the end of the 21st century compared to what we think of as normal conditions now , ' said study lead author dr @entity167 , a @entity9 atmospheric scientist			2
' we 're going to have to think about a much drier future in western @entity169			0
' according to the study , published in the journal @entity172 , there is a more than 80 per cent chance that much of central and the western @entity115 will have a mega-drought lasting at least 35 years later this century			2
' water in the @entity155 is going to become more precious than it already is , ' said study co-author dr @entity177 of @entity178			0
' i was honestly surprised at just how dry the future is likely to be			0
' ' i look at these future mega-droughts like a slow moving natural disaster			0
we have to put mega-droughts into the same category as other natural disasters that can be dealt with through risk management			0
' @entity9 scientists used tree rings to understand past droughts and climate models incorporating soil moisture data to estimate future drought risk in the 21st century ( shown ) researchers say the current mega-drought in the @entity115 is going to get worse			0
they say there will be more and more droughts starting in 2050			0
and there 's an 80 % chance one could last at least 35 years			0

@entity206 shows how large areas of @entity20 will be hit by floods in the 2020s
meanwhile areas of @entity25 and the @entity26 will face same fate in 2050s
rainfall in @entity0 is expected to increase 4 to 11 per cent by the 2050s
temperatures will increase 4.1 ° f to 5.7 ° f by the 2050s , according to report
*heatwaves* will increase from two per year to roughly six per year by 2080s
