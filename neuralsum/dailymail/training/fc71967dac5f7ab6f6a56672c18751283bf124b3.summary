but the man had not moved and was then discovered by the public ' close to the car ' hours later , an @entity17 investigation has found			1
crash : the car was found in a ditch here on the @entity10 near @entity12 but despite two searches police failed to find the driver until the public did five hours later experts said the officers should have been more thorough and prevented him getting early treatment for his injured chest and pelvis			1
' while there are no specific policies or training for police officers regarding the physical search of a given area in these circumstances , i think the officers should have spent more time and care carrying out searches at the scene , ' @entity17 commissioner @entity34 said today			2
' the medical evidence indicates the injured man must have been in the ditch , close to the car , at the time the police officers were there , and the officers ' failure to find him meant that valuable time was lost before he received medical attention			1
' the damaged dark blue @entity57 was reported at about 11.20am on july 8 , 2012			0
police attended and established the identity of the car 's owner and visited the registered address but could not find him			0
two officers searched the area around the car and , when they failed to find the man , attached ' authorities aware ' stickers to the car			1

assistant chief constable @entity105 , from @entity106 , said the force fell short of its expected standards on this occasion			0
he said : ' while the report acknowledges some of the unique challenges faced by the officers at the scene of this incident , we can only apologise to the victim and his family for the distress caused by their failure to discover him hidden at an earlier opportunity and , later , for the unintentional indiscretion of the control room operator			0
' management action was taken against the two officers to address the performance issues highlighted			0
' lessons learned from the failings identified by the @entity17 will be applied to further improve the service we deliver			0
