jockey @entity0 is hoping he has received the call up for the ride that will finally help him banish his @entity5 's @entity4 blues at @entity6 on saturday			1
the 26 - year - old rides well - backed @entity8 , stepping in for broken leg victim @entity9 on the @entity11 - trained gelding which won on the opening day of last month 's @entity13			1
the eight - year - old is a 12 - 1 shot for the £ 1million steeplechase but @entity0 knows more than most how fickle fortune can be in the biggest steeplechase in the world			1
jockey @entity0 ( left ) exits the weighing room at @entity22 racecourse back in april earlier this year the @entity23 ridden by @entity9 clears the last jump during @entity25 of @entity13 2015 as a 20 - year - old , @entity0 chose to ride seventh fence faller @entity27 , a disappointment turned into a calamity at the time because he had decided against partnering successful @entity34 - trained stablemate @entity32 who lifted the prize at 100 - 1 with stand - in rider @entity37 basking in glory			1
it was the only time in three national runs for @entity32 that @entity0 had not ridden the gelding			1
@entity0 's two latest rides in the race have seen him unseated from a hampered @entity44			1
@entity0 said : ' the @entity46 incident was quite a blow at the time because i had a choice ( of mounts ) and picked the wrong one			1
i rode him the year before and the year afterwards , i just was n't on him on the right day but that is just the way it goes			1
' sometimes you are ahead and sometimes you are behind – that is life in general			0
' at the time i was 20 , very young in life as well as racing			0
it was probably the first negative thing to happen in my career			0
' up until then i had never been injured , i had ridden out my claim in 14 months and was champion conditional			0
since then there have been lots of good days and lots of bad days , so you become more streetwise and thicker skinned			0
' i did n't had the best of luck on @entity44			0
he jumped well both times but ran into traffic problems and was more of less brought down last year			2
' there is an element of luck required in any race but that applies more with the @entity4 because of the nature of the fences and the distance			2
' @entity0 , who has enjoyed success over the famous fences in other races , feels the @entity8 has the right credential given that slice of @entity6 luck which has so far eluded him			2
the jockey who hopes to be a contender for champion jockey after @entity91 retires , added : ' it is definitely one of the best rides to pick up			2
@entity95 , the chief handicapper , says he is the best handicapped horse in the race			0
' the race should suit this horse			0
he handled the hustle and bustle of the @entity13 and came out a very nice winner			0
that should stand him in good stead as far as the @entity6 experience goes			0
