@entity0 and @entity1 have been convicted of match - fixing in the scandal that rocked cricket			1
they both now face up to seven years in prison when they are sentenced on thursday after being found guilty of conspiracy to cheat and accept corrupt payments			1
after deliberating for nearly 17 hours , the jury convicted the pair at @entity13 's @entity12			1
and it can now be revealed that @entity15 has already pleaded guilty to both charges			1
this detail was not previously reported because of court restrictions			1
good riddance : butt waves before discovering his verdict @entity23 , senior lawyer in the @entity27 's special crime and counter-terrorism division , said : ' @entity0 , @entity15 and @entity1 deliberately and knowingly perverted the course of a cricket match for financial gain			1
' through their actions they brought shame on the cricketing world , jeopardising the faith and admiration of cricket fans the world over			2
' this prosecution shows that match fixing is not just unsportsmanlike but is a serious criminal act			2
' the actions of these top international players went against everything expected of someone in their position and they failed to take into account their fans of all ages and nationalities when deciding to abandon the values of sportsmanship so unconditionally			2
' the prosecution said that @entity0 , @entity15 , and @entity1 conspired together , in august 2010 , to accept money as an inducement or reward for the giving of advance information about the bowling of no - balls in the @entity63 's test match by @entity1 and @entity15			1
' the court was told that these charges related to the bowling of no - balls on august 26 and 27 2010 , during @entity69 's fourth test at @entity70 in @entity13			1
' people who had paid good money to see a professional and exciting game of cricket on the famous ground at @entity70 had no idea that what they were watching was not a true game but one where part of the game had been pre-determined for cash			2
' @entity0 and @entity1 denied any wrongdoing but the jury has decided after hearing all the evidence that what happened on the crease that day was criminal in the true sense of the word			2
' the pair did not react to the first verdicts , sitting expressionless in the dock			1
@entity1 returned to the court in the afternoon to be found guilty of the charge of accepting corrupt payments			1
@entity0 was found guilty as his wife @entity96 gave birth to their second son after undergoing a caesarean section in hospital in @entity69			1
former @entity102 captain @entity0 , 27 , and fast bowler @entity1 , 28 , plotted to bowl deliberate no - balls in last summer 's @entity105 against @entity106			2
the pair were caught after an undercover reporter recorded @entity110 - based sports agent @entity109 , 36 , boasting how he could arrange for @entity69 cricketers to rig games for money			1
@entity109 claimed he had been carrying out match - fixing for two - and - a - half years and had made ' masses and masses of money '			1
he spoke of the advantages of ' grooming ' younger cricketers to work with him and bragged that he had seven players in @entity69 's national side rigging games for him			2
the corrupt agent also discussed deliberately losing the @entity125 test match against @entity106 last summer for more than a million dollars and plotted to fix games at last year 's @entity127 in the @entity128			2
the fixing scandal emerged after the @entity131 's investigations editor @entity130 approached @entity109 in august last year pretending to be a wealthy @entity133 businessman seeking major international cricketers for a tournament			2
the agent was secretly filmed accepting Â£ 150,000 in cash from the journalist as part of an arrangement to rig games			2
@entity109 promised the reporter that @entity1 and fellow fast bowler @entity15 , 19 , would deliver three no - balls at specific points during the @entity105 between @entity69 and @entity106 from august 26 to 29 last year			1
guilty : @entity1 faces the waiting media at @entity12 the no - balls were bowled exactly as promised			1
the probability of someone predicting this by chance was estimated by a cricket statistician as 1.5 million to one			2
@entity0 and @entity1 both strenuously denied any involvement in match - @entity152 why he bowled a no - ball at @entity63 's precisely when @entity109 said he would , @entity1 claimed that @entity0 told him " run faster , f * * * er " moments before his delivery			2
the former @entity69 captain said the agent asked him to rig parts of crunch games at the @entity160 and last summer 's @entity161 against @entity106			0
he insisted he ignored the requests , but admitted he did not fulfil his duty to inform the cricketing authorities about the corrupt approach			0
blatant : @entity15 bowled obvious no balls at @entity70 the jury was not told that @entity15 pleaded guilty to conspiracy to cheat and conspiracy to accept corrupt payments at a pre-trial hearing on september 16			1
@entity15 , a teenage cricketing sensation who was tipped to become one of the all - time great fast bowlers , issued a heartfelt apology for his actions through his lawyer when he pleaded guilty			1
his barrister , @entity177 , told the court : ' @entity15 wants to make it clear he wants to take full responsibility for what he did by deliberately bowling two no - balls			1
' this vulnerable 18 - year - old boy , as he was then , was subjected to extreme pressure from those upon whom he should have been able to rely			0
guilty : @entity1 ( left ) and @entity0 together at @entity186 in 2010 ' he recognises the damage he has caused @entity69 cricket and he wishes to do his best to put that right			1
' the jury was also not told that the @entity191 imposed long suspensions on the three @entity69 cricketers in february			0
@entity0 was banned for 10 years , five of them suspended , @entity1 for seven years , two of them suspended , and @entity15 was banned for five years			1
they are all appealing against the bans			0
the officer in charge of the case , detective chief superintendent @entity198 , of the @entity199 , paid tribute to the @entity131 for the investigation which sparked the charges			0
he said : ' you have to give credit to the investigative journalism			0
i recognised there was a case to build on top of it			0
it 's fair to say we would n't be here without their investigative journalism that started it			0
' @entity220 : @entity131 cover reacting to the outcome of the trial , sports minister @entity222 said : ' this is a sad day for international cricket and sport in general			1
the integrity of sport is absolutely paramount			1
fans have to be sure that what they see in front of them is true and fair			0
' there needs to be a global effort on sports betting integrity and this is something that the @entity240 president @entity239 has taken a lead on , heading up a high - level working group that i sit on			1
' international sports bodies and governments need to work together and do everything possible to stamp out the threat of corruption in sport			1
' @entity251 was @entity69 's team manager last summer , when the corruption was first alleged			0
the 76 - year - old said the players had failed to heed his warnings about outside influences			0
@entity251 told @entity257 : ' it is a very disappointing and sad day for us in one way , for the players and for @entity69 cricket to be caught up in criminal proceedings			0
' but they did something wrong and they had to pay the price for it			0
as manager , i had spoken to all the players on that tour and had talked about focusing on cricket and keeping their eye on the ball , but in the case of some , they did n't			0
' i think the impact of the entire incident has already been felt months ago , when the case first came up , when the players were banned by the @entity191			0
what is required now is to forget everything and move ahead			0
' these things have happened in the past and the game has moved on			0
@entity133 had its own case and banned its players			0
the biggest jolt has already happened for @entity69 cricket and it could not get worse			0
' but we have recovered from this and the team is doing well , i do n't think the verdict will hurt the team now , there is no shortage of talent in @entity69			0
' @entity251 stressed the players who have come into the @entity69 team have ensured the convicted trio are not being missed			0
he said : ' we had good players who could replace the players involved in this case and they have done so			0
we just want the team to keep doing well now			0

revealed : @entity15 has already pleaded guilty to crimes
