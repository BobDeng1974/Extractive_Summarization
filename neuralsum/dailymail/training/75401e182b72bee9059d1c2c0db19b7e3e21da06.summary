by @entity0 everyone regrets not being more kind to a person at some point in their lives			0
and now scientists have shown that a mere seven hours of brain training can make humans kinder and more likely to help those in need			2
@entity12 researchers have discovered that training people to be more compassionate actually changes their brains			2
scientists have shown that a mere seven hours of brain training can make humans kinder ( illustrated ) and more likely to help those in need some scientists believe that kindness evolved from simple cooperation			1
they believe humans have evolved to think it ’s better to take the risk of being generous and getting nothing in return , than destroying a potentially beneficial future relationship by being stingy			0
talking about a 2011 study , professor @entity29 , of the @entity30 , said : ‘ there are two errors a co-operating animal can make , and one is more costly than the other			0
‘ believing that you will never meet this individual again , you might choose to benefit yourself at his expense , only to find out later that the relationship could have been open - ended			0
‘ if you make this error , you lose out on all the benefits you might have had from a long - term			0
this is an extraordinarily costly error			0
‘ the other error is to mistakenly assume that you will have additional interactions , only to find out that it was n’t necessary			0
although you were “ unnecessarily ” nice in that interaction , the cost of this error is relatively small			0
scientists at the @entity51 at the @entity52 , in @entity53 , used compassion mediation – an ancient @entity56 technique to increase caring feelings for people who are suffering – in their experiment			1
lead author @entity60 said : ‘ our fundamental question was , “ can compassion be trained and learned in adults ? ” our evidence points to yes			2
’ she likened the kindness training to weight training			1
’ using this systematic approach , we found that people can actually build up their compassion “ muscle ” and respond to others ' suffering with care and a desire to help			2
’ people who had compassion training were compared to a control group that learned cognitive reappraisal , which is a technique where people learn to reframe their thoughts to feel less negative			1
the researchers then looked at whether people became more altruistic and reported their findings in @entity83 , a journal of the @entity85			2
participants in the experiment played a game on the internet in which they were given the opportunity to spend their own money in order to help out someone in need			1
scientists at the @entity51 at the @entity52 , used compassion mediation ¿ an ancient @entity56 technique to increase caring feelings for people who are suffering ¿ in their experiment ( stock image ) ms @entity60 said : ‘ we found that people trained in compassion were more likely to spend their own money altruistically to help someone who was treated unfairly than those who were trained in cognitive reappraisal			1
’ the study also measured changes in brain responses using functional magnetic resonance imaging ( @entity109 ) before and after training			0
in an mri scanner , participants viewed images depicting human suffering , such as a crying child or a burn victim and generated feelings of compassion towards the people using their practised skills			2
the control group was exposed to the same images and asked to recast them in a more positive light			0
the study found that people trained in compassion were more likely to spend their own money altruistically to help someone who was treated unfairly the researchers measured how much brain activity had changed from the beginning to the end of the training and found that the people who were the most altruistic after compassion training were the ones who showed the most brain changes when viewing human suffering			1
they discovered that activity was increased in the inferior parietal cortex , a region of the brain involved in empathy and understanding others			0
compassion training also increased activity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the extent to which it communicated with the nucleus accumbens , which are brain regions involved in emotion regulation and the production of positive emotions			1
ms @entity60 said people who completed kindness training learn to regulate their emotions so that they ‘ approach people 's suffering with caring ’ and want to help those in need			1
the study also measured changes in brain responses using functional magnetic resonance imaging ( @entity109 ) before and after training			0
a stock mri image is pictured compassion , like physical and academic skills , appears to be something that is not fixed , but rather can be enhanced with training and practice			1
@entity169 , a psychiatry professor at the university , said : ‘ the fact that alterations in brain function were observed after just a total of seven hours of training is remarkable			0
‘ compassion and kindness training in schools can help children learn to be attuned to their own emotions as well as those of others , which may decrease bullying			1
‘ compassion training also may benefit people who have social challenges such as social anxiety or antisocial behaviour			1

scientists from the @entity52 said kindness is not fixed , but can be enhanced with training and practice
people trained in compassion were more likely to spend their own money altruistically in their experiment
kindness training in schools could help children learn to be attuned to their own emotions and decrease bullying
