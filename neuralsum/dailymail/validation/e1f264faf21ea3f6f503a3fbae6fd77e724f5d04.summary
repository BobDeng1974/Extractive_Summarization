for much of the past four years , @entity0 has been damaged , both physically and mentally			1
@entity1 , the @entity2 manager , describes him as a ' frightened ' footballer			1
self - belief was never an issue until a relentless series of muscle injuries began			1
to some , @entity0 is the best player @entity2 have			1
an £ 8million star - in - waiting			2
reduced to the role of a walk - on extra in each of the past four seasons , however , it ’s hard to be certain			2
‘ it ’s been a long time since @entity0 has been consistently good , ’ said @entity1			1
‘ but , touch wood , that ’s six months without a pulled muscle and he is moving in the right direction			1
@entity2 winger @entity0 has been plagued by injuries during the last four years of his career ‘ we have been unbelievably patient with him because we have had to build him up from the bottom			1
’ @entity1 might have been describing ’ 70s tv character @entity22 , the six million dollar man , rather than a winger recently rated in an altogether higher bracket			1
stripped down and carefully rebuilt in a painstaking quest to get to the heart of the injuries that have rendered him a @entity32 bystander at times , there is cautious optimism from @entity1 that — this time — @entity0 might just be ready			1
a second - half substitute and the scorer of the second goal against @entity39 , the winger was close to stealing the show in sunday ’s @entity43 win			1
yet his efforts were not appreciated by everyone			2
@entity47 ’s feelings on the spot - kick @entity0 won and missed were embarrassingly public			1
knocking the desk before him , however , @entity1 welcomed signs that the physical frailties in the @entity53 make - up are healing			1
@entity0 missed a penalty in the @entity43 final after arguing with @entity47 over who should take it ‘ it has been hard work building his self - belief back up , so that he wo n’t get these injuries , ’ said the @entity2 boss			1
‘ it has been slow			2
i was happy for him to score on sunday and win a penalty			2
‘ but , you know , he is not even close to what he can be as a footballer			2
‘ i am happy he is going in the right direction — but we know there are still things to work on			0
‘ he has the right people around him and we know that , if we get it right , he will be a very important player for us			0
’ arriving from @entity75 , @entity1 expected @entity0 to be one of his key players			1
a coach who revels in the relentless quest for physical improvement , the @entity78 international has become his pet project			0
according to @entity1 , the balance of his body was all wrong , his running style placing strain on vulnerable muscles			1
@entity2 manager @entity1 says he has had to be patient with @entity0 while he overcomes his injury hell ‘ @entity0 has been worse than he is now , ’ he said			1
‘ he was afraid because he had been out for two of the past four years with a lot of pulled muscles			2
‘ you get frightened and we need to get his confidence back and believing in himself			2
it has been psychological , but it has also about getting the balance and control of his body			0
‘ he has a great attitude and is working hard			0
so far , we have managed to get him out of the cycle of pulled muscles — but he has had other things , as well			0
‘ when you get a sore knee or twisted ankle , it affects your way of running			0
‘ he ’s in a very good place now after 30 minutes on sunday and 90 minutes last week , plus full training on monday and tuesday			0
’ @entity0 is available for selection against @entity39 in their @entity111 quarter - final replay			1
‘ i can see he will get better and better , ’ said @entity1 , who can call again on @entity112 at right - back			1
‘ it ’s about strengthening his core , getting balance to change direction at high speeds			0
the medical staff have been working hard at getting it right , but now he needs more time on the pitch			0
@entity0 smashes the ground in frustration after failing to score the rebound to his missed penalty ‘ his body is not nearly where it should be			1
it takes him five days to recover from playing 90 minutes			0
‘ we have to be careful because , when you are tired , that ’s when you get pulled muscles			0
‘ we have to build him up step by step			0
hopefully , in six months we will be sitting feeling excited about @entity0			1
’ his inclusion in @entity139 ’s @entity78 squad to face @entity140 and @entity141 surprised some as much as did the exclusion of @entity0 ’s new @entity32 team - mates @entity143 and @entity145			1
‘ i am not surprised about @entity78 because they are thinking the same as us , ’ said @entity1			1
‘ they know what he is able to do and his skills are so high in certain situations , like when we want pace and touch , ability in one - on - ones			2
@entity139 will be thinking about @entity141 and he needs players who can go past defenders			0
‘ @entity145 and @entity143 have just started at @entity2 and i think they need more consistency and performances			2
in the end , hopefully , they will be good enough to get into the squad			0
’ the 23 - year - old did get his name on the score sheet however as @entity2 beat @entity39 2 - 0 after already playing for @entity39 in the @entity111 , neither can face their former club on wednesday evening			1
familiarity is in danger of breeding contempt between the teams and others must wish they could also excuse themselves from a third meeting in 10 days			0
the three games have featured four red cards ( two rescinded ) and three penalty kicks			0
@entity39 ’s keeper @entity179 has saved two of them			2
to that end , @entity181 and @entity182 will again be assigned spot - kick duties for @entity2			1
@entity47 , who had a spectacular public strop after @entity0 held firm on sunday , will again be told to stand aside			2
‘ i have not said so much , ’ remarked @entity1 of that episode			2
‘ we have talked about it , but it ’s nothing			0
‘ we had @entity181 and @entity182 to take penalties and both were off			0
‘ i do n’t have any problems with @entity47 as a character			0
he is a funny boy			0
he is a striker who loves scoring goals and wants to take penalties			0
‘ they are young players and they have to learn and use these experiences to get better			0
‘ we talked about the need to put the team first			0
there ’s no point arguing inside the team			0
