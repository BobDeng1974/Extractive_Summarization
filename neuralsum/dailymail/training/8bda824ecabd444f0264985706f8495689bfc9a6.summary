by @entity0 published : 20:35 est , 8 june 2013 updated : 00:24 est , 9 june 2013 the director of national intelligence responded saturday to the disclosure of classified government surveillance programs , saying these measures kept @entity5 safe and are ' authorized by @entity6 '			1
hoping to ' dispel some of the myths ' after leaked documents published by @entity10 and the @entity11 shed light on two top - secret government surveillance programs , @entity7 said in a statement the purpose of the programs is ' to obtain foreign intelligence information , including information necessary to thwart terrorist and cyber attacks against the @entity5 and its allies '			1
this week , @entity10 published a classified document that detailed how a division of @entity24 was ordered to give cell phone records to the @entity26			1
the @entity10 and the @entity11 also reported that another program , called ' prism ' , was used by @entity5 intelligence agencies to gain access to the files maintained by top @entity33 companies like @entity34 , @entity35 and @entity36			1
in statements , those companies denied providing the government with special access to their files			0
defensive : director of national intelligence @entity7 said in a statement saturday that disclosures on intelligence gathering practices were ' reckless ' both the phone - records program and @entity28 were approved by a judge , but @entity28 allowed government agencies to gain access to various internet conversations , including email			1
in his statement , @entity7 said @entity28 , which was authorized in the @entity54 , has been in place since 2008			2
the @entity56 reported saturday that earlier this week the @entity26 filed a criminal report with the @entity58 in relation to the leaks			1
@entity7 called the disclosures ' reckless '			0
' in a rush to publish , media outlets have not given the full context – including the extent to which these programs are overseen by all three branches of government – to these effective tools , ' he said			0
' in particular , the surveillance activities published in @entity10 and the @entity11 are lawful and conducted under authorities widely known and discussed , and fully debated and authorized by @entity6			1
' @entity7 's statement came as a new @entity10 report revealed more information on the @entity26 's tool for recording and analyzing intelligence			1
documents obtained by the @entity10 reveal the government uses a data mining tool , called @entity81 , to map information the agency collects			1
the @entity10 reported the agency collected ' almost 3 billion pieces of intelligence from @entity5 computer networks over a 30 - day period ending in march 2013 '			2
' the tool allows users to select a country on a map and view the metadata volume and select details about the collections against that country , ' according to an @entity26 fact sheet about the program obtained by @entity10			1
in his statement , @entity7 said the agency is limited in discussing their intelligence gathering practices by the @entity26 's need to protect their methods and sources			1
@entity103 : the director of national intelligence @entity7 , left , released a statement on @entity28 , which is reported to have been used to gather information from the data centers of @entity33 companies like @entity36 , one of which is pictured left ' necessary ' : the top intelligence official , @entity7 , said the @entity26 's intelligence measures disclosed in recent reports were ' used to keep @entity5 safe ' ' disclosing information about the specific methods the government uses to collect communications can obviously give our enemies a " playbook " of how to avoid detection , ' @entity7 said			1
@entity7 added the recent disclosures have caused ' significant misimpressions ' , adding he could not correct all ' inaccuracies ' without revealing even more classified information			2
in order to ' dispel some of the myths ' , the @entity26 also released a three - page fact sheet on intelligence collection as outlined by the @entity129			2
the fact sheet noted the government ' does not unilaterally obtain information from the servers of @entity5 electronic communication service providers ' but only through court approval with provider 's knowledge			0
@entity6 also authorized the use of @entity28 , which the fact sheet called an ' internal government computer system ' and ' not an undisclosed collection or data mining program '			2
the fact sheet also tried to dispel many @entity5 ' concerns , noting the government can not target anyone 's computer or phone records without ' an appropriate , and documented , foreign intelligence purpose for the acquisition ( such as for the prevention of terrorism , hostile cyber activities , or nuclearproliferation ) and the foreign target is reasonably believed to be outside the @entity5			2
national security : top intelligence official @entity7 said secret programs revealed in recent news reports are ' necessary to thwart terrorist and cyber attacks against the @entity5 and its allies ' the fact sheet detailed how their intelligence gathering was approved or overseen by the three branches of government			1
' finally , the notion that @entity169 activities are not subject to internal and external oversight is similarly incorrect			0
collection of intelligence information under @entity169 is subject to an extensive oversight regime , incorporating reviews by the @entity177 , @entity178 and judicial branches , ' the fact sheet said			0
in the fact sheet , @entity7 also highlighted how intelligence gathered using these programs has provided ' insight into terrorist networks and plans '			1
' for example , the intelligence community acquired information on a terrorist organization 's strategic planning efforts , ' he said in the fact sheet			2
' communications collected under @entity169 have yielded intelligence regarding proliferation networks and have directly and significantly contributed to successful operations to impede the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and related technologies			0
' president @entity199 also noted the importance of the intelligence programs in an event in @entity203 friday			0
' i came in with a healthy skepticism about these programs , ' he said according to multiple reports			0
' my team evaluated them			0
we scrubbed them thoroughly – we actually expanded some of the oversight , increased some of the safeguards			0
but my assessment and my team 's assessment was that they help us prevent terrorist attacks			0
you ca n't have 100 per cent security and also then have 100 per cent privacy and zero inconvenience			0
we 're going have to make some choices as a society			0
