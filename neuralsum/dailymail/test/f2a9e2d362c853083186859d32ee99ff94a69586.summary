welcome to the exoplanet hd 189733b , where temperatures reach 3,000 ° @entity2 ) and winds are in excess of 620mph ( 1,000km/h )			1
this world might be 63 light - years away - and we ca n’t even get a direct image of it - but scientists have incredibly been able to measure its atmosphere , just by measuring its sodium emission			1
the findings - made with a relatively small telescope - suggest we may soon have the opportunity to examine other distant worlds beyond the solar system in unprecedented detail			1
@entity20 researchers measured the temperature of ' @entity23 ' hd 189733b			1
they found the temperature reaches up to 3,000 ° c in the atmosphere ( shown in diagram )			1
and wind speeds are in excess of 620 miles per hour			2
the findings were made using a novel technique relying on sodium signals the research was carried out by scientists from the universities of @entity35 and @entity36 in @entity20			1
@entity37 is a gas - giant slightly larger than @entity39 located 370 trillion miles ( 600 trillion km ) from @entity40 - or 63 light - years			2
it is located in the constellation @entity43 in the night sky - also known as the ‘ little fox ’			0
the scientists found that the temperature on the planet increases dramatically with altitude – up to 3,000 ° @entity50 ) in the upper atmosphere , hot enough to melt lead			1
type : ' @entity23 ' gas giant distance from @entity40 : 63 light years temperature : up to 3,000 ° c ( 5,400 ° f ) wind speed : 620mph ( 1,000km/h ) conditions : glass particles in the atmosphere give it its dazzling blue colour			1
coupled with the extremely high wind speed of 620 mph ( 1,000km/h ) , it reveals the planet has an extremely turbulent atmosphere - and is almost certainly inhospitable to life			1
the planet was already known to orbit 13 times closer to its star that @entity69 is to our sun , completing an orbit in just 2.2 days			0
but the results are exciting , because it highlights just how much information we can glean from a distant world with limited technologies			0
speaking to @entity79 , subproject leader dr @entity78 said it could be possible to measure the conditions on an @entity40 - like world using this technique – although the process was difficult			0
‘ it remains to be seen if the astronomical community is able to do these measurements for @entity40 analogues , ’ he said			0
the difficulty arises because an @entity40 - sized world blocks out much less of the light of its parent star compared to a @entity39 - sized world like @entity95 b ‘ it would help if we can find an @entity40 - like exoplanet orbiting a really bright star , ’ dr @entity78 added			0
and he said the research was important because they used a ' dinky four - metre telescope from the ground to do measurements of the quality as the @entity108			1
' @entity37 ( right ) is a gas - giant slightly larger than @entity39 ( left ) located 600 trillion kilometres from @entity40 - or 63 light - years			0
it is located in the constellation @entity43 in the night sky - also known as the ‘ little fox ’ the scientists found that the temperature on the planet ( illustrated ) increases dramatically with altitude – up to 3,000c in the upper atmosphere , hot enough to melt lead			2
the technique works by measuring the ‘ sodium signal ’ from distant worlds			0
when a planet passes in front of its star , the intensity of this signal varies			0
depending on how weak or strong the signal is , it is possible to work out how hot the planet is			0
and because the signals come from different altitudes , the scientists can measure the temperature difference across the atmosphere			2
lower down on the planet , temperatures are believed to drop to a still - scorching 1,700 ° @entity138 )			1
to measure the wind , the team measured how the sodium lines were ‘ blueshifted ’ - meaning its light was stretched in such a way to indicate it was coming towards us			2
the planet ( shown ) was already known to orbit 13 times closer to its star that @entity69 is to our sun , completing an orbit in just 2.2 days			0
but the results are exciting , because it highlights just how much information we can glean from a distant world with limited technologies and this blueshift suggests winds are coming from a circulation process on the planet – or , in other words , superfast winds			0
comparable measurements of this planet have been made before , using large ground - based telescope ( with mirrors up to 10 metres in size ) and the @entity108			1
but this research used a comparatively small telescope , just 3.6 metres wide , at the @entity168 ( @entity168 ) in @entity169 , @entity170			2
the research opens up the opportunity of studying atmospheres of distant exoplanets without having to resort to giant observatories or space telescopes .			0

@entity20 researchers examined the ' @entity179
temperatures reach 3,000 ° c in the atmosphere and wind speed is 620mph
findings were comparable in quality to the @entity108
but the researchers used a ' relatively dinky ' telescope , suggesting the method could be *replicated* by other astronomers to study exoplaents
