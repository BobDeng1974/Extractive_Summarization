the plan to name supermarkets who sell raw chicken with the campylobacter bug was been scrapped a plan to regularly name and shame supermarkets selling chicken contaminated with the dangerous food poisoning bug campylobacter is set to be killed off following pressure from retailers			1
the @entity10 ( @entity10 ) had promised to carry out regular surveys of chicken sold on the high street and publish the results , including the names of the stores , every three months			1
the idea was that the public naming and shaming exercise would put pressure on the stores to clean up their chicken and reduce the food poisoning risk to customers			1
however , the officials at the watchdog now want to scrap this idea and instead only publish data on the number of birds that are contaminated without identifying the stores involved			1
the move has been condemned by a leading academic , who suggested it was driven by pressure from the industry and @entity38 departments , who are keen support supermarkets , farmers and processors			0
the changes represent a major victory for the commercial interests of the big retailers , putting concerns for their sales and profits ahead of consumer safety and their right to know what they are eating			0
the fact that the supermarkets have managed to water down the scheme is just the latest evidence as to how lobbying by big business has driven a change in official policy on food and health issues			0
similar lobbying killed off a plan for a blanket ban on junk food snacks and drinks from displays around supermarket check - outs			0
the @entity10 recently revealed that more than one million people are falling victim to food poisoning every year with supermarket chicken named as the greatest threat			1
@entity75 , which is most often found on raw chicken , is the biggest cause of food poisoning in the country			1
an official study published in 2009 revealed that two in three of all fresh chicken on shelves was contaminated with campylobacter			2
more than one in four – 27 per cent – were classed as being highly contaminated			0
despite the fact the @entity10 has asked supermarkets and farmers to make combatting campylobacter a top priority , the situation appears to have shown no improvement since then			2
an @entity10 paper on the food poisoning caused by campylobacter warned : ‘ in addition to the attendant economic costs , cases cause inconvenience , discomfort and misery to those who become infected and a small proportion of cases result in death or long - term consequences , such as reactive arthritis , irritable bowel syndrome and @entity109 , the latter of which affects the peripheral nervous system			1
’ despite the clear threat , the @entity10 ’s executives are now asking its board to redraw the rules for its surveys to ensure the stores selling contaminated chicken are not identified in its quarterly results			1
a paper prepared by officials states this is in response to ‘ legitimate concerns expressed by the industry and other government departments ’			0
the references to other departments relates to the food and farming department , @entity126 , which sees itself as a champion of @entity130 farmers , including those producing chicken			1
the bug , pictured , which is thought to be in two in three of all fresh chickens on supermarket shelves the @entity10 paper states : ‘ in the last update to the @entity138 in march 2014 it was stated that the @entity10 intended to release the full results , including the names of the retailers and processors , of testing of around 1,000 samples every 3 months during the survey , with the first results published around june / july 2014			1
’ however , it says it has now decided to change this approach because there is a risk the results will be incomplete and misleading and it would – in some way – be unfair to the stores			0
the @entity10 said : ‘ one of the drawbacks of this approach is that no interpretation can properly be placed on interim raw data until the full year ’s sampling is complete and fully analysed			2
‘ there has been legitimate concern expressed by industry and other @entity161 that publication of incomplete data , consisting of the results of a single quarter ’s sampling and analysis with retailers and producers identified for each sample , would facilitate misinterpretation of the interim data with the obvious risk of compilation by third parties of ‘ league tables ’ that would not be statistically valid nor supportive of any conclusions drawn from such tables			0
‘ whilst the @entity10 could and would , obviously , caveat any interim data , we can not control any possible misuse of the data which may cause unnecessary concern in , or mislead , consumers			2
’ the watchdog ’s board is being asked to approve this new approach at a meeting tomorrow			0
the @entity10 recently revealed that more than one million people are falling victim to food poisoning every year with supermarket chicken named as the greatest threat @entity194 , the professor of @entity195 at the @entity196 , condemned the move to let the supermarkets off the hook			1
he said : ‘ i am shocked that the staff of the @entity10 are trying to persuade the board to retreat from its previous undertaking to name and shake the stores on what seem to me to be utterly spurious reasons			0
‘ the @entity10 is under intense pressure from industry and ministers not to rock any boats , but to remain invisible and silent			0
if the @entity10 deliberately conceals information that consumers want and deserve their credibility with the general public will be seriously compromised			0
’ he suggested public health could be put at risk if they are denied information on which stores are guilty of selling the most contaminated chicken			1
the @entity221 , which speaks for supermarkets , said publishing the results on chicken , and naming the stores with higher levels of campylobacter , would be ‘ meaningless without any form of analysis			2
’ it said families should take responsibility for protecting themselves against food poisoning			2
a spokesman said : ‘ all the major retailers continue to work with their suppliers to reduce the prevalence of campylobacter – which can also be destroyed through proper cooking			0

@entity239 would have seen stores selling chicken with campylobacter bug named
idea has now been scraped by the @entity10 following pressure from retailers
data on number of contaminated birds will be released without naming retailers
supermarket chicken named the biggest cause of food poisoning in the @entity130
