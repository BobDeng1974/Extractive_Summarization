by @entity0 published : 11:14 est , 21 may 2013 updated : 03:06 est , 22 may 2013 archivists in @entity3 have unearthed vials of moon dust collected from the @entity7 mission , hidden within a warehouse at the @entity9			1
each of the 20 vials have handwritten labels on , dated 24 july 1970 , and were found inside a vacuum - sealed glass jar on the lab 's campus			1
along with the jar was a copy of the paper ' study of carbon compounds in @entity7 and @entity22 returned lunar samples ' , published in the @entity24 in 1971			2
a total of 20 vials containing moon dust and rocks collected during the @entity7 space mission in 1969 have been found abandoned in a warehouse in @entity3			1
the discovery was made by archivists at the @entity33			0
it is unknown how long the samples have been there , although handwritten labels date them at 24 july 1970			1
the vials were found in a vacuum sealed glass jar the handwritten label on this vial of dust , found in a warehouse at the @entity9 in @entity46 , reads : ' @entity47 , 11 @entity48 24 july 1970 '			1
the sample was collected by @entity50 and @entity51 during the @entity7 space mission			0
samples were sent for tests to more than 150 labs worldwide and should have been returned to @entity56 @entity58 soil is the fine layer of the loose rock found on the @entity58 's surface			2
its properties can differ significantly from those of terrestrial soil			0
@entity58 soil is primarily created by the breakdown of basaltic and anorthositic rock			0
these rocks and particles are left on the moon and caused by meteorites and other interstellar particles crashing into the moon 's surface over billions of year			2
@entity76 soil , on the other hand , is formed by molecular oxygen ( @entity78 ) , humidity , atmospheric wind and other biologicial processes			0
the name lunar soil is slightly misleading , too , because soil on @entity76 is defined as containing organic materials , whereas lunar soil was found to contain none			2
there is no official definition of what size fraction of lunar soil is classed as ' moon dust ' - some scientists claim that dust is anything less than 50 micrometres in diameter , whereas others put it at less than 10			1
archivist @entity97 made the discovery			0
@entity100 has worked at the @entity9 's warehouse in @entity46 for 17 years and admitted : ' we do n’t know how or when they ended up in storage			1
” following the successful moon landing of @entity7 in 1969 , astronauts @entity50 and @entity51 collected and brought back various moon rocks and lunar soil samples			1
these samples were catalogued and then sent for tests at around 150 laboratories worldwide			0
one of those was the @entity113 in @entity114 on the @entity116 campus			0
after experiments were carried out and the relevant papers published , the samples should have been sent back to @entity56			2
instead , the moon dust samples from @entity116 were put into storage and forgotten about			1
one of the authors of the 1971 @entity113 paper was @entity123 , a former associate director of @entity9 , then known as @entity124			1
@entity123 also won the 1961 @entity125			0
@entity56 's @entity7 space mission was the first time humans had landed on the moon			2
@entity130 astronauts @entity50 and @entity51 stepped onto the moon 's surface on july 21 , 1969			1
during the mission they collected 47.5 pounds ( 21.5 kg ) of lunar material and brought it back to to @entity76			0
the samples were sent to labs across the world for testing @entity97 of @entity141 at the @entity9 holds samples of moon dust from @entity7 mission found in a warehouse in @entity46 @entity123 's paper examined the nature and chemical characteristics of the carbon in the lunar samples			1
according to a biography of @entity123 by @entity152 and @entity153 , @entity123 helped shape @entity56 ’s efforts to search for extraterrestrial life , including searching for organic and biologic compounds in the lunar samples			0
following the discovery , @entity100 contacted the @entity113			0
she then contacted @entity56 , who asked for the samples to be sent back			0
yet @entity56 told @entity100 she was allowed to open the jar to remove the vials first			1
other artifacts found in the warehouse included glass pieces from @entity9 ’s own glass shop , as well as 140 other pieces of scientific equipment			1
some of the more important items will go on display at @entity9 , and @entity100 hopes the @entity171 will be interested in some of the others			2
she said : ' we ’re hoping another institution will be able to display them			0
' the problem is we do n’t have room for display or storage			0

20 vials of moon dust dating back to 24 july 1970 have been found during a clear out of the @entity9
the vials were vacuum sealed within a glass jar *43* years *ago* to *protect* the *precious* content
the *researchers* say they have ' no idea ' how the vials ended up in a storage
