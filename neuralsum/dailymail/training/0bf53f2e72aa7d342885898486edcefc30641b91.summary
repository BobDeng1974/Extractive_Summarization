a @entity1 hostage held by @entity2 revealed that his fellow captive has been beheaded in a gruesome video released by the terror group on saturday			2
in the film , @entity7 was shown holding a picture of @entity11 ’s decapitated body			1
mr @entity12 , 47 , a freelance journalist , then delivered a message in @entity14 in which he blames @entity1 prime minister , @entity16 , for mr @entity11 ’s death and pleads to his wife , @entity18 : ‘ do n’t let @entity16 do the same for my case			1
’ this still image apparently showing @entity1 prisoner @entity12 holding a picture of fellow captive @entity11 's body appeared alongside the recording , but some have said it looks photoshopped the video emerged a day after a deadline passed for @entity1 ’s government to buy the two hostages ’ release			1
on tuesday , @entity2 ( @entity30 ) posted a video in which the masked @entity33 executioner known as @entity34 demanded £ 134 million within 72 hours to free the two men			1
in the video , the group said it no longer wanted the ransom , but demanded the release of an @entity40 prisoner @entity39 , on @entity41 in the @entity43 capital , @entity44			0
@entity45 , 44 , took part in co-ordinated suicide attacks on three hotels in @entity44 in 2005 which killed 60			0
her suicide vest failed to detonate and she was later found guilty of terrorism and sentenced to death			0
mr @entity12 said in the video the new demand was easier to meet as the @entity1 delegation sent to @entity44 to secure his release could put pressure the @entity43 government to release @entity45			1
mr @entity12 ( left ) appeared in recent footage alongside mr @entity11 ( right ) and @entity61 murderer @entity34			1
however experts also believe this footage was doctored , possibly stitched together from several recordings in his emotional message , mr @entity12 said : ‘ @entity18 , my beloved wife , i love you , and i miss my two daughters			0
please do n’t let @entity16 do the same for my case			0
you , along with our family , friends and my colleagues in the independent press must continue to pressure our government			0
’ in a section almost certainly scripted by @entity30 , he added : ‘ @entity16 , you killed @entity11 , you did not take the threat of my captors seriously and you did not act within 72 hours			1
’ mr @entity12 finished his message by saying : ‘ @entity18 , these could be my last hours in this world and i may be a dead man speaking , do n’t let these be my last words you ever hear			2
do n’t let @entity16 also kill me			0
’ the video has still to be verified but @entity84 , terrorism expert at @entity86 ’s @entity85 for the @entity87 , said : ‘ it probably is genuine			0
