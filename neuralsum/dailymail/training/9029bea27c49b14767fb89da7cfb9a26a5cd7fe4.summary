they say marriage is for better or for worse			2
but for @entity3 , 31 , and @entity4 , 30 , from @entity5 , @entity6 , it appears the latter has become true			2
the couple did everything right before they got married			2
same - sex marriage : same - sex marriage is allowed in 19 states and the @entity14 they fell in love slowly , based on years of friendship stretching back to high school and planned their nuptials carefully for about a year			1
the same sex couple traveled from @entity6 to @entity21 in 2010 as same - sex marriage spread			1
sadly , bad times set in three years later , but uncoupling has proven far more difficult			0
the two women are now trapped in a state of bitter , desperate wedlock , an emerging problem for those who entered into same - sex marriages			2
it seems like a hollow victory for those who wanted marriage equality for everyone , but now ca n't find a way around legal snarls that prevent them getting a divorce			2
@entity6 does n't recognize the marriage of @entity3 and @entity41 , and a judge there ruled recently he had no jurisdiction to either void the union or formally grant a divorce			1
it 's hard to feel like you do n't exist , like you 're invisible under the law , ' @entity41 said			0
@entity3 said : ' it 's a limbo			0
it 's waiting and seeing			0
that 's all i can do			0
' the wait may be a long one as they pursue appeals			0
thankfully , the two are n't fighting over kids , an area particularly difficult in matters of same - sex divorce for couples who traveled to a state granting the freedom to marry from a state that does n't			1
after the honeymoon : many same - sex couples are trapped in marriages that they cant get out of due to laws same - sex marriage is allowed in 19 states and the @entity14 , but laws governing divorce have not kept pace , creating a contradictory patchwork that could take years to resolve			1
' it 's a mess , the inability to get divorced , ' said @entity77 , a senior attorney for the civil rights group @entity79 's @entity80 regional office in @entity81			0
it 's difficult to calculate precisely how many same - sex couples have divorced , but watchdogs like @entity77 are keeping a close eye on the way judges and state legislatures are responding to wedlock and other divorce - related problems			1
' i get hundreds of calls , ' @entity92 divorce attorney @entity91 said			2
' they do n't realize that they 're entering into a marriage that 's kind of like jail			0
' you ca n't get out of it unless you move here to @entity92 and you meet the residency requirements			1
there needs to be some sort of national reform			0
' divorce proceedings are generally inconsistent from state to state , but the process has become more streamlined for same - sex couples who travel to a marriage recognition state to tie the knot			1
if they 're seeking an uncontested divorce , @entity115 , @entity116 , @entity117 , @entity118 , @entity119 and @entity120 — along with the @entity14 — have loosened residency requirements			1
however , they wo n't address child custody , visitation , support or other issues related to uncoupling			0
in @entity129 and 12 other marriage - granting states , however , residency must be established to divorce , taking anywhere from six months to a year or more			1
perhaps the most heartbreaking aspect of wedlock is settling child custody battles , said @entity77 and others			0
fights over kids are usually decided in heterosexual divorces in the state where kids live , said @entity142 , family law director for the @entity143 in @entity144			0
for same - sex couples in states where marriage or civil unions are n't recognized , child - related divorce disputes are murky			1
attorney @entity150 in @entity151 , a family law specialist and lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender advocate , said there can be portability problems in same - sex child custody battles			2
this occurs particularly from state to state , especially when moving from one state that recognizes same - sex marriage to one that does n't			1
' it 's all very challenging for people , ' @entity142 said .			0

same - sex marriage is allowed in 19 states and the @entity14
but laws governing divorce for same - sex couples have not kept pace
some states , like @entity6 , do not recognize gay marriage
it means that a divorce can not be granted in @entity6 to a same - sex couple
it has left many couples unable to get a divorce if their marriage fails
one way around it is to move to @entity92 but you must meet residency requirements to be able to get a divorce
uncontested divorces are easier in @entity115 , @entity116 , @entity117 , @entity118 , @entity119 and @entity120 and the @entity14
