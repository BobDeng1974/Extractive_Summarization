@entity0 today defended a photo she shared of her six - year - old son @entity2 standing on his service dog as she accused @entity4 of a ' hypocritical double standard ' for criticizing her for the image			1
the former @entity8 governor spoke about the controversy on the today show on tuesday after the photo was met with outrage on social media and by @entity4 , who described her as a ' callous woman '			1
she said that she thought it was appropriate to share the photo , which showed her son @entity2 , who has down syndrome , standing on his dog , @entity23 , so that he could reach the sink			1
' @entity2 's service dog is a strong , trained dog that does really , really love his best buddy @entity2 , and they put up with each other and there was no harm at all to this dog , ' she said on tuesday			1
' may 2015 see every stumbling block turned into a stepping stone on the path forward , ' she wrote			0
' @entity2 just reminded me			2
he , determined to help wash dishes with an oblivious mama not acknowledging his signs for ' up ! ' , found me and a lazy dog blocking his way			0
he made his stepping stone			0
' @entity4 released a statement saying ; ' it 's odd that anyone — let alone a mother — would find it appropriate to post such a thing , with no apparent sympathy for the dog in the photo			1
' on the today show , she slammed the organization			2
' i thought , absolutely hypocritical double standard , as usual , applied to , i do n't know , perhaps a constitutional conservative , ' she told @entity67			0
in another @entity36 message , @entity0 had asked why @entity4 has never objected to the actions of other celebrities - including @entity71 , who previously shared a similar picture , and president @entity73 , who admitted to eating dog when he was a child			1
outrage : @entity4 was upset over this photo of six - year - old @entity2 ( above ) standing on the family dog , @entity77 inspiring : the intial post was meant to inspire people at the start of 2015 by showing @entity2 's resilience ' at least @entity2 did n't eat the dog , ' she wrote			1
on the today show on tuesday , she defended the line when @entity67 asked if it was a cheap shot			2
' oh heck no , that was the best line in the post that i wrote , ' she said			0
' it was the kickoff line			0
' the comment was in reference to @entity73 's admission years ago that as a child in @entity95 he did once eat dog meat , and he later mocked @entity0 at the 2012 @entity97 saying : ' what 's the difference between a hockey mom and a pit bull ? a pit bull is delicious			1
' she added on the today show that left wing radicals ' look at him as their messiah but he as a child , probably the same age as @entity2 , did much worse than use the dog as a stepping stool '			1
in her post , @entity0 also asked why @entity4 never attacked @entity71 - @entity4 's @entity114 in 2009 - for a photo on her @entity117 page showing of a child standing on her dog to brush her teeth			1
that child , a little girl , does appear to be much younger and smaller @entity122			0
she admitted she and the organization agree on one thing - ' respecting @entity126 's creation and critters ' - but added that they probably were n't too happy that she enjoyed hunting her food			2
old news : @entity0 says that at least her son ' did n't eat the dog , ' and then goes on to say that president @entity73 ( above ) ' enjoys eating dog meat '			1
he once admitted he had eaten dog as a child in @entity95 loved : @entity0 insisted that the family loves all of their pets and called @entity77 's ' best buddy ' still , she gushed about the animals the family keep in the house			1
' our pets , including @entity2 's best buddy @entity23 , are loved , spoiled and cared for more than some people care for their fellow man whose politics may not mesh with nonsensical liberally failed ways or do n't fit your flighty standards , ' she wrote			2
on the today show , she also explained the dog 's odd name , @entity23			2
' i had a roommate in college named @entity77 , loved her , always wanted a @entity77 , and then @entity23 , that 's a @entity159 name for @entity160 , ' she said			0
' i love in the @entity161			0
i did n't have a sixth kid , but had a dog , and finally i got to use those names			0
' dear @entity4 , chill			0
at least @entity2 did n't eat the dog			1
hey , by the way , remember your ' @entity114 ' , @entity71 ? did you get all wee - wee 'd up when she posted this sweet picture ? hypocritical , much ? did you go as crazy when your heroic @entity171 , @entity73 , revealed he actually enjoyed eating dead dog meat ? are n't you the double - standard radicals always opposing @entity8 's @entity175 – the @entity175 honoring dogs who are born to run in wide open spaces , while some of your pets ' thrive ' in a concrete jungle where they 're allowed outdoors to breathe and pee maybe once a day ? are n't you the same herd that opposes our commercial fishing jobs , claiming i encourage slaying and consuming wild , organic healthy protein sources called ' fish ' ? ( i do			1
) are n't you the same anti-beef screamers blogging hate from your comfy leather office chairs , wrapped in your fashionable leather belts above your kickin ' new leather pumps you bought because your celebrity idols ( who sport fur and crocodile purses ) grinned in a tabloid wearing the exact same louboutins exiting sleek cowhide covered limo seats on their way to some liberal fundraiser shindig at some sushi bar that features poor dead smelly roe ( that i used to strip from our @entity210 - caught fish , and in a @entity213 cannery i packed those castoff fish eggs for you while laughing with co-workers about the suckers paying absurdly high prices to party with the throw away parts of our wild seafood ) ? i believe you call those discarded funky eggs ' caviar '			0
yeah , you 're real credible on this , @entity4			0
a shame , because i 'll bet we agree on what i hope is the true meaning of your mission – respecting @entity126 's creation and critters			0
our pets , including @entity2 's best buddy @entity23 , are loved , spoiled and cared for more than some people care for their fellow man whose politics may not mesh with nonsensical liberally failed ways or do n't fit your flighty standards			2
@entity77 is a precious part of our world			0
