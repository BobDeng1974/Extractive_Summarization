by @entity0 last updated at 2:53 pm on 8th november 2011 ' very worried ' : @entity2 foreign minister @entity1 today expressed concern over speculation of an @entity6 strike on @entity8 nuclear sites @entity2 is ' very worried ' about @entity8 's nuclear programme , but is opposing any strike against the @entity11 because it would cause ' irreparable damage '			1
foreign minister @entity1 today voiced concern about speculation that @entity6 is preparing a strike on @entity8 nuclear sites ahead of the release of an @entity18 report on @entity20 's nuclear activity			1
if the @entity18 report , due out this week , indicates @entity8 is building atomic weapons capabilities , then @entity2 would firmly back further @entity24 sanctions , he said , but would do all it can to stop military action			1
four previous rounds of sanctions have been imposed on @entity8 over its nuclear programme			2
but @entity32 and @entity33 , two veto - wielding @entity31 , members have made clear any new sanctions would be an extremely tough sell			1
' we are very worried about @entity8 stepping out of line			0
it would seriously destabilise the region , ' @entity1 told @entity40			0
' @entity2 's position is firm : if we need to reinforce sanctions , we are ready , ' he said			0
' i think we have to do everything we can to avoid the irreparable damage that military action would cause			0
' @entity8 is pursuing its nuclear weapons program at the @entity51 military base about 30 kilometers from @entity20 , diplomatic sources in @entity48 say @entity51 has hundreds of structures and a number of fortified tunnels and bunkers for carrying out explosive experiments the @entity18 report is widely expected to strengthen suspicions that @entity20 is seeking to develop the capability to make atomic bombs , countering its claims that its nuclear enrichment programme is purely for civilian purposes			2
@entity32 and @entity8 warned the @entity64 against military intervention on monday , saying an attack would lead to civilian casualties and create new threats to global security			1
defence minister @entity70 today appeared to play down speculation about an @entity6 strike , insisting ' we do n't want a war ' @entity33 is also expressing concern about a possible @entity77 military strike against @entity8			1
western nations are likely to react by calling for further sanctions against the @entity81 state , but speculation has been rising that @entity6 is preparing a pre-emptive strike on @entity8 nuclear sites			1
however today , defence minister @entity70 appeared to play down speculation of a strike , saying it had not decided to embark on any military operation			0
' @entity88 is not a picnic			0
we do n’t want a war , ' @entity70 told @entity93			0
' ( @entity6 ) had not yet decided to embark on any operation , ' he said , dismissing @entity6 media speculation that he and prime minister @entity96 had chosen that option			0
fresh details ahead of tomorrow 's @entity18 report suggest that @entity8 could even be ' nuclear ready ' within months			1
and laying bare the disturbing extent of the country ’s atomic weapons programme will increase calls in the @entity77 for pre-emptive action against the @entity81 state			0
the @entity8 nuclear power plant in @entity108 , southern @entity8 - a site that may be targeted in a mooted military strike however , @entity8 has threatened to retaliate by blocking the @entity110 , severing 40 per cent of the world ’s oil supplies			1
@entity32 's foreign minister yesterday became the latest critic of any proposed action against @entity8 warning it would be ' a very serious mistake fraught with unpredictable consequences '			1
@entity118 added : ' the only path for removing concerns is to create every possible condition ' to resume the talks between @entity8 and six world powers , which broke down last december			0
@entity33 has also expressed concern about a military strike against @entity8 , but has also urged @entity20 not to be confrontational with the @entity18			1
@entity126 and @entity127 have signaled concern that the report will box @entity8 into a corner and dim any chance of diplomacy resolving the dispute , which has the potential to spark a wider conflict in the @entity136			0
concerns : @entity32 's foreign minister @entity118 , right , warned any action against @entity8 would be ' a very serious mistake			1
' @entity33 's foreign minister @entity141 , left , has also expressed concern ' the @entity32 in particular have been lobbying quite intensively , ' one senior @entity144 diplomat said			1
meanwhile former @entity77 secretary of state @entity145 has weighed in to slam @entity8 saying the @entity77 should consider even tougher penalties against the @entity8 government and ' be doing everything we can to bring it down			1
' @entity150 told @entity152 's @entity151 that the @entity77 should never take the option of military force off the table when it comes to dealing with @entity8			1
the current @entity8 government is trying to obtain a nuclear weapon and has repressed its own people , she said			2
' the regime has absolutely no legitimacy left , ' she added			0
@entity6 president @entity163 had earlier expressed a determination to launch a military strike against @entity8			2
new @entity24 evidence suggesting @entity8 was helped by several foreign scientists could provide further headache for @entity8 's president @entity169 ' the possibility of a military attack against @entity8 is now closer to being applied than the application of a diplomatic option , ' he said over the weekend			1
' i estimate that intelligence services of all these countries are looking at the ticking clock , warning leaders that there was not much time left , ' he added			0
@entity182 candidate @entity181 , last week came out to back an @entity6 air strike on @entity8			2
the @entity185 governor said he would support @entity6 on the matter if there is proof @entity20 is moving closer to having a nuclear weapon			0
the news comes as a former @entity192 weapons expert and scientists in @entity194 and @entity195 are all believed to have aided @entity8 in its nuclear quest , according to the @entity24			1
former @entity192 weapons scientist @entity197 allegedly taught @entity8 how to build high - precision detonators that could trigger a chain reaction , according to @entity24 evidence			1
@entity197 was believed to have been contracted by @entity8 's @entity201 , linked to the country 's nuclear programme , in the mid 1990s			2
he allegedly gave lectures and shared research on developing and testing bombs that @entity8 then incorporated into their warhead design , according to @entity209 sources with access to @entity18 's files			0
however , while @entity197 acknowledged his role he also said he believe his work was limited to assisting civilian engineering projects , the sources added			0
there is also no evidence that @entity32 knew of @entity197 's @entity8 activities			1
weapons experts added that @entity8 relied on foreign scientists for mathematical formulas and codes , some of which may have come from @entity195			1
the design for a neutron initiator by father of @entity194 's nuclear programme , @entity229 , was also discovered in @entity8 , sources said			2
the latest intelligence provided to @entity24 nuclear officials , due for publication on wednesday and obtained by the @entity209 , suggests former @entity192 weapons scientist @entity197 allegedly taught @entity8 how to build high - precision detonators that could trigger a chain reaction during the mid 1990s			1
' but it makes clear the @entity8 want to be able to build such weapons quickly if need be			0
and thanks to outside help , the @entity8 are now on ' the threshold ' of making a nuclear warhead small enough to fit on top of a ballistic missile , says the study			2
one key technical breakthrough , say the @entity18 ’s intelligence sources , is that @entity8 has learnt how to design a device known as an @entity249 generator			2
it added there was also evidence to suggest other precision technology linked to experts in @entity194 and @entity195 had helped advance @entity8 's nuclear capabilities			1
@entity8 ’s foreign minister and former nuclear official , @entity258 , told the @entity259 : ' let them publish and see what happens , ' adding that the uproar over the country 's nuclear programme was ' 100 per cent political ' and that the @entity18 is ' under pressure from foreign powers			1
' @entity8 president @entity169 said on sunday the @entity77 feared @entity8 's growing military power because it is now able to compete with @entity6 and the @entity64			1
' yes , we have military capabilities that are different from any other country in the region , ' he said			0
' @entity8 is increasing in capability and advancement and therefore we are able to compete with @entity6 and the @entity64 and especially the @entity77			2
' ' the @entity77 fears @entity8 's capability			1
@entity8 will not permit ( anyone from making ) a move against it			0
' proof : a test - fire launch of a short - range missile in @entity8			2
the @entity24 now has a ' compelling case ' that @entity8 is building an arsenal of nuclear weapons @entity8 is conducting its secret nuclear programme at the @entity51 military base , near @entity20 , according to sources close to the @entity18 ( @entity18 )			1
@entity8 has allegedly carried out experiments in the final , critical stage for developing nuclear weapons , including explosions real and simulated			2
these have been carried out in a bus - sized container spotted on satellite photos , according to reports			0
@entity77 intelligence agencies are thought to have believed the base is suitable for developing nuclear weapons for around eight years			2
the @entity8 have rejected an @entity18 request to visit @entity51 in the past , arguing the @entity18 rules allowed it to deny such visits to military bases			0
now the site is under scrutiny again as a suspected location for covert nuclear activity			0
one part of the @entity18 's report is thought to reinforce concerns that @entity8 continued its nuclear programme after 2003 - the year that @entity77 intelligence agencies believed it had bowed to international pressures to halt experiments			1
one @entity8 document suggests scientists had been discussing plans to start a four - year study of neutron initiators beginning in 2007 - four years after the 2003 deadline , according to sources			2
' the programme never really stopped , ' @entity317 , a former @entity24 weapons inspector who has seen the intelligence files said according to the @entity209			0
' after 2003 , money was made available for research in areas that sure look like nuclear weapons work but were hidden within civilian institutions , ' he added			0
@entity20 denies secretly trying to develop nuclear weapons , insisting it is enriching uranium for reactors to generate electricity			0
but @entity8 has become increasingly belligerent in recent weeks and tensions are continuing to mount over its ambitions			0
the country 's history of concealing sensitive nuclear activity and its refusal to suspend work that can potentially yield atomic bombs have already been punished by four rounds of @entity24 sanctions , and separate @entity77 and @entity342 punitive steps			1
earlier this week , it was revealed @entity344 was drawing up contingency plans for any military action			0
commanders were working out how to deploy @entity349 submarines equipped with @entity351 cruise missiles in case president @entity352 decides to launch missile strikes against @entity8 bases .			0

@entity32 and @entity33 warn @entity77 against @entity8 strike
fears mount that @entity8 could be ' nuclear ready ' in a matter of months
@entity24 intelligence suggests @entity8 was helped by foreign experts - including rogue @entity32 scientist
@entity145 : ' we must do everything we can to bring @entity8 down '
@entity169 remains *defiant*
