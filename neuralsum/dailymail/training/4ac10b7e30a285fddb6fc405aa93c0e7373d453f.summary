by @entity0 last updated at 2:46 pm on 6th october 2011 the son of @entity4 guitarist @entity3 did not realise he was swinging from the @entity5 because he had grown up in the countryside without access to television , a court has been told			1
@entity9 , @entity10 's lawyer , made the revelation about his upbringing to the @entity13 while arguing his client 's 16 - month prison sentence should be reduced so he can finish his degree at @entity17			1
mr @entity9 told the hearing that history student @entity3 was aware of the significance of the @entity21 monument but ' did n't realise that the monument from which he was swinging was a war memorial let alone the @entity5			1
' paying the price : @entity10 , pictured with his mother , author @entity27 , and father @entity4 guitarist @entity3 during his trial @entity3 , 21 , was ' out of his mind ' on lsd , whisky and valium when he indulged in ' outrageous and deeply offensive behaviour ' at last december 's student riots			1
he was jailed for 16 months in july after admitting a charge of violent disorder - but his lawyer has argued that the sentence was ' unduly harsh '			1
@entity3 was seen swinging on the @entity40 at the @entity5 just hours before he hurled a bin at a car escorting the @entity43 and @entity44			1
the student also jumped on the bonnet of the car , which was carrying close protection officers , blocking the driver 's view of the @entity53 's @entity52 in front , it was claimed			1
@entity3 was also accused of twice kicking a window of @entity56 in @entity57 as staff and customers cowered inside and he was pictured setting fire to a pile of newspapers by the door of the @entity64 during central @entity66 disorder on december 9 last year			2
mr @entity9 argued at a hearing at the @entity68 that it could n't be proved the history student was the man who threw the bin , and he ' did n't remember ' doing it			1
rampage : @entity3 's lawyer said he had been ' playing the fool ' and ' acting up ' for cameras he also added it was still ' not too late ' for @entity3 to begin his third year at @entity17 if he has his sentenced reduced and is released by october 17			1
mr @entity9 said : ' the concern that i have on behalf of mr @entity3 is that he is keen to know the outcome , whether there 's any prosect , by the 17 october this month , for him to resume his studies			2
' his case was he could remember being knocked over by the @entity86 's door , he could remember being at the side of the @entity88 , he could remember sitting on the @entity86 's bonnet			2
' he had no recollection of throwing the bin			2
he is confident if he threw the bin , he would have remembered '			2
he also argued his client had simply being ' playing the fool ' and ' acting up ' for cameras during the day			2
disputing the length of @entity3 's jail sentence , mr @entity9 claimed it was not possible to say for sure the @entity100 image of the man throwing the bin was @entity3 despite the figure wearing similiar clothes			0
he also argued judge @entity105 had n't given him sufficient credit for his guilty plea or consider his personal mitigation enough			0
mr @entity9 said : ' i do accept on mr @entity3 's part that anyone who takes part in violent disorder committed by a body of people adds to the overall criminality of the behaviour and therefore will receive a longer sentence than if he had committed the offence in isolation			0
' a shorter , sharp shock would be perfectly sufficient to punish him , and at the same time to send a message loud and clear to others who might be minded to act as he did			0
' this sentence was unduly harsh , unnecessarily so , his potential , like that of other young people in his position is being wasted while he spends too long in prison			0
' the dark side of the son : @entity10 was seen rampaging through the streets of @entity66 and was photographed clambering up the @entity5 during the sentencing hearing at @entity135 , it was said that just before his violent outbursts on december 9 last year , @entity3 had ' binged ' on whisky and valium			1
in his mitigation , mr @entity9 explained how @entity3 had become increasingly ' dependant ' on drink and drugs since he was rejected by his biological father , the poet and playwrite @entity142 four months before the incident			0
and the night before , the ' gentle ' and ' promising ' student had binged on lsd and alcohol			1
lord @entity149 , sitting with mr @entity150 and mr @entity151 , reserved judgement until next week			0
lord @entity149 said it was important to wait for the judgement of the lord chief justice in the sentences imposed on the august rioters , in case there were ' implications ' for @entity3 's case			0
he said : ' it seems likely to us that we ought to at least see what the other court has to say about disorder , generally			0
' we will reserve judgement because we need to see whether there there is any bearing on this from the judgement due in the other court			0
' @entity3 was adopted by rock star @entity3 , worth Â£ 78 million , when he married his mother , writer and journalist @entity27			0
the couple were in court to hear the appeal against their son 's sentence , but declined to comment .			0
