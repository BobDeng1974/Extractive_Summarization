by @entity0 cosmetic surgery cowboys will have ‘ nowhere to hide ’ when new rules to protect patients come into force , a health minister promised last night			1
in a victory for @entity8 , @entity6 said ‘ robust action ’ would be taken against rogue operators to safeguard those who go under the knife or opt for other treatments such as @entity13			1
nearly 50,000 women were affected after having faulty breast implants inserted , with many having them removed again as they ruptured more frequently ( pictured ) plans to make the £ 3 billion - a - year industry safer will be put before @entity20 in january			1
they include : cosmetic surgeons who have long pushed for tighter controls welcomed the proposals , but cautioned : ‘ the devil is in the detail			1
’ the plans are the government ’s official response to a @entity31 review of the industry , which was led by @entity34 medical director professor sir @entity33			2
the review was triggered by the @entity37 scandal , in which up to 47,000 women in @entity39 were fitted with the @entity41 implants made from industrial - grade silicone			1
the exact number is unclear because of chaotic record - keeping			0
it was years before anyone spotted that the implants ruptured far more frequently than other brands			2
in part , the delay in identifying the link was because there was no central register			0
most women affected then found they could not sue as firms that carried out operations either folded or called in administrators			1
dr @entity6 said : ‘ for too long , the cosmetics industry has been completely unregulated and there are too many tales of women being exploited and of lives ruined by rogue cosmetic firms			1
' this has to change , so we are taking robust action to clamp down on cosmetic cowboys to protect the public			0
’ he added : ‘ there will be nowhere to hide			1
’ sir @entity33 put forward 40 recommendations to clean up the industry and dr @entity6 said the government aims to put every one into action			1
the @entity8 has campaigned for improvements in five key areas , including minimum standards for cosmetic surgeons , an end to ‘ hard sell ’ , and full training and regulation of those administering @entity13 and dermal fillers			1
congratulating @entity8 for its ‘ vigorous ’ campaign , dr @entity87 , president of the @entity88 , said the government appeared to be acting on the first three areas , while it had not yet committed to the last two			1
but he warned : ‘ the devil is in the detail and we wait to see the full response			1
’ concerns remain about key details , such as whether the breast implant register will be compulsory			1
others remain worried ministers will bow to industry pressure and stop short of meeting our fifth demand by ensuring all those administering @entity13 , fillers and laser therapy are properly trained and registered			1
many beauty therapists carry out such work and some ‘ practitioners ’ inject clients in their own homes			1
in his review , sir @entity33 described fillers as ‘ a crisis waiting to happen ’			2
sources insisted the government ’s plans mean everyone providing such treatments will be regulated , but it may only be a voluntary scheme			0
they also claimed several cosmetic firms , including @entity121 , which fitted 13,900 women with @entity37 implants , had dragged their heels on changing their ways			2
in september 2012 , directors at @entity121 called in administrators to put the company into liquidation			0
all legal claims against the firm died with it , meaning it could not be sued by 1,700 women who had filed a class action			0
the review of rules was triggered after @entity41 company @entity138 ( @entity37 ) was found to be using industrial grade silicone in its implants directors then set up a new holding company operating from the same premises			2
lawyer @entity144 , who is fighting for compensation , said other firms acted in a similar way			0
@entity148 , who runs the @entity149 , said : ‘ everyone seems very keen to swiftly move on			0
not enough is being done for women who still have @entity37 implants			0
’ government policy in @entity154 remains that women who had implants privately can have them taken out on the @entity34 only if they have ruptured , she said			2
the @entity34 will not pay for replacements			0
the @entity121 said it had been the victim of a fraud by the @entity37 makers			0
a spokesman said it could not have survived if it had not ‘ restructured ’ to avoid the resultant liabilities			2
winding up the original company had therefore been in the best interest of patients , he said			0
@entity166 had @entity37 implants to boost her breasts – and self - esteem – after the birth of her children			0
the surgery was carried out in 2008 by @entity121			0
but an @entity172 in august 2012 revealed that one implant had ruptured while the other had developed a ‘ gel bleed ’			2
@entity176 had spread to her lymph nodes			0
although she qualifies for their removal on the @entity34 , she is not entitled to free replacement and can not afford the £ 3,500 operation			0
she is living in pain rather than face the disfigurement of not having new implants			0
miss @entity166 , 31 , of @entity185 in @entity186 , said a breast implant register was urgently needed , adding : ‘ these changes wo n’t help me or others			1

new rules for *plastic* surgeons to be put forward in january
doctors must hold @entity39 insurance and keep **log** of patient outcomes
end to *special* offers , deals and *glossy* advertising for procedures
rules wo *n't* force those who inject @entity13 to be medically trained
a register of breast operations to **log** the implants used and spot any *problems* with them .
full training to ensure that cosmetic surgeons are safe .
compulsory *indemnity* insurance to make sure that patients can sue if things go wrong .
an end to *irresponsible* advertising and offers such as ‘ *feelgood* *divorce* *packages* ’ .
