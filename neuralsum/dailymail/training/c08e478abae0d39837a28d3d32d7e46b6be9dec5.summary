by @entity0 and @entity1 last updated at 8:28 am on 12th october 2011 @entity3 enjoyed sunshine breaks with his friend thanks to flights funded by the taxpayer , it emerged last night			2
the defence secretary tagged four short foreign trips with @entity10 , who was best man at his wedding , on to official @entity14 trips			1
two of the mini-breaks were in @entity17 and two in @entity19			1
on one occasion , dr @entity3 took two days ’ annual leave to spend time with his former flatmate and self - styled ‘ adviser ’ in luxury in the @entity25 before continuing his journey to meet @entity29 troops risking their lives in @entity31			1
as the one and two - day breaks were tagged on to @entity14 trips , dr @entity3 could legitimately have his travel paid for from the public purse			1
suits and ties : dr @entity3 and mr @entity10 in @entity39 , @entity40 , on an @entity42 trip in 2008			1
right , the defence secretary , his wife @entity44 and @entity10 at a rugby club event this summer the new disclosure raised more questions about dr @entity3 ’s judgment and his dealings with mr @entity10			1
it came as mr @entity10 attempted to explain exactly how he managed to afford his air fares to meet dr @entity3 on the same visits			1
he told senior civil servants he was employed as an international networker by wealthy business donors who had an interest in politics and energy security and needed a middle - man to open doors to senior politicians			0
details of the mini-breaks emerged as : mr @entity10 was quizzed for two hours by a senior civil servant about how he paid for his extensive globetrotting ; @entity67 officials claimed mr @entity10 offered to help them buy arms during a visit with dr @entity3 ; a businessman accused dr @entity3 of telling mps ‘ half - truths ’ about their meeting with mr @entity10 and said the adviser liked to travel first - class ; @entity76 faced demands to bring in a sleaze watchdog to run the inquiry ; dr @entity3 pulled out of a press conference today in @entity81 with his @entity83 counterpart			1
dr @entity3 is under investigation by cabinet secretary sir @entity85 after it emerged that 33 - year - old mr @entity10 held 40 meetings with the defence secretary in just 16 months			1
mr @entity10 was asked to explain how , despite having little obvious income , he has been able to afford to run up an estimated bill of £ 85,000 on flights and luxury hotels since the general election			2
he has now been asked to provide bank statements to back his claims he was being bankrolled by wealthy businessmen			0
on 18 occasions since the general election the two friends met abroad and four times dr @entity3 , 50 , took leave before , in the middle or at the end of official trips to meet mr @entity10			1
luxury : @entity104 enjoyed sunshine breaks in @entity17 , left , and @entity19 , right , while he was on @entity14 trips dr @entity3 , who has in the past stayed in five - star hotels – including the 63 - storey , £ 600 - a - night address hotel in @entity17 and the @entity111 in @entity19 – paid for his own accommodation during the breaks			1
he did not pay for mr @entity10 and the @entity114 has refused to say who picked up his tab			2
the details of the trips were disclosed in a list published by the @entity114 on monday			0
sources close to the @entity121 insisted there was no additional burden on the taxpayer because he would have travelled on the routes while undertaking trips for the @entity114			0
watchdog : @entity129 dems want to call in sir @entity130 , the independent guardian of the ministerial code of conduct but if he had not had the benefit of the official flights , he would have had to pay for the flights from @entity29 from his own pocket – at a cost of around £ 10,000 in @entity139 business class			2
@entity141 mp @entity140 , who served as a major in the @entity143 in @entity144 and @entity31 , said : ‘ i find this appalling			0
the message that it sends out to our @entity147 , who are doing a fantastic job in the most difficult conditions , is that the first priority of the defence secretary is a bit of sunshine by the side of the pool rather than the well - being of troops facing danger every day			0
’ last night mr @entity10 faced serious new allegations			2
sources in @entity67 told @entity163 that he had offered to help the regime there acquire arms supplies for internal security during a visit with dr @entity3 – claims denied by the defence secretary			1
mr @entity10 also stands accused of offering to improve the regime ’s international reputation following accusations that the government there was guilty of genocide during its war with the @entity179 rebels			2
pressure intensified on the defence secretary yesterday as @entity76 faced growing calls to draft in sir @entity130 , the independent guardian of the ministerial code of conduct , to rule on whether dr @entity3 has broken the code			1
deputy prime minister @entity186 made clear he thinks dr @entity3 has broken the rules , saying ministers should observe the ‘ spirit and the letter of the ministerial code ’ and that dr @entity3 admits ‘ a blurring of the professional , political and the personal ’ in a way ‘ that raises serious issues ’			1
in private , senior @entity195 are demanding that sir @entity130 is drafted in			0
and sir @entity197 , former chairman of the @entity198 , said an ‘ independent person ’ should conduct the investigation so it would ‘ have much more public confidence ’			0
labour deputy leader @entity202 said : ‘ does n’t this show that they ’re prepared to sacrifice high standards in public office to protect the secretary of state ? ’ dr @entity3 also came under fire again from a businessman with whom he and mr @entity10 held talks in @entity17 in june			1
@entity211 , who was hoping to sell technology to the @entity214 rebels , said it was a ‘ half - truth ’ for dr @entity3 to suggest that their meeting was the result of a chance encounter with mr @entity10 in a restaurant			1
he had a meeting with mr @entity10 in april , following which the ‘ clear intention ’ was that the ‘ adviser ’ would arrange for him to see @entity104			2
he said he had assumed that mr @entity10 was a @entity14 adviser to dr @entity3			1
‘ to me he was the route to @entity3 , without a doubt , ’ mr @entity211 said			0
‘ he did disclose to me that he liked to travel first - class			2
’ he added : ‘ this appeared to be a friendship between @entity104 and @entity10 and i think @entity10 perhaps overstepped the friendship into an official role			0
i do n’t understand the motivation of dr @entity3 allowing him to do that			1
’ dr @entity3 ’s aides said mr @entity211 had changed his story and pointed out that mr @entity211 confirmed ‘ the topic of money never came up ’			1
his spokesman denied that mr @entity10 had offered to help the @entity67 acquire arms , saying : ‘ dr @entity3 ’s visits to @entity67 in opposition have been to promote post conflict reconciliation and development			1
any suggestion otherwise is without foundation and is insulting			0
’ @entity10 ’s business dealings were under scrutiny last night as questions were raised about how he financed his high - rolling lifestyle			1
on the one hand the self - styled adviser to defence secretary @entity3 was able to take at least 18 trips around the globe to meet his friend , trips which are estimated to have cost up to £ 85,000			2
but on the other it has emerged that mr @entity10 was so cash - strapped he had asked for a rent reduction on his flat in @entity259			2
mr @entity10 stunned business associates who believed he worked for the @entity114 by boasting about his generous perks , including plush hotels and first - class travel , at a time when the cash - strapped @entity266 department was implementing significant budget cuts			1
yet an investigation into the 33 - year - old ’s finances indicates that , at best , he earned around £ 55,000 a year from his businesses and consultancy firms			0
the freelance defence consultant had extraordinary access to the @entity114 – visiting 22 times – and crossed paths with the defence secretary on 18 overseas trips			0
he has flown to destinations including @entity281 , @entity17 , @entity282 , the @entity283 , @entity284 , @entity285 and @entity67 , and stayed in hotels			2
the @entity114 insisted it had not paid			0
a calculation using @entity139 prices yesterday suggested that flying economy class would cost mr @entity10 around £ 25,000 , with business class seats pushing the bill closer to £ 78,000			2
accommodation would cost an estimated £ 7,000 based on £ 200 - a - night rooms – a total of £ 85,000			0
@entity296 sources warned that sir @entity85 , the country ’s top civil servant , would be faced with figures that did not add up when he investigated the @entity300 ’s background			0
mr @entity10 pays an estimated rent of more than £ 2,500 a month for his flat in @entity303 , a short walk from the @entity305			0
last night a source told the @entity307 : ‘ mr @entity10 has tried to get the agents to reduce the rent on the property but has been told that it is not possible			0
’ mr @entity10 has run a string of companies			0
he started @entity314 when dr @entity3 was shadow health secretary but this was dissolved and he founded @entity316 in 2006 after his friend moved to the defence brief			1
this company ceased trading last year but its last accounts revealed a pre-tax profit of just £ 4,000			0
mr @entity10 also started @entity323 in 2007 but the latest accounts show an £ 8,000 loss last year			0
his other company is @entity327 was formed in february			0
another venture is the @entity329 and @entity330 , a think - tank founded by dr @entity3 in 1997			1
mr @entity10 was the sole employee of the charity , which was wound up last month after the @entity333 ruled it was not meeting its ‘ charitable purposes ’			0
the charity ’s accounts show it paid £ 37,000 for an annual salary to an unnamed individual			0
it also paid consultancy fees of £ 87,738 over three years to mr @entity10 .			0

dr @entity3 and @entity10 took luxury stays in @entity19 and @entity17 while on @entity14 trips
questions surface over how @entity10 could afford first - class *jet* - set lifestyle
@entity10 offered @entity67 regime help to buy arms while on a trip with dr @entity3 , say officials
*urgent* demands for *parliamentary* watchdog to be called in for investigation
