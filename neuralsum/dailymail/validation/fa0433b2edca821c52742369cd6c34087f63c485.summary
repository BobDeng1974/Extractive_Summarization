@entity4 have not been crowned league champions since 1990 and save for last season 's surprise charge , have sparsely been involved in the title mix for the past few years			1
@entity0 told @entity12 , ' if i had told you in 1990 that @entity4 would not win the title in the next 25 years , you would have taken me for a madman			1
i do n't want the same thing to happen to @entity1			2

while that gap might prove insurmountable at this late stage of the season , @entity0 is confident that the current crop of @entity33 players could be developed to push for the title soon			1
he said , ' this year , we 're not so far off			0
with the exception of the first leg against @entity39 , they are on the right track , but they undoubtedly dropped too many points at the start of the season			0

having made little secret of his ambition to move into management following the end of his playing career in december last year , @entity0 has been one of the names touted to replace @entity60 in the @entity1 dug - out , and is presently helping to coach the club 's academy players			1
however , the @entity72 insists that he is happy in his current role for now and just wants to learn the trade before targeting the top job			2
