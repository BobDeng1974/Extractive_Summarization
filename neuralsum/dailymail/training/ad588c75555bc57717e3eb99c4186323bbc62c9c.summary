@entity1 astronauts are already blasting off to the @entity2 on @entity4 rockets			1
but now the @entity5 is weighing a plan to use @entity8 - based satellites to route @entity1 's 911 emergency phone calls			1
@entity10 , already skittish about trusting the @entity12 regime as it airs its expansionist desires through @entity14 , fear the @entity4 leader would gain access to real - time information about emergency responders in every corner of the @entity1			2
that data , piped through @entity4 's @entity22 precision navigation and timing satellite system , already allows police , fire and rescue crews to pinpoint cellphone callers ' locations			1
national security alarms are going off , and they 're as loud as fire bells			0
@entity32 @entity31 rep. @entity31 , who chairs am armed services subcommittee on strategic forces , wrote to warn defense secretary @entity35 and director of national intelligence @entity36			1
from moscow with love : @entity4 satellites could soon carry the navigation signals that help first responders locate 911 cellphone callers in the @entity1 @entity43 : @entity45 hawks fret that @entity4 president @entity12 could collect data showing where @entity1 emergency response crews are located in the event of a military confrontation ' in view of the threat posed to the world by @entity4 's @entity12 , it can not be seriously considered that the @entity1 would rely on a system in that dictator 's control for its wireless 911 location capability , ' @entity31 wrote , in a letter first reporter by the @entity60			1
' our response to @entity4 's hybrid warfare , arms control cheating , illegal invasions of sovereign nations , and energy - based extortion must be broad - based isolation and counter-leverage			1
' a trade group that worked on the plan with major wireless phone carriers – including @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 and @entity76 – disagrees			2
@entity77 , government affairs director at the @entity78 , said there 's no @entity1 satellite system that can cover enough ground on its own without help from @entity22			1
his group worked with the companies and the @entity85 ( @entity85 ) to develop a way to give police , firefighters and medics better tools to locate people in time to help them when seconds count			0
' our view is that we ought to be leveraging anything that is available to find someone in an emergency , ' @entity94 told the @entity60			0
@entity85 says rep. @entity31 is overreacting based on ' plainly false statements that stretch the imagination to try to make a case that the roadmap 's inclusion of @entity22 for location determination presents a security threat			1
' that stark condemnation came from the association 's government relations chief , @entity109 , in a dec. 24 letter to the @entity5			0
@entity32 rep. @entity31 is warning the @entity5 that it should n't let cellphone companies route 911 calls through satellites under the control of the @entity4 @entity22 itself is an alternative gps system operated by 24 satellites , with 4 more planned			1
in april 2014 the entire system went offline for a half - day , leading everyone from @entity4 military planes to commercial shippers to generate incorrect location data – which was in some cases off by more than 50 kilometers			1
@entity126 , a state - funded news outlet , reports that @entity8 began developing @entity22 in 1976 and reached the point where it could cover the entire planet 's surface in 1995			2
a total of 19 ground stations collect satellite data for consumer applications , providing signals with accuracy up to one meter			0
' three more stations are located in the @entity139 and one in @entity141 , ' according to @entity126 , ' with two more to be constructed in @entity142 and one in @entity144			0
' yesterday su - 25 fighter jets carried test modules over the skies of northern @entity148 on practice runs to demonstrate its military applications			0
it 's the largest and only comprehensive gps - workalike system in existence , according to @entity4 media outlets , which also report that its underlying technology has been shared with @entity157 and @entity144			2
sprint sait it aims to minimize the degree to which @entity1 companies rely on the @entity4 satellites			2
' the roadmap does not envision that carriers will rely exclusively on the @entity22 system , ' the company 's government affairs director @entity162 wrote on dec. 24 to @entity5 officials			2
' rather , the roadmap advocates taking advantage of a tool that is available now to allow carriers to improve location information			0
' comrade communications : @entity4 's gps - workalike satellites could guide big - city firetrucks to their destinations – or not , if the software fails again , or if @entity4 controllers decide to monkeywrench it @entity22 is powered by more than two dozen geosynchronous - orbiting satellites launched on @entity4 rockets since the 1970s the @entity5 has the authority to green - light or spike the proposal , but has n't chosen a path forward yet			1
a january 29 meeting , however , could bring the issue to a head			0
retired rear admiral @entity188 , chief of the @entity5 's @entity190 and @entity189 , said his agency is ' committed to protecting both public safety and national security as we continue to examine the input and issues in the proceeding , and will coordinate with our colleagues across the government to ensure that national security needs are addressed			0
' the @entity201 has found itself blind - sided in the past by concerns about handing @entity4 the keys to @entity1 - based signals intelligence			1
in 2013 the @entity206 said it was considering giving @entity207 – the @entity208 – clearance to erect six buildings in the @entity1 outfitted with with antennas and signal processing electronics			0
members of @entity214 were outraged and wrote special language into the 2014 @entity216 forbidding such deals with foreign nations .			0

@entity4 's own gps system covers more ground than @entity1 satellites , so wireless phone companies want to leverage it to help locate 911 callers
rep. @entity31 , an @entity32 @entity228 , is furious and says the move could give signals intelligence to an antagonistic @entity4
' @entity22 ' is a @entity4 satellite network that has been able to see the whole planet since 1995
part of its software *crashed* for a half - day last april , generating navigation signals that were off by as much as 50 kilometers
