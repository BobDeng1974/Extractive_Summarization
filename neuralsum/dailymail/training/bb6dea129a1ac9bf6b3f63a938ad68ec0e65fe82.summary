scientists in @entity1 have warned that eating monkeys and apes could cause the next hiv			1
they are already tracking a @entity4 - like virus called simian foamy virus , and fear more viruses could spread and lead to a global health crisis			1
80 per cent of the meat eaten in @entity1 is killed in the wild and is known as ‘ bushmeat ’ , with gorilla , chimpanzee or monkey favourites			1
chimps in @entity1 : 80 per cent of the meat eaten in @entity1 is killed in the wild and is known as ' bushmeat ' , with gorilla , chimpanzee or monkey favourites @entity19 snub - nosed monkey : monkeys and apes are targets for bushmeat - and scientists worry viruses could spread to humans according to oneestimate , up to 3,000 gorillas are slaughtered in southern @entity1 every year			1
elsewhere , the @entity29 - based @entity28 estimates that up to five milliontons of wild animals are being ‘ harvested ’ in the @entity34 every year – the equivalent of 10 million cattle			2
a study earlier this year by the @entity36 ( @entity36 ) , identified evidence of viruses , including simian foamy virus , in illegally imported wildlife products confiscated at several @entity42 international airports , including @entity43 , @entity44 and @entity45			2
@entity46 , headvet at the primate sanctuary @entity48 ( @entity49 ) , in @entity50 , just outside the @entity1 capital @entity52 , has spotted the virus in animals brought to his sanctuary			1
the @entity49 cares for22 gorillas and more than one hundred chimps which are orphans of the bush meat trade			0
mr @entity46 tests the blood of all apes arriving at the sanctuary			0
he says he has recently detected the simian foamy virus , which is closely related to @entity4 , in the apes			1
a dish prepared with bushmeat : scientists worry that @entity4 - like viruses could jump between species due to the trade in the meat ‘ a recent surveyc onfirmed this is now in humans , especially in some of those who are huntersand cutting up the apes in the south - east of the country , ’ he said			1
he also believes that ebola may be present , and caused a recent mass death in a nearby village			2
‘ in the village of @entity83 our brothers found a dead gorilla in the forest , ’ said @entity79 , a village elder			0
‘ they took it back to the village and ate the meat			0
almost immediately , everyone died – 25 men , women and children – the only person whodid n't was a woman who did n't eat the meat			0
’ professor @entity97 , the director of the @entity98 in @entity52 , @entity1 ’s capital , says he is concerned viruses could quickly spread			2
he says that the deeper poachers go in to the forest , and the more that primates are consumed , the more exposed people become to new unknown viruses and the more potential there is for the viruses to mutate into potentially aggressive forms			0
government researchers admit they do not know what the long term effects of @entity110 in humansare , and the @entity113 government recently said they are not even sure how it is transmitted			0
‘ the exact method of transmission has n't been confirmed , but there are indications that the virus may be transmitted through exposure to blood , saliva and other bodily fluids from affected animals , ’ it said .			0

80 *%* of meat eaten in @entity1 is bushmeat including gorilla and chimp
@entity4 - like virus called ' @entity134 ' could jump to humans , say researchers
hunters become *infected* with @entity140 virus
meat has also caused mass deaths *possibly* due to @entity144
