by @entity0 and @entity1 police in @entity3 and @entity4 broke up a major trans - @entity6 mafia ring on tuesday , arresting 24 people accused of plotting to move hundreds of millions of dollars in drugs between @entity10 , @entity3 and the @entity11			1
the sting operation involving undercover agents and wire taps offered more evidence the @entity17 - based ' @entity16 had overtaken its @entity19 cousin , the @entity20 , and was trying to make inroads in the @entity11 by forging ties with one of the traditional @entity4 mob families , the @entity25			1
@entity27 and @entity3 agents jointly carried out ' @entity28 ' simultaneously just after midnight in @entity29 and just before dawn in @entity3 , @entity10 and @entity3 officials told a news conference in @entity33			1
the clans of the @entity16 , a version of the @entity20 on the southern mainland , and members of the @entity78 family in @entity4 , were in the advanced stages of plans to smuggle some 500 kg ( 1,000 pounds ) of pure cocaine from @entity82 in @entity10 to the port of @entity84 in @entity17			1
@entity3 investigators estimated the street value of the cocaine after cutting at about $ 1 billion			1
the drugs , supplied by @entity90 drug cartels , were to have been sent to @entity3 hidden in shipments of canned fruit			2
some of it would then have been smuggled to the @entity11			0
' the ' @entity16 determined to move deadly narcotics across international boundaries , attempting to build a bridge of criminality and corruption to stretch from @entity10 to @entity3 and back to @entity4 , ' said assistant @entity11 attorney @entity99			1
@entity100 : the @entity63 crime family was once headed by notorious @entity4 mobster @entity100 and later by his son @entity102 the @entity63 crime family is one of what is widely referred to as ' @entity104 ' of @entity3 organized crime operations in @entity4 and other parts of the @entity11			1
the @entity63 's rise to become one of the most powerful mafia families in @entity10 started in 1957 , when the family 's namesake , @entity63 - an @entity3 immigrant - orchestrated the murder of @entity114 , who had organized a collection of @entity3 gangs into what now would be considered a ' crime family			1
' @entity63 headed the organization until 1976 , when he handed power over to his brother - in - law @entity121			0
like other mafia families , the @entity25 took their methods from the crime families in @entity3 - @entity125 - and were involved in illegal activities like loan - sharking , extortion , prostitution , gambling and money laundering - as well as the frequent assaults and murders associated with those types of business ventures			2
in 1985 , @entity63 ' capo ' @entity100 orchestrated the murder of @entity121 to become the most publicized boss of the family			0
@entity100 's reign came to an end when his underboss , @entity141 ' @entity142 agreed to testify against him and other members of the family in a 1992 @entity145 trial			0
since @entity100 's downfall , the @entity25 - and other mafia families - have lost much of the power they once had over politicians , judges and labor unions			0
it is believed that the family is now headed by @entity153 , who lives in @entity29			0
he told reporters at a news conference at the headquarters of @entity3 's anti-mafia investigators with other @entity11 and @entity3 investigators that the operation struck at ' the heart of international organized crime			2

an undercover agent was dispatched to @entity3 and was successful in infiltrating the clan			2

the @entity27 and @entity3 investigators intercepted email messages between mobsters in @entity3 and the @entity186 fruit canning company in @entity187 , @entity82			1
during the investigation police wire taps indicated the group was also considering arms trafficking on a considerable scale but that plan never moved beyond the initial stages			0
' rat ' : mob turncoat @entity141 ' @entity142 helped put a dent in the @entity63 crime enterprise , but it still exists today investigators say that in recent years ' ndrangheta clans have made inroads in criminal activity in northern @entity3 and elsewhere in @entity202 , particularly in @entity203 and now want to expand in the @entity11			0
' what we see here is ' @entity16 attempting to gain a foothold in the @entity4 area and the @entity11 , ' @entity99 said			0
' we also see efforts to forge cooperation between the ' @entity16 and the @entity20 , ' he said .			0
