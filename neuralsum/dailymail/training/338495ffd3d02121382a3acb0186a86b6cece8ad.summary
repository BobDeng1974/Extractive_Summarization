to hear you have been badly behaved can be distressing enough for a child , but to hear it from @entity3 himself is enough to upset anyone			0
that 's what happened to @entity8 , 8 , and @entity9 , 4 , after receiving a letter from ' @entity11 ' telling them that they were on the naughty list - and might not be receiving any presents			1
@entity16 , from @entity17 in @entity18 , devised the elaborate plan to encourage her children to behave on the run up to @entity3			2
@entity16 , pictured with @entity8 and @entity9 , who are behaving well after receiving the letter from ' @entity11 ' the married mother - of - three wrote a letter posing as @entity11 , addressed it to two of her children @entity8 , @entity9 , but not @entity26 , who is only one , and filmed @entity8 reading it out loud			1
in the footage , the young boy can be heard reading how @entity3 had been ' watching ' them for ' two weeks ' and was ' certain ' that both @entity8 and @entity9 would be on his ' naughty list '			1
' you have not been good children , ' he writes and gives them ' 13 sleeps ' to turn the situation around			1
@entity9 , 4 , @entity8 , 8 , and @entity26 , 1 ( left to right ) during happier times sitting in front of a christmas tree ' if you do not start behaving you will not receive the lovely presents i have for you both , ' he ends			1
@entity8 and his younger sister @entity9 looked crushed in the video , as the boy 's voice quivers as he reads out the letter			1
as he is reading , the little blonde - haired girl , dressed in a pink dressing gown , hugs her legs and looks upset , saying : ' we ca n't be on his naughty list ! ' he continues reading as the @entity9 cries in the background , rubbing her eyes			1
the offending letter was typed up by the children 's mother and put in a stocking by the chimney dear @entity8 and @entity9 , i have been watching you for the last few weeks and i am certain that you will both be on my naughty list			1
you have not been good children			2
i can see you have been fighting with each other and not treating each other well			0
this has made me feel extremely disappointed			0
i am also not impressed with the lack of listening you do @entity9 and the attitude you have at the moment @entity8			0
you have 13 sleeps to change this			1
i will be watching you both very very closely in a hope i can change you to the nice list			2
if you do not start behaving you will not receive the lovely presents i have for you both			2
remember only good children are on the nice list			2
i hope to see you on christmas eve			0
@entity11 at the end of the letter , @entity8 and his sister look up at their mother , and the little boy throws the the piece of paper on the floor sobbing : ' what are you looking at us like that for - it makes me upset ! the mother says : ' you have 13 days to improve			1
' to which @entity8 says , indicating to his sister : ' i know , but she keeps annoying me ! ' and i ca n't just stop her , ' he adds , his face trembling and his arms crossed in front of him			2
' we can work on this together , ' the mother tells them , to which @entity9 says : ' i do n't want to be on the naughty list			2
' @entity16 , who lives with her husband @entity98 , 32 , said in her defence : ' from the moment they wake up , to the moment they go to sleep they ’re fighting with each other , arguing and annoying one another			0
' i wrote the letter and put it in the stocking that is hanging on the chimney , @entity9 was so excited when she found it and came running in at quarter to six , " mummy , mummy , a letter from @entity11 "			1
' @entity8 opened the letter and that ’s when i started filming			0
it ’s not that i did n’t think he would take it seriously , but i just thought he ’d brush it off			0
@entity119 is heartbroken that he is on the naughty list and that @entity3 might not bring him gifts upset : @entity8 starts to cry and his little sister @entity9 wipes her eyes after hearing the news ' when he started crying i felt like crying with him but i was just trying to focus on saying encouraging things about their behaviour			1
' after reading the letter they were amazing , like angels , @entity8 helped @entity9 get dressed and even held her hand on the way to school which was a big improvement			2
' usually you have to tell @entity9 10 times to get dressed , but that morning i only had to ask her once			0
' i do feel bad though , and when we got to school i went in to talk to the teacher to tell her what i ’d done in case he got upset in class ! ' @entity16 , who works for @entity141 , said the letter has had the desired effect			0
' he 's always watching ' : @entity16 with @entity98 and their three children @entity26 , @entity8 and @entity9 visiting @entity11 ' one day on and their behaviour has been amazing - completely different to before they received the letter , ' she said			1
' they normally fight like cat and dog from the minute they wake up , but this morning @entity8 helped @entity9 get dressed and walk her to school			0
and after school they played nicely together - they even wrote their @entity3 cards together			0
' we have left the letter from @entity11 on the side so they can see it			1
' if they start to argue , we point to it and say " remember , he 's always watching "			0
' my husband was n't there when @entity8 read out the letter , but the next morning they came and told him about it			0
my husband told them that they need to buck their ideas up			0
