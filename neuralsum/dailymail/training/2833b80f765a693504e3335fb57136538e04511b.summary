the intrepid photographer has dedicated years of his life to his aquatic ambition in a bid to showcase the beauty of the world beneath the sea			1
gorgeous : a blue - eyed triplefin fish , whose latin name is @entity23 captured on camera in @entity25 by @entity27 photographer @entity9 looming : an oceanic white tip shark swimming past a diver in this stunning picture taken by photographer @entity9 who travel the world capturing life beneath the waves on film unique : manatees in @entity37 , whose latin name is @entity39 , in clear water with one turning towards the photographer allowing a perfect picture of its strange thick wrinkled skin the daring photographer , 50 , regularly delves into the depths of the unknown coming face to face with southern right whales and notorious predators including the oceanic white - tip shark			1
@entity9 , from @entity50 , @entity51 , began scuba diving when he was just 13 - years - old and quickly fell in love with the ocean			1
he bought his first underwater camera two years later and has been exploring and photographing the world 's oceans ever since			2
he said : ' i 'm mostly an ocean explorer , i think there 's something mystical about the ocean and i 've been drawn to it from a very early age			2
' underwater photography is extremely challenging , you ca n't use a telescopic lens you need to get up close to your subjects , light is tricky and you are working in an alien environment			2
brave : @entity27 photographer @entity9 gets to travel to amazing locations , but as this picture of his boat surrounded by aggressive @entity76 , he faces many risks swimming alongside the worlds most dangerous sea creatures fearsome : an @entity81 shark in the outer islands of the @entity83 captured by the intrepid photographer has its next meal is about to disappear between its huge jaws and into its cavernous mouth majestic : while most people would run a mile , photographer @entity9 was determined to get up close and personal with these @entity92 in the @entity83 to get these close up shots glides : a short - tailed stingray , which is usually found off @entity96 and can grow to more than 6ft wide , swimming through an underwater canyon ' but there 's something stunning about underwater photos , the ocean is like a giant kaleidoscope it 's always changing and you can capture some of that through pictures			1
' @entity9 now spends his life traveling across the globe in search of the most beautiful sea life			1
he sometimes spends up to two to three months on location exploring and photographing the everything from @entity113 in @entity37 to harp seals in the @entity115			1
and he has recently written a book called @entity117 which documents his underwater experiences and discoveries over the last 35 years			0
@entity9 said he finds exploring and photographing the ocean a challenging yet humbling experience			2
@entity123 eye : a brightly coloured fish captured peeking out of a rusted old soft drinks can that had settled on the sea bed provided @entity9 with another opportunity to capture a beautiful picture beneath the waves : it can take months in each location searching for the perfect pictures , the most impressive fish and best reefs to achieve @entity9 's impressive results he said : ' you never know how things are going to go with animals underwater			1
to be in the presence of a giant whale , a shark or a seal is quite humbling			0
' they are allowing you to get very close to them , the animal is tolerating you , it 's curious about you			0
' i think all the animals i photograph have a curiosity about me , i hope i give a vibe which is n't intimidating			0
' but there 's always a healthy fear inside of me and i need to be cautious and wise , because after all these are wild animals			0
' it 's amazing and wonderful to be in the presence of these animals and it 's a huge testament to them to let me get so close			0
' you have to listen to the voice inside of you and the vibe you get from an animal			0
there 's always other dangers too , your equipment could malfunction or you could lose your exit hole when diving beneath the ice in the arctic			0
' but i 'm always trying to do what i can to prepare , i try to do as much homework i can to understand the behaviour of the animals i 'll encounter and the conditions and dangers of the place i 'm photographing			0
' scale : a huge 50 tonne @entity177 in waters off the @entity179 in @entity25 which despite its size is not aggressive to people			0

@entity27 photographer @entity9 spends months at the best locations to get the perfect shots
