another day and more disappointment from the effect that poor officiating is having on this @entity4 season			0
@entity5 , @entity6 and @entity7 who were all in the top 5 before play started were all victims whilst close rivals @entity12 and @entity13 were beneficiaries			2
penalties , dives and offsides were called incorrectly as we reached the halfway point of a wholly unsatisfactory season from too many select group officials			0
@entity5 players , in particular @entity22 , were rightly upset with @entity25 's decision on sunday @entity26 and @entity27 complain to referee @entity28 after @entity26 's strike was disallowed @entity32 let 's @entity31 's flick slip through his hands , but the @entity35 man should have been flagged offside @entity36 inexplicably missed @entity38 's elbow on @entity39 during @entity40 vs @entity41 @entity38 went on to score @entity40 's first goal , which made it 1 - 1 , but is likely to face a ban for the violence whilst the @entity38 incident does not affect the top 6 it was the worst offence of the day for which he will be banned retrospectively by the @entity50 for his outrageous elbow			1
the more times you see what can only be described as an assault by the @entity59 striker the worse it gets but had @entity36 seen it , and i wonder how he did n’t , he would have dismissed him and a standard ban applied which is what the @entity50 must apply			0
the most controversial was the caution for @entity22 who will have that yellow card against his name which could result in a ban and the football association must be pressed to review this process			0
@entity22 is clearly caught by @entity71 , causing him to go down in the @entity12 penalty area @entity73 can not believe the decision to deny him a penalty and book him for diving - the @entity50 should overturn it i have called for referees to be given more training and advice regarding simulation which needs to come from within the game as players and managers understand this offence far better than officials			1
@entity7 ’s ‘ goal ’ from @entity26 provides the best debate for the day			1
it was a superb strike from @entity26 which @entity90 can not see due to a cluster of players from both teams			2
there were three @entity7 players in offside positions as @entity26 kicked the ball but all three were running out , ‘ disassociating themselves from play ’ and so not deemed to be interfering with play			2
@entity26 's strike should have been given as the @entity7 players were ' disassociating themselves from play ’ @entity104 , who ran over the ball , was clearly not in @entity90 's line of sight when @entity26 shot the ball travels towards the corner of the goal where @entity104 jumps over it and as he is not in the line of sight of the goalkeeper he is not interfering with the ‘ keeper			1
replays from behind the goal show that @entity27 could be in @entity90 ’s line of sight hence the assistant ’s raised flag but it ’s a goal that i would have wanted to stand			0
so , not a great day for officials although to be fair @entity125 was correct with bot dismissals at @entity127 as was @entity128 in sending off @entity129 for an over the top tackle at @entity131 so it was n’t all bad			0
@entity128 was right to send off @entity134 's @entity133 for a tackle than went over the ball @entity125 was spot on with both his red cards , dismissing @entity139 and @entity140 remember that on @entity143 were denied a clear penalty ( @entity145 on @entity146 ) , @entity141 should have had two penalties for handball against @entity127 ( @entity149 and @entity140 ) , @entity150 should have been cautioned for diving , @entity40 should have had an early penalty when @entity153 tripped @entity154 and @entity156 ’s @entity155 should have been dismissed for pulling @entity41 ’s @entity157 when clean through on goal .			1

@entity22 booking for diving against @entity161 was a travesty
@entity7 were very *unlucky* to see @entity26 's wonder - strike ruled out
@entity38 should have see red for his elbow on @entity39
@entity22 was clearly tripped by @entity71 and should have been *awarded* a penalty ; instead he was cautioned by @entity25 which was a travesty .
@entity26 scored a superb goal which was disallowed by referee @entity28 under advice from his assistant , @entity174 .
@entity6 were *comfortably* 2 - 0 up when @entity35 scored a goal to get themselves back into the game but the scorer , @entity31 was clearly in an offside position .
@entity41 will *rue* referee @entity36 somehow missing @entity38 clearly and *viciously* elbow @entity39 whilst *waiting* for a corner at @entity182 *–* @entity38 , who was offside in the build up to the next corner , then scored the first goal for @entity40 .
@entity187 missing @entity188 clearly holding @entity190 ’s @entity189 to prevent him from competing for the ball at a set piece . a clear penalty which could have led to the only goal of the game .
