the first flying cars are set to go on sale to the public as early as 2015			1
@entity3 has announced its transition design , which is part sedan , part private jet with two seats , four wheels and wings that fold up so it can be driven like a car , will be on sale in less than two years			1
the @entity14 - based firm has also unveiled plans for a @entity17 model that will be small enough to fit in a garage , and wo n't need a runway to take off			1
@entity3 announced today that it 's working on the @entity17 , a flying car that can take - off from standing still , and is hoping it will be available within 12 years motorised rotors attached to the wings of the @entity17 , announced today , make it possible to take off from standing still			1
this means cars could switch from driving to flying when they encounter traffic			2
however , the wingspan requires a diameter of 100 feet to do so the transition can reach speeds of around 70 miles per hour on the road and 115 in the air			1
it flies using a 23 - gallon tank of automotive fuel and burns 5 gallons per hour in the air			1
on the ground , it gets 35 miles per gallon			2
it has rear - wheel drive when on the road			1
the transition comes with two passenger airbags , and a full - vehicle parachute			1
last year , the @entity51 successfully flew at 1,400 feet for eight minutes			2
commercial jets fly at 35,000 feet			0
however , it will not be cheap - the transition will cost £ 190,000 ( $ 300,000 ) and @entity3 says owners must have pilot 's licenses , and will need to pass a test plus complete 20 hours of flying time to be able to fly the car			1
despite the advances in technology the transition demonstrates , critics have said that it is still not the vision of flying cars seen in many sci - fi films			1
to answer these critics , @entity3 has now also released designs for a @entity17 - @entity71 of its transition range			1
the transition flying car , built by @entity3 , making a banking turn in the sky above @entity14			1
the car flew for eight minutes at 1,400 feet during test flights last year , before completing the public flights in @entity79 in july this shot shows the transition plane switching from drive mode to fly mode			1
the wings fold into the side of the car , built from a @entity88 design			0
drivers can only take off in the transition from a runway			1
the transition has a maximum flight speed of 115mph a @entity3 test pilot fills up the transition flying car with petrol			1
the transition can hold 23 gallons of usable fuel and uses 5 gallons per hour during flight			2
on the ground , it gets 35 miles per gallon whereas the transition requires a runway , the @entity17 can take off from a vertical position because of motorised rotors on the wings			1
these rotors will work in a similar way to helicopter rotors			0
being able to take off from standstill means owners will be able to go from the road to the air straight from their driveways , car parks and even when stuck in traffic			0
although you will still need at least 100 feet in diameter in order to open the wings			0
according to @entity3 , the vehicle will carry four people ' in car - like comfort '			2
it is expected to be able to fly , nonstop , for 500 miles			0
when the @entity17 - a new flying car design announced by @entity14 - based firm @entity3 - is in drive mode , the wings fold into the side of the car and the rotors , which make it possible to take off in the @entity17 from standing still , also fold away and tuck into the chassis when the wings are folded away , the @entity17 will be small enough to fit in a single - car garage			1
@entity3 announced plans for the @entity17 today and is hoping it will be road - ready in 12 years the @entity17 model has not been tested yet , and prices have n't been announced			1
@entity3 hopes to have working models of the @entity136 available for sale within eight to 12 years			2
like with the transition , you will need 20 hours of flying and a pilot 's licence to drive it , though			2
the flying car has always had a special place in the @entity147 imagination			0
inventors have been trying to make them since the 1930s , according to @entity151 , an airline industry analyst who owns @entity152 in @entity153 , @entity154			0
but @entity151 thinks @entity3 has come closer than anyone to making the flying cars a reality			0
the government has already granted the company 's request to use special tires and glass that are lighter than normal automotive ones , to make it easier for the vehicle to fly			0
when its not soaring in the air , the @entity51 's wings fold up , pictured , to make it a road - ready two - seat car special rules : the federal government has eased certain regulations to allow vehicles like the transition to come closer to reality the government has also temporarily exempted the transition from the requirement to equip vehicles with electronic stability control , which would add about six pounds to the vehicle			1
@entity151 said @entity3 was helped by the @entity181 's decision five years ago to create a separate set of standards for light sport aircraft			0
the standards govern the size and speed of the plane and licensing requirements for pilots , which are less restrictive than requirements for pilots of larger planes			0
inventors and engineers have been working on the flying car concept since the 1930s			0
here , a 1947 @entity197 is seen in flight unholy alliance : the 1973 @entity200 attached a @entity202 airframe to a @entity203			0
its inventor was killed when the wings collapsed during a test flight the 1930s @entity207 , pictured , was the first simple flying car to successfully be produced			0
a total of five were built and flown @entity151 questions the size of the market for the transition			2
the general aviation market has been in decline for two decades , he said , largely because of fuel costs and the high cost of liability for manufacturers			0
also , fewer people are learning how to fly			0
' this is not going to be an inexpensive aircraft to produce or market , ' he said			0
' it has some uniqueness , and will get some sales , but the question is , could it ever be a profitable enterprise ? ' @entity151 sees the western @entity147 as the most likely market , where people could fly instead of driving long distances			0
@entity3 has been working on flying cars since 2006 , and has already pushed back the launch once			0
last summer the company said it would have to delay expected 2011 deliveries due to design challenges and problems with parts suppliers .			2

the £ 190,000 ( $ 300,00 ) transition is part - sedan , part - private jet and is due to go on sale in 2015
designers have also released plans for a @entity17 model that can vertically take off from a standing position
