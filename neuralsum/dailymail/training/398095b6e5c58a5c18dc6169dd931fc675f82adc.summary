experts may be concerned that a faulty thruster on the @entity3 lander could potentially scupper the @entity5 mission , but its lead scientist is so confident of success that he already has the triumphant moment of landing tattooed on his leg			1
@entity12 scientist dr @entity11 is one of the most important people involved in the @entity15 's mission to land on a comet for the first time and has become a @entity19 sensation			1
the @entity20 has caused a stir on the social network because of his unorthodox appearance , involving bright shirts and an array of body art - including a tattoo on his leg of the space probe landing on the comet , which he got in january			1
he told @entity43 : ‘ i 'm incredibly confident that we 're going to nail this landing			0
i 'm confident enough to have it drawn on my body			0
’ as he showed off the design on his right thigh , dr @entity11 said : ‘ that 's my prediction for later today , that we get the lander on the comet			1
’ the scientist is so positive that the mission to land on the comet will be successful that he has already had the moment permanently etched on his body ( pictured ) earlier this morning , @entity15 's @entity5 probe released its @entity3 lander to attempt the first ever landing of a spacecraft on the surface of a comet			1
the separation was confirmed at 9.03am gmt , with pictures of @entity3 approaching the comet expected throughout the day before it lands on the surface at 3.30pm gmt. but the success of the mission now hangs in the balance after a thruster on @entity3 was found to be faulty			1
mission controllers say there is a 50 per cent chance the cold thruster positioned on top of the lander will work , and without it , @entity3 will have to rely solely on harpoons to attach to the surface of the comet			1
the cold thruster was designed to push @entity3 closer to the comet			2
dr @entity11 , the son of a brick layer , was reportedly told to cover his tattoos at media events in the past , but his appearance seems only to have increased his popularity			2
@entity19 users praised dr @entity11 for being ‘ a proper cool scientist ’ and ‘ definitely not boring ’ after he appeared on the @entity15 live stream and @entity43 wearing a multi-coloured shirt emblazoned with illustrations of glamorous women , which he teamed with shorts , which showed off his tattoos			1
to convince his new team of his dedication , dr @entity11 promised that if @entity5 woke up from its hibernation , he would get a tattoo to commemorate the event			1
this video shows the creation of the tattoo @entity15 has successfully made contact with the @entity3 lander after it separated from the @entity5 spacecraft this morning at 08.35am gmt. it is now heading towards the comet and is expected to attempt to land on the surface at 4pm gmt. pictured right is @entity105 , @entity106 , celebrating making contact when @entity3 touches the surface of the comet it will fire harpoons into the surface to keep it anchored there			1
to keep it attached to the surface a thruster at the top will push it down as the harpoons fire			0
but at the moment the thruster does not appear to be working			0
this means the lander will have to rely solely on its harpoons to stay attached to the surface			2
it will have to hope they grab the surface immediately and keep the lander anchored there			0
if they do n’t , the force of firing them could send it floating off into space			0
' we ’ll need some luck not to land on a boulder or a steep slope , ’ said @entity134 , @entity135 at the @entity136			0
one @entity19 user wrote : ' dr @entity11 is what every scientist should look like - rad shirt , sleeve tattoos			1
rad , ' while another said : ‘ @entity11 causing thousands of people to choke on their cornflakes this morning			0
’ dr @entity11 studied at the @entity146 and @entity147 , winning a phd in space plasma physics he has worked at the @entity15 since 2005 and was given the top scientific job on the mission in the summer of 2013			1
the role was a real change from his previous job , which was studying the physics of the northern lights , @entity152 reported			0
professor @entity158 , senior science advisor at @entity15 , who appointed dr @entity11 , said that he took a chance on the young scientist as he would have to come up to speed with the mission quickly and gain the trust of older experts who had been working at @entity15 for decades			2
to convince them of his dedication , dr @entity11 promised that if @entity5 woke up from its hibernation , he would get a tattoo to commemorate the event			2
in january this happened , and a school friend turned tattoo artist etched a reminder of the ambitious mission on his leg			0
in his profile on the @entity178 website , dr @entity11 says : ‘ the opportunity to work on @entity5 was huge and i can not begin to describe the excitement associated with this mission			2
it really is just so cool			0
’ @entity5 has chased comet @entity182 – @entity183 through space for more than ten years in what has been described as ' the sexiest , most fantastic mission ever '			0
after a four billion mile ( 6.5 billion km ) journey , it is now positioned in an orbit 19 miles ( 30 km ) away from @entity190			0

dr @entity11 is the @entity20 at the @entity15
he *trended* on @entity19 after a tv appearance this morning , where he wore a colourful shirt and shorts , which showed off his array of tattoos
one tattoo shows the @entity3 lander touching down on the comet - although the success of the @entity5 mission is currently hanging in the balance
he is so confident of the mission 's success he got inked in january
@entity3 has been released but has a *damaged* thruster , meaning it will have to rely solely on harpoons to attach to the surface of the comet
