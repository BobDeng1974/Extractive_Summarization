@entity0 was yesterday embroiled in a new war of words over showing @entity3 in schools – with one of the programme ’s stars			1
sir @entity8 , asked to weigh in to the row over whether the tv comedy should be used in lessons about the @entity12 , branded mr @entity0 ‘ very silly ’			1
the actor , who played the @entity14 in the long - running series , refused to accept mr @entity0 ’s claims that it would feed pupils ‘ left - wing myths ’ about the 1914 - 18 conflict			1
sir @entity8 , asked to weigh in to the row over whether the tv comedy should be used in lessons about the @entity12 , branded mr @entity0 ' very silly ' writing in the @entity23 last week , mr @entity0 said : ‘ the conflict has , for many , been seen through the fictional prism of dramas such as @entity29 , @entity30 and @entity3 as misbegotten shambles – a series of catastrophic mistakes perpetrated by an out of touch elite			1
even to this day there are left - wing academics all too happy to feed those myths			1
’ he said this portrayal served to belittle @entity39 ’s role in what was a ‘ just war ’ to combat @entity42 aggression			0
the troops who fought and died showed ‘ patriotism , honour and courage ’ , he said			0
but yesterday @entity48 ’s education spokesman , @entity47 , a historian , called mr @entity0 ’s article ‘ shocking stuff ’			2
and sir @entity8 , a prominent member of the @entity48 who once sat on its national executive , said : ‘ i think mr @entity0 has just made a very silly mistake			1
it is not that @entity3 teaches children about @entity12			2
when imaginative teachers bring it in , it ’s simply another teaching tool			0
‘ they probably take them over to @entity61 to have a look at the sights out there , have them marching around the playground , read the poems of @entity68 to them			0
and one of the things that they ’ll do is show them @entity3			2
’ he told @entity73 : ‘ to make this mistake , to categorise teachers who would introduce something like @entity3 as left - wing and introducing left - wing propaganda , is particularly unhelpful and irresponsible from a minister of education			1
it ’s just another example of slagging off teachers			0
’ a spokesman for mr @entity0 hit back , saying : ‘ @entity8 is wrong			1
@entity0 was n’t attacking teachers , he was attacking the myths perpetuated in @entity3 and elsewhere			1
‘ @entity0 thinks it is important not to denigrate the patriotism , honour and courage demonstrated by ordinary @entity39 soldiers in the @entity12			2
’ @entity88 is set in the trenches of the @entity90 in 1917 , and focuses on the increasingly desperate attempts of captain @entity3 , played by @entity92 , to avoid the action			2
speaking ahead of the centenary of the outbreak of the @entity12 mr @entity0 said only ' undergraduate cynics ' would say soldiers had fought in vain he receives little help from his sidekick @entity101			0
in his article mr @entity0 , who has been defended by some historians , said the effect of such programmes is that ‘ our understanding of the war has been overlaid by misunderstandings and misrepresentations which reflect an at best ambiguous attitude to this country and at worst an unhappy compulsion on the part of some to denigrate virtues such as patriotism , honour and courage ’			0
@entity39 is preparing to commemorate the centenary of the outbreak of the war in a series of events costing £ 50million			0
@entity48 ’s mr @entity47 claimed in @entity122 that the @entity123 was using the centenary to ‘ rewrite the historical record and sow political division ’ and accused the @entity127 of being ‘ crass ’			0
he added : ‘ whether you agree or disagree , after the deaths of 15million people during the war , attempting to position 1918 as a simplistic , nationalistic triumph seems equally foolhardy – not least because the very same tensions re-emerged to such deadly effect in 1939			0

@entity0 claimed @entity3 depicted *military* efforts as ' misbegotten shambles '
but sir @entity8 said he refused to accept @entity0 *'s* claims it fed ' left - wing myths '
he said it was ' unhelpful and irresponsible from a minister of education '
