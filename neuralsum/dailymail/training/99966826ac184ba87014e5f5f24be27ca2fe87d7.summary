by @entity0 published : 07:28 est , 4 october 2013 updated : 12:49 est , 4 october 2013 @entity1 as @entity2 in @entity3 , working the leopard print and giant earring look onesies , leopard print , ugg boots , oversized sunglasses and enormous earrings are the fashion fads and styles men hate on women			1
men voted overwhelmingly in favour of the natural look , putting cheap hair extensions , cheek piercings , heavy make - up and dip - dyed hair in the turn - off pile			1
they also said no - no to jumpsuits , clumpy boots with little dresses , ' hooker heels ' , chipped nail varnish and having g - strings on display			0
and when it came to looks the girls do n't like on the boys , low - hanging or salmon pink jeans , baseball caps balancing on the back of the head , fake tans and girly scarves were all greeted with a grimace			1
in terms of fashion idols , women would most like their men to dress like @entity44 or @entity45 , with @entity46 , @entity47 and @entity48 also making the top ten			1
meanwhile , men favoured the styles of @entity52 and the @entity53 , with @entity54 and @entity55 proving popular			1
the study of 1,000 men and 1,000 women also highlighted how women are far more likely to judge the opposite sex by the clothes they have on : 64 per cent of women make judgements compared to 48 per cent of men			1
women are also less likely to accept a date if the suitor is badly dressed : only 47 per cent would accept a date with someone who has bad fashion sense compared to 55 per cent of men			1
however , men are marginally more likely to let fashion get in the way of a good relationship , as 11 per cent have broken up with a girl because they could n’t stand the way she dressed , compared to nine per cent of women			1
@entity81 @entity80 in leopard print and ' hooker heels ' , left , and model @entity84 in a onesie , right @entity87 is well - known for her fondness for leopard print but this might be because women are more likely to try and change the way a partner dresses by shopping for them , and gradually redesigning their wardrobe			2
nearly half of women polled have tried to ' educate ' their boyfriend in the fashion stakes by advising him on his appearance			2
men and women agreed that when it comes to who has more style women have better knowledge and understanding of what makes a ' good look '			2
and men are more likely to get it wrong when making decisions about their outfit			2

' men in a beautifully cut suit are bound to make a good impression - @entity174 epitomises chic style and @entity46 style is current and modern and clearly adored by millions of women			2
men said they preferred women to dress in the conservative style of the @entity53 , left , or like tv presenter @entity52 , right ' no , no ’s would be three quarter - length trousers on men , it ’s a style that will never work			1
equally tracksuits with brand names scrawled across them are a heinous crime against fashion			0
