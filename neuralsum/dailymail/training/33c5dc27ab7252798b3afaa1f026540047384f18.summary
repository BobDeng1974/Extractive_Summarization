it could mean the end of the tv remote - and even the computer keyboard			0
@entity4 has been granted a patent for ' minority report ' - style 3d gesture controls			1
the system uses a 3d camera to track movement , and use it to control an on screen interface - which could be a computer or the much anticipated @entity12			2
@entity4 's @entity13 8933876 relates to ' three dimensional user interface session control ' - and in this image , the system is being used with a computer to control an on screen interface			1
@entity19 in minority report , which predicted gesture control systems it was announced late last year that @entity4 bought @entity24 company @entity23 , which developed @entity27 's @entity26 sensor , for around $ 350 million dollars a representative for @entity29 confirmed the deal at the time , but so far @entity4 has only said : ' @entity4 buys smaller technology companies from time to time , and we generally do not discuss our purpose or plans			1
' although @entity4 has n't announced what they 'll be using motion - sensor technology for , industry insiders have already begin throwing around ideas - including a rumored @entity4 manufactured television , the latest @entity41 patent no. 8933876 relates to ' three dimensional user interface session control			1
' the diagrams included in the patent show the technology being used to control a desktop computer			2
but it could also be applied to @entity12 , or to @entity4 's @entity49 devices			2
it also details how users would interact			0
for example , in a scenario invoking a soft bar ( shown in the illustration above as a system dock ) , a user raises their hand to unlock and activate motion tracking			2
in 2013 , the @entity61 company bought the @entity24 startup @entity23 for a reported £ 360 million — one of its largest acquisitions at the time			0
@entity23 had previously helped @entity27 develop its motion - sensing @entity26 technology			0
if the user drops their hand out of the sensing hardware 's field of view , the session is likewise dropped , with the example soft bar falling offscreen			0
the patent suggests users could unlock their @entity76 by ' swiping ' upward in the air			1
in 2013 @entity4 was also granted a patent for a 3d camera			1
the patent details a system capable of capturing low - resolution images that can be refocused even after they ’ve been taken and processed			0
a 3d camera - which @entity4 has also patented - tracks a user 's hand the patent application also reveals the same system being used to control a tv - perhaps the much anticipated @entity12 ? it would do this by capturing the whole light field of an image , similar to the technology seen in @entity95 cameras , meaning the shots appear in @entity97 rather than @entity98			1
according to patent papers , which were originally filed in 2011 , photographers could take an image and change the main area of focus numerous times to produce different shots			0
these images would be taken through what ’s called a microlens array			0
according to @entity4 's patent , this array would be detachable and could be removed when the user wanted to take a traditional high - resolution photo			1
a similar array is already used in @entity95 ’s @entity113 .			0

patent shows system that could control a tv , @entity76 , or even an @entity117
users can unlock their @entity76 by simply swiping up
comes as @entity4 *believed* to still be developing a tv set
