by @entity0 published : 20:22 est , 27 january 2013 updated : 20:23 est , 27 january 2013 plans for secret courts to be voted on by @entity4 today will undermine centuries of open justice and erode @entity8 ’s moral standing in the world , according to a hard - hitting new report			1
a paper by senior @entity14 mp @entity15 - a campaigner on human rights - and leading @entity19 @entity18 , calls on the government to rewrite its plans to hold court cases covering national security behind closed doors			1
cabinet minister @entity24 has watered down the controversial @entity25 following a series of humiliating defeats in the @entity28			2
a paper by @entity14 mp @entity15 ( pictured ) - a campaigner on human rights - and leading @entity19 @entity18 , calls on the government to rewrite its plans to hold court cases covering national security behind closed doors but ministers are still facing a rebellion despite attempts to buy off @entity40 mps opposed to secret justice			1
and today mr @entity15 publishes a report for the @entity43 think tank branding the plans ‘ neither just nor secure ’ and arguing that they need to be ‘ substantially rewritten ’			1
he said plans to hold civil court hearings on whether @entity8 spies colluded in torture will lead to a cover up of the dark side of the war on terror			1
‘ the government must make major changes to the @entity25 or risk prejudicing both @entity8 ’s system of open justice and our moral standing in the world , ’ the report says			1
the @entity62 has led criticism of plans to allow secret courts , under which civil cases would be conducted entirely in private			1
ministers claim they need to hold some cases behind closed doors so that judges can hear evidence on intelligence matters			2
the government has paid millions of pounds to terror suspects who accuse it of complicity in torture and rendition , after ministers said it was impossible to defend such claims without releasing secret material			1
but under the plans for ‘ closed material proceedings ’ defendants or claimants will not allowed to be present , know or challenge the case against them and must be represented by a security - cleared advocate , rather than their own lawyer			1
the new report says : ‘ that @entity8 allowed itself to be dragged into complicity in extraordinary rendition - the kidnap and torture of individuals as a matter of policy - is a disgrace			0
' that , nearly a decade later , the extent and limits of @entity8 ’s involvement are still unknown is almost as shocking			0
open : the @entity62 has led criticism of @entity73 plans to allow civil hearings to be conducted in private ‘ far from bolstering that confidence , the @entity25 ... would weaken it			2
' the effect of the government ’s proposals would make it more difficult to establish the truth about @entity8 ’s complicity in kidnap and torture			2
the @entity117 would provide a route neither more just nor more secure			0
’ the report calls for new rules which would mean summaries of the national security sensitive information be provided to the excluded party and his or her legal representatives			2
it demands a five year sunset clause , which would force @entity129 to reconsider how the secret courts are operating in the next @entity129			0
the report warns that @entity4 must also stand firm to oppose the removal of the courts ’ power to hear applications which seek the disclosure of information held by @entity8 authorities , in cases deemed to be “ sensitive ”			0
this was the principle used by detainee @entity142 ’s lawyers when he was contesting charges that could have resulted in the death penalty			0
‘ removing it will make it harder to uncover official wrongdoing in matters such as extraordinary rendition , ’ the report argues			0
and mr @entity15 also argues that @entity129 ’s @entity151 be given far more powers to hold the security services to account			1
at present it reports to the prime minister and was widely derided for failing to get to grips with @entity158 and @entity160 ’s knowledge of rendition			0
he said : ‘ the title of the @entity117 is classic doublespeak ; it brings us neither more justice nor greater security			0
to agree only to the amendments suggested by the @entity28 is not going far enough , as the @entity28 simply did not have the time to put all their concerns over this @entity117 in the form of amendments			0
’ a government source said mr @entity24 had bowed to concerns raised by the @entity28 and by @entity129 ’s @entity174 ( @entity175 )			2
the source said : ‘ the @entity117 is being substantially rewritten to accommodate the @entity40 and clauses have been rewritten to achieve what the @entity175 wanted			0
