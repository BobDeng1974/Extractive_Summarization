a grieving mother whose 15 - year - old daughter died after taking an ' exceptionally pure ' dose of @entity3 has called for the drug to be legalised so users can make an ' informed decision ' about what they are taking			1
teenager @entity11 , from the @entity9 area of @entity10 , suffered a cardiac arrest in july last year after unknowingly taking a 91 per cent pure dose of @entity3 - almost double the average street purity			1
now the teenager 's mother @entity15 is calling for @entity3 to be legalised so those wanting to ' dabble ' in getting high can be assured the drug is coming from a trustworthy source			1
speaking after the inquest into her daughter 's death , miss @entity15 said : ' we need strict and responsible regulation			1
' i 'm not a radical person , this has been well considered and thought out			2
if we had that , @entity20 would have been able to make an informed decision			2
' @entity20 wanted to get high , she did n't want to die - no parent wants either , but one of those is preferable to the other			1
' @entity20 was studying for her gcses when she collapsed in a park on july 20 , hours after taking 0.5mg of the drug			1
the gcse student died from a cardiac arrest after taking 0.5mg of the 91 per cent pure drug she died just hours afterwards at the @entity46 in @entity10			1
at the inquest into her death , the coroner warned other teenagers of the risks of taking drugs , explaining there was ' no way of knowing ' how pure they were			1
during that hearing , it emerged the drug taken was 91 per cent pure , compared to the average street purity of 58 per cent			1
miss @entity15 said control of drugs needed to be handed over to ' doctors and pharmacists , not drug dealers ' , to ensure what happened to her daughter did not happen again			1
she said : ' what is in place now resulted in what happened to me			2
@entity70 is outdated and it 's not realistic in modern society			0
' strict and responsible regulation is not the soft approach , it 's the hard approach			1
it 's taking some control			1
' no parent wants their child to take drugs but it would be reassuring to parents to know if they 're going to dabble they can get it from a trustworthy source			0
i think it 's highly inadequate what 's in place			0
' miss @entity15 is also calling for politicians to improve education about drugs and reform @entity95 policy by disclosing their contents			1
she said : ' i wish @entity20 was sitting her gcses alongside her friends at school right now			0
‘ i wish the drug education she received had enabled her to make a more fully informed decision , instead of leaving her so vulnerable and in danger			2
’ miss @entity15 said she was seeking a meeting with senior politicians , including home secretary @entity105 and @entity107 minister @entity106 , to discuss the eventual legalisation and regulation of recreational drugs			2
she said : ' it has been 328 days since my precious girl was safely by my side			0
miss @entity15 , who wants to meet with the home secretary over her plans , said ' strict and responsible regulation ' was needed so those who dabble in drug - taking could be assured the drug was coming from a trustworthy source ' i wish @entity20 was sitting her gcses alongside her friends at school right now			1
' i wish the drug education she received had enabled her to make a more fully - informed decision , instead of leaving her so vulnerable and in danger			1
' @entity20 wanted to get high , she did n't want to die			0
no parent wants either , but one of those is preferable to the other ' @entity15 - @entity15 ' i would like to meet with @entity105 , @entity106 and @entity128 to start a sensible dialogue for change , from prohibition to strict and responsible regulation of recreational drugs			1
' this will help to safeguard our children and lead to a safer society for us all by putting doctors and pharmacists , not dealers , in control of drugs			0
' @entity144 coroner @entity143 recorded a conclusion of accidental death at the inquest at @entity148 in @entity10			1
he said : ' it is a terrible loss and i think we can only say that it may at least serve as a warning to young people who may take , or think of taking , ecstasy or @entity3			2
' what is clear is that there is no way of knowing what it is made up of or what the purity level is			2
so , as i say , this is a very stark warning of what can happen			0
' the teenage drug dealer who sold the ecstacy that killed the teenager was spared prison last month			2
miss @entity15 said @entity20 , pictured above , ' wanted to get high , she did n't want to die ' when she took the drug tributes : mourners lay floral tributes at the scene in @entity173 , @entity10 , where @entity20 died last july @entity174 , 17 , sold an ' exceptionally ' pure version of the drug to a friend of @entity11			1
@entity174 pleaded guilty to supplying ecstasy , but instead of the ten - year jail term he might have received , he was given a three - month curfew and an 18 - month youth rehabilitation order			2
at that trial , prosecutor @entity182 said @entity20 had used the drug before			2
he said : ' @entity20 was saying the drugs were amazing , " it feels like a dream , it 's better than the last time that we did it "			0
' her friends then noticed that @entity20 was sweating a lot			0
she said she was going for a swim in a pond to cool down			0
change : miss @entity15 said doctors and pharmacists should be put in control of drugs , not dealers ' at that point , @entity20 collapsed , ' said mr @entity182			0
' her legs went from underneath her			0
' shortly after arriving at hospital @entity20 died after suffering a cardiac arrest			1
miss @entity15 described @entity20 as a ' bright and funny ' kid , telling how she used to walk her three - legged rabbit on a lead in @entity9 , @entity10			1
she added : " six weeks before she died she was predicted an f in @entity207			0
i got her a tutor and after she died i collected her gcse result and she got an @entity210 she was naturally bright			2
" i 'm just glad that although she had a short life it was a very full life			0
" ‘ @entity20 was a really bright kid			0
she had an engineer ’s brain and could do anything when she set her mind to it			0
she was an inch taller than me when she died			0
and i guess that ’s the point			0
she was nearly an adult			0
but she died just a few months short of her sixteenth birthday			0
