a leading member of the @entity2 protest movement has made an impassioned plea to the @entity4 deciding whether to indict the white officer who shot dead a black teenager			1
@entity7 said that his message to the panel is : ' a mother has lost her son and it is not of his own doing			1
' for people to continually to say it 's his fault for his death is just disgusting			2
' you have in your hands the decision to put someone away who has murdered a young man			2
' in an interview with @entity24 , fellows also revealed that the protesters feared that the police response to unrest when the @entity4 make their decision could be ' 10 times worse ' than before - because they had been preparing for so long			1
a grand jury is deciding whether to indict him fellows , 29 , has become a leading voice in the protest movement and has built up 5,000 followers on his @entity45 account through his work with the organizers			2
they began work right after @entity35 , 18 , was shot dead by @entity36 , 28 , a white police officer with the force in @entity2 , a suburb of @entity52 in @entity37 , on august 9			1
the killing sparked several nights of violent protest which was met with a military style response that sparked a debate about the use of force by police and race relations in @entity62			1
since then protesters have been working under coalitions such as @entity65 and in october staged a ' @entity66 '			0
they have also made extensive use of social media , appeared on major tv networks , set up training sessions for protesters and have won pledges of support from around the world			0
with the @entity4 decision expected in the coming days , @entity37 governor @entity75 has declared a state of emergency in @entity52 and the surrounding counties with 400 troops expected to be deployed in the downtown area of the city			2
fellows said : ' with governor @entity75 declaring a state of emergency for @entity52 that 's basically just the unwritten rule that whatever the police feel , if they feel threatened or feel the need to act in a certain way , they have the freedom to do so			1
' so it 's no - holds barred on our constitutional rules and our rights as citizens			1
that 's out the door for now			2
' going into that mentally , we can prepare as much as we think we can but what are we preparing for ? with us going through august , we think it 's going to be 10 times worse			1
it 's so hilarious for me how people focus and violence and it 's coming from police , not protesters			1
' fellows told @entity24 that an indictment was the ' only way ' the @entity4 , which has nine white members and three black , should vote			0
he said : ' they have that power to decide should he be reprimanded ... it 's not fair ' flashpoint : @entity2 is expecting more demonstrations when the grand jury ends it deliberations tensions : demonstrations are already taking place in @entity2 , @entity37 , with calls for @entity36 to be indicted by the grand jury , which meets again on friday , over the killing of @entity35 divide : although most demonstrations have been @entity126 some , such as this woman 's protest , have been in support of @entity36 , the officer who shot @entity35 to death fellows said that he has heard many rumors about @entity36 : that he went to a @entity135 ice hockey game , that he had dyed his hair and that he had changed his name			1
some people were even joking that he was in @entity139 or the @entity140			0
fellows said : ' i think he 's in @entity52			2
look how much money people have raised for him			0
he does n't have to leave			0
' nobody 's protected @entity146 's ( @entity35 ) family			1
i could n't be in the same room as him ( @entity36 )			0
i 'm not even an angry person or a violent person			0
i ca n't sit and look at you in the face			0
' if you are a human being , you have a heart and you have any common sense , turn yourself in			0
' why are you letting it go on like this ? i have no respect for him			0
it 's as simple as that			2
go to the @entity160 and turn yourself in ' it has now been three months since @entity35 was shot dead and the protesters are ' exhausted ' , @entity7 said			1
he had been working as a biller for a healthcare company but lost his job as he found it impossible to juggle employment and protesting			0
fellows said that he can not pay his bills and that the rent on his apartment was overdue - and others like him are in the same boat			2
he said : ' it 's definitely a huge sacrifice			0
i have a lot of friends who have kids and they ca n't come out ( and protest ) for that very reason			0
' that 's why i 'm doing this , so that their kids can walk out on the street and not be approached by a cop asking them where they 're going			0
' that 's why i 'm doing this			0
' fellows told @entity24 that he was ' skeptical ' about the @entity191 which was announced on tuesday by @entity37 governor @entity75 to look into the causes of the divisions in the city			0
however he said had ' absolute faith ' in four members who he knew personally , including the youngest , 20 - year - old @entity198			0
exclusive : @entity200 demonstrators face claims of @entity203 infiltration after ' imperial wizard ' apparently spotted by anti-police demonstrators @entity2 , @entity37 for @entity24 @entity203 members may have infiltrated groups supporting @entity2 police officer @entity36 , it can be disclosed			1
supporters for @entity36 have removed a photograph from their @entity212 page in which activist group @entity213 claim to identify three members of the @entity203			1
@entity213 seized two of the @entity203 's twitter accounts yesterday after the @entity203 distributed fliers threatening the use of ' lethal force ' should violence erupt in the wake of @entity223 's decision on whether to indict @entity36			1
now , as part of @entity226 , the group has circulated numerous photographs ' unhooding ' klan members			0
among them is one showing 13 members of the @entity232			0
it is set shown alongside an image of a rally held in support of @entity36 rally in which , they claim , three @entity203 members feature prominently			1
one of them appears to be @entity240 , @entity241 of the @entity242 in @entity37 and the man behind the recent fliers			0
accusation : how activist group anonymous identified what it says are three @entity203 members ( left in robes ) at a @entity249 protest ( right )			1
there is no suggestion than any @entity203 presence was known to organisers out in the open : the full picture of the @entity203 group posted by the @entity213			1
it is just the latest escalation of the racial tensions that were ignited this summer when officer @entity36 shot dead unarmed teenager @entity35 , 18			1
protesters adopted the slogan ' @entity264 do n't shoot ' - a reference to witness accounts claiming that @entity35 had his hands up when @entity36 let off his fatal volley on august 9			1
less than two minutes elapsed between @entity36 , 28 , stopping @entity35 and friend , @entity270 , as they walked down the middle of @entity273 which snakes down from the main drag of @entity275 , and shooting @entity35 dead			1
in the three months since that day @entity2 has been riven by violence , protest , gunfire and looting			2
@entity35 's own parents have consistently distanced themselves from the violence that saw protesters and police clash as battle lines were drawn near the scene of the shooting across night after night of riots			1
but , with the @entity223 expected to deliver its verdict on whether or not to indict @entity36 on a murder charge this week , the @entity288 have described violent civil unrest as ' inevitable			2
' governor @entity75 's decision to declare a state of emergency and activated the @entity295 on monday was seen by many as confirmation that a decision from the @entity4 is imminent			2
and prosecutor @entity299 has always maintained that a verdict would be reached by mid to late november			0
but leaks reported by the @entity302 , which suggest that the officer will not be indicted , have only heightened the likelihood of violent reprisal			0
as @entity24 reported , ' militant resistance group ' the @entity306 has boasted of being ' war ready , ' and stockpiling high caliber ammunition			0
while the @entity203 leaflets distributed in @entity2 and the surrounding towns suggest a similar readiness for violence .			1

@entity7 says panel has duty towards @entity35 's family to charge officer with first - degree murder
protest leader believes police have had so long to prepare for decision that response will be ' ten times worse ' than summer
decision could come as early as *tomorrow* and law **enforcement** are on high alert for violence
tensions high in town amid claims of @entity203 infiltration of *pro-police* protests and massive law **enforcement** presence
