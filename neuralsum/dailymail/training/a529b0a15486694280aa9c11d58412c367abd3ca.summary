@entity0 will be handed a remarkable reprieve when he is named on thursday as a @entity3 race driver for 2015			1
the 34 - year - old @entity4 had given up all hope of taking his @entity7 career into a 16th season as @entity3 bosses wanted to plump for their @entity11 rookie @entity10 to partner the incoming @entity12			1
but that decision was never rubber - stamped , and weeks of uncertainty began			0
2009 world champion @entity0 has been retained by @entity3 for the 2015 season two - time world champion @entity12 will re-join @entity3 from @entity17 having left in 2007 @entity10 faces uncertain future after missing out on @entity3 seat in 2015 now @entity20 has learned from an impeccably - placed source within @entity3 that @entity0 has been offered a new contract and will be unveiled , along with @entity12 , at @entity3 ’s base in @entity24			1
@entity0 ’s good news means that @entity3 ’s new partnership with @entity27 will start in dazzling style : with two drivers who have three world titles between them			1
@entity31 will be kept on , in one form or another , remains to be seen			0
it seems likely that the move to keep @entity0 came about after @entity3 chairman @entity36 took into account the wishes of his shareholders and @entity27 , who established a good relationship with @entity0 when he drove for them from 2003 to 2008			1
@entity0 took to @entity42 to reveal his happiness at staying on with @entity3 for the 2015 season the 34 - year - old also welcomed new team - mate @entity12 to @entity3 following his switch from @entity17 in a succession of tweets @entity0 showed his support for @entity10 - stating he 'll be back racing in the sport for a long time @entity36 had shown no inclination to re-sign @entity0			1
indeed , both he and racing director @entity52 privately indicated that they favoured the blend of experience and youth offered by @entity10 , 22 , and @entity12 , 33			2
that @entity0 outscored @entity10 126 points to 55 last season seemed not to be enough			2
@entity0 grew so frustrated with his treatment that before the penultimate race in @entity61 he wondered aloud if he would even accept a new contract if one was forthcoming			2
‘ that ’s a good question , ’ he said			0
he also drew up plans to take part in the @entity67			0
but the pendulum gradually swung his way as a series of deadlines were missed			0
first , @entity3 said their driver line - up would be announced before the season - closing @entity73			1
they then deferred it until no earlier than december 1			0
@entity0 won the world title with @entity76 back in 2009 and has been at @entity3 since 2010 @entity36 ’s slow deliberations frustrated a number of his staff , as well as fans who complained on the internet			1
even when he discussed the team ’s driver line - up at a board meeting last week , there was still no decision			2
a power struggle at the top between @entity36 and his fellow shareholder @entity89 , the @entity90 entrepreneur , may have been one reason for the impasse			0
@entity0 said all along that he did not want to stay for the sake of money			2
he is already ranked @entity96 ’s second - richest sportsman behind @entity97 in the @entity98 with £ 63m			0
@entity20 has been told he settled for a heavily reduced salary to accommodate the £ 25m a year that @entity12 will be paid on his return from @entity17 to the team where he spent a turbulent season in 2007			0

@entity3 to announce their 2015 line - up in press *conference* on thursday
@entity0 will partner two - time world champion @entity12
@entity110 helped by support from shareholders and *engine* *makers* @entity27
