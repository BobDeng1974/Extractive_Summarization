@entity0 will be a better champion for the image of @entity2 than his title rival @entity3 , according to @entity4			1
@entity0 is 24 points ahead of his @entity7 team - mate with two races , the @entity10 @entity9 later on sunday , and the season finale in @entity12 in a fortnight ’s time , remaining			1
@entity4 , interviewed alongside @entity0 , claimed that he was ‘ sure ’ @entity3 would win this year ’s championship at the start of the season , but now feels a triumph for @entity0 would be more beneficial for the sport			1
@entity20 driver @entity0 poses for a selfie with a fan ahead of sunday 's @entity10 @entity9 @entity0 starts behind pole - sitter and @entity7 team - mate @entity3 at sunday afternoon 's race in @entity10 ‘ at the beginning of the year , i thought @entity3 would be champion , ’ said @entity4			1
‘ i thought that would probably suit the team better			0
and in my position i thought it would be better for @entity2 to have a world champion who can speak several languages			1
‘ i thought that if there was going to be any help , which i am certain that there has n’t been , then maybe there would be a bit more support forthcoming from a @entity40 team for a @entity40 driver			0
so yes , i was sure that @entity3 would do it			2
‘ privately i thought that @entity0 would be a good champion			2
he is more widely known around the world than @entity3			0
consequently , he would be the better champion for the sport			0
‘ i ’m sure that , for example , 80 per cent of the people in @entity47 know @entity0 , and it ’s probably the same for the rest of the world			2
most people have n’t heard of @entity3			1
therefore , @entity0 would be the better champion as far as this sport is concerned			2
’ @entity0 , in action during saturday 's qualifying session , is 24 points ahead of his team - mate with two races left @entity4 , in the @entity60 paddock , reckons @entity0 will be a better champion for the sport than @entity3 under last year ’s rules , a tenth - place finish at today 's @entity10 @entity9 would have been enough for @entity0 to secure his second title			1
yet bizarrely , the @entity65 who starts the @entity60 race in second place behind @entity3 , could win today and still miss out on the championship under the new double points ruling			1
‘ around here , what he [ @entity4 ] says goes , ’ @entity0 said in a candid interview on the official @entity2 website			1
‘ he ’s the boss			0
he wanted double points for last race of the season and here you go : he ’s got it			0
’ @entity4 interjected : ‘ i wanted it for the last three races			0
that ’s what i wanted			0
i never thought that it would come to this sort of situation			0
‘ i thought that @entity3 would be disappearing in the standings and maybe @entity0 would be trying to catch up			1
‘ @entity0 would get his act together and by @entity88 he ’d look as if he had a chance because despite being a long way behind , by winning the next three or four races he could catch up - and with the last three races on double points it could have worked			2
at least that was the plan			0
it did n’t work out that way			0

@entity4 reckons the sport will benefit from @entity0 's global appeal
the @entity2 *supremo* claimed most people ' have *n't* heard ' of @entity3
but he *admitted* he thought @entity3 would win the title ahead of the season
@entity0 leads @entity3 by 24 points with only two grands prix remaining
