the older sister , who wore a black balaclava and brightly - patterned leggings with a dark crop top told @entity151 : ' i felt it was an advantage because me and my sister wanted to be judged purely on our twerk skills , not our looks			2
' if our faces are covered they have to look at our a * * * * only			0
' we combined balaclavas with crop tops and patterned leggings			0
' you have to showcase more effort to see the jiggle through the fabric — so that 's why we do n't wear shorts			0
' a ' jelly round ' saw the girls standing still and shaking without moving their feet			0
the event had an 18 age limit and the pumped - up crowd went crazy during the grand finale round where the girls twerked upside - down while being held up by a male audience member			2
event organiser , @entity178 , from @entity179 , told @entity55 the event was sold out very quickly and he hopes the competition will become an annual event			1
' the crowd had an incredible time			0
they never stopped making noise and we 're getting requests about when the next event is			0
we are most definitely looking to make this an annual event and currently working on a @entity9 tour to showcase the winners			1
' although twerking is currently in the media spotlight mr @entity178 denied it was a recent phenomenon			0
he said : ' @entity195 shaking or what its now more commonly known as twerking has been part of hip hip culture for decades and is only getting the media spotlight because of @entity1 ' attempts to try to twerk			0
' @entity43 is the now famous dance performed by @entity1 at the @entity45 in the summer the term ' twerk ' was added to the @entity50 recently			1
@entity205 , from @entity50 , said ' twerk ' was around 20 years old and seemed to have been coined as part of the ' bounce ' hip - hop scene in the @entity2			1
' by last year , it had generated enough currency to be added to our new words watch list , and by this spring , we had enough evidence of usage frequency in a breadth of sources to consider adding it to our dictionaries of current @entity220 , ' she said			2
' there are many theories about the origin of this word , and since it arose in oral use , we may never know the answer for sure			0
' we think the most likely theory is that it is an alteration of work , because that word has a history of being used in similar ways , with dancers being encouraged to " work it "			0
the " t " could be a result of blending with another word such as twist or twitch			0
' the current public reaction to twerking is reminiscent in some ways of how the twisting craze was regarded in the early 1960s , when it was first popularised by @entity245 ’s song , the twist			0
' only time will tell if twerking will similarly be embraced by the general public			0
