if @entity0 votes ‘ yes ’ on thursday @entity1 will go down in history as the man who led his country to independence – or needlessly tore apart the world ’s most successful union after 300 years			0
but mr @entity1 will not have achieved the @entity9 nationalists ’ dream alone			0
throughout his political life the @entity12 ’s great hope has surrounded himself with a close - knit team of advisers which have run the party with ruthless efficiency			1
the spinners , backroom deal makers and millionaire backers have sacrificed everything for ‘ the @entity22 ’ - propelling @entity9 to the brink of independence			1
but mr @entity1 also relies on the @entity12 chief executive @entity30 – husband of @entity9 ’s deputy first minister @entity29			1
together the four party chieftains have guided the party from multiple election defeats to the brink of breaking up the @entity44			0
the @entity12 's success was built on picking a team of backroom supporters united by two goals : winning elections and taking @entity9 out of the @entity50			1
this is the backroom army which really runs the @entity12			1
at the heart of the operation is mr @entity26			2
now in his forties , he joined the party in 1989 and swiftly rose to a position where he was the first minister 's most trusted lieutenant			1
born in @entity59 , the son of a milkman and an auxiliary nurse , he started worrying about nuclear weapons at the age of 11 , joined the @entity12 at the age of 18 and began working for the party as a researcher at 21 as soon as he graduated from @entity68			1
he became director of communications in the decade that followed , leading up to the creation of the @entity9 parliament			0
in 1998 , a year after @entity9 voted in the devolution referendum , @entity74 said mr @entity26 was the @entity12 's ‘ biggest asset '			1
when mr @entity1 stood down from @entity77 in 2000 to lead the @entity12 group in the @entity79 , leaving @entity80 to hold the reins in @entity82 , mr @entity26 followed him to @entity83			1
@entity84 ( left ) and his wife @entity86 pose for pictures with champagne during a photocall in @entity90 , @entity9 , after scooping the lottery in 2011 the @entity12 supporters won £ 161million and have donated £ 4.5million of their fortune to the campaign to break up the @entity50 @entity95 a senior policy adviser who wrote the @entity12 's 2011 manifesto and is now chief strategist at @entity0			1
a @entity100 - educated former @entity99 , he was spotted by mr @entity1 after he and two fellow @entity102 students draped the @entity103 over the railings in front of the @entity106 at @entity107			0
he later made the headlines when he claimed he was sacked as press secretary to the head of the @entity111 in @entity112 for being gay			0
@entity114 the former tv journalist has been with the party since 1999 before being appointed deputy first minister @entity29 's top adviser in 2007 - a position he keeps to this day			1
he is undoubtedly one of the most popular spin doctors in @entity77			0
@entity120 the spin doctor headed the @entity12 's communications team when mr @entity26 went to @entity83 , is now a special adviser			1
in the corridors of power in @entity77 he is seen as ‘ harder to like ’ than mr @entity114			0
@entity125 a skilled amateur footballer with @entity82 - based club @entity127 , was only 24 when he joined mr @entity1 's operation and became known in the parliament as the first minister 's ' bag carrier '			1
he had worked part - time in the @entity12 leader 's constituency office and was so dedicated to the cause of @entity135 that he turned down a job with the @entity137 to remain with the party			1
in the years since 2007 , mr @entity125 's role has increased massively and he now has the grand , @entity142 - style title of chief of staff			1
insiders say he is almost as powerful as mr @entity26 once was			2
@entity145 a former @entity9 political editor at the @entity9 @entity147 , who has drastically cut the amount of time advisers spend with the media			0
observers agree that he has become increasingly ' tetchy ' in recent months and the entire communications team often shows disdain for a printed press that has repeatedly exposed the shortcomings of the independence campaign			2
@entity157 a geordie who was once named one of @entity9 's most eligible women and is one of the loudest defenders of the economics behind independence			0
mr @entity26 stood for the @entity12 in @entity165 in the 2003 @entity77 election			1
he came third and was accused of ' anti-englishness ' after calling for the @entity169 's statue in @entity170 to be removed to make way for one of @entity173			0
after a brief stint in the communications department at @entity176 , mr @entity26 returned to take control of mr @entity1 's spin team in the 2007 @entity9 elections			1
mr @entity26 is now based in the party ’s tiny hq on @entity182 , a small alley between @entity82 's @entity184 and @entity185			1
this is the base for another passionate nationalist who had settled on a political career behind the scenes : mr @entity30 , who had once been mr @entity1 's constituency assistant			2
since 2001 , when he replaced @entity191 as chief executive , he has managed to make himself so invaluable that his remuneration package has soared from £ 35,000 to more than £ 100,000			0
few people claim to know him well			0
he is rarely seen , except at elections and at party conferences			0
at these carefully choreographed conferences , he is nearly always present in the main auditorium , usually standing in the shadows to the side of the stage			0
he whispers instructions to cabinet ministers as they prepare to make keynote speeches and is more powerful than anyone watching mr @entity1 's tub - thumping performances on the tv could possibly realise			2
only after @entity74 's speech , when he kisses his wife , does he appear in the spotlight			2
supporters credit him with creating one of @entity214 's most formidable election machines			0
but critics will never forgive him for ignoring warnings that one @entity12 candidate in 2011 , @entity217 , was a serial wifebeater			2
@entity217 was eventually sent to jail when his past caught up with him , while mr @entity30 survived calls for his resignation			0
the chief executive has worked closely with mr @entity26 over the years , and the pair were present at a crucial summit at the @entity225 on @entity226 in 2005			2
there they made a solemn vow ' to be ready for government before may 3 , 2007 , and in government thereafter			0
' but the @entity12 's operation is not a two - man team			1
mr @entity1 has also received crucial backing from long time @entity12 supporters @entity86 and @entity84 – who happened to win the lottery in 2011			1
the pair have bankrolled an astonishing 80 per cent of @entity0 ’s fight to break up @entity44 , donating £ 2.5million to the cause in just 12 months			0
it shows that the @entity243 couple , who won £ 161m in a @entity244 draw in 2011 , has donated a total of £ 4.5m to @entity12 and the @entity0 campaign since their win			2
it means almost 80 per cent of £ 4.9million funding for the separation campaign has come from just one source – something the grassroots campaign @entity254 warned was ‘ unhealthy ’			0
the @entity255 ’ latest £ 2.5million pledge to @entity0 is their second to the pro-independence campaign , having previously donated £ 1million			0
and the couple , who scooped @entity9 ’s biggest ever lottery jackpot , also gave £ 1million to the @entity12 , in 2011 .			2

first minister supported by team of spinners and backroom dealers
spin chief @entity26 is the @entity12 chief 's long - serving right hand man
party boss @entity30 and his wife @entity29 form @entity12 inner circle
lottery winners @entity86 and @entity84 have bankrolled the ' yes ' campaign
