@entity0 ponders the punditry style that has seen him consistently ruffle the feathers of the cricket establishment ever since he retired 30 years ago			1
‘ i ’ve never been a fence sitter , ’ he says with considerable under - statement			1
‘ it has got me into hot water at times over the years but i am always looking for an angle that will make people sit up and take notice			0
‘ it ’s easy to describe what has happened but the way i like to come at it is trying to get inside the way people are thinking			0
so much of international sport is played between the ears and if i ’m critical it ’s because i ’m questioning whether a particular player has the mental grit and strength to rise to the challenge			0
’ cricketing legend @entity0 spoke with @entity23 about his views on @entity26 international cricket @entity0 ( bottom left ) in action for @entity26 against the @entity29 at @entity30 in 1976 it is a method that has made @entity0 , at 65 , something of a cult figure of @entity35 ’s comprehensive cricket coverage in a niche role that perfectly suits his talents			1
he is one of the best fast bowlers @entity26 have ever produced but to a whole generation of younger fans he is instead @entity43 ’s outspoken sidekick on the verdict programmes that follow each day of international cricket			1
they have become a formidable partnership			2
@entity43 will set things up and @entity0 , taking a deep breath and invariably starting with the words ‘ @entity51 , ’ soon comes steaming in off his long run , knees metaphorically pumping in the inimitable style that earned him legendary status at @entity56 in 1981			1
‘ the verdict has captured people ’s imaginations , ’ says a man who has proved far more effective in the studio , fixing the viewer with a stare and providing thought - provoking analysis , than in his years in the commentary box			2
‘ it seems to have struck a cord with people and they can react to it			0
it used to be mostly highlights and then a rushed chat but now we have four people dissecting decisions and techniques in far more detail			0
nowadays the former @entity26 speed bowler is better known for his exploits in the commentary box ‘ we often have current players joining us and @entity51 will always try to eke out the odd dressing room secret while they will do their utmost not to give anything away			1
he usually gets something out of them			0
‘ i think it will be very popular during the @entity88 because not too many people can sit up all night to watch a whole game			2
and we will be in an all singing and dancing studio , complete with bells and whistles			0
’ the last line is delivered dead - pan but with a hint of a smile			2
@entity0 is a far more engaging man than many realise , with a dry sense of humour and a warm personality that does not always shine through on screen			1
but his trenchant , forward thinking , sometimes radical , views have long challenged those in power			0
‘ i ’ve always been a bit of a hot - head and i ’ve tried to revolutionise the game from time to time since i retired as a player , ’ says @entity0			1
‘ i never got very far sitting on committees because i was just too impatient			0
they would always want to set up a working party whereas i would want to try to get things done			0
@entity116 is captain of the @entity117 in the hugely successful @entity118 ‘ i do think there is something of a revolution around the corner , or at least an evolution			0
the success of the @entity118 and the @entity125 means that @entity26 will have to think very strongly again about franchises for @entity128 cricket			1
there is ongoing change at the @entity131 and the mood for progress will prove irresistible			2
we might well see an @entity135 before too long			0
’ it is something he would welcome			0
‘ @entity26 came up with @entity128 cricket but we have clearly fallen well behind , ’ says @entity0			1
‘ how well it has worked in @entity139 and @entity140 is clear for all to see but if we are to adopt something like that here then something will have to give			0
@entity0 also predicts something of an evolution in cricket following the success of the @entity125 with ongoing change in @entity139 and @entity140 cricket @entity0 believes the @entity151 game has fallen behind @entity152 in action for the @entity154 during a @entity125 match against the @entity156 ‘ we have county captains in @entity159 and @entity160 in our studio and we talk about how their teams have to play in three different formats of the game in the space of seven or eight days			1
it can seriously stifle the development of young players			0
i ’ve always been a fan of fewer but more meaningful championship matches with each game having a sense of occasion			2
’ it is the incredible rise of @entity128 cricket that @entity0 believes has had a dramatic effect on the 50 - over game and will define the @entity88 that begins in exactly a month ’s time in @entity140 and @entity176			1
‘ for a while @entity26 had a good run in one - day internationals and got to the top of the world rankings a couple of years ago with @entity180 and @entity181 to the fore but the game has moved on a pace since then , ’ he says			1
@entity0 believes @entity26 have failed to move on from their one - day international success ‘ @entity139 players are getting individual scores of 200 plus in one - day games now and there are light years between them and the way @entity26 play			1
‘ the limited - overs game has changed beyond all recognition			1
the adage used to be that you would get to 30 overs and then try to double your score in the last 20			0
but now , because of @entity128 , you must look to score at least a hundred in the last 10 overs and life is pretty tough for bowlers these days			2
‘ the old fogies in the commentary box will ask why are n’t more yorkers being bowled at the death but just look at what happens now if they get them fractionally wrong			0
they go out of the ground			0
’ conversely , @entity0 offers hope when asked about @entity26 ’s @entity88 prospects			1
‘ they will be rank outsiders but every cricket fan will be willing them to do well because of the fresh look about the squad and the new faces who are prepared to take risks			2
@entity26 will have to be fearless but it is an exciting squad in many ways and the key could be how the middle order reacts under pressure			1
according to @entity26 will be able to gain momentum under new captain @entity227 ( left ) ‘ i have sympathy for the selectors in many ways because clearly @entity231 , @entity232 and @entity233 believe @entity180 is the natural leader of this group and they gave him every chance but it got to the stage where they had to make a change			1
the ambience under @entity227 will be notably different			0
@entity26 ’s fortunes @entity241 will be dissected forensically by @entity0 , who has been with @entity35 virtually since their inception but remains as enthusiastic and passionate about @entity151 cricket as ever			1
‘ @entity35 have worked wonders with broadcasting this game , ’ he says			2
‘ you hear people talking about cricket on free to air television but i ’m not sure it ’ s realistic for terrestrial channels to cover everything from international to county , women ’s and @entity248 19 cricket			2
and we will have our own channel for the @entity88			0
i ’m obviously biased but i think @entity35 are incomparable			0
‘ i ’m not sure the younger generation know much about what @entity261 and @entity0 did now and i think we will soon be filed away alongside @entity263 in the dim and distant past			1
but i think i bring something fresh to the coverage and i ’ d like to do it for as long as i can			0
long may it continue ! ’ well @entity51 , @entity0 might be coming off his long run for some time yet .			1
