modern @entity0 comes as a shock to most @entity3 persons			2
the former @entity5 mp @entity4 was so appalled when he visited @entity6 that the resulting article was used in @entity9 propaganda in the by - election there			1
mr @entity4 appeared to be looking down a very long nose indeed at that town ’s people and their lives			2
it did n’t seem to cross his mind that he – as a politician , broadcaster and influential journalist – might have helped to make it like that			1
at first glance , @entity22 is not much like @entity6			1
it is an ancient cathedral city you might have glimpsed and wondered about as you took the @entity26 to @entity27 , or the @entity28 to @entity29 , and saw its @entity30 keep and ancient spire in the middle distance			2
its @entity34 is a glory of old - fashioned @entity36 , a chapter from @entity38 in brick , stone , timber and plaster			1
almost every enterprise is named after a @entity38 character			2
at this time of year , when the dusk begins to fall quite early , and the yellow lights come on behind the small panes of glass , it is so moving and evocative i almost stopped breathing at the sight of it			2
@entity53 : the town of @entity22 looks like something out of a @entity38 novel but then @entity38 and his books are real to me			1
the place must be as mysterious as @entity59 to most modern @entity61 people , for whom @entity38 is a firmly closed book			2
it is also , like so much of picturesque @entity0 , a museum where you can buy and eat the exhibits			2
while @entity22 is marinated in history and literature , @entity67 is just there , an unremarkable place where the @entity61 have lived in reasonable prosperity and freedom for centuries			1
it is possible @entity38 was thinking of @entity67 when he named his last , unfinished book @entity77 ( which rhymes with @entity67 )			1
but he actually set it in @entity22			1
it certainly has a past			2
its people must have seen the smoke and heard the guns in 1667 as the @entity86 fleet sailed up the @entity87 to nearby @entity88 and burned or seized the pride of the @entity90 , a national humiliation now almost completely forgotten , but once considered a grave warning to any @entity93 government which neglected the @entity90 , as @entity94 did then and we are doing now			2
cross the now - peaceful @entity87 to @entity67 and you are in the real world of fast food , cut - price supermarkets , charity shops , a pound store , amazing numbers of hairdressers ( does @entity93 have enough hair to go round all these establishments ? ) the usual riot of architecture - free concrete shops , anti-pedestrian fencing and wide , fast highways whose pelican crossings are so slow to change that you could easily forget why you wanted to cross the road in the first place			1
this is just standard semi-urban southern @entity0 , a few ghostly older buildings surviving amid the post- 1960s modernisation which turned so much of the country into a pallid and unsuccessful copy of the less appealing parts of the @entity122 , with a hint of @entity124 thrown in			2
in @entity22 , the @entity9 office had been full of optimism and busy - ness			1
people were coming up to @entity9 candidate @entity128 in the street to offer encouragement			0
but in @entity67 , despite the autumn sunlight , i found a curious angry apathy			1
a few weeks ago , in @entity135 , everyone i spoke to about the referendum had an articulate opinion on ‘ yes ’ or ‘ no ’			0
all planned to vote , none resented the process			1
campaigning : in @entity22 , the @entity9 office had been full of optimism and busy - ness			1
people were coming up to @entity9 candidate @entity128 in the street to offer encouragement in @entity67 , my wholly unreliable and unscientific sample was the polar opposite			1
they were a very @entity61 sample – not a @entity147 or a @entity148 to be seen			0
after a while i began to dread asking anyone his views , and to wonder if i was the victim of an elaborate trick , and they were all actors hired by @entity154 to confuse me			0
almost everyone i talked to in @entity67 ( i took up station close to @entity157 and not far from @entity158 ) was disillusioned to the point of cynicism			1
i ca n’t disapprove of this on principle			0
i am a hardened non-voter , and ca n’t remember when i last bothered to cast a ballot in the safe @entity165 seat where i dwell			0
but if i lived in @entity22 or @entity67 i should certainly vote next week , because it seems to me , on this rare occasion , it would make a difference			1
if the @entity171 ca n’t hold @entity22 , politics in this country will change deeply and forever			1
if they do hold it , politics in this country will remain the same			0
that ’s quite an incentive to vote – whatever way you feel			1
i ’m still amazed by the prime minister ’s direct appeal to @entity165 supporters to vote @entity5 , which they are as likely to do as they are likely to tandoori and eat their grannies			1
but in many cases , this is a crossroads that ordinary human beings are n’t even interested in visiting			0
people told me they were sick of immigration , sick of low wages , sick of false promises			0
i said that in that case @entity9 was their ideal party , but they said that no , it was n’t			0
they had heard of it			0
they knew what it was , but they did n’t trust it			0
some thought the whole election was a waste of money			2
others were just hopelessly confused , the most perplexed being an enthusiastic @entity205 supporter who suddenly launched into a diatribe of dislike against @entity208			0
unchanged : its @entity34 is a glory of old - fashioned @entity36 , a chapter from @entity38 in brick , stone , timber and plaster ; almost every enterprise is named after a @entity38 character it was a reminder that , for many people , politics is as baffling , distant , pointless and uninteresting as sport is to me			2
now , i respect opinion polls			0
they are generally right , provided you read them carefully and remember that they are a device for influencing opinion much more than a way of measuring it			0
and i respect the judgment of political professionals on the spot , whose unvarying view is that the @entity171 are not doing well in @entity22 and @entity67			1
so i expect @entity9 will win , not least because i personally will be glad if they do			0
i am amazed it has taken so long for ordinary @entity5 supporters to see through their party and particularly through @entity241 , an unusually transparent snake - oil salesman , even for these times			1
but the polls ca n’t really cope with the kind of people i talked to in @entity67			1
these are the great unmoved , the people who neither speak nor vote – the biggest political party in @entity93 , if anyone could mobilise them			2
i am surprised that they remain unstirred			0
if @entity9 win on thursday , it will be first because the @entity5 circle can not be squared			0
the @entity171 can not win new voters without driving away just as many old ones			0
and they can not shake off the hatred which clings to them from the @entity258 years			0
second , it will be because those who pinned false hopes on @entity258 in 1979 , and then pinned equally false hopes on @entity263 in 1997 , are turning once again to someone who looks and sounds as if he knows what to do about a country in deep trouble			0
if that is so , then next may ’s general election will mark the boundary between the long , settled @entity165 - @entity5 era and a new period of groping and uncertainty			1
political parties take a long time to die , and they can still kick and bite quite hard while they are expiring			0
@entity22 and @entity67 wo n’t mark the end of this long process , but it might well accelerate it quite sharply			1
i dare n’t go further than that			0
i have no great expectations			0
but as all readers of @entity38 know , such expectations can turn out to be deeply misleading , or worse .			0

those living in @entity22 and @entity284 urged to vote to make a difference
in @entity67 there was a ' curious and angry apathy ' ahead of the election
@entity241 is labelled a transparent snake - oil salesman
