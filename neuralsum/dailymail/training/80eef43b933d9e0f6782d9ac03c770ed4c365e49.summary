@entity1 will be the most ethnically mixed country in the western world in less than 40 years , experts predicted yesterday			1
they claimed that the share of the population from an ethnic minority or migrant background will hit 38 per cent – overtaking other nations – in around 2050			2
and the study said @entity1 will become the most mixed country in @entity10 in around five years when the minority and migrant proportion of the population overtakes the same group in the @entity16			1
a new study suggests @entity1 's ethnic make - up will be as diverse as the @entity19 by 2050 the analysis , prepared by professor @entity21 of @entity22 for the @entity24 think - tank , is a fresh indicator of the impact of large - scale migration on life in @entity1			1
professor @entity21 , an expert in demography , the study of how populations change , endorsed a projection he made two years ago suggesting that at current migration rates white @entity1 people will be a minority in the population by about 2066 , in just over 50 years			1
in his new paper , he said these projections may prove to be too high if the @entity40 keeps its pledge to reduce net migration – the difference between those arriving in the country and those people leaving			0
‘ the highest migration projections for the @entity1 put the crossover for the whole country , when the combined population of all ethnic minority groups together would exceed the population of white @entity1 , at around 2070 , although it would have occurred in younger age groups and major urban areas rather earlier than that , ’ professor @entity21 said			2
the study suggests significant changes in the ethnic make - up of @entity1 in the next four decades calming words : the @entity1 will not have ' another @entity61 situation , ' @entity62 , seen speaking in @entity63 , @entity64 , said regarding the possible influx of migrants from new @entity68 nations ‘ but 57 years is a long time			1
that is looking far into the future and only illustrates the consequences of things remaining as they were in 2010			0
it assumes , for example , no enduring effect of the current @entity76 ’s attempts to reduce net immigration			0
’ the projections of which countries are likely to have the most ethnically mixed populations says that @entity1 will become more mixed than the @entity19 shortly after 2050			2
however , the @entity19 estimates count black @entity19 descended from slaves and native americans as one with the white @entity19 population , and regard only more recent arrivals as migrants or members of ethnic minority groups			0
the study predicted that @entity1 will have a higher migrant and ethnic minority population than that of @entity94 when the minority share hits 28 per cent in about 20 years			1
professor @entity21 said : ‘ by about 2010 , people with immigrant origins – that is first or second - generation foreign origin – comprised between 10 and 20 per cent of the population in many western @entity10 countries			0
‘ these projections indicate that populations of post-war immigrant origin will comprise between 20 and 40 per cent of national population totals by the middle of the 21st century if recent migration trends persist			0
’ according to the @entity1 national census in 2011 , @entity108 , @entity109 and @entity110 have populations where the majority of people are either foreign or ethnic minority members			2
@entity116 is likely to become another so - called ‘ minority majority ’ city by 2020			0
several @entity120 boroughs have a non-white @entity1 majority population , including @entity122 in @entity120 , where only one in six of the population is white @entity1			0
the projections of population change in the @entity1 do not take account of @entity128 plans to limit net immigration to the tens of thousands			1

@entity1 to experience one of the biggest changes in population , study says
by 2050 non-whites and foreigners could account for 38 *%* of people in @entity1
@entity62 claims arrivals @entity142 and @entity144 will be limited
