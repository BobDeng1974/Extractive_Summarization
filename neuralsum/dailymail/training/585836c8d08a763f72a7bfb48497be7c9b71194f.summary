by @entity0 and @entity1 sweating through 28 - hour shifts in the malarial jungle of the lowlands of south - east @entity6 , prospectors brave the perils of collapsing earth and limb - crushing machinery to gather a few grams of gold			1
most of the wildcat miners in @entity13 come from impoverished @entity15 communities and barely earn subsistence wages for their backbreaking labour			1
to ward off fatigue and avoid fatal accidents they chew coca , a mild herbal stimulant endemic to the region that is the basis of the drug cocaine			0
the @entity62 aims powerful jets of water at earth walls , releasing the soils that hold the sought after flecks of gold a miner stands next to a tube used to transport soil removed from a crater to a sluice - like contraption to filter gold			1
artisanal gold miners began carving the lawless , series of ramshackle settlement out of the jungle in 2008			1
they are working up to the last minute , for they know they will be soon be evicted miners ready a @entity62 after hauling the device about 16 - meters down into a crater at a gold mine process in @entity35 a miner uses a boot the radiator of a @entity62 with water			1
some miners buried equipment when the crackdown began , only to unearth it days later when no raid came a miner operates a rustic hydraulic mining machine , known locally as a ' @entity97 ' life is cheap in the mining camps			1
deaths go unrecorded and the mercury they use to bind gold flecks compounds the risks			2
it does n't just seep into the food chain			0
it poisons them and their families , too			0
and now a new threat now looms for the estimated 20,000 wildcat miners who toil in a huge scar of denuded @entity114 rainforest known as @entity35 , an area nearly three times the size of @entity116 @entity6 's government declared all informal mining illegal on april 19 and began a crackdown			1
it raided the older boomtown of @entity122 , dynamiting backhoes , trucks and generators			0
troops even destroyed the outboard motors of canoes used to ferry mining equipment across the @entity131 river			2
in @entity35 , miners fear they are next			2

some buried their equipment after the crackdown began , only to unearth it days later when no raid came			0
but come it eventually will , the government says , because no legal mining concessions exist in @entity35			2
a miner roughly estimates his handful of gold he mined , after working for more than 24 - hours in @entity35 a miner rests with a newspaper on top of a rustic sluice - like contraption			0
engine noise is the characteristic sound of this @entity114 jungle territory nearly three times the size of @entity116 there are no trees , only hills of moved earth and artificial ponds of brown water where gold is mined a miner naps near his workstation after working a mammoth 28 - hour shift extracting gold from the soil @entity168 , 2 , sits in the shallow waters of a polluted lagoon as her parents mine for gold nearby			1
the lagoon emerged as a result of miners bombarding the earth with jet streams of water in search of gold			2
it is likely to be contaminated with mercury , used to make amalgams of the gold flecks after it stopped raining , @entity185 tied his father 's raincoat around himself while playing next to their satellite tv dish in the front yard of their temporary home a motortaxi delivers a cargo of mattresses to a mining camp in @entity35 , where an estimated 20,000 wildcat miners toil in a malarial expanse of denuded rainforest authorities are acting on international pressure to head off an incipient environmental catastrophe in the region			1
the @entity205 , an @entity206 , says the destructive mining methods raze trees , devastate habitats , contaminate waterways and endanger public health			0
in @entity13 alone an estimated 30 to 40 tons of mercury are dumped into the environment annually , @entity205 claims			0
the liquid metal , a potent neurotoxin , is used to amalgamate gold particles and then burned off – generally without even rudimentary technology to protect workers ’ health or capture waste or fumes			0
it also bleeds into the surrounding ecosystem			0
@entity224 bioaccumulates throughout the food chain to become concentrated in top predators , such as large river fish and carnivorous birds			0
the advance of the miners into the virgin forest has also led to conflict over land use rights , with many communities illegally invaded by prospectors looking for the next rich seam			0
last october , researchers using airborne mapping and satellite monitoring estimated that the area affected by illegal mining had increased 400 per cent between 1999 and 2012			1
a mining camp lines the horizon in @entity244 in @entity35 say that if the authorities eradicate their livelihood , it must fulfil promises to provide new jobs @entity251 miners wait their turn to melt their amalgam of gold and mercury to burn off the mercury in the temporary home of a gold buyer in @entity35 a sex worker who is employed by an informal bar waits for customers in @entity35			1
no one knows how much gold @entity13 contains , but @entity6 as a whole ranks sixth globally and first in @entity265 in gold production a sex worker who is employed by an informal bar playfully sticks out her tongue while posing for a photo , outside her place of her employment in @entity35 a sex worker sits with potential customers at the informal bar ' @entity276 ' , or ' @entity277 ' in @entity278 , in @entity35 in @entity6 's @entity13			1

@entity251 miners sift soil for gold in an area of stripped rainforest three times the size of @entity116
they barely earn subsistence wages , yet risk life and limb with *improvised* machinery and use of mercury
@entity6 's government has *launched* a crackdown against the illegal mining , but locals say officials must provide new jobs
