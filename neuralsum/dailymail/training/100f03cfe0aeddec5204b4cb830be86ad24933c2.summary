@entity0 offers his observations from the @entity2			1
this time the former @entity4 batsman talks wine , @entity6 nightlife and @entity4 's woes			1
things might not be going well on the field for @entity4 but you ca n’t be miserable in @entity6			1
i even ended up in a wine drinking contest , ‘ the battle of the bubbles ’ in @entity15			2
@entity4 captain @entity16 ( left ) in discussion with head coach @entity18 in training this was @entity22 sparkling wine up against @entity6 ’ s judged by wine masters including @entity24			1
would you believe it was a victory for @entity4 ! a wine called @entity28 won the blind tasting from 24 bottles			1
might be the only thing @entity4 win here … invited out to @entity34 ’s farm 20 minutes outside @entity35			1
he ’s got 70 cows and a sit - on tractor ! @entity6 captain @entity38 ( left ) talks with @entity4 captain @entity16 the former @entity41 and @entity6 batsman and @entity43 coach is now an @entity44 mentor with @entity45 and did he have some tales to tell			1
@entity34 ’s got a fantastic cricket brain and was fascinating on what constitutes a 50 - over team …			2
to walk round @entity35 now is an eerie experience			2
i went to the memorial service for the victims of the earthquake exactly four years ago that devastated this beautiful city and it was very moving to see people , arms round each other , who had obviously lost loved ones			0
you just can not get your bearings in the city centre			0
there are portacabins set up as shops and even banks			0
it will clearly take a long time for this place to get back up on its feet			0
@entity4 stumble on and they were quite pitiful to watch in their opening two matches			1
having been there as coach i watch @entity18 closely and he looks to be ageing by the day			1
@entity4 coach @entity18 looks to be ageing by the day according to @entity79 his biggest disappointment will be that @entity4 just did n’t compete against @entity81 and @entity6			1
you feel powerless and shell - shocked in @entity18 position … went out for a beer with two of my local co-commentators @entity89 and @entity90 to what they said was a quiet spot in @entity15			2
it was called the @entity94 and i ’ve never been anywhere like it			0
@entity97 is not the word			0
it was full of bowls of monkey nuts and their party piece is for everyone to eat them , throw the shells on the floor and then the pigeons come in to eat them all up			0
i made my excuses and left …			0
@entity6 were all over @entity4 like a cheap suit and @entity38 is undoubtedly the best captain in world cricket			2
@entity6 captain @entity38 is undoubtedly the best captain in world cricket , according to @entity116 he does n’t do funky fields			0
he just knows where to put the fielders for every batsman			0
and when he had done that and bundled @entity4 out he went after them as if he had a train to catch			2
they are serious contenders but how will they go against @entity81 ?			0

@entity4 were beaten in their opening two matches at the @entity2
@entity18 ' side were pitiful , according to @entity0
