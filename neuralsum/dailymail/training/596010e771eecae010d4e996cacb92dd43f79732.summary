@entity0 was almost penniless when he left @entity1 in 2005 to start a new life in the @entity3			1
eight years later he returned a rich man and built a large house in his dusty neighborhood on the outskirts of @entity8			2
flush with money , he drove an @entity10 and a @entity11 and started a music career under the artistic name ' @entity14 '			0
but two weeks ago , his flash lifestyle caught up with him when a swarm of @entity1 police descended on his home and arrested him			1
@entity19 : the accused credit card fraudster , @entity0 , found living in @entity1 , poses on @entity21 with wads of cash on his biceps taking advantage : like @entity3 music producers the videos he appeared in includes guns , strobe lights and scantily clad women no taste : in the @entity1 fugitive 's rich video he says ' i have a lot of money in the bank , ' he croons while throwing piles of cash around ' it was dramatic			1
there were dozens of cops , in cars , sirens blaring			0
they blocked off the street , ' said one neighbor who asked not to be identified			0
it is not clear what charges the 28 - year - old @entity0 faces in @entity1 but , whatever they are , the @entity3 government also wants to bring him in			1
@entity55 court records show he is a fugitive and faces up to 16 years in prison after he was indicted on sept. 30 in a @entity58 credit card fraud probe involving $ 150,000 of purchases at stores including @entity61 and @entity62			1
in recent years , dozens of @entity66 , credit card and mortgage fraudsters who came to the @entity3 from @entity1 have avoided prosecution by jumping bail and fleeing to their homeland			1
under president @entity75 's new @entity1 policy , the fraudsters , who have cost @entity3 tax payers hundreds of millions of dollars , could finally come under the long arm of @entity3 law			1
talks aimed at restoring diplomatic relations after decades of hostility began this week in @entity8 , and @entity3 officials say issues of legal cooperation will be raised in the months ahead			1
show - off : the young music artist publicly flaunted his riches : a spacious new house , a fleet of motorcycles and luxury cars , designer clothes and stately furniture @entity93 status : he was wanted in the @entity3 for stealing people 's credit card numbers and ripping off stores across @entity55 caught : @entity1 police earlier this month raided the gated home of a @entity3 fugitive in the town of @entity101 , outside @entity8 justice : @entity1 officials are n't talking , but pictures and video shot by neighbors show armed , @entity108 - like teams standing guard outside @entity0 's home in the past there has been occasional cooperation regarding low level fugitives , including a @entity55 couple repatriated in 2013 after they kidnapped two small sons they had lost custody of due to a drug arrest and fled to @entity1 on a sailboat			1
' we would hope to be able to expand some of that cooperation in the future as more normal relations go forward , and to have , frankly , a better relationship on that kind of issue , ' a senior @entity121 official said this week			0
' we are starting to compile a list of those fugitives that we believe may have flown back to their native country , ' said @entity132 , spokesman for the @entity133 in @entity134			0
' but as you can imagine it 's very hard to confirm if they are there			0
it 's not like we can call the @entity3 embassy and ask them - at least not yet			2
' not so in the case of @entity0 who posted dozens of photos of himself in @entity1 on social media			2
' he 's all over @entity145 so we can pretty much verify he is there , ' said @entity132 , who confirmed that @entity0 has an outstanding federal warrant			0
for days after his arrest , @entity1 police were stationed outside his single story hacienda - style home occupying almost an entire block , and several officers were seen inside apparently conducting an inventory			1
it is not clear why @entity0 was arrested or on what charges and no mention was made of the raid in @entity1 media			2
@entity1 's government does not usually comment on police actions			1
no tact : @entity0 , 28 , posted hundreds of pictures of himself on @entity21 living in @entity1 like a @entity165 celebrity arrogance : about a week ago , a spanish - language station in @entity134 , featured news of @entity0 's arrest , friends and fans on social media began praising him their @entity173 animosity means @entity1 and the @entity3 have no extradition agreement or law enforcement cooperation treaty , although that could change once diplomatic relations are restored			1
despite their differences , the two countries have for long cooperated on immigration issues and drug trafficking			0
but building closer law enforcement ties would still be a huge step in @entity1 's one - party system , where the police and the military are under the control of the ruling @entity188			1
the most prominent political fugitive in @entity1 is @entity190 who escaped a @entity192 state prison following her life sentence conviction for killing a state trooper in 1973			2
but there are a host of others wanted for financial crimes			0
since 2007 , @entity3 authorities have been cracking down on @entity66 fraud , arresting and charging about 2,000 people who collectively have falsely billed more than $ 6 billion to the government health program for the elderly and disabled			1
most arrests were made in south @entity55 , often involving @entity1 immigrants			2
' they have got it down to a science ... when they get caught they know they can skip bail and get away to @entity1			2
it 's their business model , ' said @entity215 , the lawyer for @entity0 's girlfriend , @entity216 , who is charged in the same credit card fraud case			1
@entity215 said the scale of the problem is hard for @entity1 to ignore			0
' they have to cooperate somewhat if they want to have a normal relationship			0
they know where everybody is on the island			0
they could round up everyone overnight and fill a plane and have them in @entity134 in the morning			0
hopefully judgment day is coming			0
' the @entity233 provided @entity234 with a list of 64 south @entity55 @entity66 fugitives , all but six from @entity1 , though the number could be higher as some investigations may be under seal			2
among them is @entity241 , wanted on charges he laundered $ 238 million stolen from @entity66			0
three brothers - @entity244 , @entity245 and @entity246 - are accused of running 11 @entity248 clinics that swindled $ 110 million from @entity66			0
@entity55 judges are increasingly taking a harder line on fraud involving recently arrived @entity1 , refusing bond and imposing tough jail sentences			1
last week , federal judge @entity254 ordered @entity216 jailed after she appeared in court on bond to change her plea to guilty and offered to cooperate with prosecutors			0
' there are too many people who have fled , ' @entity254 said			0
lavish lifestyle : @entity0 built a large , white house with pool and hot tub , marble floors , and wraparound porch â€” then walled it off from neighbors breaking the rules : @entity0 's mistake is that he lived too openly and too ostentatiously for a communist state out of time : in the past , @entity1 - born criminals escaped to the island with their riches , well out of reach of @entity3 authorities - but now the past is catching up to @entity0			1
