click here for your ultimate stats guide to the game , including @entity5 's heat map if @entity5 had cost £ 100million he would still be worth it			1
what an introduction to @entity10 football the @entity11 international has made			0
he took his goal tally to seven in four games since arriving from @entity15 for £ 32m with a hat - trick against @entity17 , the only other club with a 100 per cent record going into this clash , as @entity20 stayed top of the @entity22			1
no wonder @entity24 was on his feet beaming like a child on christmas morning by the time @entity5 had completed his treble			1
@entity20 have searched for two years to find @entity29 ’s replacement			0
needless to say they have found it			0
‘ seven in four is maybe too much			0
it is something that is not normal			0
we can not expect that after eight matches he will have 14 goals			2
‘ everyone knows now why @entity20 did well to wait for him rather than buying one in the midwinter last season , just to buy a striker			2
‘ @entity29 had a fantastic career at @entity20			0
@entity5 has shown he can have that same profile of career , but we do n’t need to compare careers			1
’ all this after a week of recuperation at @entity20 ’s @entity107 following a hamstring strain sustained on international duty			0
however , the ease of saturday 's win was certainly not reflected in their start , as @entity45 ’s side stormed into an 11th - minute lead			1
left - back @entity72 latched on to @entity120 ’s defence splitting pass before rolling in a low cross from the left			2
the @entity124 ’s pass was destined for @entity75 at the back - post but @entity42 , in attempting to cut out the cross , thumped the ball past @entity53 into his own net			1
the travelling support were in a frenzy			0
their manager , however , was motionless on the touchline			0
he must have been bubbling over inside though , as his side ’s excellent start to the season showed no sign of letting up			2
@entity78 and @entity76 both went close to increasing @entity17 ’s lead as @entity20 struggled during the opening exchanges			1
@entity75 , in front of @entity142 manager @entity141 who was watching in the stands , and @entity78 in particular were causing @entity20 problems			0
if @entity17 had gone 3 - 0 ahead , @entity33 could have had little complaint			1
@entity42 looked dismayed after @entity17 took the lead at @entity147 against @entity33 's side @entity17 celebrate their opening goal after @entity42 managed to score an own goal past goalkeeper @entity53 @entity5 , who had to undergo a late fitness test , managed to shake off a slight knock to start against @entity17 the visitors were bright , inventive and dangerous			1
@entity20 on the other hand were lethargic , sloppy and inefficient			0
slowly but surely , however , @entity33 ’s men awoke from their saturday afternoon slumber			1
@entity60 and @entity57 wasted free - kicks , both won by @entity62 , in threatening positions , before @entity59 failed to direct a header goalwards following a cross from @entity54			0
the @entity161 international then saw his low effort from the edge of the penalty area saved by @entity49 , before @entity62 fired a cross-come - shot wide after an excellent pass by @entity57			0
@entity20 were not merely turning the screw , they were tightening it			0
so it was no surprise when the home side pulled level in the final minute of the first half			0
the scorer was not a surprise either			0
fans , officials and players paid tribute to @entity20 fan @entity179 who passed away on august 24 @entity20 's starting line - up applaud to celebrate the life of legendary film director @entity179 @entity20 paid homage to @entity179 by placing him on the cover of their official matchday programme @entity57 is congratulated by his team - mates after he sets up @entity5 for the striker 's second goal @entity5 jumps in the air after scoring against @entity17 - while @entity20 fans celebrate his goal from the @entity147 stands @entity5 places the ball past @entity49 to score his third goal of the afternoon it was , of course , @entity5 with the simplest of headers from @entity57 ’s corner after some slack @entity17 marking , as the @entity198 became the first @entity20 player to score in his first four games for the club since @entity202 in 1928			1
@entity5 nearly scored again in the 52nd minute but his goalward volley from another @entity57 corner deflected off hazard before flying wide			1
but he did not have to wait much longer — just three more minutes in fact — finishing off an attractive move to score his sixth of the season , one more @entity22 goal than @entity207 scored in the whole of the last campaign			2
fabregas and @entity62 cut @entity17 ’s left - hand side to shreds with some intricate passing , leaving @entity5 to fire the @entity198 ’s cut - back past @entity49 to put @entity20 ahead			1
their abject start was a distant memory now ; @entity20 were vibrant and threatening , looking every inch title contenders			0
and @entity5 sealed all three points for @entity33 ’s men with another simple finish , tapping past @entity49 after @entity61 ’ mishit shot from the edge of the area			1
the striker was given a huge ovation , perhaps the biggest round of applause coming from owner @entity24 , as he was replaced by debutant @entity38 with 20 minutes remaining			1
and it took the @entity233 international just 10 minutes to open his account following his move from @entity39 , firing an unstoppable right - foot drive past @entity49 after @entity59 ’s pass			0
@entity17 's defenders such as @entity71 , pictured , failed to cope with the outstanding @entity5 @entity20 new boy @entity38 replaced fellow striker @entity5 in the 72nd minute @entity20 boss @entity33 congratulated hat - trick hero @entity5 after the @entity241 striker was replaced by @entity38 @entity142 national team boss @entity141 watched the game between @entity20 and @entity17 at @entity147 @entity38 was in buoyant mood after he grabbed a goal on his debut against the @entity247 at the bridge defenders @entity42 and @entity55 congratulate @entity38 after the @entity233 scores on his @entity20 debut @entity61 also congratulated new team - mate @entity38 following the @entity233 's first goal for the west @entity254 outfit @entity73 scored a consolation for @entity17 four minutes from time			1
‘ maybe we should have added one or two after going ahead but second half you saw the power and quality @entity20 have			0
we could n’t quite contain them , ’ said @entity45			0
‘ we were committed , had a good attitude and tried to play well but i think they ’ll be champions			0
’ it is hard to argue with the @entity17 manager on this evidence			2
@entity5 and @entity57 combined to devastating effect as they continue to prove just why so many felt @entity20 won the summer transfer window			2
@entity5 now has seven goals in his opening four @entity22 games , with @entity273 recording six assists			1
@entity275 @entity57 laid on for two of @entity5 ’s three goals in a display that showed an underlying understanding the pair have already manufactured			1
even though they are both @entity11 internationals and have played together fleetingly before , the sharpness with which they already read each other ’s games will be alarming to title rivals			0
@entity286 @entity57 ’ first movement when picking up possession in midfield is to look for the run of @entity5			2
the striker can come short as well as spin off defenders , offering different options for his midfielder			2
@entity295 statistics rarely lie : @entity5 now has a remarkable seven goals after 14 attempts on goal this season			1
@entity57 , therefore , knew not to panic when the @entity301 went one down			2
there is a calmness about both that means @entity20 rarely lose sight of the bigger picture - even if behind in games			2
the mourinho effect @entity33 noted @entity57 ’ willingness to get forward during a dispiriting first half during which the @entity198 was caught out of position all too often			2
the manager pushed @entity57 further forward at half - time and he enjoyed the run of @entity147			1
@entity316 it ’s fairly simple how @entity20 have already benefitted from the pair signing at @entity319			0
@entity5 now has more league goals than @entity207 managed throughout last season while @entity57 intuition in the final third has lessened the creative burden on @entity62			1
@entity17 striker @entity325 of @entity17 beats @entity53 and @entity55 but fails to score during the @entity22 encounter @entity17 midfielder @entity73 scored a late consolation goal for the away side @entity329 winger @entity58 came off the bench to make a rare appearance for the @entity301 @entity62 was a constant threat for @entity20 throughout the match at @entity147 @entity17 boss @entity45 raises his hands in the air after watching his side concede four goals against @entity22 leaders @entity20 click here for all facts , stats and graphics from the big match at @entity147 , including @entity5 's heat map			1
