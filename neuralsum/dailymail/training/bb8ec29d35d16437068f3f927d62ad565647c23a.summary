@entity6 , 76 , says her life has been ruined by the new development which dwarfs her four - bedroom detached home in @entity11 , @entity12			1

living in a goldfish bowl : the @entity23 looms over @entity6 and her house , which she claims will ruin her life the grandmother - of - eight has been unable to sell her £ 240,000 home after buyers were put off by the fact that students will be able to see everything going on there			1
retired receptionist @entity6 and her late husband @entity33 , who died this year aged 77 , battled the council for three years before the building work began			1
mrs @entity6 says she can not continue to live in the shadow of the @entity23 - which will cater for 2,000 pupils from january			1
' i am dreading the school term because i know that it wo n’t be long before literally thousands of pupils will be overlooking my house , ' she said			1
painful : @entity6 , has been unable to sell her £ 240,000 home because the giant building is 20ft from her back fence ' almost every classroom will have a birds - eye - view of my bedroom and i ’ve worked it out that i wo n’t even be able to make a cup of tea without being watched			1
' i feel like i ’m under siege			0
since my husband passed away this year i ’ve been trying to sell up but no one wants to buy because of the new school being built			2
tragic : @entity6 's late husband @entity54 , pictured , had fought with her to stop the building of the @entity23 , but he died this year ' there ’s going to be 2,000 children there , there ’s going to be three playgrounds			1
' when i complained to the council i was told not to worry because the pupils will be facing the other way but that ’s not the point - my home will be like a goldfish bowl with nowhere to hide			2
' we ’ve had some good weather this summer but i ca n’t go out in the garden and i ca n’t hang washing out because the builders are all there			2
' and it will be the same when all the children are there			0
i have n’t been in my garden for 12 months and it ’s not going to change now			2
' the school overlooks my house , it ’s at least 60ft high			1
i used to look out over fields but now i ’m going to be viewed from wherever i am in my house			0

@entity93 , @entity6 ’s daughter , said : ' we ’re just nothing to the council , it ’s a joke how people can be treated like this			2
' they just sit there shrugging their shoulders			0
' it ’s absolutely disgusting what can be done to a 76 - year - old woman			0
' the council should have bought my mum ’s house under a compulsory purchase order			0
' disruption : since planning permission was granted a year ago the building has sprung up at an incredible pace blot : this digger shows just how close the work has been to the grandmother - of - eight 's home council bosses have maintained that the plans were passed after consultation with residents			1
a planning report to members recommended approval on the grounds that it was far enough away from houses and would not result in extra traffic .			0
