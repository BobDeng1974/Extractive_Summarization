@entity0 announced @entity1 as their new manager , despite the @entity3 insisting he is ' slightly surprised ' with the club 's announcement			1
though the 18 - month deal is yet to be confirmed by those in the @entity1 camp , there have been a fair few @entity11 managers try their luck abroad			1
here , @entity13 look at how other @entity11 managers have fared abroad throughout history			2
@entity0 announced @entity1 as their new manager , despite the @entity3 being ' slightly surprised ' @entity16 perhaps the most successful @entity11 coach to have managed abroad			1

despite struggling to curb @entity24 's party antics , @entity16 led @entity21 to back to back @entity26 titles			1
after an unsuccessful spell at @entity28 , @entity16 won successive @entity30 titles at @entity31 before landing one of the top jobs in @entity35 football - that of @entity38 manager			1
@entity16 won the @entity39 and the @entity40 during his first season at the club , but that did not save him from the sack			0
@entity45 and @entity46 , who both worked with @entity16 , owe a huge debt of gratitude to the late @entity49 , as does @entity50 , who played under him at @entity38			0
@entity16 coached some of the best players in world football , including former @entity55 striker @entity54 , who described his old coach as ' a father figure ' during their time together at @entity38			0
sir @entity16 is perhaps considered the most successful @entity11 manager that tried his luck abroad @entity61 another man to have been in the hot seat at @entity0			1
@entity61 in fact managed @entity0 on no fewer than three occasions during a management career that has taken the @entity67 to eight countries			1
@entity61 guided @entity0 to their second @entity40 in history 27 years ago and then went to @entity70			1
@entity61 won the @entity71 in his first year after a team containing the likes of @entity74 , @entity75 and a young @entity76 scored 107 goals			1

@entity61 also managed @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity86 , @entity87 and @entity88 in @entity89			0
now he manages @entity91 side @entity90			0
@entity61 took to the hot seat at @entity0 on no less than three occasions during his career @entity95 another multi-lingual coach who has travelled the length and breadth of the world			1
@entity95 started his career in @entity100 , winning the title on two occasions with @entity103			0
he then won the @entity104 five years in a row with @entity106 before moving to @entity107 where he managed the national side after a spell with @entity110			0
after leading the @entity107 to their first major championships in 28 years , @entity95 departed for @entity113 where he coached the likes of @entity115 , @entity116 and @entity117 to a @entity119 final in 1997 , which they lost to @entity122			0
@entity95 managed @entity113 again and had spells in @entity124 , @entity125 and the @entity126 before returning to @entity18			0
now - @entity18 manager @entity95 pictured during his time at @entity113 boss as one of his spells abroad @entity131 after tasting success at @entity134 and @entity135 , the @entity38 board handed @entity131 the manager 's job at the @entity138 upon the recommendation of sir @entity16			1
' @entity131 ' as he became known , spent three years at @entity38			0
he won the league in his first year at the @entity142 club and guided them to the 1986 @entity144 final where they lost to @entity145 in a penalty shootout			1
despite the arrival of @entity148 and @entity149 , @entity38 could not win and lost out to @entity70 by one point in ' 87 and @entity131 was dismissed soon after			0
@entity131 resigned in shame from his only other role away from @entity11 , that of @entity154 coach			0
the @entity154 had led 3 - 1 in their @entity155 play - off against @entity157 , but conceded two late goals and therefore missed out on @entity159 ' 98 despite extensive backing from the national football association			2
@entity38 handed @entity131 ( right ) the manager 's job at the @entity138 upon @entity16 's recommendation @entity165 the current @entity167 manager went to @entity168 to rebuild his reputation following a disastrous spell in charge of @entity18			2
the move paid off as he led @entity173 to their maiden @entity26 title in his second year in charge			2
he was then appointed @entity177 coach , but was sacked just nine months later			0
@entity165 returned to @entity173 for a second time but lasted just over a year before resigning due to supporter unrest			2
@entity165 led @entity173 to their maiden @entity26 title in his second year in charge in @entity168			2

@entity1 is ' slightly surprised ' @entity0 have announced the deal
