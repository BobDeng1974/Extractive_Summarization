it ’s a question @entity1 is asked after every match : ‘ can your side match @entity6 ’s invincibles ? ’ he does n’t want to			1
that would mean drawing a further 10 @entity9 matches and getting knocked out of the @entity11 quarter - finals			1
@entity6 ’s 2003 - 04 side is legendary			1
undoubtedly @entity14 ’s greatest achievement , one of the most fondly - remembered teams in history won the title in emphatic fashion without losing a game			2
videos scroll down to watch @entity22 have made a stellar start this season , sitting top of the league and are unbeaten in all competitions @entity28 boss @entity1 has guided @entity22 to an an average of 2.64 points per game this term it had only ever been achieved before once – by @entity33 in 1888 - 89			1
quite rightly , @entity14 ’s team were hailed from all corners , christened ‘ the @entity36 ’ and became the benchmark against which all great sides in the future were judged			0
now , 11 years on , @entity14 and @entity6 are one of a host of big sides with a season on the verge of crumbling , huge questions being asked of the manager , the players and the club ’s hierarchy			2
the only question being asked of runaway league leaders @entity22 , it seems , is whether they can match @entity54 ’s incredible feat. @entity6 are the only team in @entity9 history to go unbeaten to date on their way to the 2003 - 04 title but will it matter to @entity1 ? while he ’s always been a fan of getting one over @entity14 – either on the pitch or in the press room – matching that @entity6 side ’s points total would mean a huge downturn in form at this point			1
the unspoken fact on the @entity68 ’ incredible season is they drew 12 games , winning 26			2
only one title winner has won fewer games since then – @entity74 with 23 in 2011			2
@entity6 could have lost seven and won just four of those 12 matches and finished on a higher points total			1
their eventual tally of 90 would not have been enough to win the title in the next two seasons			0
@entity22 currently have 29 points from 11 games – an average of 2.64 points per game			2
keeping this up for an entire season would see them finish on 100			0
@entity6 boss @entity14 ( left ) and @entity1 ( right ) have a fractious relationship @entity22 " untouchable " - @entity14 @entity90 ( back ) scored @entity22 's goal in their 1 - 1 draw against @entity74 in october ( 4 - 4 - 2 ) @entity94 ; @entity95 , @entity96 , @entity97 , @entity98 ; @entity99 , @entity100 , @entity101 , @entity102 ; @entity103 , @entity54			1
@entity1 ’s side have drawn two matches so far – at the homes of both @entity108 clubs			0
with 27 games to play , having already been to @entity110 , the @entity111 , @entity112 and @entity113 , sharing points a further 10 times would hardly put a smile on @entity1 ’s face			0
the business @entity22 did in the summer set them up for this blistering start			2
@entity1 identified key weaknesses in last season ’s side and sealed moves for @entity100 and @entity103 early			0
those two in particular , along with the league ’s best defence and others such as @entity102 and @entity128 have formed the core of a side among the best and seemingly most consistent in @entity131			0
@entity100 ( left ) and @entity103 have proven a hit at @entity22 since joining this summer @entity1 is also used to fighting on different fronts			0
while the mental strength involved in going a domestic campaign has n’t been matched , @entity6 had already lost two @entity11 matches – to @entity137 and @entity138 – by this point			1
@entity22 remain unbeaten in all competitions			1
the feat of being unbeaten consumed @entity14 and his side – they drew five of their last 10 games against the likes of @entity147 , @entity148 and a @entity150 side that finished in 14th			0
that run - in was mostly without the distraction of @entity11 football			2
having been drawn in the quarter - finals against a newly - rich @entity22 side under @entity156 , @entity6 faltered and were beaten at home in the second leg thanks to a @entity160 goal			1
@entity160 's ( right ) goal dumped @entity6 out of the @entity11 quarter - finals in the 2003 - 04 season the @entity28 ’ side , lopsided as it may have been and under an inferior manager , showed greater steel to clinch the tie over two legs			1
the competition that year was there for the taking			0
the semi-finalists were the inconsistent @entity22 , @entity173 , @entity174 and a @entity176 side managed by a certain @entity1			0
while it seemed @entity1 was destined for that particular honour and @entity156 ’s tinkering put paid to @entity22 ’s hopes , @entity6 ’s team was far more talented than any of those semi-finalists			1
@entity1 has been in the @entity11 semi-final for the last five years			0
a quarter - final exit with the talent he has at his disposal this time around would represent failure			0
@entity6 ’s legendary team reaching the semi-finals of both domestic cup competitions is to be commended , although they fell in the @entity190 against @entity191			1
@entity22 were knocked out at the semi-finals stage of the @entity11 last term to @entity194 when @entity1 insists his side wo n’t go unbeaten in the league , he could well be right			1
he will be demanding to be challenging in all competitions until the send of the season , and difficult matches in quick succession against teams fighting for their lives breeds occasional slip - ups			0
he will be livid , though , to draw another 10 @entity9 matches and exit the @entity11 at the quarter - finals			1
that @entity6 side deserve their gold @entity9 trophy , and their place in the pantheon of great teams			1
but it will be no black mark over this @entity22 team if they do n’t go unbeaten			2
they could very easily have an even better season			0
@entity28 captain @entity97 will be hoping to lead @entity22 to silverware this season			0

@entity22 sit top of the @entity9 and are unbeaten in all competitions
blues lost in the @entity11 semi-finals to @entity194 last term
@entity6 won the 2003 - 04 title unbeaten with 26 wins and 12 draws
*gunners* were knocked out of the @entity11 by @entity22 that year
