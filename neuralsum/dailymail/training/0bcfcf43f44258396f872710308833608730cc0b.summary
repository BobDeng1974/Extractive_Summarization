by @entity1 reporter published : 17:43 est , 16 october 2013 updated : 19:11 est , 16 october 2013 early screenings of the upcoming blockbuster about @entity4 has opened the floodgates of criticism as the film 's director and the studio are at odds over the interpretation			1
the @entity12 states that the epic film , titled @entity4 , has been screened in front of three audiences with different faith backgrounds and was met with mixed reviews			1
the $ 125million film was shown to a largely @entity20 audience in @entity21 , a mainly @entity23 crowd in @entity24 and a mixed group in @entity26			2
his vision : @entity28 , the director behind @entity29 and @entity30 , has spoken about how has wanted to create a film about @entity4 's story since he was a boy director @entity28 also introduced the exclusive trailer to an audience at the @entity35 led by a @entity36 in july and it was widely praised by attendees who posted messages about it on @entity40 after the fact			1
interpretation : questions have been raised about @entity28 's vision for the film as he has previously stated that he views @entity4 as ' the first environmentalist ' ' just saw the trailer for @entity28 's " @entity4 "			1
it looks like it 's gon na be off the chain , ' @entity40 user @entity48 wrote			0
the project is a personal one for @entity28 , whose recent films @entity29 and @entity30 were nominated for @entity55			0
at the @entity35 conference , the @entity12 says that he said that he has dreamed of making a film about @entity4 's story since the seventh grade when he wrote a poem about the biblical figure			1
the poem won an award and he read it in front of the @entity64 which he said ' gave me the courage and spirit to be a writer			0
so @entity4 's very much been a patron saint in my life leading me toward my creative endeavors			0
' this vision is apparently one that he does not appreciate being messed with , as unidentified sources told @entity12 that he has been ' very dismissive ' of the suggestions made by @entity76 executives			0
the studio is splitting the cost of the collossal film with @entity80 , so their input is significant but allegedly @entity28 does not care			2
film marketing consultant @entity82 saw one of the pre-screenings of @entity4 and said that it was ' an example of a director not listening to those voices that would have been warning of the dangers of veering too far away from the biblical text			2
' ' the director is there to serve the studio and the audience , not veer off into directions that go against the core audience 's beliefs - at least if the goal is to get them to come to the theater			0
' big budget : @entity101 ( left ) and @entity102 ( right ) are two of the stars in the film , which does n't use any actual animals as @entity28 chose to have them digitally created instead one such direction is an interpretation of @entity4 as ' the first environmentalist ' , which @entity28 has said in the past			1
a writer that obtained an early summary of the film - which uses a great deal of special effects and completely invented the animals that will be used alongside stars like @entity101 - and that blogger , named @entity120 said that it will be ' an uninteresting and unbiblical waste of a hundred and fifty million dollars ' .			0

director @entity28 is making a film about @entity4 that has a reported budget of $ 125m
now it has gone through screenings with mixed reviews
