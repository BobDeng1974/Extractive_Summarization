in the chaos of a burning building , a firefighter 's senses are crucial			0
when smoke clouds the air , picking up on the roar of flames , the creak of collapsing floors , radio calls and cries for help can be the difference between life and death			0
but one young recruit must do without such signs of danger - as he is deaf and can not speak			1
@entity18 , 21 , graduated from a first - stage firefighter training programme earlier this month and will soon begin volunteering at his local department in @entity21 , @entity22			1
mr @entity18 was born deaf , but his condition was not picked up until he was eight months old , when his family noticed he was not responding to sounds around him			1
doctors soon diagnosed him with a genetic disorder called @entity39 syndrome			0
but even disability could not keep the young boy from harbouring ambitions of joining the fire service - a dream he is now days away from realising			2
his mother told reporters how he had idolised firefighters when he was as young as four , and how he used to spend his nights watching documentaries about his heroes			0
challenge : mr @entity18 can communicate only through sign language and needed interpreters during his training mr @entity18 spent much of his education in mainstream schools , though he later enrolled at the @entity58			1
after graduating at the age of 19 he spent a few months at a community college , but none of the courses offered there could compare to his true calling			0
soon he began turning up to monthly meetings at the @entity67 3 fire station , where government interpreters from the @entity69 helped him find out how he could be a part of the team			1
in january he began classes with the fire school , learning all about the tricks and tools of the trade , from ladders to hoses , hazmat suits to search and rescue operations			0
before long he was out on training exercises , charging bravely into concrete buildings filled with blazing hay and helping to extinguish the flames			2
' i went to watch him one day and i was like , " @entity86 "			0
i was thinking he ’s crazy , ' his mother , @entity31 , told the @entity29			0
' i was very proud to watch him			0
he was really focused , and i was really happy to see how the class kind of all came around him to help him learn how to work inside of a fire			0
i was really proud to watch him doing such a , to me , scary thing			0
' language barrier : the young rookie is teaching his fellow firefighters to sign so they can communicate more easily on callouts determined : mr @entity18 has dreamed of being a firefighter since the age of four in training , mr @entity18 benefited from the support of his fellow students , who would tell him which way to turn by tapping his left or right leg , or tap the ladder to tell him to lift it			1
now his colleagues at the station hope to take this team spirit to the next level by learning how to communicate with mr @entity18 through sign language			1
he will be working under district chief @entity110 , who praised the rookie firefighter for his determination and independent spirit			2
together they will figure out the limitations on mr @entity18 's duties , and exactly how he will be able to help on callouts			1
though he now holds a certificate for the first stage of training , his disability means the state authorities refuse to let him work as a fully - fledged , paid crew member			1
base : mr @entity18 will join as a volunteer at the @entity67 3 fire station , in @entity21 , @entity22 mr @entity18 expects he will be able to help out with car crashes , handling hazardous materials , giving first aid and putting out brush , tree and grass fires			1
even though he will not be allowed to enter burning buildings , he will pitch in with vital support work from the outside , setting up safety equipment , hooking up fire hydrants and handling the crew 's oxygen tanks			0
surprisingly , he is not alone in facing this unusual challenge and said he knows of a few other deaf or hearing - impaired volunteer firefighters working in @entity22			2
mr @entity18 wanted to thank the teachers and classmates who helped him towards qualification , while his proud father @entity146 pointed out what an achievement passing the training course had been - especially as only 21 of 30 students graduated			1
according to @entity152 , director of the fire school , mr @entity18 's disability is not as much of an impediment as it may seem			2
he told the @entity29 : ' the instructors and students alike all said it does n’t make a difference if you ’re deaf or blind : you ca n’t see or hear anything inside a burning building anyway , so it basically made everyone level			2

rookie @entity18 , 21 , has been unable to hear or speak since birth
interpreters helped him through training - now he is teaching his colleagues sign language
