by @entity0 published : 04:19 est , 10 january 2014 updated : 04:42 est , 11 january 2014 it may come as little surprise to long - suffering employees but new research has confirmed that your boss is far happier than you			2
top managers have a more satisfying family life , enjoy greater financial security and have a higher sense of career fulfilment , according to a comprehensive but predictable study			1
earnings may have some bearing on the job satisfaction ; half of all bosses earn more than $ 75,000 while only a third of employees take home a similar wage , the @entity16 survey found			1
snowed under : workers said they were far less satisfied with their careers than their bosses			2
( @entity28 picture ) four - in - ten top managers say they are very satisfied with their financial situation , compared to just 28 per cent of workers			1
overall about eight - in - ten bosses ( 83 per cent ) describe themselves as ' very satisfied ' with their family situation			0
in contrast , about seven - in - ten ( 74 per cent ) of workers are similarly content with their home lives			0
tough at the top : bosses are more satisfied with their family life , current job and their financial situation than their workers , a study found bosses also are more likely to say they have sufficient education and training to help them succeed ( 73 per cent vs. 57 per cent ) and to believe they are fairly paid for the work they do ( 62 per cent vs. 54 per cent )			1
senior managers are only about half as likely as workers to be looking for another job ( 12 per cent vs. 23 per cent )			0
the study of 2,002 adults also highlighted that men are far more likely than women to rise to the top			1
bad career move : bosses were less likely to complain that having children harmed their career progression - but top managers were more likely to be men , the study found top managers said having children has not been an obstacle to promotion , with only a third saying family life harmed their advancement			1
however , more than four in five workers lower down the pecking order complained that raising a family hurt their career progression			1
the survey found top managers and workers are equally likely to be found in church or attending some other religious service			1
the survey asked adults if they would like to someday be a boss or top manager			2
among all employed adults , about four - in - ten ( 39 per cent ) say they would while a roughly similar share ( 43 per cent ) say they would not			0
but 16 per cent of workers surveyed say they already are the boss or a top manager where they work			2
it is this group at or near the top of the career ladder that is the primary focus of this analysis			0
on average , bosses are about eight years older than workers ( 47 vs. 39 ) so as a group they are further along in their careers			0
only about one - in - five bosses ( 20 per cent ) and workers ( 18 per cent ) say a big salary is extremely important while somewhat similar proportions highly value a job that helps society ( 19 per cent and 23 per cent ) and opportunities for advancement ( 25 per cent and 24 per cent )			0
about half of top managers ( 52 per cent ) and employees ( 48 per cent ) say it ’s easier for a man than a woman to get a top job in government or business			1
and exactly the same proportion say men generally earn more for doing the same work ( 54 per cent for both sexes )			0
@entity120 grind : career satisfaction was lower among workers than their bosses , the @entity16 found ( @entity28 picture ) but both labor and management offer a more positive view when asked to focus on how men and women fare at their workplaces			1
seven - in - ten bosses and a similar share of workers ( 75 % ) say that men and women are paid the same for doing the same job where they work			2
equally large majorities agree that women and men have the same opportunities to advance			0
today ’s bosses also are somewhat better educated than other adults			0
according to the survey , those with college degrees ( 16 % ) or some college experience ( 15 % ) are most likely to say they are now a boss or top manager .			0
