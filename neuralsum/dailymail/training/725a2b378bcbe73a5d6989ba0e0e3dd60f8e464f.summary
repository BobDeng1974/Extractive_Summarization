a major rift has emerged within the @entity2 - speaking world , pitting @entity3 against @entity4 and @entity5 against @entity6			2
the division is between ‘ ummers ’ and ‘ errers ’ , and , while you may not be aware of it , your gender and age could have a huge influence on which group you fall into			0
men and older people prefer to use ‘ er ’ during gaps in speech , while women and teenagers are more likely to use ‘ um ’ , according to recent research			1
but in a five minute interview on the @entity32 , @entity4 ( right ) used ‘ um ’ four times , and did n't revert to using ' uh ' once for instance , during a two - minute clip of an interview with @entity3 about @entity27 , the president used ‘ uh ’ – the @entity30 equivalent of ‘ er ’ – nine times			1
‘ @entity38 ’ was not mentioned once			0
but in a five minute interview on the @entity32 , @entity4 used ‘ um ’ four times , and did n't revert to using ' uh ' once			1
research by @entity41 , a lecturer in sociolinguistics at the @entity43 , has backed up these observations			0
he recently studied 25,000 examples of people in @entity47 using ‘ um ’ or ‘ uh ’			1
‘ i was kind of surprised because i found both that there was differences between men and women , and that it seemed to be changing over generations , ’ professor @entity41 told @entity48			2
@entity5 ( top left ) and @entity6 ( top right ) both use ' um ' and ' er ' an equal amount of times			0
@entity59 ( middle right ) and @entity4 ( middle left ) use um more often			0
meanwhile @entity63 leader @entity62 ( bottom left ) and @entity3 ( bottom right ) tend to use ' er ' , or the @entity30 equivalen ' um ' , more often footballer @entity6 ( pictured ) is classed as a ' betweener '			2
he used the word ' um ' during 67 per cent of a recent interview			0
research has discovered that , overall , women tended to say ‘ um ’ 22 per cent more than men , but men used ‘ uh ’ more than twice as often as women some people , fall into the ‘ betweener ’ category			1
speaking with @entity79 last year , a random two minute - segment of his interview showed @entity5 ( left ) using ‘ uh ’ and ‘ um ’ four times each			1
in a recent two - minute interview , singer @entity81 ( right ) , used ' um ' five times and ‘ er ’ only once			2
@entity84 : @entity4 ( 100 per cent ) @entity59 ( 71 per cent ) @entity85 ( 75 per cent ) @entity81 ( 83 per cent ) @entity86 ( 90 per cent ) @entity87 : @entity62 ( 88 per cent ) @entity3 ( 100 per cent ) @entity88 ( 75 per cent ) @entity89 : @entity5 ( 50 per cent ) @entity6 ( 67 per cent ' um ' ) @entity90 ( 50 per cent ) professor @entity41 found that men prefer to say ‘ uh ’ more often than women , and people born more recently prefer ‘ um ’ more than the older generation			1
he added that the data showed women ’s preference for ‘ um ’ instead of ‘ uh ’ was much more significant , and ranged somewhere between 400 per cent and 120 per cent stronger than men ’s			1
‘ it ’s not surprising that women are leading the change because for most language trends , women are about a generation and a generation and a half ahead of men			0
’ ‘ i do n’t know why that is , ’ he said			0
‘ we do n’t have a good answer for to that			0
’ in a separate study , @entity112 , at the @entity113 , found the use of ‘ um and ‘ uh ’ can reveal the speaker 's gender , language skills and life experience			1
he transcribed 14,000 phone conversations , totalling more than 26 million words from 12,000 speakers across the @entity30			0
in a separate study , @entity112 , at the @entity113 , ( graphic pictured ) found the use of ‘ um and ‘ uh ’ can give reveal the speaker 's gender , language skills and life experience professor @entity112 discovered that men , essentially , speak like old women			1
‘ the rate of “ um ” usage for the younger men is almost the same as the rate of “ um ” usage for the older women , ’ he said			2
overall , women tended to say ‘ um ’ 22 per cent more than men , but men used ‘ uh ’ more than twice as often as women			1
and when men and women speak to each other , they try to find a middle ground , using a more equal mix of ' uh ' and ' um ' , in his earlier research , professor @entity112 also found that use of ‘ uh ’ increased with age for both men women			1
‘ males use uh about 14 per cent less often when talking with a female rather than a male , and females use uh about 20 per cent more often when talking with a male rather than a female , ’ professor @entity112 writes			0
captain of the @entity158 team , @entity86 ( in yellow ) , used nine ‘ ums ’ and one ‘ er ’ in two and a half minutes during a post-match interview @entity48 discovered that during a recent two - minute interview , singer @entity81 , used ' um ' five times and ‘ er ’ only once			2
during a 3 minute - segment of an interview with @entity168 , @entity165 used ' er ' three times and ' um ' just once			0
' some people , however , fall into the ‘ betweener ’ category			0
speaking with @entity79 last year , @entity5 used ‘ uh ’ and ‘ um ’ four times each in two minutes			1
@entity6 is also classed as a ' betweener '			0
he used the word ' um ' during 67 per cent of a recent interview according to @entity175			0
@entity176 in the @entity175 also notes that @entity62 , the @entity63 leader , used 15 ‘ ers ’ and just two ‘ ums ’ on the @entity179 show in march this year			0
meanwhile , captain of the @entity158 team , @entity86 , used nine ‘ ums ’ and one ‘ er ’ in two and a half minutes during a post-match interview			2
there are a number of different theories for the ‘ um ’ and ‘ uh ’ divide			1
some scientists believe @entity190 culture has influenced others through film and television			0
actor @entity90 is a ' betweener '			0
he used ' um ' and ' er ' three times each during a two minute segment of an interview at the @entity199 @entity198 a two - minute interview with comedienne @entity85 showed her use ‘ um ’ 75 per cent of the time , and ‘ er ’ only once			1
during a 3 minute - segment of an interview with @entity168 , @entity165 used ' er ' three times and ' um ' just once but ‘ um ’ and ‘ er ’ could also mean different things in our speech , with ‘ um ’ suggesting a longer break , and ‘ er ’ a shorter pause			1
professor @entity112 says people tend to use ‘ um ’ when they 're trying to decide what to say , and ‘ uh ’ when they 're trying to decide how to say it			1
‘ as people get older , they have less trouble deciding what to say [ because they know more stuff ] , and more trouble deciding how to say it [ because they know more words and fixed phrases , and so have a harder time making a choice ] , ’ professor @entity112 told the @entity215			2
however , professor @entity41 told @entity48 that no one can conclusively proove why there are differences in using ' um ' and ' er ' between men and women			2
professor @entity41 found that men prefer to say ‘ uh ’ more often than women , and people born more recently prefer more ‘ um ’ than the older generation			1

separate studies found that men and older people prefer using ‘ er ’
women and teenagers more likely to use ‘ um ’ during gaps in speech
in an interview , @entity3 used ‘ uh ’ – the equivalent of ‘ er ’ – 9 times
interview with @entity4 showed her use ‘ um ’ 100 *%* of the time
footballer @entity6 is classed as a ' betweener ' using a mix
trend in women is more *prominent* , claims professor @entity41
there is no conclusive theory as to why women prefer to use ' um '
