by @entity0 correspondent in @entity1 and @entity2 she has suffered from several ' @entity3 ' in the past			1
and once again the @entity5 failed to tame her skirt as she touched down in a very windy @entity1 , @entity7 , on monday			1
@entity5 's red attire was picked up in a large gust of wind as she juggled baby @entity11 and held onto her hat at the same time			1
it is not the first time @entity5 has suffered a hemline malfunction in the course of official duties			1
her navy skirt blew up at a charity event in @entity34 last november and she almost came a cropper in a floral @entity37 dress as she arrived at @entity39 airport in 2012			2
and she only narrowly avoided a wardrobe disaster at @entity41 in september 2011 when her feather - light @entity43 yellow frock headed skywards			2
hold onto your hat ! @entity5 almost also lost her very expensive red pillarbox hat smart : meanwhile , a hands - free @entity18 disembarked the plane looking dapper in a navy blue suit not again ! this is n't the first time @entity5 has suffered from a @entity15 moment - a seven months pregnant @entity5 was hit by a gust of wind in 2012 , a @entity43 yellow frock almost cost @entity5 her modesty at @entity41 in september 2011 , and she almost came a cropper in a floral @entity37 dress at @entity62 in 2012 the @entity64 's dressmaker @entity63 slips small lead curtain weights , costing just £ 1.50 for a packet of four , inside the lining of each of the @entity64 ’s exquisite hand - made outfits			1
the small circular weights , measure just 1.2inches ( 32mm ) across and weigh less than an ounce each and are sourced from @entity72			0
society dressmaker mr @entity63 stitches them into the hem of her garments , which prevents them from blowing up in the wind			0
‘ the beauty of a handmade outfit is that it hangs just right but , of course , we have a few tricks up our sleeve , ’ mr @entity63 told the @entity80 in an exclusive interview ‘ i just pop a couple into the hemline of her dresses and coats and it makes them hang beautifully			0
' if there is a flap in the coat then i will sew in one on each side of the split to even it up			0
' and sometimes if she is wearing a lightweight chiffon skirt i will sew in an even smaller lead weight the size of a pea or even a length of chain , rather like a dog ’s chain			0
but the curtain weights work beautifully			0
’ it has been suggested in the past that @entity5 should perhaps take a leaf out of the @entity64 's book			1
in 2012 , the @entity80 revealed how , despite conducting thousands of public engagements in her 60 years on the throne , the @entity64 ’s decorum has almost never slipped			0
slipped inside the lining of each of the monarch ’s exquisite handmade outfits are a couple of small lead curtain weights , costing just £ 1.50 for a packet of four			0
the small circular weights , measure just 1.2inches ( 32mm ) across and weigh less than an ounce each - but prevent the royal hemline from flying away in a gust of wind			0
designer @entity43 revealed that she 'd received a letter recommending that very trick after pictures of @entity5 in her billowing yellow dress surfaced in 2012			1
' i had a little handwritten letter from a lady in @entity135 passionately criticising me for the primrose yellow shift dress i made for the duchess , ' says @entity43 , who was born in @entity138 , told @entity34 's @entity139 at the time			2
' she said did n't i know about putting weights around the bottom of a hem so it ca n't blow up ? ' well , i did n't know it was going to be worn on a windy runway - but i did think maybe in future i will put in more weighting , just in case ... ' @entity63 , the @entity64 's favourite couturier , revealed the weights he uses for her dresses are sourced from the curtain accessories section of famous @entity153 department store , @entity72			2
society dressmaker mr @entity63 then sews them into the hem			0
the surprisingly cheap trick seems to work , for the @entity64 has seemingly never been photographed in public looking even remotely ruffled			0
‘ surprisingly , it is nothing fancy			0
i use curtain weights , lead weights , from @entity72 ’s curtain department			0
we call them penny weights			0
unfortunately not all female royals follow the @entity64 ’s lead and have , on occasions , fallen foul of the elements			0
the late @entity171 , @entity171 , the @entity172 and her daughter , princess @entity173 , have all suffered similar wardrobe malfunctions			0
@entity175 of @entity176 arrived in @entity7 wearing a pillar - box red coat by @entity178 , a @entity179 designer favoured by @entity18 ’s late mother , @entity171 , @entity171 , and a pillbox hat by @entity182			1
she was also wearing the @entity64 ’s diamond and platinum silver fern brooch , an important @entity7 emblem			1
the monarch was given the stunning piece of jewellery by the @entity189 on her own visit to the country in 1954 as part of her landmark six - month @entity195 tour			1
earlier there had been some uncertainty as to whether the flight would even be able to land after dozens of planes were diverted from @entity1 due to low cloud and heavy rain			2
but concern eventually evaporated after the couple were seen happily boarding their jet for the final stage of their journey around the world in @entity210			1
the family and their 11 - strong entourage had left @entity34 on saturday night , taking up the @entity215 section of a scheduled @entity217 flight via @entity218			2
disembarking 27 hours later in @entity219 , the @entity5 looked elegant in a @entity221 wrap dress and beige suede £ 400 @entity224 heels , as she carried her waving son in her arms			1
dressed smartly in a freshly pressed blue suit , @entity18 walked next to her carrying a battered brown holdall and a plush kangaroo backpack			2
a @entity232 @entity231 jet carried them on the last three hours of their marathon journey and will also ferry them around the country for the next ten days			1
@entity5 and her son had taken the opportunity to change during the flight , which arrived 20 minutes late and was greeted by @entity7 prime minister @entity241			1
thanks to the services of her on - board hairdresser , @entity245 – who is being paid for by @entity247 out of his private fortune – her famous flowing locks looked eminently salon - @entity250 , meanwhile , sported a summer ensemble in white			0
among the entourage seen disembarking was @entity19 ’s full - time nanny , @entity254 born @entity252 , a quiet , studious figure , who has not been seen in public before			0
while the couple ’s previous foreign tours have been dominated by chatter about @entity5 ’s wardrobe , @entity19 will clearly be the centre of attention as his parents spend the next three weeks touring @entity7 and @entity219			1
traditional : the young prince wore a cream cardigan over a white shirt , matching shorts and soft leather shoes and socks - ideal for a baby who has just started crawling			2
his outfit was a modern version of the smocked top and peach bloomer style shorts that @entity18 wore when he visited the country at the same age change of outfit : both @entity5 and her son took the opportunity to change during the flight from @entity210 to @entity1 which was delayed by 20 minutes strong gusts : the @entity283 ' pillbox hat by @entity182 managed to stay firmly in place despite the windy weather royal welcome : the family was greeted by @entity7 prime minister @entity241			1
@entity5 wore the @entity64 's diamond and platinum silver fern brooch , an important @entity7 emblem , that was presented to the @entity64 on her visit to the nation during her landmark 1953 - 54 world tour traditional welcome : @entity175 rubbed noses with a local dignitary as she and her husband were officially welcomed at @entity299 in @entity1 later on monday eyes front , @entity5 ! she chatted to several @entity302 warriors as she made her way across the soggy lawn the warmest of welcomes : @entity18 and @entity5 attended an official welcome ceremony on the lawns outside of @entity299 later on monday where they rubbed noses with local dignitaries			1
