by @entity0 published : 10:22 est , 13 june 2012 updated : 11:03 est , 13 june 2012 @entity3 's bank account was accessed by a reporter working for the @entity6 newspaper , he told the @entity7			1
@entity9 's first minister claims a former journalist from the paper told him they were intrigued by a payment made in 1999 to a shop called ' @entity15 '			1
he inferred that journalists at the sunday paper had hoped that the purchase was of an adult nature and would reveal something salacious about his private life			0
but in reality he had gone to a toy shop to buy a gift for his young nieces , he told @entity28 's inquiry into media standards			1
however , the @entity6 have denied mr @entity3 's claims			1
he said : ' my bank account was accessed by the @entity6 newspaper some time ago , in 1999 , and my reason for believing that is i was informed by a former @entity6 journalist			1
' the revelation has ' coloured his view ' of press standards , he said			0
mr @entity3 said the journalist gave him details of what was in his account			1
he added : ' i had bought some toys for my then at that time young nieces in a toy shop which was called @entity15			1
' the person who informed me told me that this caused great anticipation and hope in the @entity6 investigation unit because they believed that perhaps @entity15 was more than a conventional toy shop			1
. he continued : ' the point i 'm making is the person concerned had detail which could only have been known by somebody who had full access to my bank account at that stage			2
' courting @entity69 : @entity3 told the @entity7 today that he has met @entity69 five times in the last five years separately , the first minister said there was no evidence that he had been a victim of phone - hacking			1
this afternoon the @entity75 denied mr @entity3 's claims and said they had investigated them fully			1
a spokesman said : ' mr @entity3 first raised the matter of an alleged unauthorised access of his bank account with the @entity6 's editor last year			1
' the allegation was that a journalist working for the @entity6 had accessed his bank details in 1999			2
' as we explained to him last year , on the basis of the information he had given us , we have been unable to find any evidence to substantiate his allegation			0
' as our response to him at the time made clear , we take this allegation very seriously and if he is able to provide us with any more information we will investigate further			0
' bank claims : @entity6 , the sister paper of the @entity75 who are based in @entity97 , @entity98 , said there was no evidence they had accessed mr @entity3 's account mr @entity3 has repeatedly refused to answer questions at the @entity103 on whether he had been the victim of phone hacking , leading to accusations he has treated @entity103 with contempt			1
the first minister always insisted the @entity7 was the correct place to air the issues			0
on wider @entity9 press behaviour , he said : ' more recently i think we 'd have to accept , given the information which has now been into the hands of the police in @entity9 , there are a significant , perhaps proportionally less but significant @entity9 examples of possible criminality			0
' a number of @entity9 have been informed by police over the past year that people may have been victims of ' illegality '			0
he criticised the @entity124 for not handing over information quickly about possible criminal acts to @entity9 police			0
' it 's only in the last few months that @entity129 have examined all of that information and informed the potential victims of the possibility of criminal acts against them , ' he said			0
' that seems to me a highly undesirable situation and something similar applies to possible breaches of data protection as well			0
' @entity140 : @entity28 today heard allegations that the @entity6 accessed @entity3 's bank account the @entity144 leader has also faced pressure from his opponents about his relationship with media tycoon @entity69 , whose @entity149 tabloid was closed amid the phone hacking scandal			1
mr @entity3 told the inquiry he had been in favour of the @entity69 's @entity154 bid			1
' i was in favour of what benefited the @entity9 economy , ' he said			2
' remember i have no responsibility for broadcasting policy , i have no responsibility for plurality in the press but i do have a responsibility for jobs and investment in @entity9			0
' he added : ' i would tend to put an emphasis on the jobs and investment aspects of this			0
it was for others to consider other matters			0
' mr @entity3 said he was prepared to argue the case for jobs and investment with @entity178 , then @entity179 , but never got the chance			2
he said the issue of the @entity154 bid was never brought up in discussions about newspaper support			2
' if for example i 'd believed that the merger of the consolidation of ownership of @entity154 would have resulted in the diminution of @entity9 jobs then i would have been perfectly prepared to argue against it , ' he said			2
also , he said he never got a direct answer on potential support from mr @entity69 for the @entity144			2
mr @entity3 said : ' i would n't explicitly raise it at meetings necessarily because they 'd always say " go to the editors "			2
' that certainly was @entity69 's practice , and i ca n't even remember , it may have cropped up in a @entity201 meeting , but if so , he would say ' go to the editors			2
and go to the editors i did , as i say , sometimes successfully , sometimes not			0
' the @entity205 newspaper famously depicted @entity9 in a noose in a warning against voting @entity144 in the 2007 @entity9 election			1
the paper changed its position to back mr @entity3 for a second term as first minister in 2011			1
mr @entity3 said he had five meetings with mr @entity69 over five years			1
' it 's perfectly reasonable , ' he argued			0
' it 's not in the same league , if i may say , as mr @entity217 or mr @entity218 or mr @entity219 , but nonetheless , that 's five times in five years			2
' i saw @entity69 's evidence			1
i do n't demur from that at all			0
he said he did n't know me well , and that 's fair			0
' often we were discussing @entity9 and his @entity9 ancestry			0
the fact that his grandfather was the @entity228 minister in my old constituency of @entity230 and @entity231 in @entity232 , for example , so there were a range of things for discussion			0

@entity3 claims @entity6 accessed his bank account in the run - up to elections in 1999
he went to the @entity15 toy shop to buy presents for his young nieces
@entity9 's first minister *suggested* journalists were hoping the charge indicated something *sleazy*
the @entity6 say there is no evidence that his bank was accessed
mr @entity3 was in favour of @entity69 's @entity154 *takeover* bid
mr @entity69 's @entity9 @entity205 newspaper supports mr @entity3 despite being fierce opponents five years ago
