@entity1 boss @entity0 claimed his side ' did enough to win the game ' despite their 3 - 0 defeat to @entity6 at @entity7			1
goals from @entity9 , @entity10 and @entity11 sealed victory but it was @entity6 goalkeeper @entity14 who took the plaudits after keeping @entity1 at bay from a host of chances			1
' i thought we did enough to win the game , ' @entity0 told @entity23			0
' we created enough chances to win the game but we also made defensive mistakes			0
@entity1 manager @entity0 shows the strain during his side 's 3 - 0 shellacking at @entity7 @entity9 expertly steers the ball to give @entity6 an early lead against @entity1 @entity10 doubles @entity6 's advantage in the 40th minute with a perfectly executed header @entity11 ( right ) rounds off the rout at @entity7 in the 71st minute ' it probably epitomised our season , we 're not prolific enough in terms of goalscoring			1
' i think @entity14 was man of the match , that does n't surprise me			0
i 've seen him have four or five games like that			0
' the first half we were the better side but we ca n't concede the goals we did			0
we nearly went in front and they broke up the other end and got a goal , we lost a runner from midfield which you ca n't do			2
@entity14 ( left ) pulled off a number of outstanding saves during the games denying @entity57 ' it 's easy , we know what the solutions are but we have to keep working and hopefully the confidence will return			1
' at least we created the opportunities and if we can cut out the mistakes we 're going to be in with a chance of winning more games			2
' @entity14 said : ' i 'm really happy with the three points			0
we played a very good game and scored three goals , it 's fantastic			0
@entity1 forward @entity71 ( right ) could not find a way past the outstanding @entity14 ' the first half i saved two against ( @entity71 ) @entity71 and the second half ( @entity57 ) @entity57 , and we scored three goals and won the game			1
' @entity76 added : ' it was a very good game , outstanding from @entity14 again			2
he was absolutely brilliant - like always , my man ! ' @entity10 's goal appeared offside after a slight touch from @entity76 in the build - up , which the @entity82 owned up to afterwards			1
he said : ' i got a touch , i have to be honest ... so you can put that down as an assist ! ' a hapless @entity88 looks on after @entity1 concede their third goal of the afternoon			2

@entity9 , @entity10 and @entity11 strikes secured a 3 - 0 victory for a *rampant* @entity6 at @entity7
@entity1 missed a host of opportunities in front of goal
@entity71 and @entity57 both had clear - cut chances to score
@entity76 *praises* @entity102 's *performance* in goal
