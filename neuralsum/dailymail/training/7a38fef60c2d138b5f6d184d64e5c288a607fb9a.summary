if a male - only social network was launched that let men rate their former conquests in terms of attractiveness and sexual ability , it probably would n't go down very well			2
but somehow , a female - only equivalent is ok			2
@entity9 , which went live yesterday , is a social network , described as ' @entity11 marries @entity12 ' - and it bans boys			1
latest internet craze ? entrepreneur @entity15 has set up @entity9 , a social network that is just for women it connects through your @entity12 profile - although does not let any of your @entity12 friends know that you have connected			1
' @entity23 uses @entity12 to make registration easier			1
we do not post to walls or make @entity23 information public anywhere or to other @entity12 users , ' creator @entity15 explained			1
once you 've logged on you can see what other women have said about your potential love interests			0
the site does serve other functions too - you can use it to send messages , photos or polls to groups of female @entity41 ( ' @entity42 ' )			2
but that is only likely to take off if people flock to the ' @entity45 '			0
rate after dating : the site 's most interesting - and controversial - feature lets women secretly rate their past conquests @entity50 ? @entity23 lets you describe your first kiss with a former squeeze as ' slobber city ' - or amazing this is internet dating 2.0 - in that the first men that pop up are the ones who are already your friends on @entity12			1
but they will never know that you have rated them , and neither will anyone else			2
some of the ratings do seem a little harsh			0
particularly the ones that invite you to rate your first kiss as ' slobber city ' , or to summarise your sex life as ' all i could could think was ... " is he into girls ? "			0
' but getting an insight into your male friends ' romantic lives - even if you have no interest in bagging them at all - is bound to be popular			2
not fair ? men can not even see their ratings - unless they create a fake facebook profile in which they pretend to be a woman the website , set up by @entity81 entrepreneur @entity15 , 30 , in @entity82 , is already all over twitter			0
@entity85 @entity84 tweeted : ' if @entity86 had signed up to # @entity23 , it would 've saved her a lot of heartache ! ' men are unsurprisingly hankering to join			1
more than 500 boys have already submitted their emails to get access to the site , but instead received an email reading : ' @entity96 , you 're a dude			0
' circle of friends : the site also lets you set up a network of ' bffs ' who you can collectively ask questions , send messages and send photos it is possible for men to get around the ban and see what women are saying about them - with a little dedication			0
they need to set up a fake @entity12 profile as a woman , and make friends with themselves on that social network			1
then , when they log onto @entity23 , their own ratings will pop straight up			1
but they will not be able to see private conversations			0
however , @entity23 has set up a series of strict rules in the backend technology that should prevent any fake @entity12 accounts from accessing the site			1
the site 's first 1,000 legitimate users came from across the globe , with 69 countries represented on the platform			0
the majority were split across the @entity130 , @entity84 and @entity81 .			0
