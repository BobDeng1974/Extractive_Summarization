i 'm 33 and have been single for nearly four years			1
most of my friends hint , imply or say it 's my fault for being too shallow , picky and prone to falling for bad boys			1
i use @entity5 , the dating app synonymous with casual sex , to meet attractive men who meet my high standards			1
@entity10 , 33 , had been single for four years , before she decided to do an experiment where she swiped right to all men on @entity5 for a week it 's a great way of filtering out those you find physically unattractive - just swipe left and they ca n't even message you			1
if you like them you swipe right and , if they feel the same , you can chat			2
most of the time i swipe right to one in 50 - many are too old ( over 35 ) , too young ( under 25 ) , too dull ( into sport ) , too much of a party animal or simply too ugly			2
but , after another friend accused me of being picky , i decided to see what would happen if i swiped right to all men on @entity5 for a week			1
sunday the first day is the worst			2
within a few minutes i 've swiped right to someone with head to foot tattoos , a man with his three children and lots of frowning blokes in their pants			2
after an hour i 'm exhausted , depressed and have opened the flood gates for 80 , mostly unsuitable , suitors			2
monday i get up at 6.30am to swipe right to man who looks like a serial killer , a @entity46 double and a range of football logos ( you can put any image as your profile picture )			0
then a message from @entity5 appears			0
they 've noticed my promiscuous swiping and i ca n't ' like ' another man for another 24 hours			0
why would i want to ? i 've already received 43 matches and seven messages before 9am			1
after the first day of swiping right to all men , the @entity54 - based journalist was met with 43 matches and seven messages , all before 9am tuesday i have messages from 22 men and am chatting to all of them to avoid being ' too picky '			1
the fact they want to talk to me is a revelation			0
i usually have messages from two men a week , tops			1
of the 22 , a couple are lascivious but the majority are from nice , down to earth guys			2
it 's just a shame so few of them can spell			0
i have n't messaged any of them first , either , as i prefer them to do the chasing			0
wednesday it 's only just dawning on me how much admin is involved in being promiscuous			0
keeping 22 different chats going is hard work and confusing , especially when so many men are called @entity78			1
at times i copy and paste the same message to all the guys , which is rude but it 's either that or no reply			0
i ca n't quite believe so many of them are being so polite			0
my normal @entity5 experience , picking only the hot guys , is sleazy pick up lines followed by unsolicited pictures or their penis or even indecent videos			0
maybe i really could find a boyfriend this way after all			0
@entity5 clocked on to @entity10 's promiscuous swiping and sent her a message banning her from ' liking ' anyone else for 24 hours thursday the chats have gone so well that i 've given my number to three men , although i 'm still doubtful about whether i could be physically attracted to them			1
on the one hand , this whole thing feels slightly immoral , or at least an exercise in leading men on			2
but on the other , if i think about my exes , i 'd probably have swiped left to at least a couple as they won me over with charm and humour , not looks			0
friday i 've been asked on three dates - nice dinner dates , not hook ups			1
one guy has outright asked to be my boyfriend			0
another , who is far too young really , has been keeping me entertained with perfect flirty texts			0
i 'm starting to think this is the way forward			0
the 33 - year - old found that attractive men were more likely to message sleazy pick - up lines ( left ) , whereas less attractive men tended to be more polite and seek relationships saturday just because i can , i go back to swiping right on all men again - men with big beards ( yuk ) , men pictured with their much better looking friend and men who think women are attracted to @entity130 screen grabs			1
i also have 69 matches and those dates to prepare for			1
in the end , none of them prove to be @entity137 , but i did have some lovely evenings - good company and intelligent conversation			1
would i do it again ? why not ? some men need a chance to win your heart while others , well , they 're just very bad at choosing profile pics .			2

@entity54 - based journalist , @entity10 , has been single for four years
before the experiment , she had been told by friends that she was too picky
the 33 - year - old went from receiving messages from two men a week , to 22
by the end of the week she had 69 matches and had *scored* three dates
