a man convicted of possessing child pornography , a misbehaving politician seeking re-election and a doctor with bad reviews			0
these are among the flood of people who have already contacted @entity9 demanding that their internet histories be deleted			1
earlier this week @entity12 's highest court ruled people now have the ' right to be forgotten ' , meaning around 500million internet users could have links which tarnish their reputation removed			1
an investigation by @entity18 has found a paedophile has asked for stories about his conviction to be taken down from the site while a politician tried to have pieces about his behaviour in office deleted			0
@entity9 ( pictured ) began removing search results last month and said it has received more than 70,000 requests since it put a form online on may 30 a physician who was unhappy about feedback posted on a review site also tried to have links to the page removed			1
the world 's largest search engine is yet to put a process to handle the expected influx of requests in place after tuesday 's ruling			1
the decision by @entity49 , requires that search services remove information deemed ' inadequate , irrelevant or no longer relevant ' and failure to do so can result in fines			1
' there 's many open questions , ' @entity9 executive chairman @entity54 said at the company 's annual shareholder meeting on wednesday in response to a question about the ruling and its implications on @entity9 's operations			1
' a simple way of understanding what happened here is that you have a collision between a right to be forgotten and a right to know			0
from @entity9 's perspective that 's a balance , ' @entity54 said			2
' @entity9 believes having looked at the decision , which is binding , that the balance that was struck was wrong			2
' he was not asked about the recent take - down requests			0
@entity18 has contacted @entity9 , but the firm has yet to reveal the number of take - down requests it has received			1
@entity9 will need to build up an ' army of removal experts ' in each of the 28 @entity86 countries , including those where @entity9 does not have operations , the source said			1
whether those staffers merely remove controversial links or actually judge the merits of individual take - down requests are among the many questions @entity9 is yet to decide , the source said			1
@entity12 citizens can submit take - down requests directly to @entity98 companies rather than to local authorities or publishers under the ruling			2
if a search engine elects not to remove the link , a person can seek redress from the courts			1
the criteria for determining which take - down requests are legitimate is not completely clear from the decision , said @entity110 , a law professor at the @entity111 and head of the @entity113			2
the ruling was made by the @entity115 ( pictured )			0
it comes after a @entity118 man complained an online auction note about his repossessed home infringed his privacy			0
@entity9 told @entity18 it is ' disappointed ' by the ruling and argued it should not be a censor for data held on websites in its index the ruling seems to give search engines more leeway to dismiss take - down requests for links to webpages about public figures , in which the information is deemed to be of public interest			1
but search engines may err on the side of caution and remove more links than necessary to avoid liability , said @entity110 , a long - time critic of such laws			2
he was asked by @entity9 to speak to reporters on tuesday 's ruling , but has no formal relationship with the company			2
search engines will also have to authenticate requests , he noted , to ensure that the person seeking a link 's removal is actually the one he or she claims to be			2
under the @entity152 , @entity151 includes the ‘ right to be forgotten and to erasure ’			0
under @entity151 17 , people who are mentioned in the data have the right to ‘ obtain from the controller the erasure of personal data relating to them and the abstention from further dissemination of such data			0
' this particularly relates to data about the person when they were a child , when the data is no longer relevant or necessary for the purpose it was collected , the person who owns the content withdraws their consent , the storage period has expired , or if it was gathered @entity86 defines ‘ data controllers ’ as ‘ people or bodies that collect and manage personal data			0
’ the @entity86 @entity180 means any data controller who has been asked to remove data must ‘ take all reasonable steps , including technical measures ' to remove @entity187 a data controller does not take these steps they can be heavily fined			1
@entity9 is the dominant search engine in @entity12 , commanding about 93 percent of the market , according to @entity193 global statistics			1
@entity195 's @entity194 has 2.4 percent and @entity196 has 1.7 percent			0
@entity9 has some experience dealing with take - down requests in its @entity200 video website , which has a process to remove uploads that infringe copyrights			1
@entity9 has automated much of the process with a @entity206 system that automatically scans uploaded videos for particular content that media companies have provided to @entity200			2
@entity9 may be able to create similar technology to address the @entity86 requirements , said @entity213 analyst @entity212			1
even if @entity9 does not automate the process , the extra cost of hiring staffers is likely to be insignificant to a company that generated roughly $ 60 billion in revenue last year , @entity212 said			2
if @entity9 were to pay staffers $ 15 an hour to process take - down requests , for example , the company could get a million hours of work for $ 15 million , he said			1
' it 's the cost of doing business for them			0
' @entity9 has said it is disappointed with the ruling , which it noted differed dramatically from a non-binding opinion by the @entity49 's court adviser last year			2
that opinion said deleting information from search results would interfere with freedom of expression			0
@entity196 is ' carefully reviewing ' the decision to assess the impact for its business and its users , a spokeswoman said in a statement			0
' since our founding almost 20 years ago , we 've supported an open and free internet ; not one shaded by censorship			0
' @entity195 declined to comment			0
@entity246 , founder of @entity247 , told @entity18 : ' the news that search engine operators will be subject to a @entity115 dictat on the right to be forgotten is ludicrous			1
' this ruling advocates nobody being responsible for their own actions			0
@entity257 to press censorship , it 's absolutely wrong that information that is of interest to the general public ought not to be in the public domain			0
you might as well say to a journalist who 's written up a story that they have no right to publish it			0
' the danger is that a public figure can behave as badly as they like , but with no consequences whatsoever , the story effectively becomes buried and forgotten about			0
' there are a minority of cases whereby an individual is associated with unsolicited negative attention due to factually incorrect information on @entity9 and other search engines , but cases such as these should not dictate the lay of the land for everyone			1

search engine firm has already received a flood of requests to remove links
decision by top @entity12 court affects 500 million internet users
requires search services to take down information that could tarnish image
firm is expecting influx of requests and process to deal with them
@entity9 will need to build up an ' army of removal experts ' in each of the 28 @entity86 countries , including those where @entity9 does not have operations
