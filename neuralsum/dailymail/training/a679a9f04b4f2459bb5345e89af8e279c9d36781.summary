by @entity0 published : 08:45 est , 7 february 2014 @entity2 : 10:14 est , 7 february 2014 there 's little better in life than a big fat kiss from someone you love ... right ? well , you might not be so sure once you 've seen this particularly intimate gif of two people playing tonsil hockey ... that was shot from inside one party 's mouth			1
the video , originally loaded onto imgur and @entity15 by user @entity16 and was spotted by @entity18 , shows one mouth diving onto another , but thankfully stalls and repeats before things get any more heated			2
comments beneath the gif on @entity18 ranged from ' could have found someone with cleaner teeth ' , to ' that 's scarring ' and even ' that 's hot '			0
but why are we so repulsed by the sight of something millions of people do every day ? and why particularly when viewed from the lesser - seen angle of inside someone else 's mouth ? @entity35 's resident sexpert @entity34 says it could be to do with the intimacy involved in kissing , but also the intrinsic dirtiness of mouths			1
she said : ' there 's a reason why lots of sex workers wo n't kiss - it seems more intimate than sex for many reasons not least of which because mouths harbour a lot of bacteria ! ' the inside of our mouths and our tongues are n't the prettiest sight and one reason why we think " ewww ! " when the couple next to you on the tube start making out and you get a front row seat of the tongue action			0
