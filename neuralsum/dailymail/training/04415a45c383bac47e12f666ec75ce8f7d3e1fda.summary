but despite having since turned 18 , the attacker will not be publicly named			1
the victim 's family called for the teenager to be tried as an adult , accusing him of being the most violent of the attackers			1
' he should be hanged irrespective of whether he is a juvenile or not			2
he should be punished for what he did to my daughter , ' said the mother of the victim , said soon after the verdict was announced			1
' you may as well set the juvenile free , if the sentence is only three years for heinous offences like rape and murder , ' she added tearfully			2
the mother also said she would appeal against the verdict in a higher court			2
' i am not happy with this judgment			0
at least in this case , the juvenile should have been sentenced to life , ' the victim 's brother told @entity58 news agency			1

@entity131 : the 23 - year - old woman died after being gang raped by six men who also used a metal bar to cause massive internal injuries the sentence is likely to cause further anger in a country attempting to turn a rising tide of violence against women and which has passed a new law toughening sentences for adults convicted of sex crimes the attack set off furious protests across @entity12 about the treatment of women in the country where police say a rape is reported every 20 minutes			1

on july 17 , @entity12 's top court also refused to reduce the age of a juvenile from 18 to 16 years			1
however , it later agreed to hear a new petition seeking to take the ' mental and intellectual maturity ' of the defendant into account and not just age			0

the defendant could only receive a maximum sentence of three years because he was 17 at the time of the attack the teenager , who may not be named , was tried as a juvenile because he was 17 at the time of the attack			1
the maximum penalty that could be imposed by @entity12 's @entity187 was three years			1
in january , authorities ruled he was 17 , citing school records , which shocked the victim 's family and others clamouring for him to face the death penalty			1
in response to the public outcry after the rape , the government fast - tracked tougher laws against sex crimes , but it resisted calls to change the juvenile law and return the adult age to 16 from 18			1
@entity12 's @entity204 is currently hearing a petition filed by @entity206 , an opposition politician and lawyer , that calls for the law to be reinterpreted rather than changed			1
@entity206 wants the ' emotional , intellectual and mental maturity ' of juvenile offenders to be assessed when deciding whether to try them as a juvenile , rather than basing the decision on age alone			0
' i felt that , with the kind of rape that took place , if ( the juvenile suspect ) got off lightly it would send a bad signal to society , ' @entity206 said			0
he plans to launch an appeal against the verdict reached today if the @entity204 rules in favour of his petition later this year			0
the teenager pleaded not guilty to all 13 charges including rape , murder and robbery			0

some 33,000 crimes were committed by juveniles in @entity12 last year , the highest number in a decade , but there has not been a large spike , according to @entity263 figures			2
