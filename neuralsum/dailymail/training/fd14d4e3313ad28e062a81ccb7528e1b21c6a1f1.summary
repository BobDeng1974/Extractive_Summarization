by @entity0 attorney - general @entity1 has had a bad day at the office after delivering a ' train wreck ' of an interview on @entity6 about metadata and the role it will play in the @entity10 's data retention policy			1
during an interview with journalist @entity12 on wednesday , mr @entity1 struggled to outline the government proposal which would require telecommunication companies to keep track of what customers did on phones and the internet			1
this data would be logged for two years and would be used by @entity22 law enforcement , anti-corruption and national security agencies to investigate crimes without a warrant			1
@entity1 struggled to explain to @entity6 ' @entity12 what data the government would be collecting in a new proposal mr @entity1 ’ appearance on @entity6 followed an earlier interview prime minister @entity32 did with @entity34 breakfast show today , where he used a postal analogy to explain metadata			1
‘ it ’s not the content of the letter , it ’s what ’s on the envelope , ’ mr @entity32 said			0
‘ it ’s not what you ’re doing on the internet , it ’s the sites you ’re visiting			0
‘ it ’s not the content , it ’s just where you ’ve been so to speak			0
’ @entity32 appeared on @entity34 earlier to also explain what information the government would be collecting as part of its data retention policy but later the prime minister ’s office told the @entity59 internet browsing history was not metadata			2
to add further confusion - after he was repeatedly asked to clarify what information would actually be captured - mr @entity1 told @entity6 : ' what you 're viewing on the internet is not what we 're interested in ... what the security agencies want to know , to be retained , is the electronic address of the website that the web user is visiting			1
' but then he went onto to admit the data collected under the proposal would include the website			2
after clarification , mr @entity1 explained that the sites visited by a browser would be retained , but not the content that was viewed on the site			0
according to the attorney - general 's office , metadata is ' information that allows a communication to occur ' - including ip addresses within minutes of the attorney - general 's stumble , @entity89 users were relentless in their criticism of mr @entity1 , with @ dfg77 labelling the interview a ' train wreck '			1
' @entity1 has no idea what he ’s talking about on data retention			0
a train wreck of an interview , ' he posted			0
@entity102 chief regulatory officer @entity101 could not hide his feelings either about mr @entity1 ' explanation of his office 's new proposal			2
as mud , ' he tweeted			0
according to the attorney - general department 's data retention proposal , metadata is ' information that allows a communication to occur ' - including ip addresses , the number used to call or text , and time and date of when the communication occurred			1
but metadata does not include ' information relating to a person ’s web browsing or thecontents or substance of their communications ' .			0

the attorney - general appeared on @entity6 to talk about the government 's new proposal
he tried to explain to the journalist what data would be collected under it
mr @entity1 *contradicts* himself throughout the duration of the interview
*social* media users *slammed* his lack of *understanding* of metadata
the data will be used by national security agencies to investigate crimes
