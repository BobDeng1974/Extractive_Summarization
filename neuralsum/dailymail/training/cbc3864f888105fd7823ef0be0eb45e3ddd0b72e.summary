a multiple sclerosis patient is being forced to pay £ 450 a month for a drug which means he can stand up , walk and shower - even though it is prescribed free on the @entity4 in other parts of the country			1
@entity7 , from @entity8 in @entity9 , was diagnosed with @entity10 in 2000 after suffering from symptoms since his mid- 20s			1
constant muscle spasms left the 59 - year - old unable to sleep at night and relying on a stick to walk			1
but mr @entity7 's life was transformed when he found a drug on the internet being used by other sufferers of ms. @entity7 , 59 , has to pay £ 450 a month for drug @entity19 , which helps control the muscle spasms he experiences due to multiple sclerosis , while people in other areas are prescribed the drug on the @entity4 the cannabis - based drug @entity19 controls mr @entity7 's muscle spasms enabling him to walk up and down stairs and get in and out of the shower safely			1
he asked his gp if he could be prescribed @entity32 but was left devastated when the @entity33 ( @entity34 ) , which commissions care for the local area , refused to fund it			1
the former manager at @entity39 said his only option is to pay £ 450 - a - month out of his pension for 11 daily doses of the cannabis - based drug			1
mr @entity7 said the ' postcode lottery ' which gave some patients funding but not others was ' ludicrous '			0
he said : ' it is free in some areas and you can get it willy nilly in @entity52 but my local authority say it is not value for money			1
multiple sclerosis ( @entity10 ) is a condition of the central nervous system			0
in @entity10 , the coating around nerve fibres ( called myelin ) is damaged , causing a range of symptoms			0
more than 100,000 people in the @entity65 have @entity66 usually start in your 20s and 30s and it affects almost three times as many women as men			0
once diagnosed , @entity10 stays with you for life , but treatments and specialists can help you to manage the condition and its symptoms			2
we do n't know the cause and we have n't yet found a cure , but research is progressing fast			0
source : @entity83 @entity65 = ' it is absolutely ludicrous really , they have never looked at the bigger picture			0
' i mean i would n't still be paying for it if it did n't work would i ? ' ' the point i would make is that i am on a postcode lottery for what i can get out of the system but we all have to pay in the same amount			0
' i have paid all my taxes and i just want to get something back out of it			0
it just needs to be a level playing field			0
' i do n't understand because if i was to come off it now i am likely to get worse and cost them more money			0
' mr @entity7 , who lives with his homeopath wife @entity104 , 54 , pays for his supply of @entity32 with his disability living allowance and survives off his @entity39 pension			1
he uses a private prescriptions service to buy the drug from producers @entity110			2
nice guidelines state that @entity32 was not cost - effective as a treatment for @entity10 , but that individual @entity113 could decide whether to prescribe the drugs to individuals			2
last month the @entity4 in @entity52 announced it would fund the medicine , following an appraisal by the @entity118			1
the drug , which is the first cannabis - based medicine to be licensed in the @entity65 , has been used by patients when other treatments prove to be ineffective			0
@entity123 have said that @entity32 , a cannabis - based drug , is not a cost - effective treatment for @entity10 , but they are currently reviewing their guidelines on @entity10 treatment and @entity19 is included in this review @entity130 , senior public affairs officer for the @entity131 said : ' unfortunately @entity133 ’s story is all too common - people with @entity10 are too often subjected to a postcode lottery of access to treatments that could help them better manage the condition			1
' those who are refused treatment by their local health services are forced to pay large sums to private providers or simply go without			2
@entity123 ’s recent recommendation was made within a limited process - we urge @entity123 to conduct a full technology appraisal of @entity32 without delay			2
' a spokesman for the @entity152 , who denied mr @entity7 's funding application , said they may consider handing out @entity32 if it is recommended by @entity123			1
he said : ' @entity123 is currently reviewing its guidelines for the management of multiple sclerosis and is including @entity32 in the scope of the consultation			1
' the guidelines are due for publication in october after which the @entity34 will consider any recommendations			0
' we do not routinely fund @entity32 however patients have the right to be considered for exceptional funding if their gp or consultant feels they meet the criteria			2
' a referral can be made to the @entity34 's exceptional case panel with clinical evidence to support the request			0

@entity7 , 59 , was diagnosed with @entity10 in 2000
muscle spasms left him unable to sleep and needing a stick to walk
@entity19 allowed him to get up , walk and shower again
local @entity152 refused to fund his prescription
he now pays £ 450 a month for a private @entity19 prescription
in other areas like @entity52 , prescriptions for the drug are free on the @entity4
