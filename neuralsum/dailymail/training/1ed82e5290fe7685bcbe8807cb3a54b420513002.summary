by @entity0 for cyclists wanting to maintain their hair , an inflatable collar might be quite appealing			1
but one company claim their airbag helmet is not only a worthwhile fashion accessory - it 's also considerably safer than a regular bike helmet			1
in @entity10 's new video , they outline just why you should stump up the cash for their fancy new collar and throw your old rigid head protector in the bin			1
the @entity31 makers say that many modern bike helmets only just comply with @entity34 regulations			1
but their helmet apparently performed considerably better in testing , making it three times safer than traditional helmets			2
they go on to state that , using their inflatable helmet , the risk of fatal head injuries resulting from accidents can be reduced to almost zero			2
their helmet is so much better , they say , that if the tests were redone with @entity10 as the standard then all other bike helmets would be obsolete			1
one of the graphs in the video shows the chances of serious injury occurring when wearing the inflatable helmet ( left ) compared to a traditional helmet ( right ) in an accident the airbag , designed like a hood , is made of nylon fabric			2
with a traditional cycle helmet in a serious accident , the likelihood of serious head injury is approximately 90 % according to @entity10			1
the risk of a fatal injury can even be as high as 30 %			0
the use of an airbag cycle helmet in the same accident dramatically reduces the risk of injury			2
the risk of serious head injury is then only 2 % and the risk of a fatal injury almost non-existent			2
this means that when it scrapes across the ground it wo n’t rip			0
it also covers a larger area of the head than a regular bike helmet , providing more protection			1
pressure within the helmet stays constant for a few seconds , so it can withstand multiple impacts			0
it is inflated by helium that is held in a holder in the back of the collar			0
one obstacle to this being the gold standard in head protection might be the price , however			0
at £ 299 ( $ 500 ) it 's not exactly cheap and , after it has been inflated once , you ca n't use it again			1
but it might be a small price to pay for cyclists to keep themselves safe on the roads			0
or , at the very least , it 'll provide some amusement for bystanders if it inflates accidentally while you 're cycling along			0
the helmets are stored inside ' stylish ' scarves that come in a variety of colours and patterns			0
the airbag , designed like a hood , is made of nylon fabric			0

@entity31 company @entity10 has *released* a new video of their *‘* *revolutionary* ’ bike helmet for cyclists
their helmet is a collar you wear around your neck
in the event of an accident it will inflate , protecting your head
*sensors* constantly *monitor* movement when it is switched on
they detect changes in *velocity* or angle that indicate an accident
it costs £ 299 and can only be used once
