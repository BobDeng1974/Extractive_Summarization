house speaker @entity0 has been afforded no rest after the passage of the fiscal cliff bill			1
he has been forced to put down a revolt by conservatives furious about the $ 620billion in tax hikes he pushed through the @entity8			0
he has also been subjected to withering criticism from @entity10 in @entity11 and @entity12 - including governor @entity13 - for failing to bring a bill with $ 60billion in @entity15 to a vote			1
president @entity17 , meanwhile , has been vacationing on the sunny beaches of @entity19 - leaving @entity20 just hours after the deal made it through @entity22 on tuesday night			0
the @entity8 released a series of year - end photos of the president on wednesday			0
the first picture in the series was of shot of a jubilant @entity17 frolicking in the warm @entity30 waters			0
@entity0 appears likely to be re-elected as @entity47 when the 113th @entity22 is sworn in at midday on thursday			2
while some conservatives had said that 20 or more @entity50 were prepared to mount a challenge to @entity0 , no one has been willing to step forward as a rallying figure - an indication that the position is in some ways one of the most difficult and thankless in politics			2
@entity0 's job as speaker had been under threat after just 85 members of his @entity10 caucus voted for a fiscal cliff deal that 151 opposed and nearly all @entity64 backed			1
most ominously , his own leadership team publicly split from him over the vote with @entity8 majority leader @entity67 and majority whip @entity68 opposing the bill			1
embattled : @entity12 governor @entity13 said today the @entity0 had refused to take his calls last night over the $ 60bn @entity15 relief bill which is desperately needed in his home state to add to his woes , @entity0 - who faces re-election as speaker on thursday - had been lambasted by @entity12 's governor @entity13 , a potential 2016 presidential candidate , for failing to bring to a vote a $ 60billion relief bill for those affected by @entity15			1
governor @entity13 denounced the ' disappointing and disgusting ' spectacle of fiscal cliff manoeuvrings that showed a ' callous indifference ' for the people of @entity12			1
@entity13 said on wednesday : ' i called the speaker four times last night after 11.20pm and he did not take my calls			2
' but @entity0 was able to placate his @entity50 , most notably the outspoken representative @entity87 , by promising to bring the hurricane relief bill to a vote at the beginning of the new @entity22			2
at one point during the fiscal cliff negotiations , @entity0 had been overheard on the @entity8 floor saying : ' am i having a nightmare , or what ? ' @entity0 took the highly unusual step of voting personally for the @entity98 bill that had passed overwhelmingly in the other house - just as speaker @entity100 was portrayed as doing in the movie @entity102 in voting for the 13th amendment and the end of slavery			1
tough talk : @entity107 voted for the fiscal cliff deal because it was in the interest of the @entity112 people in another indication of a bitterly divided party , the bill pitted another two top @entity10 prospects for the 2016 @entity8 race against each other			1
senator @entity119 of @entity120 voted no and representative @entity107 , the 2012 vice-presidential nominee , voted yes			0
according to @entity10 sources , @entity67 and @entity68 voted against the bill even though they had earlier pressured rank - and - file members to support it , while @entity107 - another so - called @entity10 ' @entity125 - was expected to join them but changed his mind at the last minute			1
@entity107 later said in a statement : ' will the @entity112 people be better off if this law passes relative to the alternative ? ' in the final analysis , the answer is undoubtedly yes			0
i came to @entity22 to make tough decisions - not to run away from them			0
' the influential conservative commentator @entity136 said on @entity137 on tuesday that it was ' possible ' that @entity67 's opposition to the bill ' is the prelude to a challenge thursday ' , when the new @entity22 elected last november convenes			2
@entity136 said : ' it would be naked to do it at this late hour as a result of the split over this vote			0
look , there are a lot of conservatives in the @entity10 caucus in the @entity8 who hate the bill and for good reason			0
' this is a complete surrender on everything			0
the ratio of tax hikes to spending cuts is 40 to 1 , rather than one to one or one to two or one to three			0
so , i mean it 's a complete rout by the @entity64			0
' @entity161 , @entity162 , the former house speaker and 2012 presidential candidate , stated that @entity10 had been engaged in ' a two month dance of defeat and surrender '			0
disaster : boats are seen in a yard , where they washed onto shore during @entity15 , near @entity173 , @entity12 after the storm lashed the @entity175 long road to recovery : @entity178 , left , embraces his wife @entity179 as they survey the remains of the home owned by her parents in @entity184 , @entity11 during @entity15			2
there has been a delay on $ 60bn relief for those affected @entity189 chipped in , also via @entity161 : ' i am a @entity10 ... but the @entity10 may be the worst negotiators in history ! ' multiple accounts of the fiscal cliff negotiations revealed that @entity0 appeared to lose his composure on a number of occasions , most notably when he told senate majority leader @entity192 , the top @entity193 on @entity194 , to ' go f * * * yourself ' during a @entity8 meeting			1
@entity13 's broadside against @entity0 was also notable because he singled out @entity67 as having done his best to bring the @entity15 bill to a vote			1
but @entity67 's apparent attempts to get the fiscal cliff bill passed make him an unlikely rallying figure against @entity0 , at least in the short term			1
@entity210 , a leading conservative figure , used his @entity213 blog to dismiss the votes of @entity67 and @entity68 , saying : ' his was opportunism , not courage			2

@entity67 and @entity68 voted against fiscall cliff bill that @entity0 supported but they will back him in today 's vote
@entity0 had to placate north - eastern *republicans* after @entity12 governor @entity13 said fiscal cliff manoeuvrings showed a ' callous indifference ' to those in his state
