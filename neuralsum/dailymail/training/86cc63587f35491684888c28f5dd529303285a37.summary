not many people manage to steal the spotlight from @entity2 during the @entity3 , but @entity4 managed to upstage his teammate with a well - timed photobomb at @entity7			1
the former world @entity9 crept up behind @entity2 and his wife @entity10 ahead of the official opening ceremony to play the prank while @entity14 's talisman looked ahead none the wiser			1
the relaxed nature of @entity14 's finest should stand them in god stead to retain the trophy when hostilities against the @entity21 resume on friday			1
@entity4 photobombs teammate @entity2 and wife @entity10 ahead of the @entity3 opening ceremony @entity2 acknowledges the support as @entity14 's players are introduced during the opening ceremony when it comes to the competition , @entity2 is renowned as mr @entity3 or @entity29 ( because he always delivers ) as the 38 - year - old seems to grow in stature during the trans - @entity33 battles			1
the @entity35 has been @entity14 's leading points scorer in the last three meetings and was the team 's inspirational talisman who sparked the miracle at @entity41 two years ago			1
for that reason , @entity21 team captain @entity42 has identified him as the statement scalp to chase - a comment that @entity2 regards as a compliment ' as someone that has loved the @entity3 i take @entity42 's comment as a huge compliment , ' said @entity2			1
' i 'm very proud of my record and proud that i 've put a lot of blue on the board			0
' i 'm passionate as a team player to be mentioned with the likes of @entity58 ( @entity59 ) and @entity60 ( @entity61 ) and those players is an absolute honour			0
' i 'm not sure whether i transform ( in a @entity3 ) but i love it and i enjoy what it stands for and i embrace that			2
@entity2 shares a joke with teammate @entity69 during a final practice session before the big event @entity73 1 @entity72 shakes hands with @entity75 after being named partners in the fourballs ' my record in the @entity3 is exceptional and my stroke play record is n't , so quite clearly i 've struggled to take what i have in the @entity3 and put that out for 103 other weeks in between them			1
' it 's hard but ( you have ) to realise that what every putt means in the @entity3 is the equivalent of winning a tournament and the emotion that goes through your body is the same as the putt that you experience on a sunday in a big tournament			2
' potentially , you 're holing lots of winning tournament putts throughout a three - day spell and sometimes that all adds up to more wins than you would ever have in your professional lifetime			0
' @entity2 enters this @entity3 , his fifth , with expectation weighing heavier than ever before on his shoulders , purely on the basis of the role he played in 2012			2
@entity2 comes to life at the competition earning him the nicknames mr @entity3 and @entity29 @entity14 's players celebrate their unlikely comeback victory in the so - called ' @entity110 ' in 2012 it can not be underestimated how significant his run of five birdies in the last five holes to win the saturday afternoon fourballs with @entity72 was with the @entity21 leading 10 - 4 at that point			1
that was both the beginning of the most remarkable comeback in the history of the event and the start of @entity2 's step towards @entity3 greatness			1
as a man not short of self - confidence the @entity35 is happy to carry the burden which will undoubtedly be on him this weekend			2
' i put enough pressure on myself leading in and i work hard to be able to deliver in @entity130 , ' he added			0
' i put more pressure on myself than the millions or billions of people who are out there wanting me to hole putts			0
' i 'm very demanding of what it is i have to do out there and deliver upon and i feel that i can manage that level within myself , because that 's what i expect to do			0
@entity14 's @entity141 laughs off the attention of an enthusiastic fan during practice at @entity7 @entity146 's @entity145 ( @entity147 ) and @entity148 enjoyed themselves in the @entity149 ' from all the previous @entity130 that i 've witnessed , being there from 1993 , i do n't think negatively			1
' i think positively that we are going to go out there and deliver			0
i never feel that i 'm going to go out there and think ' what if something does n't happen ? ' it 's more to the point of ' @entity158 and do the job '			0
' you do n't need to control it			0
you 've been waiting for it for a long time so you just need to grab hold of it and let it go			0
