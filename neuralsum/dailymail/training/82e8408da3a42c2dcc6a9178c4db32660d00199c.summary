adding to the physical toll of playing @entity11 is the heavy cross he carried around @entity7 today , made from two real tree trunks			0

today 's play featured the judgement of @entity11 in front of @entity29 , followed by the journey through the streets of @entity24 wearing the crown of thorns and carrying the cross			2
