invading the vows : the fictional cyborg stands next to the reverend and the couple , both dressed in doctor who - themed outfits as the ceremony gets under way plan : as the ceremony began , @entity20 's brother @entity42 returned to him , pretending he had forgotten the ring ' originally we just wanted to walk down to aisle to the @entity107 but then when @entity108 bought me the @entity17 for my birthday , well , this all happened			1
' the @entity17 was actually an actor in a costume , i do n't think the guests were expecting it			2
