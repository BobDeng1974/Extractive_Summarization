when toned @entity2 stepped out of the sea in his blue trunks in @entity5 , women around the world swooned			1
but while they may admire the actor 's physique as @entity9 , it seems they would n't want to date such a muscular man in real life			0
according to a new study , three quarters of @entity14 women find buff bodies a turn - off and say they prefer their partner to have a bit of flab			1
dr no : @entity14 women say they prefer the body of mr @entity24 actor @entity23 , right , to that of muscular @entity2 as @entity9 similarly , 58 per cent say they would choose a man with love handles over one with a six pack			1
@entity30 women would choose ahead of hunky 007 actor @entity2 include mr @entity24 actor @entity23 , pop star @entity31 and @entity33 star @entity32			1
an overwhelming 96 per cent of women think a dinner date with an abs - obsessed man would be dull			1
almost three quarters - 72 per cent - would rather the date was with a chubbier fella so that they would feel more able to indulge in dessert			1
of those in a relationship , 94 per cent say they love their man just as he is even if he has piled on a few extra pounds			0
again , the vast majority - 91 per cent - of women would rather their man spent ' couple ' time with them than pumped iron			2
almost as many - 82 per cent - would never nag their other half to work out or diet to improve their physique			0
exactly three quarters would rather be hugged by a flabby fella than a gym - hardened muscleman			0
and 74 per cent admit they would feel self - conscious taking their clothes off in front of a perfectly toned man			1
just desserts : many women said they would rather date a man who was n't obsessed with working out so they would n't feel guilty about tucking into pudding nationally , 72 per cent of women have an appetite for an ' @entity68 ' while being turned off by men with muscles			1
but that figure rises to 80 per cent of ladies in the @entity73 and @entity74			0
over three quarters - 77 per cent - of women say their ideal man would not have a chiselled torso like @entity9 actor @entity2 or @entity81 star kit @entity80			1
instead , their dream date - cited by 33 per cent - is more likely to be @entity23 , who memorably emerging from a lake in a wet shirt as @entity86 's dashing mr @entity24			2
next come @entity31 ( 20 per cent ) , @entity32 ( 18 per cent ) , followed by funnyman @entity87 and twilight movie star @entity88 ( each nine per cent )			0
opposite sides of the fence : the survey was carried out to celebrate the release of @entity93 on dvd , which sees beer - bellied @entity95 pitted against toned @entity96 other popular celebrities not renowned for rippling muscles include comic @entity99 , @entity101 's @entity100 and @entity103 ' @entity102			0
only women aged under 25 tend to be attracted to muscly hunks with 49 per cent of them fancying a man with a six pack compared to just 18 per cent of over 55s			0
the survey of 1,000 women was carried out to mark the release on dvd and blu - ray of film @entity93 , which pits buff college boy @entity96 against beer - bellied family man @entity95			2
relationship expert @entity113 , who writes the blog @entity115 for @entity117 commented : ' eye candy is never a bad thing but when it comes to choosing a partner , in reality , buff - bodied men are just not what most women want for real - life partners			2
' most women worry about their bodies , so we know the hard work and dedication that goes into getting a buff , toned body			2
' a man with a perfect body has probably restricted his diet and alcohol intake and spends hours in the gym			0
all this suggests he 's not going to be much fun as a partner			0
' we feel more comfortable with a bit of flab over super toned abs. women are already under extreme pressure to look a certain way and we figure that a man who appears less critical of his own appearance and obsessed with looks will be less critical of ours			1
