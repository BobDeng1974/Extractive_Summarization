by @entity0 published : 11:09 est , 20 march 2013 updated : 13:16 est , 20 march 2013 a @entity2 photographer has been told he can not bring his new bride to the @entity4 and may be forced to leave the country after the @entity6 said he is not a @entity4 citizen			1
@entity8 was born in @entity9 in @entity10 to @entity4 parents but the @entity12 has denied his new wife @entity13 permission to stay in the country , claiming that he ' does not hold settled status '			1
mr @entity8 , who even has a twin brother whose citizenship has never been disputed , is now facing leaving @entity4 over the blunder			1
officials admitted that the bizarre claim was a ' clerical error ' , but insisted that mr @entity8 ’s new wife would have to leave the country in any case because she does not make enough money to stay			1
couple : but @entity8 and @entity13 could be separated after the bride was told she must leave @entity4 mrs @entity29 has been ordered to return to her native @entity30 , and mr @entity8 may have to leave the @entity4 in order to be with her			1
the 31 - year - old was born in @entity9 in @entity10 and was raised in the area , later moving across the @entity35 with @entity36 to @entity37			1
he met his future wife in 2006 when they were working on a cruise ship together , and after a long - distance relationship she moved to @entity4 on a temporary visa in 2010			2
the couple married in @entity44 in july last year , and 29 - year - old mrs @entity29 applied to the @entity6 to become a permanent resident of the @entity4			1
however , @entity12 officials turned down the application , claiming that mr @entity8 ' does not hold settled status , is not a @entity4 citizen and is not a person with refugee leave / humanitarian protection '			1
the letter to the couple came despite the fact that the @entity55 sent in his passport to support his wife 's application			0
identical : but @entity8 , right , was mistakenly told he was not a @entity4 citizen even though his twin brother @entity60 , left , is , as both were born and raised in @entity10 mr @entity8 said : ' my wife and i are extremely upset by how poorly the @entity6 has treated our case			1
it should have been very straightforward as i am a @entity4 citizen			2
' the couple were told they had to launch an official appeal to get the decision overturned - but the appeal was turned down because a @entity12 worker mistakenly told them they had 10 working days to send it in when in fact they only had 10 days			0
' when we called to query this we were told the only thing we could do was to lodge an official appeal against the decision not to allow us to appeal , ' mr @entity8 said			1
' it 's getting beyond a joke now , i dread to think how much this is going to cost the taxpayer to sort out			0
' he added : ' every bit of paperwork they 've sent has been incorrect			0
' mrs @entity29 has been told that if her appeal is unsuccessful she ' must leave the @entity4 as soon as possible ' when her present visa runs out			1
the letter from @entity12 adds : ' if you do not leave the @entity4 voluntarily , you will be removed to @entity30			1
' cutting the cake : a @entity6 blunder initially stopped the couple from appealing against the decision mr @entity8 said : ' i do not have the right to live or work in @entity30 and my worst fear is that we would be separated again , ruining everything we have worked towards			1
' his twin brother @entity60 has never had any problems with his citizenship or right to live in @entity4			2
two of mrs @entity29 's grandparents were @entity4 , meaning that she could have applied for @entity4 citizenship in her own right if she had known about the problems			1
a @entity12 spokesman said : ' the original paperwork sent to ms @entity13 contained a clerical error regarding her husband ’s nationality and we have written to her this week to clarify the situation			1
' we are clear her husband is a @entity4 national and the error did not affect our decision to refuse ms @entity13 ’s application for further leave to remain , which was made because she did not meet the necessary financial requirements			1
' the couple contacted their local mp , @entity124 , and he agreed to write to @entity12 in support of the citizenship application			0
together : the pair met when they were both working on a cruise ship in 2006 the only extended period of time mr @entity8 has spent outside the country came when he worked on a cruise ship where mrs @entity29 was also employed			2
' we were in next - door cabins , ' he said			0
the first time i saw her i thought : ' she looks like fun			0
she also looks trouble ! ' ' we got chatting at crew parties when we were stationed in @entity143 for three months - it was an interesting place for a romance to blossom			0
' he said the couple 's wedding last summer had been ' beautiful ' , adding : ' we 'd like to start a family and build a decent way of life , but that 's pretty much impossible under the current circumstances			0
' mrs @entity29 said she shared her husband 's frustration at the @entity12 's blunders : ' i know they have a backlog of cases , but these mistakes were avoidable and we did nothing wrong			0
' but nobody is reading the paperwork any more			0
and when i asked for an appointment to speak to someone face to face i was told that was n't possible			0
' we are just hoping everything will work out right			0
' partners of @entity4 citizens who wish to apply to remain in the country on the basis of their relationship must meet an array of criteria set out by the @entity12			2
they must prove that they and their other half are both over 18 , that their relationship is ' genuine and subsisting ' , that any marriage or civil partnership is valid under @entity4 law , and that they intend to live with their partner permanently in the @entity4			2
@entity12 also requires proof that would - be @entity4 citizens have met their partner in person , that the couple in question are not related in any way that would prevent them marrying under @entity4 law , and that any previous relationship has permanently broken down			2
financial requirements : @entity191 @entity190 has been told he is not earning enough to keep his @entity193 children with him in the @entity4 following the sudden death of their mother finally the applicant must show that they meet @entity12 's list of ' suitability requirements ' , along with its @entity201 language requirement , and - crucially for @entity29 - its financial requirement			1
this states that any non-national hoping to remain in the country on the grounds that their partner is a @entity4 citizen must have an income of at least £ 18,600			2
if the applicant has a child that is not a citizen or settled in the country that they wish to live with them in the country , the minimum income goes up to £ 22,400			0
each additional child requires an additional income of £ 2,400			0
the @entity12 states on its website that applicants can meet the financial requirement from the employment or self - employment of their sponsor , as well as through their own employment			0
cash savings are also taken into account when applications are being considered , along with any benefits or pension payments the applicant or their sponsor receive in the @entity4			0
last month barman @entity190 , 29 , told how he was facing having his two children taken into care 8,500 miles away after being told he was not earning enough to keep them in the @entity4			1
mr @entity190 brought his son @entity234 , eight and five - year - old daughter @entity235 to live in @entity36 with him following the sudden death of their mother in their native @entity193			0
but despite mr @entity190 holding a @entity4 passport and having another son born in the @entity4 , under new immigration rules cracking down on asylum seekers claiming benefits , @entity234 and @entity235 can not stay here as they must be living in a family earning at least £ 22,500 a year			1
because mr @entity190 brings home only £ 120 a week and his fiancee is on maternity leave , the youngsters will be deported in march and are likely to be taken into care			0
new rules governing the applications of the partners of @entity4 citizens came in on july 8 2012			0
would - be @entity4 citizens who applied before that date were required to prove that they and their sponsor had adequate means to support themselves without relying on state handouts , but no specific minimum income level was set .			2

@entity8 , 31 , lives in @entity37 and married @entity13 , a @entity30 woman
she applied to stay in @entity4 but was initially told her husband was not @entity4
officials later admitted ' clerical error ' but insist @entity13 has to return home
