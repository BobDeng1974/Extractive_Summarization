' @entity4 faces 22 charges , including aiding the enemy , which carries a maximum sentence of life behind bars			1
his trial begins march 6			0
the 25 - year - old intelligence analyst had sought to have the charges thrown out , arguing the conditions were egregious			1
military prosecutors had recommended a seven - day sentence reduction , conceding @entity4 was improperly kept for that length of time on highly restrictive suicide watch , contrary to a psychiatrist 's recommendation			1
@entity9 rejected a defense contention that brig commanders were influenced by higher - ranking @entity14 officials at @entity18 or the @entity53			2
prison cut : any prison sentence @entity4 receives if convicted for allegedly sending reams of classified documents to website @entity7 will be cut by 112 days the judge ruled @entity4 showed no reaction as @entity9 read her decision			1

@entity74 , one of about a dozen @entity4 supporters in the courtroom , said he was disappointed			1
he called the ruling ' very conservative , ' although he said he did n't expect the charges to be thrown out			2

' credit like that becomes much less valuable if the sentence turns out to be 80 years			0

@entity9 ruled on the first day of a scheduled four - day hearing at @entity27 , near @entity98			2
the hearing is partly to determine whether @entity4 's motivation matters			2
prosecutors want the judge to bar the defense from producing evidence at trial regarding his motive for allegedly leaking hundreds of thousands of secret war logs and diplomatic cables			0
they say motive is irrelevant to whether he leaked intelligence , knowing it would be seen by @entity112 manning allegedly told an online confidant - turned - informant that he leaked the material because ' i want people to see the truth ' and ' information should be free			0
' defense attorney @entity120 said on tuesday that barring such evidence would cripple the defense 's ability to argue that @entity4 leaked only information that he believed could n't hurt the @entity94 or help a foreign nation			2
@entity4 has offered to take responsibility for the leaks in a pending plea offer but he still could face trial on charges such as aiding the enemy			1
