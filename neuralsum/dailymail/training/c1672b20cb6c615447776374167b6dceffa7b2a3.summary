by @entity0 published : 11:06 est , 25 june 2012 updated : 19:35 est , 25 june 2012 as historic landmarks go , it hardly ranks as a world heritage site			0
there ’s a simple swathe of grass around the remains of some summer flowerbeds , and the rusty old signpost in the middle has clearly seen service for generations			0
granted , it ’s only a roundabout			2
but for the past 185 years there has always been something rather comforting to the good folk of @entity18 about the island that stands at the entrance to their town			1
protest : dozens of local residents have set up camp on a historic roundabout in @entity18 , @entity27 , in a bid to stop the council replacing it with traffic lights taking a stand : the campaigners , including @entity33 ( pictured ) , are fighting to save the island in the picturesque market town , which has stood for 185 years so much so that when highway planners announced a scheme to get rid of it , they mounted a fearless campaign to save it			1
elderly ladies joined furious traders and young mums to occupy the site on a 24 - hour rota			0
tents were pitched where pelargoniums once bloomed ; demonstrators started a sit - in ( a sit - on , to be technically correct ) ; organisers hoisted a @entity51 and arrived with banners and placards			0
then they vowed that in the matter of the people versus @entity56 – much like traffic at the five - way junction the roundabout commands – the dispute would be going only one way			1
one told the @entity62 the roundabout was as much a part of the market town ’s geography as the memorial clock tower overlooking it			1
another said she would refuse to move until a public inquiry threw out what she described as a ‘ ridiculous , insensitive and unnecessary ’ redevelopment			0
the £ 5million revamp is part of a planning application for a new @entity76 ’s and the ‘ regeneration ’ of the surrounding area			1
the supermarket is paying for the work and the county council has devised a scheme to accommodate it			2
an architect ’s impression of how it would look shows pedestrians strolling in leafy , traffic - free zones and cars waiting obediently at traffic lights – but no roundabout			1
claim : the protesters say the land that the roundabout is built on was bought by @entity95 for £ 100 in 1827 on behalf of the people and therefore can not be developed shift work : more than 60 residents now take it in turns to occupy the roundabout 24 hours a day by sleeping in ten tents which are pitched on the island landmark : the roundabout was originally a meeting place for traders entering the town in the 19th century a council press release trumpets : ‘ the changes will help the town centre cope with expected increases in traffic due to this and other new developments that aim to revive the local economy			1
’ it said the plan would provide better views and improved access to the @entity122 war memorial , the tallest in the country			0
but the proposals have sparked a minor revolution in @entity18 ( motto : @entity127 favente nil desperandum – our skill assisting us , we have no cause for despair )			1
some 1,500 people joined a protest march and more than 1,100 signed a petition to save the roundabout from destruction			1
the council has applied for an eviction notice			2
meanwhile a legal wrangle has been going through the courts after residents claimed the roundabout – originally an island meeting place for 19th century traders – stands on land owned by an ancient trust			1
@entity147 , representing protesters at a county court hearing last week , said the land was bought for £ 100 in 1827			0
council lawyers argued it had been part of a highway since 1879			2
protester @entity153 said : ‘ i think it is absolutely disgusting			0
we ’re standing here doing our democratic right to protest			0
‘ once this is all over , the people that have let this town down			0
are going to absolutely regret messing with the people of @entity18			2

campaigners are fighting to save the traffic island in the picturesque market town of @entity18 , @entity27 , where it has stood for 185 years
local residents set up their camp on the roundabout after the council announced plans to *demolish* it as part of a £ 5million highways project
