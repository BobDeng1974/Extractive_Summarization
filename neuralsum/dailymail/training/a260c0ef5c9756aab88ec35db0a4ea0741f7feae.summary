@entity1 fans are used to seeing the dazzling skills of @entity3 and @entity4 , but manager @entity5 has proved he is no slouch either			2
the 55 - year - old – who played 26 times for @entity9 during his career – completed 73 keepy - uppys in a row as his players warmed up before @entity1 ’s @entity15 clash with @entity16 on wednesday			1
the former @entity18 and @entity19 midfielder looked calm and composed throughout as he showed off his ball skills in training before the @entity15 clash			2
overall their form this season has n’t been perfect though , with the club losing twice in @entity39 to @entity40 and reigning champions @entity41			0
@entity5 has a wealth of options to call upon as @entity1 seek to defend their @entity15 title and win @entity39 for the first time since 2012			0
however , should such form continue or if they suffer an injury crisis then maybe he will have to play himself			0
@entity5 also played for fellow @entity49 side @entity19 during his professional career in the game @entity5 , seen here playing for @entity18 in the 1989 @entity15 final , was a classy act on the pitch the @entity1 boss may have retired from the game long ago but he still has all the skills in his locker			1

@entity5 showed he still has all the skills in his locker as he done 73 keepy - uppys in a *recent* training session
the 55 - year - old was a class act during his playing days for the likes of @entity18 and @entity19 , while also featuring 26 times for his *country* @entity9
@entity5 will be *hoping* to turn around @entity1 *'s* *fortunes* after an *indifferent* start to the season in @entity39
