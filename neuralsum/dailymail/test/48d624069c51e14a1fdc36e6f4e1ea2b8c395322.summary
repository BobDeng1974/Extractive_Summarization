a lawsuit filed by former @entity1 actress @entity1 attempting to have a judge order her kids to return to the @entity4 from their father 's custody in @entity7 has been dismissed once and for all			1
the case was dismissed with a court order stating that it did not have the jurisdiction to force the kids , son @entity13 , 8 , and daughter @entity15 , 5 , to come back to the @entity4			1
@entity17 , 46 , claims her children were illegally deported to @entity7 when a @entity20 awarded custody to her ex-husband @entity22 , 40 , and she pleaded for the order to be reversed			1
@entity22 , who is a @entity38 citizen residing in @entity7 , was deported from the @entity4 over allegations of visa fraud			0
but the dismissal of her case states that @entity17 failed to argue why the federal court should intervene in her custody dispute with @entity22			1
' petitioners allege that the @entity50 state court 's custody order had the effect of deporting the children in violation of their @entity55 right to remain in the @entity4 , ' the document reads			2
the document added : ' there is no authority establishing the unconditional right of minor children to reside in the @entity4 when one of their custodial parents lives abroad			0
' likewise there is no " plainly defined and peremptory duty " requiring respondents to interfere with the custody order - nor is there , as petitioners contend , a general affirmative duty on federal agencies requiring them to intervene against what is claimed to be unconstitutional state action			0
' after divorcing in 2010 , @entity17 and ex-husband @entity22 went through a nasty custody battle which ended with @entity22 being awarded custody while the children were to visit @entity17 on vacations @entity1 left @entity22 in 2009 while she was pregnant with their second child after the @entity38 businessman 's visa was revoked			1
a judge awarded him custody of the children in 2012 further , the court states ' the children have not been deported ; they retain their @entity4 citizenship and , once they reach the age of majority , they will be free to choose where to reside			2
' there is , therefore , no non-frivolous constitutional question , only an attempt to seek federal judicial intervention in a state court custody dispute ' the order affirmed the original order and said it would be improper for the federal court to intervene in @entity17 's custody battle			1
because of this , there will be no intervention and the appeal will be dismissed			0
a @entity50 court ruled two years ago that the children should live in @entity7 with ex-husband @entity107 , who she divorced in 2010 after four years of marriage			1
@entity17 has said that the court in @entity111 , where @entity22 lives , decided on a new custody order that lets her only see her children on holiday and during the summer			2
it has left @entity17 emotionally exhausted , desperate and having filed for bankruptcy with $ 2million in debt after spending all her earnings from @entity1 on legal fees and flights to @entity7 to see her children			0
in it 's dismissal of her case , the court said it failed to argue why the federal court should intervene in the custody dispute @entity129 revealed in august that @entity17 had filed a lawsuit at the @entity131 of the @entity132 in @entity133 on behalf of herself and her children			1
she sued the @entity4 government , including attorney general holder and @entity138 , secretary of the @entity139 , because she claims that an earlier ruling by a @entity142 judge that her children should live in @entity7 was unlawful			2
only federal courts can deal with matters of deportation			0
she wanted the @entity147 in @entity33 court to grant her ‘ temporary emergency authority ’ over her children and an order saying the previous ruling was ‘ unconstitutional ’			0
the @entity4 @entity152 and the @entity139 said on november 24 that @entity17 's case was nothing more than her being dissatisfied with the result of the child - custody proceeding			2
the departments demanded on that her appeal be dismissed and said she 's forcing the departments to become part of something they were never involved in			0
@entity17 argued her case in a @entity33 court on march 18 , but the appeal court shut down her plea and ordered the original order to remain in place .			0

she claims a @entity50 judge deported her children illegally in 2012
@entity50 court ruled @entity17 's ex-husband @entity22 could take the children to live in @entity7 and spend vacations with in the @entity4
her petition to custody battle was dismissed in court last august
but in one final attempt she put in another appeal , which was dismissed
court order states that it did'nt have jurisdiction to force kids to live in @entity4
the *permanent* dismissal says that @entity17 failed to argue why the federal court should intervene in custody case
