by @entity0 next time you hold a secret conversation in a secure room , you might want to make sure there are n’t any crisp packets or plants in the line of sight of a window			0
scientists have found that using a high speed camera , the vibrations of seemingly inanimate objects like these can actually ‘ record ’ sounds in a room			1
the incredible technique can be used to identify music , speech and more just by filming objects and monitoring their tiny vibrations			1
in one experiment the researchers identify words being spoken by filming a crisp packet through soundproof glass ( shown ) the research was carried out at the @entity26 ( @entity26 ) in partnership with @entity38 and @entity39 by @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 and @entity45			1
to reconstruct audio from a video , the frequency of the video samples – - that is the number of frames captured in the video per second - needs to be higher than the frequency of the audio signal			2
audio such as human speech has frequencies of thousands of hertz , meaning that a high speed camera that can record thousands of frames per second is needed to identify the audio			1
in their experiment the researchers used a high - speed camera that captured 2,000 to 6,000 frames per second to identify audio			1
this allowed them to pick out words in speech and hear fairly clearly songs being played			2
however , they also showed that the technique can be replicated using a digital camera			2
these typically shoot video in 60 frames per second so , while their quality could not match that of high speed cameras , ordinary cameras could still pick up some sound			1
this was shown in an experiment where a regular digital camera manages to record the @entity84 song ‘ @entity85 ’ and have smartphone audio recognition software identify the song when it was played back			1
the team developed an algorithm that can reconstruct an audio signal by analysing tiny vibrations of objects			1
for example , in one experiment the scientists were able to recover intelligible speech from the vibrations of a crisp packet filmed from 15 feet ( 4.6 metres ) away through soundproof glass			1
in another experiment , the researchers show how filming the vibrations encountered by a plant ’s leaves enabled them to identify that a song playing nearby was ‘ @entity105 had a little lamb			1
’ ‘ when sound hits an object , it causes the object to vibrate , ’ says @entity40 , a graduate student in electrical engineering and computer science at @entity26 and first author on the new paper			2
‘ the motion of this vibration creates a very subtle visual signal that ’s usually invisible to the naked eye			0
‘ people did n’t realise that this information was there			0
’ the algorithm developed by the researchers is able to analyse the motions of an object as a whole when it 's struck by sound waves			0
as different edges move in different directions , the algorithm aligns all the measurements so that they do n’t cancel each other out			0
the result is that it can then identify signals of different frequencies and play them back			0
this means speech and music can be picked out and identified from the vibrations alone			1
the team used a high speed camera filming at thousands of frames per second and found nanoscale vibrations corresponded to sounds that had been played			1
this meant audio such as music and speech could be identified from video			1
in the above experiment a song was recorded in the vibrations of plant leaves ‘ we ’re scientists , and sometimes we watch these movies , like @entity157 , and we think , “ this is @entity160 theatrics			1
it ’s not possible to do that			0
this is ridiculous , ” ’ says @entity152 , an associate professor of electrical engineering and computer science at the @entity154			0
‘ and suddenly , there you have it			0
this is totally out of some @entity160 thriller			0
‘ you know that the killer has admitted his guilt because there ’s surveillance footage of his potato chip bag vibrating			0
’ while the researchers ’ technique has obvious applications in law enforcement and forensics , @entity40 is also enthusiastic about the possibility of what he describes as a ' new kind of imaging '			2
in ongoing work the researchers are trying to determine the shape and structure of objects from just their visible responses to short bursts of sound			2
‘ we ’re recovering sounds from objects , ’ he says			0
‘ that gives us a lot of information about the sound that ’s going on around the object , but it also gives us a lot of information about the object itself , because different objects are going to respond to sound in different ways			0
’ to clearly reconstruct audio from a video , the frequency of the video samples - that is the number of frames captured in the video per second - needs to be higher than the frequency of the audio signal			2
the song ' @entity105 had a little lamb ' was used in a number of experiments by the researchers			0

research led by the @entity26 has shown that sounds can be identified by monitoring tiny vibrations of objects
team used a high speed camera filming at thousands of frames per second
found nanoscale vibrations corresponded to sounds that had been played
this meant audio such as music and speech could be identified from video
in one experiment the researchers identify words being spoken by filming a crisp packet through soundproof glass
in another they replay a song recorded in the vibrations of plant leaves
and the technique could even be *reversed* to *reveal* the shape and composition of objects by *subjecting* them to bursts of audio
