decades of illegal gold mining has turned vast swaths of @entity3 rainforest in to pocked , mercury - poisoned , desolate wastelands			1
in the south - eastern region of @entity7 , in the past decade alone , mining has stripped 230 square miles of forest and poisoned the rivers			0
it has left the area - a popular site for tourists and home to several tribes living in voluntary isolation - ruined and the lands scarred			0
deforestation accounts for about 40 percent of @entity3 's greenhouse gas emissions and contributes to global warming			1
trees absorb carbon dioxide through their leaves but as there are fewer trees , carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases trap the sun 's heat closer to the atmosphere which leads to the gradual rise in the earth 's temperature			2
the @entity47 country has lost an average of 113,000 hectares of forest every year since 2001 , when 80,000 hectares were destroyed			2
most of the destruction is done by illegal miners from outside the region , though thousands have left in recent months because of a government crackdown			0
illegal mining is the second highest cause of deforestation in @entity3 , after clear - cutting for agriculture			1
the country has vowed to halt deforestation by 2021			0
yet @entity3 's stewardship of its rainforest has been questioned by environmentalists , and deforestation appears to be on the rise			2
the issues were raised at the @entity70 climate conference @entity3 is hosting until december 12			0
@entity3 is more than 60 per cent rainforest and only @entity26 has a larger share of the @entity29 jungle an estimated 333,000 indigenous people live in the @entity3 rainforest - but their livelihoods are at stake because of the decades of illegal gold mining in the region that has destroyed much of the rainforest illegal gold mining has created a deep crater in the @entity7 , which destroys plants and animals a polluted river trickles from the @entity7 area - most of the destruction is done by illegal miners from outside the region the indigenous groups that occupy the @entity3 @entity29 have been hit hard by the deforestation @entity3 's glaciers have lost more than one - fifth of their mass in just three decades higher alpine temperatures are killing off plant and animal species in cloud forests and scientists predict @entity100 fisheries will suffer - indigenous people are also dependent on glacial run - off for hydro - power indigenous groups are often hard hit because they lack formal property title and are marginalised from the political and legal systems , unable to fend off encroachment on their land			1
an estimated 333,000 indigenous people live in the @entity111 and have campaigned with increasing vigour to protect areas that traditionally belong to them			1
in september , four leaders from the @entity117 people were killed while campaigning against deforestation and for land rights .			0

@entity3 is 60 per cent rainforest - only @entity26 has larger share of the @entity29
but it has lost an average of 113,000 hectares of forest annually since 2001
deforestation is caused by illegal mining and clear - cutting for agriculture
*affects* the 333,000 indigenous people who live in the @entity111
also contributes to global warming as there are fewer trees
