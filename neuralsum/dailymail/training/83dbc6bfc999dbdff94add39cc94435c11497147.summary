europeans earn an average of 28 days off every year , according to the @entity34 study eighteen per cent said they allow some of their holiday time to expire due to a lack of money and a further 16 per cent said they forego a holiday because it is too difficult to co-ordinate			1
@entity34 surveyed nearly 8,000 employed adults in 24 countries across @entity11 , @entity1 , @entity12 and @entity103			1
it revealed a sharp disparity in holiday behaviour across continents			0

even though they receive all of that time off , 73 per cent of respondents from @entity108 said they feel ' very or somewhat vacation deprived '			0
@entity118 workers are the most deprived as they receive just 11 days of holiday entitlement , although the study 's true ' winner ' was @entity131 , where people took only seven of 15 available days off			1
eighteen per cent said they allow some of their holiday time to expire as they have limited travel funds @entity138 , managing director of @entity139 , said : ' the vacation deprivation study looks at holiday habits across several different continents			0

' somewhere between 80 and 90 per cent of people worldwide say that holidays make them feel happier , better rested , closer to their family , less stressed , and more relaxed			0
