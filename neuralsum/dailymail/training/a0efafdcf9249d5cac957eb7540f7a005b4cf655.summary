by @entity0 last updated at 1:44 am on 3rd january 2012 with the @entity4 caucuses just hours away , surprise dark horse @entity1 is picking up momentum - and plenty of cash - but the third - place candidate is also looking for help from a higher power			1
the former @entity12 senator , who spent most of the fall and winter at the bottom of polls , surged last week and his campaign has ' raised more money in the last few days than the last few months ’			2
mr @entity1 , who has jumped into third place in the polls , is urging @entity20 voters to ‘ send a shock wave across this country ’ by voting for him and said the @entity21 is searching for an inspirational leader			1
but mr @entity1 is also taking a cue from the last @entity4 winner @entity41 - courting evangelical @entity43 voters that propelled him to victory in 2008 - in an effort to stop mr @entity35			1
mr @entity1 has already picked up support from @entity43 leaders @entity49 and @entity50 , two strong social conservatives who also supported mr @entity41 in 2008			2
he warned voters against choosing a candidate only because they think that person can win and referred to 1980 when @entity55 inspired @entity20 and led the party to victory			1
mr @entity1 added that this is his model for challenging more conventional rivals			2
he also said that he has become the target of increased criticism because his poll numbers have dramatically risen			0
a senior adviser to mr @entity1 told @entity63 that his campaign has raised more money in the last week than online the past six months and fundraising is up to 400 per cent higher daily than ten days ago			2
still top : @entity20 presidential candidate and former massachusetts governor @entity35 was in @entity68 , @entity4 ‘ we have raised more money in the last few days than we have in the last few months , ’ mr @entity1 said , reported @entity63			1
‘ going from zero to 60 in the polls , if you will , will help those resources a lot			0
’ ' lead this country			0
that 's what i ask the people of @entity4			0
lead , do n't defer			0
do n't put forward somebody who is n't good enough to do what is necessary to change this country ' @entity1 riding a late burst of support after spending months as an also - ran candidate , he is trying to convince undecided voters to back his come - from - nowhere movement and pull of an unlikely win			1

going from zero to 60 in the polls , if you will , will help those resources a lot ' @entity1 the preacher was referring to the 1939 film ‘ mr @entity123 goes to @entity124 ’ about a concerned citizen who became a politician , also starring @entity125 and @entity112			2

' i think the gap between ( president @entity155 ’s ) promises and his performance is the largest i ’ve seen , well , since the @entity158 wedding and the promise of " til death do we part " ' @entity35 @entity4 's caucuses will provide momentum for at least three candidates and maybe four - sending them on to the next contests in @entity166 on january 10 and @entity167 on january 21			1
mr @entity35 and @entity102 congressman @entity104 lead the polls in @entity4 , but mr @entity1 is in a battle for third place with mr @entity33 and former house speaker @entity140			1
