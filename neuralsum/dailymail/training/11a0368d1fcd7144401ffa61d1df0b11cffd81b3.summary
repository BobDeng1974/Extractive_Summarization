it may have been the wedding of the year , but @entity1 , who wore three different hairstyles on her fairy tale day , has failed to make @entity5 's best wedding hair of all time			1
the 34 - year - old @entity5 cover star , who wed @entity8 on may 24th with a hairdo inspired by @entity10 in @entity11 , lost out to both modern and timeless brides alike			1

according to @entity48 , the magazine editor said at the @entity49 in @entity50 : ' i think if we just remain deeply tasteful and just put deeply tasteful people on the cover , it would be a rather boring magazine ! ' she added that even from the very beginning , @entity5 was never about pleasing everyone			2
' the first celebrity that i put on the cover of @entity5 was @entity60 , and that was considered completely controversial at the time , too , ' she explained			2

' he continued : ' we did a center part ... it reminded me of @entity10 in @entity11			0
' then i added a small pump of @entity109 at the ends of @entity1 ’s hair to make it look shiny and healthy			0
i really wanted her hair to look as healthy , pretty , and youthful as possible			0
' because of @entity1 's veil , @entity33 tucked her hair behind her ears to keep the look ' simple and elegant			0
the whole look was very modern , chic , and different , ' he explained			0
model @entity118 took a more relaxed approach to the neat knot style popular among many timeless brides @entity123 opted opted for a sleek bun during her church wedding to @entity127 businessman @entity126 , in @entity128 , @entity129 , in 1986 having discovered that she looked best with her hair pulled back off her face @entity131 resolved to stay that way - including on her wedding day to @entity134 @entity135 , @entity135 , called on her hairdresser , the famous @entity137 , to dress her hair every single day			0
