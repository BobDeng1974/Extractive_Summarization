by @entity1 reporter attempts to reintroduce dormice where they had become extinct have failed – because the creatures are too dozy			1
the species , once widespread in @entity6 , declined in the 1950s due to loss of hedgerows and by the 1990s had become extinct in seven counties			1
in an attempt to restore numbers , more than 700 dormice were released at 19 woodland sites from @entity15 to @entity16 by the @entity17 ( @entity17 )			1
@entity18 began to become extinct in the 1950s because of a loss in hedgerows but a review of the 21 - year - old , £ 13,000 - a - year project for government wildlife advisers @entity21 found it was ‘ not an unqualified success ’			1
@entity26 , an ecologist for the @entity17 , said that at five of the sites dormice are probably extinct , at four the species may be extinct and at ten it is too soon to say			1
there were only two sites where the dormice had moved out of the woodland and nested in the neighbouring countryside – a key sign of success			2
one problem is the common or hazel dormouse ( @entity39 ) likes to snooze			2
even when they become active at night they do not venture too far from home			2
mr @entity26 said : ‘ i would n’t call them lazy exactly , it ’s their lifestyle			0
they do n’t go in for too much activity			0
’ other factors blamed were mild winters and predators			0
mr @entity26 said : ‘ between 50 to 70 per cent of dormice die in hibernation			0
they are happy in snow but in mild weather they wake up and use up energy from their stores of fat			0
dormice are also eaten by squirrels and will be taken by cats and owls			0
’ the species was once widespread in the @entity6			0
now , an attempt to re-introduce the animals has been introduced in 19 counties			1

attempt to reintroduce creatures in 19 sites from @entity15 to @entity16
