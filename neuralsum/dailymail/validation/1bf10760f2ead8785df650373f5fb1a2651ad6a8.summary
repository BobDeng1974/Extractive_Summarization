@entity0 received a surprise visit from drug testers prior to his @entity3 with @entity4			1
@entity0 was approached unannounced by an anti-doping examiner at the house he is renting in @entity7 where he is preparing to face @entity4 in @entity8 on may 2			1
both fighters can expect to be tested under the @entity11 programme to which they have both signed up			0
@entity0 was paid a surprise visit by an anti-doping examiner on sunday to take a drug test @entity0 has a plaster applied after giving a blood sample to the examiner @entity0 was visited only four days after the packed red - carpet media event in @entity7 which formally launched the build up to the $ 350million richest fight of all time			1
the inspector called at the house , where @entity0 was relaxing with members of his team between work - outs with master trainer @entity28 at the fabled @entity29 the @entity0 readily complied with tests for both blood – a process about which he had previously expressed his dislike – and urine			1
‘ no problem , ’ he told the medic , with a smile			0
earlier , his promoter @entity38 had made it clear that @entity0 had issued a $ 5m challenge to @entity4 with regard to the testing , and offered to surrender that amount should he fail the examination			1
in addition to the giving blood , @entity0 also gave a urine sample during the test @entity0 and @entity4 can expected to be randomly tested before the bout on may 2 in @entity8 @entity38 explained : ‘ @entity0 proposed that if either of them did not pass a test , that man should pay the other $ 5m			1
‘ @entity4 ’s team declined			2
not because anybody here is afraid of the outcome but because they realised they could legally get a lot more if it happened			0
if @entity4 fails we will be looking for much more compensation than $ 5m			2
' @entity0 has already been paid damages – reportedly in seven figures – after taking legal action for remarks made by members of the @entity4 team , when they began demanding drugs - testing , which inferred that he might have used performance enhancing drugs in the past			1
under the @entity75 procedures , which comply with the @entity77 standards applied for the @entity78 , both boxers must submit to random testing in the weeks leading up to the fight and to another immediately after the event			0
@entity0 was happy to be filmed by a camera crew from the @entity84 , who are documenting the build up @entity0 proposed that if either boxer failed a drug test they would have to pay the other $ 5million @entity0 has had to overcome an element of paranoia that a loss of blood prior to fights might weaken him in the ring			1
but he is so cool about testing now that he allowed video - taping of sunday ’s test by a @entity84 camera crew which is filming virtually his every move between now and fight night in the @entity101			1
@entity4 has campaigned vociferously in the last two years for the implementation of random blood testing for all fights			2
however , with a split purse of up to $ 180m for @entity4 and $ 120m for @entity0 at stake , it seems inconceivable that either man would even remotely risk detection			2
@entity0 has been documenting his training , seen here going fr a road run on the streets of @entity7 @entity4 hits the speed bag as his training camp continues in his @entity8 gym @entity4 vs @entity0 is widely considered to be one of the biggest boxing fights of all - time @entity119 and @entity0 camps exchange verbal blows not all boxers make hundreds of millions of dollars for risking their lives in the ring			1
compared with the most lucrative pickings ever which await @entity4 and @entity0 at the @entity101 in @entity8 on may 2 , our own @entity124 was on a modest stipend when he climbed through the ropes to fight @entity129			2
that @entity130 evening in 1991 ended with @entity124 suffering crippling brain damage			0
it is nothing short of a miracle , made possible by rapid and brilliant medical intervention , that @entity124 has survived to celebrate his 50th birthday , let alone along the way complete a @entity138 in six days with the ever - supportive @entity129 for company			0
@entity124 ( centre ) , pictured fighting @entity129 in 1991 , turned 50 on sunday the bout left @entity124 with crippling brain damage and there will be a fund - raining dinner to celebrate his 50th to celebrate @entity124 ’s half - century , which he turned on sunday , a fund - raising dinner will be held in @entity130 next month to help pay for the constant care he needs			0
the @entity149 will benefit , also			0
@entity150 and @entity151 will be among many star @entity153 boxers in attendance at the @entity155 on @entity156 , april 23 , along with @entity75 legend @entity157			0
tickets , at £ 275 each , are available from @entity159 at @entity160			0
