by @entity0 for the majority of us , slimming down means counting calories and maintaining strict control over what foods you eat and when			2
but now a diet expert has revealed the secret to losing weight might not be calorie counting after all and says that talking to yourself is what really makes a difference			1
dubbed the ' self - chatter diet ' , the unusual eating plan claims to help users beat the bulge by eradicating fattening behaviour			1
slimming solution : according to @entity23 , tackling your behaviour is key to sustained weight loss plan : the diet insists on eating when your body needs it and ending bad behaviour through talking ' there are lots of reasons why people are struggle to lose weight but the main reason is that most weight loss systems are based on restrictive diets , ' explains the man behind the plan , diet expert and hypnotherapist @entity23			1
' until obesity is accurately diagnosed and is re-labelled as a behavioural condition - and is therefore treated as such - no solution will ever be found			2
' it 's not food that makes us overweight but way in which food is eaten			2
beliefs , behaviours and associations are the fundamental reasons for the obesity epidemic			2
' @entity54 of @entity23 's hit list are eating by the clock , assuming that all three main meals have to be eaten and seeing sugar and fat laden foods are a treat			1
' treating being overweight with restrictive diets is no different to treating a broken leg with a painkiller , ' he adds			2
' for someone to achieve their ideal weight , the only way is to identify , question , challenge and change the detrimental behaviours responsible			0
' to do this , @entity23 has devised a system which he dubs the ' self - chatter ' diet which involves being aware of bad behaviours - and telling yourself off when you try and do them			1
' self - chatter is your inner - voice and often , this self - talk happens so automatically you are barely aware of it , ' he explains			0
' however , what you say to yourself can have a profound effect on the way that you feel and what you can achieve			0
' all natural : along with talking your way out of bad behaviour , @entity23 says natural eating is the way forward in the case of weight loss , that means being aware of the behaviours that lead to weight gain , for instance raiding the fridge at midnight or insisting on a late dinner , and stop yourself before you do it			1
' with time and effort , and by following the body ’s hunger and satiety signals as opposed to environmental cues , you 'll reignite natural instinctive eating habits , ' adds @entity23			1
' as a consequence , eating smaller portions and consuming less will become a normal practice			0
' but while talking to yourself is one thing , even @entity23 admits that self - chatter wo n't do much for you if you still fill up on junk food			1
' you need to give your body more fresh , natural food and plenty of water , ' he adds			0
' eating in moderation , choosing nutritious food and being vigilant about what you eat will all help			0
' do n't , he adds , expect the weight to drop off overnight			0
' a no effort , easy to achieve weight loss system is still yet to be found and probably never will be , ' @entity23 explains			1
' any system that promises a no effort , easy to achieve , solution to being overweight is a manipulative one and not true			0
' the only way to lose weight is to take responsibility for it yourself			0
the road to weight - loss success is n't easy but it 's something that everyone can achieve and that is a fact			0
