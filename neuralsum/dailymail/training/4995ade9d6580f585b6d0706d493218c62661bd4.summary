by @entity0 published : 19:16 est , 17 december 2012 updated : 21:13 est , 17 december 2012 gender gap : working mothers earn 21 % less than men the report says , while the cost of childcare can almost wipe out the benefit of returning to work mothers who work full - time earn 21 per cent less than men , a report revealed yesterday			1
but even women without children are victims of @entity17 ’s gender pay gap			1
on average , they earn 7 per cent less than men in full - time jobs , the @entity18 said			1
‘ women pay a high price for motherhood , ’ the leading international think - tank warned			2
it also pointed to the crippling cost of childcare in @entity17 , which can almost wipe out the benefit of a mother returning to work			2
the study looked at the gender gap in pay between men and women who are 25 to 44 , the typical age at which parents are having and raising young children			1
in the @entity17 , the pay gap between men and women with a full - time job triples from 7 per cent before starting a family to 21 per cent once a woman has children			1
the @entity18 report follows a recent study that found the average woman in a senior role will earn £ 425,000 less during her career than a man doing the same job			0
women are also less likely to get a bonus and more likely to be made redundant , the @entity50 said			0
the @entity18 report said the cost of childcare is so high in @entity17 that it eats up nearly half the salary of a parent earning a lower wage			2
this is much higher than in most other countries – in @entity60 it is 7 per cent , in @entity61 12 per cent and in @entity62 23 per cent			2
to add to the pressure on @entity17 families , more than two - thirds of the salary that is left after paying for childcare is ‘ effectively taxed away ’			1
this is ‘ well above ’ the 52 per cent average among the 34 countries in the @entity18			0
according to the @entity72 , it costs an average of £ 206 to put a child under two into a nursery for 50 hours a week in @entity76 , an increase of more than a third in the past seven years			0
warning : @entity72 chief executive @entity78 has said the childcare system is in need of major reform @entity78 , chief executive of @entity72 , said : ‘ some families are no better off when the mother returns to work after maternity leave			0
ministers say that work should always pay and they are changing the benefits system to make this happen			0
‘ but the childcare system also needs major reform as the cost is forcing parents to turn down jobs or end up in hardship			0

study reveals the true *extent* of the gender pay gap in @entity17
