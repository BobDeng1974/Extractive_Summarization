by @entity0 it was hoped that a new road unveiled in the @entity3 that could change the way we drive in the future			1
glow - in - the - dark paint was deployed on a 0.3 - mile ( 500 metres ) section of the @entity11 road near @entity12 , @entity3 but the ‘ smart highway ’ has experienced teething problems			1
the markings have ‘ faded out ’ and have been found to be highly sensitive to large amounts of moisture – which could prove a frequent problem in rainy northern @entity19			0
the technology was first unveiled in 2012 when it scooped ‘ @entity43 ’ at the @entity44 and has been dubbed a green solution to lighting our roads			2
using ‘ photo - lumising ’ powder , the paint absorbs sunlight in the day and releases it at night for up to 10 hours , providing drivers with clear markings on where to go – or that is the plan			1
engineers are working on honing the idea after reports from drivers that markings are not as clear as they should be			0
the stretch of road near @entity12 is not glowing as brightly as was hoped as it has been found that moisture affects the glow - in - the - dark paint , pictured here glowing at optimum levels civil engineering firm @entity62 , which is in charge of the project , told @entity66 that the markings are sensitive to rainfall and consequently are not giving out a consistent amount of light			1
‘ as expected the “ real life ” trial enables us to learn from the environment and users , ’ the firm said in a statement			0
‘ we will use these insights to introduce an update to the @entity80 2.0 version			2
in the meantime we have temporarily faded out the lining to prevent any confusing situations for road users			0
‘ as planned we are working on developing @entity80 version 2.0 , which will be ready for this summer			1
it will then be introduced on a larger scale in the @entity3 and abroad			0
’ the technology is currently being tested on a 0.3 - mile ( 500 metres ) stretch of the @entity11 near @entity12 the @entity91 @entity90 said it is watching the trial but that previous studies have shown that using glow - in - the - dark paint is unsuitable for the @entity91			1
@entity96 refuses to let the water issue dampen its hopes that ultimately the paint could be used to make interactive roads			2
for example , weather symbols could be painted on the road that appear when the temperature reaches a certain level			0
despite teething problems , it is hoped that the powder technology within the paint could be used to make road markings that change according to the temperature , giving drivers live weather reports that could warn them of icy roads @entity22 's plans for interactive roads also include lanes where electric cars could be charged there are also plans for other functionality including priority lanes that indicate when and where cars should change lanes			1
‘ innovative designs such as the @entity126 , @entity127 , @entity128 , @entity129 and @entity130 will be realised within … five years , ’ the companies recently said			0
‘ the goal is to make roads that are more sustainable and interactive by using interactive lights , smart energy and road signs that adapt to specific traffic situations			2
’ dynamic lines could be used to tell you when you can overtake and when you should stay in lane			0

@entity22 ’s technology uses ' photo - *luminising* ' powder and is being tested on a road near @entity12 in the @entity3
lines containing the powder are painted along the side of roads but are sensitive to rainfall and are not giving out a consistent amount of light
@entity152 absorbs daylight and then releases it for up to 10 hours at night
engineering firm says it will develop @entity80 version 2.0
technology could still be used to build interactive roads in the future
