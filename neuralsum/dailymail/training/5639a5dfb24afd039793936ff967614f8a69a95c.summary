stare up at the moon and you might be forgiven for thinking that it ’s a barren , desolate world that does little more than orbit earth			0
but research suggests that our planet ’s natural satellite is not a lifeless hunk of rock - it ’s actually got a hot liquid layer around its core that is still churning today			1
if true , the study would suggest the moon is more active than once thought , and it would also have important implications for the history of @entity3			1
researchers in @entity17 have presented evidence that part of the moon is still liquid			1
they say @entity3 's gravity is keeping a molten layer around the moon 's core ( illustration shown )			1
the conclusion is based on seismic experiments from the @entity29 mission and also information from @entity33 's @entity32 lunar orbiter it has proven for the first time that the deepest part of the lunar mantle is soft , based upon the agreement between observation results and the theoretical calculations			1
the research team also clarified that heat is efficiently generated by the tides in the soft part , deepest in the mantle			0
in general , a part of the energy stored inside a celestial body by tidal forces ( caused by being pushed and pulled by its partner , in this case @entity3 , as it orbits ) is changed to heat			2
the heat generation depends on the softness of the interior			0
whereas previous research also suggests that some part of the energy inside the moon due to the tidal forces is changed to heat , the present research indicates that this type of energy conversion does not uniformly occur in the entire moon , but only intensively in a soft layer			1
the research team believes that the soft layer is now warming the core of the moon as the core seems to be wrapped by the layer , which is located in the deepest part of the mantle , and which efficiently generates heat			1
they also expect that a soft layer like this may efficiently have warmed the core in the past as well			2
any two bodies in orbit in space have a gravitational effect on one another , but as no orbit is perfectly circular , the force of gravity varies as they move closer and further from one another			0
the effect is very noticeable on moons such as @entity92 ’s @entity91 , where volcanoes rage on its surface as it swings round its parent planet in an elliptical orbit and is pushed and pulled by the planet ’s gravity			0
and the effects are apparent here , too , on @entity3 , where the seas and oceans undergo daily tides due to the gravity of the moon			1
of course , given that our planet is 81 times larger than the moon , it ’s obvious that in turn the moon would experience similar forces as it orbits			0
it had previously been considered that this might cause part of the moon ’s core to be liquid , just as how @entity3 ’s core is liquid , but until now no one had shown this could be true			1
now an international research team , led by dr @entity121 from @entity122 , @entity123 , has found that there is an extremely soft layer deep inside the moon and that heat is effectively generated in the layer by the gravity of @entity3			1
the discovery was made by comparing the deformation of the moon as precisely measured by @entity134 's @entity133 ) spacecraft and other probes with theoretical calculations			2
the findings suggest that the interior of the moon has not yet cooled and hardened , and also that it is still being warmed by the effect that @entity3 has on the moon			1
researchers say the findings provide a chance to reconsider how both @entity3 and the moon evolved - and continues to evolve - since their births through mutual influence			1
any two bodies in orbit have a gravitational effect on each other , but as no orbit is perfectly circular the force of gravity varies as they move closer and further			0
this effect causes a pushing and pulling effect , noticeable by @entity3 's tides			1
an exaggerated diagram of this effect on the moon is shown this is an estimate value of the @entity164 ’s interior viscosity structure replicated with the observational results in this research			0
the viscosity is one indicator of how tender or hard the moon 's interior is			1
for reference , the density structure and seismic velocity based on previous studies are added ‘ i believe that our research results have brought about new questions , ’ said dr @entity121			0
‘ for example , how can the bottom of the lunar mantle maintain its softer state for a long time ? ‘ to answer this question , we would like to further investigate the internal structure and heat - generating mechanism inside the moon in detail			0
‘ in addition , another question has come up : how has the conversion from the tidal energy to the heat energy in the soft layer affected the motion of the moon relative to @entity3 , and also the cooling of the moon ? ‘ we would like to resolve those problems as well so that we can thoroughly understand how the moon was born and has evolved			2
’ the research team focused on the structure deep inside the moon			0
during the @entity29 programme , seismic observations were carried out on the moon			2
analysis of data concerning the internal structure of the moon indicates that the satellite is considered to consist mainly of two parts : the ‘ core ’ - the inner portion made up of metal - and the ‘ mantle ’ , the outer portion made up of rock			0
researchers found that the observed tidal deformation of the moon can be explained if there was an extremely soft layer in the deepest part of the lunar mantle			1
previous studies have indicated that a part of the rock at the deepest part inside the lunar mantle may be molten			2
these results support the above possibility since partially molten rock is soft			0
here @entity232 is shown with a seismic experiment during the @entity235 mission in july 1969			0
experiments such as these provided the researchers with information they could use to prove that part of the moon 's core is still hot and molten another investigator , professor @entity243 of the @entity244 at @entity134 , mentioned the significance of this research			1
' a smaller celestial body like the moon cools faster than a larger one like the @entity3 does , ' he said			2
' in fact , we had thought that volcanic activities on the moon had already come to a halt			0
therefore , the @entity164 had been believed to be cool and hard , even in its deeper parts			0
' however , this research tells us that the @entity164 has not yet cooled and hardened , but is still warm			0
' it even implies that we have to reconsider the question as follows : how have @entity3 and the moon influenced each other since their births ? ' that means this research not only shows us the actual state of the deep interior of the moon , but also gives us a clue for learning about the history of the system including both @entity3 and the moon			2

researchers in @entity17 present evidence that part of the moon is liquid
they say @entity3 's gravity is keeping a molten layer around the moon 's core
the conclusion is based on seismic experiments from the @entity29 missions and also information from @entity33 's @entity32 lunar orbiter
suggests the moon 's core has not cooled and is still churning
it could provide information on the history of the @entity296
