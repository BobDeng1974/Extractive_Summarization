from @entity4 the psychic octopus to @entity2 the sea turtle , the bookies are no stranger to calling in animals to help with working out the odds			0
now one is hoping a pack of corgis will give betting on the royal birth a boost , while giving the public a clue to the sex and name of the new fourth - in - line			2
the ' @entity16 saw 10 dogs face off in race across @entity20 's @entity19 , with a pooch named @entity22 taking first place			1
a dog called @entity22 , a name that is currently running third in the betting , took the honours followed by @entity43 ( 100/1 ) and @entity44 ( 10/1 )			1
among the boys , @entity45 came first , despite boasting real - life odds of just 25/1 , followed by @entity48 ( 8/1 ) and @entity49 ( 200/1 )			0
' @entity26 romped to victory and it looks like @entity52 will soon be giving birth to a little girl next month , ' said @entity34 ' @entity55 , tongue firmly in cheek			0
prediction : the race was a tongue - in - cheek attempt to predict the name and sex of the new royal baby ready for action : the pets were put through their paces in a tiny parade ring beforehand and they 're off ! the dogs emerge from the traps with @entity45 ( fourth from left ) taking an early lead sprinting ahead : the pets are on their way , although @entity49 ( left ) does n't seem too bothered ' royal baby betting is booming and the arrival of a new heir to the throne is sure to see a record amount of wagers placed			1

although corgi @entity87 rolled home last in the @entity28 , the name is currently the odds - on favourite should the @entity91 and @entity52 have a girl			2
other popular choices include @entity94 , the second - favourite at 6/1 , and @entity96 which comes in at 12/1			1
streaking ahead : a sprinting @entity22 leaves the competition trailing in her wake well ahead : @entity22 charges down the final furlong followed by second - placed @entity43 good work : @entity26 enjoys her trophy and a special rendition of the @entity85 should the new royal baby prove to be a boy , it is @entity48 that is the hot favourite followed by @entity108 , @entity109 , @entity110 and @entity111			1
while the majority of names put forward by punters are sensible , others have had a flutter on more outlandish names , according to @entity55			0
' @entity87 and @entity48 are currently the most popular girl and boy ’s names , ' she explains			2
