by @entity0 the @entity3 government 's latest attempt to stop illegal immigrants crossing the border comes via the radio			1
as part of a new multi-million dollar ' @entity10 ' , the @entity8 campaign commissioned a catchy @entity13 song to be written and produced to discourage families in @entity15 , @entity16 , and @entity17 from sending their children with smugglers to cross the @entity3 border through @entity21			1
that song - @entity22 - has subsequently become a major radio hit in @entity24 , with its legion of fans unaware it was created to ' teach ' them something			1
@entity22 - translated as ' @entity29 ' - refers to the notoriously dangerous freight train that migrants ride from @entity21 - risking robbery , kidnapping , rape , and murder - just to make it to the @entity3 border , reports the @entity37			1
unaccompanied minors ride atop the wagon of a freight train , known as @entity22 ( @entity29 ) in @entity41 , in the @entity21 state of @entity43			1
a new song widely circulated on @entity24 radio about the train was created by the @entity3 government to subliminally dissuade migrants from crossing the border hundreds of thousands of migrants , mostly @entity24 , risk robbery , death from fast - moving freight trains or dehydration in the desert while trying to reach the @entity3 illegally @entity24 migrants rest next to the train tracks while waiting for the freight train ' @entity22 ' , or @entity29 , to travel to north @entity21 to reach and cross the @entity3 border the track features lyrics such as : ' migrants from everywhere , entrenched along the rail ties			1
' far away from where they come , further away from where they go			0
' they call her the @entity29 from the @entity66 , this wretched train of death			2
' with the devil in the boiler , whistles , roars , twists and turns			0
' the vocals are by @entity75 - a wedding and @entity78 singer - in @entity13			2
the beat features a @entity81 flavor			0
the song is just one part of the ' @entity10 ' assault , with billboards and other public service announcements , such as television advertisements , to be rolled out as well			0
@entity22 was the brainchild of @entity89 , the creative director of @entity91 advertising agency @entity90			0
the song is part of a new multimillion dollar campaign by @entity8 to discourage migrants from dangerously trying to enter the country what makes the tune somewhat propagandist is that it is played on regular rotation by radio stations without a disclaimer			2
this means listeners have no idea it was tailored specifically to them by @entity8			2
however those leading the campaign this an important detail			0
they said people would not be open to the message otherwise .			0
