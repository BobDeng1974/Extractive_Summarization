@entity1 race goers will no doubt be reaching for the @entity2 and nursing sore heads this morning as the hangover sets in after a long day of celebrations across the nation			1
at this year â€™s race that stops a nation , more than 100,000 punters flocked through the gates at @entity12 in @entity13 , for a day of horse racing fun , which for some , was just an excuse to take a day off work , dress the part and enjoy with friends			2
punters also packed out other prominent racing venues around the country , including @entity22 's @entity21 and @entity24 's @entity23			0
while thousands more around the country enjoyed countless lunches , parties and glamorous functions to get in the spirit of @entity31 's biggest horse race			0
but as the day went on , so did the shenanigans , leaving some punters a little worse for wear			2
some opted to ditch the heels and go bare foot , while others ripped off their ties or used the floor as a seat and thank goodness for the trusty old picnic rug where a number of race goers ended up taking a snooze to sleep off a hard day			1
@entity50 police were relatively pleased with behaviour , praising @entity1 crowds , with only two people arrested and ten evicted for boozy bad behaviour			1
police said they were all for alcohol - related matters			0
' they have celebrated really safely and we have had no serious incidents reported to us , ' superintendent @entity56 told @entity60			0
