by @entity0 follow @ @ lauriewhitwell @entity1 sits in a sunlit meeting room at @entity3 ’ training ground explaining how his genial manner hides a clinical disposition			1
he may be nice , but he can wield a knife			1
this summer , as he plots a path for the club ’s return to the @entity11 , he has once again sliced eight players ( earning a total of around £ 7million a year ) from his squad , telling them their services will not be needed			1
that group , who are training separately from the first team and will not feature in pre-season games , includes @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22 — players with top - flight experience on seven - figure wages			1
it is a hardline stance but @entity1 , entering his 11th consecutive year in football management , knows there can be no softening of a policy that rid the club of the toxic atmosphere caused by successive relegations and gives his team a better chance of success on the field too			1
‘ it was our ambition to only spend one year in @entity44			1
some big clubs have stayed down for two , three , four years — both @entity70 clubs , @entity71 , @entity72			1
‘ i ’ve seen when it ’s two - and - a - half years before all those big contracts run out and you get a group of hungry young lads that nobody ’s ever heard of coming through			1
they see the fantastic potential , the big crowds , and want to make a name for themselves			1
‘ what i tried to do was accelerate that process			1
we could n’t drift along			1
we needed to have that type of turnover in one summer			1
i had the benefit of being a rival manager coming to @entity89			1
i felt the relationship between the crowd and players had broken down			1
those players needed to be removed			1
it ’s not a patient industry i ’m in			1
’ as if to remind , a painting of a pack of wolves hangs on the wall			2
@entity101 words can be delivered humanely , however			2
‘ i just tried to be as clear as i could that they were n’t in my plans , ’ @entity1 , 52 , continues			2
‘ also , i felt they would benefit from a move			2
there were a lot of people who ’d spent a few years in the @entity11 and it ’s quite hard to then come down			2
’ he adds : ‘ as manager your successful times are when you are being proactive			1
in many cases you have to make the calls before the mistakes happen			2
after that , on a human level , the one thing you need to be is straight with people , to be open and honest			2
’ top of the league : @entity120 celebrates scoring as @entity3 went to the summit of the third tier so it came to pass that only two members of the side who featured in the defeat at @entity128 on the final day of the 2012 - 13 season — a result that underlined relegation for @entity3 and saw angry exchanges between fans and players — appeared in the 6 - 4 win over @entity136 in april that celebrated immediate promotion back			2
the crowd was raucous that day , too			2
homegrown players such as @entity140 , 23 , and @entity141 , 21 , blossomed , while signings @entity143 , 22 , and @entity144 , 25 , proved instant hits			1
@entity146 and @entity147 are the duo providing continuity			2
wolves clinched the @entity44 title with a record 103 points as @entity1 implemented an attractive passing game			0
win or lose , players recognised fans with applause			0
it was n’t just a bloated squad @entity1 trimmed for gains			0
the training ground canteen menu had swollen from players pushing their individual tastes			0
choices now are fewer and healthier but there is no @entity167 - style ban on tomato ketchup			0
fading fast : @entity169 and @entity20 have been training on their own during this pre-season confidence in youth : @entity1 wants to build his side around the likes of @entity140 pedigree : @entity144 blossomed at @entity89 after @entity1 landed the former @entity178 man ‘ i felt the menu was catering to too many different opinions that were n’t the experts , ’ says @entity1			1
‘ we employ a full - time sports scientist			0
his job is to dictate the menu , what is eaten , when and why			0
’ if last season ’s goals were clear — right wrongs , lift the mood , gain promotion — this season presents a more complex landscape			0
but @entity1 has one vision			0
‘ it again is to try and go up , ’ he says without hesitation			0
‘ three lucky teams will get into the @entity11 by the end of this championship season			0
we want to be one of them			0
@entity3 are big enough to be competing			0
’ @entity1 is wise in the ways of promotion			0
as a member of @entity206 ’s @entity49 side of the 1980s he reached the @entity208 final and was capped 31 times by @entity210 before retiring aged 28 after knee injuries , going into coaching early			0
confrontation : @entity3 supporters were upset with @entity20 and @entity22 after relegation in 2013 in the late 1990s , as assistant to @entity206 , he saw @entity49 into the @entity11 after successive promotions then , as no 2 to @entity217 , helped @entity218 go up from what is now @entity44			1
as manager , he took @entity221 from the bottom rung as they began their ascent up the leagues , while @entity178 reached the @entity45 under his guidance			1
wolves , though , is a chance to show his teeth			0
‘ do i hope there are many more opportunities for me in the future ? yes			0
i suppose that will be dictated by how well i do at @entity3			0
i ’m fully aware of the insecurities of football management			0
‘ i ’d love to manage in the @entity11 , i ’d love to perhaps manage at international level			0
it is my ambition to go as high as i can			0
’ do not discount the steel behind the smile .			0

manager has opted for *youngsters* instead of @entity169 and @entity20
@entity22 has also been left out in the cold
@entity140 and @entity144 have impressed at @entity89
