dressing the boys up in adorable @entity7 suits , the couple shared from the @entity27 in @entity28 , @entity29 , on their blog , while speaking of their excitement for christmas 2014			1
their sons are due for another bout of surgery early next year and , if successful , could be home by summer			1
@entity7 's little fighters : formerly conjoined twins @entity9 and @entity5 - who continue to progress and recover from their separation surgery - may have spent their first @entity6 in hospital in @entity28 , but did n't miss any of the celebrations the @entity5 family have a lot to be thankful for this @entity6 after their sons , @entity9 and @entity10 , were born conjoined in july but successfully separated in august following another bout of surgery early next year , @entity22 and @entity43 are hoping to take their boys @entity9 and @entity10 home by summer 2014 @entity49 and her husband @entity50 , from @entity51 , @entity52 , were told during a routine sonogram earlier this year that their babies were joined at the abdomen next @entity6 is going to be bedlam , ' @entity43 told @entity58 with a smile			1
' it 's going to be madness with all those little ones running around			0
' ' it 's going to be great though			0
bedlam in a good way			0
' @entity9 is currently 16 lbs. , while @entity10 is 15 lbs. @entity27 says the boys are alert , smiling and interacting with their family and @entity27 staff			1
' we 're getting these rumblings that the boys are getting better and it 's not long before we get to bring them home and you know , it 's all worth it , ' @entity20 said			2
' at this point we 're as glad as we can be to have gone through it because now we 're here			0
' these comments are at complete odds with the situation they were in back in march , after finding out while pregnant their twins shared vital organs only had a five per cent chance of living a healthy life if separated			2
the heartbroken parents considered a termination			2
successful : this photo shows one of the twins shortly after the 11 - hour operation which successfully separated them in august we wanted to save them from the pain and hurt that they would feel , ' mr @entity5 said at the time			1
however the couple soon had a change of heart after a doctor convinced them that their boys , who shared a liver and intestines , had a fighting chance			1
a specialist at @entity109 renewed their faith , telling them : ' these boys have a really good chance			2
this is not your only option			0
' mrs @entity49 gave birth to conjoined boys @entity10 and @entity9 on july 15			1
doctors advised that separation surgery was possible but risky - out of eight similar operations , only once did both twins survive			1
the couple , who have two other sons , moved to @entity28 for the boys ' medical care and were able to say goodbye before the boys were taken into surgery			1
' as a mother , i hope i never have to experience a moment like that again , ' mrs @entity49 wrote in her ' @entity134 ' blog			0
brothers : conjoined twins @entity9 and @entity5 , pictured before their separation , continue to recover and get stronger , doctors say brotherly love : @entity140 watches as her eldest son @entity141 comforts his little brothers @entity9 and @entity10 , who shared a liver and some of their digestive system on august 24 , an 11 - hour operation successfully separated the boys			1
at a news conference following the surgery , mrs @entity49 said : ' i have two babies â € ¦ two separate babies ! ' her husband added : ' a couple of pretty good looking babies , @entity153 € ™ d say			2
' @entity9 and @entity10 , have remained at @entity27 in @entity28 since they were born and will do so for several more months			1
they will need further surgeries in the future ; after they are two , the boys will require ' skin expanders ' for their wounds			2
another operation will require surgeons to pull abdominal muscles into place , which should leave them with only a neat line of a scar			0
after this , if the parents wish , they can opt for the boys to have a third surgery to create a belly button for each of them			1
@entity173 : an ultrasound shows the boys attached at the abdomen while in @entity178 's womb early days : the babies shortly after their birth on july 15 roughly one out of every 200,000 live births worldwide results in conjoined twins , according to the @entity184			0
around 40 to 60 per cent of conjoined twins arrive stillborn , and about 35 per cent survive only one day			0
the survival rate is between 5 per cent and 25 per cent , the @entity186 reported			0
the condition is three times more likely to occur among females than males and a third of conjoined twins are attached at the lower chest , sharing organs			0
chances of successful surgery and survival are greater if the twins have separate sets of organs , experts say			2
although success rates have improved over the years , surgical separation is still rare			0
since 1950 , at least one twin has survived separation about 75 percent of the time			0
after separation , most twins need intensive rehabilitation because of the malformation and position of their spines			0
although risky , there are many stories of successful separations			0
most recently , @entity217 twins @entity216 , who were born sharing an abdomen , pelvis , liver , kidney , large intestine and two legs , just celebrated seven years since they were separated aged four			2
their family said the girls , who are learning to walk with the aid of prosthetics , are the happiest and healthiest they have ever been .			0
