@entity0 today rushed to @entity1 to try to shore up his hope of becoming prime minister as a damning poll showed almost half of @entity1 are ready to back the @entity6			1
the @entity8 leader used a speech in @entity10 to claim the @entity12 election campaign has descended into ' desperation and panic ' , as some polls put @entity8 ahead across the @entity16			0
but mr @entity0 has been rocked by a survey showing that in @entity1 , 49 per cent of people plan to vote for the @entity6 , with just 25 per cent backing @entity8 , robbing him of any possibility of an overall majority			1
the new @entity37 poll for @entity38 shows @entity8 is down four points on last month to their lowest level since the survey began in 2007			1
the @entity6 is up three points to 49 per cent , a record high			0
support for the @entity45 was up two points at 18 per cent and backing for the @entity48 was up one point at 4 per cent			0
the results have delighted first minister @entity51 , who insisted she is taking ' absolutely nothing for granted '			0
' the polls are hugely encouraging and they show that that case that the @entity6 is putting forward for an end to austerity and support for the @entity58 and public services is winning support across @entity1			2
' ms @entity51 has offered to prop up a @entity8 government , even if the @entity12 win more seats on may 7			1
however , the @entity6 leader demanded full fiscal autonomy for @entity1 in return , meaning all money raised in tax north of the border would be spent there			1
labour leader @entity0 said the @entity6 's plan ' will mean a £ 7.6 billion hole in @entity1 's finances ' in a joint press conference , mr @entity0 was joined by his shadow chancellor @entity72 and @entity8 leader @entity73 the @entity6 has proposed ' a modest increase in public spending ' to end austerity and allow @entity1 's health budget to rise by £ 2 billion by 2020			1
' let us lift austerity and have spending increases in the next parliament that are fiscally responsible but allow us to spend more money on our vital public services like the health service , ' she said			0
' i am proposing an increase in spending in the health service across the @entity16 that would see by the end of this decade an additional £ 2 billion being spent on the @entity58 in @entity1			0
' that 's the choice we have at this election - continued austerity being proposed by the @entity12 and @entity8 , or an alternative to austerity , which is what the @entity6 is proposing , and we need a strong @entity1 voice in @entity98 that can force that alternative to austerity			1
' but in a joint press conference , mr @entity0 , his shadow chancellor @entity72 and @entity8 leader @entity73 said the @entity6 's plan ' will mean a £ 7.6 billion hole in @entity1 's finances '			1
mr @entity0 said : ' today i challenge @entity51 and the @entity6 to say how they will fill this gbp7.6 billion gap			1
which services will be cut ? which taxes will be raised ? and what cuts will it mean for pensioners in @entity1 when they are taken out of the @entity16 pensions system ? ' the @entity6 claim in this campaign to be proposing no reductions in spending , but in fact they are planning dramatic reductions in spending			2
they must now come clean			0
' @entity6 leader @entity51 , pictured in @entity120 today , has offered to prop up a @entity8 government , even if the @entity12 win more seats on may 7 ms @entity51 joined with local candidate @entity123 while on the campaign trail in @entity125 the latest poll results have delighted first minister @entity51 , who insisted she is taking ' absolutely nothing for granted ' mr @entity0 pledged : ' i will never sell @entity1 short by signing up to the @entity6 's plans			1
and i will never sell @entity16 short by abandoning the pooling and sharing of resources			0
because this is a pooling and sharing which benefits all parts of our country , because we look after each other and we know we can only tackle the problems our country faces across the whole of the @entity16			0
' speaking ahead of mr @entity0 's speech , ms @entity51 claimed that @entity8 was ' wrong ' in its analysis			2
' this is desperation on the part of the @entity148 , ' the @entity6 leader said during a campaign visit to @entity125			2
' instead of putting forward a positive case of their own , they are resorting to the same fears and smears that they resorted to during the referendum			0
' the truth is , the only cuts on the horizon for @entity1 are the ones that the @entity12 are proposing and @entity8 are backing			2
