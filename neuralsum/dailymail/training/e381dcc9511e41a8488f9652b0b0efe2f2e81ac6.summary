the @entity9 president 's appearances with everything from tigers to whales have been a staple of @entity9 state tv for years , cementing his image as a man of action			1

but in a meeting with a @entity42 critic after his latest stunt - taking to the skies in a light aircraft with a group of cranes last week - mr @entity1 admitted he had often taken part in media exercises which were carefully stage - managed			1

twenty other countries where tigers live , also started taking care of them , ' she quoted him as saying , referring to an incident four years ago when he was shown shooting a tiger with a tranquiliser gun in order to track it for a conservation project			0
critics later suggested the tiger had been driven in from a zoo for mr @entity1 to shoot for the tv cameras			0
' the leopards were also my idea , ' mr @entity1 was quoted as saying			0
' yes , i know , they were caught before but the most important thing is to draw public attention to the problem			0
' he was apparently referring to an episode in 2011 when he was shown tagging and releasing a rare and injured snow leopard			0
critics again said it had been brought in specially			0
' everything i do in this area ( wildlife conservation ) should have nothing to do with politics			0

' why did i dive ? not to show my gills off but to make sure people learn history			0
of course it was a set up , ' the journalist quoted mr @entity1 as saying			2

' mr @entity1 's summons to ms @entity54 appeared to be an attempt to mediate in her dispute with her former employer			0
she said that mr @entity1 , flanked by the magazine 's owner , asked her whether she really wanted to have her job back or whether she was comfortable with the role of ' a persecuted journalist '			1
