miss @entity2 , mp for @entity12 and a parliamentary aide to @entity3 leader @entity14 , suffered anaphylactic shock after attending the @entity16 , a @entity18 event at a @entity19 in @entity20 , near @entity21			1
during the event on saturday the politician , who has nut allergies , inadvertently ate a piece of cake that contained the ingredient			1
she began to feel unwell and took an antihistamine			1
however , around an hour later her condition worsened and she was taken to the @entity29			2
the mp was kept in overnight for observation and returned to work yesterday			1
around one in 100,000 people in @entity32 have severe reactions to nuts and around 20 die annually			1
foods such as peanuts , tree nuts – including almonds , walnuts , cashews , and @entity42 nuts – sesame , fish , shellfish , dairy products and eggs can all trigger a severe reaction , often referred to by the medical term anaphylaxis			1
following her recovery @entity52 , who is parliamentary under - secretary of state for employment relations , consumer and postal affairs and a junior equalities minister , spoke of the frightening incident on @entity56			2
she said : ‘ thankfully now recovered from anaphylaxis episode yesterday : huge appreciation to the fab staff at @entity29 for keeping me alive			2
’ last night , a @entity3 spokesman said the incident was ‘ wholly accidental ’			2
he added : ‘ @entity52 spent the night in hospital as a precaution			2

’ accident : miss @entity2 , mp for @entity12 , ate a piece of cake during a bake sale for @entity18 , unaware that it contained nuts anaphylaxis can affect the whole body , often within minutes of exposure to the substance that has caused the allergic reaction			1
besides foods , wasp or bee stings , natural latex , penicillin or any other drug or injection can also trigger an attack			0
symptoms typically include generalised flushing of the skin , a rash similar to that caused by nettle stings , a swelling of throat and mouth , and difficulty in swallowing or speaking			0
in the most severe cases , sufferers can collapse and fall into unconsciousness			0
any allergic reaction occurs because the body ’s immune system reacts inappropriately in response to the presence of a substance that it wrongly perceives as a threat			0
an anaphylactic reaction is caused by the sudden release of chemical substances , including histamine , from cells in the blood and tissues where they are stored			1
hidden danger : around one in 100,000 people in @entity32 have severe reactions to nuts and around 20 people die every year this mechanism is so sensitive that minute quantities of the allergen can cause a reaction			1
the released chemicals act on blood vessels to cause the swelling in the mouth and anywhere on the skin			0
there is a fall in blood pressure and , in asthmatics , the effect is mainly on the lungs			0
many people who know they have a serious allergy carry adrenaline auto - injectors			0
adrenaline , also known as epinephrine , acts quickly to constrict blood vessels , relax smooth muscles in the lungs to improve breathing , stimulate the heartbeat and help to stop swelling around the face and lips			0
