by @entity0 sniffing extraordinaires , dogs are known for their ability to suss out something by giving it a once - over			1
but this trick had them stumped			2
in a unique video that is sweeping the internet , more than 50 confused canines are seen gazing dumb - founded at a @entity12 camera on a pole			1
or even a strange plant			2
and each one has their own approach to sussing out what this knew object is			1
with humans off in the background , the clips are a glimpse into each dog 's own world that human videos rarely capture			2
all of them make eye contact with the lens before making their move			0
own world : humans are off in the background as these canines peer dumb - founded into the lens bored : some , however , seem less than impressed by the project , as this one lets out a dramatic yawn some are apprehensive as they peer stoically at the camera			2
thankfully , @entity12 cameras , often used for action shots , are made to be durable as some of the dogs fearlessly slam their slobbery noses onto the lens			1
one terrier seems to have worked it out as he delightedly performs for the camera			0
but another appears bored by the whole process , yawning dramatically			0
captured by @entity18 surfer and video blogger @entity17 , the result is a four - minute collection of some of the internet 's most heart - warming canine clips			1
and within hours it is already a hit on @entity83			0
one person commented : ' wonderful movie ! ' another said : ' this is so cool ! ' cute : the video shows them up - close - possibly closer than many people would care to get with a slobbery dog indignant : this terrior glares angrily at the apparatus as he stops playing with another dog to examine it others picked up on the drooling : ' how many gallons of lens cleaner did you end up using ? ? ' and most were smitten by the pets on show , desperate to get one of their own , with one commenter asking : ' what kind of dog is 1.05 ? i 'm loving how he / she looks			1
' mr @entity17 , from @entity112 , @entity18 , has been making videos for years , with his work regularly posted by the @entity12 team on their @entity117 page			1
gang : there may be three of them but curiosity leaves them standing still in the water mid-play surfing : many of surfer mr @entity17 's shots show dogs on a surf board or in the water despite being 90 per cent deaf , mr @entity17 has been praised for his choice of music synced with the shots despite being 90 per cent deaf , he is praised by viewers for his choice of music , which is timed perfectly with the shots			1
on his website he explains : ' i use @entity139 / @entity138 sign language			0
i can only hear 10 per cent in my left ear			0
' i can hear everything if i wear the hearing aid but i prefer it off most of the time ! i use it with subwoofer to edit the videos with the music			0
i ca nâ€™t understand the words when i listen to the music			0
