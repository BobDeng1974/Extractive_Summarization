comedian @entity0 has taken aim at the @entity3 government , prime minister @entity4 and the mainstream media following monday 's siege at the @entity8 cafe in @entity10 's @entity9			1
@entity0 criticised the way gunman man @entity12 was branded a terrorist by some media outlets , saying instead he was simply a mentally ill criminal			1
' this man is clearly a mentally ill criminal with a long history of mental illness and criminal behaviour and lots of evidence of instability , ' @entity0 said in a video posted to @entity24 as part of his @entity27 series			2
the comedian also blamed the media for fitting the story into their own frame , amid worldwide fears about @entity54			0
' it 's convenient for people to enhance and increase fear around @entity58 because currently there 's an appetite to increase security measures domestically , to engage in foreign military activity in that region of the world for economic and corporate ends			0
' brand criticised media reports that claimed gunman man @entity12 was a terrorist with links to @entity58 @entity12 kept 18 people captive for many hours until police stormed the cafe in the early hours of tuesday brand dispersed @entity3 news reports and addresses from mr @entity4 in between his statements , and made the claim that terrorism is more a structure upheld by governments as a tool of power than anything else			1
' terrorism is continually used as a tool to control a domestic population			0
i 'm not saying there are n't a lot of dangerous people out there , i 'm saying a lot of those people are in government , ' he said			0
@entity3 's new terror and metadata laws were also up for discussion , with @entity0 saying giving authorities the immunity from prosecution is very dangerous , especially in light of recent information surrounding the @entity103 and torture claims			1
brand also claimed prime minister @entity4 and the government used the situation to fit their own framework but he did acknowledge that ' we ' need to pull together in times such as these he however ended his bulletin on a more positive note , saying the # illridewithyou hashtag was ' an offer of solidarity '			1
' we have at this point got to pull together more than ever , when people control the media like @entity118 who says things like " @entity119 being white , all the @entity119 i know are white " , ' of course what 's happened in @entity3 is sad and of course there 's dangerous things going on in the world but our media uses that danger to suit their ends			2
' it 's really important in this time of division and fear that we embrace one another			0
us , the normal people in the middle , embrace one another			0
forget the extremists are either end of the social scale , whether they are motivated by religion or money or desire for power , and us , the ordinary people that want to make connections , have a right and a duty , in fact , to define the way we see reality , ' @entity0 concluded .			2
