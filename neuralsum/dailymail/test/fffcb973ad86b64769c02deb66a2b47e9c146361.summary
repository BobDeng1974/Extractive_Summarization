at two kilometres in circumference and protected by an imposing 12 - metre wall , the @entity1 's ' @entity0 ' had a reputation that struck fear into opposing armies			2
so much so that battle plans would be drawn up to specifically give the castle at @entity9 , in @entity12 's northern @entity11 province , a wide berth			2
now archaeologists have begun a daunting project to restore the once - mighty site to something approaching it previous glory , in particular the dilapidated outer wall that repelled every attack which invading @entity22 armies could throw at it			1

the fortress has huge historical , cultural and military significance and has key cultural relic status in @entity12			1
while much of the interior city is in good condition , the outer wall is somewhat dilapidated and will be the focus of much of the work the restoration work , which is due to be completed next year , will where possible be carried out in the style of @entity1 architecture the @entity1 ruled @entity12 for 276 years , between the years 1368 and 1644 , and is often described as the last of the great @entity12 dynasties			1
