outside the home : @entity6 visits the property in the documentary but does n't go inside			2
another family currently live there high hopes : the @entity128 received the house at a reduced rate because of the murders that had taken place just a year before their story was told in a best - selling book by @entity135 in 1977			1
it was made into the famous film starring @entity138 and @entity139			2

on the ' paranormal activity ' in the house , he says furniture would move around , voices would whisper to him and he experienced ' bodily possession '			0
the film follows @entity6 returning to the house , which is currently occupied by another family , but he does n't go in			1
it also shows him refusing to do a polygraph and his anger at experts who believe his experiences could be a case of false memory			0
the documentary 's maker @entity167 said the film is much more about what it was like to be the @entity171 rather than retelling the @entity75 horror stories			0
' he 's been carrying around this weight for nearly 40 years , ' he told the @entity174			0
' it 's not easy to talk about			0
' ' people being haunted by a haunting is not something i had seen before			0
the evidence we can present is this man 's life , everything that has happened for the last 40 years — it comes down to a family story and it 's quite tragic			1
' @entity6 's siblings did n't want to appear in the film			2
@entity84 is writing a book on the subject and @entity85 has never spoken about their time in @entity24 .			1
