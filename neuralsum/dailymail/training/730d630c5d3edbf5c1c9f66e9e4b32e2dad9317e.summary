by @entity0 published : 08:02 est , 2 october 2012 updated : 09:44 est , 2 october 2012 a pioneering brain doctor who was unfairly sacked for following his conscience is staging a hunger strike in protest at the ' unfair ' treatment of whistleblowers by the @entity8			1
dr @entity9 , 62 , a world authority on brain behaviour , lost his job at @entity13 , @entity14 , in 2010			1
the former president of the @entity16 claimed he was kicked out for blowing the whistle over underqualified and unsupervised staff treating patients at the hospital - a practice he claimed was endangering patients			0
protest : dr @entity9 is confronted by security staff outside the @entity25 in @entity26			1
an employment tribunal went on to rule he had been unfairly dismissed , but he was not reinstated			0
the doctor today staged the second day of a five day hunger strike outside the @entity25 head office , to protest his and other colleague 's treatment for raising concerns about the health service			1
dr @entity9 believes the @entity8 is rife with ' failures ' and feels staff are not treated or managed correctly , which has lead to the mistreatment of patients			1
he is calling on the government to impose a complete change to the health service and get rid of a ' dictatorial and secretive ' management structure			0
dr @entity9 will camp outside the building in @entity45 , @entity26 , for the whole week and if he gets moved on he will decamp to the statue of @entity47 , who has inspired him , in @entity48			2
dr @entity9 said : ' i undertake this five - day hunger - strike with reluctance but with resolve			1
' it pains my heart to see how failures in the @entity8 have contributed directly or indirectly to harming patient care , to a waste of public funds and to distress for @entity8 staff and their families			0
' over the past two years , i have repeatedly raised my concerns in a wide range of settings - @entity8 , legal and political - but with no tangible outcome to fix these failures in the @entity8			2
' i am fortunate that @entity66 has given me the strength , knowledge , experience , determination , resources and good health to be able to make a protest in this way			0
@entity13 in @entity14 , where dr @entity9 was dismissed in 2010			2
vocal : the doctor next to the sign outlining his grievances with the @entity8 ' i regard it as a moral and ethical responsibility to do what i can to bring about changes in the @entity8 that will benefit a large number of people			0
' i take my inspiration from the actions and words of @entity47 , whose birthday is this week on october 2 , and who also engaged in peaceful protests that included fasting			0
' during dr @entity9 ’s tribunal in july the panel ruled the hospital attempted to fast - track his dismissal by rehearsing witnesses after an investigation was launched into his conduct			1
the judgement read : ' the principal reason for dr @entity9 ’s dismissal was the fact there had been an irredeemable breakdown in trust , confidence and communication between himself on the one hand and a variety of management individuals within the trust organisation			2
' however , the tribunal found dr @entity9 , who had clashed with staff over how neuropsychology clinics should be run , was 75 per cent responsible for his own downfall			2
as a result , the panel said he would only receive 25 per cent of any compensation and would not return to work at the hospital			0
a @entity25 spokesperson said : ' we have taken action to support @entity8 whistleblowers , including strengthening the @entity8 constitution and setting up a new helpline to advise staff and help them understand their rights			1
' staff on the frontline know when patient care needs to improve - better support for whistleblowers will help create a culture where staff will be able to raise genuine concerns in good faith , without fear of reprisal			0
