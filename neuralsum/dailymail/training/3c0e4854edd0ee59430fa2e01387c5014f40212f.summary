by @entity0 for the @entity1 @entity2 has urged @entity4 fans to stick by the @entity6 club during what he called a ‘ period of transition ’			1
the @entity11 champions ’ end - of - year financial results showed an £ 11.2million pre-tax profit — up from last year ’s figure of £ 9.74m			1
and those figures will prompt fresh debate over the club ’s transfer strategy after they crashed out of the @entity18 amidst claims they could have spent more on players			1
@entity2 ( left ) pictured at the unveiling of @entity23 as the club 's manager reiterating a previous assertion that the plc board ‘ reinvest every penny ’ in the club , however , chief executive @entity2 attributed the @entity18 failure to a change in management at the club , saying : ‘ the appointment of @entity23 , a young manager with progressive ideas , marked the beginning of a period of transition for the club			1
‘ the board will support @entity23 and his coaching team in the transfer market and in the development of the football operation generally			1
‘ the board ’s commitment is clear			2
the board will re-invest every penny received back into the club for the longer term			1
' we will continue to invest , not only in our own academy but also to scour the world for talent to develop and to make a difference at the club			2
‘ we can not , however , put into jeopardy the long - term future of this club or its supporters with reckless spending			1
‘ the recent result in the qualifiers for the group stage for the @entity18 and some results in the @entity67 have been disappointing			1
' @entity68 is crucial to the club , but the experience of the appointments of @entity72 , @entity73 and @entity74 shows us that time is needed to develop through periods of transition			2
’ while the profit figure will grab the headlines , @entity4 ’s revenues were down by 14.6 per cent to £ 64.7m in a year when the team reached the @entity18 group stage and season - ticket holders were handed a £ 100 price cut			1
@entity2 has called on the @entity4 fans to stick by their club as they go through a stage of transition on june 30 , the club had £ 4m in the bank , with chairman @entity91 insisting the club will ‘ live within ( their ) means ’ in an impoverished @entity11 marketplace			1
‘ the board is highly conscious of the financial environment in which we play football here in @entity100 , ’ he said			2
‘ the harsh reality is that the total income from broadcasting rights available to the @entity11 game is a tiny fraction of what is available to our neighbours in @entity109			0
‘ within this context and in the face of these hard facts , the @entity110 has evolved the strategy that the club , financially , has to adopt a self - sustaining model			1
in plain words , we have to live within our means			0
we can not spend money that we do n’t have			0
’ the figures came as @entity23 admitted it would be a ‘ disaster ’ if the club failed to win a fourth successive title			0
@entity125 vents his frustration out during @entity4 's game with @entity128 earlier this season @entity129 , the club expected to pose the greatest challenge to the @entity133 champions , travel to @entity135 today			2
and @entity23 plans to throw recovered captain @entity136 and new signings @entity137 , @entity139 into his reshaped side following a stuttering start to the season			0
@entity4 have won just four of their 10 competitive games so far , crashing out of the @entity18 twice			0
conceding his real task is to steady the ship and retain the title , however , the @entity148 coach admitted : ‘ i know it ’s going to be tough in the first year , i have been through it before at smaller clubs			0
‘ but i have done it before and the fun part will come			0
to get there we need results			0
‘ but i have a very good squad and if we do n’t win the league it is a disaster			0
i know what the players can do and they know it , too			0
we have to keep working			0
