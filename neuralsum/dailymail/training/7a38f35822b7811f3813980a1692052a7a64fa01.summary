@entity1 owner @entity0 reminds me of @entity3			1
the kind of guy who says what he likes , and likes what he says			0
@entity9 did n’t like @entity3 , and i ’m not convinced the greatest manager in @entity1 ’ history would have appreciated @entity12			2
yet most @entity1 fans seem to adore the @entity14			1
@entity1 owner @entity0 ( centre ) is pictured in the stands with the fans at @entity18 on saturday absurd as it sounds , having a beer with fans in @entity22 close to the stadium , and sitting in the away end at @entity18 on saturday , has led to a situation where the @entity1 fans will worship the ground @entity0 walks on , and accept some of the bizarre decisions he has made in the short time he has been in charge			1
@entity0 might turn out to be the best owner @entity1 have ever had – i hope so because the city needs a thriving , healthy club to serve its huge fanbase			1
i lived and worked in @entity1 when they last won the title in the top flight – i ’m aware what the club means and how important it is in the city			2
on the face of it , it ’s shocking that @entity1 fans are so welcoming of this guy : he only turned his attention to @entity1 after failing to buy @entity48			1
this does n’t mean he has bad intentions , but the any club will do ' approach naturally invites scepticism			0
@entity0 asked for a huge fee from @entity55 for @entity56 , and he got it			2
fair play to him for that			0
so why tell the press the player refused to train , when on that day @entity56 claims he was having his medical in @entity63 ? no need for that from the owner , unless he ’s desperate to win favour with fans			2
i ’ve heard @entity1 supporters declare openly that @entity0 ’s version is what ' really ' happened , dismissing @entity56 ’s version for no real reason other than he ’s no longer connected to @entity1			1
how can they be so sure ? @entity55 's @entity56 ( centre ) pictured during a club training session earlier this month @entity77 was sacked and then reinstated and then sacked again			0
@entity78 was hired from non-league - @entity12 admitted he told @entity79 to ' shut the f * * * k up ' and did n’t want his opinion			0
as most had predicted , @entity83 did n’t last long			0
if you include caretaker @entity86 , there have been four managers at @entity1 since @entity0 took over in april			1
when asked why he has hired the new one , @entity88 , @entity0 replied : ' he ’s good - looking			0
' throw in an ongoing troublesome yacht taxation issue back in @entity14 , which the @entity90 describes as a ' cloud hanging over @entity0 ' and which could still give the @entity90 cause to re-assess his qualification as a fit and proper person to own a club in this country , and it all makes you wonder why the @entity1 fans have fallen for this guy			1
surely a beer with the fans in the pub and a seat in the away end at @entity18 were n’t enough to seduce supporters ? @entity12 ( right ) sits with former @entity1 manager @entity77 at @entity107 in april this year spending money on players might have persuaded a few			1
but do n’t they remember @entity111 ? he spent huge amounts of money on players , and the financial collapse as a consequence was painful			0
the truth is this : @entity0 is benefiting from @entity1 ’ recent history			1
@entity120 ’ regime created a massive rift between the fans and the club			0
then @entity124 made a mess of things , leaving the fans disillusioned and desperate			0
so desperate that they have seemingly taken this sacking - machine @entity14 with a potentially nuclear tax bomb waiting to explode , into their hearts			0
former @entity1 chairman @entity133 ( right ) at the unveiling of new signing @entity135 in 2000 i know only too well that if you say anything remotely negative about @entity1 , their fans will hammer you			1
so in the week he took control of the club , @entity0 gave an interview and said the words that he knew would capture the love and dedication of so many long - suffering fans			1
he had them when he said : ' the fans of @entity1 are tired of eating sh * t and shutting their mouths			2
' those fans fell for @entity0 right then			2
i hope he does n’t break their hearts .			0

@entity1 owner @entity0 sat with the fans in the away end at @entity18 on saturday
the @entity14 has also joined fans for a beer in a pub near @entity161
it has led to a situation where the @entity1 fans worship the ground he walks on
