@entity1 striker @entity0 has completed his move back to former club @entity3			1
the 29 - year - old , known as ' @entity0 ' , has returned to @entity5 following a short , but disappointing spell on @entity7			2
@entity0 joined the club from @entity10 outfit @entity9 for Â£ 3.2million in january , and is understood to have left for slightly less after failing to score in his eight appearances for the @entity1			1
flop : @entity0 has left @entity1 to join former club @entity3 a club statement said : ' striker @entity0 has completed a move to @entity16 club @entity3			1
' @entity0 , who joined @entity1 in january , has signed a five - year deal with the @entity19 club for an undisclosed fee			2
' the confirmation from @entity1 comes after @entity3 revealed on wednesday that @entity0 was returning to the club			1
his departure came as head coach @entity25 's hopes of welcoming a new addition took a turn for the better with the news that @entity31 full - back @entity29 is close to completing a move to the @entity33			1
it is understood the @entity1 are hopeful of striking a deal for the 23 - year - old @entity36 international within the next 24 hours after becoming increasingly frustrated in their pursuit of @entity41 defender @entity40			1
@entity42 of class : @entity44 seen here playing for @entity45 ( left ) and the @entity36 national team ( right ) this year depleted : @entity25 know he faces a race against time to get players in before the start of the season indeed , club officials were hopeful of including @entity44 in the party heading off for a pre-season training camp in @entity54 on friday			0
the @entity42 , who came through the ranks at @entity31 while sporting director @entity56 was at the club , has spent the last two - and - a - half seasons on loan at @entity45			0
he has made only nine senior appearances for the @entity61 and has been sent out on loan to five different clubs , including a month at @entity64 in 2010			0
however , he has indicated that he feels his future lies away from @entity66 , and @entity1 are keen to take advantage of his hunger for regular first - team football			0
@entity44 's capture does not necessarily preclude a continuation of efforts to land @entity40 , who proved a key player on loan last season , but it would provide a welcome boost for @entity25 , whose hopes of sealing a permanent deal for @entity79 are also yet to be realised			2
in addition , the @entity80 has confirmed his interest in compatriot and @entity85 midfielder @entity84			2
on the radar : @entity25 's compatriot and @entity89 winger @entity84 @entity25 told the @entity90 : ' this has been out for a few days and this week i had a chat with people in @entity80 , who are obviously desperate for @entity84 to come with us			1
at the moment , it 's a possibility , but it 's no more than that			0
' he 's a player that i admire a lot because he 's got power , desire and experience playing with the top teams			0
' he wants to play football , he 's desperate to be playing week in , week out			0
' there are plenty of positives , but there is something you need to do ( agreeing a deal ) before having a player like that available			0

@entity0 leaves @entity1 to return to @entity5 with @entity3 's
@entity0 only arrived in january and made just eight appearances
@entity25 hopeful of landing @entity31 left back @entity29
