by @entity0 furious : police are unable to retrieve @entity3 and @entity5 's stolen £ 30,000 caravan because officers have no legal powers to remove a traveller family now living in it a couple whose £ 30,000 caravan was stolen have been told a traveller family now living in it can not be removed because it would breach their human rights			1
@entity17 and her partner @entity5 spent their life savings on the top - of - the - range camper and were devastated when it vanished from the secure site where they kept it			1
when police eventually found the 26ft - long @entity30 caravan 18 months later , its owners were told a traveller couple and their two young children were living in it only ten miles from their home in @entity35			1
their initial relief turned to outrage , however , when the police said they had ‘ no lawful powers ’ to get it back			1
they were told their only option was to begin costly civil proceedings against the family , which they say they can not afford			0
mrs @entity17 and mr @entity5 had spent £ 10,000 improving the £ 20,000 caravan , including putting in a widescreen tv			1
they bought the vehicle on hire purchase – and still have to make monthly payments of £ 250 for the next two years			0
hospital ward clerk @entity54 , 68 , said : ‘ why should we have to pay for someone else to live in our brand new caravan ? that was for our pleasure in our older years			0
‘ the police said that removing the family would breach their human rights and that they would have to be rehoused before it could be seized			2
we spent all our retirement money on that caravan because we thought it would last us a lifetime			0
it seems as though no one cares about our human rights			0
‘ i ’ve worked all my life and saved up , surely i have the right to enjoy my retirement ? when that caravan was stolen , our right to a happy retirement was stolen			2
’ the couple , who live in a semi-detached home in @entity80 , @entity35 , were in between insurance policies at the time of the theft in 2011 so were not covered for a payout			2
holiday : mrs @entity3 is pictured by the caravan on an earlier trip before it was stolen pride and joy : ms @entity3 and mr @entity5 's 26ft long caravan before it was stolen from a storage site in @entity94 powerless : a letter from @entity96 informed the couple that officers would be unable to retrieve the stolen caravan in an apologetic letter , pc @entity100 of @entity96 told them the matter was out of the force ’s hands			1
it read : ‘ unfortunately it has transpired that we have no lawful power to recover the caravan			2
it will be the responsibility of you as the owner to start civil proceedings against the current occupier			0
’ the letter added : ‘ i sincerely apologise for this decision and i am sure that you feel the onus has been put back to you but my hands have been tied due to police powers			1
’ last september police located and identified the caravan in @entity124 , @entity94 , after interviewing a suspect for an unrelated offence			2
but because officers did not have evidence that the current occupier knew the caravan was stolen when he allegedly purchased it , he could not be prosecuted and the force said it was unable to seize it			1
mr @entity5 , 53 , who gave up his job as an hgv driver after being diagnosed with diabetes , said the police refused to reveal the caravan ’s exact location			1
‘ i just can not comprehend it , ’ he said			0
‘ if i was stopped by the police and it turned out my car , which i had brought in good faith , was stolen , it would be confiscated and i would lose my money			2
’ mr @entity5 said they bought the caravan in 2007 and would use it for family weekends away in @entity147 , @entity148 , @entity149 and the south coast			1
it was stolen from a secure storage site in @entity153 , @entity94 , after thieves disabled the alarm and cut through a wheel clamp and lock			0
gone : the couple 's caravan was stolen from this storage park in @entity94 in 2011 when the caravan was eventually found the couple were asked to provide proof of ownership , a logbook and photos			1
they learned that the family found living in the caravan had taken it all over the country before temporarily settling down ten miles away from them			1
mr @entity5 said : ‘ apparently they had a receipt for it and had paid a guy £ 300 in a pub for it			0
‘ they had no proof apart from a handwritten note on a scrap of paper , while we had everything proving it was ours			0
if they wanted a caravan , why not save up for it like we did ? ‘ i have lost all faith in the police			0
it seems that they have completely let us down and turned their backs on us			0
’ a @entity96 spokesman said : ‘ a 22 - year - old man from @entity124 was arrested and interviewed on suspicion of theft , however there was insufficient evidence to prove he had been involved in the theft , or would have known the caravan was stolen when he bought it			0
he was released with no further action			0
‘ we have no police powers to seize the caravan and have advised the owners to seek civil action in order to recover it			1

@entity3 and @entity5 had their caravan stolen in 2011
they were delighted when it was found by police 18 months later
but officers are unable to move a traveller family now living there
a letter sent to the couple says the police have ' no lawful powers '
