it is one of nature ’s great ocean explorers , a giant creature that swims 13,000 miles in a year and can live to the age of 100			2
but rather than roaming the seven seas , this 34 - stone leatherback sea turtle is undergoing treatment in a @entity10 aquarium after it swallowed a floating plastic bag			1
the leatherback , nicknamed @entity13 , was found dangerously ill on a remote beach in @entity15			1
eating plastic could cause a build - up of gas in the digestive tract , making the turtle buoyant and washing it to shore			1
the incident is a stark illustration of the damage humans are doing to the environment by dumping millions of tons of plastic rubbish into our oceans			2
recent studies estimate 8million tons of bags , bottles , toys and other rubbish ends up in the seas each year – affecting up to 400 different marine species , many of them endangered			0
the @entity59 has been campaigning since 2008 for tougher action to reduce plastic bag waste			0
a major victory in the @entity64 campaign came in june last year when a 5p charge for plastic bags was announced in @entity67			0
the charge , which will be introduced by october , is expected to reduce bag use by up to 80 per cent and raise up to £ 100million a year for good causes			0
the aquarium hopes to release @entity13 soon because leatherbacks do not cope well in captivity wildlife experts rescued the rare leatherback from a beach on saturday			1
@entity77 , a turtle expert at the @entity79 in @entity29 , said it took five people to haul the giant beast from the beach			1
they rode in a 4x4 truck through mud and marshland to get to the leatherback , before using a winch to get it on to the vehicle			0
there were few signs of external injury to the beast , leading conservationists to conclude it had probably swallowed a plastic bag			0
‘ leatherbacks feed primarily on jellyfish so it is very possible that plastics – such as bags that look like jellyfish – could be causing a gastro - intestinal issue , ’ mrs @entity77 added			0
leatherbacks , the biggest of all the sea turtles , swim in six of the seven oceans , roaming up to 13,000 miles a year in their search for food and nesting sites			1
the leatherback turtle ’s dark blue shell is leathery to the touch – giving it its name			2
the animal is officially endangered , with global populations of nesting females having dropped from 115,000 in 1980 to as few as 34,000 in recent years			0
@entity13 has responded well to antibiotics and other treatment , and the aquarium hopes to release it in the next few days .			1

rare leatherback sea turtle was found stranded on a @entity15 beach
@entity13 , the huge creature was so big he did *n't* fit on scales
he is now being treated with fluids and antibiotics at a *nearby* aquarium
*veterinarians* believe he may have become stranded after eating plastic
sea turtles often mistake plastic *debris* for jellyfish , their favourite food
