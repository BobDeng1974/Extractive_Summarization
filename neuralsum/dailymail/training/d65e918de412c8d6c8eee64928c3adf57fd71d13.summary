mr @entity3 is the first member of @entity8 ’s inner circle , which also included mr @entity12 , to publish details of how they seized control of the party			1
the book is expected to reveal mr @entity12 ’s behaviour in the dying days of the last government and will be scrutinised for material critical of the @entity4 leader			2
the timing of the announcement is a second blow to mr @entity12 after his brother @entity33 quit @entity35 politics admitting he could not work for him			2
mr @entity3 – known as ‘ @entity36 ’ by his allies and ‘ @entity38 ’ by his enemies – resigned in april 2009 after emails he wrote smearing senior @entity41			2
his book , @entity43 : @entity44 , will lift the lid on mr @entity8 ’s government and his rows with chancellor @entity48 during the financial crisis			1
mr @entity48 famously accused mr @entity8 and mr balls of unleashing the ‘ forces of hell ’ in a briefing against him			0
in a statement yesterday , publishers @entity56 said : ‘ it is a book which will send shivers down the back of the @entity4 establishment as it reveals the truth about life within @entity8 ’s government			0
mr @entity3 was at @entity8 's side for a decade , before being forced to quit in 2009 over plans to smear @entity68 mps with false rumours ‘ [ mr @entity3 ] writes candidly about his experiences at the heart of government , and provides the first genuine insider ’s account of @entity8 ’s time as chancellor and prime minister			1
‘ he reveals the personal feuds , political plots , and media manipulation which lay at @entity4 ’s core , and provides a fascinating , funny , and at times shocking account of how government really works			0
’ a @entity4 source said : ‘ under @entity12 ’s leadership , the party has moved a long way from those days			0
we have turned a page			0
’ the decision to break cover four years after he quit will fuel talk in @entity94 that mr @entity3 is seeking to clear the air and make a return to frontline politics			0
he took aim at @entity99 earlier this week , claiming ‘ timidity ’ had held back the former foreign secretary			0
mr @entity102 has used a blog to reveal the inner workings of the @entity8 administration , which have become a must - read for journalists and @entity67			0
the memoir , due to be published during the autumn labour conference , will lay bare the extraordinary feud between @entity8 and @entity110 in the battle over who should be prime minister just yesterday mr @entity3 took a swipe at @entity99 , who announced he was quitting @entity35 politics two and a half years after losing the @entity4 leadership contest			1
mr @entity3 said mr @entity12 failure of nerve had stopped him from moving against mr @entity8 before the last general election : ' his huge moment was 2008 but we monstered him because of his timidity			1
' the memoir is likely to make for uncomfortable reading for mr @entity12 , who worked alongside mr @entity8 and mr @entity3 in the @entity124 before becoming an mp but has sought to play down his links with the former pm			1
@entity128 , @entity4 ’s shadow chancellor , was also a close ally of mr @entity3 but sought to distance himself after the communications chief was forced to quit in 2009			1
mr @entity3 gave a flavour of life working for mr @entity8 last year in a blog post on the @entity127 's infamous temper			1
he wrote : ' there are two phrases that every former @entity8 staffer got used to hearing when he could n’t hide his exasperation with them any longer			0
the memoir is expected to make for uncomfortable reading for @entity4 leader @entity12 and shadow chancellor @entity128 , who were both close aides to mr @entity8 before becoming mps ' the first – delivered slowly and usually punctuated with a pounding fist on the back of a chair – was “ too			1
” the second – delivered in a strangled growl , usually at the person he wanted to murder on the spot – was : “ i need new people ”			0
' @entity153 , the former @entity68 blogger who is now managing director of publishers @entity56 , said : ‘ i have absolute confidence in predicting @entity3 ’s book will be seen as the political memoir of the year			1
‘ i ’ve been chasing this book for at least eighteen months and am delighted to have persuaded @entity3 to put pen to paper			0
‘ everyone knows from his blog that @entity3 is a brilliantly incisive writer and that he was in a unique position to expose what being at the centre of power in the @entity8 government was really like			2
’ after being cast out of the @entity4 fold , mr @entity3 has used his blog to give a brutally honest account of the @entity8 regime ’s failings			2
mr @entity3 said : ‘ given that @entity153 was one of my supposed enemies when i was working in @entity173 , he was the last person i expected to be working with , but his thoughts on what this book should be about exactly matched my own , and i am delighted to be publishing it with him			0
‘ i hope that , like my blog , this book will be a chance not only to give my account of what happened during @entity8 's time in office , but also to give an insight into what life is like for those working in government today			1
’ royalties will be split between the @entity192 aid agency @entity191 , where mr @entity3 now works , and the appeal by his former employers @entity194 to build a new sixth - form centre .			0
