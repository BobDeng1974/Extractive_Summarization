‘ she is awake and aware of people			0
she can sometimes move her hands and feet			0
if a song comes on that she likes then she will move her feet around			0
‘ all i want is for her to talk and tell me how she feels			0

three times i was told she was not going to make it , but she is still fighting			0

@entity145 and donations from the public have enabled the family to stay near @entity4 in hospital			2

people can sponsor ms @entity30 ’s run by visiting her just giving page			0
@entity4 ( pictured in hospital ) can now make noises , grunts and groans but can not yet talk contrary to popular belief , a cardiac arrest is not the same as a heart attack			1
a cardiac arrest occurs when the heart suddenly and unexpectedly stops beating due to a malfunction in its electrical system			2
it is caused by an abnormal rhythm , or arrhythmia			0
anyone can suffer a cardiac arrest and it can happen at any time and without warning			0
symptoms include unresponsiveness , loss of consciousness , lack of pulse and stopping breathing			0
in contrast , a heart attack can be thought of as a problem with the heart 's plumbing - it occurs when an artery supplying the heart becomes blocked			2
this causes the heart muscle to begin to die slowly while the patient usually remains awake and alert .			1
