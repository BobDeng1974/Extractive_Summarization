by @entity0 published : 07:31 est , 25 october 2013 updated : 12:48 est , 25 october 2013 we all get sick of decorations at this time of year - so this fed - up tiger took matters into her own hands			2
@entity8 big cat called @entity9 was determined to bring down a carved pumpkin which her keepers had suspended from a tree at @entity14 , @entity15			1
the tiger was joined by her two sisters , @entity19 and @entity20 , but none were successful in bringing the seasonal squash to the floor			1
keepers stuffed several pumpkins with @entity31 treats for animals in their care it 's grrrreat ! the tiger gets more frustrated as she is joined by her sisters @entity19 and @entity20			1
@entity39 tigers are better known as @entity8 tigers and have been wiped out in all but a small part of @entity42			2
there are just 500 the trio were given the tasty snack by their keepers at the @entity48			1
the vegetables had been hollowed out and filled with treats , providing a mental and physical work - out for the animals			1
staff also treated other animals , including the macaque monkeys , who clambered all over their pumpkin and used it like a swing			0
the pumpkins were given to red pandas and anteaters , one of which used its elongated snout to investigate			2
keeper @entity67 said : ' it ’s become something of a tradition for us to have a competition to see which members of staff can come up with the best carved pumpkin			1
' for the animals , the pumpkins ’ appearance was of a lot less interest than what was inside as we had hidden a variety of treats within them			1
' the tigers in particular got very excited and were literally leaping off the ground to get to theirs			0
' the anteaters made good use of their extra-long tongues to give the inside of their pumpkin a thorough inspection			0
going ... : getting desperate , the tiger climbs the tree from which the pumpkin is hanging - but has no luck going ... : she bats the pumpkin around a few more times before finally sinking her jaws into it , right gone ! her mission a success , @entity9 goes for a swim with her new treat			0
keeper @entity67 said : ' for the animals , the pumpkins ' appearance was of a lot less interest than what was inside ' he added : ' once again though it was the monkeys who seemed to get the most from the experience			1
' they not only got all the treats inside but also used the pumpkin as a swing before then breaking it up in to smaller segments and sharing it amongst them			2
' the @entity39 tiger is better known as the @entity8 tiger and is the largest of all the big cats			0
fully grown females can weigh up to 25st and measure more than 6ft 6in from head to tail			0
they are native to far east @entity135 and are critically endangered after their numbers dropped to around 40 in the 1940s			0
their current population is about 500 , the highest in 100 years .			0

keepers at @entity14 , @entity15 , stuffed pumpkins with treats
@entity145 leaped into the *air* to bat the squash like a *basketball*
