by @entity0 @entity1 : 07:26 est , 27 december 2013 @entity2 : 09:20 est , 27 december 2013 while many @entity3 will have unwrapped gleaming new household appliances as presents this @entity5 , one retired couple would not dream of replacing their 88 - year - old vacuum cleaner - which also spray paints , grinds coffee , and even minces meat			0
@entity12 , 61 , and her husband @entity13 , 63 , have been using their @entity15 multi-purpose appliance since it was given to them as a wedding present in 1976			1
remarkably , the plastic - and - metal gadget , which does four household chores in one ( although presumably not at the same time ) , was built in 1925 but is still going strong today and has never broken down			2
odd jobs : the ancient @entity15 multi-purpose machine comes with an array of adaptors to convert it into a vacuum cleaner , a coffee grinder and even a meat mincer all in one : the @entity15 is as well suited to the garage or shed , with its drill and metal grinding extensions , as it was in the kitchen , with the food blender and meat mincer adaptors the @entity15 - which cost 20 guineas , around £ 25 in today ’s money - works as a conventional vacuum cleaner while another chamber can be used as a paint sprayer			1
it was made by @entity43 company @entity41 in the early 20th century and was promoted as the future of household appliances			2
two other chambers operate as a coffee grinder and even a food processor , which specialises in mincing meat			0
handy work : the vacuum appliance , as demonstrated by @entity12 , 61 , right , still works as well as it did when the manual , left , was printed almost a century ago @entity53 : this picture taken from the @entity15 instruction manual illustrates just one of the many tasks to which the @entity15 could be put built to last : the piccolo machine might be 88 - years - old but it is still performing as faultlessly in mrs @entity12 's kitchen , left , as it did when it was shown off fresh from the factory in the instruction manual , right all - in - one : the motor in the @entity15 could drive a range of tools , including metal grinders and wire brushes hard grind : a man puts his @entity15 to work grinding off the rust from his car roof in this illustration from the instruction manual @entity74 : when the @entity15 left the factory in the mid 1920s few people could have imagined it would still be put to use , amongst other things , as a meed mincer , right , @entity12 , a retired cleaner , from @entity80 , @entity81 , recently won a competition to find the oldest working appliance in the @entity84			1
the prize - winning device , which is showing no sign of its age , used to belong to an salesman uncle who had kept the unused @entity15 in storage for decades before it was eventually given to the couple as a wedding present			1
she said : ' my husband ’s aunt gave us the @entity15 as a wedding gift			1
' it was almost brand new and still in its wrapper so obviously had not been used very much			0
present : an aunt gave @entity12 and @entity102 , pictured on their wedding day in july 1976 held at @entity106 registry office , the @entity15 as a gift standing the test of time : @entity12 and @entity102 , pictured on their wedding day in july 1976 were given the @entity15 as a gift which is still running as well today as it was when it left the factory 88 years ago state - of - the - art : the @entity15 instruction manual shows owners how to adapt their new cutting edge piece of household technology into the different appliances ' we were absolutely delighted , it was quite a space - age thing to have in your house at that time and i remember our neighbours popped in just to have a look at it in action			1
' it ’s a coffee grinder , a mincer , a food processor , a vacuum cleaner , paint sprayer - you name it , it can do it			0
' the attachments all plug into one machine			2
our son , @entity138 , still uses it to vacuum his car and i use the meat mincer and the coffee grinder			0
dependable : @entity12 , from @entity80 , @entity144 , has been using the @entity15 multi-purpose appliance since it was given to them as a wedding present in 1976 robust : mrs @entity12 shows off her @entity15 and its tool kit which has never broken in almost four decades useful : this page from the instruction manual shows just a few of the jobs that the @entity15 can help with ' it has never once broken down and is the most reliable appliance i have ever used			1
' i use some of the attachments more than others , like the mincing machine i use the most			2
' the mincer is useful when i have cooked a joint of meat and i have some left over			0
i slice the meat up and dice it and then ram it into the mincer with onions			0
' i have also used it as a buffering machine , when i lived in my father ’s house i used to get his floor really clean with it by putting a cloth on the end because the vacuum was n’t very good			0
@entity174 : as well as being able to grind your meat and vacuum your carpets , the @entity15 could also be transformed into a spray gun so you could paint your walls functional : a housewife shows off the @entity15 's paint spraying adaptor , left , while a husband sets about doing some woodwork with the same machine in these illustrations from the instruction manual versatility : the @entity15 had an almost limitless number of uses depending on what adaptor was added to the motor ' we used the coffee grinder a lot in the past but now my husband does n’t buy that kind of coffee			1
' i will never give it up for anything modern			0
modern appliances are just not as strong			0
' at @entity5 it is constantly being used , either to prepare food or clean up afterwards			0
' i pity those people who have to make do with modern gadgets , i would be lost without my @entity15			2
' all eventualities covered : the owner of the @entity15 made up as a mincer , left , and with a polishing disc , right , had almost any household @entity213 emergency or job covered with the adaptable machine @entity12 showcased the @entity15 at @entity217 shop in nearby in @entity218 , when it launched a contest to find the region ’s oldest working household gadget			1
the managing director @entity222 , said : ' it ’s surprising what people have still got in good working order but we were stunned when @entity12 brought in her @entity15			1
' all the @entity15 made were made between 1925 and 1930 by a @entity43 company and they were then imported into the country			1
' i think at the time they would have been worth about 20 guineas , so about £ 25 in today ’s money which was about a month ’s wages then			0

@entity12 and @entity102 got the @entity15 appliance as a wedding gift in 1976
device was built in 1925 but is still working faultlessly
piccolo machine was sold as the future of home *maintenance*
