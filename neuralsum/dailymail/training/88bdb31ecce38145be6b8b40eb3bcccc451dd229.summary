a space entrepreneur and billionaire has teased plans for a ' hyperloop ' super train which he claims will enable people to make the 380 - mile journey between @entity7 and @entity8 in just 30 minutes - faster than it takes to fly			1
@entity10 claims his super train , which he describes as a cross between ' a @entity13 , a rail gun , and an air - hockey table ' , will travel at speeds twice as fast as a plane and make the trip in half an hour			1
he plans to reveal the full details , including how the train would work and the maximum running speed , next month but claims an engineer who tweeted a hypothetical drawing of the train and its tracks was the ' closest guess so far			1
many people have tried to guess how the proposed transport system might work but engineer @entity33 's explanation ( pictured ) has come the closest so far , according to the tech entrepreneur an alternative theory , put forward by physicist @entity36 , suggests the hyperloop could be a pneumatic transport system consisting of a closed tube making loops between @entity7 and @entity8			1
the idea was inspired by plans proposed during the early 1900s , pictured while some may think his ideas plain loopy , @entity10 has a track - record of thinking big			1
he is the ceo of @entity46 , the first private company to send supplied to the @entity48 as well as founding @entity49 and electronic car manufacturer @entity50			0
@entity10 said that he will publish an ' alpha design ' for his ambitious transportation project on 12 august			2
@entity10 teased the plans initially during the @entity55 in @entity56 in may			1
many people have been trying to guess what @entity10 's hyperloop system might look like and how it might work			1
it currently takes around 12 hours on the @entity62 train to make the journey between the two cities			0
the journey can be done in around eight hours in a car and it takes just one and half hours to fly			0
the top secret hyperloop train will take passengers along a route from @entity7 to @entity8 , pictured , in a mere half hour			1
in a tweet , the @entity50 co-founder behind the plans promised to publish the alpha design by 12 august engineer @entity33 tweeted his vision of how hyperloop could be realised and @entity10 responded to his drawing with a tweet that said : ' your guess is the closest i 've seen anyone guess so far '			1
@entity10 has been teasing his high - speed transport network plans for around a year and has previously described it as ' a cross between a @entity13 , a rail gun , and an air - hockey table '			1
another idea about how the super-train might work came from @entity92 physicist @entity36			0
@entity36 ruled out two popular theories ; that the train could involve a vacuum tunnel or could be accelerated along the track using an electromagnetic cable system			0
instead , @entity36 believes that @entity10 is proposing a subsonic train			1
he thinks the hyperloop will be a pneumatic transport system that ' consists of a closed tube making loops between @entity7 and @entity8 and passengers would ride in capsules within the tube			1
' the tech entrepreneur claims that his hyperloop super train could be three to four times faster than a ballet train like this one from the @entity110			1
however he has plenty of problems to overcome from finding a business partner to obtaining land for this ambitious transport project @entity10 claims that his hyperloop super train will connect the @entity56 cities of @entity7 ( @entity118 is pictured left ) and @entity8 ( right ) with journey times of just 30 minutes he first talked about the hyperloop in july 2012 in an interview with tech site @entity122			1
he said that the system will never crash , is immune to weather , is three or four times faster than a conventional bullet train and travels twice as fast as the average speed of an aircraft			2
he has also reportedly said that the ambitious system could be powered by solar energy and even generate more energy that it would use			0
@entity10 believes the super fast service would have a build cost of around $ 6bn			1
while this might sound like a lot , current plans for a bullet train service between @entity7 and @entity8 with a time of around 3 hours is predicted to cost in the region of $ 68bn			1
responding to questions on @entity142 , @entity10 said that his first design and possibly the technologies involved will be open source and that ' critical feedback for improvements would be much appreciated '			1
@entity10 was born in @entity148 , @entity149 before moving to @entity150 and later the @entity151 he taught himself how to program a computer and by the time he reached 12 year 's old he had created and sold his first software program - a space game called @entity155 - for around $ 500			2
@entity10 started @entity156 - an online content publishing software - in 1998 with his brother , @entity158 , which was bought in 1999 by @entity161 's @entity160 division for a reported $ 300million			2
@entity10 then co-found @entity164 - an online finance and email payment company - and a year later this firm merged with @entity166 , which later became known as @entity49			2
in october 2002 , @entity49 was bought by @entity167 for $ 1.5billion in stock and @entity10 , the company 's largest shareholder , owned 11.7 per cent of these shares			2
in june 2002 @entity10 founded @entity46 ( @entity46 )			2
@entity46 develops and manufactures space launch vehicles			0
the company 's first two launch vehicles were the @entity176 and @entity177 9 rockets and its first spacecraft is @entity179			0
@entity46 was awarded a billion - dollar @entity181 contract in december 2008 , for 12 flights of their @entity177 rocket and dragon spacecraft to the @entity48 , replacing the @entity185 after it retired in 2011			0
initially , @entity186 will replace the cargo transport function of the shuttle and astronaut transport will be handled by the @entity190			0
@entity10 is also co-founder and head of product design at @entity50			2
he was previously ceo of the company but due to reported layoffs in the company , he took a different position in 2008			0
he is reported to have a 32 per cent stake in the car company , which is currently valued above $ 12 billion , as of 29 may 2013			0
additionally , @entity10 provided the initial concept for @entity200 , which was co-found with his cousin @entity201 , and @entity10 is the company 's largest shareholder and chairman of the board			2
@entity200 is the largest provider of solar power systems in the @entity151 his cousin @entity201 is the ceo and co-founder			0
he said : ' i really hate patents unless critical to company survival			0
will publish @entity210 as open source			1
' he also suggested that he could consider a partnership if he can find someone with the ' shared philosophical goal of breakthrough tech done fast & without wasting money on b * * * * * * t ' he tweeted			2
there is much speculation about how the grand project could work			0
according to @entity223 , the most likely scenario is a maglev train running in vacuum tubes			0
this type of train is non-contact and electric - powered so is not slowed down by friction and could reach incredibly fast speeds using a relatively small amount of power			0
the idea has been around for years but have never been really successful executed			0
as well as relatively new technology , the hyperloop transport system faces additional challenges , including securing land in a picturesque and expensive location			0
however , answering questions from the public about his latest venture , mr @entity10 said that the super train will be safe to use in areas prone to earthquakes			1
previous theories of how hyperloop might work include a series of conveyor belts and even pneumatic tubes to push passengers along the line .			0

@entity10 will reveal how his ' hyperloop ' super train works next month
the tech entrepreneur claims it will let people travel between @entity8 and @entity7 in just 30 minutes
the ' train ' could also travel up to twice as fast as a plane
@entity10 's plans will be open source and he is *encouraging* ' critical feedback for improvement '
