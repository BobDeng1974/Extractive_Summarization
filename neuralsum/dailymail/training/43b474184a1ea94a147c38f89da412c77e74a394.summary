by @entity0 for @entity1 consumer advocacy group choice are leading the charge against the @entity5 's controversial internet filter proposal by producing a crowd - funded advertisement mocking it			1
through the proposal , the government hopes to stem the tide of music and movie piracy			1
choice 's satirical advertisement features a fictitious minister for the @entity15 launching his hand - made internet filter			1
with @entity32 's national anthem swelling , he attempts to deliver his rehearsed lines about the benefits of the filter but fails to do so while it continuously falls apart on him			2
' your government has come up with a fool - proof plan to stop internet piracy , ' the minister for the @entity15 says			1
' every connection in @entity32 will be fixed with one of these			0
' the increased price we all pay for the internet will be worth it for this 100 per cent effective solution			0
' it features a fictitious minister for the @entity15 who introduces a dodgy , hand - made internet filter to viewers during the minister 's speech , a part of the internet filter falls off			1
at the end of @entity60 's video , it urges people to log on to the group 's website to sign a petition against the filter			1
the 30 - second video is part of a campaign @entity60 is leading against the proposal , which they believe would make the internet more expensive without effectively addressing piracy			1
' we believe the government has its policy settings wrong when it comes to combating online copyright infringement , ' choice campaigns manager @entity73 said			2
choice campaigns manager @entity73 said the consumer advocacy group does not believe introducing the filter will reduce internet piracy ' @entity32 are frustrated with not being able to access and pay for timely and affordable content			1
' it ’s this frustration that is driving some consumers to seek a better deal on legitimate overseas sites like @entity87 , and unfortunately driving others to illegal downloading			0
' ms @entity73 pointed to other countries as examples of expensive models that were not ' meaningfully addressing the problem '			0
' forcing @entity94 to monitor and prevent copyright infringement through the use of an internet filter is not the answer , ' ms @entity73 said			2
' looking at international examples , we know that the policies proposed are high - cost with low results			0
' policies like this in @entity105 and @entity106 have cost significant amounts of money			0
' our fear is that a high - cost system will lead to all consumers paying more for the internet , without meaningfully addressing the problem			2
' the advertisement coincides with a review of the government 's competition policy due out late this year where @entity60 detailed new evidence of the artificially high prices @entity32 pay for identical goods and services purchased from identical websites			0
in the 30 - second ad , the filter is seen breaking apart while the fake minister gives a rehearsed speech about its benefits this included paying 33 per cent more than @entity130 consumers for the top 10 new release movies in @entity133 ’s @entity132			1
the latest choice research came on the back of a comprehensive submission to the it pricing inquiry in 2012 , which detailed more than 200 examples of hefty mark - ups @entity32 pay on popular digital products			0
ms @entity73 said the solution to the piracy issue lay in removing the barriers that restricted @entity32 from purchasing legitimate content from the global market			0
' we should be using the pressure of genuine competition to deliver more timely and affordable content to local consumers , not punishing @entity32 and entrenching outdated business models , ' she said .			0
