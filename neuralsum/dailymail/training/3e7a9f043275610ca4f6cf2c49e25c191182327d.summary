@entity0 and @entity1 had a good life			1
they lived in a pleasant suburb about half an hour outside @entity5 , worked in jobs they enjoyed and earned enough to live comfortably			1
' we had a pretty " normal " life			2
@entity1 was a civil engineer and i owned a @entity12			2
we lived in a nice house , in a nice suburb , life was … nice			2
but " nice " was n't really cutting it for us , ' @entity0 told @entity17			2
but three years ago the pair decided to pack it all in , sell everything they owned and head overseas on an indefinite holiday			1
' when i did n't like the answers to those questions we decided to make some rather large changes to our life			0
' now they spend their days soaking up the sun in cities all around the world , travelling from place to place with no set itinerary , and @entity0 , 39 , and @entity1 , 36 , have no intentions of heading home any time soon			1
the decision was a no - brainer for the pair who already had a taste for adventure and freedom , and spent much of the time leading up to their departure researching how others who had ' quit their lives ' made it work			1
@entity0 and @entity1 run travel blog @entity72 and their work helps them to fund their travels the couple 's adventures have taken them to the @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity82 and more			1

my family moved around a lot when i was a child ; a habit i continued as an adult , @entity0 revealed from the @entity104 where she and @entity1 are currently living it up			1
' i love change , i love discovering new places , and most of all i love freedom			0
our lifestyle is all of that and so much more , ' she added			0
' making the decision to travel full time was an easy one			0
we both loved travel and we had travelled a lot more than usual before we left @entity117			0
' however , after the decision was made the hard part was the planning , the saving and the waiting , @entity0 said			2
supporting their lifestyle through their travel blog @entity127 and other business ventures , the pair have made it possible to sustain their adventures in the long term			1
' at first we had our savings but that dwindled out pretty fast , ' @entity0 said			1
' so we created an online business which allows us to work anywhere in the world as long as we have our laptops and @entity139			0
the income from the business supports our travels			0
' the pair also spend much of their time house - sitting for others , cutting their accomodation costs right down while experiencing the city they 're living in from a local 's perspective			2
the couple said making the decision to pack up their lives was not a difficult one			2
this is @entity157 in the @entity158 it came after one of @entity0 's parents passed away , which forced the couple to reevaluate their lives			1
pictured is a stunning sunset in @entity166 , @entity167 the pair spend much of their time house - sitting for others , cutting their accomodation costs right down @entity0 said it means they get to experience life from a local perpsective she describes the couple 's life as ' free , adventurous , exciting and perfect ' describing her lifestyle as ' free , adventurous , exciting and perfect ' @entity0 said the thing she loves most about the life is the adventure			1
' i have thousands of memories from all of our experiences from the last three years that i will cherish forever			0
and we are free like never before , ' she revealed			0
' yes we still work , but it ’s on our own time , on our own terms			0
we can go where we want when we want ; it does n’t get much better than that ! ' and i love that we never set an alarm clock ! , ' @entity0 added			2
so far the couple have travelled around @entity81 , the @entity79 , @entity193 , the @entity80 and @entity194 and @entity195 , the @entity158 and @entity82			1
but on the cards are many more spots they would like to explore			0
the @entity5 couple still work so they have an income but enjoy it as it 's on their own terms so far the couple have travelled around @entity81 , the @entity79 , @entity193 and the @entity80 they have also been to the @entity158 , @entity82 and are currently kicking back in the @entity104 one of the best parts of life according to @entity0 is never having to set an alarm clock she said the freedom of living life the way she and @entity1 do is almost indescribable ' i have always wanted to visit @entity214 so that is on the list and @entity1 would love to go to @entity216 at some point , ' @entity0 revealed			1
' there is n't a lot of structure because we like the freedom an open itinerary gives us			0
' however , we have an idea of where we want to go for about 3 – 6 months in advance … it just does n't always turn out the way we think it might as we have habit of changing our plans at the last minute , ' she added			0
the pair save money by cooking their own meals or jumping on flights last minute at unusual times , but their successful business is what really keeps them going			0
' it 's cheaper to fly mid week than on the weekends so if you can be flexible you can save quite a bit of money on airfares and hotels this way , ' @entity0 said			2
the pair save money by cooking their own meals or jumping on flights last minute at unusual times they live their lives without much structure or too much planning they say being flexible is the key to leading such an adventurous lifestyle the couple say they 've had no second thoughts about their decision three years on and wo n't be going home the highlight of @entity0 's travels so far was the moment she stepped foot in a city she had yearned to visit for most of her life			1
' i would have to say our visit to @entity93 was very surreal			0
i had been dreaming of traveling there since i was 10 years old when we had @entity93 students stay with us , ' @entity0 said			1
' i was fascinated by the stories they told , by their culture and way of life			0
so the day we arrived in @entity94 was a moment @entity280 never forget			0
' when asked if there had been any point in the past three years which made them question their drastic life change , @entity0 said she could n't think of one			1
' no , as much as our family would love to hear that we are coming back , even for a visit , soon , we have n’t had any thoughts about returning yet			0
