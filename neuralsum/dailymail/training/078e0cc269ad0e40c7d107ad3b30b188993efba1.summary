in a statement to @entity160 , the @entity162 assistant secretary @entity161 said : ' @entity163 is always a last resort for our staff , and cell extractions are typically done to keep inmates from harming themselves or others and to ensure that they are placed in a more appropriate mental health setting			0
' what you do nâ€™t see on these videos is the hours of discussions that take place between the inmate and clinical staff before a cell extraction is ordered and the video camera starts rolling			0
' as we are always looking to improve our policies , @entity162 is revising use of force policies to limit the duration of pepper spray applications , the total applications and the minimum waiting period between applications in non-emergency situations			0
