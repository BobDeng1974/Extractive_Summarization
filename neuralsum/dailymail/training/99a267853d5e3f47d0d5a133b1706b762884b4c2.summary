by @entity1 reporter published : 12:09 est , 7 february 2013 updated : 13:36 est , 7 february 2013 a new commuter rail concourse is being built 16 stories below @entity4 as part of a $ 15billion development			1
an army of workers is blasting through bedrock to create the shiny new area that will have more floor space than @entity13 's @entity12			0
it is one of three hidden projects going on beneath the streets of @entity18 to expand what is already the nation 's biggest mass transit system			1
even with blasting and machinery grinding through the rock day and night , most @entity18 are unaware of the construction below ground that includes a massive , eight - story cavern , miles of tunnels and watery , gravel - filled pits			1
engineer @entity48 , president of capital construction for the state @entity50 said : ' i look at it and i 'm in wonder , i 'm in awe			0
' i feel like when i went to @entity56 and entered @entity57 for the first time			0
i looked at it and said , " wow , how did they do that ? " ' in @entity18 , they hauled out so much rocky debris from under @entity4 that it could have covered @entity64 almost a foot deep , @entity48 says			1
together , the three projects will cost an estimated $ 15 billion			1
and when they 're all completed , estimated for 2019 , they will bring subway and commuter rail service to vast , underserved stretches of the city , particularly the far @entity73 and @entity74 sides of @entity76			1
' they 'll be a game - changer for @entity18 , ' says @entity48			1
it will accommodate @entity81 trains that now bypass @entity76 's @entity82 as they roll east through @entity84 and straight to @entity85 on the island 's @entity86			0
this so - called @entity88 will bring about 160,000 passengers a day from @entity90 to a new station in @entity84 ' @entity93 neighborhood , then about five more miles to the new , eight - track @entity4 hub			1
it is currently a construction site about five football pitches long			0
the @entity98 is kicking in $ 2.7 billion toward the estimated $ 8.3 billion budget , with the @entity50 state agency covering the rest using mostly taxpayer money			2
crews have carved out tunnels and were preparing to lay down concrete on the construction of the @entity25 hundreds of workers are busy underground but are barely noticed by @entity18 above also under construction is the @entity25 that eventually will serve @entity76 's far @entity82 , from @entity109 to the island 's southern tip. the planned eight miles of track will open @entity76 's @entity82 to millions of people who now squeeze daily onto the @entity115 4 , 5 and 6 subway trains running under @entity35			1
dubbed the ' @entity116 , ' the @entity25 has been a @entity18 dream since the 1920s			1
then came the @entity119 and @entity120 , followed by lack of funds that stopped the project after several stretches of tunnel with tracks were built in the 1970s			2
the existing tunnels are now being incorporated into the new ones			2
the first phase - 1.7 miles with stations between @entity73 96th streets - is to be completed in 2016 at a cost of $ 4.5 billion			1
funding and plans for the rest of the route are still up in the air			0
finally , there 's the extension of the no. 7 subway line from @entity141 to a huge new real estate development on @entity76 's @entity143 , @entity18 's biggest besides the @entity144			1
it 's called @entity146 , a small urban village of high - rises , parkland , retail businesses and cultural institutions in the @entity152			0
@entity153 calls this subway extension - financed through $ 2.1billion worth of city - issued bonds - ' a key milestone towards attracting development			1
' ' these are vital projects , and they 'll reinforce the infrastructure of the city , ' says @entity163 , director of the @entity164 at @entity165			0
' it 's not just about people going to work ; the @entity18 subway and rail systems are busy 24 hours a day , taking people shopping , to theaters , to clubs			1
' the city 's 468 subway stations register more than 1.6billion rides a year			2
the system is used by more than 5 million daily riders			2
the @entity178 in @entity179 , has about 800,000 , and @entity181 's @entity180 has about 400,000			0
the three mammoth projects require creative solutions and the latest technology			0
the artist 's impression of the new concourse is a far cry from the average @entity18 subway when crews prepared to drill the giant new cavity under @entity193 , they first had to freeze the ground to about minus 20 degrees so as not to destabilize the buildings above as the boring machine cut through			1
for that , aluminum tubes were inserted from the street and a special chemical solution was poured into the ground and cooled by a refrigeration plant			0
the @entity193 tunnels hold a space - age surprise : the ceilings are coated with a material once used to fireproof the space shuttle			2
the new line has another major improvement			0
instead of ventilation grates that allow rainwater to pour in , the new stations will be aired using enclosed cooling plants			0
when @entity215 hit the city last october , floodwaters washing over the @entity82 did not penetrate subway construction sites			2
' we 're using the best technology available today , but this is really people - intensive work , ' says @entity48 , who supervises a team of thousands of workers on any given day			2
' i feel i have the most exciting job in the world , ' he says			0
' it 's an incredible feeling to be able to build a legacy project			0
i hope that one day , my grandchildren will be able to say their granddad built this			0

work is part of $ 15billion improvements to the @entity18 subway system
a 350,000sq ft commuter concourse with six miles of tunnels will be built
engineers say improvements will be a ' game changer ' and ease congestion
