when the ballots closed he was in for a nervous wait			0
but when state media called the result , incredibly , the votes had gone @entity7 's way			1
in the true style of a despot , @entity9 's supreme leader won his first election - with an almost impossible to believe 100 per cent approval			2
after all , in a secretive one - party state like @entity9 , there was only ever going to be @entity17 winner			0
@entity9 went to the polls on sunday to approve the new roster of deputies for the @entity34 , the country 's legislature			1
the vote , more a political ritual than an election by @entity43 standards , is generally held once every five years to rubber - stamp the assembly			2
though results for the other seats in the assembly had not yet been announced , @entity9 's media quickly reported @entity7 had won in his district - located on the symbolic @entity52 - without a single dissenting ballot			1
in the previous elections , 687 deputies were chosen			0
this is first time the election had been held since @entity7 inherited power after the death of his father , @entity60 , in 2011			1
' this is an expression of all the service personnel and people 's absolute support and profound trust in supreme leader @entity7 as they single - mindedly remain loyal to him , ' the state - run @entity61 said			1
making their choice : @entity9 after casting their votes in the election of deputies to the 13th @entity34 @entity9 dancing after casting their votes in the election of deputies to the 13th @entity34 in this propaganda image , @entity9 soldiers dance after casting their votes in the election of deputies to the 13th @entity34 at @entity76 @entity77 ( left ) , the younger sister of @entity9 leader @entity7 ( right ) , arriving to cast their ballots voters in the election have no choice who to vote for - there is only one candidate 's name on the ballot for each of the 687 districts			1
instead , they have the choice of voting yes or no , and according to official accounts virtually all choose yes			0
@entity9 also typically puts turnout nationwide at over 99 per cent			0
mobile ballot boxes were created to cater to those who were ill and could not travel to balloting stations , state media reported			0
@entity9 leader @entity7 speaks to @entity98 ( left ) , director of the general @entity99 of the @entity101 a number of poems were also produced to celebrate voting under titles including ' the @entity106 ' and ' we go to polling station '			1
analysts will be closely watching to see if the deputies this time around reflect a generational change as @entity7 looks to solidify his power and replace older cadres with younger , more loyal ones			1
the @entity34 usually meets only rarely , often only once a year			1
in practice it has little power and when it is not in session , its work is done by a smaller and more powerful body called the @entity121			0
the new parliament was expected to meet next month			0
no date has been officially announced			0
the election comes after @entity9 's second-most powerful man reappeared on tv , contradicting reports that he may have been purged from the isolated nation 's leadership			0
@entity98 was seen close to the country 's leader @entity7 in pictures taken in the past couple of months , smiling but sporting a limp			2

@entity7 won every ballot cast by voters in his district
he ran uncontested in the first elections to the @entity34
this is first time elections have been held since @entity7 inherited power
