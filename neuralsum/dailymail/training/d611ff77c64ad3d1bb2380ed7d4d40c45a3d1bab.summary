by @entity0 published : 05:06 est , 16 october 2013 updated : 05:08 est , 16 october 2013 five million babies have now been born worldwide with the help of fertility treatment - half of them in the last six years			1
the first ‘ test tube baby ’ , @entity10 , was born in 1978 and by 1990 there had been an estimated 90,000 births resulting from assisted reproductive technology ( @entity8 ) worldwide			1
by 2000 , the figure stood at an estimated 900,000			1
the first ' test tube baby ' , @entity10 , was born in july 1978 at @entity12			1
she is pictured with her parents and the nurses who cared for her since 2000 , the number of births resulting from fertility treatment has rocketed and by 2007 it was estimated that more than 2.5 million children had been born using assisted reproductive technology			1
since 2007 , it is believed that about 2.5 million babies have been born following fertility treatment , bringing the total to date to about five million , according to a report by the @entity25 for the @entity26			1
@entity27 , from the @entity28 said : ‘ this comprehensive report confirms that we now have over five million babies born through assisted reproduction			1
‘ more than that , it shows that half of them have been born in the last six years			2
‘ the number of babies born through @entity8 is now about the same as the population of a @entity42 state such as @entity43 , or a country such as @entity45 or @entity46			2
this is a great medical success story			0
’ @entity47 was pioneered by sir @entity48 , who died earlier this year , and by dr @entity49			0
since 2007 , about 2.5 million ' test tube babies ' have been born			1
@entity10 ( right with her son , @entity51 ) is pictured with sir @entity48 , one of the pioneers of @entity47 , and her mother , @entity10 their technique led to the birth of @entity10 on july 25 , 1978 , at @entity12			1
the treatment involved an egg being removed from one of her mother ’s ovaries with a probe before being mixed with her father ’s sperm in a petri dish – not a test tube			1
the resulting embryo was implanted in mrs @entity10 ’s womb two days later			1
mrs @entity10 was not the first woman to become pregnant after @entity47 treatment , but none of the previous pregnancies had lasted for more than a few weeks			2
now , about 180,000 @entity47 babies are born in @entity76 each year			2
following each cycle of @entity47 , a woman under the age of 35 has a 32 per cent chance of conceiving , a 35 to 37 - year - old has a 28 per cent chance , a 38 to 39 - year - old has a 21 per cent chance and a 40 to 42 - year - old has a 14 per cent chance			0
in vitro fertilisation ( @entity47 ) is one of several techniques available to help couples with fertility problems to have a baby			2
during @entity47 , an egg is surgically removed from the woman 's ovaries and fertilised with sperm in a laboratory			0
the fertilised egg , now called an embryo , is then returned to the woman 's womb to grow and develop			0
an ivf cycle starts with a woman being given drugs to suppress her menstrual cycle			0
once this has happened , she is given a fertility hormone called @entity108 which increases the number of eggs the ovaries produce			0
the eggs will then be collected by using a needle to remove them from the ovaries			0
the eggs are then mixed with sperm in a laboratory and any fertilised eggs are left for a few days before being transferred into the womb			0
currently , women under 40 are offered three cycles of @entity47 treatment on the @entity122 if they have been trying to get pregnant for more than two years or if they have not been able to get pregnant after 12 cycles of artificial insemination			0
women aged between 40 and 42 are offered one cycle of @entity47 on the @entity122 if they have been trying for a baby for two years , if they have never had ivf before , if they show no evidence of low ovarian reserve and if they have been informed of the risks of @entity47 and pregnancy at their age			0
following each cycle of @entity47 , a woman under the age of 35 has a 32 per cent chance of conceiving , a 35 to 37 - year - old has a 28 per cent chance , a 38 to 39 - year - old has a 21 per cent chance and a 40 to 42 - year - old has a 14 per cent chance .			0
