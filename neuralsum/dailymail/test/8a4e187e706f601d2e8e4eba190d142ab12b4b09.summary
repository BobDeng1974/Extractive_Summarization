it is one of the most dangerous sports in the world and one in every 15 bull rides ends in an injury of some sort			1
but that is n't enough to stop hundreds of child riders , some as young as seven , from taking the hot seat each year			1
among them is @entity12 , 10 , from @entity13 in @entity14 , who has proved so successful that he was crowned world champion in his age group last year			1
bouncing around : a young bull rider takes on a bullock ( steer ) at a rodeo in @entity13 , @entity14 but each time he gets on a bullock , a castrated male , he risks life and limb , and has already been trampled on several times			1
that , however , is not enough to stop his father @entity30 , himself a former bull rider , from entering @entity12 , his older brother @entity31 , 15 , and his sister @entity33 , seven , into competitions all over the @entity35			1
' it ’s about taking chances and these kids , that ’s what they ’re doing , ' he explains in an interview with @entity43 's @entity42			1
' they ’re taking chances and as parents we ’re taking a chance			2
this is a very dangerous sport and you ca n’t take it kiddish and [ be ] playing around because that ’s when you can get hurt			2
' bull riding is a multi-billion dollar industry in the @entity35 and events staged by the @entity55 , the professional bull riders ' association , are watched by up to half a billion people around the world each year			1
ouch ! most bull riders are speedily thrown off - a good result is eight seconds hitting the deck : an estimated one in 15 bull rides across all age groups ends in injury of some sort starting small : the youngest children hone their skills on sheep before graduating to calves but as the stakes get higher , pressure to breed bulls that are more athletic , more vicious and bigger than ever before has increased - including in the junior division			1
for @entity76 , a former bull riding world champion , it is becoming too dangerous			1
' you take a young teenage boy and put him on a bull that ’s got a massive pedigree , ' he explains			1
' it would be kind of like putting a young 13 , 14 year old footballer against an @entity85 player			2
it ’s just not even			2
' another young bull - rider , 16 - year - old @entity87 , who has been knocked out several times by oversized bulls , agrees			1
' the breeding system nowadays is getting so intense and so hard - core , it ’s not even realistic			0
' the more stuff they breed and the more stuff they do , it ’s making bucking harder and harder			0
' that , however , is n't enough to quell the @entity98 's enthusiasm			0
all three children started when they were barely more than toddlers , honing their skills on sheep in a sport known colloquially as ' mutton throwing '			1
not happy : even the calves , such as the one pictured , can pack a hefty punch if enraged moving on : the next step is to ride bullocks ( castrated young males ) before culminating in big bulls tough task : @entity113 , who are often approaching the size of a full - grown female , are no easy ride now seven , @entity33 , the youngest , has graduated onto calves while @entity12 takes on bullocks and @entity31 wrangles bulls			1
but of all the @entity122 children , it is @entity12 who takes the sport most seriously , training for two hours a day , every day , in a bid to achieve his ambition of becoming a @entity55 rider			2
he has also suffered several injuries			0
' i was hanging upside down and next thing you know i was on the ground , ' he recalls			0
' determined not to show his family up , the 10 - year - old says he managed to hold back his tears until he left the arena			0
' most of all the things that daddy says is : do n’t cry in the arena , ' he explains			0
' i cried in the back pen			0
' despite the hard work and the injuries , @entity12 's fledgling career has proved lucrative , with the boy earning an impressive $ 5,000 last year			0
big guns : teenagers begin with small bulls but , should they make professional , graduate onto big ones aggressive : bulls bred for rodeo are becoming increasingly large and athletic this money is being put towards paying for college and @entity30 could n't be more proud			2
' i think he feels the pressure he puts on himself , ' he says			0
' you know the pressure of wanting to win , wanting to be number one			0
i always tell him i ’m going to throw you to the wolves , you either come back leading the pack or you get eaten			0
' he ’s always been one of the smaller guys			0
it ’s something to kind of motivate him , pump him up			0
' he does , however , worry about the increasingly large bulls involved			2
' @entity12 has eight more years before he can even think about riding here [ in the main arena ] , ' he says			2
' just think if these bulls are bucking this hard and are this rank right now , what are they going to be like in eight years when he ’s there ? ' if it continues the way it is , the sport of rodeo the way it is , it ’ll no longer be a bull riding , it will be just a bull bucking competition			1
it ’s all about money			0

children as young as seven can take part in bull riding competitions
youngest children ride calves before graduating to bullocks then bulls
