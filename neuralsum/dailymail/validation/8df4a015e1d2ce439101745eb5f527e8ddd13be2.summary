@entity0 may be known for its cars , but at this year ’s @entity3 the auto giant also unveiled a pair of electric bikes			1
both prototypes are powered by 200 - watt motors , fold to fit on a train or in the boot of a car , and with pedal assist , help riders reach speeds of up to 15mph ( 25km/h )			1
the bikes are part of an experiment by @entity0 called @entity17 , which aims to make journeys safer and more efficient			1
@entity0 unveiled two prototype electric bikes at @entity3 in @entity20			1
both the @entity21 : me ( pictured ) and @entity21 : @entity23 are powered by 200 - watt motors , fold to fit on a train or in the boot of a car , and with pedal assist they help riders reach speeds of up to 15mph ( 25km/h ) they are also part of the company 's wider @entity31 plan , which is designed to make cars and other vehicles more connected			1
the bikes , called @entity21 : me and @entity21 : @entity23 , are based on designs by @entity0 employees and take inspiration from technology seen in cars			1
for example , both bikes are fitted with rear - facing ultrasonic sensors			1
these sensors link with the handlebars to discreetly alert the rider when a car is about to overtake using subtle vibrations			1
the @entity21 : me e-bike ( pictured ) was designed for commuters ‘ to keep moving in congested city traffic ’			0
it folds and stows easily , allowing commuters to park outside the city , for example , take the e-bike onto public transport or a car and travel to the centre , then ride the e-bike to their destination both bikes have a slot for an @entity63 so an app can be used as a sat - van ( pictured left ) and show when a car is about to overtake ( pictured right ) , thanks to rear - facing ultrasonic sensors in the bike 's frame earlier this week @entity0 unveiled its latest app that not only shows how far you can travel on the power you have remaining on an electric car , but bases its predictions on your unique driving style			1
called @entity77 , it also lets drivers remotely access their vehicles meaning they can set the cabin temperature on a cold morning before they leave their house			0
the app was announced at @entity3 in @entity20 and currently works with a selection of @entity0 ’s electric and hybrid cars			2
it specifically suits electric cars because the app can directly link to the battery to see a status level and accurate mileage			2
but @entity0 spokesman @entity91 told @entity92 the team is working on developing the software for petrol and diesel range			0
these handlebars also light up to make the bikes more visible to motorists			2
the @entity21 : me e-bike – built with the help of bicycle manufacturer @entity102 - is designed for commuters ‘ to keep moving in congested city traffic ’			2
it folds and stows easily , allowing commuters to park outside the city , for example , take the e-bike onto public transport and travel to the centre , then ride the e-bike to their destination			0
meanwhile , the @entity21 : pro e-bike – built by a @entity0 team – is intended for commercial use by couriers , electricians , and goods and delivery services			2
it is designed to stow safely into commercial vehicles which can act as carrier and support vehicle , and be combined with more than one e-bike			0
both prototypes work with an called @entity21 : link , which is currently only compatible with the @entity63			1
this app acts as a sat - nav and sends vibrations to the handlebars so the rider knows when to change direction			1
turn signals are then triggered automatically for safety			0
the app also finds bike - friendly roads , hazards and alerts , and could ‘ communicate ’ with other vehicles			0
the @entity21 : pro e-bike ( pictured ) – built by a @entity0 team – is intended for commercial use by couriers , electricians , and goods and delivery services it is designed to stow safely into commercial vehicles which can act as carrier and support vehicle , and be combined with more than one e-bike			2
both prototypes work with an called @entity21 : link , which is currently only compatible with the @entity63 6 its multimodal navigation and smart routing lets riders filter journeys based on cost , time , and the amount of cycling required , compared to driving			1
this map also shows the weather , parking costs and charging stations			0
the electric pedal assist rate can be adjusted based on a cyclist 's heart rate and includes a ‘ @entity175 ’ mode that takes over when requested , meaning the rider can cool down before arriving at their destination			0
‘ there are so many ways to get around a city , but what is really needed is a way to connect all of these transport options together , ’ said @entity176 , vice president , @entity177 and @entity178			0
‘ being able to seamlessly move between cars , buses , trains and e-bikes and react to changing traffic situations can make a big difference both for commuters and for those delivering goods , services and healthcare			0
’ there are no immediate plans to release the bikes but @entity0 said they will help test alternative transportation ideas			0
an accompanying app acts as a sat - nav ( pictured ) and sends vibrations to the handlebars so the rider knows when to change direction			2
turn signals are then triggered automatically for safety			0

the electric bikes by @entity0 are called @entity21 : me and @entity21 : pro
both are powered by 200 - watt motors and are foldable to fit in cars
@entity216 - facing sensors warn a cyclist when a car is overtaking
the bikes link to @entity21 : link app , which offers navigation features
vibrations in the handlebars tell the rider which direction to turn
bikes are part of an experiment by @entity0 called handle on *mobility* aiming to make journeys safer and more efficient
