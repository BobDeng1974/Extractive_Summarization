it is billed as ' an apartment in the sky ' and features an 84 inch double bed with @entity5 cotton sheets , full turn down service , seats made from the same leather as a @entity9 and an in - flight chef			1
but the icing on the cake for passengers willing to dish out £ 12,500 for the privilege to fly in @entity15 , @entity17 's brand new uber luxe three - room cabin , must surely be the personal butler to cater for their every whim - from full valeting a la @entity19 to pre-booking them a restaurant or hotel for their arrival			1
hand - picked from a selection of the nation 's best service industry professionals , the airline has employed 13 butlers , each of whom under went a specially tailored training course in at the @entity33 , and the @entity34 , under the watchful eye of its head butler , @entity36			1
one of two newly trained female butlers , @entity38 , 28 , from @entity39 , spoke to @entity40 about what it entails to be one of the world 's first flying butlers ... rigorous training : @entity38 recieving a certificate from the @entity34 's @entity48 @entity36 ' i do love @entity19 , but nowadays i would describe butlers as being lifestyle managers			1
you are there to think for the guests , you 're like a pa			1
you ’re doing a bit of everything , ' @entity38 says			2
the job starts from the moment a customer books their ticket			0
' the guests will be contacted and we will build a profile on them – dining requests , beverage requests , the reason for their travel			1
it might be a special occasion , it might be a once - in - a - lifetime trip for them , or it could be a business trip			1
' we need to be able to read the guests			1
some might want the full dining experience , some will want to maximise their rest time , so we need to understand			1
' @entity78 carrier @entity17 has employed 13 butlers , each of whom under went a specially tailored training course the butlers learned everything from sewing and flower arranging to how to perfectly pack a suitcase the @entity89 guests will receive tailor - made treatment			1
as as well as free reign over the first class menu , they will be able to build on it , with a spot of caviar and afternoon tea , for instance			0
if they fancy a cocktail and canape reception , then that is what they 'll have			0
@entity38 describes the training as strict and thorough			2
at the university , lecturer @entity105 , known for training service professionals who have gone on to work at @entity109 taught the fledgeling butlers all of her trade secrets			1
' she went through the valeting process with us : from sewing and flower arranging to how to polish shoes - everything a butler needs to know			2
' ' we even learnt how to pack a suitcase properly			0
that sounds like an easy task , but when a butler does it , it involves a lot of tissue paper			0
it ends up looking like a present when you open the case			0
' he ’s been doing it a long time and his eye for detail is unbelievable , ' she says and at the @entity34 hotel , @entity38 and her colleagues met @entity48 @entity36			0
' he is very strict , but he gets the best out of people			0
he ’s been doing it a very long time and his eye for detail is unbelievable			0
' for example , in a guests bedroom , they take pictures of things so they know where people have left them			2
so when guests come back in , it looks like their items have never been moved			1
' the devil is certainly in the detail for @entity17 's butlers			1
@entity38 says : ' something we picked up in @entity157 was knowing whether someone is left or right handed , so we always know where to put their drink down			2
guests will have a tailor - made food experience including caviar , afternoon tea , cocktails and canapes en - suite shower room : customers in @entity15 are referred to as ' guests ' rather than passengers ' we kept a diary of our time in @entity157 and everything down to our posture , the way we dressed and the service language we were using improved			1
' ' we learned the correct way to speak to guests , such as using " may i ? " rather than " can i ? " ' the favourite word is " splendid "			1
while " ok " is not to be used			0
' we should never use the word " no " - there is always something you can do , even at 40,000 feet , you can always think of something			2
' ' we have no " passengers " , they are " guests "			2
it ’s about hospitality , bringing that hotel feel onto the aircraft			0
the airline 's £ 12,500 vip suite has already sold out for its first ten flights , which will begin next month style and image at @entity17 is very important			1
the butlers have a strict code when it comes to their appearance ' style and image at @entity17 are very important			1
we learned how to groom ourselves to a very high standard			0
' we have three shades of eye shadow , wear red lipstick , and have a @entity208 manicure			0
men need to be very clean shaven and have polished shoes and perfect uniform			0
you have to look absolutely immaculate			0
' every day we had an inspection , the trainers were very strict with us , checking our appearance and the way stood			2
plush : the residence features an 84 double inch bed with @entity5 cotton sheets and full turn down service ' the vital thing is the ' magic box ’ - we all have one			1
we all have different things in our magic boxes , our little tricks to avoid having to say no to our guests			1
' on an aircraft , you ca n’t just run down to @entity231 , and pick something up , you need to have things available to you			0
i have everything down to fake eyelashes in mine			0
' as a crew we ask how far can we wow people on flights and create memorable moments			0
' we can provide their favourite flowers and even the soft furnishings can be personalised			0
' is there anything a butler would n't do ? ' obviously we draw the line at anything that breeches security or that is illegal – we ca n’t say yes to everything and you are on an aircraft as well , safety is paramount , ' @entity38 says			0
' but as far the service side of things goes , i do everything i can to make sure guests have a very special experience			2

thirteen butlers were hand - picked to serve the airline 's most *affluent* fliers
all *underwent* same rigorous training as staff at @entity109
everything from posture , appearance and speech was honed to perfection
words such as ' splendid ' are *encouraged* , while ' no ' and ' ok ' are forbidden
butlers have ' magic box ' full of items to ensure guests have all they need
