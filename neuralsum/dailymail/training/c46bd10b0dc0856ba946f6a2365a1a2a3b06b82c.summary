@entity1 president @entity0 has today apologised for his controversial comments on racism in football after @entity5 and @entity6 waded into the row			1
the under - fire head of football 's world governing body said he was sorry - but was adamant he would not resign from his role			2
speaking to the @entity13 , the 75 - year - old said : ' it hurts and i am still hurting because i could n't envisage such a reaction			0
' @entity17 : @entity0 posted this picture of him hugging @entity19 's black football chief @entity20 in 2009 which has only fuelled the racism row ' when you have done something which was not totally correct , i can only say i am sorry for all those people affected by my declarations			1
' despite people from the world of politics and football calling for @entity0 to step down , he said he had no intention of resigning			2
' i can not resign			0
why should i ? when you are faced with a problem you have to face the problem			0
to leave would be totally unfair and not compatible with my fighting spirit , my character , my energy			0
' criticism : @entity5 described @entity0 's comments as ' appalling ' and said some things ' ca n't just be sorted out with just a hand shake ' his apology comes after former @entity43 captain @entity5 and the prime minister both waded into the row strongly condemning the @entity1 president 's comments			1
it follows a picture being posted on the @entity1 website of 75 - year - old @entity0 hugging black @entity19 football chief @entity20 as he tried to back - track from his claim there is no racism in football			1
this morning , @entity57 player @entity5 echoed the prime minister 's condemnation yesterday , describing the comments as ' appalling ' and said some things ' ca n't just be sorted out with just a hand shake '			1
the former @entity43 captain insisted the statement had been damaging to the sport			1
the @entity1 president also became embroiled in an amazing @entity67 row with @entity68 , who accused him of being ' ignorant '			1
mr @entity6 said : ' it 's appalling to suggest that racism in any way should be accepted as part of the game			2
' a lot of work has gone into ridding racism from all aspects of our society , including football			0
as many of our top sports stars have rightly pointed out , now is not the time for complacency			0
' meanwhile , the airline @entity86 told @entity88 they may not renew their Â£ 122million @entity1 sponsorship deal when it expires in 2014			1
emirates are one of @entity1 's six official partners and are concerned their brand has been damaged by @entity0 's remarks and the widespread outrage and offence he has caused			1
@entity0 dismissed racism as a problem on the football field , arguing that any such incident should be settled with a handshake at the end of the game			2
@entity20 appeared to defend @entity0 at a news conference in @entity104 today he compounded the situation by comparing racist abuse to foul play			2
' it 's foul language , it 's foul play , ' he said			2
an @entity86 spokesman said yesterday : ' @entity86 continues to closely watch developments within @entity1 ahead of discussions on the extension of our partnership beyond 2014			2
however , we have no role in the management of the organisation			0
' the @entity123 - based airline had previosuly expressed concern about its relationship with @entity1 in the wake of the cash - for - votes scandal			2
@entity128 , the @entity86 vice-president , said : ' we are seriously thinking about not renewing our partnership with @entity1 beyond 2014			2
we do n't get into politics but we believe the situation with @entity1 went beyond an internal problem and became much bigger			2
' go now : @entity133 prime minister @entity6 ( left ) with @entity0 outside @entity134 earlier this year @entity0 's friend is @entity20 , known as @entity20 , after @entity137 's capital city , because of his love of martial arts			1
why does deal with the @entity1 president ? sexwale is the minister of human settlements in @entity19 and worked with @entity1 on projects to highlight the battle against racism and apartheid			1
why does he do that ? he went into self - imposed exile to the @entity149 to fight apartheid but was charged with conspiracy to overthrow the government when he returned in 1976			0
he was sentenced to 18 years on @entity154 , where he met his wife			0
he was released in 1990 and served under @entity157 as the premier of @entity160 province			0
anything else ? he owns @entity162 , the world 's third biggest diamond company , and hosted @entity19 's version of @entity165			0
at this stage @entity1 's five other partners - @entity166 , @entity167 , @entity168 , @entity169 and @entity170 - have chosen not to condemn @entity0 's comments , even though they were invited to by @entity173			1
they did make their stance against racism clear			0
but it could be the fear of losing major sponsors that threatens @entity0 's position more than the criticism he continued to receive yesterday , even though it came from some hugely influential figures in football			1
most staggering was the @entity67 exchange with @entity183 's @entity68			1
his younger brother @entity184 is at the centre of the @entity187 race inquiry and @entity68 attacked @entity0 on wednesday night for posting a picture alongside a statement on the @entity1 website of himself with a black football official and @entity19 politician			1
in an unprecedented move by @entity0 , he responded directly to @entity68			1
' the " black man " as you call him has a name : @entity20			0
he has done tremendous work against racism and apartheid in @entity19			0
' @entity68 tweeted back : ' to say what you said about racism in football spoke volumes of your ignorance to the subject			2
' having suddenly found himself a pawn in the race storm , @entity20 held a press conference in @entity104 today , at which he seemed to support @entity0 , saying : ' we should distinguish racial remarks from things that are said when players are fighting for a ball			2
' as @entity6 made his comments increasing the pressure on @entity0 from @entity220 , mr @entity217 echoed his sentiments saying : ' @entity0 's comments are completely unacceptable			1
action man : prime minister @entity6 took time out from meeting @entity225 and @entity226 at the @entity228 factory in @entity229 to condemn @entity0 @entity0 rioferdy5 the ' black man ' as you call him has a name : @entity20			1
he has done tremendous work against racism and apartheid in @entity19 ... we have done several joint activities to raise awareness on the struggle against racism in @entity19 ... @entity1 has a long standing and proud record in the area of anti-discrimination which will continue ... @entity0 's total followers 191,681 @entity68 @entity246 to say what you said about racism in football spoke volumes of your ignorance to the subject ... i guess you now have the full support of all the women , gay community + people against racism in football ... if we want 2 stamp out racism in society a football pitch is a good place to start - loved by billions of people around the world ... @entity268 's total followers 1,643,977 ' this is the latest episode that calls into question whether this man should be the head of world football			1
for the sake of the game , he should go			0
' while the @entity279 and the @entity280 reiterated their stance against racism , there was no direct attack on @entity0			1
but @entity68 was joined by a number of @entity279 managers in criticising @entity0			1
@entity286 , @entity287 and @entity288 were united in their feelings , with @entity288 calling the @entity1 chief 's comments ' outrageous '			1
@entity294 chief executive @entity293 says @entity0 's remarks were ' the straw which broke the camel 's back ' and that he should step aside for @entity300 president @entity299			1
@entity133 's @entity1 vice-president @entity301 said he had been surprised by the comments but stressed both @entity1 and @entity300 had done much to combat racism in football			1
@entity301 said : ' i was very surprised to hear the president 's remarks but have been pleased that both he and @entity1 have come out to try and clarify the situation			1
' the controversy started when @entity0 was asked directly by a @entity311 reporter if racism exists on the pitch , @entity0 denied it and said such incidents should simply be settled by a handshake at the end of the match			2
' i would deny it , ' he said			0
' there is no racism , there is maybe one of the players towards another , he has a word or a gesture which is not the correct one , but also the one who is affected by that , he should say that this is a game			0
' we are in a game , and at the end of the game , we shake hands , and this can happen			0
' on the field of play sometimes you say something that is not very correct , but then at the end of the game you have the next game where you can behave better			0
' war of words : @entity68 and @entity0 were rowing over the comments on @entity67 yesterday @entity67 row : @entity68 and @entity0 were at logger heads on @entity67 over the @entity1 bosses comments spat : @entity0 defended the photo saying @entity20 ' has done tremendous work against racism in @entity19 ' to a reporter from @entity354 he simply compounded the situation			1
' during a match you may say something to somebody who is not exactly looking like you , ' he said			0
' but at the end ... it 's forgotten			0
' he later released a statement saying : ' i would like to make it very clear , i am committed to the fight against racism and any type of discrimination in football and in society			0
' i have been personally leading this battle against racism in football , which @entity1 has been fighting against throughout the past years through campaigns in all of our competitions such as the ' say no to racism ' campaign			2
' i also know that racism unfortunately continues to exist in football , and i have never denied this			0
' my comments have been misunderstood			0
what i wanted to express is that , as football players , during a match , you have ' battles ' with your opponents , and sometimes things are done which are wrong			0
but , normally , at the end of the match , you apologise to your opponent if you had a confrontation during the match , you shake hands , and when the game is over , it is over			0
' anyone who has played a football match , or a match in any sport , knows that this is the case			0
