by @entity0 published : 17:11 est , 2 february 2013 updated : 06:16 est , 3 february 2013 @entity1 has played the archetypal romantic fop so many times that even he jokes that he has only got one string to his bow			0
but now the @entity7 star has proved his critics wrong by taking on no fewer than six wildly different roles in his new film , @entity10			1
@entity1 looks unrecognisable as many of the characters , especially as the head of a murderous cannibal tribe that terrorises a post-apocalyptic @entity15			2
scroll down to watch the trailer killer look : @entity1 plays six roles in the film @entity10 , including cannibal tribesman @entity20 , which required two hours in makeup pillaging : @entity1 , who also plays the manager of a futuristic diner , said he reveled in the chance to do some ' pillaging and throat - slitting ' in the film it took two hours every day to transform an actor best known for playing stuttering upper - class romantic leads into the ‘ spectacularly evil ’ @entity20 , with terrifying body paint and tattoos			1
@entity1 , 52 , said : ‘ i was quite intrigued by the story , which is brilliant , but i would have done it just for the chance to be cannibal chief who does a lot of pillaging and throat - slitting			1
' there was n’t much throat - slitting in @entity41			1
’ @entity1 also plays a 19th century clergyman , the sinister boss of a nuclear plant , a hotel ‘ heavy ’ , an elderly publisher who breaks out of a tyrannical care home , and the manager of a futuristic diner			1
the plot comprises six interlinked storylines spanning more than 500 years , and most actors in the film – including @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 and @entity56 star @entity55 – play different characters in the various strands			1
not so suave : @entity1 , playing care home @entity60 , left , is most well - known for his rom - com roles @entity1 quipped : ‘ when they offered me these parts i thought , “ yes , i can show people i have got more strings to my bow than just one			2
” but a ) i was wrong and b ) it ’s just sitting in make - up having plastic applied to your face for hours			0
’ but the star said playing the cannibal had been his favourite , joking : ‘ i ’ve kept the costume			2
i slip into it sometimes of an evening just to watch the telly			0
i feel comfortable like that			0
’ his transformations were so convincing that co-star @entity81 – who appeared alongside @entity1 in @entity82 – said he realised it was @entity1 only when the actor swore at him			0
true to type : as nuclear plant boss @entity86 , @entity1 is back to his usual self the £ 65 million adaptation of novelist @entity91 ’s 2004 epic is the most expensive independent movie ever , but has divided opinion			1
it earned a ten - minute standing ovation at last year ’s @entity96 , but some critics have accused the film – which runs for almost three hours – of rambling			0
however , several reviewers singled out @entity1 for praise , and one said he was ‘ clearly having a blast ’ playing the villains			0
@entity10 opens in the @entity105 on february 22 .			0
