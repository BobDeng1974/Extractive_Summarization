various types of renewable energy such as solar and wind are often touted as being the solution to the world ’s growing energy crisis			1
but one researcher has come up with a novel idea that could trump them all - a biological solar panel that works around the clock			1
by harnessing the electrons generated by plants such as moss , he said he can create useful energy that could be used at home or elsewhere			1
a @entity18 scientist has revealed his green source of energy			1
by using just moss he is able to generate enough power to run a clock ( shown )			1
he said panels of plant material could power appliances in our homes			1
and the technology could help farmers grow crops where electricity is scarce dr @entity33 will present his research as part of the @entity36 , which is running from 18 to 20 may in 50 cities across nine countries			1
his idea is relatively simple - by wiring up plants to an electro - chemical system , he is able to harness the waste electrons and energy produced during the photosynthesis process			2
and the results are surprisingly efficient			2
he demonstrated how a smartphone - sized block of moss could be used to power a digital clock			1
the pint of science festival is taking place from monday 18 to wednesday 20 may 2015			0
it sees scientists of various disciplines give talks in pubs around the world , with topics ranging from the brain to space , that the public can attend for £ 3 - the ‘ price of a pint ’			0
dr @entity33 , with his moss - powered clock , is one of the scientists taking part			1
this year more than 600 science evenings will take place in 50 cities across nine countries			0
cities in the @entity74 include @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 and @entity78			0
a full schedule can be found on their website			0
an @entity83 - sized area of leaves - about 93 square inches ( 600 square centimetres ) - could charge four aa batteries in one hour on a typical sunny day			0
dr @entity33 said his inspiration came from the movie @entity89			0
‘ in that movie , they try to generate electrical energy , power , from humans , ’ he explained			1
‘ and although it was a bit crude , the concept is actually correct			0
‘ but there are perhaps less ethical issues if you take electrons from photosynthetic organisms than humans			0
’ the apparatus required is also relatively simple - cables , some water and a plant			2
at the moment , dr @entity33 is trying to find a way to increase the ‘ flux ’ of electrons emitted by a plant , making more energy available			1
‘ if we can crack this , we can get a very large flux of electrons coming out , then we can build a biological solar panel , ’ he told @entity113			0
dr @entity33 said his inspiration came from the 1999 movie @entity89			0
‘ in that movie , they try to generate electrical energy , power , from humans , ’ he explained , shown in this image from the movie			1

the ultimate goal is to develop panels that generate five watts per square metre ( 11 square ft )			1
by comparison , a solar panel generates 150 to 200 watts per square metre dr @entity33 presented his research at a preview of the @entity36 ( left )			0
he is adamant that regular moss ( stock image right ) could provide an additional source of renewable energy to complement others that are available for example , he said people could have one of these panels on the roof of their house to power certain appliances in their home			1
the goal is to generate up to five watts per square metre ( 11 square feet )			2
by comparison , a solar panel generates 150 to 200 watts per square metre			0
the uses are not just in the home , though			0
dr @entity33 said in regions where people do n’t have access to energy , biological solar panels could be useful for tasks such as growing crops			1
people could be shown how to build the simple systems and , unlike solar panels which require technical expertise to fix , the biological solar panels can be fixed easily			2
‘ to assemble one is not too difficult , ’ he explained			0
and to demonstrate just how useful the technology can be , dr @entity33 is gearing up to deploy a plant - powered system in @entity180			2
a trap camera powered by moss will be installed in the next four to eight weeks , and ultimately the same camera could be used to capture images of animals in the wild			2
rice farming is one area dr @entity33 sees his technology being useful			0
it could help power technology in areas where electricity is scarce , possibly increasing yields			1
shown is a stock image of rice paddy fields in @entity199 , one region dr @entity33 said his technology could be useful he noted that there are limitations : the technology is not very mobile , and its power output is low compared to other renewable energies			2
nonetheless he thinks it could be part of a ‘ portfolio of renewable technology ’ to generate electricity			1
‘ we do n’t really think the world is going to be powered by this technology , but it could play a role , ’ he said .			0
