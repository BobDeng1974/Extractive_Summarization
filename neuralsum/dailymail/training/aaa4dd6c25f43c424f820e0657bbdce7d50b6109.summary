by @entity0 two @entity2 terrorists who plotted to kill thousands of innocent people in bomb attacks in @entity5 are attempting to have their convictions quashed on human rights grounds			1
extremists @entity8 and @entity10 , both @entity5 citizens , claim their trials were unfair because @entity5 spies knew some of the information used against them was obtained during their torture by @entity18 security services			1
their argument has previously been rejected by the @entity5 courts			2
@entity8 , left , and @entity10 , right , both convicted terrorists , have launched an attempt to have their convictions quashed on human rights grounds the @entity24 , @entity25 , where officials have allowed the terrorists ' applications to go ahead @entity29 , 25 , was found guilty by a jury at the @entity31 of conspiracy to cause explosions likely to endanger life now the pair have been given a green light to put their case to the @entity24 in a last - ditch bid to be freed			1
if the case is not thrown out it will be the first time @entity5 terrorist convictions have been challenged in @entity25			2
it has provoked outrage because the @entity24 would normally have declared the case inadmissible – as it does 400,000 each year – because the claim hinges on a point of fact , rather than one of law or procedure			0
lawyers have criticised the rising influence of unelected judges over @entity5 sovereignty			0
lord @entity55 , the government 's former independent reviewer of terrorism legislation , said : ' to have the @entity24 intervening in judgments of fact – as opposed to judgments of law – really would be a new departure and , in my view , a completely unacceptable departure			0
' if the government fails to satisfy judges that @entity68 was not complicit in the torture , a full hearing will be ordered which could force @entity5 courts to quash the convictions			1
the legal bill will also be footed by the @entity5 taxpayer			0
@entity8 , 37 , was jailed for life in 2007 for his role in a plot to detonate a fertiliser bomb at @entity79 in @entity80 , or at @entity81 's @entity83 nightclub			2
@entity68 in @entity81 : @entity5 courts threw out the claim that @entity68 were complicit in the torture of two @entity2 terrorists documents claim his right to a fair trial was breached because information against him was ' obtained through the use of torture and inhuman and degrading treatment '			1
@entity10 , 37 , who was born in @entity96 , is the highest member of @entity2 to go on trial in @entity5			1
convicted of ' directing terrorism ' , he had links with the 7/7 and 21/7 bomb plotters			0
former shadow home secretary @entity101 has demanded an inquiry as there is ' hard evidence ' of torture in the men 's cases .			0
