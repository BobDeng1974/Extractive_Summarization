by @entity0 published : 04:07 est , 23 august 2012 updated : 05:11 est , 23 august 2012 numbers of a @entity3 seabird have fallen so low that experts fear the breed could soon become the first victim of climate change			2
one breeding colony of the @entity9 in @entity10 is now extinct and others are predicted to disappear within three years , according to wildlife experts			2
the sea bird , one of the most abundant in the world , is disappearing at an ' alarming ' rate , the @entity17 for the @entity18 ( @entity19 ) said			0
end of the road ? experts say the @entity9 sea bird could face extinction in @entity10 within three years conservationists say the decline is down to alterations to the marine environment brought on by climate change , with the @entity30 's food chain being ' profoundly affected '			1
the population of @entity9 has more than halved in the @entity3 since the mid- 1980s and the breeding numbers in @entity10 have declined by almost two - thirds			2
the far north of @entity10 has seen some of the steepest declines , particularly in @entity37 and @entity38 where about one fifth of the @entity9 population return to breed each year			1
however , in just over a decade , experts have recorded a massive 82 per cent decline in breeding pairs at @entity38 's ' seabird cities '			1
counts undertaken by the @entity19 and the @entity46 ( @entity46 ) also revealed populations on the @entity38 mainland fell from nearly 11,000 pairs in 2000 to under 2,000 this year			1
kittiwakes failed to return to the ' once - bursting ' cliff colony of @entity38 's @entity52 this year - and cliffs at @entity54 held less than 200 breeding pars			1
some of the steepest declines have been in the far north of @entity10 , particularly in @entity38 ( pictured ) three other colonies are ' hanging on by a thread ; with fewer than 90 nests each - indicating potential local extinction within the next three years			2
@entity60 , @entity61 , said : ' the counts this year are deeply shocking , especially the loss of kittiwakes at @entity65			0
we know that kittiwakes in other parts of @entity38 are equally affected , and to think of @entity38 without thriving colonies of these fantastic birds is a sad prospect			0
the @entity72 is a medium - sized gull with a small yellow bill and a dark eye , a grey back but with a white underside it feeds on fish , shrimps and worms			0
in flight , its black - tipped wings look as though they are ' dipped in ink ' in the breeding season , this coastal gull can be found in seabird colonies around the @entity3 in late summer and autumn it can be seen flying past offshore , or collecting at roosts , while it spends the winter months out at sea the best time to see them is on breeding grounds in spring and summer source : @entity19 ' it now appears undeniable that the declines in kittiwake and other seabirds are being driven by changes in the marine environment related to climate change			1
the food chain of the @entity30 is being profoundly affected , and seabirds , at the top of the chain , are suffering			1
' everyone with an interest in our seas and their health should be paying attention to this			0
' seabirds remain largely unprotected at sea and have been marginalised in the identification of new @entity116 - this obvious gap needs to be filled if @entity10 is going to prove it is serious about protecting threatened wildlife			0
' most of the breeding kittiwakes - 1,134 pairs - were found at @entity19 @entity10 's @entity124 nature reserve , but these numbers were 75 per cent lower than in 1999 , when 5,400 pairs were nesting			1
the @entity128 nature reserve in @entity37 also reported a poor year , with only a few chicks hatching			0
however , a kittiwake colony at @entity131 on the @entity132 experienced its best season in years with more than 500 chicks fledging			0
meanwhile , a colony in @entity136 which had been described as being in ' freefall ' has seen a halt in the long - term decline of @entity9 numbers			0
experts have been encouraged by the number of chicks in recent years			0
the @entity19 said a fuller picture of this year 's seabird breeding season will be available in the autumn .			1

@entity10 's ' seabird cities ' in @entity38 see a ' *staggering* ' 82 per cent decline in breeding pairs over last decade
@entity38 population fell from 11,000 pairs in 2000 to under 2,000 this year
experts say altered marine environment related to climate is to blame , with the @entity30 's food chain profoundly affected
