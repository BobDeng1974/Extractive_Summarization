it applies to anything from that species , such as skin , fur and teeth under @entity15 and @entity98 law , you must apply to the @entity99 for a permit before importing anything on the list when something is imported , it must also have a permit proving it was sourced legally by the country of export without these documents , your items can be confiscated by customs officials - but you have the right to appeal there is also other international legislation applying to the trade of endangered species			1
some can impose fines of hundreds of thousands of dollars and carry jail terms it was the first time that the @entity6 company had exported to the @entity15 , but she was unaware of that			2
