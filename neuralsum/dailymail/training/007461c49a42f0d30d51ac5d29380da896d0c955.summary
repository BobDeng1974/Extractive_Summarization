this horrifying picture was taken of a deer that wandered into a @entity3 garden			1
this deer with an arrow shot cleanly through its head was spotted and photographed by resident @entity7			1
she says she was shocked to see the deer at her home in @entity10 with a dart wedged through its muzzle			2
' shocked ' : @entity7 said she took this photo of a deer impaled by an arrow in her @entity3 back yard ' want to know what sucks ? this ! ' she posted on her @entity19 page , ' tried to capture him to no avail ... he can eat , run and there 's no blood , less chance of infection			1
i just feel so bad for him			0
' the animal was n't bleeding and did n't appear to be frightened , she claimed			0
ms @entity7 immediately contacted animal control and they turned up the same day but were unable to catch the animal			2
she said the deer was a regular visitor to her back garden			1
deer are attracted to her large property thanks to a big pear tree and its location next to the @entity41			1
' i know a lot of hunters and i know that was nothing done intentionally , ' ms @entity7 told her local paper			2
' i 'm sure if any hunter saw him , they would have been kind of enough to put him down			0
' bow hunting for deer is legal in all 50 states , but ethical hunters aim for the body ms @entity7 spoke to a @entity58 representative and followed their advice to put out a supply of corn for the deer , which appeared to be travelling in a herd with four others			1
bow hunting is legal in all 50 states anywhere there 's rifle season also has a bow season - but it usually starts a few weeks earlier less deer are harvested each year than by rifle hunters , mainly due to difficulty @entity73 bow hunters aim for the body , not the head source : @entity77 , @entity78 the state @entity79 sent out a crew to the area looking for the deer , and spokesman @entity84 said the department would tranquilize the animal in the hopes of removing the arrow			1
ms @entity7 said they told her to call them as soon as the deer reappeared in her back garden and they would try to catch it			1
her efforts to help the animal were applauded by her friends on @entity19 after she posted the image , taken from her back fence , and many of them expressed their sadness at deer 's plight			0
she posted on her @entity19 page : ' i 've been on " deer watch " since just before 5am			0
' i am also sure this was not done intentionally			0
any hunters i know would have looked for this deer knowing they missed a clean shot			0
in addition to that , all the hunters i know , hunt for food			0
' @entity3 's @entity79 sent out a crew and is looking for the wounded animal			2

she says it is a regular visitor and is attracted to her property for pear tree
