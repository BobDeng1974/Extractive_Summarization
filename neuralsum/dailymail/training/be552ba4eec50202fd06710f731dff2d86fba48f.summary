' these gentle , placid giants are globally threatened by overfishing , accidental catches , and ship strikes			0
there 's a good chance that the species wo n't survive if we do n't actively help them , ' he said			0
his work in preserving whale sharks has lead him to some of the most beautiful destinations in the world and while @entity221 's famous @entity65 makes an appearance in his list of top five places to dive in the world , he admits that the @entity114 are unrivalled when it comes to nature			1
the mammoth whale sharks , who swam into the nets , looked like they were being chocked by the fisherman 's net as they desperately tried to get out there were two sharks in the net - one 8m long adult and a smaller 5m fish - during the dive , which took place in november the divers came to the aid of the whale sharks who had become tangled in the gigantic fishing nets eventually , the whale sharks were set free and followed the divers to thank them			1
the whole thing was caught on camera by @entity0 ' the top places i have dived are the @entity114 , southern @entity138 , the outer @entity65 , @entity137 and @entity189 , ' he said			1
' i love big animals - sharks , sea turtles , whales - and these places all have plenty of wildlife			0
' ' i visited the @entity114 for the first time this year			0
i had wanted to go there my whole life , but the reality still exceeded my imagination			0
' i saw gigantic , pregnant whale sharks swimming through schools of hundreds of hammerhead sharks , dived with the marine iguanas and giant ocean sunfish , watched orca hunting and that 's aside from all the fascinating life on land			1
it 's a once in a lifetime trip , but i definitely plan to go back			0
