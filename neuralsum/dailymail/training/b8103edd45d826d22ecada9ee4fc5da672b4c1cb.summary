by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity2 has played his first round of golf since announcing that he will play for @entity5 rather than @entity6 at the @entity7 in @entity8			1
the 25 - year - old will take part in the @entity11 as golf makes its return to the @entity14 for the first time since 1904 , but things have n't been going his way during the first round of the @entity19			1
pre-tournament favourite @entity2 blamed a ' sloppy ' short game for an opening round of 74 which left him facing a battle to avoid another early exit from the @entity19			1
not the best : @entity2 blamed a ' sloppy ' short game for an opening round of 74 @entity2 has a relatively poor record in his national championship , recording two top - 10 finishes in seven appearances and missing the cut last year along with @entity31 , @entity32 and @entity33			1
the 25 - year - old had the added incentives of being able to move top of the @entity37 to @entity38 and getting back inside the top five on the world rankings with a good performance , but could only finish three over par in perfect conditions at @entity44			1
' i still drove the ball great and got in the positions that you need to , but short - sided myself a couple of times , hit a couple of loose shots with my wedges and could not get a putt to drop , ' said @entity2 , who had carded an approximate 62 in wednesday 's pro-am			2
' i was pretty sloppy with the scoring clubs so i might head to the range this afternoon to work on those			0
i need to do better tomorrow to be here for the weekend			0
' struggle : @entity2 reacts after a bunker shot on the 11th during @entity61 of the 2014 @entity19 starting from the 10th , @entity2 hit his third shot to the 537 - yard par - five over the green and had to scramble for his par , something he was unable to do on the short 11th after finding sand off the tee			1
@entity2 split the fairway on the next but had to save par again after coming up short of the green with his approach , while another missed green on the 14th resulted in a second bogey of the day after a duffed chip			0
a birdie on the par - five 18th took @entity2 to the turn in one over , but another bogey soon followed on the second when a misjudged approach flew well over the green			2
@entity2 was lucky not to pull his tee shot into the water on the third , but failed to make the most of his good fortune before repairing some of the damage with a birdie on the par - five fifth			2
after three - putting the sixth and failing to get up and down from a bunker on the seventh , @entity2 at least finished in style with a birdie on the last which prompted the two - time major winner to raise his arms in mock celebration			1
incentive : @entity2 could move top of the @entity97 to @entity38 with a good performance ' not being able to do much on monday and tuesday was really frustrating , but i played well in the pro-am and had a good practice session on the range till about 8pm last night , ' added @entity2 , whose clubs only arrived on wednesday morning after being mislaid in transit from the @entity105			0
' it 's tough because i feel like i have been playing well for a while and i am still getting days like this			0
when you are playing well you should be capitalising on that and not throwing in scores like i did today ( thursday )			0
' playing partner @entity31 fared considerably better than @entity2 , the three - time major winner also making a birdie on the last to return a two - under - par 69			2
but that was still five shots off the clubhouse target set by @entity118 's @entity117 , who carded eight birdies and one bogey to establish a new course record of 64			0
@entity123 's @entity122 , who was the leading amateur in last week 's @entity124 , carded a one - over 72 in his first tournament round as a professional			0
not going well : the 25 - year - old cut a frustrated figure on the course at @entity44			1

@entity2 plays for first time since announcing he will play for @entity5 at 2016 *olympics*
@entity2 struggles through @entity19 first round with a final score of 74
25 - year - old faces a battle to avoid an early exit
