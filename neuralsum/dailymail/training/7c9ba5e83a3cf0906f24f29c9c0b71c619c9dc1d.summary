by @entity0 published : 17:21 est , 26 november 2013 updated : 06:33 est , 27 november 2013 he has promised to show his baby son , @entity2 , the marvels of @entity4 one day			0
and yesterday prince @entity5 took his first step to safeguard the continent and its wildlife , launching a new project to halt the sickening global trade in illegal animal products			1
accompanied by his father , prince @entity12 , an equally ardent conservationist , the second in line to the throne said he wanted to highlight the worrying increase in the trafficking of ivory and rhino horn as well as bush meat and live endangered species			1
@entity5 shared a joke with his father @entity12 while on a visit to @entity26 zoo to launch the new project aimed at protecting some of the world 's most vulnerable animals the new scheme aims to stop the trade in endangered animal products including rhino horns and ivory the princes chose to launch their initiative in the uniquely appropriate surroundings of the new @entity38 at the world famous @entity39			1
the zoo has two @entity43 tigers , a five - year - old male called @entity45 and his mate , @entity47 , five , big cats who face an uncertain future in the wild			2
to combat their instinctive shyness , the keepers had left nothing to chance , leaving an offering of fresh horse meat and spraying their enclosures with perfume which , apparently , stimulates their scent marking instincts			0
@entity5 is president of the new @entity62 which aims to curb the recent boom in the trade of endangered species and animal products the scent of the day was @entity68 although the female , unsurprisingly , prefers @entity70 , while the male rather likes @entity72			1
@entity73 said : ‘ we have kept back a little of their breakfast - horse meat today - in order to encourage them out of their enclosures			1
‘ this is quite normal and helps to stimulate their natural hunting behaviour			0
we will often hide it and make a game of finding it			0
‘ i have also been leaving a trail of perfume - @entity68 today			2
@entity89 do n’t hide away in the jungle , they like to advertise their presence			0
‘ putting perfume down helps to stimulate their scent marking behaviour			0
@entity47 prefers @entity70 and @entity45 is partial to a bit of @entity72			0
’ describing them as ‘ beautiful and majestic ’ creatures , @entity5 could n’t hide his passion for conservation as he launched his new @entity101 project			1
@entity62 is an umbrella organisation , bringing together seven of the world ’s biggest campaigners , including @entity104 and the @entity105 ( @entity105 ) , in order to tackle global crises in conservation			1
@entity5 is president of the organisation			1
the first issue for them is the trade in illegal wildlife products , which has exploded again in recent years			2
according to research highlighted at the @entity39 briefing , just 60 @entity4 rhinos had been poached by the middle of the last decade - compared to 800 already so far this year			1
that number is expected to rise to 1,000 by the end of 2013			0
similarly out of the 423,000 - strong african elephant population , 25,000 were slaughtered for their tusks last year			2
the royals looked at new technologies are being used to wage war on illegal wildlife poachers , from remote controlled drones to monitor animals to cameras that can be hidden in fake stones to capture images of the poachers and send them back remotely to local rangers			2
the @entity135 spoke with @entity105 president sir @entity136 ( 2nd right ) , and director general @entity138 ( right ) the trade in rhino horn has boomed in recent years			2
while just 60 were poached in the middle of the last decade , 800 have been killed so far this year , along with 25,000 elephants slaughtered for their ivory @entity5 spoke from the heart about his determination to get such experts in ‘ one room to focus their energy and their commitment to one cause - particularly obviously this illegal wildlife trade at the moment is such a big issue ’			1
the charities uses technology such as remote drones and cameras hidden inside rocks to catch poachers			2
here prince @entity5 gets to grips with a toy segull ‘ the idea was that @entity62 can progress and we can really start the ball rolling and the momentum and really try and change and tackle this issue , ’ he said			1
the prince , who said he hopes to travel to @entity169 next year to further his work , went on : ‘ education is the most important thing as we saw with the shark fin soup campaign - the more education , the more obviously we can put out there and show people and educate them on what they ’re buying and what they ’re seeing and really try and change their attitudes			0
‘ i think we ’ve got a real chance of changing the way things are going			0
‘ one of the aims is to identify just who is doing it			0
if they can not be caught at the time , at least we have a picture of the guy so they can be prosecuted			0
’ @entity12 also said the need to reduce the markets for illegal animal products was a crucial issue			0
he explained : ‘ one of the most important things is helping the @entity196 who struggle away , particularly organisations like @entity198 ( the wildlife trade monitoring network ) and @entity200 ( anti-illegal wildlife trade body ) and the @entity104 , of which i ’m president in the @entity204			1
‘ they ’re doing a fantastic job but they ’re up against a huge series of obstacles			0
’ he added : ‘ the most important thing to remember , i think , is that you have to reduce consumption of illegal wildlife parts , whether it ’s ivory , or rhino horn , tiger parts , or whatever from various endangered species			1
