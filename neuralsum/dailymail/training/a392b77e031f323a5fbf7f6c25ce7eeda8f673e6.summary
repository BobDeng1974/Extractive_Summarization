by @entity1 reporter published : 04:32 est , 25 june 2012 updated : 09:50 est , 25 june 2012 knock - off movies are enjoying a resurgence thanks to the rise of online film distribution sites which make it easier to ' confuse ' customers into buying the wrong flick			1
production companies say distribution systems such as @entity12 and @entity13 provide a ' great opportunity ' to sell their imitations , which are made at a fraction of the price			1
but consumers have taken issue with the tactics because it is harder to distinguish between the two when glancing online as opposed to browsing in the rental store			1
confusing : the @entity24 blockbuster @entity25 ( left ) cost $ 130million , whereas its ' mockbuster ' @entity25 : a @entity27 had a budget of just $ 1million			1
the imitation was released around the same time on dvd slick : the @entity24 version of @entity25 was made using the very latest an animation over four years mocked up : behind the similar dvd cover design of @entity25 : a @entity27 lies a rather less sophisticated animation the knock - offs - known as ' mockbusters ' - are what the film industry calls a ' drafting opportunity ' which looks to piggyback off a box office smash by using similarly titled versions			1
they invariably come out on dvd at around the same time as their budget - busting equivalent in a bid to cash in on the $ 18.8billion - a - year home entertainment business			1
one example was last year 's @entity25 : a @entity27 , which was made by 12 people in an office building by @entity50 for less than $ 1million			1
by comparison , the @entity24 version @entity25 , starring @entity52 and @entity53 , was made by 300 people for fours years at cost of $ 130million			2
too similar : production company @entity57 changed the name of its @entity59 : @entity61 mockbuster , @entity59 , to attack @entity61 because it was confusing buyers big budget : a scene from 2011 's alien - invasion film battle : @entity61 cashing in : @entity59 looked to exploit its blockbuster by creating a similar look to original its other knock - off @entity69 was given more than 1,300 negative reviews on @entity13			2
one customer said : ' i made the mistake of renting this thinking it was the @entity52 version			2
' other mockbusters include @entity79 @entity78 ( imitating @entity80 ) , @entity81 ( based on @entity83 's @entity82 ) and life 's a jungle : @entity86 's @entity85 ( exploiting @entity87 )			2
@entity57 , a partner at @entity57 , which has built much of its business on mockbusters , admitted to the @entity91 that they are having to change the designs of their products to avoid such confusion			0
as a result , 2011 's @entity59 became attack @entity61			0
' preying on confusion ' : @entity98 's @entity82 ( left ) has an imitation in the form of the cut - price @entity81 ( right )			0
the rise of sites like @entity12 appear to be making it easier for consumers to pick the wrong film feeding off the box office hit : @entity79 : @entity107 and its knock - off @entity79 @entity110 piggybacking : the big budget @entity24 production @entity113 3 ( left ) and its mockbuster ( right ) drafting opportunities have been given quite a free reign legally since 1993 when @entity98 lost a lawsuit against @entity117 , now owned by @entity118 , over their versions of @entity120			1
a @entity122 district court judge ruled that the @entity124 boxes were not similar enough to violate the law			0
more recently , @entity126 sued @entity57 over claims the latter 's @entity129 knock - off was too similar to the former 's @entity131			0
the companies settled out of court , with @entity57 agreeing to change its name to @entity122 warships			0
' as people have migrated to these new platforms , it has been a great opportunity for us , " said @entity137 , vice president of content and acquisitions for @entity140			0
' we 're not trying to confuse people			0
we 're trying to take advantage of a level of interest in a concept that exists thanks to the major studio release ' , he told the @entity91 .			0
