by @entity0 published : 09:26 est , 29 april 2013 updated : 09:35 est , 29 april 2013 @entity1 has begun testing models of a ' son of @entity5 ' aircraft - a passenger plane that would travel faster than the speed of sound			1
the supersonic aircraft , which has been designed by the @entity9 , is hoping to fill the gap left by @entity5 when it was retired in november 2003			1
at the moment , commercial supersonic planes are not allowed to fly over land because of the noise created by sonic booms			1
a 1.79 percent scale model of a concept supersonic aircraft built by the @entity9			2
this shot of the ' son of @entity5 ' model is taken through the window of @entity1 's supersonic wind tunnel at the @entity22 in @entity23			1
this artist 's impression of a supersonic aircraft shows what the final model may look like			2
1976 - the year the first commercial @entity5 flight took place			1
the first test flights of @entity5 happened years earlier , in 1969			1
250mph - the speed at which @entity5 took off			1
2.5 million - the number of passengers that flew @entity5			1
204ft - the length of @entity5			1
this length expanded between six and ten inches during flights because of heat on the airframe			0
4 - the number of @entity5 engines			1
28 , 238 - the number of @entity45 covered when it flew around the world in november 1986			0
it took 29 hours and 59 minutes to complete this trip			0
the tests being carried out at @entity1 's @entity22 in @entity23 are trying to establish whether the volume of these sonic booms can be reduced			2
a photo of @entity1 's latest test , taken through a window in the sidewall of @entity1 's supersonic wind tunnel in @entity57 , shows a 1.79 percent scale model of the aircraft			0
@entity9 has been tight - lipped on the details of the aircraft			1
researchers tested the performance of air inlets situated on the top of the model to see whether changing the amount of airflow at supersonic speeds affected the aircraft 's performance , emissions and noise levels			1
the researchers controlled the flow of air through the inlets using a remote - controlled device			1
the device sits in the inlet on the right - hand side of the plane - the pilot 's side			2
these tests are part of ongoing research as part of @entity1 's @entity88			0
the directorate is looking at ways of making future supersonic flight over land possible , as well as developing green aviation , which looks to reduce fuel consumption and emissions			2
similar tests are being carried out at @entity1 's @entity97 in @entity98			0
the models being tested use technologies including the @entity102 - like propulsion system , a tail blister , and varying shapes , combined to achieve a lower target perceived decibel level			0
if tests are successful , it could lead to the development of the first commercial supersonic passenger plane since @entity5			1
@entity5 's maiden commercial flight was on 21 january 1976			2
it flew regularly from @entity111 and @entity112 ' @entity114 airport to @entity115 and @entity116			0
@entity5 's first commercial flight was in 1976			2
it flew regularly from @entity111 to @entity115 , before it was retired in 2003			0
flights from @entity111 to @entity115 took just three and a half hours , compared to the eight hours it takes to fly there on subsonic planes			0
in 1986 , @entity5 flew around the world covering 28,238 miles in just 29 hours and 59 minutes			0
on 25 july 2000 , @entity5 crashed into a hotel in @entity125 , @entity126 , killing all passengers and crew , as well as four bystanders			0
it was the only fatal accident , and the aircraft was retired three years later			0
it 's last commercial journey was made on 24 october 2003 from @entity115 to @entity111 .			0

tests could lead to first commercial supersonic flights since @entity5
air - flow is tested at simulated supersonic speeds and controlled remotely through an inlet above the pilot
