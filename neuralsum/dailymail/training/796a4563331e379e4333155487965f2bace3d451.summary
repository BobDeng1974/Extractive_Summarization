by @entity0 primed and ready for action , this collection of striking images from the battlefield could be mistaken for authentic photographs taking during @entity6 but they are in fact the work of photographer @entity10 , who has spent four years amassing the impressive collection from re-enactment shows across the country			1
mr @entity10 , 29 , has always been interested in the history of @entity6 , so much so that he wanted to embark on a project to capture what life was like for the soldiers who went through the conflict through a series of pictures			1
action : photographer @entity10 has amassed a collection of striking images from @entity6 re-enactments danger : the crew of a tank fail to appear fazed as they make their way through a ball of flames war : the images were taken at a number of re-enactments from across the country mr @entity10 began shooting re-enactments with authentic equipment , using a copy of a @entity40 camera and some @entity42 film			1
but when the film ran out he started using a @entity45 digital camera and learned ways to alter the images to achieve his desired effect			2
mr @entity10 said he ' split - tones ' the images and manually pushes the red and orange colour channels in the highlights to give that distinctive warm skin hue			1
he said : ' in the shadow areas i push the cooler blue and aqua channels			2
this echoes the distinctive colours of the @entity42 film but also allows the subjects of my photos to " pop " a little bit as there is more contrast between them and the background colours			2
' he said he also reduces the saturation of the blue and green channels to make the sky and green foliage duller			2
he photographed scenes from events including @entity74 , in @entity75 , and @entity76 , in @entity77			1
he now has a gallery of images that are reminiscent of the atrocious scenes soldiers went through during the war			1
mr @entity10 , from @entity75 , said : ' when i was given the chance to step onto the battlefield that first time i realised that i could use my camera to capture and recreate some of the drama and emotion that the histories speak of			1
' many of my images show the time spent working on various tasks around camp or the long marches that the soldiers would have had to have undertaken whilst on patrol			1
' i am always on the lookout for an emotional connection in the shot			0
whether that is fear , weariness or happiness , i am looking to convey that emotion through the images to give a feel of what it might have been like back then			0
' i know this does n't come close to the true terror of being in conflict but i try to convey as much as i can in this fabricated scenario			0
' some of the pictures show front - line conditions with trenches and hastily constructed fortifications , a rearward command station with officers , medical stations and surgeons			1
mr @entity10 came up with the idea after his brother joined a re-enactment group and he was asked to take some pictures for them			1
he said : ' they threw some overalls at me and invited me onto the camp and to take photos from the back of one of the vehicles during a battle			0
' from that point i knew that this was something i could make a body of work from and it has been my passion since			2
' thousands is spent on high quality replica equipment and powerful pyrotechnics to make the re-enactments as realistic as possible			1
mr @entity10 added : ' these re-enactors have a burning passion for history and use the living history areas to try and teach the public about what it would have been like to be an @entity152 or @entity153 soldier during the war			1
' i have often been asked about whether this is glorifying war , but they are truly passionate about educating people			1
' explosive : thousands is spent on high quality replica equipment and powerful pyrotechnics to make the re-enactments as realistic as possible re-enactment : a soldier lies wounded in the trench as a crowd watch the re-enactment in the background down time : soldiers are captured relaxing in the realistic war - torn environment combat : the pictures capture what some of the atrocities may have been like for soldiers during the @entity6 just an act : mr @entity10 photographed scenes from events including @entity74 , in @entity75 , and @entity76 , in @entity77 demolished : a building stands partly demolished in the background as a tank makes its way through this war - torn scene equipment : vehicles and weaponry is used to make the re-enactments authentic armed : a soldier prepares his weapon as his colleagues get ready for combat during a re-enactment mr @entity10 said when he started taking the pictures he was using a copy of a @entity40 camera , used by famous war photographers , and some @entity42 film			1
but when when the film ran out he switched to digital and now edits the colour of the pictures to create that authentic look			0
he said : ' i began shooting with a copy of the famous @entity40 camera - a popular choice for famous war photographers like @entity211 and @entity212 smith - and some out of date @entity42 film			2
' when the film ran out i changed to digital but tried to emulate the look i achieved with the original set up			0
' i now shoot using my @entity216 and assorted lenses			0
it allows me to be flexible and react quickly to what is happening around me			0
' effects-wise i have based my editing on the colour film images from the late war period , specifically the @entity42 film			0
this film had a very distinct orange tint to human skin tones and a wide contrast with a mild grain			0
violent : a man has suffered a head wound in this violent re-enactment atmospheric : mr @entity10 started his the project using a copy of the famous @entity40 camera and some out of date @entity42 film action shot : mr @entity10 captures the action as soldiers engage in combat during a re-enactment realism : despite the fact they were taken during re-enactments , the pictures look as if they could have come from the @entity6 authentic : the photographer now edits the film digitally to make the pictures look as if they came from the late war period time to rest : many of the images show time spent working around camp or the long marches the soldiers would have had to undertake project : mr @entity10 came up with the idea after his brother joined a re-enactment group and he was asked take some pictures for them in the distance : a soldier peers through a telescopic lens during a re-enactment heavy duty : a tank fires as part of a realistic re-enactment , captured by photographer @entity10 ' i have tried to emulate this but at the same time given a slightly cinematic effect of my own			1
i have had to purposefully soften the images as the modern equipment i use is just too sharp			2
' when the images are in perfect focus they lose some of their emotion and look less dramatic			0
i think i have come away with something that looks authentic to the era but has leanings toward a more dramatic cinematic look			0
' mr @entity10 said he ' split - tones ' the images and manually pushes the red and orange colour channels in the highlights to give that distinctive warm skin hue			1
he said : ' in the shadow areas i push the cooler blue and aqua channels			0
this echoes the distinctive colours of the @entity42 film but also allows the subjects of my photos to " pop " a little bit as there is more contrast between them and the background colours			0
' he said he also reduces the saturation of the blue and green channels to make the sky and green foliage duller			0
passion : mr @entity10 said the re-enactors ' have a burning passion for history and use the living history areas to try and teach the public about what it would have been like ' ammunition : mr @entity10 says the re-enactors do not glorify the war , but are passionate about educating people smoke : a tank makes its way through a re-enactment battlefield consequences of war : two soldiers lie dead in a field during a re-enactment ( left ) while another two soldiers appear to be happy by their supplies of meat and vegetable stew ( right ) marching : soldiers make their way through a field on a march during a re-enactment he said : ' i then took inspiration from classic war films and added my own cinematic styling to the way the images looked to evoke a more gritty feel			1
' he went on to say : ' my @entity347 and 24 - 70 lens are a fantastic ccombination but images are too sharp when taken straight from the camera and they subsequently do not look authentic			2
' i lower the sharpness of the image slightly and add a rough grain to the image to further soften the shot and give it a bit of an analogue feel of film			0
' i always shoot my images in @entity362 so i have the most latitude to make edits without sacrificing image quality			2
' he makes most of his adjustments in @entity368 and has built his own set of preset actions			0
more heavy duty changes , such as removing electricity pylons , are done using @entity373			0
commands : some of the pictures show front - line conditions with trenches and hastily constructed fortifications invitation : mr @entity10 started his project when he was invited onto the camp to take photos from the back of one of the vehicles during a battle re-enactment : one of the re-enactors climbs a pole to tie a rope from a nearby bell - tower ( left ) while a soldier carries out his work near a motorbike , similar to one used during the @entity6 ( right ) in the air : no expense is spared to make sure the re-enactments seem as real as possible @entity398 : two soldiers keep their eye on enemy lines during a combat re-enactment weapons : a soldier armed with a weapon from the @entity6 takes aim dramatic : mr @entity10 said he thinks his collection ' looks authentic to the era but has leanings toward a more dramatic cinematic look ' having a laugh : re-enactors dressed as soldiers talk to a woman playing the role of a nurse reading the paper : a young soldier reads the paper while taking a break from the fighting action realistic : soldiers act out the roles of both @entity152 and @entity153 troops during the re-enactments			1

took photographs at re-enactment events where thousands is spent on high quality replica equipment
he says the re-enactors ' have a burning passion for history ' and ' are truly passionate about educating people '
