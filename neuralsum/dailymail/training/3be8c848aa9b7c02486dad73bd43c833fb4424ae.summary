by @entity1 reporter published : 06:31 est , 21 july 2012 updated : 14:01 est , 23 july 2012 a council - owned civic centre is under fire after charging an astonishing £ 18 for a single bowl of nuts			1
the centre in @entity8 , @entity9 , recently re-opened after a £ 5million refit and a private contractor was brought in to run the catering facilities			1
but several users have complained of sky - high prices , including a delegation from @entity17 who hired a function room for a celebration event			1
they forked out £ 240 for a selection of snacks - but arrived to find just handful of bowls filled with peanuts and crisps , working out at £ 18 per portion			1
caterers at @entity28 charge £ 18 for a bowl of peanuts a letter of complaint from the college read : ' we ordered a selection of snacks with a budget of £ 200 including vat £ 240			1
' what was presented on the day was a bowl on each table with not a selection but filled up with either one type of crisps or peanuts			1
' this worked out at over £ 18 per bowl ! this we believe was totally unacceptable			1
' @entity28 , which is owned by @entity48 , was reopened in december after receiving new kitchens , a cafeteria and bar areas			1
@entity52 fended off strong competition to win the contract to provide food and run the bar , with 40 per cent of the profits going to the council			1
but the company could now lose the contract following a string of complaints			1
in a report to the management committee , @entity65 , facilities manager at the venue , said that he was very concerned that @entity52 was not able to provide a simple service with out his intervention			1
he said : ' it concerns me greatly that @entity52 are not able to provide a simple service effectively and professionally without the need for myself to intervene and provide solutions , or for me to provide my own staff to assist with their poor planning			2
' i strongly feel that we should look to terminate the contract and revert back to the way the service was provided before			2
' he added that @entity52 seems to struggle with orders of more than 100 covers , and high prices and lack of sales meant the council was taking a 40 per cent cut of ' nothing '			2
there have been several complaints of sky - high prices at the @entity28 , including a delegation from @entity17 who hired a function room for a celebration event there are several clauses that would allow either party to terminate the contract , including if the town council believed @entity52 were failing to perform			2
councillor @entity103 , who chairs the centre 's management committee , said : ' we 're under contract and we 're working through it			2
' we 're looking for some improvement which has n't quite happened			0
' there 's some disappointment as to the service and the fact is maybe we can do better independently			0
we 're trying to get the best for the @entity115			0
' @entity116 , a town councillor , said that he was concerned that unless the @entity115 established a good reputation it could become a ' white elephant around the neck of the taxpayer '			0
he added that the number of complaints he had seen in the eight months since he started seemed ' to be excessive '			0
however @entity124 , director of @entity52 , defended his company 's service , stating that complaints were not always justified			0
he said : ' we provide an excellent service			0
we are wedding caterers of the year for the south west			0
' we have a very good relationship with the management at the @entity28			0
' the contract is not under review , it is for three years			0
people have complained about the food at the @entity28 and those complaints have not always been justified			0
' some are , as they are in any food business , and when that happens we aim to make improvements to our menu			0
