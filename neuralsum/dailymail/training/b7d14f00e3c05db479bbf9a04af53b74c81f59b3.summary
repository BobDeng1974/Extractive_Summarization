by @entity0 published : 14:43 est , 5 december 2012 updated : 11:30 est , 7 december 2012 the moon took quite a beating in its early days , more than previously believed , scientists reported wednesday			2
this surprising new view of the moon comes from detailed gravity mapping by twin @entity8 spacecraft , which slipped into orbit around the celestial body earlier this year to peer into the interior			1
researchers have long known that the moon and rocky planets - including the @entity16 - suffered heavy bombardment from asteroids and comets during their formative years billions of years ago			0
as they fly over areas of greater and lesser gravity caused by visible features , such as mountains and craters , and masses hidden beneath the lunar surface , the distance between the two spacecraft will change slightly			1
now they are just starting to realize the extent			0
the moon is ' far more broken up and shattered than we 've seen before , ' said mission chief scientist @entity51 of the @entity52			2
measurements by the @entity8 spacecraft called @entity55 also found that the moon 's crust , or outermost layer , is much thinner than scientists thought - only about 25 miles thick			1
results were presented wednesday at a meeting of the @entity63 meeting in @entity64 and published online in the journal @entity66			0
though past missions have measured lunar gravity - about one - sixth @entity16 's pull - @entity55 are the first spacecraft dedicated to this pursuit			1
to collect data , the washing machine - size spacecraft flew in formation , orbiting about 35 miles above the moon 's surface			1
their positions allowed them to look deep inside			0
underground lunar dykes identified by @entity22 are 50 times longer and 1,000 times wider than the dyke on @entity16 seen here on the left the resulting gravity maps revealed an exceptionally smooth lunar interior - consistent with it being pulverized by impacts			1
fracturing extended deep into the crust and may have penetrated the mantle , scientists said			0
the maps also exposed numerous lunar features in greater detail than before including volcanoes , basins and craters			2
a provocative paper published last year hypothesized that @entity16 once had two moons that collided early on in the solar system 's history to create the orb that graces the sky today			0
but @entity51 said high - resolution mapping by the spacecraft did not find evidence for that			0
the mission is scheduled to end later this month when @entity55 crash into the moon			0
a 300 - mile - long ( 500 kilometer - long ) linear gravity anomaly on the far side of the moon revealed by gravity gradients measured by @entity8 's grail mission a linear gravity anomaly intersecting the @entity117 basin on the nearside of the moon has revealed by the grail mission			1

@entity8 says images show lunar surface is ' far more broken up ' than previously thought
gravity maps were produced by twin @entity8 spacecraft
