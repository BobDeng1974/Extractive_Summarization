patients face either paying for some treatments or going without if the @entity4 fails to close a £ 30billion black hole in its budget , its experts have warned			1
they have refused to rule out charges if the health service can not be run cheaper – or receives extra money from the government			0
it came after a report by the head of the @entity4 @entity14 warned that the health service would have an annual deficit of £ 30billion by 2020/21			1
patients may have to start paying for non-urgent procedures and even to make gp appointments if costs are not cut , experts have warned but estimates show that even if it makes unprecedented cost - savings , it will still need an extra £ 8billion from the government			1
@entity26 , chief executive of @entity27 , the @entity4 financial watchdog , refused to rule out charging patients if this money is not forthcoming			0
and the @entity4 ’s most senior doctor professor @entity31 said that it was crucial that the @entity4 closes the funding gap for services to remain free of charge			0
he said : ‘ the money will be a big issue			0
' but in my mind the real issue is the immeasurable value of living in a society where you , your family , your neighbours can get high quality , modern care without having to worry about money when you ’re already anxious and in pain			0
’ previously , other health experts have warned that in future patients may be forced to pay up to £ 10 for a @entity53 appointment , or £ 75 for a night in a hospital bed			1
professor @entity31 said funding would be an issue if changes were not made they include @entity59 , chief executive of the @entity60 , who earlier this month said bosses would have to ‘ think the unthinkable ’			0
doctors have also suggested patients will have to pay for some non-urgent procedures such as hip and knee replacement and cataract surgery or go without			0
the @entity4 ’s annual budget is currently £ 110billion a year and this amount has been ring - fenced from the public spending cuts which have hit other departments in the past five years			2
but it needs much more money to cater for ever increasing costs of treating the ageing and more obese population			2
mr @entity14 ’ report contained a series of key recommendations to save the @entity4 money in the long - term by preventing patients becoming ill and providing care more cheaply			1
these include recruiting an army of volunteers to carry out tasks such as feeding patients in hospital or looking after them at home in return for getting £ 200 off their council tax bill			1
other measures will see gps and doctors carrying out consultations by email or webcam particularly for frail patients with long - term conditions			2
mr @entity14 also urged employers to offer cash prizes or vouchers to help staff lose weight to tackle obesity			1
but even if these plans are implemented , it is estimated the @entity4 will still need an extra £ 8billion of funding from the government			1
this is to meet the ever - growing costs of caring for the ageing and more obese population succumbing to long - term illnesses such as heart disease and dementia			2
mr @entity14 said the @entity4 was ‘ at a crossroads ’ , adding : ‘ we have no choice but to do this			1
if we do it , a better @entity4 is possible ; if we do n’t the consequences for patients will be severe			0
’ yesterday health secretary @entity123 said the government , if re-elected next year , could provide the needed funding but the @entity4 would also have to make efficiency savings			1
health secretary @entity123 said he could provide the extra funding if the conservatives were elected in may but that the @entity129 needed to make efficiency savings speaking on @entity130 , he added the @entity128 were committed to ‘ protecting and increasing ’ funding in real terms			2
he said : ‘ a strong @entity4 needs a strong economy – then it is possible to increase spending this report calls for			0
‘ we will need to find greater efficiency savings			0
it will be tough to do so , and do n’t underestimate the challenge			0
’ @entity139 has pledged to increase the @entity4 ’s budget by £ 2.5billion a year on top of inflation – but that money will not arrive until 2017			2
health chief 's ten - point prescription for reform the report by chief executive of @entity149 @entity14 said more money in itself would not be enough to prevent service cuts – major structural reforms are essential			1
here the @entity155 ’s @entity154 correspondent @entity153 details the main proposals : @entity14 said changes must be made if the @entity4 is to continue running in the same way as it has for generations			0

@entity4 will have annual deficit if costs are not *lowered* , experts warned
government ' must pay extra £ 8billion or patients could be charged '
aging and *gradually* more obese population is adding costs to hospitals
family doctors should provide more services *traditionally* provided in hospital . gps should carry out more scans and tests , to prevent patients having to make so many trips to hospital , and start to employ consultants and *psychiatrists* .
gp surgeries should be set up in hospitals to deal with less acute cases and reduce numbers of the elderly *needlessly* admitted to wards . with a night in a hospital bed costing *hundreds* of *pounds* , this has the potential to save huge sums .
major structural change for urgent care services , to ensure they work ‘ seven days a week ’ . @entity199 departments should *collaborate* with failing out - of - hours services , *potentially* even being merged .
it should be easier for women to give birth outside hospital – a plan which would deliver *significant* savings . this could involve *midwives* setting up their own *community* - *based* *midwifery* services .
reform of care homes , to ensure they provide more health services and *rehabilitation* help after falls .
more consultations with doctors should take place on email and via webcam . this would save ***people*** the trouble of trailing to hospital and also because it is a more efficient use of money .
*specialist* services – such as heart operations – should be *centralised* to ensure the quality of care is *maintained* . at present , there are too many centres , which is costly for the @entity4 .
***people*** who volunteer in hospitals , or to care for the elderly in their homes , should receive council tax *discounts* of up to £ 200 .
@entity4 cash should go to companies so they can *reward* staff who lose weight with shopping vouchers and prizes . councils should play their part on health , such as curbs on junk food outlets , so ***people*** do not end up in hospital in the first place .
and *underpinning* all this is the hope that the public will start to take more *responsibility* for their own health . mr @entity14 warns only by losing weight , giving up *smoking* and doing more exercise will the numbers ending up in hospital go down .
