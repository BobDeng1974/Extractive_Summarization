so when celebrity chef @entity1 decided to write about her day out in a multi-cultural part of @entity8 , she did n't mince her words			2
the former star of the @entity12 's @entity11 claimed a visit to the city , which has a large @entity16 population , was ' the most frightening experience of her life '			1

but miss @entity1 remained defiant , saying : ' i 'm surprised any of the people who might object could read what i wrote as it is written in @entity40			1

she describes how she accidentally stumbled upon @entity8 's city centre , where one in ten of the population is @entity16 , after coming off a ring road to escape a traffic jam and getting lost			1
she wrote : ' i found myself in an area where all the men were wearing @entity23 clothing and all the women were wearing burkas and walking slightly behind them			1
' none of the men would talk to me when i tried to find out where i was and how to get out of there because i was an @entity40 female and they do n't talk to females they do n't know , while if the women could speak @entity40 they were n't about to show it by having a word with me			1
' i have many good acquaintances and even some friends among the @entity72 , yet here i was , in the heart of a city in the middle of my own country , a complete outcast and pariah			2
' she said the positive side was the ' very good selection of @entity83 restaurants ' and added : ' if multiculturalism works , which i have always been rather dubious of , surely it must be multicultural and not monocultural			1
' i can only hope that in generations to come there will be a merging of the cultures and not the exclusion zone that is the ghetto			2
' @entity92 , assistant secretary general of the @entity93 , said the chef 's description was ' hurtful '			1

' it showed a complete lack of appreciation of the fact we are almost two million @entity16 in this country , doing our bit for our country			0
' when she says that she was in the centre of a city in the centre of her own country , i take objection			2
this is also my country and this is also my city			0
' @entity8 's mayor sir @entity151 added : ' that is the sort of thing that makes me very angry – when someone breezes in from outside and paints a picture of @entity8 that does not have any foundation in reality			1
it may help sell books but it is cheap			1
' and councillor @entity160 , chairman of @entity161 , said : ' i do n't believe that a meeting with one person on one street should mean you can label a whole city			0
' when asked to explain herself following the criticism , the chef , who lives in @entity168 , said : ' when you get to 65 , you will think back on this conversation and i think you might find yourself in my frame of mind			0
' she said that while she had a lot of @entity16 friends , her experience of @entity8 was ' unpleasant '			0
' it scared me and i am not scared easy , ' she said			0
' it was part of my country that i was born in and there are a lot of radical @entity16 preachers in this country			0
' i was in @entity42 when july 7 ( 2005 bomb attacks ) happened and this to me was proof for those people who have been saying we 're getting ghettoisation of @entity16 areas			0
' i have never believed that political correctness was a reason not to say what i have experienced			0

in her book @entity46 , the chef describes her visit to @entity8			1
' i had one of the most frightening adventures of my life there			0
i turned off the ring road because there had been a car crash and i wanted to avoid being stuck in traffic , and soon found myself lost			1
i could n't tell you where i was but it was not terribly far from the city centre			0
' as we know , @entity8 has a very high @entity83 @entity16 population and i found myself in an area where all the men were wearing @entity23 clothing and all the women were wearing burkas and walking slightly behind them			1
' none of the men would talk to me when i tried to find out where i was and how to get out of there because i was an @entity40 female and they do n't talk to females they do n't know , while if the women could speak @entity40 they were n't about to show it by having a word with me			1
' eventually i had to stop at a newsagents and the only way i could discover my location was to buy a map of the city			0
somebody , very reluctantly , pointed to where i was and then i had to work out the rest for myself			0
' i am not a particular admirer of @entity23 or indeed , i should add , almost any other religion , but i have many good acquaintances and even some friends among the @entity72 , yet here i was in the heart of city in the middle of my own country a complete outcast and pariah			1
' if multiculturalism works , which i have always been rather dubious of , surely it must be multicultural and not monocultural			0
i just wanted to relate this to you because i think you ought to be aware of such things			0
' however , everything has an upside and one of the results of this is that @entity8 has a very good selection of @entity83 restaurants where you can eat excellent curry			1
' the city also has a thriving market attended by farmers from the local countryside and quite a number from the @entity83 community too , who sell not only herbs and spices and @entity83 vegetables but also delicious ready - made goods			1
' so thinking back to the @entity272 of my childhood , i can only hope that in generations to come there will be a merging of the cultures and not the exclusion zone that is the ghetto			0
