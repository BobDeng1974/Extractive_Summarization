by @entity0 cultural icons like @entity3 and the royal family help the @entity6 's luxury brands outperform its global rivals in emerging markets , new research has found			0
a survey of @entity11 consumers in @entity12 , @entity13 and those that travel thousands of miles to the @entity6 to shop at places like @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17 found that ‘ @entity26 ’ was an important reason they chose to buy brands like @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity24 and @entity25			1
the study by professor @entity28 of @entity29 found that @entity6 ’s cultural capital represents a number of unique qualities that is difficult for competitors in @entity34 , @entity35 or the @entity36 to imitate			1
the @entity3 and @entity38 effect : new research has found that cultural icons like @entity3 , left , and @entity40 help the @entity6 's luxury brands outperform its global rivals in emerging markets when asked what the @entity11 consumers associate with @entity26 , not surprisingly , the royal family came top of the list , followed by @entity3 , the @entity46 and the @entity47			1
tv programmes and movies like @entity50 , the @entity52 films , @entity53 , @entity54 and @entity55 also had a huge influence on the @entity11 perception of @entity26 , and so does the @entity6 elite education system represented by @entity59 and the public schools			1
professor @entity28 , who will be presenting the preliminary findings of her research at @entity64 : @entity66 , @entity67 and @entity68 conference at @entity69 this week , said : ' luxury goods are defined as those satisfying hedonic rather than functional needs and our research has found this is an area that @entity6 enjoys a distinct advantage in			0
' a very important factor that makes @entity6 standout is that it incorporates tradition and innovation seamlessly			0
fashion pack : @entity24 's annual revenues hit £ 2 billion for the first time in 2013 thanks mainly to sales in @entity11 jumping 20 per cent year on year			1
here , @entity86 leads the fash pack at the @entity89 show @entity6 flair : tv programmes and movies like @entity50 ( cast pictured ) , the @entity52 films , @entity53 , @entity54 and @entity55 also had a huge influence on the @entity11 perception of @entity26 ' put differently , @entity6 ’s advantage lies in the so - called soft power , which is defined as the ability to get what you want through attraction rather than through coercion and cultural heritage is a key part of that			1
the extent of its impact is hard to measure and even harder to replicate			0
as @entity11 promotes its own soft power , it has increasingly turned to @entity6 for inspiration			2
' the love of @entity6 luxury goods in @entity11 and other emerging markets is all too clearly demonstrated by the sales figures			2
@entity116 derives about a third of its profits from scotch whisky brands , driven by demand in @entity11 , @entity121 and @entity122 , making @entity116 the world 's biggest scotch whisky producer			0
@entity125 , the @entity6 ’s leading manufacturer of premium luxury vehicles , saw sales in @entity11 up 39 per cent in january 2014			2
similarly , annual revenues at @entity24 hit £ 2 billion for the first time in 2013 thanks mainly to sales in @entity11 jumping 20 per cent year on year , with the fashion retailer set to open eight more stores in the country this financial year			1
big spenders : the survey of @entity11 consumers in @entity12 , @entity13 and those that travel thousands of miles to the @entity6 to shop at places like @entity15 , pictured , found that ' @entity26 ' was an important reason why @entity138 , a doctoral researcher in @entity29 ’s marketing group , found in a separate study , that the lure of luxury spreads into other consumer segments			1
' there is a trickle - down effect from the tailor - made luxury product segment with high price tags and exclusivity benefits to other consumer segments where more affordable and mainstream luxury goods are offered , ' she said			0
' members of luxury goods consumer - led virtual communities seek to emulate the behaviour of their elite counterparts and to gain the same levels of status and recognition			0
' professor @entity28 added : ' yet this trickle - down effect of conspicuous consumption to middle - class consumers is threatening the very essence of luxury being exclusive			0
' emerging markets like @entity11 and @entity121 offer huge potential for luxury marketers where advertising efforts should focus on " selling the dream " and creating stronger ties with the super-rich			2
for luxury firms unique and customised product offerings combined with exquisite craftsmanship and the @entity6 association will continue to drive sales in emerging markets			0
