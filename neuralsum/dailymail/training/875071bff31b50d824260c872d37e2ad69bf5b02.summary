a @entity1 doctor who appeared on @entity2 late last year has sparked a debate online with the co-hosts , accusing the program of reducing her to ' an instrument of rank media opportunism '			1
dr @entity8 , a @entity9 woman who appeared on the weekend edition of the show in november penned a post on @entity13 claiming the breakfast program misrepresented her while she was discussing @entity15 - a humanitarian effort training doctors treating children at @entity19 's @entity18			1
' in my ignorance , i had unwittingly collaborated in my own exploitation by the @entity24 broadcaster			0
' ( they ) chose to cast me not as an @entity9 physician , volunteering in pursuit of coexistence , but as a vapid tool serving the malignant media construct of a two - dimensional anti-semitic caricature of @entity33 , ' dr @entity29 wrote in her strongly - worded piece			1
the presenters insisted that they had remained sympathetic to her plight throughout the interview and insist @entity38 's breakfast show has a long history of promoting reasoned discussion			2
the journalists feel that the inference that they were pushing an agenda , with a plan to debase dr @entity29 , is ' insulting in the extreme			2
' mr @entity42 and ms @entity40 explained that in the wake of dr @entity29 's accusations , they are feeling saddened , shocked and offended , particularly as dr @entity29 had told them she was pleased with the interview on the day			1
dr @entity29 has penned an opinion piece claiming the breakfast program misrepresented her when they rolled footage of injured @entity82 children and images that depict @entity19 as ' a terrorist state ' in her opinion piece , dr @entity29 explains that she believed it had been a positive experience until she later watched the segment , at which point she felt physically ill , shocked by what she felt was exploitation			1
dr @entity29 alleges that @entity2 chose to broadcast footage of what she calls ' @entity19 as a terrorist state ' which ' detonated her truthful and universal message '			1
she took issue with the overlay that was used during the program , which she describes as showing injured @entity82 children , ' decimated @entity103 during the @entity19 - @entity105 war ' and the @entity106 from the @entity82 side - not the @entity19 side			1
dr @entity29 is outraged , accusing @entity43 of misrepresenting her , writing that they ' prostituted my goodwill in the service of personal or official anti-israeli and @entity115 propaganda			2
' the @entity2 team argue that they gave dr @entity29 's cause , @entity15 , positive exposure and sympathetic treatment			1
' your objection to the segment appears largely to be centred around the overlay footage of the @entity103 conflict which accompanied some of your responses			0
' the hosts of the program insist that they wanted to interview dr @entity29 as they admire her work , they did not come with any agenda and wanted to give exposure to dr @entity29 's work and her perspective the pair proceed to analyse the footage that accompanied their interview			1
' some of the footage we used showed children in @entity82 hospitals without referencing the conflict at all , ' they wrote			2
' admittedly , we did use some footage that was inappropriate to what you were discussing at the exact moment it was played			0
' however , they maintain that the footage was a fitting illustration of the points dr @entity29 had just made while discussing the physical and psychological toll of the war on children			2
mr @entity42 and ms @entity40 admit that the timing of images on screen was sometimes at odds with the discussion , but insist it is an easy and common occurrence in breakfast television , with no malicious intent			1
' as a “ veteran media commentator ” you must know that , from time to time , especially when the hosts veer off script to follow a particular train of thought of the guest , the wrong vision goes up at the wrong time			0
for that , i apologise			0
sometimes these things happen on morning television			0
ms @entity40 and mr @entity42 say they were very sad and surprised when they first heard about dr @entity183 's accusations			1
they find the ' baseless and libelous ' comments ' insulting to the extreme ' both parties ended their letters with angry , impassioned addresses to the other			0
' i felt intensely angry , ' wrote dr @entity29			0
' to be whored out as i strive as an ambassador for a philanthropic mission with universal reach , to be debased as an instrument despite my decades long authority as a physician and @entity9 humanist is nothing but obscene			0
' the @entity2 presenters , after presenting a calm and rational argument , also expressed anger			0
' taken as a whole , we can not see how any reasonable person could argue that we exploited you in any way			0
' to suggest that we came with any agenda , either designed to promote @entity105 or to debase you , is insulting in the extreme			0
' after apologising for their ' minor mistake ' , mr @entity42 and ms @entity40 called for dr @entity29 to apologise for her defamatory and ' baseless ' remarks			1
the stunned @entity43 presenters concluded civilly by congratulating dr @entity29 for her work with @entity15 and wished her well			2
dr @entity29 says she feels ' intensely angry ' as she believes she was misrepresented			0

dr @entity8 appeared on @entity2 in november to talk about ' @entity15 ' - a project to train doctors treating children at an @entity221
the @entity1 woman has penned a strong - worded opinion piece online accusing the @entity38 program of ' exploitation '
she took issue with the choice of footage they chose to run *alongside* the interview , feeling the images conflicted with her message
@entity43 hosts @entity42 and @entity40 *vehemently* deny the accusations and have penned a response online
the hosts insist they had good intentions , did not come with any agenda and find the accusations insulting
they insist the program has no agenda and hold a ' *nuanced* ' view of the @entity19 - @entity250 conflict
