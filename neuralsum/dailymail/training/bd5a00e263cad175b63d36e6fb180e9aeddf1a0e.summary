by @entity0 he has n’t scored as many goals at @entity2 as certain rivals in the race to replace @entity5 ; @entity6 has just the one to his name and , to be honest , the only strike in a 1996 friendly is unlikely to rival any of @entity9 ’s in terms of emotional impact			1
what the former @entity13 midfielder lacks in @entity16 credentials , though , he perhaps makes up for in suitability for this particular job			1
not because he can drop the names of @entity20 and @entity21 into conversations about his formative footballing years			2
but because his outlook sits so easily with the philosophy of a club constrained by financial realities			1
up for the job : @entity6 , who left @entity29 after narrowly missing out on promotion , has put his name forward a coach who felt let down by alleged broken promises from the @entity29 board last season , resigning after failure at the semi-final stages of the @entity38 play - offs , @entity6 does not shy away when the issue of @entity16 ’s established model — buy ‘ em young , flog ‘ em for a massive profit — is raised as a potential issue			1
a short laugh is followed by the @entity46 under - 19s and @entity48 boss telling @entity49 : ‘ for me , it ’s amazing to work with young players , to develop them — and then , at the end of the day , the club has to decide what is best for the club and the players			1
‘ but for me to work with young players , i ’ve done it all my life , not only at @entity58 but in @entity59 — i played with a lot of young players			1
‘ and last season in @entity29 , four of the young players from the youth department made their debuts for me			1
one became the @entity66 , two others are currently playing in @entity68 for the @entity70 national team			1
‘ @entity16 have done very well , bringing players in and giving them a chance , then maybe moving them on			2
they have a good reputation for developing talent			2
well - travelled : @entity6 won the @entity77 title with @entity48 before his time in the @entity79 at @entity29 playing days : @entity6 ( right ) played at @entity13 where he was team - mates with the likes of @entity82 ( left ) ‘ i am not afraid to play with young players , if they are good enough			1
and i know that , in the youth department at @entity16 , there are a lot of good players			2
‘ i know that , already in the club , they have talent			2
i know that the under - 20s just won their title , so they obviously have good players in there			1
@entity16 is a club that works very hard on developing young players			1
’ @entity6 certainly learned at the feet of masters , citing @entity20 as the greatest of all as he recalls a @entity13 playing career that saw him share a pitch with @entity99 , @entity100 , @entity101 and @entity102 , among others			1
it is his work as a coach within the fabled @entity58 youth system at @entity13 that really brought him to wider attention , though , and the @entity16 coaches who saw his under - 19s side beat their hoops counterparts home and away a few years ago were hugely impressed			1
still , working with kids is one thing			2
especially at a big club with the pick of the world ’s young talent			1
what has he done in the senior game ? well , in between dodging @entity123 attacks on the city , he guided @entity48 to their first league title in 10 years			0
if he did n’t quite steer @entity29 to the @entity38 promised land , he was n’t that far away			1
there is a reason that those close to the process describe @entity6 as a ‘ very credible candidate ’ for the @entity2 job			1
if he has no @entity16 roots , that also means he arrives without baggage			1
talking tactics : the former @entity29 boss explains his thinking to @entity138 using coffee cups parameters : the former @entity48 boss has shown he can work within financial constraints explaining his approach to football and his own fledgling managerial career , the 41 - year - old said : ‘ the biggest influence on me was @entity20			1
but i learned a lot from @entity21 , from @entity149 , from @entity150			0
i had fantastic coaches in @entity13 and i learned a lot from them			1
‘ but i am @entity6			1
however much i learned from these great , great football people , i am myself — i have my thoughts and my thinking			0
‘ obviously i agree with the passing football philosophy , keeping the ball , trying to keep the opposition moving , play in the opposition half as much as possible			0
‘ this is the best way to win games — and to make the fans happy			0
because , at the end of the day , we play for the fans			0
they must enjoy to see their team play attractive football			0
especially if we are winning			0
‘ i live my life by feelings			0
when i moved to @entity59 , nobody in @entity13 thought it was the right thing			1
i told everybody it was the right thing — but nobody believed me			0
the same thing happened at @entity29			1
i move where it feels right			0
‘ now i have refused four very good offers because i do n’t have the right feelings			0
they are big clubs but i have refused them			0
‘ i ’ve had some offers in @entity183 , some offers in @entity70 , some from other countries			0
i ’m waiting for the right club , the right offer			2
i ’m sure i will make the right decision			0
i am a lucky man			2
i always have decided where i want to manage and coach			0
i ’m confident it will happen the same for me this time			0
’ asked if he would choose @entity16 over an offer from south of the border , @entity6 said : ‘ first of all , i have to speak with the clubs , to have the right offer , the right feeling			1
relaxed : @entity6 is interested in the @entity16 job but will need to make sure it suits him before accepting any offer ‘ it does n’t matter if it ’s in @entity199 , @entity200 , @entity201 , @entity202 , @entity203 — i do n’t care			1
the only thing i want is to have a good feeling			0
‘ i will choose a place where i can work as i want and where i have the right trust in the club , the right trust of the people			2
‘ could i be happy at @entity16 ? nobody has talked to me yet			0
i have spoken to some clubs , i have refused some offers			0
now i am speaking to two big clubs and we ’ll see what happens			0
‘ the good thing is to have enough offers to choose			0
that ’s the reason i ’m relaxed , because i believe i will choose correctly			0
’ although @entity6 is yet to speak with anyone directly about this position , his advisers have ‘ put him in ’ — to use the football parlance — and are understood to have been pleased with the response			1
he at least should be familiar to some of the @entity16 hierarchy , having formed part of the official @entity13 party for their recent @entity229 encounters			1
and , of course , he has that one challenge match appearance , telling @entity49 : ‘ yes , i remember playing against @entity16 — and i scored the goal			2
if i remember , we won 1 - 0 , so i was the match winner ! ‘ the fans of @entity16 are amazing			2
it ’s a fantastic stadium and one of the biggest and best clubs in the world			0
they have all the facilities , as well as passion for the game			0
’ so maybe he ’s not the @entity243			0
and maybe his words are only the usual flattery , the kind of stuff we ’ve all heard a thousand times before			0
but he ’s young , he ’s hungry , he ’s got a good pedigree and he seems happy to work within fairly strict financial parameters			2
as left - field candidates go , he might not be so far out there as to be beyond serious consideration .			2

@entity6 lacks the playing *connection* to the club , which means no baggage
former @entity29 boss used to developing - and selling - young players
*education* at @entity13 has influenced him , but he remains his own man
