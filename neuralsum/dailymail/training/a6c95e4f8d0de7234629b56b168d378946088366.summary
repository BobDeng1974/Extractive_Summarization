by @entity0 published : 15:45 est , 5 march 2014 updated : 08:26 est , 6 march 2014 a teenage girl who died from an asthma attack after it was revealed that an ambulance was sent to the wrong address , ' could not have been saved ' despite the ambulance service 's failures , according to a coroner 's report			1
the @entity11 ( @entity11 ) has been told that it ' must learn from its mistakes ' , after the ambulance requested from @entity14 , in @entity15 , following @entity16 collapsing with breathing problems , was sent to @entity18 , 10 miles away			1
the ambulance was called at 7.44pm , but because of the mistake , did not arrive until 8.03pm , and @entity16 , 14 , who had suffered from asthma since she was 18 months old , died at the scene as her mother @entity23 looked on			1
the error meant it did not arrive until 8.03pm @entity16 , who had suffered from asthma since she was 18 months old , died at the scene			1
her mother told an inquest she rushed to her daughter 's side after she had called her saying she felt unwell at the inquest at @entity36 , coroner @entity34 said her death may not have been prevented even if the ambulance had arrived sooner			1
however , he said : ' there is a lot that needs to be addressed by the ambulance service			1
' there is good cause for those around her to feel aggrieved			0
' the tragedy could not have been avoided by any more timely arrival but that does n’t in anyway minimise the distress and concern on behalf of the family			0
' i ’m satisfied the ambulance service has been found wanting and has already taken many steps to address the issues raised			2
' @entity16 collapsed with breathing problems at @entity14 near @entity57 , @entity15			1
an ambulance was immediately called at 7.44pm but was sent to @entity18 , 10 miles away , by mistake delays : emergency services were called when @entity16 had an asthma attack but paramedics did not reach her in time and she died emergency care expert dr @entity65 , who complied a report on behalf of the @entity11 , said that @entity16 's prognosis had been ' grim ' and it was unlikely she would have survived even if paramedics had gotten there earlier			1
' there is no doubt earlier intervention would have increased the chances of a better outcome , ' dr @entity65 added			0
' but by that point her chances of survival were low and if the ambulance had arrived a few minutes earlier , it would not have made a significant difference			0
' before her fatal asthma episode , @entity16 had only managed to jog to a playing field and had not taken part in any activity when she suffered the attack			2
@entity16 , 14 , collapsed with breathing problems during an @entity89 sports day at @entity14 near @entity57 , @entity15 , on june 25 she had seen a paediatrician about her worsening asthma earlier that day but was not considered an immediate risk , the inquest heard			1
@entity94 found she died of acute , severe asthma			2
dr @entity94 said : ' this case is quite unusual			0
' her condition was very difficult to treat and potentially irreversible			0
' cases that are rapidly progressive in this way , tend to have a bad outcome			0
' @entity14 was only four minutes by ambulance from @entity102 but , because she suffered a cardiac arrest , paramedics decided it was better to treat her at the scene			2
the inquest earlier heard that ambulances had struggled to find @entity14 during incidents in 2006 and 2012 due to confusion over the postcode			1
these problems were reported to the ambulance service and flagged on its system but this data was lost when the trust updated its systems , the inquest heard			2
solicitor @entity120 , representing the @entity122 family , read a statement on their behalf , saying that they hoped to set up a charity in @entity16 's memory			2
he said : ' the past two days have been an emotional and testing time for the family			0
' whilst some questions will inevitably remain unawanswerd , they have finally been provided with an account of events that led to the tragic loss of their daughter			0
' they hope lessons will be learnt and perhaps other families will be spared the same heartache and devastation that they will always feel as a result of @entity16 ’s death			0
' an @entity11 spokesman said : ' we have met with @entity16 ’s family to explain what happened and apologise for the delay in getting an ambulance to her			1
' unfortunately we used a post code rather than a road name			0
both @entity18 and @entity14 had the same postcode despite being some miles apart			2
' this meant that we did n’t get an ambulance to @entity16 until 15 minutes after the 999 call and despite the efforts of staff including an air ambulance doctor @entity16 died			1
lost : three - month - old @entity160 died when paramedics took 26 minutes to reach her after she had a fit and got lost again on the way to hospital ' a full internal investigation has led to a number of changes being made to the way we work to prevent such tragic incidents from happening again			0
' this includes new processes for verifying addresses and flagging up concerns more quickly			0
' the case of @entity175 adds to the mounting criticism against the @entity11 regarding delays			1
recently , crews were described as ' chaotic ' after another coroner heard that three - month - old @entity180 had died when paramedics took three times longer than national targets dictate to reach her home in @entity185 , @entity186			0
@entity187 , general manager at @entity11 , told the inquest steps had to be taken to improve procedures following the coroner 's judgement on @entity16 's death			1
he said : ' we are moving to improve the level of service that we provide			0

@entity16 , 14 , collapsed on a sports day at @entity14
ambulances were called , but due to confusion , went to @entity18
the mistake meant they set off at 7.44pm , but did not arrive until 8.03pm
@entity16 died on the scene from *complications* caused by asthma attack
a coroner has ruled that she would have likely died anyway
despite this , the @entity11 was told to shape up
coroner says that the ambulance service must ' learn from its mistakes '
the latest incident adds more criticism regarding delays to the service
