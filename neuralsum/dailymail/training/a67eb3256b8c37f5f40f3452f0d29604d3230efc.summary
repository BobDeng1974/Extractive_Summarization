@entity1 has seen a surge in the number of people living in large households because of the so - called ‘ sandwich generation ’ , a report revealed yesterday			1
more than three million of us now live in a household with at least five other individuals			1
the @entity10 said this reflects the increase in adults nicknamed the ‘ sandwich generation ’ because they are not only caring for their children but also their ageing parents			1
ladder : the difficulty of getting on to the housing ladder is one reason for the squeeze on space with young people struggling to get on to the housing ladder , more and more are having to live with their parents because they can not afford a home of their own			1
there were 543,000 households with at least six residents , according to the analysis of @entity30 data from @entity31 and @entity32			1
this has made it the fastest - growing category of housing , with a 25 per cent jump in ten years			2
the rise was seen in every region of @entity31 and @entity32 , apart from the @entity40			0
the @entity10 report said : ‘ all of these areas have been identified as having high proportions of concealed families [ such as inter-generational families ] , high levels of overcrowding and also have high proportions of the population identifying with @entity51 , @entity52 or @entity53 ethnic groups			1
’ more than one in ten households in the @entity57 borough of @entity58 had at least six people living in			1
outside @entity57 , the areas with the highest proportion of ‘ six or more ’ were @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 and @entity66			0
the data also revealed a decrease in the number of traditional one family households with children – shrinking to 41 per cent of the household population from 43 per cent a decade earlier			1
in 2013 , more than 3.3million adults in the @entity1 aged between 20 and 34 were living with a parent or parents – which was 26 per cent of the age group			0
this is an increase of 25 per cent from 1996 , according to the @entity10			2
in 2013 , 49 per cent of 20 to 24 - year - olds lived with their parents , compared with 21 per cent of 25 to 29 - year - olds and 8 per cent of 30 to 34 - year - olds			0
by the age of 20 , 65 per cent of men and 52 per cent of women were living with their parents in 2013			0
this decreases steadily until around the age of 30 , after which the percentages remain more stable			0
by the age of 34 , just 8 per cent of men and 3 per cent of women were living with their parents			0
the @entity10 said : ‘ a couple of factors may help explain this pattern			2
first , average earnings of young people increase during their twenties and level off in their mid-thirties			2
‘ second , the likelihood of living with a partner ( either cohabiting or married ) is higher at older ages			0

more than three million people now live in households of at least six
