by @entity1 reporter published : 09:58 est , 6 december 2013 updated : 09:59 est , 6 december 2013 the annals of fishing folklore full of tales of the big catch that got away			2
but for one hapless fisherman a minor technicality meant his genuine claim to catching a record - breaking rainbow trout slipped from his clutches			1
@entity12 was casting his line across @entity14 , in @entity15 , when he hooked a monster fish christened ' @entity17 '			1
monster catch : @entity12 gently cradles ' @entity19 ' which would have been a @entity15 record - breaker rainbow trout but for a technicality ' it was just a submarine of a fish			1
i was running after him through the water , stumbling over rocks trying to keep him close			0
i started screaming ‘ big fish ! big fish ! ’ to the other guys fishing , hoping they ’d move when we came through , ' he told @entity35			0
it took more than 20 minutes to tire the giant fish enough to land it			0
out of the water , mr @entity12 , of @entity38 , @entity39 , measured his catch as 31 inches long , 23 inches around with a back three inches thick			2
' @entity19 ' : @entity12 , pictured , measured his catch as 31 inches long , 23 inches around with a back three inches thick bait : this tiny lure manages to hook the biggest fish ever caught in @entity15 they estimated the fish 's weight to be 20lbs , 8oz - trouncing the previous @entity15 record rainbow of 18lbs 1oz caught in 2004 at @entity49			1
but because @entity51 ’s @entity19 was not weighed on a certified scale , he can only claim bragging rights about having caught a potential record			0
a phlegmatic mr @entity12 does not mind not being able to officially claim his place in the record books			2
he is more than happy to know he let the prime specimen go back into the wild unharmed and free to be caught again by another lucky angler .			0

fisherman @entity12 hooked biggest trout ever landed in @entity15
but hapless angler was *denied* record catch over a technicality
