it was a simple slip of the tongue , instantly corrected minutes after his last ever ride at @entity4 on saturday			0
after a tearful yet joyous and ultimately unsuccessful afternoon that none of the 18,000 spectators will forget , it was also the point at which @entity9 acknowledged that he was an ex-jockey			1
‘ i am going to miss what i do			0
what i did , ’ he said with a pained smile			0
that whole new routine kicked in yesterday			0
@entity9 makes a lap of honour round the parade ring with @entity17 at @entity4 @entity9 walks into @entity18 to ride his final race on @entity20 as the media assemble to get one last shot a lie - in and cooked breakfast before a party for family and friends at his home near @entity28			1
this week there will be two days as a spectator for @entity9 at the @entity31			1
then , when former colleagues head to @entity33 and @entity34 on saturday to make an early impression on the first @entity37 - free jockeys ’ title race in two decades , @entity9 will be attending the wedding of one of wife @entity42 ’s friends			1
the family duties and the exorbitant cost of a ticket means @entity9 will not be heading to @entity46 to watch @entity47 and @entity48			1
but there is a bucket list of things he wants to do now his life is no longer welded to the pursuit of riding perfection			1
seeing his beloved @entity55 in the @entity57 final as well as , next season , travelling to watch them in @entity59			1
@entity9 with trainer @entity60 after riding his final race on @entity20 at @entity62 on saturday @entity64 presenter and tennis fan @entity63 riding some stages in the amateur @entity68 and attending the @entity69 in @entity70			1
he can aim to reduce his own golf handicap and there is also another sporting challenge to conquer			0
@entity9 , who does n’t play tennis , has challenged @entity64 presenter @entity63 , herself a tidy player , to a match with a tasty side bet riding on the outcome			2
coaches are being lined up for @entity9 ’s crash course			2
come to think of it , watch out @entity84			0
the list of diversions mean in the short term coping with life in @entity89 should not be impossibly harrowing for the man who described saturday as the ‘ hardest day of my life ’			1
during his @entity31 trip @entity9 will also visit @entity94 and @entity95 , both battling degrees of paralysis after bad falls			2
it will inject a dose of sobering reality into his situation			0
@entity9 said : ‘ the fear of retirement is going to get worse in a month or a year			2
i think i will be all right in the first few weeks because i have things to do and i will be busy			0
‘ i will see @entity105 on tuesday and @entity106 on wednesday			0
it will be nice to see the two lads and will put a lot of things into perspective			0
’ @entity112 won the conditional jockey title at @entity4 on saturday as is tipped for a bright future there are media work offers to consider and a likely role with boss @entity118			1
but @entity9 will need something to satisfy his enormous work ethic			2
last week he did not accept rides because he wanted to begin weaning himself off racing			0
but on thursday night , trainer @entity123 texted @entity9 , saying he was short of a work rider for friday morning , start time 7.45am			1
the 20 - time champion jockey was not late			1
he also feels , painfully , that even his amazing records will be broken , perhaps even by the emerging @entity112			2
the 17 - year - old winner of saturday feature @entity128 on @entity129 has lifted the champion conditional jockey crown earlier in his life than @entity9 managed			1
he has the same agent in @entity134 , who said : ‘ what he is doing is freaky			0
we want to keep his feet on the ground but he has some talent			0
’ sound familiar ? a new era may be dawning .			0
