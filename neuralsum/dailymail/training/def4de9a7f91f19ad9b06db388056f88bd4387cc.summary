by @entity0 virginity pledges have long been a contentious subject , and now a new study has shown that they may do more harm than good			0
according to findings recently published in the @entity6 , only people who have genuinely strong religious beliefs actually keep their promise			1
for others - even those who attend church regularly but do n't consider themselves devout - virginity pledges are more often broken , leading to risky behavior and a greater likelihood of having unprotected sex			0
saving themselves : a new study has found only people with truly strong religious beliefs keep their virginity pledges			0
those who are religiously committed but not devout are more likely to engage in risky sexual behavior the study involved 1,380 students between the ages of 18 and 24 , all of whom attended a ' large , public @entity28 state university '			1
when the participants were asked to fill out a questionnaire about their sexual behavior , more than a quarter said they had signed a virginity pledge - which is about the same as the statistic nationwide among young people in that age group			1
the problem arises when those who are n't totally committed break their vow ; if they have n't had comprehensive sex education , they have little incentive not to have unprotected sex			0
' for pledge signers with low religious commitment , there are unintended negative consequences with regard to increased participation in risky sexual behaviors , ' reads the study			2
it also found that these people are even more likely to engage in dangerous sexual behavior than people of the same age who have never taken such a pledge			1
a study published in the @entity61 journal 2008 had similar results ; it found that more than half of young people become sexually active before marriage regardless of whether or not they have taken a pledge			1
however , while 34per cent of people who do not take a pledge say they always used a condom , only 24per cent of those who have taken a pledge said the same			0
' taking a pledge does n't seem to make any difference at all in any sexual behavior , ' said @entity78 , one of the authors of the report			2
' but it does seem to make a difference in condom use and other forms of birth control that is quite striking			0

according to findings recently published in the @entity6 , young people who take a pledge but are not devout are more likely to engage in risky sexual behavior
