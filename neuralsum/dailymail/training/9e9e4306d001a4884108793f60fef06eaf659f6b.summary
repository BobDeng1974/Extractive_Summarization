by @entity0 published : 16:43 est , 19 may 2013 updated : 07:27 est , 20 may 2013 a group of teenage skaters were the unsuspecting witnesses and first on the scene to friday 's commuter train crash that hurt more than 70 people in @entity7			1
the boys were enjoying their evening in @entity9 , trying out new stunts , jumps and skating over ramps when they heard the tremendous sound of the two @entity14 commuter trains slamming into one another			2
the friends happened to be recording as the collision occurred			2
it is clear from the video they were not prepared to deal with the things they saw			2
they were on the scene for a good ten minutes before the emergency services arrived and saw passenger scrambling to get out of the derailed train cars			1
debris including glass from broken windows , twisted rails and other bits of sharp metal lay all about them			1
through the lens of the skaters camera , commuters could be seen helping one another off the train cars that were no longer sitting on the tracks			1
heroism : the video captures acts of bravery as shaken passengers help one another from the stricken train snapped : broken rails and twisted metal can be seen all around the boys can be heard asking shaken passengers if they 're okay , but none of them decide to call 911			1
another of the teenagers suggests climbing aboard the train although it is not clear what his intentions might have been			0
his friend , sensibly , tells him to keep off the train and away from the tracks that might still be electrified			0
viewers may be surprised to note that despite the shock clearly intimated by the boys , no real panic or screaming can be heard from people aboard or climbing off the doomed train			2
drama : passengers evacuate the train that is now several feet off the tracks disruption : the line between @entity92 and @entity93 is expected to be subject to delays for several weeks eerie : the boys arrive on scene moments after the crash occurred but before the emergency services arrive one passenger speaks to the lads telling her that the train ride was ' worse than being on a rollercoaster ' , while another gentleman says the thought he was ' going to die '			1
the skaters decided to leave once the police showed up but there is no doubt the video captures the eerie scene just moments after the train crashed			1
' we were at a skateshop called @entity116 across from where the incident happened , and well what we saw is what you 'll see , ' they commented on their @entity122 film.on the @entity122 description			0
officials investigating the cause of the crash ruled out foul play , and sent a damaged section of railway track for analysis			0
confusion : shocked passengers try and understand what has happened by the side of the tracks overwhelmed : the boys are caught up in the drama of everything they 're seeing and are clearly in shock too evidence : the first footage of the crash could provide some useful clues to @entity146 investigators who are attempting to work out what went wrong it is not clear if the accident was caused by the broken piece of track , or if it was damaged before the crash , said @entity153 , of the @entity146			2
he added that the investigation was in its early stages , and refused to speculate on why the train derailed near @entity9 , at 6.10pm			0
the @entity146 began its investigation on saturday , which is expected to last for seven to 10 days			0
the board will examine the trains ' brakes and condition , signal information and the performance of the crew			0
data recorders from the trains are expected to provide details on the speed of the trains and other information			0
the railway tracks were damaged in the crash , and trains are suspended between @entity92 and @entity174 , @entity7 and with limited service @entity93 and @entity174			1
