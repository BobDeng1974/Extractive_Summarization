by @entity0 last updated at 8:51 am on 3rd february 2012 justice secretary @entity1 will also slash the time period before convictions become ' spent ' hundreds of thousands of criminals will have their convictions wiped under ‘ rehabilitation ’ plans revealed last night			1
rapists , paedophiles and even some killers will overnight be relieved of any obligation to declare their crimes when applying for a job			2
justice secretary @entity1 will also slash the time period before convictions become ‘ spent ’ , to help criminals get back into work			1
yesterday ministers said it was right that criminals had a ‘ fair chance of getting back on the straight and narrow ’			1
the government admitted the changes could expose some employers to ‘ greater risk of harm through their re-offending ’			1
but it insisted the risk was ‘ small ’ because reoffending rates decline sharply within a few years of release			1
previously , anyone given a jail sentence of more than two and a half years would have to declare their offence to prospective employers for the rest of their lives			1
from next year , that will apply only to those given a sentence of more than four years – meaning many more serious offenders will be able to declare themselves ‘ clean ’ after a period of time has elapsed			1
serious offenders with a sentence of between 30 months and four years will no longer have to declare their convictions after seven years			1
this will include some killers with manslaughter convictions , as well as rapists and paedophiles			1
sentences of between six months and 30 months – the kind given to violent thugs and drug dealers – will expire after four years instead of the current ten			2
and those given up to six months in jail , which can include burglars , will be clear after two years instead of seven			0
but the time periods will be calculated from the end of the sentence , instead of the date of conviction as is currently the case			1
rapists , paedophiles and even some killers will overnight be relieved of any obligation to declare their crimes when applying for a job court fines will be expunged after one year rather than five , and the same will apply to community sentences			0
the rules will also be retrospective , meaning criminals who committed serious crimes in the distant past will benefit immediately			1
last night @entity82 , director of the @entity84 think - tank , said : ‘ there are some employers who are willing to give people a second chance and that ’s a good thing			1
but it ’s better if they know they have a doubtful history			0
‘ by spending convictions rapidly you are deceiving people			2
these days no one gets put in prison unless they have done something pretty bad			0
i think this is sending the wrong message			0
’ jailed : @entity100 sexually assaulted a teenager and punched her in the face @entity100 sexually assaulted a teenager and punched her in the face in an ordeal lasting nearly an hour			0
the 38 - year - old was jailed for four years last november , but under the new rules he would have his conviction wiped seven years after the end of his sentence			0
currently he would have to declare the conviction to prospective employers for the rest of his life			2
@entity100 grabbed the 19 - year - old after she left her friends in a bar and pulled her into a recess on @entity121			0
the 45 - minute attack in the early hours of may 6 last year only came to an end when the woman was able to remove his hand from her mouth and begin screaming , alerting three passers - by			0
police said @entity129 showed @entity100 hanging around outside the bar waiting for his victim , then following her when she left			0
officers said he picked the woman , who was celebrating a friend ’s birthday , because she was drunk and vulnerable			0
@entity100 admitted the offence at @entity138 and was ordered to serve four years for the sexual assault , with a four - month sentence for the punch in the face to be served concurrently			0
detective constable @entity143 , from @entity144 , described the assault as ‘ particularly nasty and violent ’			0
‘ it was only by luck three men walked past and the victim was eventually able to get away , ’ he added			0
‘ she was able to scream and @entity100 ’s prolonged attack was interrupted			0
’ police were able to track down the attacker because he was wearing his work name badge at the time of the assault			1
the victim , who was visiting from @entity158 for a couple of nights , was left bruised and shaken after the attack			0
officials insisted that indeterminate sentences for public protection would never be spent , nor would new extended sentences for the most serious sexual and violent crimes			2
once a conviction is spent , employers can not refuse to give an applicant a job or dismiss an employee because of it			1
spent convictions will no longer show up in a basic @entity175 check			1
but offenders will have to declare them when applying to work in schools , prisons or other ‘ sensitive ’ environments			2
justice minister @entity182 said : ‘ first and foremost , criminals must be suitably punished for their crimes			2
but it is no good for anyone if they go to jail and come out and then ca n’t get an honest job and so turn back to crime again			2

@entity1 wants to slash the time period before convictions become ' spent ' to help get criminals back to work
@entity196 admits changes could expose some employers to ' greater risk of harm through re-offending '
