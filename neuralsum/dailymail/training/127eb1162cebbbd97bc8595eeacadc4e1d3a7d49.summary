to avoid the meltdown , users need to determine if their computer is infected with @entity11			1
antivirus software will not have offered protection , and @entity19 computers are also at risk			1
internet shutdown : software called @entity23 attempts to change the website you visit - and those infected may get cut off on monday to check , users can visit www.dns-ok.us			1
if you see a red background , your machine has been infected , and while green signals good news , you could still be at risk			1
you can also go to @entity36 , run by the @entity37 , a collection of experts the @entity12 recruited to help with the problem			2
the site includes links to commercial sites that will run a quick check on the computer , and it also lays out detailed instructions if users want to actually check the computer themselves			0

the cause of the crash is a piece of software , which was designed to redirect you from trusted websites to other sites in a bid to steal personal information and which found its way onto hundreds of thousands of computers last year			1
when the attack was noticed , the @entity12 took the unusual step of setting up a ' safety - net ' , routing infected machines through their server to stop the ' spoof ' attacks			1
these servers will be taken down on 12.01 a.m. on monday , july 9 , and when this happens , people still infected are likely to lose their internet connection without warning			2

if you wish to check if your computer is at risk , visit http://www.dns-ok.us ( linked above ) and hopefully you will see the ' all clear ' sign despite repeated alerts , the number of computers that probably are infected is more than 277,000 worldwide , down from about 360,000 in april			1
of those still infected , the @entity12 believes that about 64,000 are in the @entity2			1
users whose computers are still infected on monday will lose their ability to go online , and they will have to call their service providers for help deleting the malware and reconnecting to the @entity129			2
according to @entity131 , an @entity12 supervisory special agent , many internet providers are ready for the problem and have plans to try to help their customers			2
@entity131 said other internet providers may come up with technical solutions that they will put in place on monday that will either correct the problem or provide information to customers			0
if the internet providers correct the server problem , the @entity129 will work , but the malware will remain on victims ' computers and could pose future problems			0
in addition to individual computer owners , about 50 @entity150 companies are still infected , @entity131 said .			0
