after more than five years away from television , @entity0 returned to our screens yesterday – and stepped straight into controversy			1
the veteran broadcaster sparked fury during her debut as a @entity8 panellist when she suggested a convicted rapist footballer should be allowed to return to his club because the victim was ‘ drunk ’ and the rape was ‘ unpleasant ’ but ‘ not violent ’			1
but after a huge public backlash in which hundreds complained online about the ‘ disgusting ’ and ‘ damaging ’ remarks , she was eventually forced to ‘ apologise unreservedly ’ for the offence she had caused			2
she said : ' he did n't cause any bodily harm to the person ' speaking on her @entity8 debut , the veteran broadcaster was discussing allowing rapist @entity27 to return to play for his former club @entity28 her comments came during a discussion on the @entity32 lunchtime chat show about whether disgraced footballer @entity27 should be allowed to return to @entity28			1
the former @entity33 international , 25 , was jailed for five years in 2012 after raping a 19 - year - old woman at a hotel near @entity36 , @entity37 , but will be released from jail within days			1
so far his former club , which cancelled his contract , has refused to comment on whether he will be offered a new one			0
but on the show , miss @entity0 – who presented @entity32 ’s @entity44 with husband @entity45 from 1988 to 2001 – said : ‘ he ’s served his time			2
the rape – and i am not , please , by any means minimising any kind of rape – but the rape was not violent			2
he did n’t cause any bodily harm to the person			1
@entity27 was found guilty of rape in 2012 and is currently serving a five - year prison sentence			1
more than 100,000 people have signed petition to prevent @entity27 from returning to play ‘ it was unpleasant , in a hotel room , i believe , and she was – she had far too much to drink			1
and you know , that is reprehensible , but he has been convicted and he has served his time			0
now when he comes out , what are we supposed to do ? just actually refuse to let him do his job even though he has already been punished ? ’ but before the programme had even finished , hundreds of viewers had taken to social media to express their outrage			1
women ’s rights campaigner @entity73 – who has set up a petition calling for @entity27 to be banned – told the @entity75 she was ‘ stunned ’ by @entity77 ’s comments , adding : ‘ drunk women do n’t cause rape			1
' @entity27 had sex with a woman without her consent			2
that is a violent act			0
[ @entity77 ] is guilty of such internalised misogyny that i do n’t think she was even aware of how hurtful and damaging her comments were			0
’ hundreds of viewers also expressed their anger on @entity91			0
last night miss @entity0 , 66 , said : ‘ i absolutely was n’t suggesting that rape was anything other than an horrendous crime and , as i said on the programme , i was in no way attempting to minimise the terrible ordeal that any woman suffers as a result			1
‘ the point i was attempting to raise as part of the debate was what should happen to someone after they have committed a crime and served their time ? i apologise unreservedly for any offence that i may have caused as a result of the wording i used			2
’ broadcasting regulator @entity111 said that it had received one complaint about miss @entity0 ’s comments			2
@entity32 said it had received no formal complaints			0
the former @entity116 star was signed up to join the show as a regular panellist in an effort to stop a fall in viewing figures - despite vowing to never return to television as they were : ms @entity0 made her name as one half of @entity126			1
the couple , who wed in 1986 , worked together @entity128 for two decades a petition urging @entity28 not to reinstate @entity27 once he is released from prison has been signed by 141,173 people			1
so far the club , which signed @entity27 for £ 3million in 2009 , has refused to say whether it will take him back			2
women ’s rights campaigner @entity73 set up the petition on the website @entity136 , calling on the club ’s chairman @entity137 and part - owner prince @entity139 to make it clear that @entity27 – who still maintains his innocence – will not be welcome			1
in an open letter to the pair , she said : ‘ i ’m sure he and his supporters are hoping he can quietly slip back into the position of privilege he held before			0
unfortunately , he still has n’t acknowledged he is a rapist as determined by a judge and jury			0
he will be returning , if @entity28 resign him , to a position where he has huge influence over young fans			0
‘ they must not be given the message that rape is a trivial crime			0
young boys and men have to be absolutely sure that … consent to sex is essential or the act is rape			0
’ during the trial in 2012 , @entity27 admitted having sex with the victim in a hotel room straight after his friend and former @entity168 defender @entity166 , but denied rape			1
@entity27 ’ girlfriend @entity172 and professional footballers ’ association chief @entity170 have backed his return			0
@entity28 did not respond to a request for comment yesterday			0
the @entity177 club has refused to comment on a possible return for @entity27 , who was capped 13 times for @entity33 before his conviction			0

@entity27 , 25 , was jailed for five years in 2012 after raping a 19 - year - old woman
speaking on @entity8 , veteran broadcaster @entity0 said : ' the rape was not violent **...** he did n't cause any bodily harm to the person '
the 66 - year - old added : ' it was unpleasant **...** she had far too much to drink '
her comments on the live show sparked immediate outrage on social media
100,000 people have signed petition to prevent @entity27 from returning to play
@entity0 has since ' apologised unreservedly ' for any offence caused
