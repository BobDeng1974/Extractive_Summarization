no self - respecting fashionista would be seen without perfectly pedicured nails , but most would probably think twice about giving their cat colourful claws to match			1
yet one particular devoted follower of fashion decided to do just this - before realising the newly adopted addition to her family was making her break out in a rash			2
which means @entity12 the cat is now back at the shelter looking for a new owner - complete with her very own ' peticure '			1
however , it appears she also felt the poor animal could do with a flash of colour			0
and no one would have been any the wiser , if the woman had n't broken out in a rash and begun sneezing - caused by a hitherto unknown allergy to cats			2
@entity39 , the head of the @entity41 animal home in @entity28 , said : ' this time @entity12 returned with bright pink claws which were certainly not there when she left the home			1
' we found out they are actually something called soft claws that look just like the acrylic nails you would get during a manicure			0
' it transpires the woman - who had agreed to take @entity12 in for a temporary period until a more permanent home could be found - had fitted the cat with special soft claws			1
trend : the cat was then returned to the shelter - who were surprised to see @entity12 's pink nails they are designed to stop cats from scratching furniture , wooden floors or humans , and last for four to six weeks before dropping off naturally			1
but , ms @entity39 explained , they are not seen as a viable alternative to simply keeping a cat 's claws neat and tidy			0
she said : ' these nails actually really restrict cats			0
they need claws to be able to take care of themselves , to climb and to cling on after a jump vet @entity78 also believes they are not a good idea			0
' there are yet more alternatives like getting a scratching post for your cat so they pay more attention to that than your leather sofa , ' he pointed out			0
concerns : the shelter 's director is worried these ' soft claws ' will inhibit the cats ability to exercise but it seems @entity12 is not the first , or last , cat to get their very own petitcure			1
ms @entity39 said : ' just after @entity12 was returned to the home , i saw another cat on the the street with brightly coloured plastic nails			1
' i really hope this is n't some kind of trend			0
' however , @entity107 - the director of @entity109 company @entity108 - says they are not fashion accessories			2
' soft claws are designed only for indoor cats , where it does not inhibit their ability to exercise , ' he said			2
' it is not a fashion accessory : the colours are a bit of a novelty , but the main consumers are people who need to find a solution other than re-homing them			0

@entity12 was given a pink pedicure by her fashion *conscious* owner
