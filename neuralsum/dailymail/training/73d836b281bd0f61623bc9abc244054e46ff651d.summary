his brother @entity37 , 22 , also denies murder ‘ shortly after midnight @entity8 and @entity11 set off to walk home			1
@entity8 was pushing the buggy			1
‘ their journey home took them along @entity69 in @entity27			2
on that saturday night there was an impromptu party going on			2
the party was taking place at number 43 which belonged to @entity29 the sister of the two defendants			2
‘ both @entity36 and @entity37 were at the party			1
everyone in the house had been drinking			2
the noise levels got louder			2
‘ by this time @entity8 and his family had reached the area outside the party			1
there was the sound of shouting and arguing coming from the house			0
some of those present had spilled out onto the street outside			0
‘ it was at this point mr @entity8 made a fatal mistake - he decided to get involved			1

she was drunk and she was screaming at @entity8 that it was her house and she would do as she liked			1

if you had children next door you would n’t really appreciate it			0
’ she said @entity8 went across and spoke to @entity58 , 24 , who he knew , but then @entity37 ’s sister @entity29 emerged from the house in her pyjamas			1
‘ she just started screaming that it was her house and they could do what they want in there and it was nobody else ’s business			0

he said i ’m going over , ’ she said			0
