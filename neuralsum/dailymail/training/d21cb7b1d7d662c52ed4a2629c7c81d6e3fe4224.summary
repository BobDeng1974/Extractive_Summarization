it is a small @entity1 village whose inhabitants have relied on the sea for countless generations			2
but within a decade , it is expected that the ocean which the village of @entity9 has so relied on will completely destroy it - creating @entity12 's first climate change refugees			1
temperatures in the @entity15 region of @entity1 are warming twice as fast as the rest of the @entity12 , causing ice to retreat , sea levels to rise and coastal erosion to increase			1
many of the @entity28 villagers rely on wild animals to survive at risk : a dramatic retreat of @entity15 ice has left the village vulnerable to coastal erosion protection : the inhabitants of the village have always been protected from ferocious storms by a think layer of ice			1
instead , they now rely on these sandbags the 400 indigenous @entity42 inhabitants of @entity9 , who live in single - storey cabins , have always been protected from the ferocious autumn and winter storms by a think layer of ice			1
but , as reported by the @entity47 , during the last two decades there has been a huge retreat of @entity15 ice , leaving the village vulnerable to coastal erosion			1
the @entity12 government has attempted to help , but its solutions have never been long - term			2
a defensive wall was built along the beach in 2008			2
however , it could not prevent an emergency evacuation two years ago following an enormous storm			2
video courtesy of the @entity59 angry : the inhabitants of @entity9 are furious , saying they are having to pick up a mess which was not created by them tough : many of the 400 indigenous @entity42 inhabitants of @entity9 live in single - storey cabins icy : this aerial image of @entity9 taken in 2008 shows the partly ice covered sea to the left reduction : however , this image taken this year shows how much the ice surrounding @entity9 has melted remote : this map shows the isolated location of @entity9 within the @entity1 wilderness now , engineers predict the 7.5 mile - long barrier island will be uninhabitable by 2025 , completely submerged by the surrounding @entity77			1
the @entity12 government estimates that it would cost up to $ 400 , ( Â£ 265m ) to relocate the residents to higher ground			2
but , with there being no sign that the money will come from public funds , the indigenous residents of the village are furious			2
speaking to the @entity47 , @entity9 council leader , @entity87 , said : ' if we 're still here in 10 years time we either wait for the flood and die , or just walk away and go someplace else			1
' the @entity12 government imposed this @entity92 lifestyle on us , gave us their burdens and now they expect us to pick everything up and move it ourselves			1
what kind of government does that ? ' a census taken in 2000 shows there were 377 people on @entity9 in 78 households with a total of 64 families residing in the village			1
it revealed the racial makeup of the village was 3.45 per cent white with 96.55 per cent @entity111			2
perhaps most worryingly for its future , of the 78 households , 61.5 % had children under the age of 18 living with them			0
when president @entity118 promised to take measures to combat climate change it provoked strong opposition			0
but those campaigning to highlight the issues of global warming will show the cynics how , through @entity9 , it is happening in their own country			1
concerns : built on this long , narrow stretch of land , @entity9 is now extremely vulnerable to the sea desperate : residents are now using every means possible to save their homes traditional : this image from @entity9 , taken around 1900 , shows members of the @entity137 town council wrapped up : pupils from the village 's school are pictured around 1900 @entity9 was first known as @entity141 after its discovery in 1847 by the @entity143			1
since then , it has long been a stopping place for travelers heading to @entity15 coastal areas			1
the most recent census shows there were 377 people on @entity9 living in 78 households			1
perhaps most worryingly for its future , of the 78 households , 61.5 per cent had children under the age of 18 living with them			0
it is the only village in the region where people hunt the bowhead whale			0
originally , it was located at the north end of the @entity162 but later relocated			0
in 1960 , an airstrip was built on the island			0
a new school and an electric system were constructed during the 1970s			0
the problems in @entity9 are also experienced in the most northerly tip of @entity12 territory in the town of @entity171			1
the residents of the town have been fraught with problems this year thanks to climate change			0
in march , the sea ice began to melt and break up			1
after eventually refreezing , it was so unstable that the townsfolk were unable to hunt for whales and seals , completely wrecking their hunting season			0
experienced whale hunters say for the first time in decades , they caught not a single bowhead whale			0
residents now face a long , bleak winter			0
climate change is a divisive issue in the @entity12 among politicians			0
@entity192 @entity191 @entity190 released a 90 - second @entity194 campaign ad last monday in which he calls for a carbon tax			0
without it , he warns , ' millions will die			0
' on his campaign website the eight - term congressman , one of two physicists in the @entity199 , blames global warming on ' the assault that corporate interests are waging on our planet			0
' ' we can no longer allow republicans to deny obvious truths , ' @entity190 says in the longer version of his campaign video			2
' our climate is changing , the consequences are lethal , humans are responsible , and @entity12 must act			0

a huge retreat of @entity15 ice has left @entity9 vulnerable to coastal erosion
it is no longer protected from ferocious storms by a think layer of ice
