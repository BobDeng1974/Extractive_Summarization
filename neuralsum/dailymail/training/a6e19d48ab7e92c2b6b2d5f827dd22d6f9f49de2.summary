by @entity0 published : 05:34 est , 10 october 2013 updated : 07:13 est , 10 october 2013 @entity1 have announced that they will no longer hit customers with added fees for use of their text and data services when they are abroad			1
in a bid to woo international users , they will also cap charges for international voice calls			1
starting from the end of this month , customers of @entity1 's flagship @entity14 plan will not be subject to the data roaming charges which can see the cost of phone bills soar during trips overseas			0
the controversial fees can reach hundreds or thousands of dollars for a single trip even when customers travel to neighboring @entity25 or @entity26			1
the communications company , which is the no. 4 @entity29 cellphone carrier , has been trying to distance itself from their rivals by ditching the standard practice of cashing in on international services			1
branching out : the mobile company are looking to distance themselves from their competition with the announcement they have even branded themselves the ' un-carrier ' in a bid to break clear from the established pack			1
the company sounded their intentions to break with tradition in march this year when they dropped conventional two - year service contracts in favor of installment based contracts			2
in july , it introduced a program that lets people upgrade phones up to twice a year , a move that rivals @entity52 , @entity53 and @entity54 were quick to follow			0
@entity1 ceo @entity55 said their change of approach to data charges was a move gain more customers without sacrificing profits			2
he said that because the company does not have currently have many international customers , they are not making huge profits from the sky - high data roaming fees which are common today			1
according to @entity69 , @entity55 said that by offering to cap call fees and cut data and text charges altogether , the company could attract a new type of customer without losing out on what they already make			1
new custom : by ditching their data roaming charges , @entity1 believe they can lure international callers from other , more pricey , networks @entity1 have also planned to grow their revenue with by offering higher - speed roaming plans at $ 15 for a day or $ 25 for a week			1
the free plan will be good enough for basic internet use			0
but the paid option will give customers the option of watching high - definition video and using other streaming services			2
@entity1 's forward thinking changes appear to have already benefited the company since shorter contracts and quick upgrades were introduced this year			0
@entity1 added a net 688,000 good credit and long - term customers in the latest quarter , compared with a loss of 557,000 in the same period a year earlier			1
that boost was in part due to the launch of @entity104 's @entity103 on the service , which they provided for the first time in april			0
the new plan is likely to appeal to customers who travel frequently to any of the covered countries			0
major countries on every continent except @entity113 will be covered and officials say the list includes the vast majority of the places @entity29 visit			0
added extras : users who wish to access data streaming services can pay for better internet access abroad in addition to free data and texting while traveling in those countries , customers will pay a flat rate of 20 cents per minute for voice calls to any of those same countries or the @entity29 @entity1 and other carriers now charge $ 1 or more a minute in many countries			2
for an additional $ 10 a month , customers will also get free calling from the @entity29 to landlines in more than 70 countries			0
calls to other countries in the program or to other mobile phones will be 12 to 20 cents a minute , the company said			1
data roaming will be where customers save most but there will be some limits for frequent travelers			0
any trip abroad needs to be six weeks or less , and customers need to spend at least half their time in the @entity29 in any three - month period meaning that the tariff is not for for students spending a year abroad , for instance			2
@entity1 also announced wednesday that its high - speed @entity153 network now reaches 200 million people in 233 metropolitan areas			0
@entity55 said the company 's network might not be as good as rivals in every rural pocket in the @entity29 , but it 's fast in major cities .			0

fees for calls to neighbouring @entity25 or @entity26 can hundreds of dollars
