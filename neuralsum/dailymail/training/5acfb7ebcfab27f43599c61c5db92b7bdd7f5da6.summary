by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 03:35 est , 26 january 2013 updated : 04:20 est , 26 january 2013 they are probably the most hated reality couple in the history of celebrity big brother but @entity7 and @entity8 have revealed they faked their way to the final by playing the pantomime villains			1
@entity13 stole the show with their villainous behaviour and venomous ways but @entity19 ' stars said they were simply doing their job			1
@entity7 , 29 , said : ' they brought us in to be @entity13 and stir it all up			1
i feel like a cartoon character			2
my talent for some odd reason , is being an a * * hole			2
@entity13 first revealed their fake ' nature at an emotional last supper for the housemates , but @entity7 's speech did n't win over the other celebrities , many of whom were simply shocked at their outburst			1
with @entity7 , who said he gave up college to become a reality star			1
crying into his @entity51 , other housemates thought the pair were simply stirring up emotions for votes			1
missed out : controversial contestants @entity7 and @entity8 miss out on winning celebrity big brother in second place break down : @entity7 gets emotional on the last night in the @entity38 house as he tells his housemates he felt he had to play ' the bad guy ' @entity61 star @entity7 broke down in tears as he claimed he was putting on a front as ' the bad guy ' and admitted he was intentionally causing upset in the house so he could ' pay the bills '			1
he told the rest of the contestants as he continued crying : ' i thought that ( @entity38 ) would be fun , i could go and be the villain i 've always been - it 's my opportunity to make conflict and make drama			2
' in my heart i do care about everyone			2
i told @entity38 you gave me the wrong cast - it 's been very difficult for me to be awful but you know , i just got to be the bad guy - just got to be the baddie and i had to step up and pay my bills			0
so now he 's being nice : the @entity19 star made his speech during his last dinner with the his housemates ' i ca n't come all the way from @entity61 and not be the bad guy cos that 's not what they cast me for			0
' he then added while himself and @entity8 continued crying : ' it 's been hard to be the bad guy of this season , it 's usually a lot easier			0
' while @entity8 added : ' this was just a job for us			2
we never did this for " the experience " ' on top : @entity34 was crowned the 2013 winner and came out to the crowds looking ecstatic to cheers enjoying the reaction : @entity7 happily welcomed the boos from the crowd and remained defiant when chatting to presenter @entity107 crocodile tears ? his speech led some housemates to speculate he was putting on an act as a last ditch attempt to win votes from viewers drama : @entity7 gave it his all as he spoke of his time in the house , insisting he had a place in his heart for them all ... after causing controversy throughout cheers : @entity8 insisted she 's never seen @entity7 cry before after he sat back down again the speech caused the housemates to also start crying , and his wife @entity8 was particularly taken aback as she admitted : ' i 've never seen my husband cry before '			1
giving her own speech , finally being kinder to her fellow contestants compared to the rest of the series , @entity8 said : ' i did n't know i could complete this - the worse experience and the best			0
i do have a place for all of you in my heart			2
i 'm appreciative of my husband			0
i 'm a bigger , stronger better person			0
' but while they seemed to move the housemates inside , with them all putting on their ' sympathy faces ' , as soon as the drama was over it seems they were n't all fooled by his words			0
taking a walk in the garden , @entity145 questioned @entity34 : ' were they for votes do you reckon ? ' to which the singer replied after a pause : ' what the night before the final ? you just have to break down			0
i ca n't believe anything that comes out of their mouths			0
' and even @entity158 admitted when speaking to @entity107 after being voted out in fourth place : ' i had my sympathy face on but i did think " that 's a load of c * * p. " ' so near but so far : @entity164 , @entity158 and @entity145 came third , fourth and fifth respectively throughout the evening ' spiteful ' : @entity158 , among with the rest of the housemates , admitted they were n't sure if the tears were real but @entity7 insisted they were because he 's not ' that good an actor ' during @entity164 's eviction interview , after coming third , he added : ' if they 're here to be baddies they 've done a good job have n't they ? ' but as soon as @entity13 eventually left the house in second place , @entity7 insisted that ' yeah the tears were real '			1
he added to presenter @entity107 : ' we went in to try and be the most entertaining we could be			0
i did n't come here to meet any new friends ... we came here to be champion ... if we did n't get this reaction we did n't do our jobs properly			0
' it was also prominent that there was only one @entity190 star in the final three - @entity34 was joined by one @entity191 , @entity192 who came third , and two @entity7 and @entity8 , who were voted second by the public at home .			1

pair reveal @entity199 ' was just a job ' and insist they are a *lovely* couple at heart
