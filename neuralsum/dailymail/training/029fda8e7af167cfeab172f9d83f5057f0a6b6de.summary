by @entity0 it is no coincidence that advances in keyhole surgery ten years ago led to a steady rise in the number of people deciding to donate a kidney			1
the operation , which can be performed via an incision so tiny that it can be hidden in the belly button , was carried out 1,068 times in 2012 - almost three times the number a decade ago			1
yet one of @entity15 's leading transplant surgeons now argues that a back - to - basics approach to open surgery - using fingers as well as surgical instruments - offers the best outcome for donors and transplant recipients			1
the technique , known as finger - assisted nephrectomy , has been pioneered by professor @entity24 the technique , known as finger - assisted nephrectomy , has been pioneered by professor @entity24			1
it reduces the operating time from between two and three hours to just 45 minutes , and according to new research , the donor is at lower risk of complications			1
the reduction in operating time also means the kidney is fresher for transplant and there is less chance of the organ being damaged during retrieval			2
prof @entity24 's unit at @entity40 in @entity41 is the only one of 30 @entity15 transplant centres to use this method			1
a handful of @entity46 surgeons are also adopting his approach			2
twenty years ago , all kidneys were removed using a large incision up to 8in long			2
then , following the introduction of keyhole surgery , up to five smaller incisions were required , each measuring about 3in			2
during finger - assisted nephrectomy , a 1½in incision is made below the ribcage for removal of the kidney			1
the surgeon then uses his fingers to manoeuvre the kidney into a position where it can be removed , using instruments to separate it from the connective tissue that holds it in place			2
once this is done , the organ is lifted out with the fingers			2
' with keyhole surgery , you are making four or five holes for the instruments plus a 3in incision to remove the organ , ' explains prof @entity24			1
' complications include accidental injury to the bowel or a blood vessel which can damage the kidney itself			2
getting the organ out of the patient itself takes longer once you have separated the kidney			2
and the longer the kidney remains disconnected without cooling , the greater chance of delayed function			2
' finger - assisted nephrectomy means that the organ is ' on ice ' a matter of minutes after it is separated from its blood supply			1
' patients are absolutely delighted because we leave them with such a tiny incision ' prof @entity24 adds : ' @entity96 surgery is a fine technology , but it is not without risk and there are still merits in old - fashioned open surgery			1
' obviously both are an advance on the very large incision - as big as 8in - that we used to use in the pioneering days of kidney transplantation where everything inside was laid out for the surgeon to see			1
' we have had only very minor complications with this approach and the patients are absolutely delighted because we leave them with such a tiny incision and very speedy recovery once they have left hospital			0
and making it safer and more comfortable for the donors will hopefully get more people to step forward			0
' with nearly 6,000 patients on the kidney waiting list , anything that may increase the number of donors is to be welcomed			0
' historian @entity123 , 68 , decided to donate one of his kidneys to a stranger last year			0
the father - of - two from @entity41 was delighted with his small scar and the fact that he was able to resume normal activities within a month of the procedure			1
dr @entity132 , hair transplant surgeon and medical director of the @entity135 , says : ' while the root of a hair is alive and can produce brand new hair , the end of the hair - made of the protein keratin - is n't alive and ca n't repair itself			1
when damaged , the fibre of a single hair can split into two or more and wither away			0
this occurs due to chemical treatments , heat or chlorine , vigorous brushing , or just wear and tear			0
cutting your hair every six to eight weeks is the only solution to preventing this			0
' mr @entity123 , who had his surgery last autumn , says : ' i decided to donate after surgeons at another hospital saved the life of one of my grandchildren - i wanted to give something that might help save another life			1
no one in my family needed a transplant , so i decided to donate to a stranger			0
my recovery was very fast			0
six weeks later , it was if i had n't had surgery at all			0
' @entity170 , a transplant surgeon at @entity171 and @entity172 in @entity41 , says prof @entity24 's technique is widely admired			1
' there 's no doubt that he is a highly skilled surgeon and there is no reason why this technique could n't be used at other centres , ' he adds			0
' my view is that both techniques - keyhole and finger - assisted nephrectomy - are safe			1
i use a variation called hand - assisted nephrectomy where the incision is about 3in and you put your whole hand in to remove the kidney			1
' but the vast majority of retrievals are made by keyhole surgery			0
i think that being able to give the patient a choice is a good idea			0
' @entity195 is a @entity197 television personality with great hair			0
but in 1991 her singing apparently caused a woman to suffer a seizure			0
an epilepsy expert suggested it was the pitch and quality of the sound causing the problem			0
it has long been known that pulses of certain coloured lights could cause epileptic fits , but this was the first known case to have been caused by the sound waves of a television broadcast			0
