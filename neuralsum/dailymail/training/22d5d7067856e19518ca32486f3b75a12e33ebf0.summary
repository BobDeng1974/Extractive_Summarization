despite their fearsome future little @entity10 and @entity11 are now the twin attractions at the @entity14 , @entity15 and were introduced to the public today			1
the cuddly looking panther twins , with their clumsy big paws and ludicrously long whiskers , were born in late april			1
curious : it 's hard to imagine that these little fellows would ever grow up to be one of the jungle 's apex predators you looking at me : one of the pair emerges from its basket while being presented to the media with its sibling at @entity30 time to play : @entity10 and @entity11 tentatively emerge from their basket feeling shy : their permanent canine teeth do not come in until the age of one - and by the age of two panthers in the wild are usually independent of their mothers both pups are developing under the care of their mother @entity42 , 14 , and seven - year - old father @entity44			1
it ’s unusual that a male big cat would take so much interest in his offspring – but @entity44 has shown that he is responsible beyond his years and has turned into a real family man			0
like all good fathers he was even present at the birth on april 26			2
family love : both pups are developing under the care of their mother @entity42 , 14 , and seven - year - old father @entity44 be afraid : one of the twins bares their teeth at the approaching camera fatherly guidance : it 's unusual that a male big cat would take so much interest in his offspring - but @entity44 has shown that he is responsible beyond his years and has turned into a real family man @entity65 cubs are born with their eyes closed , not opening them until about ten days after the birth			2
they do not gain enough mobility to move around until two or three weeks after the birth - and do not start to eat meat until they are nearly three months old			0
their permanent canine teeth do not come in until the age of one - and by the age of two panthers in the wild are usually independent of their mothers			0
performing pair : the @entity65 twins stare at the public as they are presented attracting attention : the cute pair are now one of the main attractions at @entity30 good life ahead : in the wild black panthers usually live for up to twelve years - but born in captivity , @entity10 and @entity11 may grow to be 20 years old in the wild black panthers usually live for up to twelve years - but born in captivity , @entity10 and @entity11 may grow to be 20 years old			1
the term ' black panther ' can be confusing , with scientists agreeing it does not refer to a specific sub-species of big cat			0
most generally , the term refers to any type of big cat with a black coat - though the only scientifically recognised definitions are a black leopard and a black jaguar .			0

two young @entity107 twins are named @entity10 and @entity11
