by @entity0 published : 08:06 est , 4 march 2014 updated : 11:09 est , 4 march 2014 it was bottled up 235 years ago and has been left to gather dust in a cellar ever since			2
but this historic collection of rum has become the most expensive in history , after fetching £ 80,000 at auction			1
the rare 18th century spirit was discovered in the basement of @entity11 in @entity12 while staff performed an inventory			1
the bottles date back to around 1780 and were valued at £ 600 - £ 800 per bottle @entity17 then sold the alcohol at an auction hosted by @entity20 in @entity21			1
@entity22 , brother of the eighth @entity23 , who owns the @entity25 listed country house in @entity26 said : ' i had always known the bottles were down there but i would n’t have given them another look			1
' but when my late father asked us to do an inventory we thought we might take one and test it out , even though the mould was pretty unsavoury			2
' they were obviously pretty old , as they had clearly been hand blown			2
@entity17 sold the pricey tipple at @entity40 and @entity42 sale in @entity21 , fetching a sum of £ 78,255 ' we brought a bottle back to the shop and it took maybe half an hour to get the mould off , and then another half an hour to get the cork out			1
' the bottles date back to around 1780 and were valued at £ 600 - £ 800 per bottle - but they were sold for more than six times the pre-sale estimate , fetching as much as £ 8,225 each			1
@entity52 , international director of @entity53 in @entity54 and @entity55 said : ' we are thrilled with the results for the sale of the 1780 @entity58			2
' the twelve bottles of dark and light rum sold for a total of £ 78,255 , making it both the oldest and most valuable rum ever sold at auction by @entity20			1
' all of the proceeds from the sale went to the @entity67 - a charity that helps young people in performing arts that has strong links with @entity11			1
co-director of the foundation @entity74 said : ' this money will be a stepping stone encouraging us to start this year ’s summer school , meaning young people can get involved straight away			0
' young people are lost in the summer holidays , but for six long weeks they can work with professionals and at the end of it they have themselves a performance			0
' @entity86 , who also owns the house , said : ' the idea had always been to raise money for some kind of @entity93 @entity92 charity or foundation , and we have succeeded spectacularly at that			1
' it is a once in a lifetime discovery for someone in the wine trade and it has been a privilege to be involved			0
' mr @entity22 added that the discovery of the rum made perfect sense , given the links between @entity11 and the @entity92 - some of the rum has now been returned to @entity106			1
trade : the owners of the @entity25 country house said the rum may have been there as a result of the estate 's historic links to the @entity92 discovery : staff at the @entity26 country house found the bottles while performing an inventory			1
each bottle was initially valued at £ 800 , but some sold for six times their pre-sale estimate royal drink : @entity123 ( pictured in the white sun hat in 1969 ) had a ' tot ' of @entity127 rum aboard the @entity128 the first stage of the rum - making process is to cultivated and harvest sugar cane by hand			1
historically , it came from @entity134 , but now plantations can be found all over the world , with many based in the @entity92			1
the cut cane is transported to a mill where it is crushed by a machine			0
after being cooked it is fermented , in an open vat or in labratory conditions , and is then distilled in a heated container			0
some rums are simply bottled fresh from the still			2
however most types of are kept heated for longer and some are infused with herbs and spices			0
most of the spirit is then diluted with water - at some point prior to bottling - which gives it around a 50 per cent alcohol volume			1
it was in the @entity157 that the rum became a popular drink with members of the @entity127			0
explorers who had gone to the @entity92 to make money out of metal , found it was more lucrative to deal in sugar			2
this meant thousands of sugar works were set up around the islands and nearly every plantation employed a copper pot still to make alcohol from the fermented skimmings and molasses			0
in 1655 admiral @entity174 of the @entity93 fleet captured @entity176 from the @entity177			0
while celebrating his victory , he authorised that rum should to replace the official beer ration			0
when he sailed from @entity176 he found that the rum had the natural advantage of remaining sweet in the cask for much longer than water or beer			0
for the next 300 years , sailors were issued a daily ' tot ' of the sugar - cane drink			2
the spirit would also be sold to sailors to bring in extra revenue but more importantly , it attracted a naval presence that deterred pirates lurking in the area			2
but in 1740 , admiral @entity195 claimed , ‘ the vice of drunkenness is but too visibly increasing in our mariners ’ and he reduced the ration by a quart ( just over a litre ) of water to every half pint of rum			0
the drunkenness was cured by drinking of tea and cocoa on ships			0
however , it was still a threat to naval efficiency so in 1850 the rum ration was fixed at an eighth of a pint , until it was abolished in 1970			0
the last @entity127 issue took place on 31 july 1970 known as ‘ @entity218 ’ .			0
