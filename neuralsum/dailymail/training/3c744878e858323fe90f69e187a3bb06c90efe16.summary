by @entity0 it 's long been known than a smelly pair of feet bears more than a slight resemblance to a block of ripe cheese , but scientists have taken this link to the next level by making cheese from a foot			1
experts have made the stomach - churning creations using bacteria from the human foot as well as a belly button and even an armpit			1
scientist @entity19 and scent expert @entity20 gathered microbes for their project ' @entity24 ' which recently debuted at an exhibition about synthetic biology in @entity27			1
@entity20 ( left ) and @entity19 ( right ) have grown the stomach - churning variety of cheese as part of a project called ' @entity24 ' which has gone on show in @entity27 ms @entity20 said on her website : ' @entity35 is a series of ‘ microbial sketches ’ , portraits reflecting an individual ’s microbial landscape in a unique cheese			1
' the cheese is supposed to reflect the flavours of the humans they belong to			2
like the human body , each cheese has a unique set of microbes that metabolically shape a unique odour			2
tangy : the stomach - churning creations were made by experts who harvested bacteria from donors each cheese was crafted from starter cultures sampled from the skin of a different person			1
the bacteria included that harvested from an armpit ( pictured ) , a foot and a bellybutton there are eleven cheeses in the exhibition			1
each cheese was created using starter cultures sampled from the skin of artists , scientists , anthropologists , and cheese makers			1
the samples of bacteria used in the cheese came from armpits , a foot , a bellybutton and tears and were taken using sterile cotton swabs			1
ms @entity19 told @entity82 : ' despite [ their ] chemical and biological similarities , there are obviously very different cultural and emotional responses to stinky cheese and stinky feet			2
ms @entity19 said : ' by making cheese directly from the microbes on the body , we want to highlight these bacterial connections as well as to question and potentially expand the role of both odours and microbes in our lives ' ms @entity19 and ms @entity20 say that their project explores synthetic biology through the practices of traditional cheesemaking ' by making cheese directly from the microbes on the body , we want to highlight these bacterial connections as well as to question and potentially expand the role of both odors and microbes in our lives			1
' a short film was also created that explains the process of the human cheesemaking , along with interviews with the people who donated bacteria samples			1
however , the designers said that the cheese was n't made to be eaten and instead has been created ' to inspire new conversations about our relationship to the body and to our bacteria			2
' there are hundreds of distinct cheese varieties produced around the world today , and all are made with varying recipes , techniques , and trade @entity127 all the varieties , they all undergo the same essential process			2
@entity132 : to produce curds from the protein found in milk milk is pasteurised and a bacteriological starter is added to ‘ sour ’ and thicken the milk			2
a renneting agent is added to the milk to form curds			0
nowadays , most @entity143 cheeseproduced uses a non-animal renneting agent , making the cheese suitable for vegetarians			0
the curd is left to set			0
@entity148 : to concentrate the curd the curds are cut so that the whey is released ( soft cheeses are cut lightly while hardcheeses are cut finely )			0
the curds are either ‘ cooked ’ or are piled on top of each other ( the process known as ‘ cheddaring ’ ) , and further cut to expel whey			0
the curd is milled and salt is added ( in some recipes salt is included by immersingthe moulded cheese in a bath of brine for several days )			0
the curd is pressed into moulds			0
@entity169 : to ripen the cheese the cheese is placed in storage rooms where temperature and humidity are controlledand varied according to the cheese being produced ( @entity176 was originally stored @entity179 ’s @entity178 caves )			0
@entity176 is generally stored for around three months , whilst @entity180 is stored for up to a year			0
cheeses have very individual storage processes that create their distinctive flavours and textures			0
during the first week of @entity187 ’s storage , it is turned daily to ensure an even distribution of moisture throughout the cheese			0

scientist @entity19 and scent expert @entity20 gathered bacteria for their project called ' @entity24 '
a total of 11 cheeses were created for an exhibition in @entity27
each cheese was created from starter cultures sampled from human skin
these samples were taken from armpits , a foot and a bellybutton
