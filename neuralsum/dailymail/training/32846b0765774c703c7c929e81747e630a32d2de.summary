@entity1 's chief spin doctor resigned today after launching an astonishing political attack on the conservatives , @entity4 and @entity5			1
@entity6 dramatically quit barely 24 hours after describing the three parties as a ‘ collection of clowns ’			1
in an extraordinary rant at the @entity12 conference in @entity13 , she accused the conservatives of trying to ‘ buy the election ’ , and blasted @entity5 ’s ‘ utterly perverted notion of patriotism ’			1
commons speaker @entity1 is supposed to be politically neutral , but his spokesman @entity6 ( right ) used a speech to the @entity12 party conference to launch an attack on other rival parties she also attacked @entity4 for trying to ‘ steal the election ’ by supporting a ‘ biased ’ electoral system			1
miss @entity6 , a longtime @entity12 activist , was speaking in a personal capacity			1
but her comments appeared to breach the longstanding convention that the speaker ’s office must remain neutral on party political matters			0
last night @entity32 mp @entity31 said the tirade called into question mr @entity1 ’s judgment in hiring miss @entity6 – and called on him to sack her			1
today it was announced miss @entity6 had resigned			2
in a statement , mr @entity1 's office said : ' after a year in post @entity6 has offered her resignation to the speaker , which has been accepted			1
' the speaker thanks ms @entity6 for her hard work and commitment over the last 12 months			2
' she has contributed considerably to the running of the speaker 's office but now wishes to pursue other interests			2
' miss @entity6 , a former media adviser to @entity49 and @entity50 , has been involved in @entity12 politics for years			1
she previously stood for @entity52 against cabinet office minister @entity53			0
she is employed by the @entity54 on a freelance basis for an undisclosed sum , and is not a civil servant			0
but the highly political nature of her comments is likely to raise concerns at @entity61			0
@entity32 mp @entity31 said mr @entity1 could not employ someone who was so overtly political addressing activists from the main podium , she said : ‘ the next general election campaign will be a really ugly business			1
‘ the @entity32 will aim to buy the election with the millions of pounds donated to them by their hot money , hedge fund friends			2
‘ @entity4 will seek to steal the election , relying on an electoral system so biased in their favour that 35 per cent of the vote could deliver them 55 per cent of the seats			2
‘ @entity5 will try and hijack the election , turning the whole event into an argument about @entity82 and immigration as @entity85 swans around suburbia selling himself as some sort of suburban , saloon bar @entity88			0
‘ and the one thing that will connect this collection of clowns will be a desperate determination to marginalise the @entity12 , for what they all fear above all else is that once again the @entity97 people will put the balance of power into our hands			2
‘ the @entity12 will offer this country a fair deal			0
@entity4 have their warped sense of the term equality , the @entity32 are welcome to their twisted notion of freedom , and @entity5 are welcome to their utterly perverted notion of patriotism			1
fairness is what we will stand for			0
’ speaking last night , mr @entity31 said the remarks meant @entity112 could not remain in post			0
he said : ‘ the speaker has to be politically neutral and has to be seen to be so			0
how then can he employ someone as his official spokesman who has nailed her colours to the mast in a political rant against the conservatives and @entity4 ? ‘ this calls into question yet again the judgment of @entity1			1
if she is still employed by him this evening after this then she should no longer be so			0
it is essential for the integrity of @entity52 that the neutrality of the speaker ’s office is maintained			0
' the row is an unwelcome development for mr @entity1 , who is already embroiled in controversy over his bid to appoint @entity136 @entity135 as the new @entity137 despite widespread concerns she is not qualified for the job .			0

@entity6 used a speech at @entity12 conference to attack rivals
she worked as head of media for the speaker , who must be *impartial*
branded @entity4 , conservatives and @entity5 a ' collection of clowns '
@entity32 mp @entity31 said it raises doubts about @entity1 's judgement
less than 24 hours later she offered resignation , which @entity1 accepted
