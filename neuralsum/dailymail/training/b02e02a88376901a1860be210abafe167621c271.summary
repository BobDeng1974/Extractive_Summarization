by @entity0 published : 04:47 est , 29 may 2012 updated : 05:02 est , 29 may 2012 analysis of grave sites across central @entity3 found that 7,000 years ago , in the early @entity6 era , some farmers had better land ¿ and better tools , which they were buried with the gap between rich and poor began far earlier than most of us might imagine			1
in @entity12 , long before the @entity11 built the pyramids , @entity14 were already divided into ‘ haves ’ and ‘ have nots ’			0
analysis of grave sites across central @entity3 found that 7,000 years ago , in the early @entity6 era , some farmers had better land – and better tools , which they were buried with			1
some farmers grew fat on fertile land , armed with the latest tools , while others starved – even when world population stood at a mere five to seven million , and farming had only just begun to spread across @entity3			2
what ’s more , their children ‘ inherited ’ their wealth , starting a cycle that continues to this day			0
hereditary inequality began over 7,000 years ago in the early @entity6 era , with new evidence showing that farmers buried with tools had access to better land than those buried without			1
by studying more than 300 human skeletons from sites across central @entity3 , professor @entity38 and an international team of colleagues funded by the @entity41 uncovered evidence of differential land access among the first @entity6 farmers – the earliest such evidence yet found			1
radioaactive ‘ strontium analysis ’ of the skeletons , which provides indications of place of origin , indicated that men buried with distinctive @entity6 stone adzes ( tools used for smoothing or carving wood ) had less variable isotope signatures than men buried without adzes			1
this suggests those buried with adzes had access to closer – and probably better – land than those buried without			0
professor @entity38 , professor of @entity64 at the @entity65 , said : ‘ the men buried with adzes appear to have lived on food grown in areas of loess , the fertile and productive soil favoured by early farmers			2
this indicates they had consistent access to preferred farming areas			0
’ a typical neolithic longhouse : but research hints that some had rather better dwellings than others , even 7,000 years ago people buried with axes had access to better farming land than those who had none the strontium isotope analysis also revealed that early @entity6 women were more likely than men to have originated from areas outside those where their bodies were found			1
this is a strong indication of patrilocality , a male - centred kinship system where females move to reside in the location of the males when they marry			0
this new evidence from the skeletons is consistent with other archaeological , genetic , anthropological and even linguistic evidence for patrilocality in @entity3			0
the results have implications for genetic modelling of how human populations expanded in the @entity6 , for which sex - biased mobility patterns and status differences are increasing seen as crucial			0
professor @entity38 said : ‘ our results , along with archaeobotanical studies that indicate the earliest farmers of @entity110 had a system of land tenure , suggest that the origins of differential access to land can be traced back to an early part of the @entity6 era , rather than only to later prehistory when inequality and intergenerational wealth transfers are more clearly evidenced in burials and material culture			1
‘ it seems the @entity6 era introduced heritable property ( land and livestock ) into @entity3 and that wealth inequality got underway when this happened			2
after that , of course , there was no looking back : through the @entity132 , @entity133 and industrial era wealth inequality increased but the ' seeds ' of inequality were sown way back in the @entity6			0

people buried with stone ' adzes ' had better farming land
inherited wealth began just as farming spread across @entity3
*social* inequality began far earlier than many imagined
early @entity6 farmers divided into ' haves ' and ' have nots '
