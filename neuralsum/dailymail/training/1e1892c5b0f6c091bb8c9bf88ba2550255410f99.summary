in two minds : @entity1 has apparently changed his mind about how he felt when @entity3 beat @entity4 during @entity5 he once described @entity7 ’s wonder goal against the @entity8 at @entity9 as one of his favourite footballing memories			1
but @entity1 , who no longer courts the @entity13 vote , has now spoken of his heartbreak at watching @entity16 ’s botched penalty for @entity4 in that famous @entity18 ’ 96 match			1
in a plea to @entity8 to vote against independence in september ’s referendum , the former prime minister said he ‘ yields to no - one ’ in his love of @entity4			1
he spoke fondly of his trips with the @entity26 to @entity9 , @entity27 , @entity28 and @entity29 and recalled @entity31 ’s skills against then - world champions @entity3 in an historic 3 - 2 victory for the @entity8 in 1967			2
mr @entity1 also said he was as ‘ humiliated ’ as any scot with the rugby team ’s massacre at the hands of the @entity37 in last weekend ’s @entity39 match			0
' the only comfort is that we were beaten by @entity42 , and not @entity3 , ' he said			0
his comments , made at an event in @entity45 where @entity46 is holding its annual @entity8 conference , are a far cry from previous attempts to woo @entity13 sports fans when he was chancellor and prime minister			0
in the run - up to the 2006 @entity53 , mr @entity1 said : ' two - thirds of all @entity8 want @entity3 to win , and i ’m certainly one of them			2
' [ i have been to ] lots of @entity3 matches , but the most memorable were the @entity5 game against @entity4 , with @entity7 's great goal , and the 0 - 0 game in @entity60 the following year when @entity3 held on to qualify for @entity29 98			1
' heartbreak with @entity3 up 1 - 0 , @entity4 were given a penalty which @entity16 has saved by @entity62 at the time , @entity64 leader @entity63 said : ' i ca n't believe that any genuine @entity8 football fan could believe that a goal scored against us was his most memorable moment			1
' but mr @entity1 was criticised once again in 2007 when he appeared to back @entity3 to host – and win – the 2018 @entity53			0
he said he would like ‘ the host ’ to win such a contest , before adding : ' of course , @entity4 will do well			0
' in the @entity18 ’ 96 match between the @entity13 , @entity3 were leading 1 - 0 when @entity4 were awarded a penalty to level the match			1
@entity62 saved @entity16 ’s spot - kick , and the ball was fed to @entity7			2
in a moment of individual brilliance , @entity7 then volleyed the ball past @entity80 to hand @entity3 a famous 2 - 0 victory			1
mr @entity1 said : ' i yield to no one in my patriotic pride in being a @entity33			0
i was there when @entity16 missed the penalty			1
goal : @entity7 celebrates scoring a volley which saw @entity3 beat @entity4 2 - 0 during the match ' i was there when @entity4 were playing @entity91 in @entity27 and @entity92 scored that goal			1
i was there in @entity28 to watch @entity4 in the @entity53 , and in @entity29 to watch @entity4 in the @entity53			0
' he said @entity8 have made a great contribution to the @entity97 , and said the ‘ pooling and sharing ’ of resources should continue			0
mr @entity1 also accused the @entity64 of promising tax cuts for ‘ fat @entity101 ’ if @entity4 becomes independent			2
he hit out at mr @entity63 ’s bid to cut corporation tax levels , and threw his support behind a ‘ mansion tax ’ for @entity8 homeowners and a higher top rate of income tax			0
meanwhile , prime minister @entity109 has backed @entity4 ’s bid to host matches for football ’s @entity18 tournament , which will be staged in cities across the continent .			0
