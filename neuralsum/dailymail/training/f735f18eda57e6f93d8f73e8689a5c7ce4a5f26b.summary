by @entity0 published : 10:55 est , 26 july 2013 updated : 11:02 est , 26 july 2013 the hair - straightening @entity2 blowdry could be exposing people to dangerously high levels of a cancer - causing chemicals , according to new research			1
a study has found that the @entity9 acai professional @entity10 made the air in salons contain potentially dangerous levels of formaldehyde			1
it is recommended that hairdressers use products containing no more than 0.1 per cent formaldehyde , but the product investigated contained 12 per cent formaldehyde			1
both @entity23 ( left ) and @entity24 ( right ) have both had a @entity2 blowdry , which makes hair permanently straight without the need for daily straightening or products researchers at the @entity31 , found that formaldehyde concentrations in the air around hairstylists and customers exceeded limits set by the @entity38 @entity37 , the @entity38 @entity39 , and the @entity40 of @entity41			1
‘ our study found that using @entity2 blowout , without proper engineering controls like local exhaust ventilation , could expose hairdressers and their clients to formaldehyde at levels above the short - term occupational exposure limits , ’ study author @entity42 from the @entity31 , @entity31 ’s school of public health			1
‘ while installing local exhaust ventilation is a traditional exposure control , that solution may not be feasible in small salons due to the cost of ventilation systems , permits , installations , ongoing maintenance and efficacy checks , ’ @entity53 said			1
the @entity2 blowdry began in @entity2 in 2005 and usually uses a solution containing formaldehyde to straighten hair			2
the recommendation is that salons use products containing no more than 0.1 per cent formaldehyde , but the products have been found to contain up to 12 per cent			1
the treatment involves washing the hair with a special shampoo that opens up the hair cuticles in preparation for the straightening solution which is applied , combed through , then left on the hair for 30 minutes			0
in the last stage , straighteners are applied to ‘ lock - in ’ the formula and set the blowdry			0
the heating stage is where problems can arise			0
combining heat and formaldehyde prevents hair from curling , creating a long - term straightening effect			2
but when the solution is heated , the formaldehyde emits a vapour which can bring with it a whole host of symptoms there is additional concern that if formaldehyde comes into direct contact with the scalp it can penetrate the hair follicle and permanently damage the cells that produce hair growth			1
the result is that when hairs fall out , they are not replaced with new ones			0
the @entity2 blowdry began , as the name implies , in @entity2 in 2005			0
exactly how the straightening properties of formaldehyde were discovered are unclear , but its use in the textile industry to straighten wool may have sparked the idea			2
better known as a key ingredient in embalming fluid , formaldehyde is also one of the main ingredients in many of these hair straightening treatments			2
first , the hair is washed with a special shampoo that opens up the hair cuticles in preparation for the straightening solution which is applied next and combed through , then left on the hair for around 30 minutes			0
in the last stage , extra-hot straighteners are applied to ‘ lock - in ’ the formula and set the blowdry			0
but the heating stage is where problems can arise			0
combining heat and formaldehyde prevents hair from curling , creating a long - term straightening effect			2
but when the solution is heated , the formaldehyde emits a vapour which can bring with it range of health complaints including watery eyes , runny nose , upper respiratory tract irritation and nosebleeds			1
there is additional concern that if formaldehyde comes into direct contact with the scalp it can penetrate the hair follicle and permanently damage the cells that produce hair growth			2
the result is that when hairs fall out , they are not replaced with new ones			0
the chemical is also strongly linked to cancer			1
according to @entity166 rules , the level of formaldehyde in the hair solution must be less than 0.2 per cent to protect the health of both stylist and client			0
hair straighteners may be the healthier option now that a study has found that the @entity2 @entity173 exposes people - particularly hair stylists - to high levels of formaldehyde but in the @entity38 , where the straightening treatments have been popular for longer , some manufacturers have been caught using solutions containing up to 50 times the limit			1
the explanation for this is the stronger the solution , the longer lasting and more effective the result			0
the product is available in more than 6,000 salons within the @entity38 , according to the news release			1
the findings appear in the august issue of the @entity190 .			0

@entity9 acai professional @entity10 was found to make the air in salons contain dangerous levels of formaldehyde
recommended that salons use products containing no more than 0.1 **%** formaldehyde , but product investigated contained 12 **%** formaldehyde
formaldehyde can cause a variety of symptoms including a runny nose , *difficulty* breathing , nosebleeds and has been linked to cancer
