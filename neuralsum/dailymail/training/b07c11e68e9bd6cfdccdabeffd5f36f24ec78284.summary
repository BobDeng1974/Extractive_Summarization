what a start to the season @entity0 have made			1
@entity3 wins out of a possible four — including two bonus points — is better than @entity5 could possibly have hoped for			0
i was really interested to see how they would respond to making the @entity9 final last year because there was a chance they might have become complacent over the summer and thought they had cracked it			1
what we have seen has been quite the opposite and proves what a strong club the @entity0 have become both on and off the pitch			0
@entity21 ( left ) and @entity22 celebrate as @entity23 beat @entity24 39 - 21 on friday night nearly 6,000 fans turned up at @entity26 last friday night to see them play @entity24 ( not the biggest draw in the league ) which was great to see and proof that the public are buying into what the @entity0 are doing			1
it ’s also been great to hear and see the reaction from opposition coaches , supporters and media to their performances so far this season			1
all of them are saying what a quality side the @entity0 are			0
they have earned respect from people who , not too long ago , had no respect for @entity47 rugby at all			0
this is especially true in @entity49 where they just did n’t take @entity23 seriously			1
that has totally changed now , not just because the @entity0 have won back - to - back in @entity53 already this season , but because of their consistent improvement over the last five years or so			1
@entity55 charges away from the @entity24 defence during the comfortable victory at @entity26 they have earned that respect the only way you can — by winning consistently and not just having the odd stand - out performance that wins you one - off games			0
you also have to consider the number of injuries @entity23 have had to contend with to fully understand how good a start they have made			1
@entity69 , @entity70 and @entity71 have n’t played at all , while the likes of @entity73 , @entity74 and @entity75 were only involved for the first time last friday			0
their impressive form has been the result of two things — good recruitment policy and good management of the players			0
i ’ve been very impressed with how @entity5 has been able to make big changes almost every week with very little drop in performance levels and team spirit			1
there is a real togetherness in the squad which manifests itself on the pitch in the form of good rugby			0
@entity22 adds another three points as @entity5 's side secured a fourth win in four the strength in depth was highlighted when the @entity100 put 30 points on @entity102 last monday and it must make @entity5 ’s selection meetings very tough indeed			1
when his injured players are all back , @entity5 might not know his best team			2
what he will be able to do , though , is pick the best team to play against whoever the opposition is because he has different styles of players in most positions			2
one coach who would love that kind of luxury is @entity116			0
he has real issues to deal with because i do n’t think he is close to knowing what his best team is			2
@entity121 powers through as @entity23 triumphed again despite the absence of some of their stars like @entity23 , @entity126 have had some injuries to deal with , especially to @entity128 , @entity129 and @entity130 , but there lies the gulf between the two @entity47 sides			1
@entity126 have not got anywhere near the strength in depth of @entity23 and that was shown to devastating effect down at the @entity139 when they shipped 60 points			1
it was one of the worst performances i ’ve seen for quite some time and took us back to a time when @entity47 sides were laughing stocks in @entity49			0
there was a redemption of sorts with a draw against the @entity153 , but @entity126 still have major issues and they have a tough trip to @entity156 this coming friday			0
i think @entity116 needs to do the opposite of @entity158 and pick a team that he believes is his best and stick with it			2
there have been so many new players coming in that they have n’t yet had the chance to gel together on the pitch			0
@entity165 has two clubs with very different problems to face			2
one has to find some form and a first team , while the other has become the team everyone wants to beat .			2

*warriors* have won four out of four after last year 's @entity9 final
public are buying into the team , with *attendances* high
despite injury problems @entity23 have been *brilliant* this season
