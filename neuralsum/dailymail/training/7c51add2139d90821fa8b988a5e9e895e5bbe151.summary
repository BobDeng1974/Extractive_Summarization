@entity4 had an abortion when she was eight weeks pregnant
she already had a four - month - old baby and she and partner @entity11 were ' having problems ' so thought it was not the right time for a second child
she continued to have morning sickness and to feel movements
was told by doctors that it was just after effects of the abortion
eventually , a pregnancy test came back positive and she was told she was five months pregnant - the couple have now decided to keep the baby
the baby does not appear to have been harmed by the abortion drugs
