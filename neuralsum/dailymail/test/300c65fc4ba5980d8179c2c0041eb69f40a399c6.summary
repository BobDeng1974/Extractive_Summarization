a @entity2 skin clinic 's popular new laser treatment promises to tighten skin and improve complexion - if clients are brave enough to sign a waiver releasing their personal information to a funeral director and a coroner first			1
@entity11 - based @entity10 says that after just ten minutes , their @entity13 procedure will leave your skin ' glowing ' , while also promising that long - term use will reduce wrinkles , clear acne , and minimize scarring			1
with these claims , the quickie treatment seems perfect on paper - unless that paper is in the mandatory eight - page contract that one client told the @entity26 was like ' a @entity28 novel ' , and includes wording that prepares for the possible death of the client			2
but that has n't stopped skin - obsessed @entity2 from flocking to the @entity11 location			1
then , of course , there are the more fatal risks			0
clients also agree to release their personal information to a funeral director and a coroner ' for identification purposes ' , as well as grant permission for their organs to be donated			1
yet despite such ominous language , fans of the ' addictive ' procedure seem undeterred			0
in fact , the clinic has even had to extend its hours in order to accommodate all of its bookings - and frequent visitors are known to bring in cookies for the staff to thank them for doing such a good job			1
' you can say i ’m hooked , ' @entity75 , 27 , told the @entity26 , adding that he 's been to the clinic about 20 times so far			0
at $ 100 a pop , that 's some pretty pricey skin ' maintenance ' , as mr. @entity75 calls it			0
for regulars like him , however , @entity10 offers bulk - buy packages that are sold at a discount ; mr. @entity75 has a $ 360 - per - month membership that grants him eight treatments			1
booming business : the @entity2 location is the sixth for @entity10 , which also has clinics in @entity94 and @entity95 ' we 're the future of facials , ' said founder @entity99 , 36 , who gets the treatment two or three times a week herself			1
this particular facial is a two - step process , which the clinic says provides a deep clean for skin			1
clients don protective goggles as a nurse runs a laser over their faces twice			2
gel is slathered on the skin , followed by a pulsed light also applied by the nurse			0
in addition to the slightly troubling legal documents each client is required to sign , the treatment itself is not completely free from unpleasant side effects – including an unpleasant smell which a number of clients noted during their first treatment			2
' the laser 's cleaning your face			0
it 's deep cleansing , ' a nurse explains to blogger @entity130 in a video @entity132 took during her treatment			0
' so that 's what your 're smelling			0
' clients may not feel the need to worry about suspicious smells and potential health risks however because , despite the necessity of the waiver , there have been no reported deaths from the procedure so far			2
there have , though , been several claims that the treatment works , and word of mouth has proven a powerful promoter of its benefits			0
skin spa : clients of @entity10 's facial lay down while a nurse uses a laser and pulsing light on their skin her own biggest fan : founder @entity99 , pictured , says she gets her company 's signature skin treatment two to three times a week ' if i had n’t had [ my friend ’s ] testimonial beforehand , i may have backed out [ when i saw the waiver ] , ' said beauty blogger @entity167			1
@entity168 , 33 , added that she has seen an improvement to her acne scars since starting to regularly visit @entity171 : ' after a couple of weeks i was like , " wow ! " ' however , @entity2 - based plastic surgeon dr. @entity173 told the @entity26 that he questions the effectiveness of the treatments , noting that they are n't very powerful if clients need to go so frequently			2
still , @entity171 does have a number of regular customers , allowing the company to expand to a total of six locations , with four in @entity94 and one in @entity183 , @entity95 .			0

@entity10 , a trendy new skin clinic in @entity11 , offers a ten - minute laser facial which promises to tighten skin
