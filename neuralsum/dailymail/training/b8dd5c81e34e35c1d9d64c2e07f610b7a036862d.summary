the @entity2 's largest expanse of water is n't on the surface of the planet , but instead is buried deep within its mantle , researchers have found			1
they claim the ingredients for water are bound up in deep rocks , and scientists believe the discovery may represent the planet 's largest water reservoir			1
deep pockets of magma were found using seismic waves beneath @entity17 , and this magma is said to be a clear sign of water			0
the presence of liquid water on the surface is what makes our ' blue planet ' habitable , and scientists have long been trying to figure out just how much water may be cycling between @entity2 's surface and interior reservoirs through plate tectonics			1
they now believe reservoirs 400 miles under the surface hold the key			2
this water is not in a form familiar to us -- it is not liquid , ice or vapor			0
this fourth form is water trapped inside the molecular structure of the minerals in the mantle rock			2
the weight of 250 miles of solid rock creates such high pressure , along with temperatures above 2,000 degrees @entity50 , that a water molecule splits to form a hydroxyl radical ( @entity53 ) , which can be bound into a mineral 's crystal structure			2
so far , researchers claim they only have evidence the water sits beneath the @entity59 but they plan to carry out further tests to see if it wraps around the entire planet			1
the presence of liquid water on the surface is what makes our ' blue planet ' habitable , and scientists have long been trying to figure out just how much water may be cycling between @entity2 's surface and interior reservoirs through plate tectonics			1
@entity74 geophysicist @entity73 and @entity76 seismologist @entity75 say the findings , to be published june 13 in the journal @entity79 , will aid scientists in understanding how the @entity2 formed , what its current composition and inner workings are and how much water is trapped in mantle rock			1
' geological processes on the @entity2 's surface , such as earthquakes or erupting volcanoes , are an expression of what is going on inside the @entity2 , out of our sight , ' said @entity73 , a co-author of the paper			1
' i think we are finally seeing evidence for a whole - @entity2 water cycle , which may help explain the vast amount of liquid water on the surface of our habitable planet			1
' scientists have been looking for this missing deep water for decades			2
' scientists have long speculated that water is trapped in a rocky layer of the @entity2 's mantle located between the lower mantle and upper mantle , at depths between 250 miles and 410 miles			1
@entity73 and @entity75 are the first to provide direct evidence that there may be water in this area of the mantle , known as the ' transition zone , ' on a regional scale			0
the region extends across most of the interior of the @entity59			0
a diamond - anvil cell ( approximately 5 mm across )			0
between the tips of these gem diamonds , heating experiments on deep - mantle minerals were carried out at conditions similar to 660 km depth , or about 400 miles below the surface			1
@entity75 , an assistant professor of geophysics at the @entity76 , uses seismic waves from earthquakes to investigate the structure of the deep crust and mantle			0
@entity73 , an associate professor of @entity2 and planetary sciences at @entity74 's @entity136 , used observations in the laboratory to make predictions about geophysical processes occurring far beyond our direct observation			2
the study combined @entity73 's lab experiments in which he studies mantle rock under the simulated high pressures of 400 miles below the @entity2 's surface with @entity75 's observations using vast amounts of seismic data from the @entity151 , a dense network of more than 2,000 seismometers across the @entity59			1
this image shows a high - pressure diamond cell of the mineral hydrous ringwoodite , or blue crystal			0
when heated with a laser , a dehydration reaction occured and ringwoodite was transformed to higher pressure minerals			0
that dehydration reaction was observed beneath @entity17 by using seismic waves ' melting of rock at this depth is remarkable because most melting in the mantle occurs much shallower , in the upper 50 miles , ' said @entity75 , a co-author of the paper			0
' if there is a substantial amount of @entity173 in the transition zone , then some melting should take place in areas where there is flow into the lower mantle , and that is consistent with what we found			0
' if just one percent of the weight of mantle rock located in the transition zone is @entity173 , that would be equivalent to nearly three times the amount of water in our oceans , the researchers said			2
@entity75 and @entity73 's findings build on a discovery reported in march in the journal nature in which scientists discovered a piece of the mineral ringwoodite inside a diamond brought up from a depth of 400 miles by a volcano in @entity200			2
that tiny piece of ringwoodite - the only sample in existence from within the @entity2 - contained a surprising amount of water bound in solid form in the mineral			1
fragments of the blue - colored mineral called ringwoodite , synthesized in the laboratory			0
this mineral is thought to exist in the mantle at depths between about 500 and 700 km depth , and act act as a sponge for water ' whether or not this unique sample is representative of the @entity2 's interior composition is not known , however , ' @entity73 said			1
' now we have found evidence for extensive melting beneath @entity17 at the same depths corresponding to the dehydration of ringwoodite , which is exactly what has been happening in my experiments			0
' for the study reported in @entity79 , @entity73 subjected his synthesized ringwoodite to conditions around 400 miles below the @entity2 's surface and found it forms small amounts of partial melt when pushed to these conditions			1
' when a rock with a lot of @entity173 moves from the transition zone to the lower mantle it needs to get rid of the @entity173 somehow , so it melts a little bit , ' @entity75 said			0
' this is called dehydration melting			0
' ' once the water is released , much of it may become trapped there in the transition zone , ' @entity73 added .			0

ingredients for water are bound up in rock deep in the @entity2 's mantle
scientists claim the find may represent the planet 's largest water reservoir
it is believed to cover most of the @entity59 - 400 miles below the surface
researchers will now carry out further tests to discover if the water wraps around the entire planet
