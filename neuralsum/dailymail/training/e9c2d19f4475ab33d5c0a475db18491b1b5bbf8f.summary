with his black notebook in hand , @entity0 started the task of reshaping @entity4 during their 2 - 1 victory over @entity7 on saturday			1
this has been his first full week working with his new charges since replacing @entity10 in charge			0
so what were the first noticeable signs of change from the @entity10 regime ? @entity0 celebrates with a smile after @entity4 beat @entity7 2 - 1 on saturday possession following the @entity18 win over @entity19 last week , @entity0 promised his team will take risks with the ball			1
they certainly lived up to that billing yesterday , keeping the ball on the deck ; looking to play their way out of their defensive third rather than clearing their lines as was often the case under @entity10			0
one passage of play in the 14th minute in particular showed clear signs of @entity0 's influence			0
the long - ball remains an option , but the instructions to keep the ball were fully apparent			0
the @entity4 boss reacts during the second half against @entity7 on saturday evening @entity0 celebrates with his backroom staff during @entity4 's victory over @entity7 @entity46 the diminutive @entity47 was a peripheral figure under @entity10 and @entity49			1
but the playmaker has started both of @entity0 's games at @entity4 and looks like he 's being reintegrated into the club 's first - team plans			1
that , of course , could change when @entity56 returns from international duty , but for now the former @entity59 man is back in the game			0
he was substituted , having been booked in the first - half , and @entity7 took the lead just four minutes later			2
@entity0 celebrating after @entity63 scored the penalty to level the game at 1 - 1 a @entity4 fan with a ' @entity0 here to the rescue ' sign at @entity70 on saturday versatility in attacking @entity10 's @entity4 was based on getting the ball wide to the likes of @entity74 , @entity75 or @entity76 , relying on their pace to get behind opposition			1
there was still an element of that under @entity0 , but without @entity74 , who is on @entity84 duty , @entity4 explored alternative avenues of attack			2
there was crisper passing in front of the @entity7 back - four , the way they carved open the @entity7 back - line for @entity93 's excellent chance in the 35th minute was testament to that			0
it does n't look as if @entity4 will be one trick ponies under @entity0			2
@entity0 applauds the @entity4 fans in @entity70 ahead of kick off against @entity7			1
