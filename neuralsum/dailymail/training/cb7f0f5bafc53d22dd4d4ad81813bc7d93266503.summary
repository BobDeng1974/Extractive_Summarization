a senior @entity0 will today use his @entity2 sermon to liken plans for the legalisation of gay marriage to the way the @entity8 and @entity9 tried to undermine religion			0
the @entity11 will launch a vociferous attack on the @entity14 ’s decision to fast track a vote on same - sex marriage in the @entity17			1
the right reverend @entity18 will use his midnight mass to say marriage can only be between a man and a woman			1
and he will accuse the prime minister of attempting to redefine the institution of marriage for ‘ generations to come ’ without any mandate from the electorate			1
the @entity11 will launch a vociferous attack on the @entity14 's decision to fast track a vote on same - sex marriage in the @entity17 most controversially , he will equate the support for same - sex marriage with the way totalitarian regimes acted in the twentieth century			1
the bishop will say that both @entity35 and @entity36 challenged @entity37 with the notion that what they were doing was ‘ progress ’			1
he will argue that , in a similar fashion , the supporters of same - sex marriage also use the idea of ‘ progress ’ to support the ‘ redefinition ’ of marriage			1
the bishop will conclude : ‘ the @entity49 people have reason to ask on this night where is such progress leading ? ’ and he will tell the faithful that a moment has arrived for them to ‘ stand up for what is right and true as previous generations have done before us : to give witness to the value of every human life , to the truth of marriage as the lasting union of man and woman ... the foundation of family			1
’ in his sermon , @entity67 will say : ‘ past generations have gathered in this cathedral on christmas night amid many shadows which seemed to obscure the future for them			2
we think of the ideologies of the past century , @entity76 and @entity77 , which in living memory threatened to shape and distort the whole future of humanity			0
‘ these inhuman ideologies would each challenge in the name of progress the received @entity37 understanding of the sanctity of human life and the family			1
@entity81 , @entity49 ’s wartime prime minister , a man without clear , religious belief , saw in this deadly struggle nothing less than the defence of @entity37 civilisation			2
the bishop will say that both @entity35 and @entity36 challenged @entity37 with the notion that what they were doing was ' progress ' ‘ few of our political leaders today appear to glimpse the deeper issues when the sanctity of human life and the very identity of marriage , the foundation of the family , are threatened			1
’ he will add : ‘ this @entity2 we are also conscious of new shadows cast by a government that was pledged at its election to support the institution of marriage			2
‘ the prime minister has decided without mandate , without any serious consideration , to redefine the identity of marriage itself , the foundation of the family for all generations to come			2
‘ this is again done in the name of progress			0
the @entity49 people have reason to ask on this night where is such progress leading ? ’ in another part of his sermon , the bishop calls this country ’s treatment of the elderly and sky - high abortion rates ‘ the darkest shadows of our time ’			2
he will say : ‘ the widespread neglect and ill - treatment of the frailest , elderly people in our society : concerns highlighted in the @entity143 ’s recent report			0
the growing concerns about end - of - life care and what is happening to the most vulnerable in our hospitals			0
‘ this dark side to our society is surely connected to the discarding of human life from the beginning in legalised abortion on an industrial scale , in reproductive technologies , in embryo experimentation which our laws have sanctioned			0
’ the bishop ’s comments come despite the fact that polls repeatedly show the public is largely in favour of allowing gay marriage			0
@entity161 , of gay rights group @entity162 , said : ‘ gay people are all too aware of the horrific results of @entity166 ideology due to the countless casualties of the @entity168			0
‘ @entity67 ’s comments are both deeply offensive to gay people and their families			0
’ the @entity14 has tried to defuse @entity173 opposition to its plans by specifically saying it would be illegal for any @entity173 vicar to marry a gay couple .			0
