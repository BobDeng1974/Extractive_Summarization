by @entity0 published : 08:59 est , 14 november 2012 updated : 19:16 est , 14 november 2012 @entity1 has said he refuses to listen to the today programme on @entity3 when it is only presented by men because he finds it too ‘ pompous ’ and ‘ aggressive ’			0
the broadcaster , who co-presented this morning and @entity7 with his wife for 20 years , said he believes tv and radio shows are better when they are presented by both men and women			1
he said : ‘ when i listen to the today in the morning if it ’s two fellows doing it i find it a bit of a turn off			1
i find it a bit one note , rather pompous and it can be very aggressive			2
i find it much more listenable to when it ’s a mixed pairing			2

@entity1 said he refuses to listen to the show when its only presenters are men because he finds it too aggressive ‘ i do n’t listen to the today programme all the time because frankly i find it a rather pompous programme			2
' and i find if you look at regional television news programmes , do n’t you find them less watchable when it ’s two blokes in suits as opposed to when it ’s a man and a woman ? ’ mr @entity1 , 56 , who was speaking about the role of women in broadcasting at the @entity47 in @entity48 , said that he thinks that many women are not as competitive as men			1
he said : ‘ my own wife , who is one of the most successful television presenters in the last 20 or 30 years , is the most reluctant television presenter you can find			1

mr @entity1 said he thinks that many women are not as competitive as men when it comes to broadcasting ' she lacks almost any pushiness or competitiveness			1
taken as a general rule , women are less competitive than men and do not like being competitive with men			2
‘ quite often when there has been pairing of a man and a women , early on in their relationship , it ’s the man who sticks his elbows out , it ’s the man who pinches the " hello , good evening and welcome " line ; it ’s the man who steals the limelight			2
’ he pointed to the example of @entity80 and @entity81 who co-presented @entity82 for two years in the 1990s before she left the programme			0
he said : ‘ i mean , @entity80 was nobody ’s pushover , but @entity81 muscled her out			0
he did it through masculinity and assertiveness and if women are not prepared to get out they do get pushed to one side			0
’ @entity1 , left , believes @entity91 , pictured right , set back gender equality because of the way she was derided for being a strong woman mr @entity1 said the success of his broadcasting partnership with his wife of 26 years is because of their rules about taking turns			1
he said : ‘ we had a very conscious policy of being equal and not to be played off against each other			0
because we were married and loved each other we had rules , so if i opened @entity106 on monday she would open on tuesday			0
' it kept the peace and it kept the balance			0
from time to time a producer would say " @entity7 , i think you should do this interview with so - and - so " and i ’d say " no , we ’ll do it together " or " no , it ’s @entity117 ’s turn			1
" ' @entity117 was always more popular and you could just tell that when we went out			2
women viewers loved @entity117 , they kind of put up with me , but they loved @entity117			1
' he added that he believed that @entity91 had set back women ’s equality because of the way she was derided for being a strong woman			1
he said : ‘ i do think a lot of the sexism that @entity91 had to put up with , with expressions such as handbagging , was appalling and really damaging to women			1
' in many ways i think her premiership was counter-productive in terms of women as strong figures as she was derided for being a strong woman			0
‘ whatever you thought of her politics she was a hugely effective female politician			0

presenter thinks many female broadcasters lack ' competitive ' *instinct*
@entity117 is ' the most reluctant television presenter you can find '
he also believes @entity91 set back women ’s equality
