overwhelmed parents no longer need to feel guilty for desperately wanting a moment of peace and quiet			2
mothers and fathers are sharing hilarious photos of their parenting blunders and apologizing to their babies on a ' shame - free ' website started by a @entity10 mom who found herself laughing about the everyday realities associated with raising a child			1
humor writer @entity13 , who has a 22 - month - old daughter and another child on the way , came up with the idea for @entity18 after the birth of her baby girl			1
' and one time when she was nursing i had this thought that i wished she would hurry up and finish so i could have a glass of wine			2
' the thought made her laugh and immediately want to apologize to her baby			2
it was after that moment that ms @entity13 started keeping a running list of all the inappropriate parenting thoughts that ran through her head on any given day			1
it occurred to that she was n't alone in her thinking , and her desire to brighten another parent 's day led to the creation of @entity18			1
' i thought , if i 'm thinking these un-pc things , other moms must be thinking them too , ' she wrote in an essay for @entity81 last week			0
and i bet they could use a laugh			0
' ms @entity13 started posting the funny ' @entity85 ' photos on @entity86 before she created her website			1
she also shares pictures and apologies on her site 's @entity91 and @entity92 accounts			1
