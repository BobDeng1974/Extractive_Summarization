by @entity0 follow @ @ lauriewhitwell @entity1 was serenaded with a chorus of ‘ @entity3 ’ from adoring @entity5 fans as his return to the @entity7 finished in a comfortable victory over ramshackle @entity9			1
@entity10 and @entity11 scored the first - half goals that made this afternoon bathed in sunshine a walk in the park against a team able to name a squad of only 15 players			2
in an humiliating indictment of all that is wrong at @entity9 , brought about by a chairman in @entity22 who appears averse to opening his wallet and a manager in @entity25 who refused to budge on transfer targets , only one outfield player with senior experience was named on the bench			1
subs : @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52			2
goals : @entity44 25 , @entity11 30 @entity9 : @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 ( @entity63 87 ) , @entity64 , @entity65			1
subs : @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69			2
att : 28,028 irate @entity9 fans chanted ‘ we want @entity22 out , ’ before kick - off as his shambolic reign revealed its consequences with @entity76 ’s team selection			1
the @entity77 named only four substitutes , two of whom , in @entity82 and @entity83 , were teenagers promoted from the youth team with no senior matches			2
only @entity85 , a 21 - year - old defender with 50 league games to his name at @entity88 , offered @entity76 an outfield option with any experience			2
in the end @entity83 did make his debut late on			2
all this despite a flurry of transfer activity since it became clear a fortnight ago that having eight players on the books would be suicidal			2
@entity25 was hampered yesterday by having seven players out , two through work permit issues , while striker @entity101 , released by @entity5 this summer , was not registered in time despite signing on wednesday			1
commendably , @entity101 decided to watch the match from the stands with his fans			0
it would be laughable were it not so serious			0
it meant nine debutants for the visitors , all signed for nothing or on loan			2
captain @entity55 is a player who only signed in january			0
the @entity113 are a club built on foundations of sand right now			0
@entity1 named six debutants himself , although these were players bought for significant fees with a tilt at promotion to the @entity121 in mind			1
@entity123 cost a club - record £ 5million fee			0
it is doubtful that much has been spent by @entity127 on recruitment since @entity9 fell from the top - flight in 2011 , pocketing more than £ 70m in parachute payments in the process			1
these clubs do share a common theme of course ; @entity1 has not seen eye - to - eye with his hierarchy either			0
the manager who runs a mile from a euphemism , went public when @entity36 and @entity140 were sold to @entity141 behind his back this week			0
tap in : @entity10 slides home the opening goal for @entity1 's side against depleted @entity9 homecoming : @entity1 applauds the crowd at the @entity7 ahead of the opening day victory trouble : @entity62 looked a dejected figure as he walked off at half - time with pool 2 - 0 down absolute shambles ! @entity25 had five new signings unavailable after the club did n't register them but he subsequently clarified that his issue was less with @entity156 owner @entity155 and more the financial people for failing to keep him informed			1
@entity5 got £ 7m and both players loaned back for the season			1
‘ very good business , ’ @entity1 concluded			0
@entity36 started this match in goal			0
what @entity76 would do for such problems			0
amid such circumstances , a 2 - 0 defeat for @entity9 is not an embarrassment			1
they were surprisingly well - organised and stifled @entity5 for decent periods			1
indeed , the first clear chance went their way when @entity59 ’s inswinging free - kick found the head of @entity65			0
but the former @entity177 man put it wide with the goal at his mercy			0
@entity5 ’s quality and preparation told in the end , and @entity1 will be warmed two of his summer signings scored the goals			1
in the 25th minute @entity43 advanced will the ball and unleashed a trademark strike from ards that clipped the inside of the post with @entity9 goalkeeper @entity54 stranded			1
@entity44 , signed for £ 1.5m this week from @entity192 , arrived at the perfect moment to slot home the rebound			0
@entity1 , a legendary figure here after 12 years as a player , celebrated with a fist - pump			0
blink and you 'll miss it ! @entity54 was powerless to stop @entity11 's effort flying over him tussling for possession : @entity44 tries to skip beyond @entity9 striker @entity65 five minutes later the tally was doubled			1
@entity11 , who moved from @entity205 on a free , cut in from the right and curled a delicious strike from the angle of the area that flew into the far corner			0
‘ @entity3 , give us a wave , ’ the jubilant home fans chanted			0
@entity44 could have added another but his shot , after excellent work from @entity34 , was held by @entity54 and after the break @entity46 did everything but score			0
his pace offered @entity5 an outlet from the back and his presence a focal point for crosses into the box			1
@entity9 , an assorted bunch who were mostly strangers to each other before the past week , kept their shape admirably and @entity59 went close with a shot curled round the post			1
but as the match ebbed away the travelling contingent once more chanted : ‘ we want @entity22 out ’			0
the @entity9 chairman could not hear , he was not in attendance – rumoured to be abroad in even sunnier surroundings .			1

@entity25 named just four players on the bench for the visitors
@entity9 failed to register five new signings in time for the opening day
@entity5 were comfortable throughout at the @entity7
