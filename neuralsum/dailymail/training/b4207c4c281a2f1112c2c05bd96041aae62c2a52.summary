a seaside town with 40,000 residents has become the charity shop capital of @entity3 where bus - loads of people visit just to hunt for bargains in 24 stores crammed into three of its main streets			1
tourists heading for a cheap shopping spree in @entity12 , @entity13 , are even handed maps highlighting the locations of charity outlets - some of which have more than one store			1
but while charity shops in the town are thriving , and multiplying , independent businesses say they are going bust because of crippling rents - with three closing in the past week alone			1
in the @entity26 charities get business rate relief , which means they automatically escape paying 80 per cent , with the possibility of the remaining 20 per cent also being waived at the local council 's discretion			1
packed streets : @entity12 has become the charity shop capital of @entity3 with an extraordinary 24 stores concentrated in three main streets closing sale : bestsellers owner @entity37 is admitting defeat in @entity12 after running his business for almost eight years - and is planning to run a charity shop himself in total there are nine charity shops in @entity44 , eight in @entity45 , five in @entity46 and two more in adjacent streets			1
yet in the same streets the closing down boards have gone up outside the book store bestsellers with owner @entity37 admitting defeat after running his business for almost eight years			0
@entity51 vintage clothes and @entity53 have also decided to shut down			0
mr @entity37 says he is going to take a job managing a charity shop in the town instead admitting : ' i have n't been able to beat them so i 'm joining them			0
' he said : ' i just ca n't carry on beyond the end of january and most independent owners are in the same precarious state			0
' when i set my business up there were around ten charity shops in the town			1
i knew i would n't become a millionaire but i wanted to provide a service and make a modest living			0
' now every other shop seems to be a charity shop and there are 24 charity shops in three streets , with at least four more coming soon and it is driving the rest of us under			1
' i have nothing against these charities , they do a great job			0
but it is nothing like a level playing field and the rest of us just ca n't get by anymore			0
it 's heartbreaking but i have no alternative but to throw in the towel			0
' western road : this busy street in the centre of @entity12 has an astonishing nine charity shops			1
@entity94 , @entity95 and @entity96 share the street with @entity98 , @entity26 , @entity99 , @entity100 , the @entity101 and @entity102 mr @entity37 says he needs to make £ 70 - a - day to cover his £ 12,000 - a - year rates bill			2
but now he is lucky if he makes £ 30 from the trickle of customers who scour the charity shops instead for cut price deals on donated books			1
he says coach parties regularly arrive packed with foraging shoppers from neighbouring towns because @entity12 now has the reputation as the @entity26 mecca for charity shops offering bargain clothes , ornaments , homeware and rare books at every turn			1
they have even specially printed maps to find the charity shop of their choice			2
mr @entity37 said : ' what will i do ? i will take the only job in town at the moment - working as a manager in charity shop			0
' i have n't been able to beat them so i 'm joining them			0
' a few doors away from bestsellers the closing down boards have also gone up at @entity138 ladies and gents vintage clothes shop , a fixture for decades in the town			0
the current owner is giving up after six years of increasing competition from charities			0
@entity45 : this thoroughfare has eight well - used charity shops in the south coast town			1
@entity149 , the @entity150 charity shop and @entity151 share the street with @entity153			0
@entity154 , two @entity156 ’s hospice shops and a mind shop in the next street a long established gift card shop has also become a january victim of the burgeoning number of charity shops			1
it will soon be converted to yet another charity outlet			0
there has been at least a 30 per cent increase in the number of charity shops on the high street			1
the explosion since the economic crash in 2008 is leading to fears of the creation of ‘ charity clone towns ’ across @entity3 , with conventional retailers being forced out			0
there are believed to be at least 10,000 charity shops and they pay a fraction of the £ 7 billion annual business rates of traditional retailers , giving them a considerable financial advantage over other stores			1
that has driven the proliferation of charity shops			2
but it has also contributed to a rise in business rate relief given to charities , up 73 per cent to £ 1.3 billion over five years			2
they are also attractive to landlords , who avoid paying the business rate , while the charity can claim relief on it			2
@entity198 , chairman of the voluntary @entity199 that works for both traders and shoppers , said : ' i certainly do n't think we want any more charity shops here			2
' other businesses are not getting the government 's 80 per cent rate relief the charities do so charity shops can afford higher rents and be in better locations because they get this present from the government			1
' and if you are part of a big charity , effectively a national chain , they are cash rich in comparison to the independent traders they compete against			0
' are helping by attracting more shoppers			0
@entity224 of the @entity101 , who have two shops in @entity12 , explained : ' i do n't think we have an unfair advantage			2
' the charity shops do bring more people into the town and we can all work alongside each other			2
' and we rely on our shops to help us provide the care and support to patients with cancer and other life threatening illnesses			0
without our shops it would be very difficult			0
' but now traders and civic leaders in the @entity96 resort of @entity12 have demanded an end to the explosion of charity stores they say is having a disastrous effect on long established businesses			1
they claim they can no longer cope with the growing competition that has seen 24 charity shops open in a cramped town centre of just three main streets - with yet more expected to open up in the coming months			1
@entity46 road : this street has the fewest number of charity shops in @entity12 - five - with another two in neighbouring streets			1
@entity26 and @entity259 are neighbours of @entity261 , @entity262 ( not pictured ) and the @entity263 but @entity264 , chief executive at the @entity265 , who steps down this month , has regularly defended his members			0
he said previously : ‘ charity shops do not compete unfairly with commercial firms			2
all charity shops pay standard market rates for rents and utilities just like other commercial ventures			1
‘ many of the charities benefiting from the funds raised through shops are local hospices or other organisations whose beneficiaries are in the local community			2

tourists are handed maps *detailing* where @entity12 's charity shops are
charities are given at least 80 *%* off business rates if they rent stores
local businesses say they are going bust while charity shops thrive
in @entity12 there are 24 charity shops and more planned in the coming year
three independent shops have gone out of business in the past week
