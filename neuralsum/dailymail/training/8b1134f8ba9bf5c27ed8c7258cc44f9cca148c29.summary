when environmentalist @entity1 spotted an articulate and well - built eco warrior sitting opposite her at a meeting of anarchists , she was touched by how he appeared ‘ the perfect blueprint ’ for the kind of man she was looking for			1
others in that @entity13 pub told how @entity14 had for five years waged an anarchic war as a hunt saboteur , been pivotal at @entity18 food protests and even travelled to @entity19 for a weekend of demonstrations			0
these were , the young woman thought , the impressive credentials of a dedicated environmental campaigner			2
deceit : @entity26 officer @entity25 ( left ) married an activist , and @entity28 ( right ) used the name @entity30 a month later , they met in another pub and @entity1 and @entity33 became lovers			1
the following year they moved in together in a flat and began what she thought was ‘ a blissfully in love relationship ’			2
but , as the months went by , @entity1 began to realise that this reserved man did not seem as committed or as knowledgeable about ‘ the cause ’ as she had first thought			0
yesterday , the @entity26 confirmed that ‘ @entity33 ’ was in fact @entity25 , 43 , an undercover officer who had infiltrated anarchist and hard - line environmental groups to glean intelligence and disrupt their activities			1
he began working undercover in the mid- 1990s after serving in the @entity26 ’s anti-terrorism unit			2
senior police also named @entity28 , an undercover officer who used the name @entity30 and who fathered a son with a female activist before later abandoning them			1
the decision formally to name the officers follows a ruling by a high court judge who said the @entity26 could no longer hide behind its insistence that it could ‘ neither confirm nor deny ’ the identities of the men at the centre of allegations brought by women claiming they were ‘ tricked ’ into having sexual relationships with officers			1
the @entity26 claimed its policy was for the safety of officers working undercover			2
it is the latest twist in an ever - more controversial legal dispute centring on the police ’s use of undercover officers and the tactics they employ with women in particular			1
the woman who had a child with @entity28 – who prefers only to be named as @entity80 – told the @entity81 yesterday that she suspected undercover officers used sex as a ‘ tactical option ’			1
she is currently bringing a legal claim against the @entity26			0
‘ i will never know if @entity28 ’s “ feelings ” for me were “ genuine ” whilst we were in a relationship , as the police now say they were , but with hindsight , that must be irrelevant , ’ she said			1
‘ what is significant is @entity28 ’s reasons for entering into the relationship with me and his reasons for ending it and leaving me to bring up our son alone			1
i believe that i was used , that i was just a tactical option and part of their operation			0
’ @entity28 , who had infiltrated animal rights groups , was said to have had sexual relations with four women , including @entity80 , whom he met at an animal rights party			1
that was in the 1980s , and he left her when their son was two			0
holes : @entity25 's wife said holes began to emerge in his political views and started becoming reserved he is also the detective named by barrister @entity116 ’s review of the @entity118 murder case			1
@entity116 wrote that he was one of three officers alleged to have been involved in a plot to gather ‘ fascinating and valuable intelligence ’ from an undercover officer who was spying on the @entity118 family and their supporters			2
@entity127 of @entity129 solicitors , which represents @entity80 , along with other women bringing claims against the @entity26 , said the decision to name officers would do little to restore public confidence in the force			2
there are currently ten women seeking compensation , with claims against four officers for deceit , assault , negligence and malfeasance in public office			2
this begs the question of whether an undercover officer who has sex with members of the group he has infiltrated is , as @entity80 claims , employing a tactical option , simply sees it as a ‘ perk ’ of the job or , as the @entity26 says , is merely succumbing to genuine feelings of mutual attraction			1
to understand how officers can become so involved with women , you must comprehend how consuming living a double life can be			2
they are each provided with a ‘ legend ’ or cover story			0
senior officers last year admitted that the identities of dead babies had even been used			0
the police spies get a passport and credit cards , as well as generous funds to be able to bribe people			0
they are also given a telephone with a tracking device so handlers can always trace them if they get into trouble			0
@entity28 recently admitted appearing in a magistrates ’ court for a ‘ minor public offence ’ , but used his fake name to maintain cover			1
but is pairing off with a girlfriend from within the group they are infiltrating essential to their cover ? in an interview with the @entity189 , @entity1 said she began to question @entity25 ’s commitment to the cause while they were living as a couple			1
he showed a lack of commitment , she said , to environmental campaigns			2
he was , she said , ‘ under - developed ideologically ’ and there were ‘ holes in his political development ’			0
his increasingly reserved behaviour led to him being called ‘ @entity202 ’			0
also , his almost military attention to cleaning his boots led @entity1 to ponder whether he was in fact an imposter			0
he later announced he was leaving to hitchhike to @entity207			0
he vanished , perhaps to return to a desk in @entity209			0
tactics ? the women @entity28 and @entity25 duped question whether they were tactical or ' a perk of the job ' she tried tracking him down , and the pair met by chance in a bookshop , where he admitted to being a police officer			1
despite this revelation , they maintained a relationship while living apart and had two children			0
they married in 2005 but divorced a few years later			0
@entity25 remains a serving officer in the @entity26			1
yesterday , another woman who had a relationship with an undercover officer , @entity229 , rounded on the suggestion that officers had affairs because of genuine feelings			1
‘ it ’s a load of rubbish , ’ she said			0
‘ how can you have a genuine relationship that ’s based on a complete web of lies ? they knew that their posting was going to be ending in just a few years , and that they were going to disappear from our lives and leave us bereft			0
that ’s not love – that is abuse			0
’ this former anti-capitalist protester with @entity249 said her world ‘ fell apart ’ after she discovered her former partner had a fake identity			0
mr @entity127 says : ‘ the compelling body of evidence that police officers systematically used sexual relationships with women to build their cover stories contradicts the “ rogue officer in love myth ” that is being offered to the public			1
’ until these emotionally - charged legal battles have been resolved , it remains to be seen whether the police will regret giving @entity25 a letter of commendation while he was an undercover officer for his ‘ outstanding devotion to duty and determination over extended period in the investigation of serious crime ’ .			1

@entity25 and @entity28 posed as *eco-warriors* undercover
both had affairs with ' targets ' , @entity28 fathered a child and @entity25 married
the men had infiltrated environmental protest groups in the 80s and 90s
women say they were duped into relationships - men say they were in love
