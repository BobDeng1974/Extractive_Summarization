the new @entity1 season is nearly upon us and @entity3 have already made their move to stand out from the crowd with a gigantic selfie of their main football pundits			0
the picture , taken at @entity11 , included the likes of former @entity14 trio @entity13 , @entity15 and @entity16 , all of whom were pictured together for the first time for the company			1
@entity13 will feature far less frequent than the likes of retired duo @entity15 and @entity16 though , as he continues his playing career with newly - promoted @entity24			2
@entity25 time : @entity26 took the photo which included the likes of @entity13 , @entity15 and @entity16 competitor : @entity3 will face stiff competition from @entity31 this season the selfie , which included many others who work for the company , was taken by @entity3 presenter @entity26			1
with huge competitors in the shape of @entity31 and @entity37 , the addition of @entity14 legend @entity16 will come as a huge boost to the company as they embark on their second full season since being formed			0
@entity31 's exceptional coverage of the @entity43 in @entity44 has no doubt prompted @entity3 into action , and the arrival of @entity16 could well be a similar one to when @entity48 first joined @entity37			0
dream team ( from left ) ? @entity16 , @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity13 , @entity26 , @entity53 and @entity15 all smiles ( from left ) : @entity13 , @entity52 and @entity15 busy man : @entity13 will combine his two punditry roles for @entity3 and @entity31 with his player role at @entity24 well - respected : @entity16 was an outstanding asset on the pitch and will look to be the exact same off it too @entity3 will be looking to follow - up on a encouraging first season , with the channel still free for any @entity65 customers			1
they still find themselves quite a way behind @entity37 in particular though , but do hope to pip them to the right to screen @entity70 football from next season with a new @entity73 contract up for graps			0
with highly - respected and high - profile figures like @entity13 and @entity16 continuing their work for the company the future can only be bright for @entity3 .			2

the former @entity14 team - mates were part of the @entity3 selfie
@entity13 will continue his roles with both @entity31 and @entity3 when he is free from his on - field *duties* with @entity24
@entity15 will carry on as a *co-commentator* for @entity3
@entity16 has *recently* joined the company as a football pundit
@entity3 face *increased* competition from the likes of @entity31
