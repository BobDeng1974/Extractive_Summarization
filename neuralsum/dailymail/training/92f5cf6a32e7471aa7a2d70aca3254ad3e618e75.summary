according to backstage sources @entity0 , 19 , was in a foul mood after waking up late because of a night out and the ' stroppy youngster locked himself in his dressing room to play computer games '			1

it was a really uncomfortable atmosphere			0
his attitude was , " i ’m the star and i can do what i want " '			0
another worker , @entity29 , said : ' i hope i never have to experience so many upset children and disappointed fans again			0

diva : a source close to the star told @entity35 magazine that the @entity42 threw a tantrum before the monday night show at the @entity3 @entity45 : despite fans complaining , @entity0 still maintains he was only 40 minutes late to stage curious : wearing two expensive watches it 's a wonder how @entity0 could n't see he was late to his own concert another backstage source added : ' his lateness was because he did n’t get out of bed until late and sat in his dressing room playing games - even though his door was being knocked			1
' ' he then threw a strop as he said he wanted a shower first , despite already being late			0
' it is thought @entity0 arrived at the @entity61 at 3pm ' to do some meet and greets ' but he was suffering after a ' heavy night at his hotel			2
but the great audience at the @entity3 were n't the only ones to be disappointed			1

however , when their idol finally arrived , they say he spent ' less than ten seconds ' with him			2
she also claims the singer declined to give her a hug , ironically telling his fan ' i do n't have time			1
' a source close to @entity0 said : ' there was no competition winner that we knew or approved of			1
' ' if it was a radio contest winner who got a meet and greet , they got the same amount of time as everyone else and exactly what was promised			0
' the rest of the accounts are ' wildly exaggerated or just untrue			1
' party does n't stop ! after his show , @entity0 heads out for another ' good time ' in @entity101 even an @entity3 staff member witnessed @entity0 's alleged diva - like behaviour : ' he was arguing with members of his management , his family			1
it was a really uncomfortable atmosphere			0
his attitude was , " i ’m the star and i can do what i want "			0
' despite a wealth of attendees confirming his two hour delay to stage , the @entity42 star still maintains he only kept his fans waiting for 40 minutes			2
still popular : @entity0 was presented with an official @entity117 this week after playing the stadium last year , causing his fans to record the loudest scream during the @entity120 ' last night i was scheduled after 3 opening acts to go on stage at 935 not 830 but because of some technical issues i got on at 10:10			2
. so ... ( sic ) ' the singer tweeted			0
@entity126 also reported that the star is being asked to pay a £ 300,000 fine to @entity128 for causing the gig to run past the 11pm closing time			0
however , a @entity132 spokesperson said : ' [ we ] have not taken any action against the owners of @entity3 in relation to @entity0 ’s recent performance , as no breach of our licensing conditions took place			1
' @entity141 : @entity0 visited @entity142 on monday to be honoured with his official @entity117 following his loudest scream recorded at a concert there last year ' i never have any intent to upset or let anyone down			0
and @entity149 not okay with things being exaggerated			0
once again sorry for anyone upset			0
( sic ) ' but to ensure the backlash did n't continue , the following night 's performance saw @entity0 arrive on stage two minutes early , according to his official @entity156 page			1
however it seems the furore has n't dampened the @entity161 's singer 's feelings towards the @entity163 capital , tweeting a simple message in the early hours of wednesday : ' @entity101			2
