it was the most heartbreaking tragedy of the floods that wreaked havoc around @entity3 last year			0
little @entity4 died at home – in the middle of the night – after being poisoned by gas			1
for months after his death , police and other official agencies ruled out fears that the deadly fumes had come from a nearby landfill site			1
instead , they insisted carbon monoxide from a faulty pump hired by his family had caused his death			1
but now @entity19 can reveal the damning evidence that proves the authorities have known for 14 months that hydrogen cyanide gas capable of killing @entity4 had leaked into the family 's home as it was engulfed by floodwater			1
the witness statements , marked restricted and confidential , were provided to police by senior fire officers the day after they attended the scene of the tragedy on february 8 last year			0
but @entity4 's grieving parents @entity57 and @entity59 have faced a ' wall of silence ' , leading to claims of a cover - up while public agencies repeatedly insisted the boy died from carbon monoxide poisoning and that there was no risk to the wider public			1
local residents accused the authorities of lying and putting lives at risk			0
the @entity74 ' neighbour , @entity73 , 53 , said last night : ' it is a disgrace that the authorities have not warned people about the dangers lurking in this land near our homes			0
dr @entity81 , an expert in landfill gases , said last night that it was possible the cyanide gas had leached from a nearby landfill site ( pictured ) ' they are hoping it will go away – but it wo n't			1
it should not have taken the loss of a young life for this to come to light			0
continuing to lie to people about what is there is putting other lives at risk			0
' we have said all along that they found hydrogen cyanide at @entity57 and @entity59 's house and here is the proof			1
' just hours after the tragedy , despite the fact that police were in constant communication with fire chiefs , @entity51 police chief superintendent @entity104 declared that landfill gases were ' not one of our lines of inquiry ' into @entity4 's death			1
the force spent the next 11 months investigating carbon monoxide poisoning as the cause , before dropping its case in january on advice from the @entity120 that there was no case to answer in relation to a hired petrol - powered pump in the family 's home which they insist was never switched on			1
@entity59 and @entity128 also needed hospital treatment because of hydrogen cyanide exposure on the night of their son 's death			1
for months after his death , police and other official agencies ruled out fears that the deadly fumes had come from a nearby landfill site @entity57 , 48 , has been permanently paralysed from the waist down because of the gas , which was used to murder millions in the @entity143 death camps			1
the couple have struggled for answers from the police , @entity39 , @entity40 and councils ever since – and are still waiting for a coroner 's inquest to be held because of the delays caused by the long - running police investigation			0
the @entity19 has led the way in covering the tragic case – but has been stonewalled at every turn			0
now this newspaper has seen leaked statements from police interviews with senior firefighters who were among the first of dozens of emergency personnel on the scene when @entity4 was rushed to hospital			2
the highly experienced officers serve with @entity165 and monitoring team , which is called in to investigate gases			0
a commanding officer 's statement to police says : ' as we were about to leave the premises , one of the gas detectors went into an amber alarm indicating hydrogen cyanide had been detected at levels of ten parts per million			1
' the officer says the level of gas in the house is considered dangerous if inhaled for more than 15 minutes			1
an immediately fatal concentration is 50 parts per million			0
fire crews fled the riverside home in @entity50 , @entity51 ( pictured ) for their own safety after their specialist gas detectors sounded the alarm for dangerous levels of hydrogen cyanide the reading was taken at 7.29am – four hours after @entity4 's mother found him unconscious in a bedroom above the hallway and rang 999			1
after @entity4 was found , emergency services had opened doors and windows to ventilate the property for several hours			2
the firefighters double - checked their equipment and re-entered the house on two more occasions to confirm that hydrogen cyanide was in the property at ' concentrated levels ' , according to their incident log			1
it records the gas being detected at 7.47am and 8.19am			0
@entity211 mr @entity73 recalled seeing the firefighters ' ducking in and out of the house in breathing apparatus			0
' he said : ' the fire chief said to me there was hydrogen cyanide			2
i asked if it was ground gases and he said that was right and everyone will have to go to hospital			0
' another statement seen by this newspaper says the gas detectors used by the fire service had been tested and certified as working correctly four days before @entity4 's death			1
the @entity230 said last night that they could not comment on the fire service documents for legal reasons ahead of @entity4 's inquest , due to be held later this year			2
a close family friend said : ' the truth is out – they have been gassed			0
@entity57 and @entity59 are very angry			0
' dr @entity81 , an expert in landfill gases , said last night that it was possible the cyanide gas had leached from the landfill site			1
he added : ' if this was an old unregulated tip , it could well be that cyanides were dumped many years ago			0
if there is acid spilt at the site , and then the water came out due to the flooding , then that would bring acid to the cyanide and release hydrogen cyanide			2
' this newspaper asked @entity255 why the force had not disclosed that it knew hydrogen cyanide had been detected in the family 's home hours after @entity4 had died			1
we also asked why the force spent 11 months investigating the carbon monoxide theory			2
a spokesman did not answer those questions but said in a statement : ' in february 2014 , the post mortem examination into @entity4 's death proved inconclusive			2
' further thorough and extensive tests were completed			0
the pathologist gave a result of carbon monoxide intoxication			2
' the police , @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity273 , @entity274 and @entity275 all said they could not comment in detail ahead of the coroner 's inquest			0
a spokeswoman for @entity275 council said : ' we are aware it is the family 's belief that there is a link between the landfill close to their home and the tragic death of their son			2
' however , based on current information , we do not believe there is any evidence of a causal link			0
