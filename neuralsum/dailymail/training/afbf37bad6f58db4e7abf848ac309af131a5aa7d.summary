@entity6 said the world was created in seven days as explained in the @entity12 , while @entity3 argued that the earth resulted from the big bang and teaching children otherwise would lead to @entity17 's demise as a world power			1
' if we continue to eschew science ... we are not going to move forward , ' @entity3 said			2
' we will not embrace natural laws			2
we will not make discoveries			2
we will not invent and innovate and stay ahead			2
it was estimated that more than a million people streamed the debate online and 900 people were in the audience the debate took place tuesday night to a packed house of 900 at the @entity32 in @entity33 , @entity34 - which @entity6 founded			1

the show ran from 1993 to 1998 after five - minute opening statements , both @entity6 and @entity3 had half an hour to give prepared speeches on how they believe @entity61 originated , backing their arguments with photos and charts			1
the tame debate was moderated by @entity68 reporter @entity67 , who rarely interrupted the pair , and the audience was mostly quiet except to applaud the debaters at the end of their speeches			0
during his argument , @entity6 stressed that there exists a difference between ' observational science ' and ' historical science '			1

but @entity3 countered that argument , saying that the natural laws observed today hold just as true in the past			0
@entity3 points to evidence like @entity91 ice cores that have recorded seasonal highs and lows in temperatures dating back 680,000 years to disprove @entity6 's argument that the @entity61 was created just 6,000 years ago			1
and if the @entity97 really happened as explained in the story of @entity99 , there should be @entity100 in the @entity101 or between there and @entity102			0
in the end , @entity3 said it was fine to have faith in a religion but that does n't mean you ca n't believe in scientific theories as well			0
' i just want to remind us all there are billions of people in the world who are deeply religious , who get enriched by the wonderful sense of community by their religion , ' @entity3 said			0
' but these same people do not embrace the extraordinary view that the @entity61 is somehow only 6,000 years old			0
' @entity6 argued a similar sentiment , pointing to several famous scientists who have publically stated that they believe in creation - including @entity126 inventor @entity125			1
' i believe the word ' science ' has been hijacked by secularists , ' @entity6 said			1
@entity130 of @entity131 , @entity132 drove the 12 hours to @entity34 with her son to see the talk , and said the debate was impossible to win ' i think the believers will stay believers , ' ms @entity130 told @entity138			0
' no one 's going to walk out of here saying , " i changed my mind			0
" that 's not going to work			0
' attraction : the @entity32 was founded seven years ago and since then half a million people have visited the $ 35million facility in @entity33 , @entity34 while many on @entity150 expressed the opinion that @entity3 won the debate , academics who believe in evolution say in the end @entity3 only helped @entity6 publicize his museum			1
the museum is currently fundraising to build a $ 60million @entity99 theme park in @entity157 , @entity34 but was previously having a hard time getting the project going			0
' @entity3 's appearance will be giving money to organizations who try to subvert the mission @entity3 has had all his life : science education , particularly of kids , ' @entity160 , professor of ecology and evolution at the @entity162 wrote on his blog			2
@entity3 and @entity6 had never met before the debate last night , though museum officials say @entity3 showed up outside once to take a picture and never came in			1

' i say to the grown - ups , if you want to deny evolution and live in your world , in your world that 's completely inconsistent with everything we observe in the universe , that 's fine , ' @entity3 said in the video			0
