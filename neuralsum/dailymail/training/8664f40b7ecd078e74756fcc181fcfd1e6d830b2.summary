by @entity0 published : 12:29 est , 25 february 2013 updated : 14:03 est , 25 february 2013 children as young as 10 are at risk of skin cancer by using sunbeds , a worrying report has found			1
a survey of salon operators in @entity8 shows that 65 per cent would allow youngsters aged 10 to 12 - years - old to use tanning beds			1
this is despite strong evidence that sunbed use can increase the risk of the most deadly form of skin cancer - melanoma - by 75 per cent			1
children are at greater risk of doing long - term damage than adults as they have thinner , more delicate skin			1
children are at greater risk from sunbeds as they have thinner , more delicate skin than adults @entity29 use is banned among under - 18s in the @entity31 as a result , although recent research revealed teenagers are regularly flouting it			1
@entity36 is the only @entity37 state with a similar law			1
meanwhile , @entity8 is one of 17 states that has no minimum age restrictions on sunbed use and does not require parental consent			0
co-author @entity44 , of @entity45 , said : ' with the absence of logical age restrictions , we are failing to protect our children , who are at an increased risk of developing skin cancer when exposed to the high - intensity levels of ultraviolet light that can be received in a tanning bed			1
' @entity29 users are up to 2.5 times more likely to develop more common non-melanoma skin cancers , such as basal cell and squamous cell cancers			2
the @entity59 has stated that people younger than 18 should not use tanning beds , a recommendation based on several scientific studies			0
dr @entity44 says she and her colleagues at the @entity66 routinely see young , female , melanoma patients who report previous tanning bed use			0
' indoor tanning may seem innocuous at first , ' she says			0
' due to what is called ' tumor lag time , ' or the time between an exposure to a carcinogen such as ultraviolet and the development of a cancer , it may take a decade or longer for someone who has been exposed to artificial ultraviolet radiation from tanning beds to develop a skin cancer			2
' melanoma on the skin : around 62,000 people in the @entity37 are diagnosed with this most dangerous form each year for the study , published online in the journal @entity89 , researchers identified 831 indoor tanning facilities across @entity8 and randomly selected and called 375 of them , posing as prospective clients			2
for consistency , the researchers made attempts to survey each salon twice			0
operators of 65 per cent of the participating facilities said they would allow children as young as 10 or 12 to use indoor - tanning devices			1
employees at 43 per cent claimed there were no risks associated with sunbed , and 80 per cent of facility operators said indoor tanning would prevent future sunburn			0
both claims are false , the study notes			0
the @entity109 has deemed ultraviolet rays from the sun and artificial tanning devices as carcinogenic to humans , equivalent to tobacco			0
' minimizing exposure to ultraviolet rays , no matter the source , lowers one 's risk of skin cancer , ' says dr @entity121 , a cancer prevention expert at @entity45 and the @entity66 who was n't involved in the study			2
' the problem with indoor tanning is that users start very young and , unlike the sun , tanning beds are a completely avoidable cancer risk			0
' he added they should protect themselves from sun exposure using hats , long - sleeve shirts and suncream .			2

survey revealed two thirds of salon operators in @entity37 state would allow kids as young as 10 to use sunbeds
@entity29 use increases the risk of most deadly form of skin cancer by up to 75 *%*
children are at greater risk of doing long - term damage as they have thinner , more delicate skin
