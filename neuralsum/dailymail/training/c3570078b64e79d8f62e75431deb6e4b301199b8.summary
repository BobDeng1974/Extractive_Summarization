by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor @entity2 has accepted her husband @entity4 's philandering ways but told him that ' when we are back in the @entity6 , he 'll have to behave , ' according to a new book by former @entity9 editor @entity8			1
that 's ' when , ' not ' if			0
' but @entity2 's apparent certainty about her presidential plans has taken a back seat in reviews of the book , ' @entity16 , ' to accounts of vicious backbiting between the @entity19 and the @entity20			1
even tales of exploits of the former ' first cheater ' have garnered little notice			0
according to @entity8 , @entity2 told friends that @entity26 is ' having another of his middle - age crises			1
' and she does n't seem to mind			0
no more ' @entity31 ' : ' i 've told him that when we are back in the @entity6 he 'll have to behave , ' @entity2 told her friends last year , @entity8 writes in @entity16 during one of @entity31 's whirlwind trips across the world , he met with ' the playboy king of @entity40 ' @entity39 in @entity41 ' we accept each other as we are and chase our collective dream , ' @entity8 quotes her as saying to a group of confidantes			1
' all that s * * t of throwing things at him and yelling is in the distant past			1
' the specter of the former president being properly referred to as @entity1 's ' first gentleman ' has produced eye - rolls and chuckles in @entity57 , given his penchant for being seen with gorgeous starlets and famed @entity60 in exotic locations			1
' during one recent whirlwind trip around the world , ' @entity2 reportedly told her friends , @entity26 ' started off in @entity65 with @entity66 at an event for @entity68 , the gay and lesbian advocacy group			0
' ' then he went to @entity72 with @entity73 ; jetted off to @entity41 to spend a few days with @entity39 , the playboy @entity74 ; went next to @entity75 to meet @entity76 and his husband @entity77 , then was off to @entity78 for an @entity80 benefit with his new best friends @entity82 and @entity83			2
' it was all part of a conversation in may 2013 , two months after @entity2 left the @entity86 , at the @entity88 restaurant @entity89 near the @entity19 ' home in @entity91 , @entity92			0
' this guy is unstoppable , ' she reportedly told her friends			1
' i 've told him that when we are back in the @entity6 , ' she added , according to @entity8 , ' he 'll have to behave			2
we are at that point where we can joke about it			0
you have to love him			0
' the revelation came as the @entity103 published audio excerpts from a series of interviews the @entity19 did in the 1980s with a reporter who planned to write a profile for @entity109			0
' when a person gets to be a certain age it ’s hard to change a lot , ' said @entity31 , then hovering around 40 years of age			2
' but i think i have been able to change some of my bad habits , and to shore up my weaknesses a little better , set up a system which helps my strengths			0
' on the same trip , @entity31 , center , attended the @entity121 in @entity78 with musician @entity76 , center left actress @entity82 , right , is named in @entity16 as one of @entity31 's gal pals			1

' ' the thing with @entity133 is that he ca n’t be bothered and there is no hand on the tiller half the time , ' she is said to have barked in a boozy rant			1
‘ that ’s the story of the @entity133 presidency			2
no hand on the f * * * ing tiller			1
’ ' @entity133 has turned into a joke , ' she declares in @entity8 's account			1
' the @entity150 targeting the @entity151 , the @entity153 ’s seizure of @entity155 phone records and @entity157 ’s emails – all these scandals			0
@entity133 ’s allowed his hatred for his enemies to screw him the way @entity163 did			2
' the @entity19 have been under a renewed spotlight since the publication of @entity2 's memoir , ' @entity167 , ' and her ham - fisted media interviews in which she claimed she and @entity4 were not among @entity1 's richest elites			2
financial disclosures , however , put their worth in the eight - figure range			0
and they routinely pull in between $ 200,000 and $ 500,000 for public speeches .			0

the former *secretary* of state has made her peace with @entity31 's bed - *hopping* , according to @entity8 's latest tell - all book

' this guy is unstoppable , ' she said in @entity8 's account
she also laid into president @entity133 that *night* , calling him ' incompetent and feckless ' and saying there 's ' no hand on the f * * * ing tiller ' in his administration
