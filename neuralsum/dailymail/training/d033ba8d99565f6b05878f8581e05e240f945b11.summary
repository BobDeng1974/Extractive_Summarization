by @entity0 published : 08:26 est , 12 march 2014 updated : 10:12 est , 12 march 2014 the world 's leading space agency is looking for asteroid hunters to help save the planet - and you could help			2
@entity7 is offering up to $ 35,000 ( £ 21,000 ) over the next six months to anyone who is able develop computer code that can identify life - threatening asteroids			1
by mining talent from the general public , the space agency hopes to spot dangerous space rocks such as the one that saw off the dinosaurs 66 million years ago			1
@entity7 is offering up to $ 35,000 ( £ 21,000 ) over the next six months to anyone who is able develop computer code that can identify life - threatening asteroids the bounty is part of its @entity23 contest which plans to reduce the number of false positives found in images from ground - based telescopes			1
over the past two decades , @entity7 has been looking for dangerous near - @entity29 asteroids larger than 1km in size , and claims to have found 98 per cent of them			1
but existing asteroid detection systems can only track one per cent of the estimated objects that orbit the sun , according to asteroid mining firm @entity35 , who is partnering with @entity7 on the project			1
in a session at the @entity42 conference in @entity43 , @entity7 scientist @entity39 said : ‘ the likelihood of something hitting us in the future is pretty guaranteed , although we ’re not freaking out that there is an imminent threat			1
’ the bounty is part of its @entity23 contest which plans to reduce the number of false positives found in images from ground - based telescopes scientists have warned of a possible asteroid collision with the @entity29 this month			1
an asteroid around two - thirds of a mile wide ( 1.2km ) could hit the @entity29 on march 21 and has been classified as ' an event meriting careful monitoring " by astronomers			0
but they say the probability of the asteroid hitting @entity29 is just 1 in 909,000 and the risk of impact is likely to decrease as they collect more information			0
the newly - discovered asteroid , known as 2003 @entity70 , has a mass of around 2,600 million tons ( 2,600 billion kg )			0
its orbit calculations are currently based on just 51 observations during a seven - day period			1
dr @entity75 of @entity76 , @entity77 , one of the expert team advising the @entity79 @entity80 , based in @entity81 , said : ' the @entity80 will be observable from @entity29 for the next two months , and astronomers will continue to track it over this period			2
' ‘ if a 30 - metre asteroid were to hit in the wrong place at the wrong time , it could wipe out an entire city , ' currently there are only around 100 people who tracks asteroids each day to determine their shape and speed			2
@entity7 wants to increase that number , particularly over @entity94 and @entity95 where spottings are n’t being made			2
‘ ultimately our goal is to get an infrared telescope that ’s away from the @entity29 , ’ he professor @entity39			0
‘ we recognise we need to get away from the @entity29 so that our field of view opens up			0
’ ‘ the opportunity as the number of detections increases is for amateur astronomers – our citizen scientists – to help here			0
’ citizens science projects such as this are increasingly being used by researchers to help in large - scale projects			0
@entity112 , for example , is one of the leading online platforms for citizen scientists , working on a range of projects including classifying galaxies			0
last month , up one million volunteers signed up to the programme .			0

@entity121 , available for six months , is part of @entity23 contest
the contest hopes to reduce false positives when searching for asteroids
@entity7 would like *members* of the public to develop computer code that can better spot near - earth asteroids in images from ground - based telescopes
