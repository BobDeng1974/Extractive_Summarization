people diagnosed with @entity1 are twice as likely to die prematurely than people without the disorder , according to new research			1
those diagnosed as adults were more than four times as likely to die early compared with those without adhd at the same age - while children diagnosed before the age of six years had around double the risk of early death			1
@entity1 is a group of behavioural symptoms that include inattentiveness , hyperactivity and impulsiveness			0
@entity1 , commonly treated with @entity17 ( pictured ) is a group of behavioural symptoms that include inattentiveness , hyperactivity and impulsiveness it 's the @entity22 's most common behavioural disorder and an estimated two to five per cent of schoolchildren and young people are affected by it			0
the increased risk of early death was driven by deaths from unnatural causes , more than half of which were caused by accidents			1
the study , published in @entity32 , is the first to shed light on the role of @entity1 in premature death			2
dr @entity36 of @entity37 in @entity38 said : ' our findings emphasise the importance diagnosing adhd early , especially in girls and women , and treating any co-existing antisocial and substance use disorders			1
' it is however important to emphasise that although the relative risk of premature death is increased in @entity1 , the absolute risk is low			1
' the large nationwide study followed nearly two million people from the @entity38 national registers , including more than 32,000 people with @entity1 , from their first birthday to 2013 , for a maximum of 32 years			1
the causes of premature death were then assessed to compare individuals with and without adhd and found 107 with @entity1 died			0
previous research showed individuals with @entity1 are more likely to have a range of co-existing disorders including oppositional defiant disorder , conduct disorder , and substance use disorders			2
commenting on the study , professor of psychiatry dr @entity64 at @entity66 said : ' for too long , the validity of @entity1 as a medical disorder has been challenged			0
' policy makers should take heed of these data and allocate a fair share of health care and research resources to people with @entity1			0
' for clinicians , early identification and treatment should become the rule rather than the exception			0
' although talk of premature death will worry parents and patients , they can seek solace in the knowledge that the absolute risk for premature death is low and that this and other risks can be greatly reduced with evidenced - based treatments for the disorder			0
' the findings also reveal that girls and women with @entity1 have a higher relative risk of premature death compared with boys and men with @entity1 .			2

new research claims those with @entity1 are twice as likely to die prematurely
the increased risk is driven by unnatural causes , such as car *crashes*
@entity38 researchers revealed the findings following a 32 - year study
they said findings emphasised the importance of early @entity1 diagnosis
