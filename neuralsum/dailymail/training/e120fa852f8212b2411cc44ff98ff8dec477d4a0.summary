researchers claim an age bias in the @entity2 is denying the elderly of life - saving cancer treatment			1
stock picture used the elderly are being denied life - saving cancer surgery due to an age bias in the @entity2 , researchers warn			1
they found that patients ’ chances of undergoing vital operations decline sharply with age for all of the most common types of tumour			1
for prostate cancer , almost nobody has surgery once they reach 75 whereas it is offered to more than a quarter of men under 55			1
and women with ovarian cancer over the age of 75 are half as likely to have surgery as those under 55 , according to a major study by @entity27			1
@entity28 has among the worst cancer survival rates in @entity30 and the gap is even wider for the elderly who are more likely to die from the disease than those in @entity35 , @entity36 and @entity37			1
one explanation is that they are being written off before the first consultation by doctors who only look at their date of birth			0
@entity44 , @entity27 ’s head of statistics , said : ‘ these figures provide further detail about the age bias that older cancer patients face			2
if older patients are not being offered a surgical option , that is wrong			0
‘ we do have lower treatment rates than other countries and this is more pronounced in older people			2
we have lower survival rates in older people , that could be explained by lower access to treatment			1
’ the research – overseen by the @entity62 , the government agency which analyses data – looked at 367,000 patients who underwent surgery in @entity66 between 2006 and 2010			0
this covered 21 types of cancer and for each one , academics worked out the percentage of patients having surgery in five age groups			1
they found that while 29 per cent of men with prostate cancer aged 15 to 54 had surgery , it fell to 0.1 per cent for those aged 75 to 84 – and nobody had it over 85			1
this means that just 48 potentially life - saving operations to remove prostate cancer are carried out in men over 75 in @entity66 every year			1
for women with ovarian cancer , just 37 per cent aged 75 to 84 had operations to remove tumours compared to 89 per cent in the 15 to 54 age group			1
@entity88 , head of policy at the charity @entity90 , said : ‘ this is yet more upsetting evidence that older cancer patients in @entity66 are getting a raw deal , despite the fact that half of people diagnosed with cancer are in this age bracket			2
’ the table above shows the likelihood of cancer surgery for each age group as a percentage surgery is considered the most effective treatment for cancer and is responsible for half of the cases where the illness is cured			1
not all elderly patients will be suitable for treatment and those with other health problems such as dementia or heart disease may just be too frail			0
others may not want to undergo a potentially risky procedure particularly if they would also need gruelling chemotherapy			0
in october 2012 new laws came into force banning all @entity2 staff from denying any treatment to the elderly based on their age alone			2
although this research took place two years before this came into force , there is ample evidence the age discrimination is still widespread			0
@entity129 , national clinical director for cancer at @entity66 , said : ‘ a person ’s age should not be a barrier to getting the most effective treatments			2
it ’s clear that more needs to be done to ensure older patients have equal access to treatment			0
’ hundreds of thousands of cancer patients are going through the distressing ordeal of hospital treatment on their own , figures show			0
the charity @entity90 estimates that 89 per cent of those with the illness went to at least one appointment alone – the equivalent of 270,000 sufferers in the @entity28 a year			2
nearly a third said it was because they did n’t want to be a burden or that a relative or close friend was n’t available			0
one in 20 patients said they had no choice as there was n’t anyone to ask			0
many patients say they feel incredibly lonely having to sit around for hours waiting for chemotherapy , radiotherapy or an appointment where they might be given bad news			0
@entity166 , head of health and social care for @entity90 which surveyed 2,000 cancer patients , said : ‘ it is deeply saddening that cancer patients are facing one of the most frightening moments of their lives without having anyone with them to offer support			0

researches claim elderly have lower chance of undergoing cancer surgery
prostate cancer surgery is offered to more than a quarter of men under 55
but almost no - one has surgery for it once they reach age of 75
@entity28 has the worst cancer survival rates in @entity30
