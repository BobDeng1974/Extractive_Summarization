host commentator thanks for tuning into our coverage today ! @entity3 have the win they wanted			1
it was n't pretty but @entity6 really saw them through and they have another three points			2
@entity10 meanwhile remain rooted to the bottom of the table and were totally outplayed			1
@entity13 sees yellow for pulling back @entity15			2
@entity16 normally buries them but he hits it straight at @entity19			0
@entity20 gets past @entity21 and he pulls it back for @entity16 on the penalty spot who side - foots it straight at the keeper			1
@entity27 puts the ball past @entity15 and the defender decides to trip him up			1
clever at this stage of the game			0
@entity33 is capable of scoring the spectacular and he smashes one from 25 yards out which dips just before @entity35			0
the goalkeeper is able to collect it though			0
@entity27 is frustrating but he can do brilliant things from time to time			0
the midfielder skips between the @entity3 midfield and runs at the defence before unleashing a shot which swerves wide of the right - hand post			2
@entity44 , who has possibly been @entity3 's best player today , rises highest from a corner to nod the ball straight into @entity19 's hands			1
the only side who look like scoring here are @entity3 ... the midfielder curls the ball around the wall but @entity35 is equal to it and palms it away			1
@entity10 need a goal - and soon ! @entity3 are in total cruise control and the spark that was in @entity10 at the start of the second half is completely gone			1
@entity44 has been comfortable at the back for @entity3 and both @entity62 and @entity63 need to challenge him more			1
@entity64 has it in the net but the referee disallows it			0
@entity19 had put the ball down to take a free - kick and he passed it straight to @entity64 but the striker was not 10 yards away			1
@entity6 now have five goals in just five starts for @entity3 and that is a real blow to @entity10			1
@entity44 tries to shoot from a tight angle and ends up looping the ball over the defence and to the back post where @entity6 just nods it home from a yard			1
@entity82 decides he is going to have a go from distance and he tries to launch one from the middle of pitch			0
unfortunately his volley is blocked only yards in front of him and @entity10 still do not have the breakthrough			2
@entity62 has given @entity10 a lot more shape			0
they are getting into the game now and @entity95 is becoming more and more involved			0
@entity3 on the other hand can not get their foot on the ball for long at the moment			2
@entity62 causes problems and he is breaking past @entity44 so the @entity3 man brings him down and is booked			1
that is far better from @entity10			0
straight away the substitute @entity62 gets involved and breaks down the left			0
he centres the ball for @entity63 who gets a foot on the ball but it goes past the post			2
it certainly has n't been a classic , but @entity3 look extremely comfortable			0
since taking the lead after five minutes they have n't really felt the need to put their foot on the has			0
@entity10 simply have n't put their foot on anything yet			0
they have been very poor and you would expect changes soon			0
@entity118 is running his hart out up top but there is simply no support			0
@entity123 has been tidy in midfield but is n't exactly setting the world alight and @entity95 is being prevented from influencing the match			2
@entity64 is down with a slight knee injury			0
they really have not got going at all here @entity10 and they keep just lumping it forward			0
apart from @entity63 's chance , their only real positive is that they have only conceded the one ... @entity134 has been completely anonynmous			1
@entity64 makes a wonderful run in behind the @entity10 defence and he wants the ball played to him from @entity138			1
the ball is delayed slightly though and the @entity140 is caught offside			0
warning signs for @entity10 though			0
they just keep shooting themselves in the foot			0
@entity64 makes himself a nuisance and he makes sure to get his body between the ball and @entity123 , who alongside @entity147 takes three attempts to get rid of what should have been a fairly routine defensive clearance			1
everything that @entity3 have done well has come through @entity20			2
he is enjoying his role behind the front players and is spreading the play beautifully with some long - range passes			0
@entity6 's headed flies just wide meanwhile when he should score			2
@entity118 does brilliantly to slot the ball through @entity160 's legs and he finds himself through on goal to the left - hand side			1
instead of squaring to @entity95 , he takes the shot on himself but can only lash it straight at @entity35			2
@entity164 seems to be carrying a knock now for @entity3			2
@entity166 , who scored the goal to get @entity3 promoted , is applauded as he comes on to warm up for @entity10			1
i 'm afraid apart from @entity3 kicking the ball out for a goal kick when they had a good attacking opportunity , that 's about all there is to report ... @entity10 are getting frustrated in attack because there simply is n't enough cohesion and communication between the attacking players			1
there is a huge gap and @entity63 is so isolated			0
@entity6 is breaking into space because @entity10 are stretched so @entity123 takes one for the team and takes him out			1
@entity184 of all @entity82 finds himself offside for @entity10 then @entity20 for @entity3			1
a lot of sloppy play from both sides , but particularly the visitors			0
@entity20 is being positive with everything he does			0
he sends @entity6 down the left whose cross deflects behind @entity64 and he smashes it just wide			2
@entity10 had a good three minutes and have been awful since ... @entity192 needs to find something from his players			2
@entity3 look dangerous every time they go forward , however , particularly through @entity20			1
@entity19 is adamant there is a hand ball here but @entity3 are ahead			1
@entity20 whips in the corner and @entity10 simply do not defend it			2
@entity6 just sticks out a leg and it may even have been an @entity21 own goal			1
@entity10 have the first meaningful attack and @entity118 is fouled in the centre of the park			0
we 're almost ready for the fourth @entity207 game of the day			0
five minutes until kick - off after the delay at @entity210			0
@entity10 have n't won at @entity211 for 21 years ! the breezed past the hosts 4 - 0 that day with two goals from @entity214 sandwiched by @entity215 and @entity217 strikes			1
out they come , led by @entity20			0
