a @entity2 @entity1 preacher has posted to @entity3 in support of the @entity5 saying scholars who support an @entity5 ' are on the front lines , in the battlefields , backing their words with actions '			1
@entity11 , who has rejected claims that he leads an extremist youth group tied to terrorist group @entity14 , posted that they were ' suffering in the prisons ' and ' known for speaking the truth , no matter what it costs them '			1
the 25 - year - old also went on to mock ' the ones who spew the nonsense of " patriotism " , " @entity28 " , " deradicalization " , and other terms for which @entity26 has sent down no authority			0
this comes just days after @entity47 photojournalist @entity46 was executed by @entity14 in @entity48 , after being abducted by the group in 2012			2
in june , foreign minister @entity50 said the federal government was investigating mr @entity11 's online posts			2
' any promotion or support for terrorism is against the law in our country , ' she told the @entity59			0
' and [ @entity14 ] is a proscribed terrorist organisation			0
' mr @entity11 says he is a university student and claims to have memorised the @entity60 at age six			1
the 25 - year - old , who was deported from @entity33 last year for protesting his older brother @entity34 's imprisonment on terrorism - related offences , has previously been accused of being a radical preacher for allegedly praising militants responsible for beheadings and mass killings in @entity69 in june			0
mr @entity11 and his brother @entity34 moved to @entity33 19 years ago for their father 's work , @entity70 reported			2
mr @entity11 ( pictured left ) says the accusations are all ' a big misunderstanding ' their mother , who lives in the @entity2 suburb of @entity80 and is divorced from their father , said her sons were @entity84 , @entity38 citizens but identified primarily as @entity28			1
@entity87 terrorism expert @entity85 , who is based in @entity2 , said mr @entity11 used to be the leader of @entity1 group @entity89 but she was not sure if it was still functional			1
' i think now they 're just a bit rag tag , a group of guys that stick together and he 's trying to put his thoughts out there now , ' dr @entity85 told @entity99			0
dr @entity85 said he was intentionally trying to be provocative			0
' he 's been saying he 's very much against democracy - they do n't believe in democracy which means they do n't believe in voting or @entity38 rule of law which is pretty typical of the jihadi ideology , ' she said			2
' the stuff he 's put up about supporting the @entity5 , underlying that is this belief system that only those who go and fight – the mujahedeen – are true @entity28 or are the best muslims and that is very much what the @entity5 puts out there			1
' that 's very extreme to say			0
' dr @entity85 said mr @entity11 was attention seeking but it was important to expose mr @entity11 's views in order to challenge them			2
' if the young people he 's speaking to via social media , if that 's the only message they 're getting , they do n't have any other opportunity to get another message they only get that one side , ' she said			0
' often their families who might be expressing concern do n't know that this is how they started to believe these extreme ideas in the first place			0
' but if it 's out there in the broad media then there 's more opportunity for those young people to hear another viewpoint			0
' videos of mr @entity11 's speeches have been posted to the @entity142 channel @entity141 over the past few months			1
' our sisters being raped by these filthy @entity145 and @entity146 , ' he said in one video posted in june			2
' our sisters are in the streets , their bodies are filling the streets , bombs dropping on houses killing women and children			0
' in a talk titled @entity141 and @entity157 , posted on august 6 , mr @entity11 said : ' no one has a problem with you worshipping @entity26 [ the exulted ]			1
' but when you start speaking against or start speaking the truth , and you start calling people to the way of @entity26 [ the exulted ] and proving to them the falsehood of their false deities , and the corruption of their evil systems , this is when people start getting on edge and this is when people see their desires being attacked			0
' last week , mr @entity11 said that reports he and a dozen @entity2 youths , from various ethnic backgrounds , were associated with the terrorist group @entity14 were all part of ' a big misunderstanding ' - despite posing in a video with @entity14 flags			1
' i do n't have a group of youth nor @entity38 reverts , there is some big misunderstanding going on - i do n't know why , ' he told @entity99			1
mr @entity11 ( left ) said he did not know of any ' @entity38 reverts ' while a @entity2 man , who 's believed to be named @entity191 ( right ) , claims @entity141 saved him from a drug addiction @entity191 ( centre ) , @entity11 ( fourth from right ) are pictured with others in front of @entity14 flags mr @entity11 would n't comment any further but said he will be releasing a video that will be ' a response and clarification to the current situation '			1
although he denied knowing any @entity38 reverts , a recruitment video shows a ginger - bearded former @entity87 student who converted to @entity141 , @entity200 reported			1
a photo also shows mr @entity11 and the former hip - hop rapper posing together with @entity14 flags			1
when asked about whether he knew the man , @entity11 neither confirmed nor denied knowing him			2
the man , allegedly named @entity191 but calls himself ' @entity208 ' - a play on ' terrorist ' , claims @entity141 saved him from a drug addiction in @entity2 in 2006			1
in the video , he expresses his invincibility through @entity141 and encourages others to join him			1
' you gon na kill , you wo n't kill me because @entity26 says i 'm alive , i 'm receiving sustenance , ' he said in the video			0
' so what can you do to me ? absolutely nothing			0
' come to @entity141 , feel this feeling ... come to @entity141 and you will not regret it			2
' he ends his passionate speech with : ' plenty of cold ones in paradise			0
