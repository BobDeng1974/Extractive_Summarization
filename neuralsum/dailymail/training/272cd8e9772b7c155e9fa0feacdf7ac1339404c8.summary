by @entity0 published : 11:05 est , 23 november 2012 updated : 11:35 est , 23 november 2012 a row has broken out between two of @entity4 ’s most historic cathedral cities after one accused the other of trying to ' steal ' its @entity7 shoppers			2
traders in @entity9 , @entity10 , were left seething when a billboard went up in the city centre advertising a festive market in @entity14 , @entity15 , 30 miles away			1
they feared the poster - which described @entity14 as ' @entity18 ’s @entity17 ' - would draw away valuable business			2
riled : traders in @entity9 were left fuming when this poster for a @entity7 market in neighbouring town @entity14 appeared on their doorstep payback : @entity9 traders retaliated by erecting a poster for their own festive market by @entity14 's railway station now they have hit back with their own market and poster - and placed it in view of thousands of commuters near @entity14 ’s railway station			1
@entity9 hopes to attract some of the 400,000 people that spend around £ 1.5 million at the @entity36 - style market in @entity14 each year			1
the event - in the former capital of @entity18 - has been running in the picturesque grounds of @entity40 for six years			0
an open air ice rink , live music , and wooden chalets selling a range of food and handmade gifts are said to boost sales in nearby shops by 25 per cent			0
lucrative : the @entity7 market at @entity14 pulls in 400,000 people a year and is said to be worth at least £ 1.5million to the local economy @entity52 , chairman of @entity53 , hopes @entity9 ’s new @entity7 market will help claw back some customers			1
he said : ' a lot of traders in @entity9 were angry when @entity14 tried to steal our customers by placing an advert in our city centre			1
' they first did it last year and have done so again this year			0
in the current economic climate every customer is crucial and we can not afford to lose them to other cities			0
' we have wanted a @entity7 market in @entity9 for many years and @entity14 ’s poster spurred us on to launch one this year			1
' as part of our marketing we have placed a billboard poster in @entity14 and are now taking them on - on their own turf			1
' rivalry : salisbury traders say @entity14 christmas market is stealing their business @entity80 , from @entity81 , welcomed the competition			2
she said : ' the advert in @entity9 formed part of our wider marketing campaign and was not targeted specifically at them			0
' we just want people to be aware of our event and are not trying to ‘ steal ’ customers			0
' however , our poster does seem to have spurred them on and it is nice to have a bit of friendly competition between two great historic cities			0
' she added : ' we are not overly concerned by their efforts because we are confident we still offer the best market and @entity7 entertainment in @entity18			0
