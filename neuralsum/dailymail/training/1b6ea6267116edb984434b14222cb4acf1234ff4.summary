by @entity1 - @entity0 follow @ @ riathalsam it started with a twinge for one and ended with a whinge for the other , but two @entity7 players scored impressive victories on the opening day of the @entity10 at @entity11			2
for @entity13 , there was a fine straight - sets win over @entity15 , followed by a rather testy complaint in his press conference about questions on the subject of female coaches			1
then there was @entity22 , @entity24 ’s @entity23 , who later in the afternoon pulled off a significant upset in the first round by knocking out @entity27 , a top - 10 player three years ago			1
more impressively , @entity22 ' win came against the backdrop of pain in his left knee that has lingered for nine months and will require a lay - off from the game after @entity34			1
perfect start : @entity24 's @entity22 celebrates victory over @entity27 in the first round of the @entity10 at @entity11 on form : @entity22 defeated the world no 51 in three sets to reach the second round early exit : @entity27 plays a backhand during his disappointing defeat to @entity22 on day one at @entity11 often maligned and sanctioned in the past for his attitude , the 24 - year - old delivered an exhibition of his undoubted talents with a 6 - 3 , 6 - 7 , 7 - 6 win over @entity52 ’s world no 51			1
the world no 139 won the first set 6 - 3 and led in the second - set tiebreak before two double faults — accompanied by a racket toss — let the @entity52 back in			1
@entity27 , 33 , pressed home his advantage , breaking early in the third set			1
but @entity22 first levelled and then excelled as the match went into another tiebreak			2
he forced an early mini-break with a delightful backhand pass down the line and led 5 - 2 when @entity27 shanked a forehand into the stands			1
@entity22 wrapped up the win with an ace down the middle to set up a second - round clash against @entity72 @entity71 , the seventh seed , this morning			1
on the run : @entity22 stretches to make a forehand return on a sunny afternoon in west @entity76 solid start : @entity13 plays a backhand on his way to a straight - sets win over @entity15 at @entity81 's ‘ it was a good win , ’ said @entity22			1
‘ i played well , i took my chances when i needed them and fought back from a break down in the third			2
it was a good day			0
’ having previously received punishments — including the cutting of his funding in 2008 — from the @entity90 over his behaviour , @entity22 has apparently turned a corner with a string of impressive results , such as a run to the last 32 at the @entity96			2
he added : ‘ obviously @entity34 is where you want to win the matches because there are more points there			0
‘ second , third , fourth round of @entity34 would be pretty good			0
winning some matches in @entity34 will be a goal			0
’ @entity106 : @entity13 was in impressive form as he overcame a 64 - place ranking deficit to beat @entity109 @entity13 , meanwhile , had little trouble in staging a decent upset against @entity112 ’s @entity109 , overcoming a 64 - place ranking deficit to beat the world no 91 7 - 5 , 6 - 4			1
@entity13 went on a stunning run to the semi-finals here in 2011			2
‘ that run was obviously like a one ‑ off , ’ said the world no 155			0
‘ i played unbelievable the whole week			0
you ca n’t do that every week			0
but i think i ’m playing a lot better , a lot more consistent			0
with the opportunities in the next few weeks , hopefully i ’ll keep moving forward			0
’ @entity122 broke early against @entity124 ’s @entity123 , but failed to make it a @entity7 hat - trick as he lost 7 - 5 , 6 - 2 .			0
