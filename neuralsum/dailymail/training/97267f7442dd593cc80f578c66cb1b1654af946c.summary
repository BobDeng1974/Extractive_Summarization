@entity0 is to introduce a ' graduate tax ' on the earnings of those who go to university			1
@entity6 business secretary @entity5 said yesterday the system would be ' fairer ' than tuition fees and would be introduced ' in the medium term ' if @entity0 returns to power			1
the @entity11 proposed an extra tax of between 0.3 per cent and 2.5 per cent of their income above £ 15,000 , for a period of 20 years , with the highest earners paying higher rates			2
@entity0 is struggling to work out how to pay for a pledge it has already made to slash university tuition fees from the current maximum of £ 9,000 a year to £ 6,000			1
the £ 6,000 cap is expected to be included in @entity0 's general election manifesto , but it is not clear how the party intends to meet such an expensive commitment			1
previously , @entity0 has suggested that it might pay for the cut with a corporation tax increase on banks or with higher rates of interest for better - off students			1
the party may also be forced to restrict the cut in fees to certain types of courses such as technical degrees , leaving other students to keep on paying the current cost			1
mr @entity5 , who is responsible for higher education policy , said introducing a full - scale graduate tax ' as soon as possible is my priority '			0
' in the medium term , a graduate tax is the way to go			0
it 's fairer , it 's more progressive and it 's the way you clear up the unsustainable financial mess that has been created by the current government under their system , ' the shadow business secretary said			1
' they are going to have to make huge write - offs on the student loans that they have been giving to people to pay these trebled tuition fees and a graduate tax ultimately getting to that place as fast as possible is key			1
' mr @entity5 insisted it was ' unacceptable ' that students were being saddled with ' a huge heap of debt '			1
' the reason it has taken us some time to finalise our policy is because the ground has moved from us on this issue , ' he said			0
' the estimate on what students would be able to repay keeps falling in terms of what they expect to get back			2
north of the border : @entity103 ( pictured ) has been rocked by a series of polls suggesting @entity0 could lose almost all of its 40 seats to the @entity108 in @entity109 ' we will be announcing the policy on this before the election campaign			1
we are not going to erect a road - block to people 's aspirations , as this government has			0
' @entity0 first introduced tuition fees in september 1998 , with students expected to pay up to £ 1,000 a year			1
the fees were then increased to £ 3,000 a year during @entity0 's second term in january 2004			1
according to the @entity123 , students now graduate with an average of £ 44,035 of debt			1
repayments only begin when their earnings rise above £ 21,000 a @entity129 secretary @entity128 said the damage suffered by his party after its u-turn on tuition fees was a ' price worth paying ' , as the latest figures showed a record number of teenagers from disadvantaged backgrounds are applying to university			1
the @entity35 minister hailed a further narrowing of the gap between the number of rich and poor students wanting to go on to higher education			2
mr @entity128 said the controversial move to treble tuition fees to a maximum of £ 9,000 has not deterred poorer students from applying			1
he added : ' the opposite has occurred ; numbers have grown , in particular those from disadvantaged backgrounds			0
' mr @entity128 described the new system as ' better , affordable and fair '			0
he said : ' we have paid a price for this policy more than any other party			0
but the success of these reforms , with more students from disadvantaged backgrounds applying to university than ever before , shows it was a price worth paying			0
' regardless of family circumstances , all students can now obtain university level education as long as they meet academic requirements			0
this is a good legacy			0
' the figures , from university admissions service @entity170 , show 21 per cent of 18 - year - olds from disadvantaged backgrounds in @entity174 applied this year			0
overall , the richest 18 - year - olds in the @entity176 are 2.4 times more likely to want to go to university than the poorest			0
but in 2006 , when @entity0 was in power , the wealthiest were 3.7 times more likely to want to apply			2
@entity180 will play a major role in @entity0 's general election campaign in a bid to prevent wipeout in @entity109 , party sources said			2
@entity103 has been rocked by a series of polls suggesting @entity0 could lose almost all of its 40 seats to the @entity108			2
mr @entity180 , who is stepping down as an mp , is widely credited with reinvigorating the @entity190 campaign ahead of last year 's @entity109 independence referendum			0
a @entity0 source said of the former prime minister : ' @entity180 is our ace card			2
' he has often been the butt of a few jokes , so @entity103 probably enjoyed being the comedian himself for once			0
but whether his audience of political journalists did this week was n't clear			0
here are some of the jokes he delivered in his speech on thursday at the event inspired by the @entity204 – famous for its light - hearted speech by the president .			0
