by @entity0 it appears @entity2 has struck a deal to auction off the engagement ring that he gave to @entity5 during their ill - fated romance , @entity1 has learned			1
the @entity9 star is said to be selling the @entity11 ring that he gave to @entity5 at an upcoming @entity13 's auction in @entity14			1
the ring is expected to sell for between $ 300,000 and $ 500,000 - which is less than a quarter of the price that the ring was said to have cost originally			1
bling : @entity5 's former 20 - carat sparkler was used by @entity2 to propose to @entity5 back in may 2011 return : @entity5 returned her former engagement ring to @entity2 following their divorce same cut : the seller of the ring is known only as ' a gentleman ' but the description exactly matches the ring @entity2 gave @entity5 ( pictured left and right ) before their 72 - day marriage an ' impressive ' ring made by @entity11 , a designer and @entity5 family friend , is featured as part of the upcoming october 15 auction titled ' @entity37 '			1
@entity2 has not publicly stated that he is selling his ex 's ring , and the owner of the item is only listed as the ' property of a gentleman ' , but the dimensions of the sparkler are the exact same as that of the ring that once belonged to @entity5			2
it is made up of a 16.21 - carat rectangular cut diamond which is then flanked by a 1.80 - carat diamond on either side			0
all told , that adds up to just under 20 - carats which is very close to the descriptions of @entity5 's ring , as it was said to be just over 20 - carats			2
showing off : @entity5 proudly displayed the ring that @entity2 paid for			0
it ended up going to him in the divorce because he argued that their marriage was a sham and she did not deserve to keep the ring as a result sold : earlier this month , @entity5 's bling was finally sold at auction for a cool $ 749,000 pictures of the ring show that the ring listed at @entity13 and the bauble that the reality star flaunted following their may 18 , 2011 engagement and the entirety of their 72 - day marriage are a perfect match			1
though the discrepancies in the carat size are slight , the gap between what @entity2 was said to have paid for the ring and its current estimate is much wider			0
when @entity2 popped the question after a whirlwind six - month romance , the ring was said to cost $ 2million			1
a family friend of the @entity88 said that @entity2 reportedly ' got a great deal ' by working with jeweller @entity11 , who had designed for the @entity5 clan for years			0
happier times : the two have since moved past their 72 - day marriage , and their annulment proceedings actually lasted longer than their wedded union because of the estimate of the @entity13 's jewellery experts , it appears that he paid far less for the ring than reported at the time			2
the bad publicity following the @entity2 - @entity5 divorce that lasted longer than their marriage may have had an effect on the sale			0
@entity13 's press representative @entity107 told @entity1 that their team of experts ' estimate on what they deem it worth at this time ( of the auction ) '			2
the auction house also specified that a portion of the ring â€™s sale will be donated to charity by the owner , though the name of the charity has not been announced nor has the percentage of the sale price			0
new man : @entity5 is now dating @entity126 , and the pair 's daughter @entity129 was born on june 15			0

a 16 carat ring matching the description of @entity5 's engagement ring is being *anonymously* auctioned by @entity13
@entity2 won the ring in the couple 's june 2012 divorce
reports at the time of the engagement said it cost $ 2million , but @entity13 's estimates the ring 's value is only $ 300,000 to $ 500,000
