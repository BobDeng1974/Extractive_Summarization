@entity0 , the @entity1 's first openly gay player , has been named one of @entity4 's @entity3 as it emerges he could be recruited into the @entity6 by @entity8 front man @entity7			1
@entity0 , 24 , made history this year when he was drafted into the @entity1 's @entity10 after publicly revealing he is gay			1
but he has yet to play a regular season game as he was dropped by the @entity10 in august , snapped up by the @entity12 days later , only to be dropped again in october , having never made it out of the practice squad			1
@entity15 : this is one of @entity4 's revered collectible covers naming @entity0 as a man of the year different league ? @entity0 ( left ) is set to be offered a contract with the new @entity6 team @entity21 by owner , @entity8 front man @entity7 ( right ) after being dropped twice this season the move to @entity7 's newly - formed @entity21 would be widely recognized as a step down for the defensive end , who many analysts expected to be offered a contract in the @entity28			1
@entity0 signed his historical contracts as the first ' out ' player with the @entity10 in may , and then another with the @entity12 in september , despite a disappointing performance in the @entity32			1
his first signing prompted a letter from @entity35 congratulating the @entity1 on ' taking an important step forward today in our @entity38 's journey ' by drafting a gay player			0
however , his deal was terminated at the end of the preseason			0
@entity0 then joined the @entity12 on september 3 , and practiced for seven weeks before being dropped			1
he was never placed on the 53 - man active roster			1
the latest potential lifeline for @entity0 , who has yet to play a regular season game , comes as @entity8 's @entity7 builds the franchise 's first ever squad for their debut season in 2015			1
deemed to be too small to play defensive end in the @entity1 , the smaller scale of @entity6 could play to @entity0 's strengths			2
the singer told the @entity56 he plans to make the offer in the coming days			0
it is unclear whether @entity0 plans to accept the offer			2
@entity7 's venture was approved by the league on june 17 this year , and had his chosen name , the @entity21 , approved in august			2
the squad will play at the @entity64 on the @entity65 , @entity66 , campus			2
@entity7 follows @entity68 , @entity69 , and @entity71 members @entity70 and @entity72 into the indoor league			2
dropped : @entity0 thanked @entity12 owner @entity74 for his support when he was dropped last month @entity15 : @entity0 has been praised for being open about his sexuality in @entity4 's @entity78 list @entity0 was today revealed as one of @entity4 's @entity3 and cover stars			1
he came out to his @entity82 teammates before his senior season in august 2013 , when he had 11 1/2 sacks			0
he told his father and the rest of the world three months before the may draft			0
when he was dropped by the @entity12 , @entity0 thanked the family of owner @entity74 on @entity91 , along with ' friends , family , teammates , and fans for their support			1
' ' while this is disappointing , i will take the lessons i learned here in @entity101 and continue to fight for an opportunity to prove that i can play every sunday , ' @entity0 wrote			0
lifeline : @entity0 , who came out before this season 's draft , has yet to play a regular season game this year the signing of @entity108 brought an overflow crowd to coach @entity111 's daily news conference , and he was surrounded by about two dozen reporters in the only interview he conducted on the same day			2
but he mostly blended in after that , making occasional appearances in the locker room when it was open to the media and earning praise from @entity111 and defensive coordinator and defensive line coach @entity121 the few times they were asked about him			0
' comes to work every day and practices hard , ' @entity111 said			0
' one of 10 practice roster guys that we have , so he 's working on his skills , trying to develop , but also doing a lot of other things			0
playing offense , defense , playing the kicking game			0
that 's what a lot of those guys do			0

@entity0 made history when he was drafted this year after coming out
he was dropped by the @entity10 before the season , practiced with the @entity12 but never made it onto the 53 - man active roster
@entity8 's @entity7 wants him in newly - formed @entity66 *outlaws*
