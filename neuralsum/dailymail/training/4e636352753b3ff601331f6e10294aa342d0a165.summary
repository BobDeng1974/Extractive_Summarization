do n't play with your food - that 's what we 're always told when we 're younger - but this huge tiger must have missed that message			1
the consequences , though , are adorable - these stunning images show the carnivorous beast frolicking about with a tiny fawn - who ca n't quite believe its luck			0
the baby deer might have been saved by maternal instinct - as the tiger was pregnant , and showed absolutely no interest in turning it into a tasty meal			1
they were taken by amateur photographer @entity32 , 46 , from @entity51 , who is a call centre worker by trade , but was lucky enough to stumble across this rare event while on safari			1
' it was early morning when i was roaming with a friend in the jungle scouting for tigers			0
at first , i thought she was playing alone but then i spotted the tiny fawn by her side , ' he said			0
come back ! the baby deer trots through the long grass away from the tiger , which lies down for a rest and to bask in the sun nap time : the giant tiger takes a minute to lie down in the road and take a quick kip after a busy half hour playing with the fawn on the prowl : after nudging its fawn friend to run off to freedom , the pregnant tiger wanders back into the grasses ' it was the most astonishing thing to see			1
i felt my heart beating fast as i was certain it was the end for the fawn			0
but the tiger sat calmly and played with the baby			1
' even though the tiger was in no mood to eat , the fawn was still visibly frightened			2
mr @entity32 said it even made an attempt to run but the tiger caught it , carried it gently in its mouth and took it back to the spot they were sitting			2
' the two were together for half an hour playing , running and jumping			2
then the tiger gently carried the fawn by its neck - as it would carry its own cub - and eventually started nudging it to run away , ' he added			0
i 'm sure the fawn could n't believe he was still alive as he ran off ! but the fascinating episode restored my belief - wild animals only kill when they 're hungry			0

the tiger and fawn played together for around half an hour before the carnivore let the baby deer go
@entity115 had no interest in eating what would normally be its prey , and only wanted to play
