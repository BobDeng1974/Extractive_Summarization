by @entity1 reporter published : 07:48 est , 7 august 2012 updated : 04:02 est , 8 august 2012 head injuries : @entity3 died a week after being found unconscious just 20 yards from his home the family and friends of a gifted surgeon killed outside his home reacted furiously yesterday when a teenager charged over his death escaped prosecution			1
@entity3 , 68 , was found sprawled on the ground next to his car and died in hospital six days later from head injuries			1
a 17 - year - old boy was arrested , questioned by detectives and charged with manslaughter			1
but yesterday the @entity18 dropped the case , saying a pathologist ’s report supported the boy ’s claim that he hit the cancer specialist in self defence			2
without any witnesses , lawyers said there was little prospect of a conviction			2
mr @entity3 ’s sister , @entity31 , 53 , said : ‘ to say that dropping the prosecution is a step in the wrong direction is an understatement			1
‘ it ’s hard to describe how i feel			0
obviously as a family we are disappointed no one will face trial but that hardly conveys the feelings we have about everything that has happened			0
’ a neighbour said : ‘ it ’s terribly upsetting			0
i ca n’t begin to imagine how difficult it must be for the family			0
it ’s just typical of our justice system			0
it ’s an absolute disgrace			0
’ another resident added : ‘ this teenager claimed self - defence and with no evidence or witnesses it seems there ’s nothing the law can do			1
‘ it ’s a terrible shame and awful for @entity3 ’s family that they will not see justice done			1
’ the incident took place in march in the prosperous @entity67 village of @entity68			1
afterwards three teenagers were seen riding away from mr @entity3 ’s £ 750,000 thatched house on bmx bikes			1
three suspects were arrested and questioned before one – the 17 year old – was charged with manslaughter			2
a respected oncologist , mr @entity3 began his medical career in 1968 and was awarded a fellowship of the @entity78 in 1973			2
he was semi-retired but had been working as a locum at @entity80 in @entity81 up until his tragic death			0
well to do : mr @entity3 's home in @entity68 , @entity84 , @entity67 , where he lived alone			1
the devout @entity85 , who had never married , had lived in @entity68 for more than 30 years , nursing his mother @entity87 , herself a retired doctor , until she died in 2003			0
@entity89 , who attended church with mr @entity3 , described him as ‘ the type of man who would stand up for himself ’			2
and residents living in the village have complained that teenagers from a nearby housing estate cause frequent problems			0
@entity98 , senior prosecutor at the @entity18 , said : ‘ after very careful consideration of all the evidence in this case , including new evidence which has recently been presented , i have decided not to continue the case against a 17 - year - old youth in connection with the death of @entity3			1
‘ the youth was originally charged with manslaughter on the basis that there was a reasonable suspicion he had committed the offence and there were grounds for believing that the continuing investigation would provide further evidence to support the prosecution			2
mr @entity3 , a devout @entity85 , had lived in the quiet village of @entity68 for more than 30 years and was well - liked by his neighbours ‘ since then , new evidence has been presented , including the final pathologist ’s report which indicates that the injuries to the victim were consistent with the victim suffering one blow to the face			1
‘ the pathologist ’s report provides supporting evidence for the defendant ’s version of events : that he was acting in self defence			1
this expected further evidence has not provided us with a stronger case to meet the test of sufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction			2
’ she said that without witnesses prosecutors would not be able in court to rebut the defendant ’s claim that he was acting in self defence			0
‘ in addition , we took into account that he had come forward voluntarily to give his account and that he has no previous convictions , ’ she added			0
two other youths , aged 14 and 17 , who were also at the scene , were earlier released without charge due to insufficient evidence			1
another neighbour said : ‘ i sincerely hope the lad feels some remorse over the death of a wonderful man and a gifted surgeon who saved and extended so many lives			0
’ the mother of the teenage boy , whose identity is protected by law , said : ‘ we have been advised by our solicitor not to make any comment until after the coroner has held an inquest			0
’ sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			0

@entity3 , 68 , found lying next to his white @entity173 near home in @entity67 , last march
charges against 17 - year - old dropped after ' supporting evidence ' *emerges*
two other youths , aged 14 and 17 at the time , who were also at the scene were earlier released without charge due to insufficient evidence
