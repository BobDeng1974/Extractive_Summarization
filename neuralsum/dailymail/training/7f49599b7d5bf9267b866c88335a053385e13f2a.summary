by @entity0 in a report dr @entity2 recommends charging parents who earn more than £ 80,000 for state school paces @entity7 parents should be charged £ 20,000 a year for their children to attend the best state schools , a leading headmaster has said			1
they would become liable for the fees if they had a combined household income of £ 80,000 a year or more			0
dr @entity14 , master of £ 11,000 - a - term @entity12 in @entity13 , also said private schools should set aside a quarter of places for poorer pupils			1
making the wealthy pay for state education would end the wasteful and unfair gap between the academic achievements and career prospects of the richest and poorest children in the @entity24 , he argued			1
in a report to be published by the @entity27 think - tank on wednesday , he said the money could be used to pay for more teachers and smaller classes			0
dr @entity2 , who said he had discussed his plans with politicians from both main parties , added that the move was vital because social mobility in @entity24 had stalled , with poorer children unable to advance			1
‘ we have to end this unfair farce whereby middle - class parents dominate the best schools , when they could afford to pay , and even boast of their moral superiority in using the state system when all they are doing is squeezing out the poor from the best schools , ’ he said			2
his suggested starting point for fees – £ 80,000 – is the average income of the top 10 per cent of the population , but ‘ the more the parents earn , the more they should pay ’			2
dr @entity2 , who is master at £ 11,000 - a - term @entity12 in @entity13 , says private schools should reserve a quarter of all places for the poorest children families earning more than £ 200,000 a year with children at the most over-subscribed state schools would pay the most – up to £ 20,000 a year for a secondary place and £ 15,000 for a primary place , equivalent to the fees of a private school			1
‘ grammar schools , popular academies and comprehensives would be the most expensive schools , ’ dr @entity2 said			2
just 3 per cent of pupils at the country ’s 166 grammar schools come from the poorest homes			0
dr @entity2 added it was only fair that if parents could afford to pay for better schooling – secured by buying houses in the right catchment areas or paying for private tutors to help their children pass grammar school entry exams – they should be made to do so			1
‘ instead of estate agents and private tutors getting rich , let ’s put this money into the state system , ’ he said			0
parents are paying an average of £ 31,500 more for a house near the top 30 state schools , according to research by @entity88 , while one in three parents say they have moved to be closer to one			2
according to the @entity88 research the most expensive catchment area around @entity91 all - girls grammar school in @entity93 , north - west @entity94 , where the average house price includes a premium of 87 % , or £ 402,600			0
@entity98 primary school was recently named by @entity99 as one of the best in the country , and an average house in the village costs £ 316,000 , compared with just £ 209,000 for a property nearby @entity106			0
likewise in @entity108 , @entity109 , where @entity112 - @entity111 school is located , houses go for an average of £ 404,000 , up 5 per cent on last year , whereas a similar houses in @entity115 sell for just £ 235,000 .			0
