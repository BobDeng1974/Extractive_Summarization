he said : ' my idea would be to have the teacher sit the exam themselves , along with the students			0
' after all , how can they be expected to pass on their knowledge to students to allow them to succeed in the exam , if they themselves could not ? ' this would help improve teaching standards because if a teacher did poorly , this could be looked into and their skills improved upon			2
' his comments came as it emerged that @entity37 still plays a leading role in shaping the government 's education policy , according to the schools minister			0
@entity42 said the conservative chief whip , who was moved from the @entity44 in last summer 's cabinet reshuffle , joins @entity46 and the @entity47 in dictating policy rather than education secretary @entity10			1
