a new washing machine that uses virtually no water could give a whole new meaning to ‘ dry cleaning ’			1
instead the technology uses millions of tiny plastic beads that remove stains and odours from garments			1
the company behind the technology , @entity11 , claims the process is not only more effective at cleaning clothes , but it ’s also far more efficient			2
the nylon polymer beads have an inherent polarity that attracts stains in a similar way to how your white nylon garments can get dingy over			2
however , under humid conditions , the polymer changes and becomes absorbent			2
dirt is not just attracted to the surface , it is absorbed into the centre			2
after the water dissolves the stains , the dirt is absorbed into the centre of the beads , where it remains trapped			1
after the cycle is complete , the beads are spun out of the load through holes in the drum , where they then return back to s sump pump and are reused			1
the polymer beads also cut down the amount of detergent needed to clean clothes , and can be used for up to 500 loads before they need to be replaced			2
strangely , the researchers that developed this technology at @entity55 were initially attempting to solve a completely different problem			2
professor @entity57 wanted to find out how to help dyes stay on fabrics for longer			0
but he realised the process could work in reverse to remove stains			0
not long after the breakthrough , the group developed a prototype , and a spin out company called @entity11			0
during the wash cycle , more than a million tiny polymer beads are added into the load along with a cup of water and a few drop of @entity11 ’s special detergent			1
the machines are thought to require less than ten per cent of the water used in normal washing machines			0
they also use just a fraction of the electricity needed to complete a cycle with a traditional machine the nylon polymer has an inherent polarity that attracts stains in a similar way to how your white nylon garments can get dingy over			1

after the cycle is complete , the beads are spun out of the load through holes in the drum , where they then return back to a sump pump and are reused			1
the machines are thought to require less than 20 per cent of the water used in normal washing machines			0
they also use just 50 per cent of the electricity needed to complete a cycle with a traditional machine			1
the beads also resist dye transfer between colours and whites , so less wash cycles need to be completed			0
currently , the technology is only available for hotels and large launderettes , but the company plans to create a household version in the near future			0
' the bead - cleaning system is now being developed for domestic laundry use and research is underway to explore how it can be applied in other applications including leather processing , ' said @entity11 chief executive , @entity129			0

in humidity , plastic becomes absorbent and traps dirt within beads ' core
after cycle is complete , the plastic beads are spun out and can be reused
if all @entity21 households converted to the technology , it would save around seven million tonnes of water per week
