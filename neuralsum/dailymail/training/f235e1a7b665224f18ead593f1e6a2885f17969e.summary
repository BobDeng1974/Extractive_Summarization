@entity0 , who has a new documentary series starting on @entity2 later this month surely it seems only about five minutes since @entity0 was the chubby - cheeked , pre-teen , sensible eldest son of the @entity5 family in @entity6			1
but now here he is , aged 18 and all chiselled - features and startling blue eyes , and very much a young man with opinions			2
after six years of being one of @entity12 ’s favourite sitcoms , outnumbered may have finished but @entity0 is still very much in demand			1
he ’s still acting and recently completed a second series of @entity2 ’s @entity15 , but in the meantime he ’s turned into a teenage version of @entity18			2
in his new documentary series , @entity20			1
, he investigates what it ’s like being a teenager in @entity12 today			1
among the topics @entity0 has picked are internet ­ dating and body image — including the modern cult of the ‘ selfie ’			1
one of the most disturbing topics he tackles is pornography			1
and here @entity0 has — somewhat shockingly — a very ­ personal perspective on an industry ­ ruthlessly targeting modern teens			1
his full name is @entity0 — an amalgamation of the names of his parents , who were both involved in the porn industry and , in fact , made a fortune from it			1
his father is @entity47 , one of the porn industry ’s most famous names both for starring in and producing porn films , while his mother @entity51 was a ­ glamour model , video porn star ( she gave it up when @entity0 was born ) and the editor of porn magazine @entity55			1
before the internet , there was a lot of money to be made from porn videos ; @entity0 grew up in a £ 2 million house in @entity62 and was sent to the best schools			1
almost inevitably , at his private school , @entity65 , bullies would taunt him about what his parents did ; he never showed them how much it hurt			2
‘ i did n’t react , i would laugh it off and they realised it would n’t work , ’ he says defiantly			2
‘ i did get upset , not because of what they were saying but why they were saying it			2
‘ why were they trying to hurt me ? it made me think they did n’t like me			2
that ’s what i could n’t understand ; i would n’t want to deliberately upset someone			2
’ he insists he was never embarrassed about how his parents made their living : it ’s all he ever knew			1
‘ they were always very open with me , ’ he says			0
‘ there was no shouting or anything like that , but my dad was worried that i would find something with him in it , ’ he says			0
he was forced to leave his private school after his gcses when his parents divorced after 30 years together , and suddenly the money — which had been dwindling due to the rise of free porn on the internet — ran out			1
he could have paid for the school fees ­ himself with his earnings from @entity109 , but preferred to save his money and taught himself his a-levels in @entity112 , @entity113 and psychology , while living in a small , rented house with his mother			0
he admits that until he made the new documentary — which features him interviewing his parents — he saw pornography only as harmless fun			1
it was a world he grew up in and his father , whose home is full of porn awards and sex toys , talks openly about it			2
but looking at the subject with an objective film - maker ’s eye , and meeting young men addicted to porn and seeing how it affects all of today ’s teenagers , has led to a damascene - style conversion			1
‘ when it comes to porn , the internet has changed everything , ’ he says			2
‘ you used to have to go to a shop and buy a dvd if you wanted to watch anything like that			0
but now all you have to do is type some words into @entity144 and it ’s all there for you — and it ’s free			0
porn baron : @entity47 , also known as @entity47 , is pictured with a model at a @entity151 party in 2009 @entity0 's parents @entity47 who is also known as @entity47 , left , and @entity51 , right , pictured with her son were both involved in the porn industry ‘ there are not enough ­ barriers to stop really young kids watching it			1
‘ it replaces sex education and there is a whole generation who are growing up with a really warped view about what sex should be about			0
it feels like this generation is an accident waiting to happen because of our easy access to porn from such a young age			1
’ what hit @entity0 hardest about the dangers of sex films on the internet was when he interviewed a teenage girl whose boyfriend had become hooked on watching rape scenes on porn sites and then started acting out his fantasies without her consent			1
‘ she was traumatised , and it showed me that porn can ruin lives if it ’s not used properly , ’ he recalls			2
‘ it was a massive eye - opener			0
she was raped repeatedly by her boyfriend , but the interesting thing is she did n’t seem to have any real resentment towards him ; she saw them both as victims of pornography			2
’ @entity0 played the role of @entity196 in @entity109 and still sees his on - screen siblings @entity198 and @entity199 there is , indeed , a lot to worry about when it comes to the mental health of our teenagers			1
but as his critical judgments on the porn industry suggest , @entity0 seems a well - balanced and thoughtful young man			1
he ’s been in the public eye since winning the role of @entity196 in @entity109 when he was 12 after being spotted during a school production of ­ @entity212			0
the show ended earlier this year , mainly because @entity0 and his on - screen siblings are now teenagers rather than cute kids saying funny little things			1
‘ i ’m sad @entity109 has come to an end , but it ’s not the kind of sadness where i wish it had kept on going , ’ he says			0
‘ when something is ready to finish — and this was — it would be detrimental to keep flogging it			0
with his outnumbered days over , @entity0 , centre , is planning on spending time in @entity112 to get to grips with the language ‘ it ’s given me a brilliant start to my career , but i ’m grown up now and this is my next venture			1
i feel like i ’ve got interesting things to say and i would love to do more documentaries as well as carrying on acting			0
’ he still sees his on - screen siblings , @entity198 , 14 , and @entity235 , 13 , who were the closest thing he ’s ever had to a real brother and sister			0
he ’s funny in an older - brother way when he talks about them			0
‘ we are close but our different ages makes it hard for us to do things together , ’ @entity0 says			1
‘ @entity245 is hitting puberty , going to concerts and kissing boys and it ’s weird , because that ’s not a world i ’m into any more			0
you do n’t realise how 13 - year - old - ish a 13 - year - old is until they reach that age			0
‘ when they were younger , i was more like a big brother and they were cute , but now they have become their own people and are very intelligent and argue with me			0
‘ we get invited to functions together , such as the fifth anniversary of the musical @entity261 , and that ’s always fun ; but if we try to make our own arrangements it ’s hard , because @entity245 is sitting exams and @entity266 normally playing rugby			0
’ @entity0 , meanwhile , is having to adjust to a life of no school and no @entity109			2
later this year , after a spate of auditions for his next project , he wants to travel and have a period of not working , for the first time since he was 12			0
he is planning to spend time in @entity112 getting to grips with the language			0
‘ to me , language is the most fascinating thing in the world , ’ he says			0
‘ i love the way ­ languages can mean the same thing but do n’t translate ­ completely into each other			0
if i never acted again , i would love to be a translator			0
’ it ’s still hard being a teenager , but @entity0 seems to be coping pretty well			1
‘ the most important thing is to be happy with who you are , ’ he says			0
begins on @entity2 on may 15 at 9pm .			0
