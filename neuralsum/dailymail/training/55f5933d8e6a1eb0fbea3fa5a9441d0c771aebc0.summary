by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 18:01 est , 3 september 2013 updated : 03:30 est , 4 september 2013 crippling staff shortages and a failing system to screen criminals have left @entity7 ’s borders in a state of chaos , officials warn today			1
terrorists and offenders are slipping through the net , while tens of millions of passengers are arriving on flights and ferries without proper background checks , they say			1
in a devastating report , @entity17 ’s spending watchdog highlighted massive security flaws at the country ’s ports and airports			1
chaos : officials were more worried about queuing times than rigorous checks open border : crippling staff shortages mean that officials are being pulled off key checks for drugs , weapons and illegal migrants the inquiry by the @entity34 found the database used to stop terrorists , dangerous criminals and illegal immigrants getting into @entity7 – the @entity40 system – is deeply ‘ unstable ’			1
border security is being undermined by staff shortages , with immigration officials being pulled off checks on drugs , weapons and illegal migrants to help hit passenger queue targets , it said			1
it also uncovered a ‘ culture of fear ’ within the agency that prevents staff from raising the alarm over border lapses			0
meanwhile , personal details on one third of the 106million people entering @entity7 every year are not handed over in advance , meaning nearly 40million do not undergo background checks before they land			1
flying visit : mps warned that border checks are so lax that so - called ' @entity62 criminals ' are flying into @entity7 and out again on the same day the audit ’s results came as @entity59 warned border checks in @entity7 are so lax that the country is at the mercy of ‘ @entity62 criminals ’ who fly in and out on the same day without detection			1
in an evidence session with police , @entity72 chairman @entity71 said foreign nationals with convictions overseas can enter the @entity7 , go on a crime spree and then leave hours later without being caught			2
even if police are hunting them , they are not stopped because border guards are not checking people as they leave the country			0
@entity82 : @entity72 chairman @entity71 said foreign nationals with convictions overseas can enter the @entity7 , go on a crime spree and then leave hours later without being caught of the criminals who are being trapped by @entity7 ’s biggest force , an astonishing 28 per cent a year – or around 70,000 – are born overseas			1
half of them are from inside the @entity89 , where cheap flights to @entity7 on budget airlines are readily available			2
some 35 per cent of the foreign criminals have convictions at home but nothing was done to stop them entering the @entity7			2
incredibly , 8 per cent of the foreign nationals picked up by the @entity98 in @entity99 were wanted by police in their homeland but still arrived here unhindered			0
police commander @entity102 replied : ‘ that is a matter for the @entity104 because i do n’t police people leaving the country			0
’ the @entity34 inquiry focused on the @entity40 system to check for foreign criminals			2
it was set up in the early 1990s and was designed to last just seven years , but it has now been running for more than 20			0
@entity118 by intelligence from immigration authorities , police , security services and foreign governments , it will raise a ‘ red flag ’ when a suspect trying to enter the country has their passport scanned			0
this should prompt immigration officials to detain them for questioning			0
@entity126 , of @entity127 and @entity128 , has described it as the ‘ single most important electronic check carried out by the @entity104 on passengers arriving in the @entity7 ’			1
but the @entity34 said the @entity40 system ‘ contains a great deal of out - of - date information ’			0
officials warned that as well as duplicate data it also contains a raft of errors such as the misspelling of a name which could allow a wanted criminal to waltz into @entity7 unchecked			2
worrying : officials warned that as well as duplicate data it also contains a raft of errors such as the misspelling of a name which could allow a wanted criminal to waltz into @entity7 unchecked the whole system is ‘ now unstable and at risk of collapsing ’ , they said			1
as part of the £ 1.2billion e-borders scheme to check those entering @entity7 , airlines and ferry companies are meant to send information about their passengers in advance of flights arriving in @entity7			1
labour ministers had intended the scheme to cover 95 per cent of flights by 2010 but the report revealed they are only collecting information on 63 per cent of passengers , meaning nearly 40million out of 106million arrivals are not advance checked before they reach @entity7			1
furthermore , a ministerial edict to hit queue targets , combined with staff shortages , meant there were not enough officials to carry out lorry searches for illegal stowaways or to search for weapons , drugs , counterfeit goods and cigarettes , the report said			1
auditors said lorry searches were suspended 22 times in three days in april this year to deal with queues or to allow staff to take meal breaks			0
staff were also ‘ too busy ’ to properly interrogate arrivals suspected of intending to remain in @entity7 illegally – allowing in hundreds every month who should have been turned away			2
in april last year the numbers refused entry fell to 64 per cent of the target			0
mp @entity191 , chairman of the public accounts committee , said it was ‘ deeply worrying ’ that the @entity195 drive to cut queuing time came ‘ at the expense of its other responsibilities ’			0
between 2010 and 2012 , some 500 staff were cut out of the 8,000 @entity195 workforce , as its budget fell by nearly £ 50million			0
@entity204 , head of the @entity34 , said : ‘ @entity205 must be able to check both goods and passengers at the same time – border security can not be an ‘ either / or ’ choice			2
’ immigration minister @entity210 said : ' the @entity7 operates one of the most secure borders in the world and i am pleased the @entity34 recognises the success of @entity195 in implementing full passenger checks while also reducing queue times			1
‘ we inherited an organisation with significant challenges and , while some of these remain , i am confident that under the long term leadership of the new director general , sir @entity224 , @entity195 will continue to build on its many areas of excellence			0
‘ we have recruited more @entity195 staff , established command centres to deploy those staff more flexibly and effectively and are reforming working practices			0
’ concern : @entity191 , @entity233 member of parliament and chairwoman of the @entity235 ( @entity235 ) , described the report findings as ' deeply worrying '			0
