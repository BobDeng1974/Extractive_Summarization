by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 18:55 est , 12 september 2013 updated : 05:45 est , 13 september 2013 prince @entity2 and @entity3 , his nanny in the 1990s			1
she will now look after @entity5 they had hoped to do it all themselves			1
but , as many new parents have realised before them , sometimes you need an extra pair of hands			2
the @entity14 and @entity15 have bowed to the inevitable and hired a nanny for their seven - week - old son , @entity5			1
they have decided to keep it in the family , however – asking @entity2 ’s former nanny , @entity3 , to come out of retirement and lend a hand part - time			1
palace sources had let it be known as recently as june that the pair had no plans to pay for extra care			2
but , sources admit , @entity2 and @entity15 have quickly realised they are not a ‘ super-couple ’ and need some help , particularly as the duchess is slowly returning to limited royal duties			1
miss @entity3 , 71 , cared for the prince and his brother , @entity33 , in the early 1990s			1
she was eventually let go by @entity34 , who often became jealous of those her sons grew close to			0
but @entity2 , now 31 , enjoyed a warm , loving relationship with his nannies , and has always regarded miss @entity3 fondly			1
he ensured she was a guest of honour at both his 21st birthday party and his wedding two years ago			1
now , some 25 years on , she is looking after @entity2 ’s own son – and the @entity43 believe @entity5 could n’t be in better hands			1
@entity45 was on duty last night when the couple took to the red carpet for only their second official engagement since their son ’s birth on july 22			0
a senior royal source told the @entity55 that she was working for the @entity43 on an ‘ ad hoc ’ basis			0
‘ @entity3 is helping the couple out , ’ the source said			1
‘ it was a very recent decision			0
’ miss @entity3 was first employed by @entity60 and his wife to look after @entity2 and @entity33 when the future king was seven and about to start at prep school			1
it was the spring of 1990			0
while to the outside world all seemed well , miss @entity3 soon found herself walking a tightrope as @entity60 and @entity34 ’s relationship disintegrated			1
‘ @entity34 was often in tears and there were frequent rows , ’ a former @entity69 figure recalled			0
‘ @entity3 did not see it as her job to console the princess , so she did her bit to keep the children occupied and out of the way			1
’ miss @entity3 ( left ) next to princess @entity34 and prince @entity2 at @entity33 's school sports day in 1992 in their private lives the royal couple had already made their choices			1
the prince had returned to the warm embrace of his former love , @entity86 , and @entity34 was being consoled by @entity88 officer @entity87			2
indeed , while on the surface it still seemed so normal , the reality was that by now the prince and princess were not just living separate lives but also maintaining separate homes			2
increasingly , @entity60 remained at @entity95 during the week , while @entity34 and the boys were in @entity97			0
it was against this background that miss @entity3 began her duties			1
for generations , royal nannies had been picked from a relatively limited social circle			0
but with her warm @entity105 informality and no - nonsense approach , miss @entity3 seemed just the person to bring a bit of much - needed cheer into the household			1
miss @entity3 enjoyed a healthy appetite herself and she thought the boys , especially @entity33 , needed feeding up			1
the nursery fridge groaned with sausages , bacon , buns , cakes of every description , and biscuits			0
family : the @entity14 , prince @entity2 and @entity15 , @entity121 with their son , @entity5 in the garden of the @entity125 home in @entity126 , @entity127 but the food all went			1
indeed chef @entity129 was once overheard saying of miss @entity3 : ‘ if i [ did n’t ] lock the kitchen door we would have no food left			1
’ little boys , she would tell anyone who was listening , needed meat and potatoes			0
at first her large , reassuring presence helped diffuse the often fraught atmosphere between @entity60 and @entity34 , who by now were scarcely talking to each other			0
she took charge on weekend trips to @entity143 , where the boys played with their own cut - down polo sticks			2
miss @entity3 , often described as a ‘ like a ship in full sail ’ , seemed untroubled by the gathering marital storm			1
the @entity15 arriving at the inaugural @entity149 at the @entity150 in @entity97 yesterday ‘ she knew how to swoop up the boys when their parents ’ arguments became too loud , ’ a police bodyguard said			0
when @entity2 went away to @entity155 in the autumn of 1990 , @entity3 had only @entity33 to look after			1
if anything @entity2 ’s absence – @entity34 missed him terribly – made the atmosphere even worse			1
by the summer of 1991 , the fairytale marriage was over in all but name			0
it was inevitable perhaps that as @entity60 and @entity34 lashed out , others got hurt , too			0
‘ in fact both @entity60 and @entity34 had decided it was time she should move on , ’ said a former @entity69 figure			2
‘ he found her too big , too brash and generally too loud			0
@entity34 just stopped talking to her , @entity3 never really knew why			2
’ so it was agreed that she would leave ‘ @entity170 ’ when @entity33 started at @entity155 in the autumn of 1992			0
but @entity3 was not brusquely discarded			2
instead she found work courtesy of @entity34 ’s @entity69 neighbour @entity172			0
she went to work for @entity174 and his wife @entity175 , where she remained for several happy years			0
she then moved to a royal apartment in @entity178 , @entity97 , to enjoy her retirement			0
initially , as revealed by the @entity55 , @entity2 and @entity15 had hoped to do without any outside help for their baby son			2
indeed , the duchess broke with royal tradition and eschewed the services of a maternity nurse after his birth , preferring to go and live with her parents in @entity127 for almost a month			0
neither were keen to advertise for a carer and as far as @entity2 was concerned , there was only one person he trusted for the job : @entity45			2
although not entirely keen to go back to work in view of her age , she was apparently ‘ delighted and flattered ’ to have been asked			0
she has been in @entity197 with the couple for the last week before returning with them to @entity97 on tuesday			0
‘ the truth is she loves @entity2 very much and was happy to do anything she could to help out , ’ a source said .			2

@entity2 hires @entity3 , his childhood nanny , to look after @entity5
the 71 - year - old will lend a hand part - time
the prince is fond of @entity210 , who was a guest of honour at his wedding
