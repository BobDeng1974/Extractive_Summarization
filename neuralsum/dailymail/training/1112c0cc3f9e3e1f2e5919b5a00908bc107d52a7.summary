published : 12:39 est , 7 march 2014 updated : 13:48 est , 7 march 2014 experts are warning against a risky new cocktail trend that encourages drinkers to inhale alcohol rather than swallow it			1
the ' @entity5 ' - glass apparatus designed to heat high volume alcohol - caused uproar in the @entity9 when it was launched in 2012 , with doctors claiming potentially serious side effects as smoking alcohol is toxic to the lungs			1
now the trend appears to be gathering pace in the @entity16 ahead of the summer festival season leading to charities and experts warning young professionals against unsafe alcohol consumption			1
this image from the @entity24 account shows young women heating and inhaling alcohol on a night out first released in december 2012 , the $ 40 ( £ 28 ) @entity5 acts in a manner similar to a traditional vaporizer , heating and releasing intoxicating vapors which are breathed through a straw after being heated by a candle to 140 @entity33			1
bypassing the digestive system , the @entity5 causes alcohol to be ingested directly to the bloodstream through the lungs , potentially causing dangerous levels of intoxication - especially if abused			1
inventor and bar owner @entity40 created the simple glass and steel contraption after a night in @entity44 inhaling vodka fumes over a coal fire			2
she claims that taking the alcohol directly into the bloodstream has the advantage of ' almost no calories , no carbs , no impurities and immediate effects '			1
the alcohol fumes are ingested via a glass straw and pass straight into the blood stream but while the idea of a calorie - free high is appealing to diet - conscious drinkers experts and authorities here have been quick to slam the trend			1
the @entity63 is concerned that the craze will end up costing lives			0
group manager @entity66 said : ' any product which encourages people to light candles when consuming alcohol is a concern			2
we do n’t want to sound like killjoys , but products like the @entity5 could lead to a worrying rise in the number of people being burned and causing fires while drunk			1
' a spokesman told the @entity79 : ' @entity80 believes that heating alcohol in this way could increase the risk of someone having a serious fire which could destroy their home or , even worse , kill them			1
' firefighters are reminding people that drinking and naked flames do n’t mix and that one in four people who die in a fire has alcohol in their system			2
' the figures show that young professionals had 1,515 house fires last year and the @entity63 is concerned that this figure could rise			0
' vaportini sell various kits of apparatus online , with prices starting at $ 40 ( £ 24 ) meanwhile professor @entity105 , advisor to alcohol education charity @entity106 explained the process : ' alcohol is a volatile liquid			1
as temperature rises , it turns to vapour at some 40 degree @entity114 sooner than water			0
thus a beverage from a bottle of spirits , which is part alcohol and part water can be heated and the alcohol vapour inhaled , as those in the kitchen warming @entity123 at @entity124 will recall			1
' it enters through the lung tissue into the bloodstream			0
if a small measure of a spirit , say 1 unit , was heated and inhaled it all enters the blood stream and will still have to be metabolised by the liver in the end , although it is true that there is less immediate ' hit ' on the liver by this method			1
' however , there is greater ' hit ' on the brain , than when alcohol is taken by mouth , because some of it has not already been broken down on its way through the liver and this will increase the risk of damage to brain cells			0
so the method can not be called safer to the body organs			0
' there is an added risk of inhalation which is due to the direct impact on the brain - that is , risk of unsteadiness , falling or impulsive behaviour			0
' it is possible that the vapour method may lead to some taking larger quantities of alcohol than they would have done if they were only ingesting by mouth through the stomach , because the stomach can limit its emptying rate with strong concentrations of spirit , and may sometimes cause vomiting , which is a limiting step			1
' the vapour method will be used by those who are looking for rapid intoxication			2
some unwanted effects of alcohol may also be felt more rapidly , by the consumer and those around			0
' professor @entity177 added : ' the fact that it bypasses your body ’s natural defence mechanisms against consuming too much alcohol means it is unsafe			2
' inhaling alcohol is a very new trend so there is n't yet any scientific data of the effects but it has the potential to be a very dangerous phenomenon and as such , we would advise people to be cautious if indeed they do decide to try it			0
' the alcohol is heated using a small candle or tea light inventor @entity40 created the boozy gadget with the help of her engineer father			2
she says : ' we spent several interesting afternoons testing the best temperature for alcohol to evaporate from spirits			2
we also explored several ways to achieve and sustain that optimal temperate			0
' this led to research in the heat density of many substances , diamonds have the highest heat density , but are completely impractical			0
we settled on lead , but it had to be protected from human contact , for obvious reasons			0
' i found a hollow stainless steel base that could be filled with lead			0
i worked with a local metal worker to fill them			0
the purchased glass vessels were modified , creating an air intake close to the surface of the spirits , insertion of a straw to inhale the evaporated alcohol , and insuring a close contact of the base to the glass vessel			1
i heated the bases in a small oven , filled the vessel with liquor , and placed it in the base			0
within 5 minutes , the alcohol had evaporated from the spirits and was ready to inhale			2

**makers** are calling the @entity5 a ' *revolution* in alcohol consumption '
spirits are inhaled after being heated to *60degrees* using glass apparatus
@entity250 claims that heating alcohol is likely to cause serious *injuries*
doctors are warning that method is untested and unsafe
**makers** boast that benefits *include* no calories and speedy intoxication
