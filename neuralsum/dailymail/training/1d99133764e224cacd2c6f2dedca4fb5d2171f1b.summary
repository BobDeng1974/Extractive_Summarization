@entity10 - based retoucher @entity8 and photographer @entity11 created these images entitled , ' l ’ @entity6 ( @entity7 ) , ' to bring out the inner child in each of the models			1
each photo , originally captured by photographer @entity11 , shows the subject photoshopped to look like a toddler by @entity8			0
each photo is enhanced to emphasise full faces , sloping shoulders , and slightly enlarged heads			0
in some images @entity8 has removed ' milk teeth ' and arranged his model in a child - like pose , with shrugged shoulders and pouting mouths			2
the results combine adult attributes such as beards , and stubble , with the round , rosy cheeks and wide - eyed innocence of youth			1
a project by @entity10 - based retoucher @entity8 and photographer @entity11 aims to bring out the inner child in each of the models l ’ @entity6 ( @entity7 ) ' sees the grown up models assume child - like poses for a photograph which is then tweaked to turn back the clock with pouting lips and wide - eyed innocence they certainly look like children			1
but the clothes , facial hair and make - up tell a different story to achieve the effect , @entity8 kept the main appearances of the subject but tweaked some of their physical attributes , softening arms and shoulders , enlarging heads and widening eyes he filled out cheeks and softened adult curves to give a more childlike silhouette			0
the poses are also typical of children			0
on the left the model appears to be n the verge of a tantrum , and on the right , bashful and shy the artist told the subjects to wear their own clothes in order to give the impression he was bringing out the inner child rather than completely turning back the clock despite some of the models having full facial hair , the artist still manages to capture a childlike quality with the resulting images in some of the subjects he removed ' milk teeth ' to give the impression of childhood			2
but he kept more adult attributes such as hair dye and earrings he manages to perfectly capture the innocence of youth by arranging the subject in a child - like pose , with shrugged shoulders and pouting mouths			0
