this time last year @entity0 were top of the @entity4 table			0
they added @entity6 in the summer , who ’s been excellent , and now they ’re 13 points off top spot , and not even in the top four			0
does n’t make sense does it ? i suspect the @entity15 will eventually finish in their precious @entity17 place			2
but while one stellar signing every summer – @entity20 in 2013 , @entity6 last year – might eventually work over a long period of time , @entity0 fans have waited ages for their manager to get serious in the transfer market , in the title race and in @entity26			0
so maybe @entity0 need to work with more haste			0
look away @entity29 fans - here 's how @entity30 would suit the red and white of @entity0 @entity6 has been an inspired signing for @entity0 but they remain 13 points adrift of leaders @entity35 per @entity36 ( left ) and @entity37 can only reach a certain level ... @entity0 need more than that in essence they need to ' sign a spine			1
' @entity42 might be the long - term solution in goal , if they stick with @entity47 they will definitely need a world - class centre back alongside him			0
a top - level defensive midfielder is a must , and so too a world - class striker			0
@entity0 can keep stumbling along with @entity36 , @entity52 and @entity37 , but on the evidence so far , these players can only reach a certain level			1
for domination at home and abroad ( is n’t that what @entity0 fans want ? ) the @entity15 need to aim high , show some intent and really go for it			0
but there is one player beyond the spine who could make a massive difference , and signing him would be a huge statement from @entity0 in so many ways			2
the @entity15 should go for @entity30			1
@entity30 jumps for joy after scoring @entity71 's second goal in their @entity73 victory over @entity74 @entity30 has come under fire from @entity71 fans and the media ... so , why do n't @entity0 make a move for him ? @entity20 returned to first - team action for @entity0 in their win over @entity81 at the @entity82 on sunday as @entity30 left @entity29 for @entity71 , @entity20 arrived at the @entity82 and @entity0 fans came up with a mildly amusing song to reflect the contrasting transfer fortunes of the north @entity87 rivals			1
to the tune of the @entity91 ’ 1990 hit ' this is how it feels , ' @entity88 sang the words : ' this is how it feels to be @entity29 , ' this is how it feels to be small , ' you sold @entity30 and we signed @entity20 … ' the ditty conveniently ignores that @entity29 also signed @entity102 at that time and he turned out ( so far ) to be far better than @entity20 for a fraction of the price			1
but it ’s still funny			0
@entity30 in action for @entity71 in their @entity73 clash against @entity74 at the @entity108 on saturday @entity30 's play is similar to that of @entity111 in his pomp , pictured here celebrating against @entity113 in 2003 however , @entity30 is under fire in @entity115 for shooting too much			1
sounds ridiculous , but @entity71 fans and the media want him to give the ball to @entity119 more			1
one accusation levelled at @entity122 ’s side is that they do n’t shoot enough , they overplay in and around the box			2
go to a game at the @entity82 and you ’ll often hear fans ’ frustrations when there ’s one pass too many and a promising move breaks down			2
@entity30 ’s direct approach is reminiscent of @entity111 at his peak at @entity0			2
and the pain for @entity29 fans of seeing @entity30 in an @entity0 shirt would be an added bonus for @entity88			1
it would be brilliant for the @entity4 though .			0

@entity71 's @entity30 is under fire in @entity115 for shooting too much
so , why does n't @entity122 make a move for the former @entity29 star ?
they ca n't keep stumbling along with @entity36 and @entity37
