by @entity0 and @entity1 the family of an @entity4 death row inmate executed with a never - before - used drug cocktail are suing the medical manufacturer , saying his death was cruel and unusual punishment			1
@entity9 was put to death on january 16 using a two - drug combination after the state 's previous execution drug dried up			1
he was sentenced to death for the 1989 rape and fatal stabbing of 22 - year - old @entity17 in @entity18 , @entity4			1
it took 26 minutes for @entity20 to die , breaking the record for longest execution since the state resumed capital punishment in 1999			1
during the nearly half - hour it took @entity20 to die , he was observed ' snorting , gurgling and arching his back '			1
' it looked and sounded as though he was suffocating , ' the lawsuit filed in federal court friday reads			0
his family are now suing , saying he was ' tortured ' during the execution experimental : @entity20 was executed at this facility by @entity4 's untested execution method punishment : the death chamber at the @entity42 in @entity43			1
@entity4 used intravenous doses of two drugs , midazolam , a sedative , and hydromorphone , a painkiller , to put @entity20 to death @entity4 has begun using lethal doses of the sedative midazolam and the painkiller hydropmorphone after the @entity55 manufacturer of the previous drug , pentobarbital , stopped allowing its use in lethal injections			1
marketed in @entity62 - speaking countries and @entity63 under the trade names @entity65 , @entity65 , and @entity65 , midazolam is a short - acting sedative in the benzodiazepine class of drugs developed by @entity69 in the 1970s			0
the drug is used for treatment of acute seizures , moderate to severe insomnia , and for inducing sedation and amnesia before medical procedures			0
it possesses profoundly potent anxiolytic , amnestic , hypnotic , anticonvulsant , skeletal muscle relaxant , and sedative properties			0
@entity81 is a very potent centrally acting analgesic drug of the opioid class			0
it is a derivative of morphine			0
an expert in @entity9 's case claimed the two drugs together in lethal doses would very likely cause what 's known as ' air hunger ' or simply an acute shortness of breath			1
the clinical definition of air hunger or dyspnea is an uncomfortable awareness of one 's breathing effort			0
it is a normal symptom of heavy exertion but becomes pathological if it occurs in unexpected situations			0
reports from @entity20 's death chamber suggest this may have in fact occurred			1
as such , the appropriateness of the drugs , and the extent to which they may be cruel , will likely be reviewed by @entity4 officials before they are used in another execution			1
the family is aiming their lawsuit at @entity116 - the @entity118 , @entity117 company that makes the drugs midazolam and hydromorphone			2
on their own , the drugs are actually meant to calm patients during surgery and reduce pain			0
but together , the @entity20 family 's lawyers say they cause ' air hunger ' which is the acute shortness of breath			1
the family claims that the company knew what the drugs were being used for but continued to provide them to the state , knowing they ' would cause unnecessary and extreme pain and suffering during the execution process '			2
another separate lawsuit was filed on thursday in an attempt to stop the scheduled march execution of another @entity4 killer who would be administered the same drugs			1
@entity143 is scheduled to be executed on march 19 for setting an @entity145 man on fire and leaving him to die			0
@entity143 's attorneys say the state is using the drugs illegally since they do n't have a prescription to use them			0
@entity116 provided @entity4 with its previous execution drug - sodium thiopental - but stopped producing it after it could n't guarantee to @entity153 authorities where their factory was located or that the drug would n't be used for capital punishment			1
according to a company statement , @entity116 has prohibited their drugs from being used in executions in the past and will do the same for the midazolam / hydromorphone combination			2
it 's still unclear what @entity20 felt as he slipped away			1
an anesthesiologist hired by @entity20 's attorney say the drugs cause ' air hunger ' which causes the recipient to duffer ' agony and terror ' as they slowly suffocate			1
but another anesthesiologist countered that opinion , saying that while the inmate might snore , the drugs cause no suffering			0
the drugs were n't designed to cause death , @entity178 , the @entity20 family attorney , told the @entity180 friday			1
' there 's a clear distinction between a therapeutic use of a drug in a medical environment as opposed to using that drug in an execution style , ' he said			2
' that 's the concern , that we 're taking drugs that have therapeutic value and we 're not using them for the purposes for which the @entity194 approved nor for which the clinical tests were performed , ' he added			0
victim : @entity20 , 53 , was sentenced to die for the 1989 rape and fatal stabbing of @entity17 in @entity18 in western @entity4			1
the 22 - year - old @entity199 was newly married and pregnant the @entity33 @entity200 rejected a last - minute request to delay @entity20 's execution on the grounds that a jury never got to hear the full extent of his chaotic and abusive childhood			1
the court 's denial included no explanation			0
@entity20 was sentenced to die for raping and killing @entity17 , 22 , in 1989			1
@entity199 's slaying went unsolved for 10 months until @entity20 , jailed on an unrelated assault and hoping to improve his legal situation , told investigators he had information about the woman 's february 12 , 1989 , death			1
his attempts to blame the crime on his brother - in - law quickly unraveled and soon he was accused of being @entity199 's killer , according to prosecutors			2
more than a decade later , dna evidence confirmed @entity20 's guilt , and he acknowledged that he was responsible in a letter to governor @entity226 last month			2
' one can scarcely conceive of a sequence of crimes more shocking to the conscience or to moral sensibilities than the senseless kidnapping and rape of a young , pregnant woman followed by her murder , ' @entity18 prosecutors said in a filing with the state parole board last month			2
his attorneys argued @entity20 was mentally , physically and sexually abused as a child and had impaired brain function that made him prone to act impulsively			2
' @entity9 was at risk from the moment he was born , ' the lawyers said in a parole board filing			2
' the lack of proper nutrition , chaotic home environment , abuse , lack of positive supervision and lack of positive role models all affected @entity9 ' brain development			0
' documents obtained by @entity180 show @entity20 unsuccessfully sought a reprieve in recent weeks to try to become an organ donor			0
in november , @entity226 granted a death row inmate an eight - month reprieve to let the prison system study his request to donate a kidney to his sister and his heart to his mother			0
@entity226 said @entity20 could n't identify a family member who would receive his organs , as required under prison policy			2
new drugs : @entity4 officials used intravenous doses of the sedative midazolam and the painkiller hydromorphone to put @entity20 , pictured at an undated court hearing , to death crime scene : the pregnant 22 - year - old was found dead in a dark wood , pictured , in 1989 in the letter @entity280 's sister wrote , she described her 10 - years - younger , adopted sister as the light of her family 's life			1
' she was born @entity285 , 1966 but i have n't spoken to her in more than 24 years			0
her voice was silenced on february 11 , 1989 when @entity9 brutally ended her life			2
' @entity289 said the soon - to - be mom was excited about the birth of her baby boy , who tragically died too the day of the murder			2
' she never got to realize her dreams , never got to hold her baby boy in her arms , never got to kiss his soft cheek , never got to see him smile , ' she wrote			0
@entity289 described how the grief following @entity280 's murder destroyed her parents			0
' they never fully recovered and both died knowing that her killer still lived , ' she said			0
regarding the contentious lethal injection @entity20 was given , @entity289 wrote : ' there has been a lot of controversy regarding the drugs that are to be used in his execution , concern that he might feel terror , that he might suffer			1
' as i recall the events preceding her death ; forcing her from the car , attempting to rape her vaginally , sodomizing her , choking her , stabbing her , leaving her to bleed out : i know she suffered terror and pain			0
' he is being treated far more humanely than he treated her			0

@entity9 's family say the drug cocktail used to kill him caused him to suffer as he died
it took @entity20 26 minutes to die - the longest execution since @entity4 resumed capital punishment in 1999
they are now suing the drug 's manufacturer to get the combination banned in executions
@entity20 was *convicted* of the 1989 rape and murder of a 22 - year - old western @entity4 woman
