the office of @entity8 , the parliamentary commissioner for standards , said he was opening an inquiry following a complaint that mrs @entity1 had claimed more than £ 90,000 in second home allowances towards the cost of a house where her parents lived			1
the complaint was lodged earlier this week by @entity18 mp @entity17 , who claimed the arrangement was ‘ identical ’ to that of former labour minister @entity21 , who in 2009 was required to repay more than £ 13,000 claimed on a second home occupied by his parents			1
in that case , the commissioner said mr @entity21 , who lost his seat in the 2010 general election , had effectively ‘ subsidised ’ his parents from the public purse by allowing them to live rent - free			2

despite the probe , @entity38 yesterday declared his full backing for his culture secretary , saying : ‘ @entity1 does an absolutely excellent job as @entity1 and she has my full support			2
‘ a newspaper has asked her a number of questions			0

the minister defended her expenses in an interview with the @entity66 , saying : ‘ those expenses have been audited twice independently so i think everything ’s in order			0
' i obviously spoke to the @entity70 about my claims and they were happy that everything was in order			0
’ however , she admitted one of the ‘ independent ’ audits was carried out by the @entity77			0
asked why she suddenly stopped claiming on the @entity56 home in 2009 as the wider expenses scandal erupted , she replied : ‘ because i think there was a lot of concern about the rules and , er , a lot of concern about , you know , the whole issue , and it ’s something i felt that i did n’t want to be , sort of , mixed up in , the fact that i ... i just made that decision			0
’ no 10 refused to confirm whether the prime minister and @entity1 had met or talked by telephone about the claims			2
mrs @entity1 ’s special adviser @entity93 is reported to have called the @entity94 and , during discussions about mrs @entity1 ’s expenses , said she wanted to ‘ flag up ’ the cabinet minister ’s involvement with the @entity100 on press regulation			1
@entity103 ’s top spin doctor @entity102 was also accused of mentioning the @entity105 reforms in a call to the newspaper ’s editor			1
@entity110 leader @entity109 highlighted the ‘ antics ’ of @entity115 in the @entity110 , claiming the intervention was an attempt to put pressure on the @entity94			0
