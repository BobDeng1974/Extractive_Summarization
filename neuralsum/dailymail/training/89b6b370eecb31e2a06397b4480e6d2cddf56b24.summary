' consumers need to know that these energy drinks can be dangerous , and even lethal , especially to young people and people with heart problems			0
' it 's especially important that consumers learn about these risks because the energy drink companies do not put appropriate warnings on the cans or their advertisements telling people about these dangers			0

powerful : the company claims that the drink has safe levels of caffeine but says its target is for over 18s monster and other energy drinks have received increased scrutiny in recent months			1
the @entity67 is investigating reports of deaths linked to energy drinks , including five that cite @entity64 beverages , but the agency noted that the reports do n't prove the drinks caused the deaths			1

it also says the drink is n't recommended for children , people sensitive to caffeine , pregnant women or women who are nursing			0
but @entity101 city attorney @entity100 has pointed out that three cans amount to 480 milligrams of caffeine , nearly five times the recommended maximum for adolescents and above the 400 milligrams per day the @entity67 has indicated is safe for adults			2
the autopsy and toxicity reports found no illegal drugs or alcohol in his system			0
a cardiac arrhythmia is an electrical problem with the rate or rhythm of the heartbeat , meaning it can beat too slow or too fast			0

' it is hard for all of @entity9 's family and friends to relive the terrible moments of his death , ' she said			2
' but we can not be silent while more seemingly - healthy young adults like @entity9 are putting their lives at risk , and we do not want any other parents to experience the devastation of losing their child			0
' monster representatives did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment			0
@entity64 has previously said its target market is for 18 to 34 year olds but that its drinks are nevertheless safe for children as well			1
