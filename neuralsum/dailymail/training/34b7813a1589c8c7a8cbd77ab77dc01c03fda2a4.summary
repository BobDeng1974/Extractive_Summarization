it was a turning point in the war , when only the bravery of @entity3 who took to the skies to defend their country stood between @entity7 and the might of @entity10 ’s @entity9			2
but less than half of today ’s secondary school pupils know the @entity14 was fought in the air , a poll has revealed			0
only 62 per cent could correctly identify a photograph of sir @entity18 , it found – but 92 per cent recognised a picture of @entity18 the insurance dog			1
' oh yes ' ? more like ' @entity21 ' : over 90 per cent recognised the dog from the @entity24 advertisements yet only a measly 62 per cent of the students polled could identify sir @entity18 more could identify @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity28 than their country ’s wartime leader			1
only a third of 11 to 18 - year - olds know the @entity33 began in 1939 , according to a poll by former @entity36 deputy chairman @entity35 , while only one in five knows what happened on @entity39			1
the survey of 1,000 children at secondary schools across @entity7 was commissioned to mark the unveiling of the @entity44 in @entity45 later this week			0
its results will heighten concern about the quality of history teaching in our schools			0
it found that only 34 per cent of pupils – including 45 per cent of those aged 17 and 18 – knew the @entity33 began in 1939			1
only 39 per cent knew it ended in 1945 , again including only 45 per cent of 17 and 18 - year - olds			1
the @entity44 which will be unveiled in a ceremony attended by the @entity58 , including @entity59 and the @entity60 in @entity45 's @entity61 on thursday forty - three per cent knew the @entity14 was fought in the air , 29 per cent believed it was fought on land , and 8 per cent at sea			1
twenty per cent admitted they did not know			2
just 34 per cent correctly said the @entity14 took place in the 1940s , and only 11 per cent of these – about one in 27 of the whole sample – knew it happened in 1940			2
only a fifth of children had any idea of what happened on d - day , with the most frequent answer being the day the war ended			1
eighty - six per cent correctly said there had been two world wars – but one in 20 thought there had been three			1
nearly a third were unable to give any unprompted explanation of why @entity7 fought in the @entity33 and while 89 per cent identified @entity10 as an adversary during the conflict , only 15 per cent could name @entity83 unprompted			1
nearly a quarter thought @entity7 ’s enemies had included @entity85 , @entity86 , @entity87 , the @entity88 , @entity89 or @entity90			2
only 61 per cent correctly named the @entity88 as an ally of @entity7 ’s in the @entity33			1
one in ten thought our allies had included @entity94 , @entity10 or @entity83			2
more people could identify @entity26 and @entity28 than sir @entity18 when the children were offered four different explanations for what @entity98 is or was , only 36 per cent correctly said it had been part of the @entity101			1
there was some encouraging news , however - 95 per cent correctly identified the @entity105 ’s poppy , and 84 per cent knew what it signified			2
lord @entity35 , who made a £ 1 million donation towards the new @entity44 , which is being unveiled on thursday , said : ' it is sobering to find that so many children of secondary school age simply do not know important facts about crucial events in @entity7 ’s recent history			0
' my own father fought in d - day , and i was keen to discover how much today ’s young people know of what happened just 70 years ago			1
' i do n’t mean to criticise the children			0
we must all take responsibility for ensuring that what we know is passed to the next generation			0
these findings show we can never be complacent about our duty to remember			0
' one of the ways we can do this is to build lasting memorials to those who have sacrificed so much to serve our country			0
that is the purpose of the @entity44 , which i am proud to support			0
' @entity134 is long overdue			0
those who flew on countless missions over @entity10 and occupied @entity137 , many of whom were barely out of their teenage years , knew the odds were stacked against them , and many did not return			0
' all of us should be thankful for the sacrifice they made to ensure that we can all live in a free society			0

*30* per cent more students recognised the dog from @entity24 's advertisements than war leader sir @entity18
only a third knew @entity33 began in 1939 and a fifth thought it ended on d - day
one in 20 thought there had been three world wars
