the @entity6 hate preacher has spent eight years fighting deportation to @entity9 , inflicting a string of humiliating human rights court defeats on the government and costing taxpayers £ 3.6million in the process			2
but @entity16 ’s lawyers now say he will board a plane without any further protest if @entity4 and @entity9 ratify a treaty guaranteeing him a fair trial back home			1
remaining in @entity4 ? @entity2 's legal team have used a hearing today to pledge he will leave the @entity4 for @entity9 if a non-torture treaty is signed @entity26 welcomed the news , saying : ‘ we have a fully worked - out plan to get this man out of our country , and if he goes of his own accord , frankly , i ’ll be one of the happiest people in @entity4			1
’ it means the @entity36 cleric , once described as @entity38 ’s right - hand man in @entity39 , could leave within months			0
once he is out of the country , security officials will put a block on the fanatic ever being allowed to return to the @entity4			2

mr @entity50 also said that his client , who is being held in @entity52 on bail violations , wanted to spend some time with his family before leaving for @entity9			1
the @entity55 released this image of home secretary @entity57 signing the fair trial guarantees with @entity9 that she believes will reassure courts that torture evidence would not be used against @entity2 @entity26 is considering a temporary withdrawal from the @entity39 human rights convention in order to finally remove @entity2 from @entity4 still smiling : labour and conservative ministers have been trying to deport @entity16 for a decade but have failed september 16 1993 - the @entity9 father of five claims asylum when he arrives in @entity4 on a forged passport			1

august 2005 - the preacher is arrested under immigration rules as the government seeks to deport him to @entity9			2
april 2008 - the @entity87 rules that deporting him would breach his human rights because evidence used against him in @entity9 may have been obtained through torture			1

he gave no indication as to whether they would be joining him in @entity9 , where he faces terror charges after being convicted in his absence in 1999			0
but it is understood there is no legal basis for forcibly removing his wife and five children from their taxpayer - funded home in @entity49			0
two of the children were born in @entity4			0
the breakthrough is a victory for @entity57 , who announced last month that she had thrashed out a mutual assistance treaty with @entity9 , guaranteeing @entity16 the right to a fair trial			1
human rights judges in @entity4 and @entity141 had halted his removal to @entity9 on the grounds some of the evidence used against him may have been obtained by torture			1
mr @entity50 said mrs may ’s treaty had been the key development in the case			0
he added : ‘ in light of that treaty i ’m authorised to say that if , and when , the @entity9 parliament ratifies the treaty he will voluntarily return to @entity9			1
’ the new treaty is expected to be ratified in the @entity4 next month and a @entity9 minister has suggested it could be cleared in his country within a matter of months			1
after telling the hearing of @entity16 ’s pledge to leave , mr @entity50 attempted to secure his client ’s release from @entity52 to his home in north @entity49			1
he said : ‘ bail conditions can be as stringent as possible			2
even , if necessary , 24 hours in the house			0
’ mr @entity50 insisted @entity16 ’s pledge to return voluntarily to @entity9 meant there was no longer a threat that he could abscond			2
he said : ‘ all he wants , when obviously he is planning to go back to @entity9 , is some time with his family			0
‘ the risk of @entity174 , which was a major concern , has gone			0
’ @entity176 , appearing for the home secretary , said the treaty would be put before the @entity9 parliament in the next few weeks , while the @entity4 side of the process should be completed by late june			1
mr @entity181 asked mr @entity182 to provide evidence of the process in the @entity4 and @entity9 in bringing the treaty into force			1
he added : ‘ the critical point is not merely ratification but when the treaty is enforced			0
’ @entity16 ’s bail conditions prevent him from turning mobile phones on in his house			1

’ mr @entity50 said : ‘ it ’s accepted he did not exercise due diligence in relation to the phones and usb sticks			0
probe : police inspected the hate preacher 's @entity49 home as the radical cleric was arrested for allegedly breaching his bail conditions in march mrs may said the deal will ' finally ' make it possible to kick @entity16 out and @entity226 's shadow home secretary @entity225 said the @entity228 's statement ' could be very good news ' ‘ all he would say would be they were not his phones and there is no evidence they were used unlawfully			1
