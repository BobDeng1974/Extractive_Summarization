by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity3 could crack under the pressure of fighting to win his second @entity7 championship , his former rival @entity2 has warned			1
@entity3 has been cast 29 points adrift of his @entity10 team - mate @entity9 ahead of this weekend 's @entity12 @entity11			1
the @entity12 star , who robbed @entity2 of the championship in the most dramatic of circumstances at the season finale in @entity17 six years ago , has been hit with two mechanical retirements this year , while @entity9 has finished either first or second at every race			1
but @entity2 , speaking on the eve of his 200th @entity7 start , believes @entity3 has been outsmarted by his team - mate so far this season			1
' @entity3 is one of the greatest drivers in terms of speed , and he has incredible talent , ' @entity2 told @entity29			1
' i would say @entity9 is losing a little bit , in terms of speed compared to @entity3 , but maybe he is using a bit more of his brain			1
i can handle it ! @entity2 warned that @entity3 could crack under the pressure of chasing the title trailing : the @entity38 is 29 points behind @entity41 team - mate @entity9 heading to @entity42 ' from now until the last race we might see that @entity3 is back to his top form , winning races and starting from pole , but maybe not			1
maybe he is under pressure because he is behind in the championship , so @entity9 can use that to his favour			1
' @entity3 came to within one race of making grand prix history and being crowned champion in his first year in the sport in 2007			2
but he blew a 12 - point lead with just two races remaining , spinning into the gravel on his entrance to the pits and retiring from the penultimate race in @entity62 , before finishing only seventh at the final grand prix in @entity17			2
a year later , @entity3 returned to @entity64 to win the title , but only after he passed the @entity66 of @entity67 on the last corner of the last lap in torrid conditions , to stop @entity2 , who won the race , from claiming the title			1
' when you are at at team where the worst situation is you finish second , a driver who has lost all the points because he did not finish has a big , big impact and that is what has happened with @entity3 , ' added @entity2 in reference to @entity3 's retirements in @entity82 and @entity83			1
no 1 : @entity9 won the @entity84 @entity11 to extend his lead over @entity3 before the @entity12 @entity11 company : @entity3 and @entity87 attend the @entity88 at the @entity89 ' it makes his pressure higher , and his work higher , but he can not be so nervous about it otherwise he could lose even more			1
@entity3 was a driver that maybe lost under the pressure when he was fighting for the championship in 2007 and 2008 , but maybe he has a little bit more experience now			1
i do n't know if that will help or not , but for sure he has more pressure now than @entity9			1
' @entity2 arrives at @entity42 in good form after he stunned the paddock by claiming the first @entity105 pole of the year in @entity84 last month			2
it was his first in almost six years , and comes after he moved to @entity107 over the winter , frustrated by playing second fiddle to @entity110 at @entity111			0
' i am at a team which really respects me 100 per cent and want to do everything they can to make me competitive again - to fight for podiums but also for victories , too , ' he explains			2
' when people spend so long at a place , a change is like a re-start and you feel younger and you need that			0
i needed that and maybe even @entity111 , too			0
so , it was the right change which came at the right time			0
' breaking the streak : @entity2 ( centre ) claimed the first non @entity10 pole of the season in @entity84 close : the @entity17 was disappointed to miss out on the podium and finish fourth in @entity132 @entity2 admitted he was disappointed to finish only fourth after starting from pole , but the @entity17 was fortunate to even be on the grid at the @entity135 following his spectacular 190mph crash with @entity137 in @entity83 a fortnight previously			1
' i was sure it was going to hurt because it was so quick , ' @entity2 said as he recalled the last - lap horror smash which saw both he and @entity137 admitted to hospital			2
' it is the worst feeling you can have knowing that the wall is coming at you so quickly			0
i pulled @entity147 on the crash but thank @entity149 i am here and nothing happened to me			0
' @entity2 , 33 , will be joined by an unfamiliar face on track this weekend , when @entity12 's @entity107 ' development driver @entity154 becomes the first female in more than two decades to participate at a grand prix weekend			1
' i think it is fantastic and great to see a lady driving the car , so i will try to help her in any way i can , ' @entity2 said of @entity154 , who will take to the wheel in friday 's practice session			2
' i hope @entity154 does a good job with the opportunity she has , and it is not just because she is a lady			0
it depends how quick she can be , but what experience , performance and talent she can show to the team			2
' tense : @entity17 face @entity172 in the @entity174 quarter - final on friday back in his native country , @entity17 , who are battling to win the @entity174 in front of an expectant home crowd , face @entity172 in their quarter - final clash on friday			2
' i know how it is to win at home , and fight for the championship at home , so if we can win the @entity174 it will be like a big dream coming true , ' he says			0
' but honestly , i am a sportsman and i know how difficult it is , and it does n't always happen in the perfect way			0
the result might not be what you expect and this is part of sport , but @entity17 do not think like that			0
if you are second then you have lost			0
' that is really tough but it is the mentality			0
i know if we do not win , the media will be very strong and the people , too			0
i do n't enjoy it so much , but that is the way it is			0
' @entity206 is an official partner to @entity107			0
