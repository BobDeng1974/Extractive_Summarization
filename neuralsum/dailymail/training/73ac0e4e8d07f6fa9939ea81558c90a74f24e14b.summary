it 's a country known for it 's relaxed way of life - so much so , that citizens fiercely treasure the siesta tradition of napping during the day			0
and now researchers believe that they have found a reason for @entity8 's sleepy stereotype - the country is in the wrong timezone , forcing its residents to rise an hour earlier than they they should			2
a new parliamentary report blames the fact that @entity8 is stuck in @entity13 - which means running one hour ahead of daylight - for everything from low work productivity to gender gaps			1
the document by a parliamentary commission said that ' @entity8 for more than 71 years has not been in the correct time zone ' the time zone is unusual because the @entity25 country sits in the middle of the @entity27 , the one that @entity29 , @entity30 and @entity31 belong to , the @entity22 reported			1
the report argues that @entity8 ' sleeping patterns are based around the ' artificial ' time zone , but their work hours follow the daylight time			1
so citizens will work until the daylight begins to end , despite going to work an hour earlier , the @entity37 reported			0
the report 's authors recommend that the government move @entity8 's daylight hours to accord with the @entity27 - which could see an improvement in work productivity and stress levels			1
the report argues that @entity8 ' sleeping patterns are based around the ' artificial ' time zone , but their work hours follow the daylight time the document by a parliamentary commission said that ' @entity8 for more than 71 years has not been in the correct time zone ' , the @entity22 reported			1
the reason for the country 's peculiar time zone compared to their neighbours occured in 1942 , the @entity8 dictator @entity51 moved @entity8 onto @entity13 to follow @entity57			1
unlike the @entity31 , which changes its clocks twice a year , @entity8 sticks to one time			2
in the past @entity60 researchers have studied the impact of daylight saving on a person 's health - and discovered that moving the clocks backwards and forwards can wreak havoc on the body			0
in 2012 they found that the abrupt change to a person 's daily schedule increased the risk of having a heart attack by 10 per cent			2
this impact is n't felt on the sunday morning as most people adapt their weekend schedule and rise a little later			0
however , the risk peaks on monday when workers have to get up at a set time to get to the office			2
when the clocks go back in october the risk of heart attack decreases by 10 per cent			0
' exactly why this happens is not known but there are several theories , ' said professor @entity89 at the time			0
' sleep deprivation , the body 's circadian clock and immune responses all can come into play when considering reasons that changing the time by an hour can be detrimental to someone 's health			0
