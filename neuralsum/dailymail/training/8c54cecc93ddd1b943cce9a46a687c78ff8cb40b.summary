white voters of all ages were less likely to back @entity2 this year than in elections past , helping @entity4 nationwide but most acutely in the @entity6 - and overpowering @entity2 efforts to turn out their core supporters among blacks and @entity9			1
in a nation growing ever more diverse , political forecasters repeatedly warn @entity4 they must improve their appeal among minorities in order to remain competitive in the long term			0
but for the @entity2 , dominating the vote among minorities is n't enough to win elections today - and it wo n't be in the future if the @entity4 is able to run up similar margins among whites , who still make up a majority of voters in every state			1
wrong strategy ? it was a mistake for @entity2 to distance themselves from the president , said @entity28 , a former @entity29 campaign adviser and @entity2 strategist ' the rule of thumb was @entity2 could win with 90 per cent of the @entity34 - @entity33 vote and 40 per cent of the white vote , ' said @entity36 , a political science professor at @entity37 in @entity38			1
' but now very few @entity2 could think about getting 40 per cent of the white vote			1
they 're trying to get 30 per cent			0
' in the @entity6 states , from @entity42 to @entity43 , it 's very hard for the @entity2 candidate to get 25 per cent of the white vote			1
' republicans running for seats in the @entity47 won 60 per cent of the white vote , while @entity2 won the backing of 89 per cent of african - americans and 62 per cent of @entity9			1
those margins are nearly identical to the 2010 midterm elections			0
but @entity2 won more of the white and @entity9 vote in 2006 , the last midterm elections in which the party won control of the @entity47			1
white voters last tilted in @entity2 ' favor in a midterm in 1990 , and were a swing group in the 1980s			2
the data on voters come from exit polls of voters nationally and in 27 states that were conducted for @entity65 and the television networks by @entity67			0
polling power : voters wait in line to cast their ballots at the @entity73 campus most interviews were conducted among randomly selected voters at precincts nationwide and in each state			0
outside the @entity6 , whites broke for @entity4 by an average of eight percentage points on tuesday			2
but in ten @entity82 states with an election for @entity84 on the ballot , @entity4 won the white vote by an average of 42 points			1
democrats garnered so little support among whites in @entity91 , @entity43 , @entity92 , @entity42 and @entity93 that a majority of those voting for the @entity2 candidate were non-white			1
in @entity100 , though incumbent @entity2 sen. @entity98 was widely credited with running a solid campaign , she carried just 33 per cent of the white vote - down from 39 per cent in 2008 - and lost			1
white voters under age 30 backed @entity98 by close to a 2 - 1 margin six years ago as they helped sweep president @entity29 into office			2
this time , in a midterm election , the younger white voters who cast ballots in @entity100 broke just as decisively for @entity98 's @entity4 opponent , state house speaker @entity110			0
@entity111 , president of the @entity112 , a @entity2 - leaning consulting firm , said he 's been jokingly calling this election the @entity115 election for @entity2 : they had no national message that resonated with their voters			2
' it was an election about nothing			0
republicans made it an election about president @entity29			2
that was their goal , ' he said			0
' their mission was to turn out people who were angry , people who were displeased with the job the president has done			0
' it was a mistake for @entity2 to distance themselves from the president , said @entity28 , a former @entity29 campaign adviser and @entity2 strategist			1
@entity2 voters are not motivated to help candidates who were happy to be with @entity29 two years ago , but tried to avoid his presence this year , he said			2
' i 'm sure ( it ) led a lot of these voters to say , " how is this candidate going to treat me in two years ? " ' he said			0
the only states in which @entity2 @entity84 candidates improved their overall support among whites were @entity151 , @entity152 and @entity92 , a @entity82 state where @entity154 managed to grow the @entity2 share of the white vote from eight percent in 2008 to 16 per cent			1
@entity2 voters were especially less engaged in states where there were not supposed to be competitive elections , said @entity160 , an associate professor of political science at the @entity162 who tracks voter turnout			1
@entity2 voters are traditionally more likely to stay home if the midterm races are uninspiring , while @entity4 voters - who tend to be older , wealthier and more educated and also are more likely to be white - generally come to the polls anyway , he said			2
' the poster child for this would be @entity170			0
it 's an uncompetitive race , according to all the polls			0
in that environment , who sits out the election ? it 's predominantly @entity2 , ' @entity160 said			0
two days after the election , while the heavily favored incumbent , @entity2 sen. @entity178 , had a lead of a few thousand votes out of more than two million cast , the race remained too close to call .			0

@entity36 , a political science professor at @entity37 in @entity38 , said the party *struggled* to get 25 per cent of the white vote in the @entity6
@entity2 garnered so little support among whites in @entity91 , @entity43 , @entity92 , @entity42 and @entity93 that a majority of those voting for the @entity2 candidate were non-white
it was a mistake for the party to distance itself from the president , said @entity28 , a former @entity29 campaign adviser and @entity2 strategist
