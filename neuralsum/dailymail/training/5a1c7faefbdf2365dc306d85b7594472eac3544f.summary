by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 12:32 est , 16 january 2014 updated : 06:42 est , 20 january 2014 the @entity3 has revealed exactly how it hopes @entity5 probe will land on a comet later this year			1
the craft will perform a breathtaking complex series of moves described as ' a space dance ' to enable it to fly close enough to the surface to identify a landing site			1
it will then release its lander - if it can complete the moves mission controller liken to ' parachuting onto the tip of a mountain			2
’ watch the amazing path the probe will take after a ten year journey through space , @entity3 ’s @entity5 spacecraft will reach comet @entity23 in august 2014			2
after catching up with the comet @entity5 will slightly overtake and enter orbit from the ‘ front ’ of the comet as both the spacecraft and @entity29 move along their orbits around the @entity31 @entity5 will carry out a complex series of manoeuvres to reduce the separation between the spacecraft and comet from around 100 km to 25 - 30 km. from this close orbit , detailed mapping will allow scientists to determine the landing site for the mission ’s @entity42 lander			1
immediately prior to the deployment of @entity42 in november , @entity5 will come to within just 2.5 km of the comet ’s nucleus			1
the comet - chasing probe is set to be woken from its deep space slumber early next week , the @entity3 ( @entity3 ) has said			2
at precisely 10 am gmt on 20 january , the @entity5 spacecraft be brought back to life as it moves closer towards @entity52			1
when @entity55 's @entity5 spacecraft wakes , scientists are hoping it will be ready for the final stage of its daring mission to land on the comet			1
the scientists are in for an nerve - wracking wait as there is little room for mistakes as the coming months			0
after it is woken from its slumber , the spacecraft will be involved a high - speed chase followed by a delicate dance around comet @entity23			0
it will then attempt a historic landing in november 2014 the intercepting a 4km wide comet as it hurtles towards the sun. ‘ imagine trying to parachute onto the tip of a mountain , ’ said @entity74 , head of mission operations at the @entity3 ( @entity3 )			1
the effort is different from @entity81 ’s @entity80 probe that fired a projectile into comet @entity83 in 2005 , hurling a plume of matter into space for scientists to study			0
@entity5 's journey : the probe carried out a series of orbits to slingshot itself towards its target @entity5 was launched in 2004 and has since travelled around the sun five times , picking up energy from @entity96 and @entity97 to line it up with its final destination : @entity99 – @entity100			1
for the coldest , loneliest leg of the mission , as @entity5 travelled out towards the orbit of @entity103 , the spacecraft was put into deep - space hibernation			1
in 2014 , @entity5 will complete its cruise towards the comet , meeting with it in august , before putting its @entity42 lander onto the comet ’s surface in november			1
the time for @entity5 to wake up and prepare for this most exciting scientific adventure is now fast approaching			2
that mission was more of a sniper shot compared to the extended meeting @entity3 is planning for its spacecraft			0
launched in 2004 , @entity5 has already spent almost 10 years in space preparing for its big day			1
the probe had to conduct three fly - bys of @entity96 and one of @entity97 , taking advantage of the planets ' gravity to accelerate sufficiently to intercept comet @entity126 as it orbits the sun at speeds of up to 100,000 kph ( 62,000 mph )			1
the spacecraft has been in hibernation for more than two years now to conserve energy			0
@entity3 has been using the time to solve two glitches that could jeopardise the mission : a problem with two of the four ` reaction wheels ' used to turn the spacecraft , and a small leak of helium that could affect the thrusters which are vital for its final manoeuvres			0
‘ this is making our life more difficult , ’ dr @entity74 acknowledges			0
but he added that engineers have found workarounds			0
if all goes according to plan , the probe 's instruments will slowly switch themselves back on , though scientists will have a tense few hours of waiting before they can be sure the spacecraft is in full working order			0
the following months will involve a gradual approach of @entity157 , as @entity5 gently slows down and eventually draws up alongside the comet in what dr @entity74 likened to two planes flying in formation			2
the spacecraft will be involved a high - speed chase later this year followed by a delicate dance around comet @entity23			0
pictured is an artist 's impression of the comet this will give the mission team time to take plenty of pictures of the comet , which is about 4km ( 2.5 miles ) in diameter , and identify a good landing site			2
at the moment scientists are divided over whether to pick a site close to the comet 's three active regions - where matter appears to be released into space - or to stay away from them to prevent dust from harming the lander 's sensitive instruments			2
the lander - called @entity42 - will drop onto the surface of @entity157 and latch on using a harpoon , to prevent it from drifting off into space due to the comet 's weak gravity			2
using drills , it will dig up samples and analyse them using on - board instruments			0
researchers hope to gain fascinating insights from the results , because comets have remained largely unchanged since the beginning of the universe			0
‘ this time capsule 's been locked away for 4.6 billion years , ’ said @entity3 's director of science @entity203			0
one key question scientists hope the mission can help answer is whether comets are responsible for the water on @entity96 , he said			1
scientists believe the spacecraft 's star trackers are now beginning to warm up , taking around six hours			0
its thrusters will fire to stop the slow rotation			0
a slight adjustment will be made to @entity5 's orientation to ensure that the solar arrays are still facing directly towards the sun for the coldest , loneliest leg of the mission , as @entity5 travelled out towards the orbit of @entity103 , the spacecraft was put into deep - space hibernation			1

@entity5 is expected to release its lander in november
video reveals the *incredibly* complex route it will take to get close to the surface
@entity234 to be brought back to life on january 20 at 10am gmt as landing phase of mission begins
it launched in 2004 and has since travelled around the sun five times
will land on comet @entity99 – @entity100
mission could help answer whether comets brought water to @entity96
