the @entity13 , which runs three hospitals including @entity15 in @entity16 ( pictured ) , is to be broken up although there have been some improvements to services in recent months , waiting times for some operations are among the longest in the country			2
the trust runs @entity24 ’s in @entity25 , @entity15 in @entity16 and the @entity26 in @entity27 , serving more than a million patients			0
