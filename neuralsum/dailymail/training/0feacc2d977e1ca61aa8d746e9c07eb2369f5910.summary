more than 1.3 million people have viewed the tribute to the officers on @entity5			1

' tuesday 's events simply make us spur on to higher and greater efforts , ' mr @entity37 said			0
' i think what we 've seen on tuesday has had to appeal to everyone in terms of a watershed moment			0
' ' i would say the strong message that @entity38 has been using over the last six weeks , and perhaps even further back , is , " enough is enough			0
this has to end "			0
' that 's why we 've been working with individuals with threats to life notices as part of our investigation			0

' mr @entity37 went on : ' i think anybody who perhaps wishes to take the opportunity , following such a tragedy , to tastelessly add derogatory comments , to perhaps think that they 're poking fun at such a tragic situation , will always cause a great deal of emotion			0
' i think police officers - not just police officers , ordinary members of the public - and i looked at some of these websites and saw ordinary members of the public alarmed and really distressed at some of the ridiculous comments that have been put on there			2
' i think they would have wanted us to take positive action and that 's exactly what ourselves and @entity43 have done			2
