an anti-shake spoon is allowing people with frustrating and disabling tremors enjoy their favourite foods once more			1
the @entity5 spoon detects and then cancels out shakes and judders , allowing soup , cereal and other hard to manipulate foods be eaten with ease			1
the technology , which has been bought by @entity13 , is aimed at @entity15 ’s patients and other people with tremors			1
but it can also occur in otherwise healthy people , with four in 100 adults aged 40 - plus suffering from an essential tremor that when severe can make eating , drinking and writing extremely difficult			0
cutting - edge electronics hidden in chunky handle of the @entity5 spoon sense the tremor			1
they then move the handle in the opposite direction , to cancel out the shake			2
similar technology is used in cameras to compensate for unsteady hands			0
the spoon ’s creators , at @entity45 - based @entity44 , say that it puts the dignity and enjoyment back into mealtimes			1
and that in trials , it cut tremors by more than 70 per cent			2
a spokesman said : ‘ @entity55 brings people together			0
it is more than a time for nourishing the body , we nourish our spirit and relationships			0
‘ a tremor , whether from essential tremor or parkinson ’s disease takes away from this experience , forcing people to focus instead on the basic task of eating			0
‘ we ’ve invented the @entity5 spoon to cancel hand tremor and take the frustration out of eating			1
‘ we are proud to offer a product that allows people to take charge of their tremor			0
’ at £ 180 the electronic spoon is n’t cheap – however , it does come with a 30 - day money back guarantee			1
while @entity44 is marketing the spoon at @entity15 's sufferers , charity @entity78 say that people with the disease suffer tremors when their hand is at rest , meaning the spoon may not be useful one customer told how the spoon allowed them to eat a bowl of cereal for the first time in years			1
another told how they have eaten ‘ multiple bowls ’ of soup and cereal without spilling a drop			2
@entity98 and key holder attachments are also planned for the handle , which is comes with an electric toothbrush - like charger			0
announcing its purchase of @entity44 , @entity13 said the technology ‘ could improve quality of life for millions of people ’			1
@entity13 is increasingly investing in health technology			2
its co-founder @entity109 has a personal interest in @entity15 ’s			0
his mother has the disease and he carries a gene that raises his odds of developing it			0
however , @entity78 has questioned how useful the spoon will be for the 127,000 @entity117 with the disease			0
@entity119 , the charity ’s head of education , said : ‘ the majority of people with @entity15 ’s only have a tremor when their hand is resting and so this technology wo n’t help them			2
