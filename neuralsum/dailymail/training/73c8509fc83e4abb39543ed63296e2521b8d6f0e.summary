is there another fixture in the football calendar that encapsulates the two ends of the @entity5 spectrum better than @entity6 versus @entity7 ? @entity9 chic meets old @entity11 grit			1
this time last year , @entity6 were playing @entity13 at a half - empty @entity14			1
@entity16 ’s team were among the favourites for relegation from the @entity19 and their supporters could never have dreamed what lay ahead			0
on monday night , the old place will be packed to the rafters in front of a global television audience for the visit of @entity28 ’s multi-millionaires			0
the stands literally shook when @entity47 hammered home the winner that night , and it will be no different if @entity16 ’s team pull off another shock against @entity7			1
on paper , the chances of that look slim but this is the @entity5 after all			2
the difference in value between the two probable starting line - ups is quite staggering ; more than £ 200million spent by @entity7 compared to the £ 5m it has cost to assemble this @entity6 team ; a multi-national side made up of @entity63 and @entity65 winners against a bunch of free signings , @entity5 journeymen and cast - offs from the big clubs brought together by the inspirational @entity16 ; @entity28 against the man they call the @entity73			1
no wonder @entity16 ’s players have been seeing a sports psychologist to prepare them for the mental battle of staying up			0
@entity28 : @entity28 will know that he has to deliver this season after a trophy-less campaign last time out @entity73 : whilst @entity16 has already surpassed expectations by reaching the @entity5 @entity6 - £ 5.080m @entity80 ( free ) ; @entity81 ( £ 450,000 ) , @entity82 ( £ 1.1m ) , @entity35 ( £ 30,000 ) , @entity83 ( £ 600,000 ) ; @entity84 ( free ) , @entity85 ( £ 500,000 ) , @entity86 ( free ) , @entity87 ( free ) ; @entity39 ( £ 900,000 ) , @entity88 ( £ 1.5m )			1
@entity7 - £ 206.6m @entity89 ( £ 7.8m ) ; @entity90 ( £ 9m ) , @entity91 ( £ 7m ) , @entity92 ( academy ) , @entity94 ( £ 16m ) ; @entity95 ( £ 21m ) , @entity96 ( £ 19.8m ) ; @entity97 ( £ 32m ) , @entity98 ( £ 30m ) , @entity99 ( £ 32m ) ; @entity32 ( £ 32m )			1
a few of them have extensive @entity5 experience such as @entity86 , @entity85 , @entity87 and new signing @entity103			2
others have played briefly in the top - flight but some will never have come up against the type of opposition they face on monday			2
nothing sums up the gulf in resources better than the contest between @entity6 ’s veteran defender @entity35 and @entity7 ’s new signing @entity32			1
@entity35 , 36 , has played in all top six tiers of @entity117 football and is celebrating 10 years at @entity14 after joining the @entity6 in 2004 from @entity118 for £ 30,000			1
@entity7 paid 1,067 times more than that to buy @entity32 , 25 , from @entity121 for £ 32m following his appearance for @entity123 at the @entity63			1
@entity28 also brought in @entity98 and @entity94 as part of a £ 78m summer transfer spend , while @entity16 ’s biggest extravagance was the £ 1.5m he paid @entity127 for striker @entity88			2
big finish : @entity47 scores the winner against @entity43 on @entity6 's return to the top flight five years ago rocking and rolling : he celebrates securing the famous victory in front of a packed house at @entity14 age : 25			1
position : striker signed : from @entity121 , 2014 , £ 32m salary : £ 180,000 a week clubs : @entity140 , @entity142 ( loan ) , @entity121 , @entity140 ( loan ) , @entity145 ( loan ) , @entity147 ( loan ) , @entity148 , @entity121 , @entity149 ( loan ) , @entity7 international caps : 2 for @entity152 , 4 for @entity123 age : 36 position : centre half salary : £ 10,000 a week ( approx ) signed : from @entity118 , 2004 , £ 30,000 clubs : @entity118 , @entity158 ( loan ) , @entity6 international caps : 24 for @entity160 @entity6 captain @entity82 , who will partner @entity35 in central defence against @entity32 , has no doubt the veteran @entity164 is up to the challenge			1
‘ @entity168 encapsulates everything about the team , ’ said @entity82 , who also had a brief spell in the @entity5 with @entity167			2
‘ he ’s really worked his way up and he deserves his opportunity			0
‘ we had the best defensive record last year and that ’s an incredible achievement , especially in your mid- 30s			0
there ’s no reason why it should stop now			0
he ’s fitter than some players i ’ve seen who are 10 years his junior			0
i have every confidence he ’s going to do great			0
‘ @entity32 is obviously a fantastic player			2
for @entity7 to spend that kind of money on him he ’s got to be a great player , and i ’m sure he ’ll light up the @entity5 at some stage this year			1
‘ we ’re really looking forward to testing ourselves against him			0
you have to step up in all areas of your game			0
we ’re playing against some of the best players and i think the biggest thing for me when i played in there previously was if you make a mistake you ’re going to get punished			0
pricey : @entity98 has been another expensive arrival for @entity7 this summer frugal : whilst goalkeeper @entity198 is one of a number of players to arrive on a free at @entity201 ‘ but it ’s the same as last year and we were underdogs then			2
it brings a certain freedom and freedom can be a powerful thing			0
with the pressure off there ’s no weight on our shoulders			0
we can go out there and give everything and see what happens			0
’ @entity35 is the only survivor from the last @entity6 side to play @entity7 at @entity14 in january 2010			1
@entity92 ’s 82nd - minute header proved decisive in a 2 - 1 win that day , and @entity92 , @entity217 , @entity90 and @entity95 ( who played in his first spell at @entity219 ) will be back on monday night			2
nothing much has changed in the meantime			0
@entity7 are still among the leading title contenders and @entity6 are still favourites for relegation – but the @entity5 can still throw up a big surprise .			1

@entity6 vs @entity7 encapsulates two ends of the @entity5 spectrum
@entity7 's £ 200m worth of talent set to take on £ 5m *minnows* @entity6
@entity47 scored as the @entity6 beat @entity43 1 - 0 on their last return at home to the @entity5 in 2009
@entity35 , who cost £ 30,000 set to mark £ *32million* man @entity32
