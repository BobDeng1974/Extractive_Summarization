perilous : @entity1 leaving @entity2 in @entity3 today @entity1 issued a love letter to @entity6 activists last night as @entity7 closed to within two points in the opinion polls			1
the peace offering followed revelations that a senior ally of the prime minister had branded the party faithful ‘ swivel - eyed loons ’			1
@entity16 warn that his leadership is in peril amid discontent on @entity21 and gay marriage			0
the scale of the crisis was shown last night by a new poll that puts the @entity26 down five points on just 24 per cent , 11 behind @entity28			0
@entity7 – up six points in a month – was on 22 per cent , double the level of @entity31 his email to party members , mr @entity1 said : ‘ we have been together through good times and bad			1
this is more than a working relationship ; it is a deep and lasting friendship			0
’ referring to reports that @entity6 co-chairman @entity39 – a tennis partner of mr @entity1 – had insulted them , he added : ‘ i am proud to lead this party			1
i am proud of what you do			0
and i would never have around me those who sneered or thought otherwise			0
‘ we are a team , from the parish council to the local association to @entity46 , and i never forget it			1
’ the dire poll ratings will fuel the discontent of @entity6 mps who warned yesterday the number prepared to force a leadership election has risen in recent days			1
if 46 write letters to @entity56 , chairman of the backbench @entity57 , there would be a vote of no confidence in mr @entity1			1
a senior mp said : ‘ three or four weeks ago it felt like we had turned a corner			0
now it feels like the wheels are coming off pretty fast			0
’ a plotter said : ‘ by my reckoning between 18 and 23 letters could go in overnight			2
@entity1 is by no means out of the woods and wo n’t be for the next two years			2
’ insult : lord @entity39 , chairman of the @entity6 and personal friend of @entity1 , has denied calling @entity6 activists ' swivel - eyed loons ' @entity16 warn that a by - election loss to @entity7 would lead to ‘ meltdown ’ in the party			1
the @entity6 board discussed the @entity39 issue for 35 minutes yesterday and rejected calls from @entity6 mp and board member @entity80 to hold a full investigation			2
lord @entity39 repeated his denial that he said the words attributed to him			0
that section of the meeting was chaired by co-chairman @entity86 with @entity39 still in the room			0
capitalising : @entity7 leader @entity88 can celebrate that his party is twice as popular as the @entity90 both faced criticism over the ‘ disconnect ’ between the leadership and the grassroots , over the way the affair was handled and over no 10 ’s decision to attack the media for its reporting			1
mr @entity86 admitted @entity6 high command must do more to connect with party members , stressing party chiefs would ‘ redouble its efforts ’			1
after the meeting , mr @entity80 said : ‘ it was agreed that there was a need to narrow the gap between the party and the country and the leadership			2
’ but he also suggested that mr @entity1 still ought to do more to get to the bottom of the ‘ @entity114 ’ incident			1
‘ if it were my company , i would want to find out exactly what had happened because i would want to put it right and make sure it did n’t happen for the next time , ’ he said			2
@entity120 , chairman of @entity121 , said : ‘ i find it absolutely astonishing that this insult to the @entity6 is n’t being investigated			1
‘ if an investigation conclusively revealed the attributed comments were not made by a senior party member it would set minds at rest			2
‘ to dismiss any investigation smacks of arrogance and cover - up			2
this seems to confirm the leadership ’s contempt for its grassroots			0
’ those present at the meeting said the party board – a group of mps , peers , donors and local party bosses – backed @entity39 because he works assiduously for the party			0
but some privately expressed concerns the co-chairman was simply expressing the views of mr @entity1			0
one of them said : ‘ the @entity150 story plays into the wider sense in the party and the country that there is an aching void between most of the @entity157 people and a small group of gilded elite who do n’t understand them			0

@entity1 e-mailed party members to *re-affirm* ' we are a team '
peace offering comes in wake of *alleged* ‘ swivel - eyed loons ’ comment
