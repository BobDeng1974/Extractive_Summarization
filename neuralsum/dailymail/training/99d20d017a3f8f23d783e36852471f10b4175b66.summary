warm @entity16 breezes blowing in from the @entity17 could push temperatures to 21c ( 70f ) in places			1

but do n’t get too used to the good weather – last year ’s warm spring was followed by a washout summer			1
@entity72 forecaster @entity71 said : ‘ we are set for a lovely weekend , with temperatures reaching 17 - 18c and even 21c in some places			1
there will be plenty of sunshine around			1
‘ this is down to an area of high pressure to the east of us bringing in warm air from @entity85 and the @entity16			1
‘ sunday will start off a bit grey and misty but we ’ll find that clearing away and bringing in warm sunshine again			2
’ miss @entity71 added that the unseasonal weather would continue for a while at least – although parts of @entity91 and the south - east could miss out			2
@entity92 trap : residents in @entity37 catch rays on the beach at the city 's historic hot walls , a rare day out for this time of year chilling out : the mercury is expected to remain at similar levels throughout the weekend and into next week , although some parts of the @entity4 , particularly east @entity102 , may have it spoiled by cloud do n't forget the suncream ! residents in @entity37 get into the spirit of summer months early idyllic : horse riders enjoy the spring sunshine in @entity109 , left , as boaters enjoy themselves on the @entity111 in @entity112 , right ‘ we are expecting the warm weather to carry on into the weekend and next week , ’ she said			1
‘ we may well see a change towards the end of next week with things becoming cooler , but it is quite a long way out for us to say for definite that this will be the case			2
’ friday was the warmest day of the year so far with a temperature of 20.6c ( 69f ) in @entity120 , @entity121			2
but although the temperatures are unseasonal , they wo n’t make the record books			1
the hottest march day was 25.6c ( 78f ) at @entity125 in @entity126 on march 29 , 1968			2
the dry conditions spell further difficulties for water companies , which fear a prolonged drought and have already warned of hosepipe bans			2
the @entity132 said : ‘ it ’s been the driest march since records began in 1910 and it ’s not looking likely that we ’ll have enough rain to avoid a widespread drought this summer			2
‘ we ’re working with farmers to keep them going through the summer and we have new regulations to produce environmental sites like wetlands			0
it ’s our job to make sure everybody gets water and the environment is protected			0
it ’s been a very , very dry week and river levels are continuing to decrease			0
‘ obviously , it ’s nice to have a sunny weekend but what we really need at the moment is a prolonged period of rainfall			0
‘ on hot weekends , we should all try to use less water			0
if we all can use a little less , we can make the most of what we have			0
