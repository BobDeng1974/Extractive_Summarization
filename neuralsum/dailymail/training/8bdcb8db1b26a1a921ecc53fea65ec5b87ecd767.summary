president @entity0 is challenging major cable and telephone companies to expand broadband access by encouraging the @entity4 to pre-empt state laws that stifle competition for high - speed internet service			1
@entity0 wants to expand access to broadband communications services , siding with local communities that want either to expand competition or provide municipal services themselves			2
to promote it , he used a @entity15 , @entity16 , speech today to announce that his administration will provide technical and financial assistance to towns and cities that want to improve internet service for their residents			2
' today high speed broadband is not a luxury			2
this is n't just about making it easier to stream @entity31 or scroll through your @entity33 news feed , ' he said			0
' this is about helping local businesses grow and prosper and compete in a global economy			0
' it 's about giving the entrepreneur , the small business person on main street , chance to compete with the folks out in silicon valley or across the globe			0
@entity0 detailed broadband plans this afternoon in @entity49 , a community that has taken steps to provide high - speed internet to its roughly 40,000 residents			1
roughly 20 years ago @entity49 created a community broadband network			0
in 2010 it began a two - year process to upgrade to a full fiber network			0
' basically , you guys were like the captain in @entity73 ... ' we 're gon na need a bigger boat , ' he said , using a variation of the film 's famous quote			0
the administration 's stance will put it at odds with major cable and telephone companies such as @entity84 , @entity85 and @entity86 , that currently provide internet service , often with little or no competition			1
@entity0 has already angered the industry by calling for new @entity4 rules that treat @entity92 service providers as public utilities			2
in a @entity48 video before the announcement , @entity0 says : ' you know what it feels like when you do n't have a good internet connection			2
everything is buffering , you try to download a video and you 've got that little circle thing that goes round and round , it 's really aggravating			0
' but there are also ' real world consequences to this and it makes us less economically competitive , ' @entity0 says , explaining that businesses are more likely to set up shop in towns where broadband internet is easy to access			2
@entity117 , director of @entity0 's @entity118 , said @entity0 wants to use the bully pulpit of the presidency to press the @entity4 , an independent regulatory agency , to ' ensure that all states have a playing field that allows for a vibrant and competitive market for communication services			2
' nineteen states place restrictions on municipal broadband networks , many with laws encouraged by cable and telephone companies			1
@entity0 referred to the laws today as ' old ' and put consumers at the ' whim ' of their providers			0
@entity0 estimated that 45 million @entity136 are unable to purchase next generation broadband internet that creates connections that he said are six or seven times faster that ' today 's basic speeds			1
' advocates of those laws say they are designed to protect taxpayers from municipal projects that are expensive , can fail or may be unnecessary			0
the @entity145 and the @entity146 have urged the @entity4 not to pre-empt state laws on broadband			1
and @entity149 sen. @entity149 of @entity150 said the proposal amounts to the federal government attempting ' to wield greater power and control			0
' ' this afternoon , we will see the president parachute into @entity16 and tout a new federal takeover of state laws governing broadband and the @entity92 , ' @entity149 said			1
' these @entity161 - centric solutions set a dangerous precedent and have real impacts on local communities and businesses			0
' this graph , distributed by the @entity48 , shows the internet speeds of populous @entity136 cities compared to their global counterparts and @entity136 communities that have invested in broadband infrastructure the @entity4 is already considering requests for @entity173 , @entity174 , and @entity175 , @entity176 , to prevent state laws from blocking the expansion of their broadband projects			1
@entity4 chairman @entity181 said in june that local communities that want to provide their own broadband service ' should n't be stopped by state laws promoted by cable and telephone companies that do n't want that competition			1
' a new @entity48 report says that while 94 percent of @entity136 living in urban areas can purchase an internet connection of 25 megabits per second			1
' but that number does n't look quite as good when you look at the speeds we 're gon na need for all the apps and all the videos and data , new software that is constantly coming on the market , ' @entity0 said today			0
' we got ta keep pace			0
we got ta be up to speed			0
' the @entity48 says only 51 percent of @entity136 in rural areas have access to what @entity0 described as ' super fast ' internet speeds			1
according to its report , three out of four @entity136 lack a choice for such internet service because of lack of competition			1
but many rural @entity136 also lack access to high - speed internet because of the costs associated with constructing the infrastructure necessary to transmit broadband			1
the @entity48 has announced that the @entity218 would promote faster broadband connections by hosting regional workshops and offering technical assistance to communities interested in creating their own network			0
the @entity224 will provide grants and loans of $ 40 million to $ 50 million to assist them			1
a council comprising more than a dozen government agencies will also seek to remove regulatory and policy barriers that hinder broadband competition , the @entity48 said .			2
