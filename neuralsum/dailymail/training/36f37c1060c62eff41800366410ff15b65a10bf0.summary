convicted rapist @entity8 , dubbed ' the @entity9 ' has been allowed to stay at home before his trial he is accused of killing his wife , @entity18 ( pictured ) and her two sisters and then eating their bodies the introduction of electronic tags in @entity22 means people awaiting trial can now argue they deserve the right to stay at home if their case has been dragging on			1
but the country can not afford the electronic tags and so police have no means to ensure @entity8 keeps to his curfew			1
instead police have to make occasional trips to his home in @entity35 , a city in north - eastern @entity36 , to make sure he is in			2
the 60 - year - old suspected cannibal was arrested in april over allegations he killed his 18 - year - old wife , @entity18 and her two sisters @entity42 and @entity43			1
detectives investigating the case have confirmed that human bones had been discovered in his backyard , yet they have not managed to launch a case against him			1
they have even said there was evidence some of the remains had been cooked and eaten			1
a court was forced to release him because the bungled police investigation has already taken such a long time @entity8 married @entity18 after his second wife died of a heart attack in 1993			1
her parents allege that @entity8 also had an affair with their youngest daughter , @entity42 , 18 , who disappeared in 1995			2
the mother of the three girls , @entity64 , said : ' i saw her for the last time when she got into @entity8 's van , and never saw her again after that			2
' despite their suspicions , nothing happened and they say police ignored their missing person report			0
her body was never found , and @entity8 remained with @entity18			2
but in 1999 , it was alleged he started an affair with his wife 's other sister , 13 - year - old @entity81			1
he impregnated her and she gave birth to a boy			0
he admits to the relationship but claims he was taken advantage of			0

@entity8 was arrested in april after being accused of killing his wife and her sisters and then eating the bodies but despite all the suspicious circumstances , the lack of a body meant the investigation over his involvement only started in april			1
a @entity36 police insider said : ' we made a big mistake on this one , despite all the evidence it took far too long for it to be put together , and it was only when a special team was put together to investigate it that we had him			1
