the owners of a @entity2 attraction were left scratching their heads after one of their reindeers shed her antlers hours before visitors were due to arrive			1
blitzen the reindeer was settled into her new temporary @entity2 quarters on sunday night ahead of the grand opening of a seasonal festival			0
but as she was about to welcome families the following morning , her owner opened the doors to her closure and found the animal was missing her trademark antlers			0
blitzen the reindeer shocked owners of @entity21 in @entity22 , @entity23 by shedding her antlers the day before visitors were due to arrive the animals shed their antlers annually , usually in the spring , and owners of the farm did not expect the phenomenon to happen before @entity2 @entity31 , who works at @entity21 in @entity22 , @entity23 , said : ' we 've had so many visitors since we opened on monday and people are really shocked to see a reindeer without antlers			1
' i think a lot of people do n't realise that reindeers shed their antlers so they all seem amazed			1
' we 've assured the children that it wo n't stop her flying on christmas eve so they do n't seem to mind			0
' normally , reindeers shed their antlers in early spring so it 's really unusual to see it this early			1
i wonder whether it 's because the weather has been really mild and she 's got a bit confused			2
