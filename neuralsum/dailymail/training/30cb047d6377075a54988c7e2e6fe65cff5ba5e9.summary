by @entity0 @entity1 : 09:56 est , 18 december 2013 @entity2 : 13:58 est , 18 december 2013 a haunting new short film starring @entity4 portrays the horrors of bulimia , but some say the depiction is somewhat too accurate			2
directed by @entity9 with the help of his 19 - year - old daughter @entity11 , who was anorexic in her early teens , the likeness stars @entity4 as a girl troubled by body image issues as she tries to physically tear her own skin off in self - disgust			1
but while some claim the film truthfully captures the psychological agony of an eating disorder , others warn that it is more harmful than helpful for those who actually struggle with disordered eating			2
true life : directed by @entity9 and his daughter @entity11 , 19 , the likeness stars @entity4 as a girl with body image issues who tries to physically tear her own skin off in self - disgust reflection : suddenly , her face turns into disjointed patches of peeling skin , a horrifying scene that is meant to symbolize the bulimic 's distorted self - perception @entity40 , president of the @entity41 , told @entity42 : ' the whole feeling of feeling worthless , and ugly - i think it portrays that incredibly well			1
' she added , however , that the disturbing footage may act as a trigger to someone still struggling with an eating disorder or body image issues			2
' i definitely would say if someone is in the midst of dealing with an eating disorder , it 's triggering , ' she said			0
' you ’d have to be in a somewhat stable place to confront this emotion			0
' the eight - minute video begins with a tour of a dark house filled with emaciated models and dazed - looking revelers , none of whom look at the camera as it pans by them			2
mr @entity9 says that he originally wanted the models to stare at the camera , but he was dissuaded by his daughter			1
' @entity11 told me no , no , no , the worst feeling is when everybody ignores you , ' he explained			1
' that 's why nobody is looking at the camera ; everybody is doing their own thing			0
' scary : the eight - minute video begins with a tour of a dark house filled with emaciated models and dazed - looking revelers who all ignore the camera as it pans by them unaware : ' @entity11 told me ... the worst feeling is when everybody ignores you , ' he explained			1
' that 's why nobody is looking at the camera ; everybody is doing their own thing ' risk : @entity11 , who was anorexic in her teens , said : ' i definitely would say if someone is in the midst of dealing with an eating disorder , it 's triggering			1
you ¿ d have to be in a somewhat stable place to confront this emotion ' the images become more and more disturbing - like a stick - thin woman striking a pose from behind a plastic sheet , and a sickly man stretched out on a table , his ribs protruding			2
finally , the film shows @entity4 standing in a bathroom , staring despondently at her own reflection in the mirror as she puts on mascara			0
suddenly , her face turns into disjointed patches of peeling skin , a horrifying scene that is meant to symbolize the bulimic 's distorted self - perception , says mr @entity9			1
' what i wanted to do is represent what she 's feeling and what 's in her mind , ' he said			0
the film becomes particularly difficult to watch when the character attempts to physically rip off her own skin , screaming at the mirror in agony			0
she then turns to the toilet and begins vomiting in it , before going back into the party and feigning normalcy to her friends			0
mindset : @entity139 stands in a bathroom , staring blankly at her own reflection in the mirror as she puts on mascara disturbing : the film becomes particularly difficult to watch when the character attempts to physically rip off her own skin , screaming at the mirror in agony and self - hatred talking point : ' we are hoping it helps other people or families to open up and talk about what they 've been feeling or experienced , ' said mr @entity9 a representative at @entity156 told @entity157 : ' @entity4 's character , as she bemoans her own distorted reflection , accurately depicts the way in which someone with body dysmorphia may feel , to see horrifying flaws that truly are not there			1
' she added , however , that the ' grotesque and harsh ' imagery could have a negative effect on people who struggle with disordered eating			0
' what i wanted to do is represent what she 's feeling and what 's in her mind ' ' as someone who battled an eating disorder , we know the horror all too well and watching someone else go through it can be triggering and overwhelming if not in a good mental place , ' she said			0
while mr @entity9 and his daughter acknowledge that the film is disturbing , they also consider it necessary , even therapeutic , for a family that has dealt with eating disorders			1
' i think it 's important to face those triggering things , once you 've , you know , recovered , because you ca n't spend the rest of your life running away , ' said @entity11			1
her father added : ' we are hoping it helps other people or families to open up and talk about what they 've been feeling or experienced			0
also about these feelings that we all have , of feeling judged and isolated and alone in this society			0
