there is always a group of children waiting to hand the @entity3 the customary posy of flowers when she walks out of morning service			2
but yesterday prince @entity7 was also given his own treat when the couple emerged from a church in @entity11 , @entity12			1
as @entity3 smiled as she looked on , the @entity7 appeared equally delighted to receive a bag of sweets from a young well - wisher outside the church in the heart of the @entity18			1
sweet treat : prince @entity7 was given a bag of @entity22 chocolate éclairs by a young girl , left , after attending a church service in @entity11 , @entity12 inedible gifts : as has become tradition , the @entity3 accepted bouquets of flowers from waiting children the sweets - an 89p bag of own - brand chocolate éclairs from @entity22 - were later spotted on the @entity7 's lap as he was driven away			1
parents crowded round with camera phones to capture the moment as their sons and daughters bravely stepped forward to meet the monarch - while some hung shyly back			0
the bouquets are often tactfully placed in a separate car by one of the @entity3 's security team			2
but the éclairs seemed to find a special place in the @entity7 's heart , and was spotted still on his lap as the @entity50 car pulled away			0
the royal pair had attended a service at the @entity53 and @entity54 , which is on the @entity18 estate			0
happy and glorious : the @entity3 beamed as excited parents and children crowded round in the sunshine spectators : during the service , the @entity3 and @entity7 saw a @entity63 play performed by @entity65 children according to local media , the @entity3 and @entity7 had just enjoyed a performance of a @entity63 play - @entity69 - performed by children at the church 's @entity65			1
the monarch often accepts flowers after morning service when she is staying at @entity18 , although in recent weeks the practice has become a little haphazard			0
last week the @entity3 dashed straight to her waiting car because of heavy rain , following successive sundays in which she has accepted bouquets of flowers			2
she had refused to accept flowers from children for two sundays over @entity84 and @entity85 , reportedly because she had to collect so many on christmas day she was late for lunch .			0

@entity3 and @entity7 visited a church in @entity11 , @entity12
her *majesty* was met by children who gave traditional gift of bouquets
but @entity7 got his own treat as a young girl gave him own - brand sweets
