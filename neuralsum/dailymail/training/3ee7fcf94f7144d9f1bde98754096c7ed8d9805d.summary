by @entity0 in @entity1 and @entity2 published : 22:07 est , 26 march 2013 updated : 00:54 est , 27 march 2013 the dramatic announcement that @entity5 ’s top criminal court seeks to retry @entity7 @entity6 for the murder of her @entity10 roommate sparks a heated legal debate that raises questions of double jeopardy			1
the @entity7 constitution bans double jeopardy , or being tried twice for the same crime ; however , @entity5 ’s courts have no such law , meaning that they will use the same evidence to try the 25 - year - old for the 2007 murder of @entity21			1
legal experts say @entity5 ’s @entity24 decision could throw both countries into uncharted territory , as it is highly unlikely the @entity7 will extradite @entity27 to face trial			1
extradited ? @entity6 , pictured in 2011 at @entity29 , is unlikely to ever return to @entity5 after the country 's top court ordered a retrial in the murder of @entity21 statement : @entity27 , pictured in @entity5 court in 2011 , released a statement saying she and her family would remain ' confident in the truth and with our heads held high in the face of wrongful accusations and unreasonable adversity ' overturned : @entity5 's @entity45 , in @entity1 , overturned its original ruling and is seeking a retrial ; the @entity7 @entity48 bans double jeopardy , or a second trial for the same crime @entity27 ’s @entity5 lawyer , @entity52 , said it was unlikely that his client does not intend to return to @entity5 to face trial , which would likely take place this year or next			1
however , @entity27 can be tried in absentia			1
‘ @entity6 does not intend to come back for the retrial , ' he said			0
' her home is in @entity60 and she does n’t need to be here			0
’ he added that the decision to order a new trial was shocking			0
‘ she thought that the nightmare was over , ’ he said on the steps of the courthouse			0
‘ but she ’s ready to fight			0
’ when the @entity5 courts reach a final decision they can also ask for her extradition , the lawyer told @entity71			2
at that point , the @entity7 @entity72 would have to weigh in on the request and make its own decision			2
the state department would then turn to the @entity77 to seek the @entity60 resident ’s extradition			0
a @entity72 official told @entity81 that the matter is currently in the jurisdiction of the @entity5 courts			2
' as such , ' the spokesperson said , ' the @entity72 will refrain from making any further comment			0

right , her sister before her 2007 death regardless of the outcome , the new trial will prove to be an expensive and emotionally - charged spectacle			0
after the court ’s decision , the attractive brunette struck back			0
‘ no matter what happens , my family and i will face this continuing legal battle as we always have , confident in the truth and with our heads held high in the face of wrongful accusations and unreasonable adversity , ’ she said in a statement			0

her memoir , ‘ waiting to be heard , ’ is due out in april			0
@entity21 , 21 , a @entity128 student , was found semi-naked with her throat cut in the bedroom of the house she shared with @entity27 , in @entity133 in november 2007			1
the first trial caused a stir as both @entity27 and @entity136 were acquitted of @entity94 ’s murder , and a polarizing divide in national thought – @entity7 largely understood the two to be innocent , while the @entity10 believed them to be getting away with murder			1
the initial trial also put @entity27 ’s character in the forefront as prosecutors painted the brunette @entity7 student as a sexual deviant who experimented with marijuana			1
but in 2011 , the evidence was re-visited and much of it was found to be ‘ contaminated			2
’ @entity21 's sister @entity94 and mother @entity152 welcomed the news about the retrial on tuesday jailed : @entity27 , 25 , and @entity155 , 29 , spent four years in jail , but were freed on appeal in 2011 largely on the grounds @entity159 evidence was flawed @entity27 and @entity155 spoke on the phone soon after yesterday ’s verdict			1

her throat had been slit and her semi-naked body had been covered with a duvet			0
after a lengthy trial in @entity133 , @entity27 and @entity155 were convicted of the murder in december 2009 and sentenced to 26 and 25 years respectively			1
but two years later , the pair were freed after an appeal court found that the case had been botched and dna evidence contaminated			2
a third suspect , @entity21 , whose dna and bloody footprints were found all over the crime scene , is serving a 16 - year prison sentence , reduced from 30 years on appeal			1
@entity21 ’s family welcomed yesterday ’s judgment			2
her sister @entity94 said : ‘ we are never going to be happy about any outcome because we have still lost @entity21 but we obviously support the decision and hope to get answers from it			2
there are still so many unanswered questions			0
all we have ever wanted to do is do what we can for @entity21 and to find out the truth of what happened that night			2
’ @entity27 had rejoiced after her conviction was sensationally overturned in 2011			1
she fled @entity5 within hours , returning home to the @entity7 , where she quickly embraced life as a free woman			1

@entity155 ’s lawyer @entity222 said : ‘ we are still strong			0
this is not a sentence in itself : this is just an annulment			0
’ @entity27 ’s appeal against her conviction for slander – for having falsely accused her boss @entity21 of the murder – was rejected			1
she has already served the three - year prison sentence for that conviction , but was ordered to pay @entity245 € 4,000 ( $ 5,100 ) in costs			1
the retrial will be held in @entity248 , with different judges , to avoid accusations of prejudice against the accused pair			0
