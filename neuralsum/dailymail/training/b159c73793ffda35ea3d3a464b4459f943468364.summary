join @entity5 's @entity2 campaign by parading the logo at matches ... you could also win an @entity7 shirt signed by @entity8 , @entity9 and @entity10 by tweeting your support former @entity13 striker @entity12 accepts he was no shrinking violet but says that referees have gone too long without punishing the ' dark arts ' used by defenders inside the penalty area to stop strikers at free - kicks and corners			1
now 37 and still playing for @entity23 @entity22 , @entity12 reveals he received a litany of black eyes , sore ribs , stamped - on toes and even scratch - marks down the neck during a career in which he has been regularly blocked off by as many as three defenders at a time at set - pieces			2
he thinks if the laws of the game had been applied correctly , he would have won at least an extra 50 penalties during his eventful career			2
@entity12 admits he is torn by the issue of penalty - area grappling			1
on the one hand , he thinks the physicality of @entity41 football is what makes it special ; on the other , he realises it is getting to the stage now where honest forwards like himself face an impossible job without more protection from officials , and campaigns like @entity5 's ' @entity51 '			1
@entity12 ( left ) is pulled down by @entity53 's @entity52 and this time is awarded a penalty @entity12 ( left ) battles for the ball with @entity58 of @entity59 , who has his arm wrapped around the striker @entity12 ( left ) is climbed over by @entity63 's @entity62 and ( right ) in a grappling contest with @entity65 ' the defender 's job is to stop you scoring and they will cross the boundaries if allowed to			1
there is a dark art to how they do it , ' says @entity12 , who regularly topped the @entity77 charts for both fouls earned and fouls conceded			1
@entity81 defender @entity80 has become the first defender to back out campaign this came after @entity86 manager @entity85 also voiced his support ' i 've lost count the number of times i 've had one defender in front of me , another one behind , and a third one at the side , using his elbows			2
some of them do n't even have any intention of going for the ball – their only purpose is to stop you getting a couple of yards for a run on goal			1
it should n't be allowed when the defender is holding you and not even looking at the ball			1
' i was always having my shirt pulled			1
people have their opinion on me but if i am holding my ground and people are all over me , it is still a foul even if i refuse to go down			1
it would be given as a foul on the halfway line so it should be the same in the penalty area			2
' i 'd probably be able to find at least 50 occasions where i deserved a penalty but did n't get one			0
i 've spoken to ( former referee ) @entity123 about it , i understand now officials do n't want to give penalties unless they are 100 per cent sure because if they get one wrong , they might not be given a game the following week			0
' @entity12 battles for the ball with @entity86 's @entity130 , with both grabbing hold of each other @entity133 was sent off for this elbow on @entity12 during a @entity77 match @entity12 is sent off after @entity136 went to ground , claiming to have been struck in the face by the striker 99 : @entity12 ( @entity140 , @entity141 , @entity13 ) 99 : @entity142 ( @entity143 , @entity144 , @entity145 , @entity146 ) 97 : @entity147 ( @entity148 ) 96 : @entity149 ( @entity59 , @entity86 , @entity53 ) 92 : @entity150 ( @entity151 , @entity81 , @entity145 , @entity144 , @entity63 , @entity152 ) 89 : @entity153 ( @entity154 , @entity146 , @entity141 , @entity155 ) 85 : @entity156 ( @entity157 , @entity59 , @entity158 , @entity159 ) 83 : @entity160 ( @entity13 , @entity145 , @entity144 ) 82 : @entity161 ( @entity148 , @entity53 ) 81 : @entity162 ( @entity53 , @entity148 ) during his career , @entity12 has seen a growing trend of strikers falling to the ground looking for penalties			1
it 's something he has never done but given the treatment dished out , he can see why with increasingly underhand tactics from markers , it is considered an option by others			0
' the most frustrating thing is i never tried to buy a foul or con the referee			0
i was too proud to go down if i felt the contact , it 'd be my mission to fight back even when they wrestled me , ' he explains			0
' and the irony is now that i am towards the end of my career and looking to go into coaching or management , i would want one of those defenders in my team , who would do anything to stop a goal			2
' centre - forward @entity12 played for seven clubs but was best known for his decade at @entity13 between 2003 and 2013 , particularly under @entity194 when he epitomised the club 's spirit			1
he took no prisoners on the football pitch but was equally sinned against by ruthless defenders			2
' i was n't one to complain but i know @entity194 ( @entity194 ) sent a dossier to the referees ' body after one particular match to highlight the treatment i was getting			0
he included a picture of me with scratch - marks all down my neck			0
' a lot of it 's about the way defenders have been brought up			0
if they have had an old - school defender running their youth team , it will be ingrained in them to stick tight and not give anyone an inch			0
' @entity220 has been highlighted recently but it is a difficult habit to get out of for a defender			0
it is like they ca n't stop themselves			2
from a corner , you are assigned a man and it 's your job to stop them any way possible			1
@entity220 of @entity232 was rightly penalised for wrestling @entity234 striker @entity233 to the ground @entity237 's @entity236 has also been penalised in the past for penalty area blocking @entity240 wrestles with @entity241 while @entity242 grapples @entity243 ( left ) referees are being urged to clamp down on the dark arts used in the penalty area after @entity5 launched our @entity2 campaign on monday			1
' there might be 18 or 20 players in the box all jostling			2
it is tough for referees but i guess if they do start giving penalties against defenders , it will stamp it out			0
' teams like @entity262 's @entity261 hated to play against @entity13 when @entity194 was in charge			1
@entity12 was also the subject of rough treatment but he preferred to fight his own battles rather than complain			0
the one exception led to him getting in hot water after a fall - out with referee @entity270 after having a goal disallowed for @entity13 against @entity152			1
' we were fighting relegation and i scored in the last minute which would have taken us up several places in the table			0
but @entity270 disallowed it because @entity279 fell over as i challenged him – and that after been genuinely kicked about during the game without going down ! ' he recalled			0
@entity12 rises to head home for @entity13 against @entity63 in the @entity77 in 2008 @entity12 shows his bravery to score during a @entity284 game against @entity144 @entity12 scores for @entity13 against @entity285 during a @entity77 game in 2012 @entity287 ( right ) reacts after @entity270 disallows @entity12 ' goal against @entity152 in 2010 for a push ' i was angry and said so because @entity270 seemed to book me in every game – i received a suspended ban for letting my feelings known			1
' @entity12 fears enforcing a ' @entity2 ' campaign wo n't be as simple as it sounds , however			0
' i remember @entity133 being sent off for @entity151 after elbowing me in the face ( @entity12 fractures his cheekbone )			2
later in the game , i want up @entity136 , i barely touched him but he screamed and i was sent off to even things up			0
' that is the danger for referees , that in their attempt to clean things up in the penalty area , they do n't just try to even things up for the sake of it			0
