a company is charging people more than $ 200,000 to be frozen after they die , and the chance to be brought back to life by future technologies			1
although the @entity6 company is quite open about the fact that there is no known way to revive the bodies , they sell this service based on the fact that future generations may have the answer			1
in 1990 @entity15 from @entity16 died at age 30 while on the operating table			0
he was transported to the @entity6			2
he was being operated for a brain tumor , he became @entity21 's first cryonic patient and is now being stored in @entity23 's facilities until the technology to revive him is discovered			2
for $ 200k you too could be frozen when you kick the bucket to possibly tbe revived in years to come ( stock image ) the process they use is called cyronic preservation , it is similar to the one used to preserve blood cells , embyros , sperm and stem cells			1
@entity38 - @entity21 comedian @entity37 is one of the many @entity21 who have put their hand up for the unusual scientific process			1
he has spoken openly about his curiosity about the future fuelling his desire to be revived in the future			0
@entity46 is the world ’s largest cryonics company , and according its ceo @entity48 , they ’re signing up customers from all over the world who want their bodies preserved when they die			1
the big ' freeze ' uses a solution much like antifreeze to preserve the body before being frozen and stored ( stock image ) ' the premise for cryopreservation is simple ' , @entity59 told @entity62			1
' cryopreservation can be thought of as the natural progression of this desire to keep someone alive using whatever means possible			0
cryonics is the same thing , said ms @entity59 , ' we just have to stop them from getting worse and let a more advanced technology in the future fix that problem			0
' the technology to bring back a person from their frozen state because the technology to revive them does not exist yet			1
@entity23 , an @entity6 company who sells the service says that they get clients from around the world ( stock image ) the icey price of freezing your brain is $ 80,000 and to preserve your whole body it will cost up to $ 200,000			1
once an @entity23 client has been officially declared dead , they begin the preservation process by moving body to an ice bed and cover them in a loose , slushy layer of ice			2
a device called a ' heart - lung resuscitator ’ is used to get the blood pumping through the body again , and medication is applied to the body to prevent the cells from deteriorating			0
next as much blood and bodily fluids are drained , then they are replaced with a solution like antifreeze			0
left : @entity48 ceo of @entity108 the company who sells the ' freeze ' services right : comedian @entity37 who has purchased a package where he will be frozen , stored and when the technology becomes available , potentially revived major blood vessels are then flushed of any blood then they are swabbed with the antifreeze solution			2
the antifreeze solution is used so that ice crystals do not form and damage any cells			0
the body is then cooled down to about 0.5 degrees celsius every hour until the final temperature of -195 degrees celciusis achieved over three weeks then the frozen body is stored .			0
