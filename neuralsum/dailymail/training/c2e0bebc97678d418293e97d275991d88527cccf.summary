by @entity0 published : 07:03 est , 11 december 2012 updated : 07:45 est , 11 december 2012 in the money : physicist @entity2 has been handed a £ 1.8million prize in recognition of his lifetime 's contribution to theoretical physics @entity2 says he might splash out on a holiday home after he was handed £ 1.8million in recognition of his lifetime contribution to theoretical physics			1
the former lucasian professor of mathematics at @entity12 is one of the latest winners of the most lucrative science prize ever established			1
the @entity15 awarded the huge sum to @entity17 , 70 , for his discovery that black holes emit radiation , and his ' deep contributions ' to quantum gravity and quantum aspects of the early universe			1
an identical prize was shared between the seven scientists who led the effort to discover a @entity29 - like particle at @entity31 's @entity30			1
set up in july by @entity33 internet billionaire @entity32 , the @entity15 aims to recognise scientific breakthroughs that have advanced our knowledge of the @entity37 at the deepest level			1
the winners were chosen by an independent committee of physicists , including @entity42 , the @entity45 - @entity44 physicists renowned for his work on dimensional deconstruction , and @entity48 , the string theorist			0
further prizes were awarded to other physicists in two categories in recognition for their achievements in the advancement of our understanding of fundamental physics			0
professor @entity2 told the @entity59 he was ' delighted and honoured ' to receive the $ 3million prize			2
' no one undertakes research in physics with the intention of winning a prize , ' he wrote in an email			2
' it is the joy of discovering something no one knew before			0
' nevertheless prizes like these play an important role in giving public recognition for achievement in physics			0
they increase the stature of physics and interest in it			0
' he added that he had not settled on how to spend his new - found wealth , but said at least some of the cash would go to helping his daughter with her autistic son and that he might put the rest towards a holiday home			1
a second $ 3million prize was shared between the scientists who led the team at the @entity30 who discovered what could be the long - predicted @entity29 particle			1
one of the recipients , @entity94 , head of the @entity30 , told the @entity59 he was ' gobsmacked ' to learn he had won the cash and would immediately go out and buy himself a new @entity97			2
another of the winners , @entity98 , head of the @entity99 at @entity31 , said she plans to use her $ 500,000 share to set up a fund to help out young physicists that she works with			1
@entity31 director general @entity106 said : ' it is a great honour for the @entity30 ’s achievement to be recognised in this way			2
' this prize recognizes the work of everyone who has contributed to the project over many years			0
' the @entity15 underlines the value of fundamental physics to society , and i am delighted that the foundation has chosen to hold its first award ceremony at @entity31			1
' breakthrough : a second prize of the same value was awarded to the scientists who led the discovery of what could be the @entity29 at the @entity30 at @entity31 earlier this year mr @entity32 , whose @entity126 will pay out the prize money , holds an advanced degree in theoretical physics from @entity130 , but abandoned his phd to study for an @entity132 and went on to make a fortune investing in social media			1
he said he hopes the prizes will help to bring recognition to the achievements of physicists and help support them to future breakthroughs			0
along with the two special prizes for @entity17 and the @entity31 team , the prize committee named a handful of other scientists who will be shortlisted for the $ 3million @entity15 to be announced next march			1
their work ranged from breakthroughs in quantum field theory , the development of exotic materials known as topological insulators , and discoveries in string theory			0
three further physicists under 35 were awarded $ 100,000 prizes for breakthroughs in other areas of physics			0
commenting on the selections , @entity42 , a member of the committee , said : ' choosing this year 's recipients from such a large pool of spectacular nominations was a very difficult task ' the selected physicists have done transformative work spanning a wide range of areas in fundamental physics			0
i especially look forward to future breakthroughs from the first recipients of the @entity173 in @entity15			2
' mr @entity32 added : ' i am very much pleased with the decisions of the @entity175			0
' i hope that the prizes will bring further recognition to some of the most brilliant minds in the world and the great accomplishments they have produced			0

@entity12 scientist is the latest winner of the @entity15
he says he will help autistic *grandson* and maybe buy holiday home
top scientists from @entity31 also share special prize of the same value
