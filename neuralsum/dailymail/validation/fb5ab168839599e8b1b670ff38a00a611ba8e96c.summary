@entity0 suffers from a rare blood disease - and as a result , has already undergone 60 blood transfusions at the age of just five			1
the youngster has @entity5 and to treat the condition , she has to go into hospital every four weeks for a blood transfusion			1
the disorder , which means her body can not produce red blood cells , is so rare it affects only around 125 people in the country			1
@entity0 ( pictured right receiving one of her regular blood transfusions in september 2013 ) has @entity5 , which means her body can not produce red blood cells when she was born , @entity0 had a slight heart murmur , but doctors told her mother @entity20 , from @entity21 , @entity22 , that it should go away in six weeks			1
mrs @entity0 , 44 , said : ' when i took @entity0 back for her check - up they said she looked a bit pale and they decided to take her in for a blood test			2
' the results came back and the doctors said she had to have an emergency blood transfusion as there were not enough red blood cells in her body			1
' we were then transferred to @entity37 's street hospital to have a bone marrow biopsy and told that @entity0 would have to have regular blood transfusions			1
' @entity0 ( pictured with mother @entity20 and father @entity40 ) has to go into hospital every four weeks for a transfusion @entity0 ( pictured at seven weeks ) was given an emergency transfusion after doctors decided to take a blood test during a check - up because she looked pale			1
she then had a bone marrow biopsy but just a couple of days after being sent home , @entity0 stopped breathing and her parents took her back to hospital			1
doctors were able to stabilise @entity0 's iron levels but she had to have an emergency operation to insert a port running from her jugular vein into her heart			2
' @entity0 stopped breathing and we had to rush her back into hospital where they starved her and put back on a milk formula , ' her mother added			2
' we were so scared of what might happen to her but we just wanted @entity0 to survive			0
' every week @entity0 has to get a nurse to attach a tube with a pump at the bottom to remove the excess iron from her blood			1
the pump stays attached to the port six days a week			2
. these pictures show the effects of steroid treatment to treat the rare blood disorder on @entity0 in october 2011 @entity0 's father @entity40 , 53 , said : ' the port restricts @entity0 from doing any contact sport and we have to be careful when we pick her up as we could knock the needle in her port			1
' the pump is essential for @entity0 as too much iron in the blood can be fatal and can cause major organ failures			1
' just before her fourth birthday , @entity0 's port blocked and we were rushed into hospital otherwise it could cause pressure on the jugular			2
' surgeons had to remove the port from her left hand side and insert it on the opposite side			0
' we have to make sure that the port is always clean which can be difficult as @entity0 has a low immune system and she contracted tonsillitis seven times in less than a year			0
' she now has a course on antibiotics every two weeks that helps her fight off any illnesses			0
' @entity0 's parents are hoping her body will start to regulate the iron in her body so that she only has to wear the pump at night time			1
her parents are hopeful that @entity0 will become eligible for a bone marrow transplant soon , which would ' fix ' her , meaning she would not need to continue with the current treatment method her father , a building services engineer , said they are hoping @entity0 will only have to have the pump attached at night time by the end of the year			2
' after that we would be hoping that her iron levels stay at a reasonable rate and then she would be eligible for a bone marrow transplant			0
' this procedure would ' fix ' @entity0 and she would n't need to have all of this current treatment			0
' it is an exciting but nerve racking experience - as there are so few people in the @entity126 who has this illness doctors can not predict what @entity0 's body will do			2
' it would be nice for @entity0 to have the bone marrow transplant especially now she is getting older and she is starting to get remarks from other children at school			0
' he aaded : ' it is now all a waiting process to see how @entity0 's body will react in the next couple of years			0
' you hear good stories and bad stories but we are just keeping our fingers crossed that @entity0 stays our brave , happy little girl			0
' red blood cells ( pictured ) are vital because they circulate oxygen around the body @entity5 ( @entity5 ) is a rare blood disease where the bone marrow fails to produce red blood cells			1
red blood cells are necessary for life because they circulate oxygen around the body			1
patients are usually diagnosed before the age of two and require treatment to compensate for their lack of red cell production			0
@entity5 can cause fatigue , poor growth , lack of appetite and a pale complexion			0
in about a half of cases patients also suffer associated congenital abnormalities			0
some affected children are short for their age and may have delayed puberty			0
@entity5 patients also have a slightly elevated risk of certain types of cancer			0
many @entity5 patients are treated with blood transfusions , often monthly , to bring their red blood cell count up to an acceptable level			1
but frequent transfusions cause an accumulation of iron in the body			0
because an overload of iron can cause damage to major organs if it is not properly managed , patients must take a ' chelation ' drug to remove excess iron from their bodies			2
this can take the form of a nightly infusion of medication via a needle over a ten hour period and in other cases , an oral drug can be taken daily			0

has @entity5 so her body ca n't produce red blood cells
the condition is so rare it affects only around 125 people in the country
@entity0 has to go into hospital every four weeks for a blood transfusion
for six days out of the week , @entity0 is attached to a tube which removes excess iron from her blood
