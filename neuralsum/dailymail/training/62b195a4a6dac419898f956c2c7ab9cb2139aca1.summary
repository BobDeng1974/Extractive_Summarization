by @entity0 @entity1 was tired of being asked what type of car he drives			1
as the male ceo of a billion dollar company and a married father - of - three , he would listen as his female counterparts were questioned on how they maintain a healthy work and family balance , wondering why the same was never asked of him			1
he was also tired of spending more time on planes flying around the world on business than he was with his wife and kids			0
so on wednesday @entity1 - who fronts fast - growing @entity19 database company @entity18 , which has grown $ 220 million in the last four years under his leadership - announced he was stepping down from the ' best job in the world ' in order to have more time at home			1
' this is the right choice ' : @entity1 , ceo of emerging database software company @entity18 , has announced he has stepped down from the demands of his role in order to have more time with his ' beautiful family ' family first : in this undated photo , @entity1 is seen with his daughter when she was younger			1
the tech ceo said he feels he has missed too many important moments with his kids to continue with his role ' life is about choices			1
right now , i choose to spend more time with my family and am confident that i can continue to have an meaningful and rewarding work life while doing so , ' @entity1 wrote on his blog			1
' at first , it seemed like a hard choice , but the more i have sat with the choice the more certain i am that it is the right choice			0
' @entity49 noted that @entity18 was last valued at $ 1 billion but is developing quickly and considered ' one of the most important tech companies in @entity19 '			1
the software the company offers is used as a backend by the likes of @entity56 and @entity57			2
as ceo , @entity1 stood to become ' phenomenally wealthy ' if he had stayed seen out the expected trajectory			1
but @entity1 - whose family are based in @entity60 - had more important plans			1
' i have three wonderful kids at home , aged 14 , 12 and 9 , and i love spending time with them : skiing , cooking , playing backgammon , swimming , watching movies or @entity71 or @entity72 games , talking , whatever , ' @entity1 wrote on his blog			1
' i have an amazing wife who also has an important career : she is a doctor and professor at @entity77 where , in addition to her clinical duties , she runs their training program for high risk obstetricians and conducts research on on prematurity , surgical techniques , and other topics			2
' she is a fantastic mom , brilliant , beautiful , and infinitely patient with me			0
' i love her , i am forever in her debt for finding a way to keep the family working despite my crazy travel			0
' i should not continue abusing that patience			0
' successful : @entity1 said that @entity18 grew by $ 220 million in the four years he was ceo			1
the company started in 2007 he will move into the role of vice chairman at @entity18 from september 3			1
@entity1 will be replaced admirably , @entity1 said @entity18 needs a leader that is ' all in ' and that is why he is relinquishing his role			1
additionally , he is fatalistic about the jobs that such a decision - and making that decision public - will cost him in years to come			1
' i recognize that by writing this i may be disqualifying myself from some future ceo role , ' he wrote online			1
' will that cost me tens of millions of dollars someday ? maybe			0
' @entity1 told @entity107 that the decision came to him on an overnight flight to @entity110			2
he commutes from @entity19 to @entity111 , @entity60 , every two to three weeks which , along with other travel , would tally his flyer miles at over 300,000 per year			2
his flight had to make an emergency landing @entity116 , but , exhausted , he slept through it			0
he woke to see some crew members were traumatized by the emergency and had to be replaced by other staff			0
' in that moment , i realized , '' what am i doing ? " ' he told the magazine			0
earlier this summer , @entity124 asked @entity125 , the ceo of @entity126 , whether she could balance the demands of being a mom and being a ceo			2
the @entity129 asked similar questions of @entity132 ’s female ceo @entity131			2
as a male ceo , i have been asked what kind of car i drive and what type of music i like , but never how i balance the demands of being both a dad and a ceo			2
while the press have n’t asked me , it is a question that i often ask myself			0
here is my situation : friends and colleagues often ask my wife how she balances her job and motherhood			0
somehow , the same people do n’t ask me			0
a few months ago , i decided the only way to balance was by stepping back from my job			2
@entity18 is a special company			1
in my nearly 4 years at the company , we have raised $ 220 million , grown the team 15x and grown sales 30x			1
we have amazing customers , a great product which gets better with every release , the strongest team i have ever worked with , and incredible momentum in the market			0
the future is bright and @entity18 deserves a leader who can be “ all - in ” and make the most of the opportunity			1
unfortunately , i can not be that leader given the geography of the majority of the company in @entity19 and my family in @entity60			1
i recognize that by writing this i may be disqualifying myself from some future ceo role			2
will that cost me tens of millions of dollars someday ? maybe			0
right now , i choose to spend more time with my family and am confident that i can continue to have an meaningful and rewarding work life while doing so			0
at first , it seemed like a hard choice , but the more i have sat with the choice the more certain i am that it is the right choice			0
in one month , i will hand the ceo role to an incredibly capable leader in @entity183			2
he will have the task of leading the company through its next phase of growth ( though thankfully not of commuting across the country while doing it ! )			0
i know the company will be in great hands ; his skills fit our next phase of growth better than mine do			0
and i will be there to help ( full time , but ' normal full time ' and not ' crazy full time ' ) in whatever areas he needs help			0
more about the announcement can be found in today ’s press release			0
i hope i will be able to find a way to craft a role at @entity18 which is engaging , impactful , and compatible with the most important responsibilities in my life			1
as great as this job has been , i look forward to creating one which is even better			0
