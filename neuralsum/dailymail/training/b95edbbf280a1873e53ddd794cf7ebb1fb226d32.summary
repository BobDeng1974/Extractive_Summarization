@entity0 suggested tuesday that president @entity1 bears no responsibility for his decision to pull @entity5 troops out of @entity6 at the end of 2011 , a decision that created a power vacuum now filled by a vicious @entity11 terror group			1
' in retrospect , that was a mistake by the @entity6 government , ' she said during a town hall on @entity16			1
@entity17 was referring to the two governments ' failure to sign a mutual @entity20 , a document that would have kept @entity5 servicemen and women in @entity6 as a stabilizing force after 2011			1
@entity6 prime minister @entity25 reportedly balked on a @entity5 proposal because it would have included legal immunity for @entity5 troops who broke local laws			1
the group , formerly called @entity52 in @entity6 , aims to institute an @entity60 ' caliphate ' – a nation that transcends the borders of existing countries – held together by strict @entity65 law			1
the @entity5 has sent warships and aircraft carriers into the @entity68 in the last week while @entity1 decides whether to engage @entity42 with airstrikes			1
the @entity70 said monday that @entity1 had sent 275 troops into @entity46 to protect the evacuation of embassy personnel and assets while they are moved far away from the fighting			2
on tuesday @entity42 reached within 60 miles of @entity6 's capital city			1
much of their advance has come with the help of @entity5 arms , tanks , rockets and other war materiel , seized as @entity6 army regulars and reserves fled			2
@entity17 left the @entity1 administration in early 2013 , but spoke like a policymaker who is still in charge of @entity5 foreign policy during tuesday 's live event			1
the maybe - presidential - candidate assured her audience of nearly 200 hand - picked people at the @entity94 in @entity95 that ' we are certainly not putting @entity5 soldiers at risk			2
no boots on the ground			0
' @entity17 entered the stage for the event , moderated by @entity16 's @entity39 , to wild applause , hoots and hollers and an extended ovation			2
she quickly acknowledged the carnival - like atomsphere of her cable - tv coming out event , boasting that her friends in the @entity113 were having a ' watch party			0
' commenting on monday 's capture of @entity116 , an accused ringleader of the september 11 , 2012 attack on @entity5 's diplomatic station in @entity119 , @entity120 , she said she was ' very pleased			1
' ' this is another indication ... that the @entity5 has an unwavering commitment to bring to justice those who are responsible for attacks on @entity5 , ' @entity17 said			2
and commenting on the nearly two years that have passed , in which @entity116 openly operated in @entity120 and gave media interviews while wipping strawberry frappes in cafes , she insisted that no one in the federal government slow - walked the @entity119 investigation			0
' it took more than ten years to being @entity136 to @entity137 , ' @entity17 said			0
pushback : @entity6 @entity140 volunteers are now fighting against jihadi militants near @entity46 , hoping to stop @entity42 from capturing more of their country the quick march : @entity42 has already captured the red - shaded areas in this map of @entity6 and surrounding countries @entity17 gave prominent mention to a @entity149 report which seemed to clear her of wrongdoing related to the @entity119 facilities ' lack of security on the eleventh anniversary of the first 9/11 terror attacks			1
that investigation , however , has come under fire for failing to interview @entity17			0
she said she feels the pain of the mothers and family members of the four @entity5 who died in the @entity119 conflagration , caused by the @entity11 terror group @entity164			1
' i can see why she and others are inconsolable , ' @entity17 said			0
but ' we need to be in dangerous places ... we 're doing the best we can to find out what happened			0
' ' there 's a lot we do n’t know , ' she said			0
' now that we have @entity116 in custody , hopefully we will learn more from his perspective			0
' the @entity5 government , she assured viewers , wants to know ' what the motivations of the leaders , of the attackers , happened to be			0
' @entity17 has been widely criticized for claiming in the early days after the attack that a spontaneous mob angered by an anti-islam video attacked the @entity119 compound , and not a premeditated terrorist group			0
no one asked her about that awkward chapter .			0

during a @entity16 broadcast , former @entity191 @entity0 said president @entity1 is **n't** to blame for the lack of a @entity5 military *presence* in @entity6
it 's @entity6 prime minister @entity25 's fault , she said , for failing to sign a @entity20 with the @entity70
@entity1 reportedly did **n't** make the agreement a priority because he aimed to pull out of @entity6 in order to fulfill a campaign pledge
@entity5 's troop *withdrawal* created a power vacuum now filled by @entity42 , a vicious @entity11 group responsible for mass killings
the organization has conquered *northern* @entity6 cities and aims to establish a *transnational* ' state ' in parts of @entity54 and @entity6 , governed by @entity65 law
