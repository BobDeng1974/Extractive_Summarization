technology that might have averted the @entity3 tragedy by remotely seizing control of the plane has existed for years – but has been resisted by the aviation industry , it emerged last night support for real - time monitoring of jets from the ground has stalled amid airline fears of the dangers of eliminating pilots and the possibilities of a so - called cyber-hijack by terrorists			1
unions representing pilots are also against the move			1
the 9/11 attacks on the @entity21 , in which terrorists used hijacked aircraft as weapons , sparked calls for new systems to prevent a repeat of the atrocity			0
he told @entity52 : ' the ill - thought reinforced cockpit door has had catastrophic consequences			1
' mr @entity47 said thinking about airline safety had been skewed by the 2001 terror attacks , adding that there had been ' excessive attention given to terrorism ' and a ' failure to address other threats to aviation security '			1
manufacturers in @entity64 and @entity21 have worked on ways of creating a ‘ hijack - proof ’ aircraft			1
in 2006 , @entity67 was awarded a @entity21 patent for an ‘ uninterruptible autopilot system ’			1
this would allow pilots , ground controllers or security agencies such as the @entity74 to activate an automatic flight mode that can not be turned off by anyone on board			1
the system could also switch itself on if terrorists tried to fight their way into the cockpit , with pressure sensors on the door responding to excessive force			1
eight previous crashes have been caused by suspected pilot suicide , leading to 416 deaths			0
november 29 , 2013 : @entity88 crashed in @entity89 , killing 33 people			0
october 31 , 1999 : 217 people died after @entity92 from @entity94 crash - landed in the sea			1
october 11 , 1999 : an @entity97 pilot grounded for medical reasons took off and crashed his plane			0
he was the only fatality			0
december 19 , 1997 : 104 people were killed when @entity102 crashed in @entity103			0
august 21 , 1994 : a @entity105 pilot flew into the @entity106 , killing 44 people			0
july 13 , 1994 : a @entity110 @entity109 engineer crashed a plane he stole at a military base , killing himself			0
august 22 , 1979 : a recently sacked mechanic crashed a stolen plane in @entity115 , killing four			0
september 26 , 1976 : twelve died when a @entity110 pilot directed his plane at his ex-wife ’s flat			0
the aircraft ’s flight path could be radioed to it by ground control , and it would be brought safely down at a nearby airport using existing automatic landing aids			1
sources at @entity67 claimed at the time that the anti-hijack equipment could be fitted to planes all over the world by 2010			0
but this has failed to happen amid safety concerns from pilots and airlines , and the technology remains unproven			1
the ability to direct pilotless aircraft from the ground is well established – military drones have long been used for surveillance and targeted missile attacks			1
in 2013 , a 16 - seater @entity141 airliner became the first passenger plane to fly ‘ unmanned ’ across @entity144 civilian airspace			1
it was controlled remotely from the ground for the 500 - mile journey , though a pilot on board handled the take - off and landing			1
but the idea of flying a plane carrying hundreds of passengers without any human intervention continues to worry experts			0
@entity144 ’s @entity157 said there was no remote control system currently available that could cope with navigating the country ’s crowded skies			1
a spokesman added : ‘ there are companies working on it , but the technology does n’t exist in a practical or useable form yet			1
’ pilots ’ union @entity167 fears using pilotless planes or allowing authorities to remotely take control of a stricken or hijacked aircraft – and believes it could leave planes in danger of being ‘ hacked ’ from afar			1
a spokesman said : ‘ having at least two pilots on the flight deck has helped make flying an incredibly safe form of public transport			2
the focus in the wake of this tragic accident is likely to be on ensuring that both pilots always have access to the cockpit and can not be prevented from re-entering			2
‘ with this and any other measures we must act with careful consideration to ensure we do n’t create new safety risks or concerns such as those raised by the vulnerability of any form of remote control of a passenger aircraft			0
’ aviation safety analyst @entity199 said there had been frequent calls for remote - controlled aircraft takeover systems since 9/11			1
but he also argued that this could pose more risks to passengers , with ground controllers unable to see all that a pilot on board could see			1
there is also a danger the technology would allow cyber-terrorists to hack into an airliner ’s controls			2
mr @entity199 added : ‘ there has always been a desire to have the ability to control planes from the ground … but the ground element of that was entirely pooh - poohed by the aviation industry for a whole variety of reasons , not least of which is aircraft safety			1
‘ questions will always be posed as to whether pilots should be taken out of the equation in the event of something like this so ground control would take over … i personally would not feel comfortable getting on any airliner where control could be taken away from the pilots and co-pilots			1
’ youngest victim : seven - month - old @entity238 , pictured with his mother @entity239 ( also right ) , died when the @entity240 crashed 9/11 rules allowed tragedy to happen the disaster was made possible because of rules introduced after the 9/11 attacks to keep hijackers out of aircraft cockpits			1
here @entity249 and @entity248 analyse how co-pilot @entity250 took advantage of his colleague ’s toilet break to crash the plane when are pilots allowed to leave the cockpit ? the days when aircraft captains wandered through the cabin chatting to air hostesses and children are long gone			2
in general both pilots must remain in their positions at the controls of at all times , and on short - haul flights they generally do not budge			1
but once the jet is safely in the air , they can get up to use the toilet as long as they are not absent any longer than is necessary			2
@entity269 , the pilot of the @entity3 plane , waited to reach cruising altitude before stepping out of the cockpit , pictured @entity269 , the pilot of the @entity3 plane , waited to reach cruising altitude at 38,000ft before stepping out of the cockpit			0
why was @entity250 allowed to remain on the flight deck on his own ? it is considered best practice to ensure that there are always two people in the cockpit to avoid tragedies like tuesday ’s			0
a relief pilot travels on some long - haul flights so the other crew members can get some sleep			2
access to the cockpit door on the @entity288 ( like the one above ) can be disabled from inside the flight deck to prevent hijacking many airlines have a rule that another crew member must replace the pilot or co-pilot while they go to the toilet			0
but , in line with @entity299 aviation authority requirements , @entity3 did not stipulate that a pilot could not be left alone in the cockpit			2
@entity144 ’s @entity157 yesterday changed its guidance in light of this week ’s disaster and now urges @entity144 airlines to enforce the two - person rule			2
several @entity64 airlines , including @entity308 , have announced that they will now insist that two crew remain in the cockpit at all times			0
why was the pilot unable to get back into the cockpit ? the black box voice recorder recovered from the wreckage reveals that mr @entity269 first knocked gently on the door seeking to get back in after his brief toilet trip			0
as the minutes passed and he realised his crazed co-pilot was steering all 150 people on board to their deaths , he became increasingly desperate and attempted to smash the door down			0
but @entity250 was able to barricade himself inside the cockpit thanks to an armoured bullet - proof door designed to protect passengers by keeping out terrorists			2
these were made mandatory after the 9/11 terror attacks on the @entity21			0
to save weight , the reinforced cockpit doors often contain bullet - proof @entity332 and other super-strong composite compounds , as well as metal			2
the @entity288 has a keypad outside the cockpit which allows cabin crew to gain access by tapping in a secret code if the pilots become incapacitated for some reason			2
but the pilot can flick a switch to lock the door from the inside , which deactivates the external keypad for between five and 20 minutes			0
what screening did @entity250 undergo before being allowed to fly ? top airlines use psychological testing to check that would - be pilots are able to cope with stressful situations as well as possessing the skills needed to fly a large aircraft			1
anyone found to have a history of alcohol or drug addiction or a serious mental health problem faces being rejected			0
flight crew have regular medical check - ups			2
those under 40 are examined once a year , while older pilots undergo tests every six months			0
doctors look for health issues , including signs of stress , fatigue , drug or alcohol abuse that may point to deeper psychological problems			0
without their medical certificate pilots are not allowed to fly			0
aviation psychologist professor @entity373 said : ‘ every time they arrive at an airport they have to check - in and meet with other staff – to not spot a pilot with mental health problems would be rare			1
’ @entity381 , the parent company of @entity3 , said its air crew were chosen extremely carefully and subjected to psychological vetting .			0

technology that might have averted @entity33 tragedy has existed for years but has been resisted by aviation industry
' @entity390 autopilot system ' would allow ground controllers to activate mode that can not be turned off on jet
but support has stalled amid fears of dangers of eliminating pilots and possibilities of so - called cyber-hijacks
