it has become a craze with humans , and even pets have been getting in on the act			1
and now , it seems , even wild fish have been infected with photobombing , judging from these pictures of @entity9 , who has become the main attraction for divers near @entity13 , off @entity15 's @entity14			1
the bright yellow and blue parrotfish loves nothing better than getting his toothy grin in people 's pictures as tourists pose with him in his underwater world			1
the brightly - coloured fish spends about six hours a day making mischief with tour parties @entity43 is genuinely considered to ruin people 's pictures but , as these snaps reveal , tourists are delighted when he becomes part of their holiday memories			1
@entity51 , general manager for @entity15 , said grinning @entity9 had become something of a celebrity			2
he said : ' @entity9 's been around for a couple of years now , and he looks forward to coming over and grinning his lovely little head off at all our guests			2
' he does seem to actually swim up for his photo , and with a free feed on offer and gorgeous females for company , who would n't be smiling ? ' seriously though , in some photos he seems to have less of a grin than others , but i reckon he 's still having a ball			1
' centre of attention : @entity9 loves stealing the limelight but is equally happy playing with his mates once the tours have packed up for the day pucker : some might say @entity9 has a bit of a narcissistic streak as he sidles up for another snap @entity51 said the diving tours operate within the guidelines of the @entity80 to ensure conservation			2
bluebarred parrotfish like @entity9 grow up to 1m - long and to 6.5kg in weight			0
their teeth in both jaws are fused into a parrot - like peak			0
adults normally swim alone and feed by scraping algae from the reef and coral			0
@entity9 and his species are vital to the reef - building process because they crush rubble and dead coral into sand as they feed			0
he said : ' we feed less than 1kg of approved fish food per day to the hundreds of fish that like @entity9 , enjoy meeting @entity15 guests			1
' our staff do the feeding , not the guests , but they get to enjoy watching him come up and grin into their faces as he swipes a little feed			0
' i would realistically expect that from a conservation viewpoint there is little difference , regulations help ensure this , by our presence in the water			0
' we operate for less than six hours a day , so @entity118 and his mates are off elsewhere or just hanging around for the other 18 or so hours			0

fish ca n't resist *hijacking* divers ' photographs by the @entity14
