the culprit who sparked a murder scare after leaving ' a trail of blood ' along a jetty that was visible on @entity6 was today revealed to be a wet dog called @entity8			1
the ' blood ' seen in the image was in fact a trail of water left by the dog after it went for a swim			2
@entity8 's hounding down has ended days of guesswork as to whether a crime scene had been captured by aerial photos			1
the mystery aerial shot : this image showing what appeared to be a grisly crime scene in a park in the city of @entity27 , @entity28 , sparked days of speculation as to what it could really be the satellite shot from @entity6 maps had sparked online speculation that a vicious crime may have taken place and gone undetected in the @entity28 city of @entity27			1
first posted on @entity39 , it shows what looks like a trail of blood apparently leading on to a waterside jetty jutting into a lake in @entity45 , in the heart of the city			1
at the end of the trail it appears as though two people are standing over a dead body , preparing to throw it into the water			0
but investigations carried out by fans of the popular social news site revealed that the ' crime scene ' was in fact nothing of the sort			0
@entity62 - eyed internet sleuths used a little - known technique to zoom right into the image to reveal that it was in fact a soggy dog which had left what looked like the bloody trail			1
and now the dog 's owner has come forward to tell of her surprise when she realised the picture , which went viral online , in fact showed her and a friend out playing catch with her dog , @entity8			1
' when i saw the picture i realised , " it 's my dog "			2
he loves the water , ' she told @entity81 ' he jumps off the end of the jetty , swims around to the bridge and runs down to the edge again			0
' it 's hilarious that everyone thought it was murder			1
but it 's great he 's now world famous			2
' detailed analysis : once one @entity39 user revealed how fellow laptop sleuths could zoom in more closely to the image posted by ncav , they began annotating the image to attempt to prove the wet dog theory even more detailed analysis : another @entity39 user posted this image which attempted to explain what was going on in the ambiguous - looking scene in even greater detail the city of @entity27 where the bizarre @entity6 image was captured is @entity107 's newest city and home to more than 193,000 people			1
the first homes were only completed in 1976			0
the image was originally posted on april 12 by a @entity39 user named ncav , with the caption : ' a murder near my house on @entity6 , link in comments			1
' inside the comments attached to the post , the user added that he and his friend had told the police about the apparent crime			0
further commenters then sought to debunk the murder hypothesis			2
the investigation really took off when @entity128 shared a little - known trick which allowed fellow users to zoom in further than anyone had previously managed			1
it involved grabbing the @entity133 usually used to share the map via email or social media and changing the number at the very end of the link from 22 to 23			0
' if @entity6 has imagery at that higher zoom level , it will show it to you , ' added xythrowawayy			0
@entity145 builds : the city of @entity27 where the @entity6 image was captured is the @entity28 ' newest city and home to more than 193,000 people			0
the first homes were only completed in 1976 but it was @entity152 who was the first to work out that what the image shows is in fact a dog which has left a wet trail along the jetty 's wooden deck , and not a body surrounded by blood			2
' looks like a dog got out of the water and shook itself dry , then walked off the dock while dripping water , the wet wood looks much darker in colour , ' wrote @entity152			0
' you can clearly see where the dog shook , walked off the deck , then walked back to his owner on a separate lighter coloured path on the bottom			0
' two users on the site then annotated the zoomed - in image to point out more details that appeared to confirm the wet - dog theory			1
a third then zoomed out a little to point out that there were other people walking right past the supposed bloody crime scene , while another used @entity6 distance measuring tool to estimate that the ' body ' is just 3.5ft long			0
' this is either a dog or a midget murder , ' quipped @entity190 .			0
