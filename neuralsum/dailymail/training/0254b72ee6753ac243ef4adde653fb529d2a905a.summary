life imitates art : the scanners echo the 2002 @entity49 blockbuster @entity47 , in which @entity51 ¿ s character is bombarded with advertising specifically designed for him the system also has hundreds of visual characteristics stored , such as areas of shadow , logged as ‘ dark zones ’ , and distances between facial features			2
