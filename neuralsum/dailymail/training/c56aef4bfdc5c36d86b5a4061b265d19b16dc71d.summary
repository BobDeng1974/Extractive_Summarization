by @entity0 @entity2 has dodged a triple - dip recession and is finally on the road to recovery , a leading international watchdog declared today			1
the @entity6 said the @entity2 economy grew at an annual rate of 0.5 per cent in the first quarter of 2013			1
that is the equivalent of just over 0.1 per cent on a quarterly basis and enough to avoid another recession following the 0.3 per cent slump in the final three months of 2012			0
figures published by the @entity15 confirmed the economy shrank by 0.3 per cent in the final quarter of 2012 @entity18 , deputy general secretary of the @entity6 and its chief economist , said the situation ' is still fragile ' but ' improvements are beginning to be seen '			1
the @entity23 - based think tank said growth would pick up to an annual rate of 1.4 per cent in the second quarter of the year as @entity2 emerges from the economic doldrums			1
it came as official @entity2 figures showed the crucial services sector grew by 0.3 per cent in january - its strongest rate of expansion for five months			0
the @entity15 said output in the sector , which makes up three - quarters of the economy and includes pubs , stock brokers and hairdressers , was 0.8 per cent higher than a year earlier			0
it bolstered hopes that @entity2 has avoided a triple - dip recession despite the freezing weather and the crisis in @entity43			1
the @entity15 will publish the official number for the first quarter in late april			2
mr @entity18 said : ' the situation [ in the @entity2 ] is still fragile			0
i think the policy course , both in terms of monetary and fiscal policy , is going in the right direction and improvements are beginning to be seen			0
' while the unemployment rate has fallen , a sign of an improving economy , the depseration of jobseekers was laid bare today when 4,000 people turned out hoping to find work at a new shopping centre			0
long queues started to build two hours before the jobs fair at the @entity64 , in @entity65 , @entity66 , got under way , drawing in people from all walks off life clutching cvs and laptops in a bid to make the right impression			0
a one - in - one - out policy was operated as queues mounted for a jobs fair at the @entity64 , in @entity66 @entity77 , chief @entity2 economist at @entity78 , said : ' the 0.3 per cent rise in services output in january is very good news for hopes that the economy can avoid further contraction in the first quarter of 2013 and dodge a triple dip			1
' the odds are swinging towards the economy avoiding another gdp fall in the first quarter as long as the latest bout of snow does not have a significant distorting impact			1
' but other analysts were less confident			0
@entity95 , economist at @entity96 , said : ' it 's a close call but my feeling is a triple - dip recession is more likely than not			1
' @entity101 , chief @entity2 economist at @entity102 , said : ' the economy is flatlining			0
2013 will probably be a write - off			2
' the @entity6 forecasts will be a welcome boost for chancellor @entity107 @entity2 is trapped in the longest downturn for more than a century and the economy is still more than three per cent smaller than it was before the crisis struck in 2008			1
a third recession since then would be a further setback for @entity107 in the wake of last week 's gloomy budget			0
the @entity115 slashed in half its growth forecasts for this year to just 0.6 per cent and said the deficit - reduction plan has stalled			2
but it predicted growth of 0.1 per cent in the first quarter - indicating that there will be no triple - dip - although the @entity121 has warned the chances of another recession are 50 - 50			1
@entity2 has already been stripped of its @entity125 credit rating by international agency @entity126 and rival @entity127 has warned that the country faces another downgrade by the end of april as the chancellor struggles to deal with the soaring national debt			0
it is feared that another downgrade could sent the pound tumbling and drive up borrowing costs for the government , businesses and households			0
@entity140 , chief economist at @entity141 , said : ' stronger growth in the services sector at the start of the year has greatly reduced the risk of the @entity2 falling back into a triple - dip recession			1
' the country is not out of the woods yet , with much depending on how the economy has coped with adverse weather conditions in recent months , and the indications are that any growth is still disappointingly weak			2
' even if the political embarrassment of a triple - dip recession is avoided , the underlying weakness of the economy still has the potential to trigger further credit rating downgrades , putting selling pressure on gilts and sterling			2

@entity6 says that the worst of the economic gloom has passed
predicts growth of 0.5 *%* in the first quarter of 2013 , avoiding triple dip
