scheming @entity10 , 38 , and @entity11 , 27 , masterminded a nationwide scam described by one senior detective as one of the most ' complex and elaborate ' crimes he had ever investigated			1
the duo struck at dozens of @entity4 branches as well as @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22 supermarkets and stole up to Â£ 147,000 worth of cooking oil which they siphoned into their vans			1
guilty : @entity11 , left , and @entity10 , right , have been jailed for two years each for the ' complex and elaborate ' scam of stealing used cooking oil and selling it on as biodiesel fuel posing as waste removal staff for an oil recycling company , they then went on to sell the stolen oil at a premium to a processing plant who converted it into eco-friendly biodiesel			1
police were first alerted to their suspicious activities in february this year after an alarm on an oil tanker at @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 , was activated			0
the friends claimed to have been looking for somewhere to eat but backtracked when officers discovered a vat of foul - smelling used cooking oil in the back of their @entity51 van			1
although the pair backtracked and claimed they actually worked for a waste company , they were promptly arrested			0
officers then linked them to 13 unsolved offences - dating from november 2011 to february 2012 - up and down the @entity6			0
@entity10 and @entity11 were charged and appeared at @entity58 in july but when they were released on bail pending their trial they went on to commit further crimes at the three supermarkets			2

' on the face of it , the crimes of @entity10 and @entity11 may seem harmless enough , but with so many businesses that employ local people struggling to make ends meet in these tough times , sustained losses on this scale could have very well meant they went under resulting in lost jobs			0
