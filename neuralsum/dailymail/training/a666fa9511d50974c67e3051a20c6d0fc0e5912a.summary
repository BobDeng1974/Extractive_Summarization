by @entity0 the dark skies of the @entity2 provide a stunning backdrop for these colourful images of the majestic @entity5			1
photographer @entity6 used a @entity8 dslr camera to capture images of the spectacular constellation above the familiar beach scenes of @entity13 ’s largest island			1
the 22 - year - old , who shot the pictures over a year of stargazing on the island , often stayed up until dawn to catch the most dramatic skyscapes			1

mr @entity6 , a graphic designer from @entity26 , @entity2 , used foregrounds of abandoned theme parks , harbours and lighthouses against the illuminated sky			0
‘ the perfect conditions to take these pictures are a clear sky on a moonless night , ’ he said ' light pollution needs to be minimal too , unfortunately for the @entity36 there are very few areas of dark sky , especially in @entity13			0

pictured is the @entity5 behind @entity46 , a small harbour in @entity47 this stunning image shows the @entity49 steps in @entity2			2
mr @entity6 , a graphic designer from @entity26 on the island used foregrounds of abandoned theme parks , harbours and lighthouses against the illuminated sky a combination of 120 separate photographs over the space on an hour were used to capture the stars trail on 24 june 2014 ( left )			1
on the right , the @entity5 is pictured above an abandoned roundabout from @entity62 a panoramic image shows the reflection of the @entity5 in the glass - like water of @entity66			1
minor adjustments were made to bring out the contrast and whites in this collection of images the @entity5 is thought to be 120,000 light years across and contains more than 200 billion stars			1
this makes it a ‘ middleweight ’ galaxy with the largest galaxy known , @entity77 , containing more than 100 trillion stars			0
on a clear night , when you look up into the night sky the most you can see from any one point on the @entity83 is about 2,500 stars			0
like more than two - thirds of the known galaxies , the @entity5 has a spiral shape			2
at the centre of the spiral , a lot of energy and , occasionally , vivid flares are created			0
based on the immense gravity that would be required explain the movement of stars and the energy expelled , astronomers believe the centre of the @entity5 has a supermassive black hole			2
astronomers believe the @entity5 was n’t always a stunning barred spiral			0
it formed into its current size and shape by ‘ eating ’ other galaxies			0
in one image the @entity5 can be seen above @entity19 in incredible hues of pink , orange , blue , green and purple			1
a separate picture captures the stars trail on 24 june 2014 in the @entity2 using a combination of 120 separate photographs over the space on an hour			1
mr @entity6 also captured images of the moon shining bright behind @entity118 , a 14th century lighthouse			2
a separate image shows a luminous moon behind @entity19			1
other highlights include the galactic core of the @entity5 occupied by two small wooden boats , while a panoramic image shows the reflection of the @entity5 in the glass - like water of @entity66			1
the majority of mr @entity6 ’s photographs are single exposures taken in a raw image format			0
this captures more detail than a jpeg format which is altered in @entity134 - an editing program - by bringing out the contrast and whites in the image			0
mr @entity6 added : ' today ’s dslr cameras can gather much more light and capture a lot more detail than our eyes can			2
' @entity146 is still visible to the naked eye in dark sky areas , it just appears as a faint white strip in the sky , which is still an incredible sight to see			1
' before i picked up a camera i never thought it would be possible to take pictures like this without travelling to low light areas such as @entity157 or @entity158			0
' it ’s an incredible feeling being able to share my photographs with people , and make them more aware of what can be seen in low light polluted areas here in @entity36			0

mr @entity6 said : ' today ’s dslr cameras can gather much more light and capture a lot more detail than our eyes can ' a super moon behind the gates to heaven at @entity19 is pictured here			1
