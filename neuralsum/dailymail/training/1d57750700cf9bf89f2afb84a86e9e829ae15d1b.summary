if this cliff was on @entity2 it 'd be among the tallest in the world - but it 's on a comet just two and a half miles wide			2
the towering , jagged edifice , half a mile high with 65ft boulders at its foot , was revealed by an amateur astronomer who studied an image beamed back by the @entity14 probe as it orbits comet @entity15 – @entity17			1
from his home in @entity21 in the @entity22 , @entity19 's creation has been picked by @entity23 as its astronomy picture of the day - leading him to declare with delight : ' @entity26 came early for me today ! '			1
amateur astronomer @entity19 wrote : ' just imagine standing there , craning your neck back ' the original image was one of many released from the £ 1.1billion @entity14 probe , which has been orbiting comet @entity31 since it caught up with it in august following a ten - year , four billion mile chase			1
mr @entity19 relied on notes by the @entity46 which said the picture - pieced together from four taken 12 miles from the comet on december 10 - measured 1.8 by 1.6 miles from end to end			2
he tilted and cropped the image so just the cliff remained , pointing vertically down to what appeared to be the duck - shaped comet 's centre			0
' as soon as i saw that image i could see one area was just crying out to be cropped and turned into a landscape view , ' he wrote on his blog @entity60			0
' is n't that something ? ' i think that is a genuinely stunning view			0
just imagine standing there , at the foot of those cliffs , with those huge boulders scattered all around you , craning your head back to look up at the wall looming in front of and above you			0
' original : the image was taken from the right hand side of this image , a composite of four taken by the @entity14 probe on december 10 some 12 miles from the rubber - duck - shaped comet 's surface and measuring 1.8 by 1.6 miles from end to end beauty : the comet is hurtling towards the sun at 83,900mph and will reach its nearest point in august of next year , scientists say according to @entity23 the boulders at the foot of the ice and rock face , which are on surprisingly smooth , sandy - looking terrain , could measure 65ft across on their own			1
but anyone who jumped off the enormous cliff would be likely to survive because of the comet 's low surface gravity , which is several hundred thousand times weaker than that on @entity2			0
@entity14 is still orbiting the comet despite scientists losing contact with its £ 172million robotic surface lander , @entity100 , which landed at an angle with its solar panels partially obscured last month			1
that mean the @entity46 had just 60 hours to gather data about the comet 's make - up before its batteries ran out			2
@entity14 itself will remain in orbit around the comet as it hurtles towards the sun at around 83,900mph , reaching its closest point in august 2015 before it sweeps around and back out of the solar system			2
unseen world : some parts of the comet appear remarkably smooth , but it is pockmarked with jagged cliffs and impact craters a mountain to climb : the high - resolution images are a far cry from those sent back by @entity23 's voyager probes in the late 1980s the project has already been hailed as one of the greatest scientific achievements of 2014 by the journal @entity129			1
data from @entity14 recently showed that water on the comet had a strikingly different composition to that on @entity2 - suggesting the water on our world came from an asteroid , not a comet as previously thought			0
the half - mile cliff on @entity141 , about a fifth of the size of the entire comet , is the same size as the highest sea cliffs on @entity2 - which tower half a mile high over the @entity148 in @entity149 , @entity150			1
however , it is far from the most dramatic rock features found in the solar system			0
the highest cliffs ever seen were spotted by @entity23 's @entity156 probe in 1982 as it photographed @entity157 , one of the moons of @entity159			0
despite the moon measuring just 300 miles across , it had a gigantic ice cliff with a sheer vertical relief of 12 miles - making it more than ten times higher than the walls of the @entity166			0
into the void : the half - mile cliff on @entity141 , about a fifth of the size of the entire comet , is the same size as the highest sea cliffs on @entity2 despite the impressive features of the comet ( pictured ) , @entity157 has the tallest cliffs in the solar system at 12 miles			1

*beautiful* photograph from @entity46 's @entity14 probe was *analysed* by @entity19 at his home in the @entity22
he *enhanced* it and found a towering cliff on the *2.5* - mile comet , which is hurtling through space at 83,900mph
@entity14 began orbiting @entity141 in august and is still there despite losing contact with @entity100 surface probe
ten - year , £ 1.1billion project has been hailed as one of the scientific *community* 's greatest achievements of 2014
