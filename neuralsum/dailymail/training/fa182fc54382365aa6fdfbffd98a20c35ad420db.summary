dr @entity0 faces being struck off after he told an undercover reporter that he could arrange for female circumcision to be carried out on two girls aged 10 and 13 a doctor faces being struck off after he told an undercover reporter that he could arrange for female circumcision to be carried out on two girls aged 10 and 13			1
dr @entity0 was caught on camera discussing female genital mutilation ( @entity8 ) with a female investigator , who posed as an aunt asking about the procedure for her nieces			1
the practice , which in its most extreme form can involve the almost complete sewing up of a girl 's vagina , has been illegal in the @entity18 since 1985			1
dr @entity0 denied offering to assist in arranging female genital mutilation , and was released without charge by police following an investigation			1
however , a fitness to practise panel at the @entity25 in @entity26 today ruled that he had offered to help the undercover reporter , and will now consider whether he should be allowed to continue to work as a doctor			1
dr @entity0 , who has private clinics in @entity29 and @entity30 , north @entity31 , was targeted in an undercover @entity33 sting masterminded by ' @entity34 ' @entity34 in april 2012			2
the @entity36 national was filmed discussing the barbaric procedure on a camera hidden in the handbag of an unknown female investigator			1
posing as a patient ' ms a ' , the reporter told the gp she wanted her two fictional nieces , aged 10 and 13 , circumcised during a visit from @entity47			0
the @entity48 made it an offence to carry out the procedure on a @entity18 female anywhere in the world			1
@entity0 was arrested along with @entity29 dentist @entity54 in may 2012 following the publication of the story on the investigation in the @entity33			0
both were released without charge , but @entity54 was struck off by the @entity60 last year after he was found to have offered to perform circumcision on the girls			1
@entity0 , who denied the charges , is now facing the same fate after the fitness to practise panel ruled against him today			1
' the panel decided that the recordings indicate that dr @entity0 initially considered doing the operations himself , ' said chairman dr @entity70			2
' even if dr @entity0 did not understand the @entity73 word ' nieces ' he quickly established the ages and genders of the children to whom ms @entity77 was referring			2
' he then described an @entity8 procedure by drawing a diagram , which he referred to as a pharaonic cut [ the most extreme form of @entity8 ]			2
' dr @entity70 added : ' it is clear that dr @entity0 knew that all fgm operations are illegal in the @entity18 by the references he made to this fact in the consultation and by the comments of it being ' dangerous ' with the possibility of going to jail			1
' at no point in the consultation did he raise the issue of safeguarding children or any objections on his part to @entity8			0
' he did not seek to dissuade ms a from continuing with her plans and only suggested that it would be safer ( in the sense of not being illegal ) for her to go abroad to have the operation carried out			2
' the panel saw video footage from two consultations at @entity0 ' @entity29 clinic as well as the transcript from a phone call made by the journalist			0
@entity109 : dr @entity0 , who has private clinics in @entity29 and @entity30 , north @entity31 , was targeted in an undercover sting in april 2012 sometimes called female circumcision , female genitial mutilation ( @entity8 ) refers to procedures that intentionally alter or cause injury to the female genital organs for non-medical reasons			1
the practice , described by charity @entity121 as an ' abuse of human , women ’s and child rights ' , is illegal in the @entity18			1
however , it has been estimated that more than 20,000 girls under the age of 15 are at risk in @entity18 every year , and that 66,000 women in the @entity18 are living with the consequences of @entity8			1
the true figure is unknown due to the ' hidden ' nature of the crime			0
@entity8 is usually carried out on young girls between infancy and age 15 , most commonly before puberty starts , and many are taken overseas to undergo the procedure			2
it is illegal to arrange for a child to be taken abroad for @entity8			2
if caught , offenders face a large fine and a prison sentence of up to 14 years			2
often @entity8 is carried out by women with no medical training using knives , scissors , or even pieces of glass , while anaesthetics and antiseptic treatments are not generally used			0
there are four main types of @entity8 : @entity154 , where all or part of the clitoris is removed , excision , where all or part or all of the clitoris and the inner labia are removed , infibulation , which is the narrowing of the vaginal opening , and other harmful procedures such as pricking , piercing , cutting , scraping and burning the area			0
there are no health benefits to @entity8			0
removing and damaging healthy and normal female genital tissue interferes with the natural functions of girls ' and women 's bodies , causing pain , bleeding , risk of infection and even death			0
@entity8 is carried out for cultural , religious and social reasons within families and communities , and is often considered a necessary part of raising a girl properly , and as a way to prepare her for adulthood and marriage			0
@entity8 is often motivated by the belief that it is beneficial for the girl or woman			0
many communities believe it will reduce a woman 's libido and discourage sexual activity before marriage			0
source : @entity199 when asked about the procedure , sometimes referred to as ' cutting ' , he can be heard to say : ' ah yes			2
' at one point he also said : ' a girl			0
' during their meetings @entity0 offered to assist the investigator in her efforts to have two girls circumcised and said he knew a doctor in @entity29 who could help			1
he told her it was a very short procedure , lasting less than ten minutes , as well as explaining the potential psychological problems and risks if the girls talked to friends or teachers			0
at times the doctor seems reluctant to discuss performing the operation and warns the reporter of the legal ramifications if caught			1
he said : ' in @entity224 , @entity36 - my country - it 's no problem , but here they talk too much , ' adding : ' i think it 's best you go to @entity229			0
' between 12 april 2012 and 19 april 2012 in meetings and during a telephone conversation with a reporter working for the @entity33 you : a. offered to assist in arranging an operation within the @entity18 to effect the genital mutilation of a female child or children knowing that such an operation was illegal in the @entity18 ; proved b. provided information relating to a person whom you knew or believed could arrange or undertake such an operation which you knew to be illegal in the @entity18 ; proved c. gave advice to the journalist as to the arrangement of such an operation outside the @entity18 in order to assist her or another to avoid @entity18 legislation banning such a practice within the @entity18 ; proved d. offered to provide medication to facilitate such an operation outside the @entity18 in order to assist her or another to avoid @entity18 legislation banning such a practice within the @entity18			1
proved when @entity34 phoned @entity0 on april 21 to put the allegations to the doctor he denied offering to assist in @entity8			1
he continued to deny the claims in interviews with police after he was arrested on 4 may 2012 and said he thought the reporter was referring to boys when she said nieces			0
during the hearing , @entity0 , whose first language is @entity267 , claimed he had been ' entrapped ' by the journalist and had thought he was discussing a legal @entity8 ' reversal ' procedure or circumcision on boys			1
he failed to mount a full defence case when he walked out of the hearing after splitting with his legal team and losing a string of legal challenges to halt proceedings , claiming he had racked up around £ 250,000 in legal fees since the allegations emerged			0
the panel found his version of events was ' not credible or reliable ' and that the recordings show he quickly established they were talking about females			0
' dr @entity0 ' own account of the tone of the consultation with ms a appears to be at odds with what is seen and heard in the video footage , ' said dr @entity70			0
the panel will now decide if his fitness to practise is impaired due to misconduct before considering what sanction to impose			1
@entity8 is most common among some @entity229 , @entity300 and @entity301 communities and it is thought at least 66,000 girls and women in the @entity18 are believed to be victims of @entity8			1
the term @entity8 applies to a range of procedures that alter the female genitals for non-medical reasons , the most serious of which is the almost complete sewing up of the vagina			0
although the practice has been banned in the @entity18 since 1985 no successful prosecutions have been brought under @entity18 law , although two men face trial for @entity8 offences in january next year			2
dr @entity318 , 31 , is accused of carrying out the procedure on a woman after she gave birth at @entity322 in @entity323 , north @entity31 , on 24 november 2012			2
the alleged victim 's husband , @entity324 , 40 , will also face trial for allegedly encouraging fgm restoration			0
