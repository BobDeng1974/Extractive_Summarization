by @entity0 published : 13:40 est , 29 july 2012 updated : 04:18 est , 30 july 2012 brave : @entity4 has just become the youngest ever ' @entity3 ' organ donor in @entity5 risking your own life for a complete stranger is a tough decision at any age			1
but at the tender age of 20 , it is even more remarkable			0
but that is exactly what @entity4 has just done - to become the youngest ever ' @entity3 ' organ donor in @entity5			1
this month the banking administrator had an operation to remove one of his kidneys - which will now go to a complete stranger			0
the brave decision by mr @entity4 , from @entity22 , was taken despite his mother expressing her concerns and admitting that she does not completely understand what motivated him			1
speaking to @entity27 , he said the first person he spoke to about his decision thought he was too young and should wait a while			2
' by the time i had done all the research ... i thought " i am quite mature for my age , what difference is a few years going to make ? " ' if there are people on the waiting list who are in quite a bad way ... what is the reason for waiting a few years ? ' when he applied to become a donor , doctors did not express concerns about his age			0
his believes this is because he had carried out thorough research into the procedure			0
but one person who did raise serious concerns was his mother , @entity49 , who said she was apprehensive about the operation			1
' i 'm extremely proud of him but part of me thinks ' at what point in your life as a young man do you wake up and think that this is what you want to do ? ' she says that when he asked her what she thought , she told him she did n't want him to do it			0
however , she did admit that if her son needed a kidney , she would hope there was somebody like mr @entity4 who was willing to donate one			2
mr @entity4 's inspiration behind his bold decision came following voluntary work for a charity helping children in @entity73			1
generous : because of mr @entity4 's decision , another person will now benefit from his kidney after having a bad day from seeing children suffering from abuse and people living in dreadful conditions , he decided there must be something he could do to help			1
mr @entity4 does not know who has received his kidney or whether he will ever see them in the future			2
on a blog which he writes , called @entity87 , my journey to save a life , he said : ' i 'm just an average person , no amazing talents , no special abilities , just a motive to help			0
' the previous youngest @entity3 living kidney donor was 25 .			0

@entity4 took the decision despite his mother expressing her concerns
