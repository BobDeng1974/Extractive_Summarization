by @entity1 reporter backing : western nations have admitted to @entity4 opposition they do n't want to remove president @entity5 from power for fear @entity9 militants will takeover western nations have admitted to the @entity4 opposition that they can not remove president @entity5 from power as it would risk @entity9 militants taking control of the war - torn country			1
officials revealed it will likely be essential to keep @entity5 's @entity18 minority in any transitional administration			2
the message , delivered to senior members of the @entity22 at a meeting of the @entity25 alliance in @entity26 last week , was prompted by rise of @entity28 and other militant groups			1
they have taken over a border crossing and arms depots near @entity33 belonging to the moderate @entity34 , the sources told @entity36			0
' our @entity38 friends made it clear in @entity26 that @entity5 can not be allowed to go now because they think chaos and an @entity9 militant takeover would ensue , ' said one senior member of the @entity22 who is close to officials from @entity45			1
noting the possibility of @entity5 holding a presidential election when his term formally ends next year , the @entity22 member added : ' some do not even seem to mind if he runs again next year , forgetting he gassed his own people			1
' the shift in @entity38 priorities , particularly the @entity53 and @entity54 , from removing @entity5 towards combating @entity9 militants is causing divisions within international powers backing the nearly three - year - old revolt , according to diplomats and senior members of the coalition			1
like @entity53 president @entity65 's rejection of air strikes against @entity25 in september after he accused @entity5 's forces of using poison gas , such a diplomatic compromise on a transition could narrow @entity38 differences with @entity70 , which has blocked @entity72 action against @entity5 , but also widen a gap in approach with the rebels ' allies in the @entity77			1
conflict : much of @entity25 , including @entity79 pictured yesterday , has been left in ruins as a result of the three - year revolt against @entity5 ongoing conflict : western nations are said to be concerned at the rise in activity among @entity9 militants in the country the civil war pits @entity5 and many @entity18 , backed by @entity90 and its @entity92 allies , against @entity94 rebels supported by @entity33 , @entity95 and @entity96			1
unlike in @entity95 in 2011 , the @entity38 has ruled out military intervention , leaving militant @entity98 including @entity28 affiliates to emerge as the most formidable rebel force , raising alarm among @entity102 and its allies that @entity25 , which borders @entity104 and @entity105 , has become a centre for global jihad			0
@entity45 and @entity33 , however , believe that tackling militants is less of a priority , with @entity94 power @entity110 in particular furious at what it considers @entity53 appeasement of @entity5 and his @entity90 @entity92 backers			1
@entity110 sent only a junior diplomat to the @entity25 meeting in @entity26			0
also signalling differences with @entity102 , opposition activists in @entity25 have said that @entity33 has let a weapons consignment cross into @entity25 to the @entity122 , the rebel group that overran the @entity124 border crossing last week , seizing arms and @entity38 equipment supplied to @entity127			0
peace talks are due to start in @entity129 on january 22			0
the @entity22 has agreed to go to the talks while insisting on @entity5 's immediate removal , but a @entity77 diplomat said opposition leaders should be ' more creative ' in their tactics - notably in agreeing to take part in transitional arrangements that would leave @entity5 's fellow @entity18 in key positions			2
destruction : buildings shown reduced to rubble in @entity79 yesterday after an alleged airstrike with explosive barrels from forces loyal to president @entity5 free @entity4 army members remove a body from rubble after an airstrike in the @entity147 in @entity79 yesterday ' for @entity150 to produce an arrangement acceptable to the @entity53 and @entity70 , the opposition would have to accept taking part in a transitional administration with a strong @entity18 presence , ' the diplomat said			1
' @entity5 may or may not stay as president but at least he will have diminished powers			2
' if the opposition rejects such a deal , they will lose most of the @entity38 and only have @entity45 , @entity95 and @entity33 left on their side			0
' a second member of the @entity4 opposition , who is in touch with @entity53 officials , said @entity102 and @entity70 appeared to be working in tandem on a transitional framework in which @entity18 would retain their dominant role in the army and security apparatus to assure their community against retribution and to rally a unified fight against @entity28 with moderate rebel brigades , who would be invited to join a restructured military			2
he criticised @entity53 and @entity178 officials for continuing to indulge in rhetoric that @entity5 has no future role to play in @entity25 , without spelling out how his rule will come to an end			1
' even if @entity5 is sidelined and a @entity94 heads a transitional authority , he would have no power because neither @entity102 nor @entity185 appears to want to end the @entity18 control over the military and security apparatus , ' he said			2
still at war : members of @entity9 @entity4 rebel group @entity191 take pictures of damaged buildings in the @entity147 in @entity79 free @entity4 army members fix damage caused by an airstrike in @entity79			0
peace talks are due to begin in january a senior @entity38 official said that @entity70 and the @entity53 have discussed which government officials - and up to what level of seniority - could be retained in a transitional phase but that they had not agreed any fixed blueprint			2
a declaration last week by the 11 leading @entity38 and @entity77 countries opposed to @entity5 blamed the @entity4 leader 's military crackdown for the rise of @entity9 militants but said the opposition must uphold democratic values			1
islamists ' undermine the @entity150 ... process and threaten @entity25 's territorial integrity as well as international and regional security , ' the @entity211 said in a statement			0
@entity217 , a former @entity4 intelligence official who defected to the rebels two years ago and is in contact with @entity53 and @entity70 officials , said @entity185 wanted an @entity18 to lead the military in any transition			0
' @entity70 is not sticking to @entity5 but the red line for @entity185 is the preservation of the @entity4 army , ' he said			0
' it realises that , with five decades ' experience in the army and security , the @entity18 are best placed to fight @entity9 militants			1
' the political solution has to be gradual and involve a collegiate leadership			0
if @entity18 are assured that there will be no retribution against their lives and property they would accept that @entity5 and the first line of his lieutenants leave			0
' residents look for survivors at a damaged site after an airstrike by forces loyal to @entity25 's president @entity5 in @entity246 area of @entity79 heavy death toll : it is believed more than 70 people died in the airstrike on @entity79			0

western nations believe losing @entity5 could result in a militant takeover
diplomats from @entity54 and the @entity53 are said to be more concerned with combating @entity9 militants than removing @entity5 from power
this is causing divisions with other countries who backed the three - year revolt against him
the claim was made at an @entity267 alliance meeting
