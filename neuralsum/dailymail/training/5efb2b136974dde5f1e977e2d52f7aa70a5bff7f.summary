by @entity0 published : 17:42 est , 17 december 2012 updated : 17:42 est , 17 december 2012 two billionaire @entity2 brothers have quietly collected more than 177,000 acres of @entity5 ranch land in the last two years close to the @entity6			1
but that 's only a portion of the property that @entity10 , 60 , and @entity11 , 56 , have accumulated in @entity5			1
in all , they own more than 276,000 acres in seven counties in the eastern half of the state			2
that 's 431 square miles , more than half the size of @entity18			2
owning such large amounts of land puts them in the big league of @entity5 landowners			1
@entity23 , owned by former media mogul @entity24 , has 149,000 acres in @entity5 holdings			1
big spenders : @entity27 and his brother @entity28 ( right ) are buying up great tracks of @entity5 ranch land it was announced last week that @entity32 , a billionaire who is married to a @entity34 heir , bought the 124,000 - acre @entity35 near @entity36 that had been listed for $ 132 million			1
according to @entity37 , @entity32 also owns the @entity38 near @entity39 and the @entity40 near @entity41			2
the @entity43 ' presence has n't gone unnoticed , especially in @entity44 where they 've purchased 79,000 acres from ten landowners in the last two years			2
the brothers ' biggest acquisition was the fabled 62,000 - acre @entity49 , for $ 45 million			1
that deal made national news last year , partly because the property was then owned by software billionaire @entity53			1
another landowner the @entity11 brothers have bought out is @entity56 , who had a log lodge , timber and grazing land between the south and north forks of @entity62			1
they also bought property from the @entity65 , owned by @entity66 of @entity67			2
@entity37 quoted @entity68 , of @entity69 , as saying the brothers like to spend their spare time hunting and fly fishing with friends , family and corporate guests , and that their ranch properties are used for farming , ranching and wildlife management			1
buying up big county : the @entity80 in central @entity5 for $ 45million this summer , the brothers hosted a barbecue at the @entity80 headquarters , inviting the locals to eat , drink and chat			1
' they seem to be really nice folks to me , down - home and friendly , ' said @entity88 , who owns ranch land at the east and west edges of the @entity80 on @entity62			2
he went to the barbecue and talked to the brothers			1
' both of them were very cordial , ' he said			2
@entity28 and @entity27 did not respond to a request for an interview with @entity95			2
@entity28 and @entity27 were raised in a working - class family			2
they started out in a masonry business that their father founded and where they still sit on the board of directors			2
in 2002 they branched out into the oil business , starting a company called @entity106 their fortune came from selling their interest in @entity109 in 2011 , a deal that was reportedly worth $ 3.2 billion			1
that sale landed them on the @entity37 list of little - known billionaires , ranking 312 out of 400 on the list			2
their background in fracking - a way to recover oil by injecting fluids underground under high pressure - has made some @entity5 suspicious that the brothers are looking for their next oil play in central @entity5			1
another possibility is that they - like other wealthy individuals - are parking their money in a safe investment during a volatile time in the stock market			1
@entity131 : despite their million - dollar land purchases , the brother 's own less than 1 per cent of @entity5 's vast land @entity5 is 147,200 sq miles in size - meaning despite the @entity11 brothers ' significant land purchase , it is still less than 1 per cent of the state			1
if their acquisitions were simply for ranching and outdoor recreation , the @entity11 brothers have a wide choice of where to go			1
they also are reported to have purchased land in @entity148 , @entity149 , @entity2 and @entity150			0
in @entity151 , @entity27 is said to have paid $ 16 million in june for the most expensive ski - accessible home in @entity154 - a seven - bedroom home on five acres in the ski town			0
getting to their properties scattered across the @entity158 is no problem			0
when the brothers visit @entity5 , their 18 - passenger @entity162 corporate jet lands at the @entity165 airport , where they hop into a helicopter to fly to the @entity80			1
pretty soon , though , the stop in @entity165 wo n't be necessary			0
the brothers this summer began building a 6,000 - foot asphalt airstrip on a bluff across @entity62 from the @entity80 headquarters			1
besides a possible energy play , another rumor floating around @entity44 is that the @entity11 brothers are looking to get rid of isolated @entity175 inholdings through land exchanges			1
@entity177 , field manager for the @entity175 's @entity178 , said the agency is open to any proposals , but is quick to add that any propositions would have to go through public scrutiny			0
' we have to make absolutely certain it 's in the public 's best interest , ' @entity177 said			1
the @entity175 owns about 2,500 acres in the @entity187 that are landlocked within the @entity80 with no road access			0
' if we could trade that for another place we could gain some access , ' @entity177 said			0
' that would be worth consideration			0
' @entity177 said some pilots fly to the inholding to hunt			0
when one pilot wrecked his plane , he had to hire a helicopter to remove the damaged aircraft because there was no road access			0
here 's how the @entity11 brothers land purchases stack up , according to the state @entity203			1
the majority of their land buys have been in @entity44 , some of them adjacent to the @entity80			0
in @entity44 they have bought 79,000 acres			0
to the south in @entity212 , they bought the @entity213 from @entity66 's @entity65 , which added another 64,000 acres			0
in @entity216 , to the west of @entity212 , 34,800 acres of property has been purchased by the @entity11			1
most of the land deals in those three counties were located fairly close together , but the @entity43 have also purchased land farther away			0
in @entity221 , they bought 15,200 acres between the @entity222 and @entity224 mountain ranges near the popular @entity225 and adjoining the @entity227 and @entity228 national forests on two sides			0
up north , they bought 22,800 acres near the @entity231 in @entity232			0
@entity234 of @entity235 , they bought 48,300 acres in @entity236 , and in @entity238 east of @entity239 they purchased 12,000 acres near the @entity240			0
all of the land deals have been recorded within the last two years			0
@entity242 , whose 44,500 - acre family ranch north of @entity244 is for sale for $ 21.6 million , said his family has talked to the @entity11 brothers about their property			1
but the family had initially sought a conservation easement from the state that would have preserved public hunting access and prevented development of the ranch			0
that deal fell through recently as the state moved to purchase land along the @entity257			0
the ranch was founded by @entity242 's great - grandparents in 1884			0
' the family is officially wanting to start a new chapter , ' @entity242 said			0
' beyond that , how that chapter comes about remains to be seen			0
' @entity242 said he has some fears about the acquisition of smaller family farms by a large conglomerate , ' especially when your lifestyle is based on so much history and tradition '			0
but @entity88 , the @entity43 ' neighbor at the @entity80 , has no problem with the many land acquisitions by his new neighbors and sees the brothers as more friendly and open than the previous owner			1
' i figured that was their business , ' he said of the land buys and rumors of fracking plans			2
' if they 're buying up land , they can do what they want with it			0

@entity10 , 60 , and @entity11 , 56 , made their money in oil
some @entity5 suspicious that the brothers have interest in fracking
