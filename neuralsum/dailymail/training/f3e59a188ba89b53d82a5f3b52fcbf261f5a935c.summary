big day : @entity6 ( @entity27 ) at her friends @entity29 ( r )			1
@entity6 has been bridesmaid at 13 weddings but is still looking for a love of her own party gal : @entity6 attends a party wearing the bridesmaid dress she wore to her sister @entity36 's wedding film star : @entity3 as @entity39 in the 2008 film 27 dresses , where she , like real life @entity6 , was always the bridesmaid but never the bride @entity6 was first called upon for bridesmaid duty when she was 18 and did the honours for three high school friends ; @entity47 , @entity48 and @entity49			1
after she graduated university in 2007 she was asked to walk down the aisle ahead of two friends @entity53 and @entity54 and her two sisters @entity56 and @entity36			1
and since 2008 she ’s been a bridesmaid six more times in as many years for friends , her college roommate , and a fellow blogger for a lifestyle website she contributes to			1
while @entity6 , who works with adults with special needs for the @entity64 , has never been a bride herself , she ’s still hoping her big day will come			2
happy : @entity6 , top right , as a bridesmaid at her friend @entity53 's wedding			1
@entity6 has been to 13 hen dos , been in 13 sets of pictures and sat through 13 sets of speeches never the bride : @entity6 , left , walks down the aisle at the wedding of her friend @entity77			1
@entity3 played a fictional character @entity39 , right , in 27 dresses who was a bridesmaid numerous times but remained single she was engaged four and a half years ago and since the relationship ended she has remained single , but she says she ’ll never get bored of supporting people on their big day , as well as the rest of their marriage			1
' i ’ve been a bridesmaid so many times but the buzz is still the same when i ’m asked , ' she says			1
' it ’s such an honour to be invited to be part of someone ’s wedding that i ca n’t help but say yes			0
' although it ’s common for people to get married quite young where i live , i have n’t lost hope			0
' i definitely want to get married and have children one day			0
' until then i just feel so blessed to have been part of so many special days ! ' congratulations ! @entity97 ) at her friend @entity98 's wedding			0
' i 've been a bridesmaid so many times but the buzz is still the same when i 'm asked , ' she says sitting pretty : @entity6 ( @entity103 ) at her friend @entity105			1
since she was 18 @entity6 , now 31 , has been a bridesmaid 13 times amongst the traditional white dress church weddings , @entity6 as worn a black gown , carried a parasol instead of flowers and boogied the night away at a 1980s themed rehearsal dinner			1
at one wedding the bridal party even pulled @entity115 poses at the altar			0
unsurprisingly , the odd dress - disaster inevitably cropped up during two of the 13 nuptials			0
one bride tried to be kind by picking a value - for - money dress that suited four bridesmaids , but with its grey - green tinge and high necked @entity126 - style collar that reached @entity6 ’s ears , it ended up far from flattering			2
at her own sister ’s wedding , a suspect seamstress in charge of alterations did such a bad job , the perfect dresses that had been handmade for each bridesmaid ended up sticking out in all the wrong places			0
these aside , @entity6 has lovingly hung onto six of the dresses - and even wears them for parties now			2
sister love : @entity6 ( @entity27 ) at her sister @entity36 's wedding			2
@entity6 says : ' i feel so blessed to have been part of so many special days ' rock n roll : @entity146 ) at her friend @entity147 's wedding			2

' it 's such an honour to be invited to be part of someone 's wedding that i ca n't help but say yes , ' she says but unlike @entity3 in the 2008 film , she ’s never had to dash between two weddings in one evening - or been forced to plan the wedding of her crush to someone else			0
' as much as i love that film i ’m not sure about all the things [ @entity3 's character @entity39 ] does , ' says @entity6			2
' unlike @entity39 i ’ve been really good friends of all the people i ’ve been a bridesmaid for			2
they ’ve wanted me to support them in their marriage , not just organise their big day ! ' all the weddings i ’ve been in have been about the people not just a big white dress and a cake			0
' i love weddings , they ’re great to meet people and bring people together , but if it ’s just about the party then it loses the attraction for me			0
' it has to be about celebrating lasting love			0
' she adds : ' i really have been very fortunate with the dresses - there ’s only been one that was a bit of a shocker			0
and in hindsight even that was n’t so bad			0
