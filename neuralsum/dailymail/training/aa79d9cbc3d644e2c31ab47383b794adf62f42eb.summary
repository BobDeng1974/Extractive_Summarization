by @entity0 snakes are sneaky creatures that can be found almost anywhere			2
from the freezing @entity5 to the planet ’s arid deserts , these animals are talented travellers			0
now space scientists are planning to use this talent to explore a much tougher location - the hostile surface of @entity13			0
a team from the @entity16 research institute in @entity17 , @entity18 , is studying how snake robots could be used to gather samples from hard - to - reach places on the red planet			2
one idea is to use a conventional rover , such as @entity37 , to carry the robot snake over large distances and then deploy it to places the rover ca n’t access			1
so far , @entity42 has landed four rovers on @entity13			2
these are solar - powered robots with six wheels and robotic arms that can take soil samples and operate cameras			0
@entity49 landed in 1997 , @entity50 in 2003 , while the more advanced @entity37 was landed last summer			0
one idea put forward by the @entity16 researchers ( pictured ) is to use a conventional rover , such as @entity37 , to carry the robot snake over large distances and then deploy it to places the rover can ¿ t access ‘ @entity61 is a challenge			1
the spirit rover was lost after it became stuck in the sand on @entity13 , ’ said @entity58 and @entity59 at @entity60			0
‘ the vehicles just can not get to many of the places from which samples have to be taken			0
’ at the moment , soil samples from @entity13 are analysed on board the rover itself , and the results are sent back to @entity73			0
even moving at light speed , results from @entity13 take about 20 minutes to reach the surface of @entity73			0
@entity31 also wants to explore options that could allow samples to be returned to @entity73 for more detailed analysis , which an extra terrestrial snake robot may help achieve			1
the group have already developed @entity83 , an experimental snake robot , to study snake robot motion across flat surfaces			1
the robot consists of 10 identical joint modules , each having two motorised degrees of freedom			0
the modules are covered by passive wheels to give the robot ground friction , which enables it to slither forward over flat surfaces			0
‘ we are looking at several alternatives to enable a rover and a robot to work together , ’ said mr @entity94			1
‘ since the rover has a powerful energy source , it can provide the snake robot with power through a cable extending between the rover and the robot			1
‘ if the robot had to use its own batteries , it would run out of power and we would lose it			0
’ ‘ one option is to make the robot into one of the vehicle 's arms , with the ability to disconnect and reconnect itself , so that it can be lowered to the ground , where it can crawl about independently			1
' the researchers envisage a cable connecting the robot to the vehicle to supply power and communication signals and also help winch it back in			2
the researchers envisage a cable connecting the robot to the vehicle to supply power and communication signals and also help winch back the snake into the rover ‘ the connection between the robot and the rover also means that the snake robot will be able to assist the vehicle if the latter gets stuck ’ , said mr @entity58			1
‘ in such a situation , the robot could lower itself to the ground and coil itself around a rock enabling the rover to pull itself loose by means of the cable winch , which the rover would normally use to pull the snake robot towards the rover			1
’ another option would be for the robot to be located underneath or on top of the rover			2
this would require a hoisting mechanism to pick up the robot , lift it up and connect it to the rover			2
the researchers , who are working with @entity148 ( @entity149 in @entity150 ) and @entity151 ( the @entity152 ) , plan to publish a detailed report on the extra-terrestrial snake robot in december .			1

the work is part of a study by @entity31 to *overcome* rovers ' *current* *limitations*
one idea is to use a rover to carry the robot snakes over large distances
another is to make the snake robot into one of the vehicle 's arms , with the ability to disconnect and reconnect itself
