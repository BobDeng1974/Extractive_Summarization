by @entity0 a dangerously ill teenage boy was told he had an anxiety disorder and depression for more than a year before doctors finally realised he was actually suffering from liver failure			1
shockingly , @entity6 , 16 , only received an accurate diagnosis after he was rushed to hospital suffering from acute liver failure with yellow eyes and bloody urine			1
by the time he was finally found to have liver failure , he was dangerously ill and had to have a life - saving transplant within a week of his diagnosis			1
@entity6 , 16 , was told for more than a year that he had depression and anxiety before doctors eventually realised that he actually had liver failure			1
he is pictured with his sister just days before his diagnosis his mother , @entity19 , 47 , from @entity20 , told @entity21 : ‘ the speed of it was mind - blowing – to go in seven days from him being okay and having “ depression ” to getting a new liver			1
‘ but , it was good to know there was a reason he was feeling so awful			0
’ when @entity6 was 13 he started to show signs of depression			1
he started to vomit in the mornings and not to want to go to school			2
he had recently lost his grandmother and moved house and school so his mother and doctors thought he was suffering from depression			0
his condition gradually got worse until he was missing a lot of school and was often too ill to get out of bed			0
ms @entity19 , a primary school teacher , said : ‘ he would get so upset before school he would be sick			0
he was in an awful state and he was just not engaging with life			0
’ @entity6 saw a counsellor and was then prescribed antidepressants which finally caused his condition to improve slightly			1
@entity6 was only diagnosed when he turned yellow and had to be placed in an induced coma in hospital while waiting for an emergency liver transplant @entity6 ( pictured with his mother , @entity51 ) now knows that his depression and anxiety were caused by his underlying liver condition which meant copper was building up in his body his mother said : ‘ he was so desperate to be better and it seemed to improve			1
we thought we had finally cracked it			0
’ ms @entity19 says that , at this point , she believed her son was suffering from depression and anxiety as it never crossed her mind that there could be another underlying cause for his illness			2
however , everything changed just after @entity6 finished school for the year in july 2012			1
during the first week of the holidays the family went on a caravan holiday			0
ms @entity19 says that before they left she noticed that @entity6 ’s stomach was slightly swollen but that she did not think a lot of it			2
@entity81 's disease is a disorder which causes the body to have higher than normal levels of copper			1
an overload of copper is poisonous and can cause damage to the liver , brain and other organs			1
the copper overload is caused by a genetic defect that prevents the liver from being able to metabolise copper			2
if @entity81 's disease is diagnosed early enough it can be treated effectively			1
but , if it is not treated , it is always fatal			0
the build up of copper in the liver causes cirrhosis and eventually liver failure			2
in the brain , it can lead to confusion , tremors and clumsiness			0
it can also cause personality changes , anxiety , depression , psychosis and suicidal thoughts			1
in extreme cases , patients may require a life - saving liver transplant			1
source : @entity120 @entity119 she told @entity21 : ‘ it was the sort of thing only a mother would notice			0
i did n’t think much of it but as his mum i noticed it			0
’ she explained that a few days later , he was very sick and vomited repeatedly but that she was not overly concerned because he had a history of being sick in the mornings so it was not particularly unusual			0
however , when he returned from the holiday his eyes started to turn yellow			1
ms @entity19 took him straight to the doctors where a urine sample was taken and she was horrified to see that it was red with blood			0
the next day he had blood tests and was sent straight to @entity20 and @entity141			0
doctors at the local hospital were so worried that they had him transferred to @entity144 , in @entity145 , within hours of arriving			2
ms @entity19 says that once they arrived at @entity146 , doctors spent 24 hours attempting to establish what was wrong with @entity6 before eventually diagnosing him with @entity81 ’s disease			1

ms @entity19 said : ‘ when we were given the diagnosis and looked up the condition it suddenly all clicked and everything made sense			0
’ since his transplant , @entity6 ( pictured with his mother , @entity51 ) has made a full recovery and is running triathlons she was told @entity6 would need an emergency liver transplant and as he was becoming delirious he was put in an induced coma			1
incredibly , because he was put on a super-urgent transplant list , he was given a transplant just 48 hours later			2
his mother said : ‘ we feel blessed that he got a liver			0
it ’s the ultimate gift and he would n’t have survived otherwise			0
‘ his condition was critical – he was being kept alive by machines			0
’ she added : ‘ we were lucky in a way as we never lived with @entity81 ’s disease and he now no longer has it because the transplant was effectively a cure			1
‘ it has all worked out of the best really – although losing your own liver is traumatic he was lucky not to have to live with the disease			2
@entity6 ( pictured before his illness ) no longer has @entity81 's disease as the transplant acted as a cure ‘ now i just feel sad that he has missed out on a normal teenage - hood			1
’ @entity6 spent a month at @entity144 before he was well enough to be transferred back to his local hospital			1
while he was in @entity145 his parents were offered accommodation close to the hospital by @entity221			0
the house has 24 en - suite bedrooms as well as a kitchen and garden and it offers free accommodation to the families of children being treated at @entity144			2
it can provide accommodation for any length of time – some parents say just for a few days while others stay for a year			0
ms @entity19 said : ‘ they were fantastic – they provided a room in the hospital and then they provided a little flat			0
ms @entity19 says she is not angry at @entity6 's misdiagnosis but that she is just sad that he missed out on having a normal teenage - hood			1
@entity6 is pictured ( right ) before his illness with his brother , @entity240 ‘ it was so important – it gave us a home in @entity145			2
’ @entity6 is now much better – he has to take anti-rejection medication but he has taken part in a triathlon and is at college			2
ms @entity19 told @entity21 : ‘ he is trying to build - up his fitness now			1
‘ the illness has made him a different person – since the operation he is much happier and a nicer person to do things with			0
‘ hopefully that is because his body is no longer poisoning itself so he feels better			0
