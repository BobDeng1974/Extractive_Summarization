the @entity1 is rehiring more than 50 staff a month who have been given redundancy pay - outs , it can be revealed			1
in just eight months the number of managers who have returned after being paid off leapt by 10 per cent to 4,300			0
the revelation will reignite the row over the revolving door of highly - paid administrators handed golden goodbyes worth thousands of pounds before walking straight into another role			0
health secretary @entity13 argues the @entity1 reforms have saved £ 1.5billion a year , despite thousands of people given payouts returning to work in the health service under @entity1 rules staff must only wait four weeks after taking redundancy before they can move to a new job			1
last month the @entity22 announced it would claw back payments under future redundancy programmes , but staff will be able to keep the cash if they wait for a year before taking up a new post			1
it has previously been claimed that more than one in six managers and administrators given payouts worth as much as £ 650,000 are now back working in the health service			1
more than 21,000 staff were made redundant under the coalition 's controversial health reforms , which saw primary care trusts axed and replaced with @entity38 - led commission groups			0
each time an update has been published about the numbers returning to the @entity1 , the government has insisted it is getting a grip on the programme			1
however , ministers have admitted the numbers have risen again , including 2,502 in permanent roles and 1,870 on fixed - term contracts			0
@entity48 frontbencher @entity47 , who obtained the figures , said : ' this revolving door is further evidence of the chaos and waste @entity55 's @entity1 reorganisation has created			1
' the health service is on its knees under the @entity58			0
only @entity48 will save our nhs			1
' the taxpayer has paid more than £ 2million buying smartphones and @entity62 for bureaucrats in new @entity1 quangos			1
thousands of iphones and tablet computers have been bought for staff at @entity68 and @entity69 , set up under the coalition 's reforms to save money for the health service			0
data released by health minister @entity75 shows that @entity68 and @entity69 , both formed last year , were the biggest spenders on @entity62 and iphones			0
@entity68 bought 115 @entity62 and 400 iphones in the year before it was officially launched in april 2013 , and since then has bought another 150 @entity62 and 1,900 ipads			0
the quango 's total bill comes to £ 1.2million			0
@entity69 , also formed last year , has spent a total of £ 530,000 on 2,036 iphones and £ 113,743 on 65 @entity62			0
in response to a parliamentary question , health minister @entity75 said : ' the number of @entity1 staff estimated to have been made redundant since may 2010 and subsequently , up until july 2014 , re-employed by an @entity1 organisation on a permanent basis is 2,502 and a fixed term contract basis is 1,870			1
' @entity48 's shadow health secretary @entity92 said : ' this scandalous waste of money can not be justified when cancer patients are waiting longer for treatment			1
' nurses denied a modest pay rise will find it galling to see @entity55 's been handing out cheques like confetti to people who have now been rehired			1
' on his watch , we have seen pay - offs for managers and pay cuts for nurses			0
' @entity55 's top - down re-organisation has wasted £ 3 billion and left the @entity1 in a weak financial position			1
nurses are paying the price for his mismanagement of the @entity1			1
' the figure has risen by 422 to 4,372 since an update for november 2013			2
the total cost to the @entity1 of ' revolving door ' payments has not been revealed but with the average redundancy payment being £ 48,000 , it could mean more than £ 200million has been squandered on pay - offs for returning staff since 2010			1
the @entity122 says its ' bureaucracy - busting reforms ' are saving £ 1.5billion a year , with 13,500 more frontline staff and 7,000 fewer managers in the @entity1 since may 2010			2
a @entity127 source said the ' big redundancy bills are down to @entity48 rules and @entity48 contracts - negotiated with @entity48 's union friends '			1
under new rules announced by the @entity22 last month , the law will be changed so that anyone earning more than £ 100,000 who returns to the same part of public sector within 12 months of taking redundancy will have to return all or part of their pay - off			1
it is expected the measure - which is included in the @entity144 currently going through @entity145 - will mainly affect @entity1 and local government administrators			2
the @entity22 said that of the 19,000 @entity1 administrators made redundant between 2010 and 2013 , almost 20 per cent rejoined the @entity1 while 16 per cent of local government chief executives who left by mutual agreement between 2007 and 2009 had been employed by another council within a year			2
almost all of the public sector will be covered by the measures , including the @entity154 , local government and the @entity1			2
@entity156 chief secretary to the treasury @entity157 said : ' it 's only fair that highly - paid executives who receive a redundancy pay - out from the public purse and then quickly return to the same part of the public sector repay the taxpayer			2
' reforming the public sector so it works for @entity166 has been a key part of this government 's drive to create a stronger economy and fairer society			0
' family affair : @entity174 and husband @entity173 received six - figure pay - offs from @entity1 trusts but both got jobs at @entity179 among the staff paid off on huge sums before returning were a husband - and - wife team of @entity1 managers who walked away with £ 1million in combined redundancies straight into six - figure salary posts			2
@entity174 , 50 , pocketed more than £ 605,000 when @entity186 of @entity187 , where she was chief executive , was wound up at the end of march 2013			0
her husband @entity173 , chief executive of @entity190 of @entity187 , was paid more than £ 345,000 when his organisation was abolished			0
by june last year both had board - level jobs at @entity179 – mr @entity173 as interim chief executive , miss @entity174 as recovery director			0
today it emerged the couple earned a total of £ 120,000 while in the temporary management posts at hospitals in @entity202 , @entity203			0
@entity204 , political director at the @entity205 , said : ' this is yet another outrageous example of the ' revolving door ' culture in the @entity1 , which hits taxpayers twice - once in the form of pay - offs and then again in the form of new salaries			2
' this is exactly the sort of bad management and lack of foresight we simply can not afford in the public sector , particularly at a time when hard - pressed families are having to budget to make ends meet			0

*exclusive* from november to july 422 people given payouts were rehired
1 in 5 people given redundancy payments are now back in the @entity1
@entity48 says it is proof of the ' chaos and waste ' @entity1 reorganisation
