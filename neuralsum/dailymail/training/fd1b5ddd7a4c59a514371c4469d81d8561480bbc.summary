by @entity0 @entity1 , one of @entity3 ’s most celebrated authors , has donated the handwritten manuscripts of her novels to @entity7 ’s @entity6 in order to stop them leaving the country			1
miss @entity1 ’s gifting of the material puts her at odds with writers such as @entity15 and @entity16 , who sold their archives to overseas libraries and universities which easily outbid their cash - strapped @entity3 counterparts			2
miss @entity1 , 70 , said : ‘ it is up to people whether they sell it or give it away but i very much wanted the papers to stay in @entity27			1
miss @entity1 , left , fifth - generation niece of playwight @entity29 , right , wants to keep works in @entity27 ‘ i am @entity27 , the novels are @entity27 and as a nation we still read a vast amount of fiction ... the fact is @entity3 institutions struggle when these things are put up for sale			1
’ in recent years the @entity41 , in particular , has seen off the @entity42 to snap up prized papers including those of playwright sir @entity45			0
experts say that institutions around the world would have bid for the archive and it could have attracted a price tag of £ 100,000			0
miss @entity1 , whose works include @entity52 and @entity53 , said the collection had sparked an ‘ amicable tussle ’ between the @entity42 and the @entity6			1
miss @entity1 used the @entity6 as a student at @entity7 in the 1960s			1
she said : ‘ i know people let their material go to @entity60 but i wanted my archive to go to somewhere personal to me			0
’ @entity1 has donated the manuscripts to the @entity6 , where she used to study her donation contains the manuscripts to all 30 of her novels , as well as her extensive research for each book , including anonymous interviews with the people who inspired her characters			1
@entity71 , director of library services or ‘ @entity73 ’ , said he hoped other writers would follow @entity1 ’s lead			2
he added : ‘ we are delighted that @entity1 is gifting her archive to the @entity6			1
she is one of the most successful novelists of her generation and as somebody who graduated in @entity27 literature at @entity7 we are immensely proud of her success as a writer			1
’ and @entity85 chairman @entity84 said : ‘ manuscripts of our literary heritage are our nation ’s dna : @entity1 ’s gift is important and very generous			1
’ miss @entity1 said she can spend up to two years working on a book			2
‘ the research is a big deal for me			0
i am trying to get across the authenticity of the people i am writing about and i do n’t want the reader to be tripped up by mistakes in the background			0
’ she worked at the @entity99 prior to becoming a full - time writer in 1980 and has already sent 50 boxes of material to the @entity6 , which was established in 1602			2
sir @entity16 , left , and sir @entity45 , right , are high profile writers whose manuscripts are abroad in the past five years miss @entity1 has written five books and has promised to donate material relating to all her future novels			1
she still pens all her novels by hand , saying : ‘ i write newspaper articles and speeches on a computer but when i am writing a novel , i still do it by hand			0
i just need the silence of writing a novel because i am kind of describing a movie i can hear and see in my head			0
’ the author , who is a fifth - generation niece of the @entity121 novelist @entity29 , hopes her own technique will help anyone studying the material to realise literary success does not come overnight			2
she said : ‘ i write on the right hand of the page and i leave the left hand blank and that is where i make my notes and alterations			0
i hope people who study the manuscripts will be able to see how the novels are evolving			1
’ miss @entity1 added that she is ‘ appalled ’ by the closure of local libraries , which she insists still have a role to play			0
she said : ‘ what they symbolise as well as what they are is ever more important			0
in this increasingly digitised world they represent something solid and safe in communities			0
‘ in the old days we went into a church for sanctuary and i think librarians are going to represent that sort of sanctuary in the future			0

@entity1 has given her manuscripts to @entity7 *'s* @entity6
she made the move to ensure the works stay in @entity27
the novelist hopes her *originals* will show people how the novels evolved
