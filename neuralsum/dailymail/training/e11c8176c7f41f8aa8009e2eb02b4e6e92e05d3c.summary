@entity0 has accused @entity1 of using a 6,000 - strong cyber army to launch attacks on its military and government , as well as targeting organisations overseas			1
@entity10 may now be able to hit the @entity12 mainland with nuclear warheads thanks to advances in rocket technology and efforts to minimise the radioactive bombs , @entity9 's defence ministry said			1
the warning comes after days of rising tensions on the @entity21 peninsula after @entity1 said he was open to ' high level ' talks with the @entity0 during his @entity25 speech			2
the revised estimate comes after @entity1 's regime was blamed for hacking movie producer @entity42 in retaliation for making film @entity46 , depicting the assassination of @entity1			1
in the days following the leaking of confidential @entity42 information , the @entity0 said it had foiled an attempt to hack its nuclear reactors , again blaming the attack on the @entity10			1
last week @entity0 it experts said they had removed a ' worm ' - a type of virus spread via email or file - sharing that is able to replicate itself - from one of their systems			0
@entity63 said that a ' small amount ' of non-critical data was stolen , but that no threat was found in the computer network controlling its reactors			0
in his @entity25 address , @entity1 said he was willing to engage in talks with the @entity0 at the ' highest level ' , but only if conditions were met			2
among those conditions were agreements for the @entity0 to stop undermining his regime , and to cease all joint military exercises with the @entity12 in the waters around @entity10			1
the report is likely to raise tensions on the already fraught @entity80 , even after @entity0 president @entity81 said she was open to ' high level ' talks with the @entity85 while @entity0 president @entity81 has come out in favour of talks , she has refused to end the military drills , and this new report could scupper any hopes of restarting diplomacy			0
@entity0 campaigners are also trying their best to prevent any talks from taking place , launching balloons over the border carrying messages which are critical of @entity1 's leadership			2
the letters were enough to derail the peace process last time , and prompted a short exchange of heavy machine gun fire as troops from the @entity10 attempted to shoot them down			0
the @entity85 , which has described the activists as ' human scum ' , has repeatedly asked for the balloons to be banned			0
the @entity0 has refused , but urged protesters to ' show restraint ' instead			0
fresh @entity12 sanctions , which came into force at the start of the year following the @entity42 hack , have also meant that relations between the two @entity113 have been strained			1
while the asset freezes , which target 10 @entity10 government officials and three organizations , will likely have little direct impact on the regime , they are a very public rebuke for an attack that the @entity10 has consistently denied .			0

@entity0 says @entity1 has twice as many hackers as previously thought
@entity125 comes in wake of @entity42 hack and attack on @entity0 's nuclear plants
@entity1 regime may also be able to hit @entity12 with nukes thanks to new rockets
