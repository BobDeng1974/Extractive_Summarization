@entity0 believes @entity2 's game is lacking identity and thinks he should question his coaching relationship with @entity5			1
in an @entity7 of ridiculously one - sided matches there has been no more crushing defeat than the one handed to @entity2 by @entity10 on thursday			1
@entity2 was fortunate simply to win a game against a player he has frequently beaten in the past			2
@entity2 looks on in anguish after a night to forget against the @entity16 master @entity10 the world no 2 came out all guns blazing and won the opening six games in just 24 minutes on thursday night it was a dispiriting way to end a tough season and former @entity24 @entity23 , a good friend of @entity2 's , was frustrated by his lack of aggression			1
' when you reflect on the match , for me his game had no identity , ' said the 40 - year - old @entity34 pundit			2
' what was the plan out there ? it was really the @entity10 show			2
' @entity10 played fantastically well , but , for @entity2 to have an impact , he has to be proactive , and the thing that is always exciting about @entity2 is there 's no shot in tennis that he ca n't hit			1
' if he 's got all these shots in his armoury , my question is why does n't he use them ? ' he has to look at the way that he can be more offensive and more proactive instead of letting these players dictate to him			0
he 's got as good a two - handed backhand as @entity52 , but he does n't use it as much			0
i 'd be looking for him to really crunch the ball			0
the 27 - year - old had to win in straight sets to progress but he failed to win a single game in the first set @entity0 believes @entity2 's game is lacking identity under his current coach @entity5 ' this is about him making his opponents do the running			1
he 's a great athlete , but he does too much running and , when he 's doing too much running , he 's not dictating enough			0
' it 's about clarity of thought and that 's when you 've got to take a step back and look at the whole set - up , the whole team and his whole lifestyle and see whether that is working as well as it can			0
at the end of the day , he 's the only one that can answer that			0
' @entity2 turned to @entity5 in a ground - breaking partnership after @entity83 brought an end to their hugely successful association in march			1
the @entity87 appeared to have turned a corner after the @entity89 when he won three tournaments in five weeks , saving a combined 10 match points in two finals against @entity93			2
@entity2 was applauded for his fighting spirit , but @entity0 did not see the matches as a positive			1
of the @entity5 partnership , he said : ' i have n't seen them practise but , to me , i do n't think he has been playing the right way			0
' he had those ' fantastic matches ' against @entity93 - and @entity93 is someone who is absolutely maximising his potential and he 's had a great career - but @entity2 's in a different class to him			1
' @entity2 should be dominating him and beating him 6 - 3 6 - 3			0
three hours and 20 minutes on an indoor court ? something 's wrong			0
' because @entity2 's such a good player , he 's capable of winning the wrong way			1
it 's a great asset , but , when you come up against the very best guys , you ca n't just turn it on			0
he 's got to play the right way all the time			0
' the chastening straight sets defeat brought the curtain down on @entity2 's 2014 campaign @entity2 and @entity5 have not had much chance to work together away from tournaments yet and the off - season should give the @entity121 the opportunity to have a greater impact on his game			1
@entity2 has said the success or otherwise of their association should not be judged until the @entity128 and it is certain to be under intense scrutiny in @entity131			0
despite his disappointment with @entity2 's performances , @entity0 thinks he can turn things around in time for the new season			1
the former world no 4 , who agrees with @entity138 that @entity2 should take a break rather than get straight back on to the practice court , said : ' the great thing about @entity2 is he 's his own harshest critic			2
' he sets the bar high			0
we 're questioning where he 's at and he 's qualified for the @entity7 , which is an incredible achievement			2
' so you have to keep perspective , but @entity2 's career right now is about contending at majors and , having had the disappointment of the last match of the year , i think it could be a great catalyst for next year			1
' so does @entity0 expect @entity2 to be challenging for the @entity128 title ? ' absolutely ; 100 per cent			2

@entity2 *crashed* out of the @entity7 in @entity156 on thursday night after *losing* in straight sets to @entity10
it capped a disappointing season for the @entity24 no 1
@entity0 says @entity2 's game is lacking identity currently
the former @entity24 no 1 says the @entity87 should be questioning his coaching relationship with @entity5
