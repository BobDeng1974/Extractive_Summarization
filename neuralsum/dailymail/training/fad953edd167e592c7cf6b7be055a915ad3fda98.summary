by @entity0 a couple who raised £ 60,000 to save their baby son from a life of silence have spoken of their joy after he reacted to sound for the first time			1
@entity9 was born without vital nerves in his ears - meaning he was profoundly deaf and could not benefit from even the most advanced hearing aids			1
his parents @entity14 and @entity15 were told by doctors their only hope was to send @entity9 for an expensive operation at a leading clinic in @entity20 , @entity21			1
but they had just six months to come up with the cash or it would be too late			0
@entity9 was born profoundly deaf and could not benefit from even the most advanced hearing aids			1
thanks to pioneering surgery he can now hear basic sounds hope : thanks to donors , the couple raised the £ 60,000 they needed to take @entity9 to @entity21 for pioneering surgery			1
there , surgeons fitted him with a special electronic device to stimulate his brain stem when the device - known as an auditory brainstem implant - was switched on , @entity9 instantly reacted to the sound of a banging drum scientists believe the procedure is largely ineffective on children over the age of two because their brains have already adapted to total deafness			1
thanks to donors - including a £ 30,000 mystery donation - the couple raised the money in time , giving the go - ahead for surgeons to fit 19 - month - old @entity9 with a special electronic device to stimulate his brain stem			1
last month they were able to travel to the @entity54 so @entity9 could be operated on by top surgeon @entity55 , whose research helped develop the groundbreaking procedure			2
@entity9 's family was thrilled when the device - known as an auditory brainstem implant - was switched on and @entity9 instantly reacted to the sound of a banging drum			1
mrs @entity63 , 37 , from @entity64 , said : ' it has been a real race against time to raise this money and we 're just so relieved we 've managed to do it			0
' it was very emotional when the implant was switched on and @entity9 reacted to the sound of the drum			1
' both @entity15 and i promised each other that we would try not to cry and we just about managed to hold it together			0
' we 've been on quite a journey and we both know that if we 'd waited just a few more months it could have been a different story as it might not have worked			0
' it is a long road ahead and we still need to raise thousands more for all the speech therapy he 'll need			0
' but we 've now been told that by the age of five , his hearing should be at the stage where he 'll be able to have conversations on the phone			1
' he 'll be able to go to a mainstream school , which is something we never thought would have been possible before			0
' we 're absolutely overwhelmed by the generosity of people who have donated and fundraised and we want to have a big party to say thanks to them - they 've given us the best gift ever			0
' doctors discovered @entity9 was deaf four months after his birth in july 2011 but reassured his parents he would be able to hear with the help of hearing aids			1
@entity9 ( with sister @entity103 ) now faces years of speech therapy , but doctors are confident he will still be able to learn to communicate normally but mrs @entity63 and her husband , a 29 - year - old dental technician , were devastated when tests revealed @entity9 's auditory nerves were missing completely and that surgery was his only hope			1
they were offered a date for the operation last year but had to turn it down because they had n't raised enough money			0
mrs @entity63 , a full - time mother to @entity9 and his five - year - old sister @entity103 , added : ' we were devastated when we first found out what was wrong with @entity9			2
' the thought of your child never being able to hear or speak is heartbreaking - all you want is for them to say " mummy " and " daddy "			2
' when we heard about the operation , we knew we could never afford it but we had to do everything we could for @entity9			2
' it was so hard to have to turn down the first operation date but getting the £ 30,000 donation was just amazing , although we do n't know who it was from			2
' @entity9 's mother @entity14 said she was ' absolutely overwhelmed ' by the generosity of people who have donated and fundraised @entity9 underwent surgery on february 26th and the auditory brainstem implant was activated on march 26th			1
he now has a total of 12 electrodes in his brain , which will help him to interpret sound			0
he faces years of speech therapy but doctors are confident that he will still be able to learn to communicate normally and could be holding full conversations before he reaches school age			1
mrs @entity63 said : ' it sounds so silly , but i used to worry so much that @entity9 would n't be able to go to the pub with his friends when he turned 18 because he would n't be able to hear anything			2
i just feel so relieved that he wo n't be so left out			0
' we just want to thank everyone who has helped us get to this stage			0
' to donate to @entity9 's fund visit @entity155 an auditory brainstem implant ( @entity158 ) is a small device that is surgically implanted in the brain of a deaf person whose auditory nerves are lacking or damaged			1
the auditory nerves conduct the sound signals from the ear to the brain			2
the implant enables otherwise deaf people to have a sensation of hearing			0
the auditory brainstem implant consists of a small electrode applied to the brainstem ( the part that joins the spinal cord ) , small microphone on the outer ear , and a speech processor			0
the electrode stimulates vital acoustic nerves by means of electrical signals and the speech processor digitally transmits the sound signals to a decoding chip placed under the skin			0
a small wire connects the chip to the implanted electrode attached to the brainstem			0
depending on the sounds , the electrode delivers different stimuli to the brainstem , making deaf people hear a variety of sounds			2

@entity9 was born profoundly deaf *due* to missing nerves in his ear
doctors said his only hope was pioneering surgery in @entity21 that cost £ 60,000
involves fitting a special electronic device to stimulate the brain stem
surgery was a *success* and @entity9 could immediately hear a banging drum
by age five , he should be able to hear conversations on the phone
