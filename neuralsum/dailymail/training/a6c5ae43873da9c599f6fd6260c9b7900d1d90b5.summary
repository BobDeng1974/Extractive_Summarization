@entity4 will be closed on @entity6 and will wait to open until *9am* on *black* friday , it has announced
the chain is part of a *counter-movement* among stores ***refusing*** to open over the holidays
@entity5 is another big name ***refusing*** to open
@entity10 's and @entity11 ’s are among the stores who started opening on @entity6 - ***refusing*** to wait until @entity14 to start their sales
early sales allow the stores to cash in but it means shop workers lose out on the time off
