by @entity0 published : 17:31 est , 27 september 2012 updated : 10:15 est , 28 september 2012 a new law being introduced to protect teachers from malicious allegations of crimes against pupils could have hindered the hunt for @entity7 and @entity8			1
the @entity9 , which comes into force next week , gives anonymity to teachers accused of committing criminal offences against children at their school			1
the law was introduced amid fears over a number of false allegations of abuse or physical assault made by pupils and parents against teachers in recent years			1
@entity25 : but under legislation to be introduced next week it might have been illegal to have named 15 - year - old @entity7 ( left ) who fled to @entity28 with her teacher @entity8 but the controversial legislation – enforced by fines of up to £ 5,000 – could have unintended implications in future cases similar to the hunt for missing @entity7			1
under @entity36 , anonymity ends only if the teacher is charged with a criminal offence or a court agrees to an application that it is in the interests of the justice that it should be lifted			0
anonymity also ends if an arrest warrant is issued , but in @entity7 ’s case that did n’t happen until tuesday – four days after her disappearance was reported to police			1
the 15 - year - old boarded a @entity50 ferry with mr @entity8 last thursday night meaning , under the new law , that a crucial amount of time could have been lost the 15 - year - old boarded a @entity50 ferry with mr @entity8 last thursday night meaning , under the new law , that a crucial amount of time could have been lost before publicly appealing for help in tracking them down			0
under the legislation , it might be illegal to have even named @entity7 or her school because by doing so it could lead to the identification of her teacher			1
critics say the @entity67 could also mean that an accused teacher might move from one school to another without allegations being properly recorded and aired if there is not a criminal charge			2
during the @entity67 ’s passage concerned peers in the @entity76 described the new anonymity law as ‘ an unprecedented attack on free speech ’ and as the hunt for @entity7 intensified yesterday media organisations warned of the legislation ’s ‘ unintended consequences ’			1
the @entity84 , which promotes the interests of @entity87 ’s regional and local media , was among organisations lobbying against the new law			0
@entity89 , executive director of the @entity90 , said : ‘ in trying to protect teachers from being falsely accused you are actually putting children at greater risk			2
here they are trying to deal with one problem , teachers being falsely accused , by creating another			2
that is the law of unintended consequences			0
’ the @entity9 2011 comes into force on monday and means that teachers become the first group of people in @entity87 legal history to be given automatic anonymity when they are accused of a criminal offence			1
the @entity90 , in a letter to peers , warned that the measures would be a ‘ gross inhibition on freedom of speech ’ , adding : ‘ it would set a very dangerous precedent as people could be convicted for telling the truth			0
’ mr @entity89 warned : ‘ it will be a criminal offence for anyone – pupil , parent , police , school , local authority , whistle - blower , media – even to inform parents or the general public that an identified teacher has admitted that the allegation is true and has resigned , has been disciplined , or even cautioned for the offence			0
’ missing : schoolgirl @entity7 , 15 , fled to @entity28 with her 30 - year - old maths teacher he added : ‘ although we acknowledge teachers ’ fears about false accusations , the most important issue is surely to protect children			2
‘ malicious allegations by pupils are extremely rare and alongside this , the laws of libel , contempt and confidence already restrict newspapers from repeating and publishing unsubstantiated accusations			0
’ under the act , anonymity can also end if the @entity143 publishes information about the teacher in connection with an investigation or decision in a disciplinary case			0
the teacher may also waive his or her anonymity .			0

the @entity9 comes into force next week
gives anonymity to teachers accused of crimes against pupils
the legislation might have made it illegal to have named @entity7 or school
