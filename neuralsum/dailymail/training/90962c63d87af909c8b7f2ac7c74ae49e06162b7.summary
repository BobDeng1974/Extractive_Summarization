by @entity0 ministers will today backtrack on controversial plans that would have wiped up to £ 70,000 off the gold - plated pensions of private - sector staff			1
there was outrage last november when the government suggested ways for bosses to cut the cost of paying defined - benefit pensions to their workers			1
one of the damaging effects would have been to stop the pensions rising with inflation			0
ministers will today backtrack on controversial plans that would have wiped up to £ 70,000 off the gold - plated pensions of private - sector staff the proposed changes could also have made staff wait longer for their pensions and stopped schemes paying out to their spouses when they died			1
but the @entity23 , which is being published today , shows the government has made a u-turn and scrapped the plans			2
the decision will be a relief for millions of private - sector workers who are still lucky enough to be building up a defined - benefit pension in their job			1
public - sector staff , who have been called the ‘ pensions aristocracy ’ , would not have been affected by the changes			1
defined - benefits schemes , such as final - salary pensions that guarantee to pay a percentage of a worker ’s salary on retirement , were once popular but are rapidly disappearing			2
the number of private - sector workers actively contributing to them has plunged from more than five million in 1995 to 1.7million today			1
when the government revealed its proposals last year to encourage bosses to include more employees in the schemes , pensions minister @entity42 said he hoped they would trigger ‘ a renaissance ’ in final - salary pensions			2
but the @entity23 , which is being published today , shows the government has made a u-turn and scrapped the plans			2
the decision will be a relief for millions of private - sector workers who are still lucky enough to be building up a defined - benefit pension in their job the most explosive change would have been the rule that allowed firms to freeze workers ’ pensions after they retired			1
annual pension increases are vital if retirees are to protect their payouts from being eroded by the rising cost of living			0
at present , a boss must increase payouts by at least 2.5 per cent a year			0
if this had been axed , the impact would have been devastating			0
for example , a retired worker receiving a pension of £ 10,000 a year would receive £ 320,000 over 25 years once the increases were included			0
but without the annual rises , the retiree would get only £ 250,000 – a loss of £ 70,000			0
@entity79 , of financial advisers @entity80 , warned that the plan would ‘ pull the rug ’ from under workers at the last minute			0
last night , a spokesman for the @entity85 said a consultation had revealed there was no appetite for the changes			0
he added : ‘ we have concluded that introducing legislation to make it easier to sponsor defined - benefit schemes will not be our priority at the present time			1
