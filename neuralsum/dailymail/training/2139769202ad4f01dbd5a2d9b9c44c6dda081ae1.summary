by @entity0 published : 05:26 est , 17 october 2013 updated : 08:18 est , 17 october 2013 many humans worry about finding their first grey hairs , but for one type of baby monkey , a distinguished grey coat replaces its fiery fur before it has its first birthday			2
one wildlife photographer has captured the transformation of an adorable baby silver - leaf langur as its fur changes from vivid orange to grown up grey in central @entity14			1
there are a number of theories as to why the creatures are born with such bright fur and they include keeping them safe from predators , stopping them getting separated from their mothers and even sending out a signal to the rest of the troop that they should start to think about childcare duties			2
the young animals ' fur begins to change to grey starting with its head so that for a short period of time it looks quite strange with only its body a bright orange			1
adult monkeys have grey - tipped black fur that gives them a uniform silvery appearance as well as a distinctive crest of fur that runs along the top of their head and tufts of hair on their cheeks that obscure their ears			0
the baby langurs are born with orange fur and turn to silver at approximately three months of age , although some can begin their transformation aged just one month , according to @entity68 , a senior keeper at the @entity69			1
writing on the zoo 's blog , she said there are three main theories as to why the animals are born bright orange			1
it is thought that the baby langur 's vivid fur makes it easy for their mother to find them , as the young monkeys love to explore			0
baby silver - leaf langurs are born with orange fur and turn to silver at approximately three months of age , starting with their heads ( pictured left ) , although some can begin their transformation aged just one month			1
their fur gradually becomes darker ( pictured right ) until their bodies turn grey too according to the keeper , the babies are intrepid and can venture a little too far from their mothers , but their fur allows them to be found easily			2
another theory is that their orange colour helps the babies blend into their surroundings			0
' it seems hard to believe that bright orange could be used as camouflage , unless maybe the orange would make them appear as a bright - colored flower on a tree			2
most predators are colour blind and can not tell the difference between orange and green , ' she said			0
here , the young silver - leaf langur has almost lost its orange fur - although it is still possible to see some patches on its back another theory is their orange colouring makes it obvious that there is a baby monkey in the troop so other adults should start to share the care of the infant			1
' a baby langur can wear a mother out , so having a troop full of babysitters allows her to rest			0
the babysitters can also relieve the mother so she can get something to eat , ' wrote ms @entity68			0
silver - leaf langurs live in coastal and mangrove forests in @entity14 , @entity137 and @entity138 and travel in groups of between nine and 40 individuals , with one adult male and a group of females caring for the babies of the troop			1
they rarely leave the trees , which keep them largely safe from ground - dwelling predators such as leopards and tigers			0
during the day they travel around 500 metres - some in all female sub groups - but congregate in a single tree to sleep over night			0
female silver - leaf langurs typically give birth once every 18 months to two years and a female attract a mate by shaking her head from side to side			1
females give birth to a single baby after a gestation period of between 181 and 200 days and the babies are born measuring around 20 centimetres with a strong grip so they can cling to their mother			0
there are three main theories about why baby silver - leaf langur 's are born with bright orange fur ( pictured ) but one is that it makes it easier for its mother to find when the infant goes exploring in the forest			1
females look after the baby animals collectively while the baby 's fur rapidly changes colour from orange to grey , it does not reach the adult pattern for three to five months after birth			2
the creatures are classified as ' near threatened ' as their natural habitats are being destroyed by logging and the development of oil plantations , while people also hunt them for meat and keep them as pets .			0
