instead of having increased body confidence , it is the fact a woman has spent money on herself that gives her a boost in the bedroom , says @entity12 , a professor of psychology at @entity14			1
' when we have exerted a great effort , spent a great deal of money and effort and time on something , we tend to justify that effort , ' she said			1
' our good feeling is increased because of the effort , not the thing itself			1
' women who get breast implants do have improved sex lives - but not for the reason they might think , a psychologist has claimed			1
instead of having increased body confidence , it is the fact a woman has spent money on herself that gives her a boost in the bedroom professor @entity12 was speaking following a study by @entity37 researchers which found that women experienced a significant boost to their arousal and sexual satisfaction following the procedure			1
the study involved 45 women who planned to undergo breast implant surgery			1
researcher dr. @entity45 and colleagues asked the women to fill out a questionnaire before the surgery that assessed their sexual desire , arousal and sexual satisfaction			2
patients were then asked to retake the questionnaire at two , four and 18 months after surgery			0
nine women with stretch marks following their plastic surgery did not report any improvement			2
stretch marks can occur if the implant is significantly larger than the original breast was , according to the @entity62			0
but the 36 women who did not develop stretch marks after surgery said they had experienced improved levels of arousal and were more satisfied with their sex lives			2
they reported this improvement at both four and 18 months following surgery			0
commenting on the findings , professor @entity12 said : ' here are 45 women who spent a great deal of time and money and effort augmenting their breasts because the media has clearly convinced them their breasts are inadequate.so we should n't be surprised they are pleased with the breast augmentation			1
' but other experts argue post-surgery confidence in the bedroom is because a woman now feels that her outward body now fits her inward persona professor @entity12 , who is also a member of the @entity88 's task force on the sexualisation of girls , added she was n't surprised that women felt more attractive in the bedroom after surgery			1
' feminine heterosexuality is very much about our sense of whether or not we are pleasing our partner , and here we have 45 women who have spent a great deal of money to that purpose			2
' f these breasts are now pleasing to their male partners , then they are likely to feel more sexually attractive			0
' there are a lot of other things breasts are a part of			0
this is an indication that in our @entity111 culture , breasts are for men			0
they are for men 's pleasure , ' she said			0
but dr @entity118 , chair of the public education committee of the @entity62 ( @entity62 ) , disagrees			0
' when i see patients and follow up , a lot of them will say " my husband and i or my boyfriend and i are having a lot of fun "			0
' why not ? it 's an important part of life , ' he said			0
' i think that the female breast is a very important part of a woman 's body , in terms of how a woman feels about herself in public , how her clothes fit and how she feels about herself sexually			2
' it 's very common for a woman post-surgery to say she feels more confident , that her outward body now fits her inward persona			2
' ' [ the study ] found that in the areas of both sexual satisfaction and sexual arousal , there were significantly increased feelings , ' said these aspects of the sexual experience were increased for these women			1
' the findings are to be presented this week at the @entity62 annual meeting in @entity157 .			0

rather than increased body confidence , it is the fact a woman has spent money on herself that gives her a boost in the bedroom , says professor
' our good feeling is increased because of the effort , not the thing itself , ' says psychologist @entity12
