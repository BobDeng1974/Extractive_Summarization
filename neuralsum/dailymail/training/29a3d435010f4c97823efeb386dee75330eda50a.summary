a young woman branded vain for wanting a lump on her throat removed says being stubborn saved her life - after the growth turned out to be cancerous			1
@entity6 was later told she had been suffering with the disease in her thyroid - a gland in the neck - for at least a decade			1
but her requests for diagnosis and treatment had repeatedly fallen on deaf ears , with medics blaming hormones and even hypochondria			2
when she finally succeeded in getting surgery , doctors discovered it was cancerous miss @entity6 was later told she had been suffering with the disease in her thyroid - a gland in the neck - for at least a decade she told @entity29 : ' doctors laughed in my face , called me vain and said it could be removed - but it would be classed as plastic surgery			1
' but you know your own body and when something is n't right and i refused to give up			1
' it is purely my own stubbornness that saved my life			0
' miss @entity6 , originally from @entity41 but now living in @entity42 , first noticed the growth when she was 18			1
' i woke up one morning and noticed a huge lump on my throat			2
i got worried and started investigating what it was			0
' while it was n't painful , it was more than 3cm in size			1
it later began pressing on my vocal cords and i began to sound quite hoarse			0
' but despite making multiple medical appointments , her concerns were dismissed by different doctors in @entity41			1
' as i was young , otherwise healthy - and did not have a troubled medical past or any illnesses in my family - they simply would not take me seriously , ' she recalled			1
' one doctor even told me it was very common for young , hormonal women to have lumps on their throat , and that i should come back in two years time if it had n't disappeared " naturally "			1
miss @entity6 ( pictured after surgery ) first noticed the growth when she was 18			1
' while it was n't painful , it was more than 3cm in size			1
it later began pressing on my vocal cords and i began to sound quite hoarse ' ' but i insisted it was wrong for a young a woman to have a large , unexplainable lump on her throat , and that my intuition told me something was n't right			1
' i felt like i had something foreign in my body			2
i did n't care what it was , i just wanted it gone			2
' one doctor it told me it could be done , but it would be " purely out of vanity " , ' she said			2
determined not to be fobbed off , she convinced doctors to perform a biopsy - but even then this was performed incorrectly and the results came back negative			1
' all along , from most doctors i saw ( which were a lot of different ones ) i was treated as a young naive hypochondriac who did n't know her own body as i was too inexperienced with life , ' she said			1
eventually , miss @entity6 , now 26 , found another doctor who agreed to remove the growth			1
' but he added it would be classified as cosmetic surgery			1
' all along it was treated as completely harmless and benign			0
' after the lump was removed , tests revealed miss @entity6 was suffering from papillary thyroid cancer - the most common form of the disease which tends to strike women and younger people it was only when the lump was sent off for testing - a standard protocol for any growth removed - that the devastating truth emerged			1
the so - called benign lump was actually thyroid cancer - and miss @entity6 had most likely had the disease for a decade			1
she said : i could n't believe what i was hearing			2
it was a very traumatic situation , not helped by the doctor being very matter of fact			0
papillary thyroid cancer is the most common type of thyroid cancer			1
about 6 out of 10 thyroid cancers diagnosed are papillary			2
this type is more common in women and in younger people			0
it is usually slow growing			0
but it can sometimes spread to lymph nodes in the neck or near by			0
most people with papillary thyroid cancer have no symptoms in the early stages of the disease			1
you may notice a lump in your neck			2
some people may have a hoarse voice or difficulty in swallowing			0
this can be due to pressure from the cancer in the throat			0
very occasionally , the cancer can cause a noisy type of breathing called stridor			0
some people feel very tired and as though they have no energy or strength			0

' tests revealed miss @entity6 was suffering from papillary thyroid cancer - the most common form of the disease which tends to strike women and younger people			1
usually slow growing , it can spread to lymph nodes in the neck or near by			0
while the disease often has no symptoms in the early stages , a lump , tiredness and a hoarse voice are common signs			1
looking back , miss @entity6 says she had suffered with many of these , but due to having the disease for so long , they had become ' normal '			1
' i had gone from the age of eight to 18 feeling tired and depressed , so i just thought it was normal to feel like this			0
' it is only now , in retrospect , that i can see that i had depression for several years before i found the lump , and this is a common effect of thyroid illnesses			1
' surgeons confirmed she would need a second round of surgery to totally remove her thyroid - followed by radioactive iodine treatment			1
given the size of the tumour , and the growth speed of the cancer type , the surgeon estimated it began growing when she was eight years old			2
she is now dependent on medication for the rest of her life to get thyroxine , the hormone produced by the thyroid gland			2
she said having cancer as a young person was ' horrible for so many reasons '			1
' you have to having to deal with a a serious illness at a time of your life when things are already hard , ' she said			0
' you are disbelieved by the only people who can help you and should take things seriously ' eighteen months after discovering the lump , she got the all - clear and decided to take control of her life			2
' i felt that life was too short , so i packed my bags and moved to @entity42 where i had always dreamed of living			0
' i built up a new life from scratch , began studying and moved on to work for one of the largest accounting firms , where i am currently working and studying for my professional qualifications			0
' looking back at my experience , my first advice for young people dealing with cancer , or believing that you may be affected , is to stand your ground			2
' if you feel that something is wrong , dare to say so and demand the treatment you are entitled to			0
' you know your body better than anyone else and even if somebody is telling you that certain symptoms are " normal " , you know your body best			2
' i know this is easier said than done , but if i had n't done so i might have either been scared off by the " cosmetic surgery " comment from the incompetent doctor , or i had waited a few years before looking into it again - and it may have been too late			1
' miss @entity6 is supporting @entity20 ’s @entity248 this friday miss @entity6 said having cancer as a young person was ' horrible for so many reasons '			1
she told @entity29 : ' you have to having to deal with a a serious illness at a time of your life when things are already hard			0
you are disbelieved by the only people who can help you and should take things seriously			0
' for thyroid cancer patients , there can be a depression caused by the unidentified thyroid problems			1
' on top of this , once being diagnosed , there is the feeling you have to be an adult and be strong , not showing any signs of weakness , i have never felt so lonely and unsupported as when i had cancer			0
' it was suggested i take antidepressants to deal with it , which i do n't feel was the right solution			0
' you do not - and should not - have to deal with it yourself			0
' i felt that if i did n't put on a brave face , no one else would cope , so instead i broke down in tears on my own and tried to handle it all myself			0
this is not right , and the consequence of this is that my process of dealing with the emotional effects of the illness were delayed			0
' there are people out there who you can speak to , who can help you through this traumatising illness			0
' as lonely as you may feel , you are not alone , there are people out there like @entity293 , and people like myself , who know what you are going through and want to listen and help			0
i wish i had known about support groups such as @entity20			0
