her brutally honest approach has attracted abuse online by those who have accused her of objectifying men			0
but it has also seen the teen flooded with offers from attractive men who believe they fit the profile			0
@entity6 was hit with a barrage of online abuse after she advertised for ' good looking as hell ' flatmate the 19 year - old decided to take the unusual approach as a ' cry for help searching for that non-existant , ideal man , ' she told the @entity31			1
ms @entity6 , who wrote the post while preparing to return to @entity4 - where flat sharing is a rarity - after working as an au pair in @entity36			1

@entity42 is absolutely no obligation !

other found the advert amusing with @entity56 commenting that the teenager was a ' hilarious lady this ! ' but the post was not a hit with everyone , after some accused the pretty teen of objectifying men			1
one post simply described the stunt as ' white trash ' while @entity68 , another member of the same apartment rental group on @entity11 , asked : ' is this some kind of social experiment ? ' the 19 year - old posted the advert on a flat - hunting @entity11 group page in @entity12 last week ms @entity6 had appealed for good - looking men who were ' charming ' and knew how to put the toilet seat down after use ms @entity6 told @entity78 : ' i 've lost count on how many messages i 've received , and am still receiving , and how many wonderful , handsome and charming men there are out there searching for company			1
' i wish them all the best to find what they 're looking for - i 'm sure they will			2
' for the rest , i pray for the ones who are constantly trying to make other people feel less worse , and hope that they see how much bigger of a problem their actions are for society			0
' i thought it was quite clear i was n't trying to outrage anyone			0
' my ad was simply just about finding someone to settle down with , being willing to make him feel as a king while he 's seducing my eyesight			0
