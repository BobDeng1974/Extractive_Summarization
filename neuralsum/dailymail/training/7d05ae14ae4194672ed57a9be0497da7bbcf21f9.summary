' inches away : the amazing encounter happened as mr @entity6 swam in the sea between the @entity40 and @entity42 islands confident : instead of darting away , mr @entity6 looked directly into the whale 's eyes and posed for the camera impressive : the @entity4 , above , is one of the fastest whales on the planet - reaching speeds of 40mph mr @entity6 had been working on a documentary about sperm whales with cameraman @entity52 , scientist @entity53 and their skipper @entity54 when they were told a @entity4 had been spotted in the area			1
with permission from the @entity8 government , they then dived into the water between the islands of @entity40 and @entity42			1
they were stunned to come within inches of the massive whale , which is part of the @entity65 species			1
' we tried to stay as calm as we could and not make any sudden or surprising movements , ' said mr @entity6			0
' the biggest surprise was that the whale showed an interest in us and chose to come very close			0
trip : mr @entity6 and fellow crew members @entity52 , @entity53 and @entity54 tracked the whale for six hours by boat - a trip that spanned 35 nautical miles			0
above , the massive creature surfaces near the diving boat ' at some points , we were face to face and eye to eye , with just a few centimetres in between			1
' the crew then tracked the whale for six hours by boat - a trip that spanned 35 nautical miles from the south coast of @entity40 to the west coast of @entity42			0
' we had to jump each time from the diving boat and into the water near the whale			0
we went down approximately 12 metres each time , ' said mr @entity6			0
' we never expected anything like this to happen			0
underwater pictures of @entity4 whales are extremely difficult to get because they are so shy and so fast			1
' these pictures are very unique - it really was a once in a lifetime experience			0
' amazing : in a separate encounter , diver @entity98 is nearly engulfed by a giant whale shark in @entity101 feeding time : wildlife photographer @entity103 and his wife swam among the 26ft creatures as they were fed thousands of tiny fish by local fisherman off the @entity110 coast in @entity111 mr @entity6 and his crew are not the only divers to have come within touching distance of a large sea predator recently			1
wildlife photographer @entity116 and his wife @entity117 were nearly swallowed up by feeding whale sharks as they dived off the @entity110 coast in @entity111 , @entity101			1
the pair had jumped into the water as the 26ft sharks - who can dive up to 1.2 miles deep - were fed thousands of tiny fish by local fisherman			2
they then swam with the predators as they drifted through the water at about five miles an hour - gobbling up the colourful fish in one go			0
open wide : the sharks drifted through the water at about five miles an hour - gobbling up the fish in one go mr @entity103 , from @entity134 , @entity21 , said it was an opportunity he ' could n't afford to miss '			1
' with its mouth wide open , the shark plowed the sea and sucked hundreds of colorful fish down its throat , ' he said			0
' it came so close to me that i had to nudge it gently so it did not push me into one the nets			0
' then two more whale sharks joined in and i had to catch my breath as the greater of the two approached			2
opportunity : mr @entity103 , from @entity134 , @entity21 , said it was ' amazing ' to be so close to the feeding sharks ' it was amazing to watch and to be that close to them			1
' @entity101 fishermen , who work through the day and night , use high - pressure sodium vapor lamps to illuminate the surface of the water - luring in plankton and other small fish			0
once thousands of fish have gathered in the water , the lights are then switched off and the harvest begins			0
whale sharks usually wait until the nets are full of fish to pounce because , according to mr @entity103 , they prefer prey that they can catch with minimal effort .			2
