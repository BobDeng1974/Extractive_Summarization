by @entity0 published : 08:49 est , 14 november 2012 updated : 11:13 est , 14 november 2012 a man uses @entity2 on an @entity3 : a security flaw has been revealed that allows hackers to seize control of accounts using their victim 's email address @entity2 was today forced to pull its password reset function after a vulnerability was revealed that allowed hackers to hijack accounts using just their victim 's email address			1
the security flaw allowed an attacker to reset the password of any @entity2 users , locking victims out of their own accounts and giving the hacker total control			1
to exploit the vulnerability , all attackers needed to know was the email address tied to their victim 's @entity2 account to persuade the @entity33 - owned service to provide a password reset token to given them access			1
the hack was first reveal on a @entity40 - language forum two months ago , @entity37 reported			1
a reporter for the tech site confirmed that the exploit was possible			0
' we reproduced the attack , step - by - step , and managed to access the @entity2 accounts of @entity37 writer ( with permission ) @entity50 ( as well as editor @entity51 to verify again ) with only their email addresses , ' @entity43 wrote			2
' essentially , that email address is used to create a new account with your own email address tied to it			0
' then , minus a couple of key steps , you can use a password reset token to gain access to your target â€™s account			2
' the site 's investigation showed that the hack then gave access to a victim 's @entity2 account , revealing the target 's username and allowing the attacker to change the password			1
once the password was changed , the hacker gained exclusive access to the account , with the victim no longer able to log in			0
the @entity37 explained that the hack works because @entity2 sends password reminders to both the account holder 's email address and , crucially , the @entity2 app itself			1
this allows a third - party to intercept the token , redeem it and claim ownership of the victim 's original username and account			0
embarrassment : @entity2 has now disabled its password reset page until the flaw can be fixed the security exploit is an embarrassment for @entity33 , last week announced it was shutting down its live messenger service and forcing users to migrate to @entity2 , which it bought last year in a massive $ 8.5billion takeover			1
once alerted to the vulnerability , @entity2 moved quickly to disable its password reset page			2
@entity2 spokesman @entity98 told @entity99 : ' early this morning we were notified of user concerns surrounding the security of the password reset feature on our website			2
this issue affected some users where multiple @entity2 accounts were registered to the same email address			0
' we suspended the password reset feature temporarily this morning as a precaution and have made updates to the password reset process today so that it is now working properly			0
' we are reaching out to a small number of users who may have been impacted to assist as necessary			0
' @entity2 is committed to providing a safe and secure communications experience to our users and we apologise for the inconvenience .			0
