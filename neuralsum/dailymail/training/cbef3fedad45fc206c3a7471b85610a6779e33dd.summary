by @entity0 published : 04:39 est , 12 november 2013 updated : 11:48 est , 12 november 2013 she 's become known for her controversial comments during her participation in debates on this morning			2
but on tuesday , @entity5 finally met her match - after facing off against @entity7 in a discussion about attachment parenting			1
despite aiming several low blows at @entity7 , including referencing a picture of @entity7 ' son @entity13 falling out of his pram while the star was on the phone , @entity5 's argument could n't stand up to @entity7 ' comments about the principles of @entity19 ' the panto witch has finally met her match ! ' @entity7 shared her joy after winning a debate on attachment parenting against @entity5 on this morning on tuesday following the incredibly heated debate , @entity7 shared a picture of herself and a very sullen - looking @entity5 on @entity27 , writing : ' i think we all know who won			1
she was quaking in her @entity33 old boots			2
the panto witch finally met her match ! ' she later added : ' just saw the @entity5 exiting the @entity36 studios with her tail between her legs and a traumatised expression on her face			1
finally ! ! ' @entity5 had earlier let rip at mother - of - two @entity7 , insisting that her decision to stick to the often controversial movement to raise sons @entity13 and @entity45 meant that she is a bad mother			1
her argument reached a new low when she referenced the now infamous picture of @entity49 falling out of his pram , saying : ' she likes attachment parenting until her baby is on the pavement			1
' heated : @entity5 and @entity7 had a very lively debate about attachment parenting defending her corner : peaches did her utmost to explain the reasons as to why she follows the principles of attachment parenting , while @entity5 contended otherwise but @entity5 's comment did n't go down too well with @entity36 hosts @entity63 and @entity64 stepped in to defend @entity7			1
@entity63 said : ' we 've all done that			0
my daughter fell out of her carry chair when i was looking after her once			0
' and @entity7 replied : ' at least i 'm there for my children and not slagging them off in the press , @entity5			1
' the lively debate began with @entity7 explaining the principles of attachment parenting to @entity64 , @entity63 and @entity5			1
almost coming to blows : peaches refused to let @entity5 speak during the debate stepping in : the pair made no secret of their out - and - out dislike of each other on the show ' whatever she says is meaningless ' : peaches labelled @entity88 ' during the show she said : ' it 's sad to me that this has a name because all it is is a return to instinctive parenting			1
i follow the 7 bs of attachment parenting - birth bonding , breastfeeding , babywearing , bedding close to baby , belief in the language value of your baby â€™s cry , beware of baby trainers and balance			1
' but @entity7 added that while the principles of @entity19 can be as loose or as strict as you like , she does have a routine with her two boys			2
she said : ' i have a routine with my child , we have a loose feeding schedule , and they have a really strict bed time because there are boundaries			0
' it 's really not about strict rules - you can pick and choose what you like about it , it 's all inclusive			0
you can really mix and match			0
' the post that started it all : @entity7 ' rage stemmed from @entity5 sharing this picture and comment about the incident which saw her son @entity13 fall out of his pram peaches was then asked about the fact that her husband @entity139 sleeps in a separate bed while she sleeps with the children			1
she said : ' with my family it 's because i have two babies under 2			0
one is 17 months and one is 7 months			0
we have a bed that is 9ft wide because when you sleep with your baby you have to be safe			0
' when pressed about how the sleeping arrangements affect her sex life , @entity7 replied : ' i have two babies under two so obviously i am doing something in the bedroom			2
hold on a minute : @entity5 was unimpressed when @entity7 jumped in with her own comments as she was speaking ' whatever she says is meaningless ' : peaches dismissed @entity5 's remarks without a second thought ' just because i sleep in bed with my babies does n't mean i 'm in bed with them 24/7			1
they go to bed at 7 , but i do n't go to bed at 7			0
we go to another bedroom in the house and watch television or do other things couples do			0
' i 'm 24 and my husband is 23 , we obviously like being intimate with each other ! ' @entity63 and @entity64 then gave @entity5 chance to chime in , with the former @entity173 star saying : ' it 's all a bit " knit your own @entity175 " for me			2
@entity19 is just one step away from @entity180 - @entity19 parenting			2
' the many faces of @entity5 : the presenter let her frustration show on her face @entity185 in hands : peaches also appeared to be finding it frustrating when @entity5 would n't listen to her points at least she 's making herself laugh : @entity5 aimed several low blows at @entity7 during the debate but @entity7 was unwilling to let @entity5 speak , insisting : ' whatever you say is meaningless ' , before adding to @entity63 and @entity64 : ' she 's just a rent - a - gob			1
' given another chance to step in on the debate , @entity5 said : ' i think it 's really important that mums are mums and that they are in control			1
@entity19 parents thinks it 's important that you 're there straight away if the baby cries , ' but i think it 's important to see that as a mother you put you baby down to sleep and if they want to cry , then they should go for it			0
' on the issue of baby wearing , which sees mothers hold their children close to them via a sling , @entity5 said : ' i wear a handbag , i do n't wear a baby			2
' you see these women with 15 metres worth of @entity225 print fabric , it 's always @entity225 print , wrapped around their body and somewhere in there there 's a mewling baby			0
' victory ! peaches looked delighted as she posed up outside the @entity235 studios before heading home just about smiling : @entity5 's exit appearance was less cheery than @entity7 ' but @entity7 contended : ' it 's been going on for generations since mothers were in caves			1
for years and years , especially in less economically developed countries , mothers sleep with their babies and have a wildly less instance of mental health problems and health problems in general			0
the reason is because they are doing this thing that says to your baby , " i love you , i 'm there for you "			0
' [ caption when @entity5 attempted to step in once again , @entity7 responded : ' this is a prime example of someone who was n't attachment parented when she was growing up			1
' this is someone who goes on the media to slag off other women and slag off her own children			0
' given the last five seconds to conclude her argument , @entity5 said : ' it 's important to let your babies live their lives			1
' attachment parents are crap parents			2
' the row between @entity7 and @entity5 had started before they even arrived at @entity36			1
on @entity27 on tuesday morning , @entity5 had attempted to antagonise @entity7 by sharing a picture of @entity49 falling out of his pram , writing : ' @entity7 believes in attachment parenting			1
attached to a phone that is ... ' however , following @entity5 's tweet , @entity7 was quick to respond , blasting her for her accusation			1
she wrote : ' i do n't even want to reply to @entity5 desperate , incessant tweeting because it feeds her insatiable lust for recognition			2
however her posting low blows like a picture of my son falling from his pram when i tripped over a crack in a pavement has warranted at least a few responses from me			0
' this is the woman who wrote of a disabled sporting hero that she hoped that she would roll over nails on her way to a tv appearance			0
this is the woman who hates women , ethnic minorities , anyone with less money , anyone who dares point out the glaringly obvious about her own children on a regular basis			0
' peaches most catty barb came when she commented : ' i would n't be surprised if she had a shrivelled old pair of balls under that 1980s sloaney tweed skirt of hers			2
all the better to castrate her with			0
' date night : peaches and her husband attended the premiere of @entity315 : catching fire in @entity317 on monday night			0

the pair were on this morning to debate the idea of attachment parenting
their argument had started before they even appeared on the show with a *series* of catty barbs *exchanged* on @entity27
@entity5 looked *mightily* unimpressed after the debate , failing to raise a smile as she posed with @entity7
