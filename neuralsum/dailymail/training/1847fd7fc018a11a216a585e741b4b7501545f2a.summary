police have warned the public not to approach @entity1 , 40 , from @entity12 , who went missing from @entity2 , @entity3 , 12 days ago			1
his escape was revealed by @entity10 ( @entity10 ) today as a raft of bleak figures revealed a leap in the number of on - the - run inmates in the past year			1
@entity1 , who disappeared on july 19 , is the third prisoner to abscond from @entity2 this month			1
@entity19 , 33 , and @entity20 , 24 , left the @entity22 facility earlier in july			0

it is unknown what he was wearing when he left prison			2
' he is not to be approached by members of the public , ' said detective inspector @entity35 , from @entity10 's @entity36			0
' if anyone sees him or knows of his whereabouts , please contact @entity10 on 101 immediately			0
' sources who would prefer to pass on information anonymously are asked to contact @entity41			0
det @entity42 said : ' i would also urge @entity1 to hand himself in at his nearest police station and to remind people that if anyone is found to be assisting or harbouring @entity1 , they too will face being arrested and a possible prison sentence of their own			1
' elsewhere , it emerged that a prison officer had part of his ear bitten off by an inmate during an attack at @entity54			2
the latest prison walk - out emerged as @entity57 figures showed , in the words of shadow justice secretary @entity59 , ' violence is up , deaths in custody are up and the number of prisoners going on the run is up			1
' a total of nearly 230 inmates escaped or absconded from prisons in @entity70 and @entity71 last year , the figures showed , 10 per cent more than the previous year			2
these include 137 who walked out of open prisons , including @entity75 - known as the ' @entity76 ' - who sparked a nationwide manhunt after absconding from @entity79 on the @entity80 , @entity81			0
two male criminals fled jails and another two escaped prisoner escorts , the figures show			1
ninety absconders who have disappeared from prisons in the last decade were still at large at the end of last month , and another 79 have not returned after being granted temporary release since 2004			1
meanwhile the number of attacks on prison staff soared to its highest level for six years - up by more than a tenth to 3,363 in the 12 months to march - prompting suggestions that jails in @entity70 and @entity71 have become ' places of extreme violence '			1
and the number of prisoners who died in custody jumped by nearly a quarter in the year to march to reach its highest level for almost a decade			1
a total of 225 inmates died in jail in 2013/14 , compared with 181 in the same period the previous year			0
this was the highest number since 2005			0
critics said the figures were evidence that the country 's prisons were ' in crisis '			2
mr @entity59 told the @entity114 : ' the government is trying to hide the sheer scale of the failings in the @entity57 from the public by trying to pretend there 's not a problem , let alone a crisis			1
' this is all evidence of the incompetence of @entity124			0
' the evidence is piling up that the government has caused a prison crisis			2
the courses , training and healthcare needed to make sure prisoners are reformed are n't happening			0
' staring at their cell walls for hours on end , surrounded by death and violence , will do nothing to stop offenders committing further crimes on their release			0
' the national crowding rate in prisons was 22.9 per cent - meaning nearly one in four prisoners is being held in a cell , cubicle or room where the number of occupants exceeds the ' uncrowded ' capacity			2
@entity151 , of the @entity150 , told @entity152 : ' the prison population is increasing and despite changes introduced by the @entity57 we still believe that inappropriate prisoners are being sent to open conditions as the service tries to manage its available cellular accommodation			1
' ' incompetence ' : labour justice spokesman @entity59 , left , said today 's figures showed there was a ' prison crisis ' , but justice secretary @entity163 , right , defended the service 's performance in a ' period of change ' conservative justice secretary @entity163 said the service had experienced a ' significant period of change ' and admitted it had been ' a challenge '			1
although the number of absconds has risen year on year , the total of 225 was the third lowest since the current method of counting was introduced in 2004			0
mr @entity163 told @entity152 : ' over the last couple of years we have seen a major programme of reform across both prisons and probation - aimed at providing the best service to the public while lowering the cost to the taxpayer			0
' in this current economic climate all public services are required to help ease the burden			0
we are not exempt from that and have reduced our overall budget by 24 % , through sensible and well - considered reforms , commended by the @entity189			0
' as with any significant period of change - coupled with prison population increases higher than expected - it has been a challenge			2
we are responding to and managing the additional pressures but prisons are still running safe and decent regimes			0
' referring specifically to the figures on absconding prisoners , mr @entity163 said open prisons and temporary licence are ' important tools in rehabilitating long - term offenders ' , but stressed they ' will not be used at the expense of public safety '			1
he added that absconds have reached record lows under the coalition government , while the eligibility for open prisons has been tightened			0
@entity209 , director of the @entity210 , said : ' the tragic rise in the numbers of self - inflicted deaths in custody is the most vivid of the flashing warning signs of a prison service placed under unprecedented strain			1
