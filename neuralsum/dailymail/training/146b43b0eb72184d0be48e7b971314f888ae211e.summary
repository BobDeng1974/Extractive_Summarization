the bustling hub has been repeatedly ranked as the worst in @entity7 in customer satisfaction surveys			1

worst in @entity7 : a traveller takes pictures of a flight monitor showing cancelled flights at @entity3 in @entity4 @entity19 governor @entity9 has said @entity3 will benefit from a $ 3.6billion refit the project will create vast open spaces , restaurants , shopping plazas , new parking garages , free wi - fi and other amenities now common in other airports			1

@entity9 , who is running for re-election and has been mentioned as a possible @entity38 presidential candidate in 2016 , said he had become frustrated that talk of such renovations has been going on since the 1990s with little progress			1
he wants to jump - start construction just as he has done with a $ 3.9 billion project to replace the @entity44 , north of @entity4 , which also had been stalled for years			1
@entity3 , along the @entity46 and @entity47 bays in northern @entity48 , is the closest of the @entity51 's three major air hubs to midtown @entity52 , just eight miles , and it handled a record 27 million passengers last year			1

many passengers say it is like stepping back in time			1
they immediately encounter low ceilings and dimly lit , narrow hallways			1
check - in kiosks are arrayed haphazardly in rows just inside the entrances , where bright green neon lights blare ' welcome to @entity3			1
' on the west side of the terminal sits a modest food court featuring a hamburger counter , a pizzeria and a @entity80			1
' it 's probably the worst of all the terminals i go in and out of , ' said @entity84 , a frequent - flying energy company executive from @entity85 who has seen buckets on the floor under leaky ceilings and other signs of decay			1
' there 's no real food service other than small snack shops			1
the gate areas are old			2
' most passengers have to drag their carry - on bags down a flight of stairs to get from their gates to baggage claim because only one concourse has an escalator			2
others have complained that neither @entity104 nor @entity3 provides free @entity105 , something that has been industry standard for years			2
the four @entity4 metropolitan - area commercial airports have set an all - time record in 2013 for the number of passengers flying in and out			2

he noted that after the september 11 , 2001 , terror attacks , airports had to install security equipment for luggage and passenger screening			0
' the @entity152 equipment barely fits at @entity3 , ' @entity143 said			0
' @entity3 is just functionally disjointed			0
' in 2012 , @entity153 put @entity3 at the bottom of its ranking of the nation 's worst airports , saying it had the ' dubious honor of ranking the worst for the check - in and security process , the worst for baggage handling , the worst when it comes to providing @entity105 , the worst at staff communication , and the worst design and cleanliness			0
' the @entity57 and @entity110 , which operates the airport , concedes the facility is in need of an overhaul and had already begun awarding contracts for preliminary work at @entity3			0

the tricky part will come when construction is fully underway while the airport continues to serve millions			0
' everybody acknowledges that this is a complex undertaking but one that is absolutely necessary , ' said @entity188 , executive director of the @entity189 , which has advocated for improvements at @entity4 's airports			0
' it 's going to be a nightmare , ' added @entity194 , an airline industry analyst			0
' this is going to be the equivalent of @entity197 trying to change one of its models while the assembly line is still running			0
... but this is the way airports get redeveloped			0
' @entity206 , a @entity4 writer waiting for a flight at @entity3 , said the workers throughout the airport try to be friendly and helpful			0
