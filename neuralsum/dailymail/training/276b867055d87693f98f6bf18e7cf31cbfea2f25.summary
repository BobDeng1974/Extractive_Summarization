in the early 80s i landed a job on @entity22 's @entity21			0
@entity5 was already working on the show and i 'll never forget him walking through the door , all 6ft of him , announcing , ' i come bearing gifts ! ' even if it was only a bottle of warm @entity31 wine to welcome me			1
my then manager , who also looked after @entity5 , suggested i move into his flat in @entity34 and help with the rent			2
we became as close as brothers , and after we formed a double act i was catapulted to fame			0
sharing a flat with @entity5 - famous for his @entity42 impression - was a scream			2

i learnt a huge amount from @entity5 , who was about ten years older than me			2
his attention to detail when it came to doing impressions was extraordinary - i remember watching him putting a wig on a block and dressing it to look like @entity57 's hair - and i 've still got all his props in my loft at home			0
