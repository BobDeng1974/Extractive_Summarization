by @entity0 hundreds of pictures of the @entity5 president 's compound have been found on a rudimentary drone apparently operated by the @entity8 military , officials claim			1
security has been stepped up at the @entity10 in @entity11 , the official residence of current president @entity12 and location of a 1968 assassination attempt by @entity15 against the then @entity5 leader , since the discovery			1
the unmanned aerial vehicle was one of two which crashed on @entity5 soil in the past fortnight , sparking fears that the @entity25 dictatorship could adapt the technology for terror attacks			1
spying : this undated handout picture provided by the @entity29 shows an aerial image of @entity31 , @entity11 , from a camera on the unmanned @entity8 drone which crashed in @entity34 one crashed in @entity34 , a city near the border with @entity8 , on march 24			2
the other crashed monday on the island of @entity39			0
looking more like hobbyists ' remote controlled aeroplanes and equipped with cameras available on the internet for just a few hundred pounds , the captured drones were basic , at best , @entity5 experts said			1
but their discovery has prompted fears that @entity5 's air defences are not up to the job of securing the country 's airspace in the new era of drone warfare			1
' our government and military were not aware of the flight of the drone even when it was on a potentially dangerous mission , ' the mass - circulation @entity55 newspaper bellowed in an editorial			2
' the drones ' technology is not so impressive , but it could be used for terror if improved - either for a kamikaze attack or an attack with biological or chemical weapons			1
' this reconnaissance picture shows an aerial view of @entity11 's @entity72 : the discovery has prompted fears that @entity5 's air defences are not up to the job of in the new era of drone warfare an aerial image of @entity80 area of @entity81 : @entity5 defense officials say the drones are rudimentary , equipped with @entity85 - made cameras capable of taking only still photos that can not be transmitted defence officials revealed that the @entity34 drone had taken 193 photos of @entity5 's presidential compound and other areas in @entity11 and @entity34 , but they refused to disclose which other specific sites			1
the drone discovered monday had taken photos of two front - line islands - @entity96 and @entity97 - near the disputed western sea boundary with @entity8			2
@entity5 defense officials say they are rudimentary , equipped with @entity85 - made cameras capable of taking only still photos that can not be transmitted in real time but must instead be retrieved			1
the @entity34 drone was equipped with a @entity102 camera and the other one carried a @entity105 camera			0
@entity107 spokesman @entity106 said the @entity102 camera can be bought for about 1million won , or about Â£ 570 , on the @entity45			0
both were painted sky blue , probably cost only a few thousand dollars to build and were 55in wide by 71in long - giving them the appearance of the large model planes associated more with hobbyists than militaries			0
lettering on the battery of the drone found at @entity34 and other forensic evidence suggest it was of @entity8 origin , mr @entity25 said yesterday			0
he said it had enough fuel to return to @entity8			0
the first drone probably crashed due to an engine problem and the second ran out of fuel , he said , adding that they evaded detection because they are so small and made of polycarbonate			0
@entity127 : the drone discovered monday had taken photos of two front - line islands - @entity96 and @entity97 - near the disputed western sea boundary with @entity8 @entity132 : tthe captured drones are a far cry from the @entity138 - made @entity137 unmanned aerial vehicle , which @entity5 plans to introduce to its military in the near future , at about $ 208million a pop @entity8 has recently been boasting of its drone program , a relatively new addition to its arsenal			1
it has prominently displayed large drone - like aircraft in military parades			0
if the @entity5 claims that the @entity8 flew the drones on military surveillance missions are true , they would be the first solid , public evidence that it is trying to infiltrate @entity5 airspace			2
while the capture of the two surveillance drones appears to offer a rare glimpse into the @entity158 's technology , analysts stress they do not necessarily represent the best unmanned aerial vehicles the @entity158 can field			0
they also note the captured drones are a far cry from the @entity138 - made @entity137 unmanned aerial vehicle , which @entity5 plans to introduce to its military in the near future , at about $ 208million a pop. rudimentary : looking more like hobbyists ' remote controlled aeroplanes and equipped with cameras available on the internet for just a few hundred pounds , the captured drones were basic , at best defense minister @entity168 told @entity5 's parliament today that @entity8 has been developing unmanned drones since the @entity171			1
he said ministry officials are urgently working out measures to cope with drone threats as it 's possible for the @entity158 to acquire a technology to develop small unmanned aircraft with self - destructive capabilities in the future			2
but some experts say that fears of kamikaze drone strikes from the @entity8 are an overreaction - at least for the time being			1
' they can carry at most a hand grenade , ' said @entity186 , a retired air force general who heads the @entity187 at @entity188 in @entity5			0
' a small aircraft wo n't be easily detected by radar , but they ca n't carry much so they can only be used for surveillance purposes			0
a bigger size of aircraft is needed to carry weapons , but that would be detected by radar			0

two rudimentary drones have crashed in @entity5 in the past fortnight
officials say the ' basic ' drones are equipped with *consumer* - grade cameras
but their discovery has sparked fears of kamikaze drone terror attacks
