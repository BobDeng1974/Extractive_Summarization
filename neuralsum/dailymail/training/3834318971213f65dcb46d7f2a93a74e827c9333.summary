by @entity0 published : 11:01 est , 18 september 2013 updated : 05:34 est , 19 september 2013 @entity1 has banned children ’s beauty contests in an attempt to prevent the ‘ hyper - sexualisation ’ of youngsters			1
a new law enacted on tuesday night prevents anyone under the age of 16 from being judged on their physical appearance			1
it follows concerns expressed all over the world , including @entity15 where pageants are still legal , about girls being forced to grow up too fast			2
concern : @entity1 senator @entity19 ( right ) was concerned about a @entity21 magazine shoot in 2010 featuring provocative photographs of 10 - year - old @entity23 ( left ) now anyone caught organising a beauty competition for children in @entity1 faces up to two years in prison and fines equivalent of around 25,000 pounds			1
the new law is part of an equality bill introduced by women ’s minister , @entity33 , and now passed by the @entity34			2
@entity1 senator @entity19 , author of a report called ‘ against @entity36 ’ proposed an amendment to @entity33 ’s bill , calling for the end of children ’s contests			1
it was passed by 196 votes to 146 against			0
‘ let ’s not let our daughters think from such a young age that they will be judged according to their appearance , ’ said ms @entity19			1
‘ let ’s not let commercial interest impact on social interest			0
’ there is a long tradition of young girls in @entity1 taking part in beauty pageants , which are usually called ‘ @entity58 ’ competitions , with children and young teenagers sometimes wearing make - up and high heels			1
many believe they are harmless fun , however , and there was fierce opposition to ms @entity19 ’s amendment			0
she also wanted to bring in tough new regulations concerning child models , but these were rejected by the @entity34			0
ms @entity19 was particularly concerned about a @entity21 magazine shoot in 2010 featuring provocative photographs of a 10 - year - old @entity1 girl			2
the child , @entity23 , and two others wore make - up , tight dresses , high heels and designer jewellery			0
@entity21 defended the images , saying they merely portrayed the desire of young girls to dress like their mothers			1
while pageants have traditionally been a purely @entity86 phenomenon , with competitions across the @entity88 regularly filmed for downmarket reality shows such as @entity90 , they are becoming increasingly common in @entity15			0
the trend has attracted criticism from parenting groups and children 's charities about the sexualisation of children			0
the director of children 's charity @entity99 , @entity101 , warned recently : ' these children are so young , it 's impossible for them to be giving their consent to wearing swimwear and pseudo-evening dresses , as well as fake eyelashes and spray tans			0
