one is a luxury shirtmaker , while the other specialises in racy lingerie			0
but these two seemingly polar opposite brands ended up locked in a legal battle – over the name ‘ pink ’			0
high - end @entity7 , named after an 18th century tailor , took @entity11 underwear brand @entity12 to court after the latter brought out a range called @entity15 , which it described as being aimed at the ‘ college girl ’			1
luxury shirtmaker @entity7 has won a court case against @entity12 , barring the lingerie retailer from using the word ' pink ' on its shop fronts and clothing labels the @entity23 shirtmaker claimed this was confusing customers and that its brand , known for quality and tradition , could be ‘ tarnished ’ by association , while the underwear shop argued that the two target very different markets			1
but at the @entity34 yesterday , mr @entity33 ruled in favour of @entity7 , saying its luxurious reputation could be risked by @entity12 ’s ‘ sexy , mass market appeal ’			1
@entity39 , which began trading in @entity23 in 1984 , was named after an 18th century @entity23 tailor who designed the iconic hunting coat			0
it launched proceedings after @entity12 opened outlets in the @entity45 in 2012 branded as @entity12 and @entity15 , contending that it had entered the territorial zone of @entity7 's exclusivity and was using @entity15 as a primary sign on its garments and stores			1
it said it was obvious that the average consumer was likely to be confused , and that some had already tried to return lingerie to the defendant 's stores , or asked to buy @entity12 goods in @entity7 stores			1
@entity7 's lawsuit noted that this was likely to become the norm as @entity12 became more well known in the @entity45 in shopping areas close to @entity7 stores			1
the company also argued there was a real risk of its brand being tarnished as it was known for quality and tradition while @entity12 's message was sexy			2
@entity12 argued that it was a legitimate retailer and refuted the claim that there was something inappropriate or improper about its trading			2
it accepted that the two businesses were both related to clothing in general terms but said they were at opposite ends of the spectrum with @entity7 having older professional customers			2
in it 's claim , @entity81 argued that its exclusive brand would be ' tarnished ' if it became associated with the ' sexy , mass - market appeal ' of @entity12 it said that the @entity12 brand was a famous one and when customers encountered @entity15 , it was always firmly in the context of that famous name , which ruled out any conceivable possibility of confusion			1
but , at @entity23 's @entity34 today , mr @entity33 ruled that @entity12 's use of @entity15 both on its goods and as the name of its stores was an infringement of @entity7 's trade mark rights			2
he said that the use of @entity15 emblazoned on the defendant 's items of clothing gave rise to a likelihood of confusion as did its shop faces			0
the fact that some @entity15 stores were beside a @entity107 's secret store or linked inside did not make any difference , as the average consumer would not normally pay any attention to this			0
the judge said that @entity12 's use of @entity15 would cause a detriment to the repute of @entity7 's mark , although noted that the term ' tarnishment ' was perhaps too harsh			1
the judge said : ' the defendant 's overall business is a legitimate one			0
nevertheless , it is one which had been associated with some controversy , no doubt because " sexy sells "			0
' examples were in the evidence of goods which had to be withdrawn by the defendant after complaints			0
the defendant 's business aims to have a sexy , mass market appeal			1
' the link between the @entity133 ( community trade mark ) and the defendant 's @entity15 brand will cause consumers to associate the two			0
' the claimant 's trade mark will be associated with a mass market offering , reducing its luxurious reputation			1
' " there is every risk that this will lead consumers not to buy products from the claimant when they otherwise would have done			0
' later , @entity147 , president and chief executive officer at @entity7 said : ' we are delighted with the outcome of this case , and will continue to protect the considerable investment that has been made into building @entity7 into a leading luxury clothing brand			2

@entity7 has won case stopping @entity12 from using word ' pink '
tailor claimed having word on front of lingerie shops would tarnish image
judge *agreed* that reputation was put at risk by ' sexy , mass market appeal '
