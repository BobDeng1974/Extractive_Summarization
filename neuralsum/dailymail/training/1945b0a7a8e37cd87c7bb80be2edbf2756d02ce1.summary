more than a third of people in some of the country ’s best - loved seaside resorts are over- 65 , leaving them struggling to survive without an influx of young people , new figures revealed today			2
in one town , @entity9 in @entity10 , half of people are now retired , according to a new study by the @entity13			1
mps warned that without urgent investment in the 270 coastal communities in @entity18 and @entity19 some areas will struggle to retain the working age families needed to fuel the economies of towns dominated by old people ’s homes			1
the new census of coastal communities shows that on average 20 per cent of people living in them are aged 65 or over , compared to 16 per nationwide			1
however , a detailed breakdown reveals that in places like @entity31 in @entity32 , @entity33 in @entity34 , @entity35 in @entity36 and @entity37 in @entity38 the figure is more than 40 per cent and it is over 30 per cenrt in @entity40 in @entity34 and @entity41 in @entity38			0
the @entity13 said the data confirms the widely - held perception that ‘ older people are more likely to live by the coast ’			2
‘ in general , the smaller the coastal community the higher the share of population aged 65 or over , with the share rising from a 17 per cent average among the large coastal communities to a 25 per cent average among the small coastal communities			1
’ it also means there are fewer children : just 17 per cent in coastal towns are aged 0 - 15 , compared to 19 per cent for @entity18 and @entity19 overall			1
it means that 8 out of the 10 areas with the highest average age in the whole country are by the sea			1
in 2011 , some 6.2million people lived in a coastal communities , including 2.2 million who lived within the 12 largest			1
it means that 11 per cent of people live by the sea			1
while people choose to move to the seaside in their retirement , it can mean areas struggle to cope with increased demand on health and social care services			2
some 7 per cent of people in coastal areas have a long - term health problem that means day to day activities were ‘ limited a lot ’ , compared to 5.7 per cent of people nationwide			1
half of people in @entity9 in @entity10 are aged over 65 , the highest proportion of any seaside town in the country higher numbers of elderly people with health problems can put added pressure on care services @entity94 mp @entity93 , a member of the all - party group for coastal communities , said ‘ clearly there are increased social costs of being migratory places for retired people			1
at the moment when they move into an area they are at the top of their earnings capacity , but then they dip into savings			0
’ he warned that many areas councils have agreed large numbers of developments for gated retirement blocks and old people ’s homes			1
‘ we need to retain more of the working age , skilled people			2
a lot of it comes down to the housing policy			0
if you do n’t build in order to secure enough affordable housing for working age people on low wages the only people who will invest will be the likes of @entity127			1
‘ with the best will in the world pensioners are n’t the kind of people who are going to be going out and buying new furniture and renovating their properties			0
it is younger , working - age people who go out and spend money on those things			2
@entity94 mp @entity93 said more needed to be done to retain skilled , working age people in coastal towns he said a major problem was that people pay into council tax funds where they spend their working lives , but when they move to the seaside it is the coastal councils who have to pick up the social care bill			1
he warned that the money given to coastal towns was ‘ miniscule ’ compared to other regional growth funding			0
mr @entity93 insisted that there are also positives to having more retired people , who are ‘ really helpful at running community groups and charities ’ and acting as councillors or school governors			0
‘ they help to build stronger communities , ’ he added			0
the @entity13 data also shows how coastal communities differ from the rest of the country			0
more than 95 per cent of people living by the coast are white , compared to 86 per cent in @entity18 and @entity19			1
over half the coastal communities had in excess of 98 per cent of population with white ethnicity , the @entity13 said			0
people are more likely to live in rented homes at the seaside			2
some 19 per cent of families are in rented properties , compared to 15 per cent across the country			0
there are also more empty homes			0
the census in 2011 found 1.1 million houses which were not occupied by usual residents			0
these include holiday homes or apartments and properties with short - term residents			0
in @entity18 and @entity19 in 2011 , 4.4 per cent of household spaces were unoccupied by usual residents			2
the average was the same for large coastal communities , slightly higher ( 5.5 per cent ) for medium sized coastal communities but higher ( 10.5 per cent ) in small coastal communities			0
overall , across all coastal communities in this report the average was 6.1 per cent			0
in @entity9 in @entity10 and @entity194 in @entity36 , half of homes were not lived in full - time .			2

6.2million people live in a coastal community in @entity18 and @entity19
in some areas more than a third are over 65 , including half in @entity9
8 out of the 10 areas with the highest average age are by the sea
