a report from the @entity1 has claimed that the world must brace itself for more extreme weather , as it is locked on a path to unstoppable warming			1
they say some effects of climate change will be unavoidable owing to past and predicted emissions from power plants , factories and cars			1
but they say the worst impacts could be avoided by cutting global emissions			1
they say extreme weather will become more common as the climate changes			1
this is due to past and predicted emissions from factories and plants ( stock image shown ) , but the worst impacts can be avoided by cutting emissions the report , entitled ' turn down the @entity30 : confronting the @entity31 ' , stated that the average temperature on @entity18 will be 1.5 ° @entity33 ) above pre-industrial levels by 2050			1
sea levels will also continue to rise as the vast ice sheets in @entity37 and @entity38 thaw slowly			2
at current temperatures , it 's estimated seas would rise seven feet and six inches ( 2.3 metres ) in the next 2,000 years			0
temperatures are set to increase , though , meaning this effect will likely be faster - average temperatures have already risen by about 0.8 ° @entity46 ) since the @entity47 , according to the @entity1 's report			2
' today 's report confirms what scientists have been saying - past emissions have set an unavoidable course to warming over the next two decades , which will affect the world 's poorest and most vulnerable people the most , ' said @entity56 , president of the @entity1			1
' we 're already seeing record - breaking temperatures occurring more frequently , rainfall increasing in intensity in some places , and drought - prone regions like the @entity63 becoming drier			0
' the report reveals how rising global temperatures are increasingly threatening the health and livelihoods of the most vulnerable populations on @entity18 , magnifying problems each region is struggling with today			2
@entity71 and the @entity72 heat extremes and changing precipitation patterns will have adverse effects on agricultural productivity , hydrological regimes and biodiversity			0
in @entity81 , without additional adaptation , crop yields could decrease by up to 70 per cent for soybean and up to 50 per cent for wheat at 2 ° @entity84 ) warming by 2050			1
ocean acidification , sea level rise , tropical cyclones and temperature changes will impact coastal livelihoods , tourism , health , food and water security , particularly in the @entity72			0
melting glaciers would be a hazard for @entity98 cities			0
@entity99 and @entity100 a large increase in heat - waves combined with warmer average temperatures will put intense pressure on already scarce water resources , with major consequences for human consumption and regional food security			0
in @entity110 , @entity111 , and @entity112 , crop yields could decrease by up to 30 per cent at 1.5 to 2 ° c ( 2.7 to 3.6 ° f ) warming by 2050			1
migration and climate ‐ related pressure on resources may also increase the risk of conflict			0
@entity120 and @entity121 reduced water availability in some places becomes a threat as increases in temperatures head toward 4 ° @entity127 )			0
melting glaciers in @entity121 and shifts in the timing of water flows will lead to less water resources in summer months and high risks of torrential floods			0
in the @entity137 , a higher risk of drought will impact crop yields , urban health , and energy generation			2
in @entity142 , yield losses are projected of up to 50 per cent for maize , wheat , vegetables and grapes at 2 ° @entity84 ) warming by 2050			0
predicted effects include reduced crop yields and rising sea levels			1
in @entity81 , without additional adaptation , crop yields could decrease by up to 70 per cent for soybean ( pictured ( and up to 50 per cent for wheat at 2 ° c ( 3.6 ° f ) warming by 2050			1
in @entity110 , @entity111 , and @entity112 , crop yields could decrease by up to 30 per cent a common threat is the risks posed by heat extremes			2
state ‐ of ‐ the ‐ art climate modeling shows that ' highly unusual ' heat extremes , similar to the heat - waves experienced in the @entity163 in 2012 and @entity164 and @entity121 in 2010 , increase rapidly if emissions cause the world to warm by 4 ° @entity127 )			0
the report also reveals that the risks of reduced crop yields and production losses for the regions studied increase significantly above 1.5 to 2 ° c ( 2.7 to 3.6 ° f ) warming			1
for example , a rise of 2 ° @entity174 ) in average world temperature over pre-industrial times would mean a reduction in @entity81 crop yields of up to 70 per cent for soybean and up to 50 per cent for wheat in 2050			2
in the report mr @entity56 wrote : ' dramatic climate changes and weather extremes are already affecting millions of people around the world , damaging crops and coastlines and putting water security at risk			0
' as examples of extremes , he pointed to the hottest november day in @entity193 ' or the five to six feet [ 1.5 or 1.8 metres ] of snow that just fell on @entity195 ' in the @entity163			0
officials from almost 200 nations will meet in @entity198 from 1 to 12 december to work on a deal , due in @entity200 in late 2015 , to slow climate change .			1

@entity1 in @entity17 says @entity18 is locked on a path to warming
they say extreme weather will become more common as climate changes
this is due to past and predicted emissions from factories and plants
predicted effects include reduced crop yields and rising sea levels
but the worst impacts could by avoided by cutting global emissions
officials from about 200 nations will meet in @entity198 next month to work on a deal to slow climate change , due in @entity200 in late 2015
