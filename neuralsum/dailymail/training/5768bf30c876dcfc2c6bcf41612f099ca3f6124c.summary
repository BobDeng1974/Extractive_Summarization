by @entity0 published : 18:17 est , 9 march 2013 updated : 02:54 est , 11 march 2013 monitored : troubled star @entity1 wearing the tag on her ankle			1
the device has been fitted to 274,000 people in @entity6 since 2003 parents with a history of alcohol abuse are being fitted with @entity6 - style ‘ booze bracelets ’ to determine whether they can keep custody of their children			1
in the first @entity15 trial of its kind , the highly controversial ankle tags have been given to more than a dozen problem parents by the @entity19 and @entity20 ( @entity21 ) so a check can be kept on their promises to stay sober			1
the devices detect traces of alcohol released through the skin and are commonly used in the @entity28 to monitor alcohol - dependent criminals and tackle anti-social behaviour			1
troubled @entity31 actress @entity1 was ordered to wear one for a year after failing to turn up for a drink - driving court date			1
the @entity15 trial , which began last november , has involved 13 individual parents referred to the @entity21 in @entity35 after their drinking became so bad their children were taken into foster care			1
the court , set up in 2008 by district judge @entity39 , warns parents that they must change their behaviour or lose their children for good			1
it has so far presided over more than 200 cases			0
if parents commit to change , the court has a multi-disciplinary team run by @entity46 , a mental health unit , and @entity50 children ’s charity to provide immediate intensive support			1
the bracelets , known as @entity53 , are being used as an alternative to other forms of testing the @entity21 routinely carries out , for example blood and urine samples and hair strand analysis			0
they clip on to the ankle and every 30 minutes , 24 hours a day , test for the presence of alcohol fumes emitted by the skin			2
these readings are then transmitted to a base station usually installed at the individual ’s home			0
the base station uploads the data automatically to a central database in @entity72 , @entity73 , where it is processed and sent back to the @entity21			0
this allows the @entity21 to identify if any of the parents have consumed alcohol and , if so , how much and how often			2
it can also determine whether the bracelet has been tampered with			0
on average , @entity21 parents have worn them for 42 days , but the longest time was 98 days			0
the @entity21 says the system has proved highly successful and in a couple of cases parents have been allowed to return home with their children			1
regularly tested : @entity1 flaunts her @entity53 bracelet , which tests for alcohol every half an hour judge @entity39 said : ‘ we are dealing with troubled families who have child after child in the hope that one day the courts will let them keep one			2
' in one @entity35 borough alone , 203 children have come into the care system from just 49 mothers			2
‘ it seems crazy to go on in that way when there may well be another way of tackling their problems			0
it ’s expensive to keep removing children and adopting them – far better to tackle the heart of the issue , which is drug or alcohol problems			0
‘ the bracelet is no more expensive than having a hair strand test , which is historical and not current			0
if alcohol is detected it sends out an alert			0
punishment : @entity1 was ordered to wear one for a year after failing to turn up for a drink - driving court date ‘ if this happens , we are notified immediately			1
it provides local authorities with a greater degree of confidence in allowing parents to have contact with children who are in care , and in one or two cases it has allowed children to go home to their parents on the basis that the local authority will know very quickly if the parent chooses to drink			1
’ versions of the bracelet have been used in the @entity6 since 2003 and have been fitted to more than 274,000 people			2
dr @entity140 , laboratory director at @entity141 , the worldwide drug , alcohol and healthcare testing organisation which manufactures the devices , said : ‘ it ’s about helping an individual succeed			0
‘ they can see on record that they ’ve been successful			0
