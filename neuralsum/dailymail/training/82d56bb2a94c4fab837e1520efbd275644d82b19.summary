by @entity0 , mail online deputy political editor police have decided to prosecute @entity4 for driving away from a crash , it emerged today			1
the @entity6 revealed he will be charged over the incident in a blog on his website			0
mr @entity4 , who now faces the threat of losing his licence , bumped into another car when trying to turn his car round ' in a tight spot ' in his constituency			0
@entity4 attempted to perform a ' seven point turn ' in this street , but crashed into another car shadow chancellor @entity4 has a long record of motoring offences - including speeding , talking on a mobile and , now , failing to stop after a bump last month 's bump was the fourth time in recent years that mr @entity4 has landed himself in trouble behind the wheel			1
in 2013 , he received three points for driving through a red light on the @entity30 near @entity31 in @entity32			1
the same year he was caught speeding in his constituency in @entity34			1
he was clocked driving at 56mph in a 50mph zone			1
mr @entity4 paid a fine and attended a speed awareness course rather than accept penalty points			2
and in 2010 , the @entity40 heavyweight admitted ' stupidity ' after being caught talking on his mobile phone while driving			1
as a cabinet minister at the time , he was fined £ 60 and given three points on his licence - although these points have now expired			1
but instead of alerting the owner of the damaged black @entity49 , mr @entity4 drove off			1
he said that he had no idea he had caused any damage			0
pictures at the time showed mr balls ’ ageing @entity56 estate clearly showing scratch marks on the bumper , but his spokesman insisted they were the result of police taking a paint sample from the vehicle			2
at the time @entity64 confirmed officers were making inquiries into a ‘ fail to stop collision ’ on saturday , april 5			0
‘ damage was caused to the front offside wing of a parked black @entity49			1
enquiries are continuing , ’ a spokesman said			0
the @entity49 ’s 32 - year - old owner @entity72 – who has never voted – said he did not realise there was damage until the following day			1
mr @entity4 said he only found out that he had damaged the other motor when he was contacted by officers a week later			2
mr @entity4 today claimed the police had no choice but to charge him and insisted he accepted it fully			2
he revealed that he would be getting points on his licence as a result			2
a spokesman told @entity84 that he could receive between five and 10 points			1
on his blog today the @entity6 wrote : ' i ’d been turning our car round in a tight spot in the narrow private drive beside the @entity40 rooms in @entity93 where i park all the time			2
' another car was parked close by and i was aware the two bumpers touched			0
but i had no idea any damage had been done until the police got in touch a week later			1
' as soon as i was aware any damage had been done i immediately took full responsibility for any damage caused			0
i ’ve been in touch with the owner to apologise for the inconvenience and to pay for the repair to the marks on the parked car ’s bodywork			0
@entity4 is one of the most divisive politicians in @entity31			0
@entity112 regularly picks him out during prime minister 's questions ' the police have to do their job			2
once i ’d confirmed i knew the bumpers had touched , their standard approach is to proceed to charge as they expect people to stop and check			0
' i fully understand and accept that , so of course i will be accepting the charge			0
while i had no knowledge at the time that any damage had occurred , i accept their view that i should have checked			0
getting points on my licence will be a blow – but that ’s the way it works			2
' the scrape was caught on cctv camera and @entity137 's registration number was traced after the @entity49 's driver spotted some damage the following day			1
mr @entity4 revealed last month that he had been issued with a ' notice of intention to prosecute ' by the police over the ' fail - to - stop collision '			1
the offence could land mr @entity4 with a fine of up to £ 5,000			0

' damage was caused to the front offside wing of a parked black @entity49			1
' today a @entity64 spokesman insisted they were still consulting with prosecutors and no formal decision had been taken to proceed			0
mr @entity4 could potentially have to appear before magistrates even if he admitted the offence			0
while he could be banned from driving it is unlikely as he currently only has three penalty points on his licence			1
if he was stripped of his licence he faces a mammoth trip from his @entity34 constituency			0
he would have to take the train from @entity93 to @entity170 before changing for @entity32			0
once in the capital , around three hours later , he would have to take the tube to @entity31			0
during the week he could either catch a lift to work with his wife - the @entity40 mp @entity174 - or get the bus to monument from his home in @entity177 , north @entity32			1
he would then have to change onto the @entity178 to @entity31 .			0
