you have to give the player a chance to make a transfer when i see that his prospects to play are not so high			2
‘ you have to say it in advance because it ’s too late after august 31			0
i will tell payers after the tour but to them not to you			2
’ @entity11 was speaking at the @entity43 in @entity31 ahead of the @entity33 final against old rivals @entity34 on monday			1
@entity14 scored in the win against @entity59 on saturday that sent @entity5 through but it does not seem to have made much of an impression on his manager			1
having a good time : two @entity5 fans cheer on their team during the @entity158 @entity5 's hero : @entity50 struck twice to help his side beat @entity162 champions @entity59 ‘ i think the striker has the biggest chance to score so that it is not the reason why a player plays , ’ @entity11 added			1
‘ we are playing like team and the team scores			0
i do n’t make individual evaluations because we are playing with a team not individual players			2
’ responding to comments by @entity34 boss @entity174 that he will find the competitive nature of the @entity176 very different to working at @entity177 , @entity178 and @entity179 where the league is dominated by one or two clubs , @entity11 replied : ‘ that ’s why i ’m here			1
' ok , maybe he is right because i have to experience that but i was also in @entity185 and in my first year and i won three titles , in @entity187 i won two titles			0
if i win one here we will all be happy			0
up in the air : @entity190 ( left ) , @entity15 and @entity14 all face uncertain futures at @entity5 not ready : @entity192 ( left ) faces a race against time to be fit for the @entity176 opener the @entity5 boss will try to give many of his players 90 minutes against @entity34 as they step up their preparations			1
he has not ruled out the possibility of @entity200 featuring in the first game of the season at home to @entity204 even though the striker has made a late return to training with other @entity209 players @entity16 and @entity210			2
‘ they have already trained , ’ said @entity11			0
‘ i sent them to train with a special group			0
they could reach the first match , not against @entity216 ( in a friendly )			0
that depends on the individual because each one is different			0
‘ you have seen on this tour for example that @entity50 already played 90 minutes and @entity123 two matches of 90 minutes but not others			2
there is a difference between players and i have to see if they can do it or not			2
‘ i have to look at @entity200 if he is coming back or it			0
but if you have three weeks holiday and only four days training before @entity216 you are not fit enough			0
for the first game in the @entity176 it ’s possible but i do n’t think so			0
