by @entity1 reporter published : 12:53 est , 3 january 2014 updated : 06:02 est , 4 january 2014 an @entity4 icebreaker carrying passengers saved from a ship pinned tight by @entity8 sea ice halted its journey home today amid fears that a @entity12 ship involved in the rescue is now also icebound			1
the @entity14 had been cracking through thick ice toward open sea after a @entity12 helicopter yesterday plucked the passengers from a stranded @entity20 research ship and carried them aboard			1
but today , the crew of the @entity22 ( @entity23 ) , the @entity12 icebreaker that had provided the helicopter , said they were worried about their own ship 's ability to escape the ice			1
role reversal : the @entity12 ship @entity22 , or @entity23 , which had gone to rescue passengers stuck in an icebound research vessel , is now itself stuck in the heavy @entity8 sea ice complex operation : the @entity22 ( @entity23 ) @entity12 icebreaker , as seen from @entity4 's @entity8 supply ship the @entity14 , sits in an ice pack unable to make its way back to open water the end is in sight : the first of the 52 passengers on a research ship trapped in @entity8 ice for more than a week were finally rescued by helicopter after several aborted attempts to evacuate them the helicopter carried the passengers a dozen at a time over approximately five hours sea ice was preventing the barge from reaching the @entity12 icebreaker , the @entity23 , so the passengers are instead being taken to an nice floe next to an @entity4 vessel which will eventually take them to @entity59 the @entity60 was told to stay in the area in case the @entity23 needs help , according to the @entity65 's @entity64 , which oversaw the rescue			1
she had been about to embark on a journey to drop off the 52 scientists and tourists rescued from research vessel @entity71 at the @entity4 island state of @entity59			2
the @entity23 , which is at the edge of the ice pack surrounding the @entity71 , will attempt to push through the ice to open water early tomorrow , when tidal conditions are expected to be most favourable			0
the @entity60 is waiting around seven miles north of the @entity23 , said @entity79 , spokesman for the marine authority			0
authorities have not said what the next step would be if the @entity23 became stuck , but it is possible that the @entity60 could attempt to break through the ice to help the @entity12 vessel			0
the maritime authority said there was no immediate danger to anyone aboard the @entity23 and that the decision to keep the @entity60 on standby was just a precaution			2
but it was yet another problem to hit the highly complex rescue operation of those on board the @entity98 , which got stuck in the ice on @entity100			0
a helicopter from a nearby @entity12 icebreaker flies over the first group of passengers as it comes in to land mission is a go ! rescuers leave a helicopter from a @entity12 icebreaker after landing next to the ship ' a huge thanks to all ' : expedition leader @entity112 points to a makeshift helipad which the crew created in the ice as he awaits the helicopter 's arrival a spot of clear weather yesterday finally allowed the multinational rescue operation after blinding snow , strong winds and thick sea ice forced rescuers to turn back time and again			1
the twin - rotor helicopter , based on the @entity23 , took seven hours to carry the scientists and tourists in groups of 12 from the @entity20 ship to the @entity60			2
earlier , the passengers had linked arms and stamped out a landing site in the snow next to the @entity20 ship for the helicopter			2
helicopter pilot @entity136 told @entity12 's official @entity137 that he had no way of knowing whether the ice could withstand the helicopter 's weight			2
the rescue came in the never - ending daylight of summer after days of failed attempts to reach the vessel			0
' i think everyone is relieved and excited to be going on to the @entity4 icebreaker and then home , ' expedition leader @entity112 said by satellite phone from the @entity8			1
@entity152 resident @entity151 , a paying passenger , wept as she boarded the @entity4 icebreaker			1
she said the passengers had spent their time watching films and playing games			0
' it really has been an emotional rollercoaster , ' she told a reporter from the @entity160 newspaper who is aboard the ship			0
stuck : passengers from the @entity20 ship @entity165 link arms and stamp out a helicopter landing site on the ice near the trapped ship 1,500 nautical miles south of @entity170 , @entity4 ship : the rescue operation for the 74 passengers , comprising scientists , tourists and crew on the @entity20 ship @entity165 , has been plagued by one delay after another since the vessel became stuck still smiling : stranded passengers shelter in a tent lashed to the ship 's top deck as they sing a song they wrote , streaming live online to welcome in the new year the 22 crew members of the @entity98 stayed with the icebound vessel , which is not in any danger and has enough supplies on board to last for weeks			1
they will wait until the ice surrounding the ship breaks up , which could take several weeks , @entity193 manager @entity192 said			0
the cost of the rescue would be carried by the owners of the ships and their insurers , in accordance with international conventions on sea rescues , mr @entity192 said			0

the @entity98 , which left @entity220 on november 28 , got stuck after a blizzard pushed the sea ice around the ship , freezing it in place about 1,700 miles south of @entity170 , @entity59			0
