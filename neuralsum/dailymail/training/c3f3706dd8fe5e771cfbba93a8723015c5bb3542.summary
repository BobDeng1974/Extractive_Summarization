@entity0 had far less gum disease during @entity3 occupation than people today			1
evidence of the disease on ancient skulls is pictured @entity0 had far less gum disease during @entity3 occupation , 1,800 years ago , than people today - even though there was little dental care , experts claim			1
just five per cent of 300 skulls examined , which date between 200ad to 400ad , showed signs of severe periodontitis , or gum disease , which affects three in 10 people today			1
experts believe that modern habits such as smoking are responsible for the decline in the nation ’s gum health			1
professor @entity25 , of @entity26 , said : ‘ we were very struck by the finding severe gum disease appeared to be much less common in the @entity3 - @entity29 population than in modern humans - despite the fact that they did not use toothbrushes or visit dentists as we do today			2
‘ gum disease has been found in our ancestors including in mummified remains in @entity38 - and was alluded to in writings by the @entity40 , @entity41 and @entity42 as well as the early @entity43			0
’ gum disease is the result of a chronic inflammatory response to the build - up of dental plaque			1
much of the population lives with a mild form but factors such as smoking or medical conditions like diabetes can trigger more severe chronic gum disease , which can lead to the loss of teeth			2
experts believe that modern habits such as smoking ( stock image ) are responsible for the decline in the nation ’s gum health			1
@entity64 , of the @entity65 , said : ‘ this study shows a major deterioration in oral health between @entity69 and modern @entity70 professor @entity25 said : ‘ one of the main reasons for doing the study was the realisation in recent years that a lot of periodontal disease was associated with smoking and to a lesser extent diabetes , and although oral hygiene is obviously important it was n’t the only factor that contributed to destructive periodontal disease			2
‘ this study was a way of looking at the reverse of modern causative factors - poor oral hygiene but less other contributory factors such as smoking and diabetes			0
’ the research , published in the @entity93 , examined 303 skulls from a @entity96 - @entity29 burial ground in @entity97 in @entity98 for evidence of dental disease			2
while instances of gum disease in the @entity106 - @entity29 skulls was low , many of them showed signs of infections and abscesses - and half had tooth decay			1

the ancient population also showed extensive tooth wear from a young age , caused by a diet rich in coarse grains and cereals			0
‘ some tooth decay was seen in many of the population - the main difference of this to modern populations was that this was typically confide to one or 2 teeth , whereas it is more widespread in the mouth today , ’ professor @entity25 said			0
‘ quite a lot of infection also arose because of the severe tooth wear resulted on occasions in exposure of the dental pulp - the dental nerve inside the tooth - and this would be a very predictable way of getting chronic infections ’ the @entity97 cemetery community was made up of countryside dwellers as well as a @entity176 urban population			0
this was a non-smoking population and likely to have had very low levels of diabetes			0
gum disease is the result of a chronic inflammatory response to the build - up of dental plaque			1
this magnified photo shows an accumulation of bacterial plaque and the early formation of calcified tartar among the people who survived infancy , childhood illnesses and malnutrition into adulthood , the average age seems to be 40 , with infectious diseases believed to have been the reason for death			0
@entity64 , of the @entity65 , said : ‘ this study shows a major deterioration in oral health between @entity69 and modern @entity70			0
‘ by underlining the probable role of smoking - especially in determining the susceptibility to progressive periodontitis - in modern populations there is a real sign that the disease can be avoided			0
‘ as smoking declines in the population we should see a decline in the prevalence of the disease			0

gum disease is a chronic inflammatory response to the build - up of plaque
just five per cent of 300 skulls examined which date between 200ad to 400ad , showed signs of severe periodontitis ( gum disease )
this *compares* to between *15* per cent and 30 per cent of people today
@entity232 skulls were *unearthed* in @entity97 in @entity98
experts say modern habits like smoking cause the decline in oral health
