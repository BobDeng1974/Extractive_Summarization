by @entity0 published : 21:52 est , 3 october 2012 updated : 02:00 est , 4 october 2012 a father who was run over by his own car after it took off with him beneath it to the witness of his three young boys is hospitalized in critical condition this week			1
@entity8 had climbed beneath his jeep trying to jump start it on a @entity11 , @entity13 road when it took off on sunday afternoon while carrying his children , the oldest aged 11			1
' he had to get up underneath it and start it with a screwdriver by touching the solenoid 's together and just that split second he did n't put it back in park from drive , ' @entity19 , his friend of 25 years told @entity24			1
taking off , the vehicle rolled directly over the father and into a roadside ditch			2
the wheels stopped spinning only after his oldest son , aged 11 , hopped into the front seat and shifted it into park			1
' unfortunately , the vehicle ran over his chest and head area			1
he has some brain trauma , ' said mr @entity19			0
tragic mistake : a family friend said that mr @entity8 forgot to put his vehicle in park after it stalled on this road and before he climbed beneath it to get it going again the coincidence of an off - duty @entity61 worker driving behind mr @entity8 along with his airlift to a nearby hospital are what mr @entity19 credits for saving his friend 's life			1
but visiting him in hospital after his surgery on monday and seeing the extent of his injuries he said left him not only ' mortified , ' but ' terrified for him and for his kids			0
' ' he was hooked up to a lot of machinery , he was obviously hurting , ' said mr @entity19			0
' i 'd like to think that he knew i was there			0
they had him doped up pretty good on medication so he was n't talking			0
' son 's quick thinking : pictured with two of his three young boys , it was his oldest son , aged 11 , who jumped in the passenger seat and put the car in park as its wheels spun in a ditch it was a state trooper and mr @entity8 's young children that told him everything that had happened			1
' it 's just terrible what 's happened to him and his family over this			0
they really need the help and prayers of all the people around here to help @entity8 get through this , ' he said			2
further helping the father and his family in their time of need , mr @entity19 has set up a trust fund for mr @entity8 â€™s wife at their local @entity110 bank			2
the boys ' school is also holding a fundraiser			0
