analysis of an ancient pelt buried with the remains of a @entity5 princess has revealed that bears once roamed the hills of @entity8 , experts have claimed the animal skin was discovered inside a bog in 2011 on @entity11			1
it was found wrapped around objects in the grave , including a woven basket and cremated human remains			0
all the finds discovered at the 4,000 - year - old site , including the fur and exotic beads , indicate the grave was for a person of high status			1
archaeologists believe that wild brown bears once lived on @entity8 , after discovering a 4,000 - year old fur pelt ( pictured ) buried with the remains of a @entity5 princess ‘ it ’s entirely possible bears were living in the local area , ' said @entity31 , curator of @entity32 , where the grave finds are on show			1
‘ we think bears were spread around @entity36 at the time			0
their natural habitat was around woodland so they may have been around @entity8			1
’ typical dna analysis methods failed because of the effect of the bog on the pelt , so it was sent to the @entity45 in the @entity46 where a process called peptide mass fingerprinting was used			1
@entity49 , @entity51 ’s science advisor for the @entity52 said : ‘ finding the right technique to analyse it took some time			0
the pelt was found in 2011 in a peat bog on @entity11 wrapped around artefacts found in the grave , including a woven basket containing precious amber beads and earrings , as well as the cremated remains of a @entity5 princes ( actor pictured ) @entity31 , curator of @entity32 , where the grave finds are on show , said : ' it 's entirely possible bears were living in the local area			1
we think bears were spread around @entity36 at the time			0
their natural habitat was around woodland so they may have been around @entity8 ' despite there being about 200 burial cists on @entity8 , the moor has offered up few secrets before due to grave robbing			1
‘ this is the most outstanding site to have been excavated locally in over 100 years , ’ said ms @entity75			0
‘ the items that were discovered in the cist are of national and international importance and provide one of the best glimpses into life in @entity5 southern @entity84 that academics and scientists have ever had			2
’ they are now on show at @entity32			0
the results indicated that the pelt once belonged to a brown bear			1
‘ we thought it would be one of the easiest finds to identify - it looked very well preserved - but these things are so rarely preserved at all that we have little experience of working on them			1
’ other discoveries at the 4,000 - year - old site include a hoard of about 150 beads			2
' some of the beads were made from amber which would have been traded from abroad , suggesting a person of high social status , ' said ms @entity31			2
in february , experts said that the buried artefacts could have belonged to a @entity5 princess			1
the basket held a collection of precious beads , wooden earrings and a flint flake , shedding light on an advanced society capable of amazing craftsmanship and international trade			1
the objects were the subject of a @entity122 2 documentary in march called ' @entity123 , ' in which viewers saw the coiled bag opened for the the first time in 4,000 years			1
the basket ( pictured ) is around 4,000 years old and held a collection of ancient beads , wooden earrings and a flink flake , shedding light on a @entity5 society capable of amazing craftsmanship and international trade the objects were pulled from a prehistoric cremation burial chamber ( pictured ) in @entity135 and have allowed scientists to get one of the best glimpses into life in bronze age @entity84 @entity141 finds including prehistoric wooden earrings ( pictured right ) , beads ( also pictured ) , a studded bracelet and a near perfectly animal pelt have just gone on show at a new exhibition the basket bag is fashioned from two circular disks measuring 4.5 inches ( 12cm ) in diameter to form a flat base and lid , which is joined by a tube made using a coiled basketry technique with cow hair stitching around the edge and was preserved in peat			1
the wooden earrings inside , which measure up to an inch ( 2.5cm ) in diameter , have side grooves and are made from spindle wood – a hard , fine grained tree that grows in @entity8 which is traditionally used to make knitting needles			1
the wooden earrings ( pictured ) measure up to two - and - a - half centimetres in diameter and and are made from spindle wood - a hard , fine grained tree that grows in @entity8 which is traditionally used to make knitting needles ‘ the studs are unique in @entity36 prehistory ; they also represent the earliest evidence for wood turning in the @entity36 , ’ experts at the @entity172 said			1
archaeologists are used the objects to build up a picture of the person who was buried at the site on @entity11 and it is thought they were of considerable importance in the local community			0
they speculate that the items , which also include precious jewellery , belonged to a women between the ages of 14 and 25 - years - old , who was probably a princess			1
an expert at @entity172 told @entity192 that archaeologists came to this conclusion as other lesser , comparable items have been founded in prehistoric cairns			0
the princess was of incredibly high social standing , as evidenced by the high position of her final resting place 600 metres above sea level on the northern moors , which would have been visible to nearby settlements and the valuable items that were buried with her			0
a delicate woven bracelet with tin studs ( pictured ) was also unearthed			1
a total of 35 tin studs were held in place by a band of woven cow hair ( although 32 remain )			0
while the metal has oxidized , it would have been shiny in appearance the ancient burial chamber ( pictured ) was deliberately positioned high upon a hill to show the princess ' high status , experts said			2
they expect to find a settlement nearby @entity222 were skilled at making tin and might have traded it with other far flung communities			0
they used to create elaborate jewellery , such as the delicate bracelet that was found			2
other materials found at the site - including amber beads - show that people traded internationally			0
a stone flint also discovered , showed that while people used bronze tools , there were also still using earlier tools , which again , would probably have been traded			0
high status individuals were revered and were buried in elaborate burial chambers with precious possessions			0
it is not known how many people the princess would have ruled over but @entity8 was well inhabited 4,000 years ago			1
the remains of 5,000 hut circles - @entity5 houses have been discovered so far that had conical thatched roofs			2
archaeologists have previously found small clusters of these houses in fenced enclosures that would have protected people from animals			0
people at the time had advanced cultural and religious beliefs			0
high status people also took care with their appearance and wore carefully crafted clothes and jewellery from fur pelts to tin beaded bracelets			1
archaeologists first stumbled across the chamber a decade ago when a stone fell out of the peat hag which had been concealing it – far from other known prehistoric sites			2
' the find fills in the blanks of the local map in terms of @entity5 settlements , as before there was little evidence of inhabitation , so there must be a settlement nearby , ' one local expert told @entity192			2
' there 's much more to discover in the area , ' he said			2
a skilfully - made decorative sash or belt was folded around the cremated remains along with the pelt			2
it is composed of textile and leather with a fringe of outward pointing leather triangles made from thin calf skin			0
but the discovery of beads made of tin initially got archaeologists particularly excited because they are the earliest evidence of tin production found in the @entity52			2
over 200 beads were plucked from and around the basket and some are made from amber			2
the precious material from the @entity302 was associated with supernatural powers and used as an amulet , which therefore suggests a very high status burial as well as demonstrating that @entity306 traded with people from the continent			0
a delicate woven bracelet with tin studs was also unearthed			1
a total of 35 tin studs are held in place by a band of woven cow hair			0
while the metal has oxidized , it would have been shiny in appearance			0
‘ the use of tin for decorative objects is exceptionally rare within prehistoric burial contexts in @entity36 and despite tin being a locally available resource on @entity8 , this is the first time it has been found within a prehistoric archaeological context , ’ local experts said			1
ms @entity31 said : ‘ this is the most outstanding site to have been excavated locally in over 100 years			0
' ‘ the items that were discovered in the cist are of national and international importance and provide one of the best glimpses into life in @entity5 southern @entity84 that academics and scientists have ever had			0
’ the artefacts have just gone on display at @entity32			0
over 200 beads were plucked from and around the basket and some are made from amber , demonstrating international trade as the precious material comes from the @entity302			1
the grey beads are made from shale and the centre bead from tin - another precious material showing the wearer was of high social status here , a model wears modern replicas of what the prehistoric jewellery is thought to have looked like			1
the use of tin for decorative objects is exceptionally rare within prehistoric burial contexts in @entity36 and has not been discovered before			0

@entity361 pelt was among a hoard of @entity5 *treasure* unearthed in @entity8
it 's thought to have belonged to a princess aged under 25 years old
peptide mass fingerprinting was used to identify the fur belonged to a bear
experts say that brown bears lived in the area 4,000 years ago
precious jewellery made of amber and tin , plus delicate fur and fabric was preserved in peat and demonstrates craftsmanship and trade links
