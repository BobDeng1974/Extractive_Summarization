@entity0 was forced to apologise last night after ambushing @entity1 on live television with a list of alleged @entity5 paedophiles compiled from a cursory search on the internet			1
@entity0 admitted he had put it together after spending three minutes collecting unsubstantiated gossip online – and that a ' misjudged camera angle ' meant some of the names could have been seen by viewers			1
presented with the list , the prime minister responded by warning of a ' witch - hunt ' that meant prominent people were being wrongly accused of child abuse simply because they were gay			1
there are growing cross-party calls for a single , overarching investigation now that the number of separate probes into allegations of paedophilia at the @entity50 , care homes and in @entity52 has reached double figures			0
during what was supposed to be an interview on this morning about dementia , @entity0 declared there could have been ' a cover - up , a paedophile ring amongst the elite of @entity61 that led all the way to @entity32 ' and handed a card with names on it to the prime minister			1
' you know the names on that piece of paper			0
will you be speaking to those people ? ' @entity0 asked			2
the presenter admitted : ' it took me about three minutes last night to continually find a list of the same names			0
' the prime minister takes the card and responds with firm words warning of a ' witch hunt ' that meant prominent people were being wrongly accused of child abuse simply because they were gay the prime minister was visibly taken aback by the stunt and some viewers said names were clearly visible on the piece of paper handed to the prime minister the prime minister did not look at the card on air , instead placing it on the table in front of him , but @entity99 sources confirmed later it had included half a dozen names of senior conservatives who had been members of or associated with the governments of the 1980s			1
a composed mr @entity1 said he did not like what @entity0 was doing , saying : ' look @entity0 , i think this is really important			2
there is a danger if we are not careful , that this can turn into a sort of witch - hunt , particularly against people who are gay			1
' i 'm worried about the sort of thing you are doing right now ... giving me a list of names you have taken off the internet			0
@entity5 mp @entity119 wrote to @entity120 last night asking the media watchdog to investigate whether this morning broke tv fairness rules ' anyone who has any information about anyone who is a paedophile , no matter how high up in @entity128 society they are , that is what the police are for			1
' it is understood that the passing of the list to @entity1 was the production team 's idea , although it is believed @entity0 may have had some input into it			2
it is unclear if the programme took any legal advice before doing it			0
@entity0 later apologised , saying : ' if any viewer was able to identify anyone listed , i would like to apologise and stress that was never my intention			0
mr @entity1 had agreed to appear on this morning to talk about dementia , including an event held at @entity32 where he discuss the issue with tv presenter @entity149 ' i was not accusing anyone of anything and it is essential that it is understood that i would never be part of any kind of witch - hunt			1
' unfortunately there may have been a misjudged camera angle for a split second as i showed the prime minister some information i had obtained from the internet			1
' i asked for his reaction to give him the opportunity to make a point which he very clearly made about the dangers of any witch - hunt			1
' @entity0 's on - air ambush prompted immediate condemnation			0
@entity50 veteran @entity173 wrote on @entity36 : ' how cretinous can you get – giving a list of online names to @entity160 as though they were evidence			0
makes a mockery of our trade			0
' @entity5 mp @entity119 last night reported @entity182 to broadcasting regulator @entity120 , claiming the programme had broken rules on fairness			1
he said : ' some of us have been painstakingly trying to get to the bottom of these allegations about @entity189 and others for months in a responsible and diligent way			0
' it is very unhelpful for celebrities to ambush the prime minister and reveal information that is not in the public domain for very good reason			2
after the tv showdown , mr @entity1 returned to @entity32 where he took a call from @entity201 president @entity200			2
he congratulated him on his his re-election @entity204 met with welsh secretary @entity205 this week to discuss his claim he was abused by a senior @entity5 while at the @entity204 home in @entity209 @entity210 , who as @entity205 set up the @entity204 into abuse at care homes in @entity209 , said ' no stone would be left unturned ' by a series of new government reviews ' if @entity0 feels his information is watertight , he should take it to the police without delay			0
' former conservative whip @entity220 said @entity0 had been ' very foolish and irresponsible '			0
he added : ' i loathe witch - hunts			0
in this country , you are innocent until proven guilty			0
' @entity5 mp @entity225 , who was a councillor in @entity226 at the time of the original inquiry into the @entity209 abuse scandal , described @entity0 's tactic as ' completely irresponsible			2
' an @entity232 spokesman : ' it is extremely regrettable that names may have been very briefly visible as a result of a misjudged camera angle , although most viewers would not have been able to read the list			1
' an aide to the prime minister said : ' this silly stunt has resulted in people 's names being put out there			2
' they will want to vigorously defend themselves			0
' the prime minister 's official spokesman said : ' we should n't have people just throwing names and accusations around and trial by @entity36			1
' video : the astonishing moment this morning presenter @entity0 handed the prime minister a list of alleged @entity5 child abusers he found online			1

*no.* 10 condemned the ' trial by @entity36 ' saying those named on the list will want to defend themselves
mr @entity1 accused the @entity232 programme of *fuelling* a ' witch - hunt , particularly against people who are gay '
