@entity1 boss @entity0 deserves respect , not ridicule , for complaining about the size of the pitch at @entity5			1
it ’s the managers who look at the fine details that create success			2
now he ’s pointed out the problem , it ’s time to find a solution			1
it ’s easy to become flustered by the speed of the game in a tight space and even controlling the ball can become difficult			2
that is all amplified when results are n’t going your way			0
measuring in at a pocket - sized 100m x 67m @entity5 is the third smallest pitch in the @entity24 the @entity1 manager believes the small size of the @entity5 pitch is counting against his team @entity29 heads @entity30 into the lead as @entity1 fell apart at @entity5 last sunday we know @entity0 wants his new team to play expansive , attacking football but that does n’t happen simply because there is more grass to work on			1
it ’s all linked to confidence and making the space work for you			1
@entity42 made the pitch at @entity44 smaller because he wanted to stifle top teams			0
at @entity46 we had an incredibly tight pitch and with compact stands and the crowd so close it made life very uncomfortable for the opposition but we relished it			2
when we played our @entity54 games at @entity55 , we struggled because of the size of the pitch and vastness of the stadium			0
@entity0 has said he feels like a psychologist at @entity1 , but must give his players the confidence to play @entity63 has shown some glimpses of what he can offer but there is still work to be done at @entity1 another player whom @entity68 believes is key for @entity1 this season is @entity71 star @entity70 the @entity24 pitches in order of size the @entity46 pitch was about as big as the surface at @entity5 but some of the football under @entity78 was the most fluid you will ever see			1
the trick was to make it feel cramped for the opposition but huge for us			1
it encouraged our style of play and helped us smother our opponents			0
our attitude was : ‘ we can cope in this space			0
can you ? ’ on a small pitch you must be comfortable in possession and move the ball quickly			2
you want your match - winners in possession in the final third and we did that by playing two - touch football to get @entity98 and @entity99 on the ball			0
@entity0 will know all this and he has men who can operate at speed in tight spaces			2
@entity70 , @entity63 and @entity105 have been among @entity1 ’ better players this season and the manager might do well to adopt a similar style of moving the ball quickly to those three			1
the @entity112 coach has said he feels like a psychologist at @entity1 but it ’s his job to instil confidence in the players			1
they need that air of authority to create time and space on the ball			1
before the 2011 @entity54 final , i watched @entity126 training at @entity127			0
they had the freedom of the training ground but set up in a tight corner			0
they even had the buildings overshadow them to recreate the overhang of a stadium			0
@entity137 drilled his side to be comfortable in confined spaces so then when they were in a match they felt they had the freedom of the park			0
when i played for @entity146 and @entity147 at @entity46 , i saw it from the other side			0
it was so tight and there was no time on the ball			2
it was like switching from driving on a motorway , where you ’re almost unaware of how fast you ’re moving , to doing the same speed in the suburbs			0
as a home player that gave you a real buzz ; as a visitor it was a nightmare			0
spurs could make life much more difficult for their opponents			0
@entity0 ’s @entity167 were the best at pressing high and early but we ’ve yet to see that at @entity1			1
in football if you work early , you work less and those rewards are doubled on a tighter pitch			2
@entity0 proved himself at @entity167 , where they combined aggressive pressing and fluent attacking , so it ’s ridiculous to hear any @entity1 fans calling for his head			1
@entity1 might have lost three home games , but it ’s time to turn the tightness of @entity5 into a home advantage			1
@entity68 says @entity1 must use the confines of their pitch to their advantage , much like @entity127 did at @entity46			1

@entity0 must find solution to his problem , says @entity68
@entity68 claims the trick is in making it feel cramped for the opposition
the @entity1 boss must instil confidence in his players to create time and space on the ball if they are to make the pitch work to their advantage
