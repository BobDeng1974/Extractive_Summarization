' all it takes is basic human decency ' : but @entity2 said complaints about poor treatment by officialdom are still not being properly handled police , prosecutors and the courts are still failing to show enough compassion to victims of crime , a scathing report warned last night			1
@entity16 ’ commissioner @entity2 – whose husband @entity13 was killed by a gang of yobs – said complaints about poor treatment by officialdom are not being properly handled			1
those who spoke out , including people who had been violently attacked or lost a loved one , said they were left feeling ‘ dismissed ’ , ‘ confused ’ or ‘ unimportant ’			2
ministers have repeatedly promised to make the justice system more considerate of victims and @entity25 peer @entity2 , 53 , was appointed to check its progress			2
however , in her first report , she found almost 75 per cent of victims who complained about the handling of their case were unhappy with the response			1
@entity2 said : ‘ it is shocking how many victims told me how ignored , dismissed and confused they felt when they tried to raise concerns about their treatment			1
‘ all it takes is basic human decency to explain to a victim , in a sensitive and timely way , why something has gone wrong and what they can do about it			0
‘ i have seen excellent examples of work by agencies across the country but it ’s clear that many victims are still not getting the service they deserve			2
the review found that there was ‘ inadequate attention to the personal touch victims need ’ one victim told @entity2 : ‘ i ’m just frightened ... i think they will harass me if i complain about the way they have treated me and my daughter			1
’ another said : ‘ i raised concerns about the process , the process was almost worse than the actual journey of being a victim			2
’ @entity2 ’s husband was murdered by yobs outside his home when he confronted a gang who were vandalising his car in @entity74 , @entity75 in 2007			2
he was kicked ‘ like a football ’ , dying in hospital three days later			0

she said it was ‘ crucial ’ for the authorities to start listening			0
she added : ‘ we victims are not just complainers			0
if anything , we are thrown into a new world of rules and regulations and then into a dark labyrinth of the unknown			0
‘ if we feel that we are not satisfied with a service , then we should be able to get clear guidelines on how to complain , regular updates and a full explanation of the outcome			0
” justice ? those who spoke out in @entity2 's report , including people who had been violently attacked or lost a loved one , said they were left feeling ‘ dismissed ’ , ‘ confused ’ or ‘ unimportant ’ @entity108 justice secretary @entity107 said : ‘ this is a damning indictment of the way victims and witnesses have been let down by @entity113			1
‘ we can not go on treating victims as an afterthought or worse still ignoring them altogether			0
victims losing confidence in our justice system leads to crimes going unreported and witnesses not providing evidence			0
‘ if victims give up on reporting matters and helping in prosecutions it could lead to the wheels of our justice system grinding to a halt leaving criminals roaming the streets			0
’ the @entity129 said more money than ever before was being made available to support victims , with a potential budget of £ 100million			1
officials also highlighted steps to allow vulnerable witnesses to give evidence from outside the courtroom and plans to establish a new victims ’ information service by march 2015			1
victims ’ minister @entity140 said : ‘ i want to put the highest emphasis on the needs of victims , and an important part of that is making sure the criminal justice system always listens to what they have to say and treats them with the utmost respect and sensitivity			1
‘ to help achieve this i have already committed to enshrining their rights in law			0
we have also significantly strengthened their entitlements in the @entity138 ’ @entity160 , and are reviewing whether new powers are needed so that they can better hold the system to account			0
