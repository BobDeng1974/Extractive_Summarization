the @entity3 have to cover the costs of these phantom patients because doctors are given £ 66.25 for each person registered to their practice			1
@entity35 , chief executive of the @entity36 said : ' this is a scandalous waste of taxpayers ’ money and further proof , if more was needed , that the heath budget is not being spent wisely			1
' given the amount of cash that has been thrown at @entity3 record system in recent years it ’s absurd that so many ghost patients exist			0
' those who have cynically exploited this leak , along with officials who have allowed this problem to go unchecked , must be held to account for their actions			0
' resigned : in 2011 doctors @entity51 and @entity52 denied that more than 1,000 patients registered at their clinic were either dead or had moved overseas the chief executive of the @entity56 , @entity55 said : ' the @entity3 has been dogged by costly it failures , @entity59 ( private finance initiative ) projects and failures to manage its finances properly			2
' it is facing an unprecedented funding squeeze , with billions of pounds to find in a budget which may in itself have a black hole of up to £ 30bn			0
' last year 55,724,785 patients were listed with @entity69 , but only 53,493,729 people were said to be living in this country , costing £ 148m			1
allegations : dr @entity73 was suspended in 2011 after she was found to have ' ghost patients ' on treatment list in @entity76 , @entity77 the system takes time for the systems to update when someone has died			1

@entity98 and @entity99 in @entity100 follow closely behind with 126 %			0

while many are kept on lists accidentally , officials at the watchdog warned that some @entity69 ‘ conveniently forget ’ to remove them			2
in the wake of the 2004 report , the @entity121 ordered family doctors to ‘ cleanse their lists and remove ghost patients but many have failed to do so			0

practice : doctors from @entity135 , in @entity77 ( pictured ) were suspended during an investigation into their practices in one case a family said they had been receiving letters from a surgery addressed to another person for 20 years			0
dr @entity143 , @entity144 ’s head of primary care , said : ' in the majority of cases , gp practices work hard to keep their registered patient lists as accurate as they can and our area teams are working closely with them to achieve this			1
' one of the main issues they face is that patients often fail to notify practices when leaving the area or country and this can mean that so - called ‘ ghost ’ patients remain registered			1
it is really important that patients keep their gps informed if they are changing practices or leaving the area so that their registration can be amended			0
' there can also sometimes be a short time lapse between updating national practice systems when a patient registers with another surgery , which can result in duplication			0
all efforts are made to ensure this is resolved as soon as possible			0

@entity69 are paid £ 66.25 for every patient on their treatment list
@entity91 is worst in the country with 138 % of the population registered
phantom patients may have died or have switched practices
problem is a ' scandalous waste of taxpayer 's money '
