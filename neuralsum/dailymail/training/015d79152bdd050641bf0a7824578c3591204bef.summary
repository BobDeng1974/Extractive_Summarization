president @entity0 has moved closer to military intervention in @entity2 , after stating that the alleged chemical attack by the @entity5 regime last week warranted a ' serious response			1
' @entity0 said time was running out for @entity5 to allow @entity9 weapons inspectors to view the site of the alleged attack near @entity12 , where as many as 1,300 people died on wednesday			1
a government source said @entity0 and @entity16 prime minister @entity15 agreed all options should be kept open , while taking a clear stance that the @entity19 will not abide by chemical weapon attacks on innocent civilians			2
warning : graphic content president @entity0 appeared on @entity24 's ' @entity23 ' on friday to discuss the alleged attack , saying it was a ' big event of grave concern ' that requires @entity30 attention ' they reiterated that significant use of chemical weapons would merit a serious response from the international community and both have tasked officials to examine all the options , ' a @entity16 government spokesman told the @entity40			1
@entity0 had spoken at length to @entity15 on saturday , in a conversation that led him to believe @entity5 was most likely behind the chemical attack			2
his move towards a more serious response comes as four battleships move within striking range of @entity2 , which has been locked in a deadly civil war that has claimed more than 100,000 lives since 2011			2
@entity0 was said to be ' gravely concerned ' by the attack and increasing signs that it was carried out against @entity2 by @entity5 's forces			1
' the fact that president @entity5 has failed to co-operate with the @entity9 suggests that the regime has something to hide , ' a spokesman said			1
the spokesman added that the president and @entity15 , ' reiterated that significant use of chemical weapons would merit a serious response from the international community '			2
' they agreed that it is vital that the world upholds the prohibition on the use of chemical weapons and deters further outrages			2
' the tougher stance comes as @entity30 defense secretary @entity71 told reporters in @entity73 that @entity0 was still considering whether to use military force			1
he said the administration had to account for several factors , including intelligence on the @entity2 attack , legal issues and the level of international support for a military response			2
prepared : @entity71 , right , says the president has ordered the @entity84 to prepare potential military options @entity0 had previously warned a chemical attack would signify @entity5 had crossed a ' red line '			1
defense secretary @entity71 declined to discuss specific force movements but said @entity0 had asked the @entity84 to prepare military options for @entity2			1
@entity30 defense officials told @entity92 that the @entity93 had sent a fourth warship armed with ballistic missiles into the eastern @entity96 but without immediate orders for any missile launch into @entity2			1
@entity93 ships are capable of a variety of military actions , including launching @entity103 cruise missiles , as they did against @entity104 in 2011 as part of an international action that led to the overthrow of the @entity104 government			0
' @entity110 has a responsibility to provide the president with options for contingencies , and that requires positioning our forces , positioning our assets , to be able to carry out different options - whatever options the president might choose , ' @entity109 told reporters traveling with him to @entity124			0
@entity109 said the @entity30 is coordinating with the international community to determine ' what exactly did happen ' near @entity12 earlier this week			0
according to reports , a chemical attack in a suburb of the capital killed at least 100 people			0
it would be the most heinous use of chemical weapons since @entity136 leader @entity135 gassed thousands of @entity137 in the town of @entity139 in 1988			0
@entity109 left little doubt that he thinks the attack in @entity2 involved chemical weapons , although he stressed there is not yet a final answer			1
in discussing the matter , he said , ' it appears to be what happened - use of chemical weapons			2
' escalation : @entity151 , the @entity9 's high representative for disarmament , arrives in @entity12 , @entity2 on saturday to press president @entity5 to let @entity9 investigators look into the reported chemical attack four battleships have been moved to within striking range of @entity2 as president @entity0 weighs his options following a reported use of chemical weapons against citizens on wednesday @entity9 disarmament chief , @entity151 , arrived in @entity12 on saturday to press the @entity2 government to allow @entity9 experts to investigate the alleged chemical attacks			1
@entity0 remained cautious about getting involved in a war that has killed more than 100,000 people and now includes @entity168 and @entity169			0
he made no mention of the ' red line ' of chemical weapons use that he marked out for @entity2 president @entity5 a year ago and that @entity30 intelligence says has been breached at least on a small scale several times since			1
' if the @entity30 goes in and attacks another country without a @entity9 mandate and without clear evidence that can be presented , then there are questions in terms of whether international law supports it - do we have the coalition to make it work ? ' @entity0 said friday			2
' those are considerations that we have to take into account			0
' @entity0 conceded in an interview on @entity24 's ' @entity23 ' program that the episode is a ' big event of grave concern ' that requires @entity30 attention			0
he said any large - scale chemical weapons usage would affect ' core national interests ' of the @entity30 and its allies			0
but nothing he said signaled a shift toward @entity30 action			0
@entity30 defense officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were n't authorized to discuss ship movements publicly			0
but if the @entity30 wants to send a message to @entity5 , the most likely military action would be a @entity103 missile strike , launched from a ship in the @entity96			1
for a year now , @entity0 has threatened to punish @entity5 's regime if it resorted to its chemical weapons arsenal , among the world 's vastest , saying use or even deployment of such weapons of mass destruction constituted a ' red line ' for him			1
a @entity30 intelligence assessment concluded in june chemical weapons have been used in @entity2 's civil war , but @entity219 has taken no military action against @entity5 's forces			1
@entity30 officials have instead focused on trying to organize a peace conference between the government and opposition			0
@entity0 has authorized weapons deliveries to rebel groups , but none are believed to have been sent so far			0
calling @entity5 a ' thug ' and a ' murderer , ' @entity229 declared , ' history would judge us all extraordinarily harshly if we turned a blind eye to a dictator 's use of chemical weapons			2
' ' evidence ' : secretary of state @entity229 said images like these contributed to the @entity30 assessment that chemical weapons were used in @entity2 in his first comments on @entity2 since the alleged chemical attack , @entity0 said the @entity30 was still trying to find out what happened			1
@entity109 said on friday that a determination on the chemical attack should be made swiftly because ' there may be another attack coming , ' although he added that ' we do n't know ' whether that will happen			0
after rebels similarly reported chemical attacks in february , @entity30 confirmation took more than four months			0
in this instance , a @entity9 chemical weapons team is already on the ground in @entity2			1
@entity5 's government , then as now , has rejected the claims as baseless			0
@entity0 also cited the need for the @entity30 to be part of a coalition in dealing with @entity2			0
@entity30 's ability by itself to solve the @entity265 country 's sectarian fighting is ' overstated , ' he said .			0

president @entity0 said to be weighing military options after warning @entity5 chemical weapons use would be crossing a ' red line '
defense secretary @entity71 said nerve gas attack needs to be verified but that it ' appears to be what happened '
@entity9 representative @entity151 arrived in @entity2 today to ask president @entity5 to let investigators into the country to look into the claim
military officials told @entity92 four battleships have been moved within striking zone of @entity2 and could be used for @entity103 missile attack
