the concern is that if an anaesthetic is given to a young child , it could damage brain cells whenever a young child has an operation , it ’s a worry for their parents			1
but studies are now giving another reason for concern : youngsters who ’ve had a general anaesthetic may be more likely to suffer behavioural problems and learning disabilities			2
a growing body of research shows that going under a general anaesthetic before the age of four raises the risk of cognitive problems and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( @entity23 )			1
one paper found that children who ’d had two general anaesthetics were 50 per cent more likely to develop learning difficulties			1
questions about how sedatives affect the brains of young children are now so pressing that anaesthetists in the @entity33 , @entity34 and across the world are joining forces to find answers			1
in life - threatening situations , surgery on children is unavoidable			2
but one of the goals of the joint research initiative , called @entity44 , is to clarify the advice and help parents decide whether to delay routine surgery on their off - spring			1
this includes operations for hernias , birthmark removal , circumcisions and tonsil removal , and to insert tubes to drain ear infections			1
although the @entity58 ’s official policy has not changed , the @entity33 ’s @entity56 says several hospitals are already delaying some non-emergency surgery on young children to avoid any possible risk			1
among the studies raising concern is a recent paper by the @entity64 in the @entity34 , which links anaesthesia to behavioural issues			2
it found that ‘ multiple exposures to anaesthesia before the age of two are a significant risk factor for the development of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ’			2
this follows research published in the journal @entity78 in 2009 , which found children who had two general anaesthetics before the age of four are 50 per cent more likely to develop disabilities in reading , writing and maths			1
the study also found the number of times the children were sedated and how long for was a factor			1
if a child was under for an operation lasting less than two hours , there was no risk			1
however if a child had three or more operations , there was a much greater likelihood of learning problems			1
dr @entity100 , an anaesthetist at @entity101 in the @entity102 , looked at the outcomes of 2,868 children born between 1989 and 1992			0
more than 320 were sedated for operations or diagnostic surgery before they were three			2
he found that children who received anaesthesia early in life were 87 per cent more likely to have language problems and nearly 70 per cent more likely to have cognitive problems at the age of ten , compared with those who had not been sedated			0
just one exposure to anaesthesia was associated with more of a risk			0
he also discovered that not all of the brain was affected in the same way			0
language and abstract reasoning suffered the most , while behaviour and motor skills were n’t affected			0
although it is still not known exactly how anaesthetics work , they are believed to act in the same way on children and adults — by blocking the signals passing along nerves			0
the concern is that if an anaesthetic is given to a young child — whose brain is still developing — it could damage brain cells			0
there are similar worries about older people			0
last year a @entity141 study suggested that over- 65s who ’d had a general anaesthetic in the previous two years were more likely to develop dementia			2
a recent study carried out at the @entity64 in the @entity34 found children who 'd had two general anaesthetics were 50 per cent more likely to develop learning difficulties			1
the study also found if a child 's operation lasted less than two hours there was no risk , while three or more surgeries increased the chances one theory is that the anaesthetic may contribute to brain inflammation , thus encouraging the production of amyloid plaques — clumps of protein that are linked to alzheimer ’s disease			1
dr @entity164 of the @entity165 says : ‘ every time you have an anaesthetic in surgery there is a risk			0
’ but he adds : ‘ there may be a special risk for children under the age of four			0
that is obviously a really important time for the development of kids ’ brains			0
’ under present @entity33 guidelines , parents are not told about the latest concerns about sedating children unless they specifically ask			0
some doctors are starting to question if they should legally discuss the issue with families so they can make a more informed decision			0
however , many experts believe it ’s too early to change the policy , especially as many childhood surgeries are impossible to avoid , and delaying an operation could be more serious for a youngster ’s health			1
for example , holding off ear surgery might cause hearing difficulties that could slow down a child ’s ability to talk and listen — which could have a long - term impact on their learning			1
anaesthesiology professor @entity204 , who has pioneered research into the effect of sedatives on children , says if non-emergency surgery can be delayed until after the child is four without causing serious harm , then it is justified			1
she has also called for doctors to minimise , where possible , the number of times children are sedated and how long for , to reduce any potential impact			0
several hospitals in the @entity33 are already delaying some non-urgent operations , including hernias , tonsil removal and birthmark removal , to reduce the risks ‘ the momentum of the data suggests that the concern is a potentially real one , ’ she says			1
because of the ethics of research on youngsters , and the difficulties in measuring cognitive levels in very young children , the number of studies is still low			1
however , seven studies of young primates have found ‘ emerging evidence ’ that their brains are more vulnerable to damage from anaesthetics than adults			2
researchers believe that anaesthetics cause more damage in the young because their brains are at a crucial stage of development , when the cells are trying to make many new connections			0
dr @entity249 , at the @entity250 in the @entity34 , has been looking at the effects of ketamine — a sedative often used on children — on the learning ability of young rhesus monkeys			2
she says : ‘ earlier research showed that exposing young rat pups to ketamine caused learning problems when they became adults , but we wanted to see what would happen with primates			2
‘ the learning of concepts such as matching — see a triangle and match it with another triangle from among other symbols — took much longer in the ketamine - treated monkeys			0
’ the impact appeared to be long - term , she added			0
‘ even after basic concepts were learned , the ketamine - exposed animals performed less accurately than animals in the control group			0
‘ six years after their ketamine treatment , they ’re still showing below - normal brain function			0

one study found children who 'd had two general anaesthetics were 50 *%* more likely to develop learning difficulties
new research to clarify the advice and help parents decide whether to delay routine operations for hernias , birthmark removal and tonsil removal

@entity64 study found if a child 's operation lasted less than two hours there was no risk but if a child had three surgeries the risk increased
