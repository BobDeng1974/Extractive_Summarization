a mother 's face swelled to twice its normal size when she had an extreme allergic reaction to a hair dye			1
@entity5 almost lost her sight and even feared for her life as boils erupted all over her body			1
she said she did the recommended patch test before using the @entity11 home dye kit in the shade ‘ @entity13 ’			1
she took an antihistamine and went to bed , but the next morning she awoke to discover she had swollen up and developed oozing boils			2
her gp told her she was having a mild allergic reaction , and sent her home with antibiotics to recover			2

mrs @entity5 , 39 , was again told the reaction would settle and was sent home to recover			1
mrs @entity5 , having dyed her hair since her late teens , said had not been worried about the risks - especially as she had performed the patch test manufacturers recommend for safety reasons but within minutes of applying the dye , her scalp was burning , and by the end of the night she was in agony she is normally a full - time carer for her husband @entity54 , 32 , but he ended up looking after her as her condition worsened to the point where the skin on her face began to peel off and her eyes glazed over with a thick jelly - like substance			1
