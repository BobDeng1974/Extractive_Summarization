by @entity0 published : 07:24 est , 15 november 2012 updated : 10:52 est , 15 november 2012 the @entity4 's @entity3 - watching @entity2 satellite has sent back incredible footage of three partial solar eclipses as seen from @entity8 's orbit			1
during a total solar eclipse , like the one seen from @entity10 on tuesday night , the @entity9 moves between the @entity8 and the @entity3 , its alignment such that it appears large enough to block out the @entity3 's rays			1
since @entity2 orbits @entity8 about 14.5 times per day , it can dip in and out of the @entity9 ’s shadow around the time of a solar eclipse			1
black hole sun : one of the images of monday night 's eclipse as seen by the @entity4 's @entity2 satellite			1
the images taken by the satellite 's swap imager , which snaps the @entity3 in ultraviolet light wo n't you come : the uv images reveal stormy active regions on the @entity3 's face , including sunspots , the roots of some large solar flares and coronal mass ejections that are occasionally directed towards @entity8 and wash away the rain ? since @entity2 orbits @entity8 about 14.5 times per day , it can dip in and out of the @entity9 's shadow around the time of a solar eclipse the constant change in viewing angle of @entity2 meant that the satellite passed through the shadow three times during tuesday 's eclipse			1
however , as the @entity3 was never completely covered up from @entity2 ’s vantage point , each eclipse was only partial			1
the video was produced from images taken by @entity2 ’s @entity24 , which snaps the @entity3 in ultraviolet light revealing stormy active regions on the @entity3 ’s face , including sunspots , the roots of some large solar flares and coronal mass ejections that are occasionally directed towards @entity8			1
the apparent noise in the movie is caused by high energy particles hitting @entity2 's electronics as the spacecraft passes through the @entity63			2
the dimming in the movie is an effect as part of the satellite 's orbit passes through the shadow of the @entity8			2
the @entity2 satellite : the @entity3 - watching satellite only saw partial eclipses as the @entity3 was never completely covered up from its vantage point in the @entity8 's orbit @entity76 , @entity2 mission manager , said : ' the satellite also spent hours collecting data of the solar environment further away from the @entity3 before and after the main eclipse event , providing context for the ground - based observations			1
' from boats bobbing on the @entity88 to hot air balloons hovering over the rainforest , and the hilltops and beaches in between , tens of thousands of scientists , tourists and amateur astronomers watched in awe as the sun , moon and @entity8 aligned and plunged northern @entity10 into darkness			0
forecasters were predicting cloudy skies around dawn wednesday , but it did n't materialise , allowing stargazers to experience it unhindered			0
the eclipse began at 05.45 in the far north of the @entity10 state , with totality occurring at 06.38 on november 14 ( 20.38 gmt )			0
' immediately before , i was thinking , " are we gon na see this ? " and we just had a fantastic display - it was just beautiful , ' said @entity111 of the @entity112 of @entity113 , who has seen a dozen total solar eclipses over the years			0
' and right after it finished , the clouds came back again			0
' it really adds to the drama of it			0
' observing in visible light extremely close to the solar surface is only possible from the ground during eclipses when the bright solar disc is temporarily obscured			0
this briefly exposes the @entity3 ’s bright atmosphere , or corona , and the red glow of the chromosphere			2
' combining visible light observations with the extreme ultraviolet images from @entity2 gives us a unique opportunity to access difficult - to - see regions of the @entity3 at different wavelengths , during a rare event such as a total solar eclipse , ' mr @entity76 added			1
observers on the ground watched in awe as darkness swept across the land for a little over 2 minutes			0
the eclipse began at 05.45 in the far north of @entity113 , with totality occurring at 06.38 on november 14 ( 20.38 on november 13 in @entity146 )			0
@entity2 scientist @entity147 watched the event with thousands of others along the @entity10 coast at @entity151			0
' we got all a bit nervous when after sunrise the partially eclipsed @entity3 was covered by a big cloud , but 5 minutes before totality , the cloud dissolved and we could watch " @entity162 ’s beads " form – the effect where beads of sunlight shine through the rugged lunar landscape , ' said mr @entity147			2
' at totality we could see the red chromosphere and the corona in the most beautiful conditions – it was fantastic ! ' dramatic : near totality is seen during the solar eclipse at @entity151 , @entity10 , where thousands of eclipse - watchers gathered to view the phenomenon , the first in @entity10 in a decade @entity10 will have another chance to see a solar eclipse in may 2013 , although because the @entity9 will be slightly further away from the @entity8 , it wo n’t block the whole @entity3 , resulting in an ‘ annular eclipse ’			2
@entity176 will have to wait until november 2013 before the opportunity arises to see a partial solar eclipse across much of the south			0
meanwhile , @entity4 ’s fleet of @entity3 - watching spacecraft will continue to monitor the @entity3 ’s stormy behaviour as it unleashes its plasma load out into space and towards @entity8			1
scientists will get even closer to the action in 2017 with the launch of @entity188 , which will travel to observe the @entity3 from a daring distance of just 26million miles - that 's inside the orbit of planet @entity192 , our system 's innermost planet .			2

the @entity4 's @entity2 satellite dipped in and out of the @entity9 's shadow three times during monday night 's eclipse
it captured images in *ultra-violet* , revealing stormy active regions on the @entity3 ’s face , including sunspots and solar flares
