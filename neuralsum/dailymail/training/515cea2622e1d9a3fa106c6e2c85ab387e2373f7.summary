by @entity0 for months the art world has breathed a collective sigh of relief as they have been spared the withering pronouncements of @entity7 ’s leading art critic			2
now @entity8 has spoken for the first time of the cancer that has led to his absence from public life – and revealed how an operation to remove the tumour left him with what he calls ‘ my @entity17 ear ’			1
and as he recovers from surgery , mr @entity8 , 82 , has lost none of his feared acerbic wit , taking aim at @entity23 director sir @entity22 and labelling famed art historian @entity24 a ‘ fraud ’			1
@entity8 has spoken for the first time of the cancer that has led to his absence from public life in an operation last week , mr @entity8 had his right ear virtually removed and then re-attached so the tumour could be taken out , leaving him with a ‘ disconcerting ’ feeling			1
‘ it feels to me as though it is slightly misplaced , ’ he said , jokingly likening it to the way @entity17 rearranged features in his @entity37 portraits			2
mr @entity8 said he first noticed a ‘ small and squishy ’ lump behind his ear in january , but ignored it			1
but after it grew increasing painful , he went to his gp and was referred to specialists at the @entity44 in @entity45 , @entity46			0
doctors found what he called a ‘ tiresome ’ tumour in his neck , and initially believed it could easily be removed			1
but after further tumours were found in his lungs and ‘ what they rather vulgarly called my gut ’ , a planned operation was delayed , and he feared he was facing ‘ the kiss of death ’			1
at one stage , he believed his condition was inoperable and terminal			0
but he did not contemplate suicide – despite an article he wrote for @entity64 last year , in which he had endorsed assisted suicide for those with terminal conditions and said he might one day take ‘ pills and gin ’ to take his own life			2
his surgeon then decided he could operate , but warned of what mr @entity8 calls the ‘ ghastly prospect ’ that they might sever his facial nerve and leave him badly disfigured			1
happily , the operation was successful			2
although mr @entity8 now faces months of radiotherapy , he said he is now ‘ relieved , ebullient and hugely grateful ’ that ‘ my life has been given back to me ’			1
' @entity80 ' : the artist 's portrait of a jug - eared @entity83 his sense of mischief is undimmed as he teased enemies such as the @entity23 ’s sir @entity22 , whom he has repeatedly vilified for championing modern art. mr @entity8 joked : ‘ the one consolation i have is that i have frustrated the @entity90 by surviving the operation			1
i have not gone yet			0
’ he also described attending the @entity7 exhibition @entity24 : @entity93 , and declared : ‘ i thought what an old fraud this man was			0
he had absolutely no eye			2
it aroused my anger , which is perhaps a healthy thing			0
’ speaking from the @entity102 home he shares with his beloved dogs @entity99 and @entity100 , mr @entity8 said the operation had left him with vivid scars around his ear and down his neck			1
‘ it looks pretty vile , ’ he admitted			0
‘ it looks like we are in the @entity111 and the @entity112 and someone has attempted rather badly to chop my head off			0
i have the feeling that there are lots of tiny men surrounding my ear who are tugging it to try to get it back to where it should be			2
’ he also insisted that his brush with death had not changed his approach to art : ‘ i do n’t feel that because i might be dying i should be charitable			0
’ with his thoughts turned towards mortality , he has considered what will happen to his body after death			0
‘ i wish i could leave it to @entity135 , ’ he said			0
‘ i really do n’t see why dog lovers should n’t end up as dogs ’ dinners			0
