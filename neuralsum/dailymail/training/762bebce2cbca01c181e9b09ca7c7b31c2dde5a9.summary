by @entity0 published : 17:39 est , 6 november 2013 updated : 18:12 est , 6 november 2013 @entity1 has spent millions relaunching its @entity3 range after discovering shoppers were turning to @entity5 , @entity6 and @entity7 's for upmarket treats			1
from hand - decorated cakes worthy of the @entity10 to pies filled with the best ale and berries , the revamped range , which went on sale this month , is clearly aimed at wooing affluent customers			1
but will it work ? or is @entity1 inextricably linked in shoppers ’ eyes with budget fare ? @entity21 cook @entity23 taste - tested the new @entity1 products against similar high - end items from @entity7 ’s ( which has a rival taste @entity28 range ) , @entity5 and @entity6 to find out which supermarket 's food really is the finest			1
taste tester : @entity0 with a selection of supermarket foods fabulous : @entity34 @entity35 , 113g , £ 1.50 oh dear , not a good start			1
this pate is very sweet and does n’t taste of smoked duck at all - not surprising , as it is mostly made of duck liver and pork fat			1
1/5 @entity7 ’s @entity41 with @entity42 , 170g , £ 2.15 a traditional pate that transports me to a @entity46 charcuterie - creamy with back - notes of orange from the @entity42			1
the slightly spongy texture disappoints			0
3/5 @entity50 , 170g , £ 1.49 savoury and rich , with a lovely warmth that comes from the addition of @entity54			0
does n't look particularly appealing , but tastes utterly yummy			2
4/5 @entity34 , 80g , £ 3.99 this is pricey but so pretty in its little jar - as well as being delicious			2
push aside the buttery seal to reveal a silky pate with layers of flavour - savoury , sweet , creamy , with a warm cognac finish			2
5/5 winner : @entity5 @entity64 , £ 3 for two moist and fluffy , with a lovely smoky flavour from the undyed haddock , and a good crumb			1
there ’s a gooey , cheesey middle , too : unnecessary , but luxurious			0
4/5 @entity7 's @entity70 with @entity71 and @entity72 , £ 2.99 for two comforting , but tastes like potato flavoured with leek and cheese - i can barely detect the fish			1
3/5 @entity78 , £ 4 for two like a fish pie in a ball shape ! the combination of fish flavours works well , but the salmon is dry and i 'm sure i am detecting little pieces of undercooked onion			0
3/5 @entity87 with @entity71 and @entity88 , £ 4.19 for two these look impressive , but are disappointingly bland			0
they have lots of fish , but it does n't taste of anything			2
the overwhelming flavour is lemon from the sauce			0
2/5 winner : @entity1 @entity98 and @entity99 , 400g , £ 3.25 is this a quiche ? all i can taste is the chilli in the pastry ( not nice ) and the smoky chorizo on a thin eggy layer			1
it ’s more like a pizza			0
1/5 @entity7 's @entity108 , 170g , £ 1.90 very good			1
large pieces of light , fresh goat ’s cheese atop spinach - flecked custard in a buttery pastry			2
4/5 @entity115 , @entity116 and @entity117 , £ 2.29 this looks rather patchy and tastes delicious - crisp , perfect pastry and sweet tomatoes that contrast well with the salty feta			1
5/5 @entity124 and @entity123 , 400g , £ 3.49 a good traditional quiche with a twist - the balsamic onions give a sweetness that works well with the cheese			2
the pastry is too thick for the thin filling layer , though			0
3/5 winner : @entity6 sausage test : @entity5 is the winner when it comes to the best tasting sausages @entity137 and @entity138 , £ 2.99 for six a good proportion of pork - 74 per cent , but the onion makes them too sweet			1
children will love them , but they are not savoury enough for me			0
3/5 @entity7 's @entity147 and @entity148 , £ 3 for six the 77 per cent pork makes these a decent sausage , but they are also very sweet from the onions , and the addition of onion powder gives them an artificial flavour			1
good herby notes , though			0
3/5 @entity157 , £ 3.79 for six these are like sausages your butcher would make			0
they have a whopping 90 per cent pork and no rusk or breadcrumbs , so they are uber - meaty			2
very ' piggy ' - amazing if you like that kind of thing			2
4/5 @entity171 with @entity172 , £ 3 for six these are really meaty - 80 per cent pork - with just the right amount of caramelised onion flavour			2
5/5 winner : @entity5 @entity179 and @entity180 , 340g , £ 1.65 not spicy enough for me and rather sweet , this is also slightly gloopy , probably from the addition of potato starch			1
3/5 @entity7 's @entity185 and @entity180 , 330g , £ 1.65 @entity187 with a good flavour , this has a great chilli kick and a natural taste - but it is on the greasy side , with a film of oil on top			1
4/5 @entity196 , 340g , £ 1.99 this has a lovely bright colour and is fresh - tasting with a big chilli hit			2
it tastes home - made and has no additives			1
5/5 @entity204 , 555g , £ 2.49 i like the colour and fresh flavour of this , but it is lacking salt and - crucially - sugar , making it bland and too acidic			2
3/5 winner : @entity6 @entity212 and @entity213 £ 3.20 this looks very cute , coming , as it does , in a little flower pot. it 's only a shame the pot is plastic and the pie is horrid ! the pastry is too soggy underneath and the gravy is gloopy and bitter with the meat disintegrated into it			1
back to the drawing board			0
1/5 @entity7 's @entity226 , £ 3 a well - filled pie with lots of pieces of meat in good gravy			1
the pastry is a little too thick , but it 's tasty - made with lard as well as butter			1
4/5 @entity236 and @entity237 , £ 3.49 dangerously delicious - i dare you to try this pie and not finish it			0
well - browned , soft meat chunks in a proper beery onion gravy within fantastic pastry			0
5/5 @entity245 and @entity246 , £ 2.99 not enough meat and too much gravy			0
the flavour of the sauce is good , but the pastry is greasy			0
2/5 winner : @entity6 @entity254 , £ 10 stunning looking cake with three layers of moist , chocolatey sponge and lots of divine cream - cheese frosting , finished with striking red crumbs			1
5/5 @entity7 's @entity262 , £ 1.35 for two @entity263 , yet so disappointing			1
the sponge tastes as if it 's full of additives - which it is - and the buttercream is sickly sweet			1
did anyone taste these first ? 0/5 too sweet : @entity269 , left , but @entity254 is superb @entity270 , £ 4.99 a treat for chocolate lovers , made of layers of vanilla sponge , buttercream and brownies			0
4/5 @entity269 , £ 4.29 like a carrot cake with added pineapple and coconut			0
i expect it to be moist , but it ’s on the dry side and very sweet			0
the passion - fruit frosting is too sugary			0
2/5 winner : @entity1 @entity287 , £ 4.40 stylish with its red topping , this has a good cherry flavour that works well with the vanilla filling			2
but the cheesecake is too set			0
4/5 @entity7 's @entity295 @entity294 , £ 3 a very creamy , silky topping on a great biscuit base			1
just a point lost for its unimpressive looks			0
4/5 @entity88 and @entity298 , £ 4 love the crunchy topping , love the base , love the lemon and raspberry combo			0
but where 's the creamy stuff in the middle ? 3/5 @entity306 , £ 3.79 oh			0
@entity310 it , though , for this dreamy , creamy concoction that is like a divinely silky chocolate mousse on a biscuity base			0
5/5 winner : @entity5 @entity5 and @entity6 share the top prize , as each come top in three categories			1
@entity1 is close behind with two - still well ahead of @entity7 's , which does n't manage to win a single category			1
@entity3 ? it would appear not .			0

@entity1 has spent millions relaunching its finest range
@entity21 cook @entity0 taste - tested their new products
she pitted them against similar high - end items from @entity7 's , @entity5 and @entity6
