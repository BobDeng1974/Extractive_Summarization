by @entity0 follow @ @ samcunningham @entity1 is remembered fondly on the red half of @entity3 as @entity4 , for his decade playing at the heart of @entity8 ’s defence			1
but since he has turned to football management his approach has drawn comparison more with @entity13 manager @entity12 than @entity15 boss @entity14 , the original @entity14			1
those who work closely with the @entity17 describe a manager who knows what he wants , demands high standards and carries an air of authority wherever he goes			1
losing hurts him , they say , even if it is just in a pre-season friendly			1
new man at the top : @entity1 is tasked with leading @entity29 's promotion charge when @entity29 started to look for a replacement for the departing @entity32 , they wanted a modern manager suitable for their structure and philosophy — a hybrid of the continental model , where the man in charge focuses on little else other than the team , and the more traditional @entity43 style where the manager does practically everything			1
after an exhaustive recruitment process led by chairman @entity47 and chief executive @entity48 , @entity1 emerged as an early favourite			1
they interviewed those who played with him and played for him , who coached him and had been coached by him , anyone he had come into contact with in the game			1
and the pair agreed on the 40 - year - old , who has evolved from the scruffy yet formidable centre back signed by @entity60 in 1999 into a suave manager			1
his face is one not to be messed with ; nose slightly bent from too many tussles with centre forwards and chiselled cheekbones			2
fierce competitor : @entity1 was a formidable centre back during his time at @entity8 landing a manager who had just spent two years in charge at @entity73 side @entity72 , including leading them into the @entity75 before he was sacked in april , was a statement of intent			1
speak to people at @entity29 and they talk of being ‘ @entity79 ready ’			2
they have just opened a £ 32million academy and training ground which has been awarded the highest score ever by the @entity79 ’s independent auditors			2
their £ 93million , 30,500 - capacity stadium has had the highest average championship gates in the past two seasons			2
winning mentality : @entity1 was part of the @entity8 team that lifted the @entity75 in 2005 @entity48 handles the commercial side and negotiations for the biggest deals , head of football @entity95 runs every other department and @entity1 has to rubber - stamp it all while focusing on his team			1
they all report directly to @entity47			2
@entity95 worked behind the scenes at @entity101 between 2010 and 2012			2
previously he was in @entity103 ’s recruitment department and before that worked on @entity106 ’s now flourishing academy			2
@entity95 said : ‘ what sold the club to @entity4 was not only everything in place with the structure from the continental model , like he had in @entity113 , but that he gets the choice on everything , like the @entity117 model			0
everyone takes direction from the manager but then leaves him to concentrate on getting the team ready for the next game			0
in the hotseat : @entity1 took over following the departure of @entity32 ‘ @entity101 is a fair comparison to how it works			1
this system is designed so there is minimal distraction for the manager			0
‘ we do n’t say you have to sign this player or we ’re going to sell that one , if he wants scouting reports or suggestions of players we provide them			0
’ at @entity72 , @entity137 lost @entity138 to @entity139 for £ 18m , but he was then replaced by a player at a fraction of that fee			0
he admits he had very little say in any transfers			0
but he is so comfortable with @entity29 ’s model he has brought in just one member of staff so far — goalkeeping coach @entity148			0
summer signing : @entity150 has arrived on a free transfer after being released by @entity152 he has also made four signings since joining , including @entity150 , who played at @entity106 under @entity12 and sees similarities in his new manager ’s meticulous approach			1
@entity150 said : ‘ sometimes it was repetitive , but you saw the success we had at @entity106 and i see some of the same things here			0
’ now 34 , @entity150 was plying his trade in the @entity79 when @entity1 was winning the @entity75 , @entity163 , @entity164 and @entity165			1
@entity48 added : ‘ his work ethic , commitment and desire are frankly what you expect from someone who has played the game at the highest level			0
he ’s hit the ground running			0
‘ one thing we ’ve noticed is that he ’s a winner			0
losing pre-season friendlies bothers him , it hurts him			0
it ’s a character trait we like			0
’ the minimum expectation this season is to reach the play - offs , where they have fallen short in the last two campaigns			0
if @entity1 is the final piece in the jigsaw to make @entity29 ‘ @entity79 ready ’ , @entity4 could soon be joining @entity14 on the top - flight touchline .			1
