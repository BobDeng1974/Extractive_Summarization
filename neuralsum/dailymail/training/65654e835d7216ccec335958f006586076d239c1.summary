by @entity0 one of the delights , on a recent @entity3 holiday , was strolling among lemon trees in the hotel garden			1
they grew in huge antique pots that lined the pathways so guests could enjoy their perfume			2
@entity11 is too cold for citrus trees to live outdoors permanently , but we 've nurtured them here for 300 years			1
in @entity17 times , potted oranges were set out for display each summer			2
in autumn , they were crammed into glazed orangeries or greenhouses			2
an orange drizzle cake will taste fantastic when flavoured with home - grown juice and zest few of us have orangeries , but anyone can grow citrus plants			1
you could manage a kumquat on a windowsill while a city balcony might be mild enough for a nearhardy calamondin orange or even a lemon , if temperatures stay above 2c			1
you might pick only two lemons a year , but a drizzle cake will taste fantastic when flavoured with home - grown juice and zest			0
you can buy citrus trees in any season			1
try the @entity40 at @entity41 , @entity42 ( citrus centre.co.uk ) , or @entity45 's @entity44 ( victoriananursery.co.uk )			1
mail order suppliers @entity46 and @entity48 also sell them			0
@entity50 it up for citrus bushes on the cheap , plant the pips			1
it 's great fun — children love growing them — and they make attractive plants with aromatic leaves and fragrant flowers			0
but unlike named or grafted varieties , they are unlikely to bear edible fruit			1
the procedure could n't be simpler			0
save pips from an orange , mandarin , grapefruit or lemon			1
if you find a pip showing some green , treasure it — this will grow more quickly than a dormant seed			1
fill a 7cm pot with compost , firm it gently , water thoroughly and let it drain			1
then insert up to five pips into the damp compost , making sure they 're just covered			1
put the pots somewhere warm — a heated propagator is ideal , but a windowsill is nearly as good — and keep the soil moist , but not saturated			0
when the seedlings have grown large enough to handle , pot them up individually			0
@entity40 trees prefer slightly acid soils , so grow them in specially formulated citrus compost — ericaceous compost is the next best thing			1
the leaves on young plants are attractive and aromatic from the start			0
but blossom may not appear for a year or two and the growth habits of such seedlings are unpredictable			0
juicy choices if you want fruit as well as beauty , the calamondin orange is the best entry level variety			1
if happy , they produce flowers and fruit constantly , and though these are too sharp to eat raw , they 're brilliant for marmalade			2
among lemons , the thinskinned , uber - juicy @entity110 is prized , but it 's not the easiest to grow			2
so , if you 're a novice , try the rugged @entity113 instead			0
its huge , thick - skinned fruit are ideal for making candied peel			2
@entity117 lives up to its name , providing flowers and fruit for much of the year			2
@entity121 trees are less successful as they need @entity123 sun to make the fruit sweet and juicy			1
and if you grow grapefruit , limes or clementines from pips , you can enjoy the leaf aromas even if they never bear decent fruit			1
kumquats , though , are highly productive as well as pretty			0
they need constant warmth , so are best kept indoors all year round			0
the small oval fruits can be eaten whole — soft peel and all			0
to experience citrus heaven , dipa kumquat into molten chocolate			2
mmmmm ! you can buy a collection of six heleniums for £ 8.99 or 12 for £ 17.98 and receive a further six free			0
each collection comprises two each of @entity146 , @entity147 and @entity148			0
to order by debit / credit card , call 0844 472 4161 , quoting @entity151 , or visit mailgardenshop.co.uk			0
or send a cheque made payable to @entity154 to : @entity155 , @entity151 , 14 - 16 @entity156 , @entity157 , @entity159 @entity158 .			0
