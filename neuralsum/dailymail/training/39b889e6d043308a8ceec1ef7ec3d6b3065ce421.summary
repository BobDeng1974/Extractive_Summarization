by @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 published : 05:41 est , 8 august 2012 updated : 06:39 est , 9 august 2012 uncomfortable : @entity3 , pictured , was questioned on live radio by a cancer - sufferer who asked him to justify why so much money was going on foreign aid a cancer sufferer yesterday launched a scathing attack on @entity3 for increasing @entity13 ’s foreign aid bill while the @entity14 fails to fund cancer treatment she desperately needs			1
the 68 - year - old grandmother took the prime minister to task over his decision to send £ 12billion abroad in foreign aid rather than spending it on helping people at home			1
the woman , who suffers from @entity27 ’s lymphoma , used the name @entity29 during a radio phone - in and refused to give her real name because some of her family do not know she is ill. she said her chemotherapy had beaten back the cancer , but she proved to be dangerously allergic to the rituximab antibody drug given to her to counter side effects of the treatment			1
instead , she needs ofatumumab but said the @entity14 refuses to fund it			0
buying a two - year course of the drug would cost £ 250,000 , completely out of her reach , she said , so her doctors are currently applying to charities in a desperate bid to raise the funds			1
@entity29 had been a full - time carer for her retired engineer husband , but they are so ill he has been forced to go into a care home			1
she is living alone at her home in @entity53 , north @entity54 , on only £ 68 per week			2
the mother of three tearfully challenged mr @entity3 to justify why so much money was going on foreign aid			2
‘ no foreign aid is being cut , and i ’m a cancer victim or patient waiting for treatment that ’s not on the @entity62 , and my local authority , health authority is begging charities for my treatment , ’ she said			2
scroll down to listen to the interview ‘ now , i had my last chemotherapy in may – and it ’s a horrible feeling , waking every morning , waiting for £ 250,000 when they ’re giving billions away abroad			1
' it ’s not fair			0
i need some funding now			0
’ the government has pledged to increase foreign aid to 0.7 per cent of gross domestic product by 2013			0
but the decision to increase aid spending by 34 per cent to £ 12billion over four years at a time of austerity at home has proved massively controversial with both the public and many @entity82 mps			0
there are huge discrepancies in the quality of care that patients across the @entity13 receive stemming simply from where they live			1
among the reasons for this are a lack of funding for some @entity93 , lack of qualified medical staff or even certain drugs not made available in certain areas for example , patients with suspected cancer in parts of @entity101 are 60 times more likely to be sent for scans than those living elsewhere , according to a study by the @entity106 in july			2
patients with diseases that are relatively simple to control such as diabetes , arthritis and eye conditions often miss out on the medication they need simply because there is a lack of local resources			0
previous findings suggested a stark contrast in the rate of the prescribing anti-dementia drugs , with patients in some parts of the country prescribed 25 times as many treatments and tablets to help ' temporarily improve or stabilise symptoms ' than in @entity127			2
one possible reason for such disparities is a lack of awareness on the part of some some local gps have in spotting @entity134 's early			2
in december @entity135 , the health secretary , told @entity133 that ' the degree of variation is considerable , and unexplained by simple differences in population '			0
@entity141 is still receiving nearly £ 300million from @entity13 taxpayers in aid , for example , despite the country being rich enough to launch its own space programme			1
mr @entity3 , appearing on @entity147 , said he would look at her case			1
but he added : ‘ we made a promise as a country to meet pledges on aid and we ’re keeping those promises , and i think breaking your promises to the poorest people in the world would not be the right thing to do			2
‘ the second thing : as i say , i think we do have a moral obligation to help the poorest in the world ... even when there are difficult times for us			1
‘ we have not cut spending to the @entity14 we have increased it			0
' we have the cancer drugs fund and we are looking to extend that			0
’ later , @entity29 told the @entity170 she was ‘ consumed with grief ’ because she could not care for her husband , while her grandchildren were frightened of her wig			1
she said : ‘ i understand what he is saying , but i would say to him if your family is starving you would n’t go and feed your neighbours			2
' he should be looking after people here			2
’ she added : ‘ the doctors have told me i ’m a prime candidate for successful treatment			0
’ health officials yesterday insisted that the @entity186 should be able to cover the type of treatment that @entity29 needs as the drug ofatumumab , also known as @entity190 , is on the approved list for the @entity54 region			1
this means it should be approved if a cancer specialist applies on behalf of a patient			0
a spokesman for @entity14 @entity54 said last night that it was investigating the case			0
‘ our initial investigations have shown us that we have not had any contact from her , ’ he said			0
space programme : @entity141 's maiden lunar mission @entity206 takes off from the @entity207 in 2008 last year it was announced @entity13 would give more than £ 1billion in aid to @entity141 over the next four years , even though it has almost three times as many billionaires as we do			1
ministers claimed the decision to hand around £ 280million a year in taxpayers ’ cash to one of the world ’s biggest economies would re-energise the relationship with the former colony			0
however , @entity141 is a nuclear power , has its own space programme and is rich enough to donate money to poor @entity226 nations each year			1
@entity141 also : while the @entity227 axed aid to economic powerhouse economies such as @entity230 and @entity231 , @entity233 sources claim @entity141 is ‘ different ’			0
despite its immense poverty , @entity141 is home to some of the richest people on earth			0
the wealthiest @entity141 is @entity238 , chairman of @entity239 and the fourth richest man in the world			0
but perhaps the best known billionaire in @entity141 is @entity243 , the eccentric 55 - year - old owner of the @entity244 that produces @entity246 beer and is behind @entity247			1
he also owns a @entity249 team , and one of the world ’s biggest private yachts - the 312ft @entity141 empress			0
sceptics believe much of @entity13 ’s aid is as much about strengthening @entity13 trade ties as helping the poor			1
in a visit last year , @entity3 lobbied hard on behalf of @entity13 business			1
the trip led to a £ 686million aircraft deal for defence contractor @entity261 and engine makers @entity263			0
video : the prime minister was put on the spot during an @entity147 radio interview			1

the treatment she needs to beat *non-hodgkin* lymphoma is available in @entity272 but not in her area , she said
the 68 - year - old used the name @entity29 because some *members* of her family do *n't* even know she 's ill
she *accused* the @entity265 of sending money abroad that should be staying in @entity13
' we have a moral obligation to help people in other countries even when times are tough , ' he *replied* in tense @entity147 interview
