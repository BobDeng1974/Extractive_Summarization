@entity1 will invest £ 180million over the next ten years in defending the @entity2 against a ‘ very live ’ threat from @entity4 , defence secretary @entity0 said today			1
the announcement comes amid fears of an invasion after it emerged @entity8 could be helping to re-arm the @entity10 nation by leasing them 12 long - range bombers			2
mr @entity0 said @entity1 ’s military presence on the @entity15 territory would be ‘ beefed up ’ following the findings of a review by top brass			1
there are fears of an invasion of the @entity2 after it emerged @entity8 could be helping to re-arm the @entity10 nation by leasing them 12 long - range bombers but later he told @entity23 that there would be no more troops or fighter planes sent to the @entity1 territory after the review found @entity1 ’s military forces were at the ‘ level required ’ to ensure its protection against any threat			1
instead the @entity1 would ‘ modernise ’ its defences in the region by investing in some of the ‘ ageing infrastructure ’ , as a well as upgrading a surface - to - air missile system			2
his comments come amid claims there is a heightened risk of invasion by @entity4			2
mr @entity8 is understood to be working on a deal to lease 12 @entity43 long range bombers to the country			2
former defence minister sir @entity45 said the reported deal with @entity8 was ‘ very serious ’			1
he said : ‘ it is very serious indeed			0
@entity8 has many problems at home and yet he is ramping up tension in the @entity2			0
‘ our policy has been to deter @entity4 from repeating the folly of 1982			0
when you have a volatile political leadership , that is when things can get very dangerous			0
‘ the decision to invest £ 180million and continue with ground based air defences is welcome			0
’ the long - running dispute over the sovereignty of the @entity1 overseas territory has surfaced again in recent years under the presidency of @entity65			0
speaking before he addressed mps in the @entity67 , mr @entity0 told @entity68 ’s today programme : ‘ the threat remains			1
it is a very live threat			0
we have to respond to it			1
‘ we do need to modernise our defences to ensure that we have sufficient troops there and that the islanders have the right to remain @entity1 and the right to proper protection by our forces			0
‘ it is our general view that the threat has not reduced			0
’ however in the @entity67 he admitted that no more troops would be sent , nor would any more fighter jets be deployed after a review concluded current defence of the garrison was sufficient			1
he told mps : ‘ i have endorsed the assessment … that the current military presence is broadly proportionate to the threats and risks we face			1
‘ our forces in the @entity15 are entirely defensive , and are at a level required to ensure the defence of the @entity2 against any potential threat			1
‘ for the foreseeable future we will keep our numbers at around their current levels of about 1,200 personnel , military and civilian			2
’ @entity1 must build up its defence capabilities in response to the threat posed by @entity109 president @entity8			1
there are claims he is ramping up tensions in in the @entity2 , which have been heightened in recent years under the presidency of @entity65 a source said : ‘ i think the defence secretary meant to say “ modernising ” rather than “ beefing up ”			1
’ amid threats from @entity4 , mr @entity0 said the @entity118 would deploy two @entity120 helicopters which were used in @entity121 and which would replace the search and rescue @entity124 helicopters already in the region			1
the helicopters would enable the islands ’ garrison to mount a ‘ swift and decisive response ’ to ‘ any emerging incidents ’ , it was said			0

the @entity143 , @entity144 , would also remain in the region			0
‘ we should not drop our guard ’ , he told mps , insisting the @entity1 was ‘ not complacent ’ and the government would continue to remain ‘ vigilant ’			0
£ 180million would also be used to improve the quality of life of those in the @entity2 , including improving accommodation and a new primary school			0
a number of projects will be carried out to replace some of the ‘ ageing infrastructure ’ , including the refurbishment of @entity159 and the replacement of the existing power generation systems			0
a major modernisation of the fuels infrastructure is also underway , he said			0
but only four @entity166 jets are stationed there permanently and there are no plans to increase those numbers , mr @entity0 admitted			1
his comments to the @entity172 came after he told @entity173 : ‘ i ’m going to be announcing to @entity174 later today how we ’re going to beef up defences there , how we ’re going to modernise our defences			2
