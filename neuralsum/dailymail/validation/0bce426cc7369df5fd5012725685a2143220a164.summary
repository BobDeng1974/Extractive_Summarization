on sunday @entity0 will travel to @entity1 for their biggest match of their season			1
it will be a rip - roaring , full - bloodied battle which may well be settled by one moment of magic - an occasion made for those who shine on the biggest stages			0
and yet last year 's @entity14 man - of - the - match , a man who also played at the @entity12 in @entity13 , may well struggle to make @entity16 's starting line - up			1
@entity17 has had a difficult start to life in a @entity0 shirt since arriving from @entity21 @entity22 ( second right ) has suffered a @entity24 - eque loss of form that nobody saw coming based on ability , @entity17 should be a shoo - in			1
his explosive pace and unnerving eye for a killer pass would seem to be the perfect fit for a 90 minutes in which @entity0 may well spend long periods on the back foot , looking to counter			2
but the skills that made @entity36 write @entity21 a cheque for the best part of £ 60m have rarely been displayed after @entity22 suffered a @entity40 loss of form that nobody saw coming			1
the promise of an explosive partnership down the left with fellow new boy @entity47 had @entity0 fans drooling			2
@entity16 has stuck by his man so far , but he has a big decision to make ahead of sunday 's match @entity0 travel to @entity1 , and @entity22 may not be in the starting line - up at @entity53 @entity22 , however , did not want to leave @entity21 and that is where the problems began			1
mancunian winters , as @entity58 pointed out , can be hard to endure for those used to sunnier climes			0
six hours of grey light a day and continual rain can hammer at the mindset of those not used to it			0
@entity22 also struggled to adapt to @entity16 's tactical switches			1
he is not alone in that , and has rarely been given licence to roam up and down the left wing			0
the problems for @entity22 began when he left @entity21 - he was happy there and did not want to leave @entity22 was sent off in @entity0 's @entity74 clash with @entity75 earlier in march @entity76 pointed out that most players do not find their feet until their second season - but try telling that to @entity81 fans who have seen @entity79 fit seemlessly into @entity84 's @entity83 leaders			1
as if the above were enough to contend with , then came the break - in			0
sat at home in a foreign country watching tv with your wife and young daughter when suddenly a quiet night in is interrupted by the terrifying sound of raiders armed with scaffolding poles trying to smash their way into your isolated house			0
@entity100 started for @entity0 in @entity22 's absence against @entity102 and impressed throughout @entity76 now has to decide whether to stick or twist - @entity100 ( centre ) or @entity22 ( right ) on sunday ? yes , the thugs were disturbed by the alarm system and made their getaway			1
but the trauma of that experience must remain			0
there may have been , and may still be , recurring nightmares			0
in a state of panic , the @entity111 fled to a city centre hotel with a security team			0
the family now live high above the ground at a separate city centre apartment			0
it is safe and it is luxurious but it may well feel like a prison and is not the ideal environment in which to raise a young child			0
@entity76 , a family man , knows this			2
he has given @entity22 compassionate leave and stood by his man after the latest low , a red card for grabbing referee @entity130 's shirt in the @entity74 defeat to @entity75			2
@entity22 has shown flashes of his potential , scoring four goals in @entity0 colours since his arrival in august @entity22 ( right ) was all smiles on international duty in september , but his form has been poor for @entity0 in the subsequent victory over @entity102 , for which @entity22 was suspended , @entity0 delivered their best 45 minutes of the season			1
replacement @entity100 linked well with @entity142 as @entity76 's side displayed a synchronicity rarely seen this season			1
the @entity145 now has to decide whether to stick or twist			0
@entity100 , for all his qualities , lacks pace			2
@entity22 is a better player but can he finally deliver when @entity0 need him most ? with £ 60m already spent it is a gamble worth taking .			1

@entity0 travel to @entity1 for a huge game on sunday
@entity16 has to decide whether to start out - of - form @entity17
@entity22 has had a difficult start to life in @entity158 , particularly after *intruders* broke into his house while he and his family were there
based on ability , @entity22 should be in the starting xi , but @entity76 may decide to start @entity100 instead of the @entity165
