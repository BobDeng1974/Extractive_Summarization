anyone who has owned a cat knows that they most definitely like to feel in charge , and are quick to show their displeasure			0
so it is little wonder that these felines look decidedly unimpressed after their owners clipped and dyed them for a grooming competition			1
the world 's largest grooming competition , @entity13 , is held every year in @entity14 , @entity15 and features 2,000 of the world 's best pet groomers from 23 different countries			1
and they did n't disappoint this year with cats being made into lions , birds and dogs , amongst other things			1
the eccentric owners spend weeks meticulously spraying and clipping their cats to perfect their designs			1
cat named ' @entity49 ' has , in a slightly ironic twist , had beautiful patterns of three birds clipped and dyed into its fur ' martini ' the winning cat in the creative grooming category had an intricate floral design on its back , with diamond crystals stuck on for extra sparkle professional photographer @entity60 , 43 , who was at the event taking photos for his upcoming book , @entity63 , said : ' they are all professional groomers who take this one opportunity a year to really be creative			2
' most of the work is completed before they arrive at the show as they have to be meticulous and spend weeks dying and snipping their cats			1
' there is just so much detail and work involved as not one hair is out of place			0
' there was a cat who had been turned into a lion but he did n't manage to look very fierce			0
' there was also a cat that had been turned into @entity36 - which looked good			0
@entity80 is held by his doting owner who created the design , managing to scoop the top prize from 2,000 of the world 's best pet groomers @entity49 , here with his owner , is displayed inside a nest for maximum effect ' i 'm not a groomer myself and do n't have a cat or a dog , but i just love the effort that goes into these competitions			2
' i think the people involved have to be a little eccentric but in the nicest possible way			0
' there are some people who may think this is a cruel thing to do , but any cat owned by a professional groomer is going to be fantastically well looked after ' all of the dyes are non-toxic and the cats are obviously well looked after			2
' the competition was eventually won by @entity106 who had a beautiful multi-coloured design on his fur .			0
