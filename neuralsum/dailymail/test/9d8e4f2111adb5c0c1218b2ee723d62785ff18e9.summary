a woman who bought cheap hair extensions in a bid to look glamorous ended up with an infection and a hole in her head			1
@entity6 , from @entity7 , paid £ 100 for the weave but was forced to seek urgent medical attention after her scalp became infected			1
however , @entity6 , who spent the day of her 29th birthday in bandages , said the incident has not deterred her from hair hair extensions again			1
' that was the proposition when i met up with a friend who suddenly had the most amazing , long , flowing blonde hair			0
' she told me it ’s a weave and she got it done at an @entity38 hair shop			2
' i asked whether it was just for @entity41 hair but she said it was fine , adding that they would put my hair into cornrows and then sew the extensions in			2
@entity6 looks glamorous with her new glossy hair extensions a few weeks after having the weave , she developed painful boils ' i could n’t believe it when she told me the cheap price – it was £ 45 for a full head , while some salons charge hundreds , or even thousands			1
' having struggled to grow my own hair and often experimenting with clip - ins , i soon found myself getting it done too			0
' being able to go to bed with perfect hair and wake up with it was a revelation			0
people would always comment on how nice it looked and i was hooked			0
' miss @entity6 said that after the extensions had gone their course , instead of going back to the same place that she had them done before , she decided to save time and go somewhere closer to home			1
@entity6 spent her 29th birthday in bandages after her hair extension nightmare ( left and right ) ' the stylist at the salon in @entity73 , @entity7 , did not fill me with confidence , ' she said			1
' she was vague when discussing the price , and simply waved me to sit down so she could start there and then			0
i could see the needles sitting on the side in blue antiseptic liquid			0
' i did n’t have a great feeling about the place but i wanted them done for an event that night so i bit the bullet			2
' they ended up charging me £ 100 – way more than last time			1
' however , miss @entity6 said that a few weeks after having them put in , her scalp started to itch unbearably and she started to notice small lumps forming			1
' concerned , i took them out , but the lumps – one on top of my head and a cluster lower down towards my neck – seemed to grow and harden , ' she said			1
' the doctor said they were boils , which i ’d never had before , and said to bathe them			2
' instead of looking pretty on her 29th birthday , @entity6 spent the day in bandages after having the boils surgically removed miss @entity6 said that days later , pus began oozing from the one on top of her head , which although looked disgusting , seemed to ease it			1
' not so for the others though , ' she added			0
' they were fusing together and causing the area to swell			0
the pain was excruciating and i ’d stay up with my head in my hands , willing it to stop			2
' then , the night before my birthday , the lumps burst and thick red , lumpy liquid seeped out that burned as it touched the raw skin			1
' less than 24 hours later , i was lying on a hospital bed having a section of my head shaved			1
' fully awake and shaking with fear , i gritted my teeth as a doctor cut a hole into my skull to drain the infection			2
' despite having had nine needles injected into my head to try and numb the area , i could still feel it and the sound of scalpel on bone was like something from a horror movie			1
' i told the doctor to shave it all off , but thankfully it did n’t come to that			0
' i had to wear the bandage on my head for three weeks afterwards , making out - patient visits to have the hole in my head filled with a special material and the dressing replaced			2
looking good : @entity6 , pictured on the red carpet while covering the @entity143 , says despite her experiences , she has not been put off having hair extensions ' the medical opinion was that the cause had been a dirty needle used to sew the extensions in			1
my doctor said that it could have nicked my scalp as the hair was attached to the cornrows			0
' miss @entity6 said that when confronted , the salon owner was adamant it was the hair itself that was the cause , and as the customer had provided it , was not down to her			1
' shortly afterwards , the salon changed its name and has since closed down , ' added miss @entity6			1
' since then , i ’ve sporadically had similar abscesses develop on other parts of my body , including one which had to be cut out of my lower spine			0
it ’s horrid as aside from painful , they leave scars			0
' doctors as yet are unable to find a cause and keep advising me get tested for diabetes every few months			2
' research online shows that my case is not an isolated incident			0
' while one pointed the finger at extensions made from real human hair , i disagree as mine were synthetic			0
' despite her grim experience , miss @entity6 said the experience has not put her off			1
' call me crazy , but after leaving it a while , i gradually began to experiment with extensions again , ' she said			2
' it ’s a confidence thing i guess , especially when on a red carpet waiting to interview people who constantly have their hair coiffed to perfection			0
' i ’ve worn wigs in the past , but prefer extensions which give you so much more freedom			0
' ultimately , i think that the key is to just know who is doing your hair and if you get a bad feeling , no matter what the bargain , do n’t take the risk			0
it 's not worth it			0
