by @entity0 these road safety signs on a remote @entity3 mountain road have driven tourists to hysterics - and may have saved their lives			1
the signs on the @entity8 , a 298 - mile road with frequent plunging drops and landslide risks , include ' be gentle on my curves ' and ' if you want to donate blood , do n't do it on the road '			1
winding between the @entity19 and @entity21 regions in @entity22 , it gained traction with drivers by declaring ' speed thrills but often kills ' and ' driving faster can cause disaster '			2
poetry in motion : the signs are on a mountain pass between the @entity19 and @entity21 regions this is n't a car chase ! these signs have amused drivers on the 298 - mile @entity8 in @entity22 catchy : the signs were built by the @entity22 army to keep the road safe for the 18 weeks a year it is passable beautiful : but the road is a death trap , several thousand feet above sea level inducing altitude sickness simple message : @entity47 ( pictured ) , from @entity48 , has spent six years photographing the signs but the light - hearted tone of the signs belies their seriousness			1
the arid road is thought to be one of the most dangerous in the world and drivers have been killed after experiencing lapses in concentration caused by altitude sickness			1
@entity47 , 42 , has spent the last six years photographing the unusual road signs			1
he said : ' a few years ago i saw my first funny road sign			2

within an hour it was shared by more than 20 friends and liked by more than 100 people			0
' this inspired me to continue to photograph and share them			0
' blood bank : drivers on the road have reportedly blacked out after being overcome by altitude sickness live longer : the signs all convey a positive message - though they could of course be distracting themselves gently does it : mr @entity47 said his favourite sign after six years was ' drive like hell , you will be there ' the @entity19 - @entity86 highway is only open for 18 weeks during the summer , because snow makes the route impassable for the rest of the year			1
the comical road signs were erected by the @entity91 of the @entity92			1
mr @entity47 , from @entity48 , said his favourite sign reads , ' drive like hell , you will be there			0
' he said : ' i have many favourites , but i think that one has a strong message			2
' mr @entity47 , who documents the bizarre road signs on his website ladakhroadsigns.com , said he doubts the effectiveness of the messages			1
end of a relationship : one of the amusing - but deadly serious - signs photographed by @entity47 logic : it 's impossible to fault the simple thinking behind the signs , along a landslide - threatened blackspot driven to hysterics : the photos quickly gained traction on @entity68 and have been seen worldwide plane and simple : one of the witty signs reminds drivers that ' this is a highway , not a runway ' he said : ' i 'm not sure if they help with road safety			1

' on this quiet and very risky route , these signs bring smiles to drivers ' faces and help to ease their tension			0
' mr @entity47 said : ' most local truck drivers ca n't read @entity123			0
those who can just laugh at the humour ' poignant : the funny tone of the signs belies a serious message on one of the world 's most hazardous roads @entity152 : the @entity91 is famous for signs elsewhere , such as this one in @entity154 , @entity3			1
