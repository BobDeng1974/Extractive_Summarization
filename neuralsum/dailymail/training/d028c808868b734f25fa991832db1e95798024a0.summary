by @entity0 published : 08:36 est , 9 july 2013 updated : 09:39 est , 9 july 2013 @entity1 was today denied compensation for the eight years he spent in prison after being wrongly convicted of the murder of tv presenter @entity5			1
he claimed to be the victim of a ' miscarriage of justice ' - but judges agreed with a minister that mr @entity1 was ' not innocent enough ' to be eligible for a pay - off			1
the decision at the @entity13 followed the dismissal of his compensation claim by two @entity17 judges in january who said he had ' failed the legal test ' to claim a pay - off			1
@entity31 , sitting at the @entity13 in @entity30 , today rejected an application by mr @entity1 for permission to challenge the january decision and said the 53 - year - old had ' no realistic prospects ' of success			1
mr @entity1 was seeking a fresh examination of his case which could allow him to claim up to Â£ 500,000 from the @entity40 for lost earnings and wrongful imprisonment			1
miss @entity5 , the presenter of @entity43 , was shot dead outside her home in @entity45 , @entity30 , in april 1999			0
mr @entity1 was convicted of murdering her in 2001 , but was acquitted after a retrial in 2008			2
victim : miss @entity5 's real killer has never been identified after mr @entity1 was acquitted of murder in 2008 @entity1 has been seeking compensation from the @entity40 ever since he was acquitted of @entity5 's murder in august 2008			1
his initial claim was rejected in january 2010 , but he launched a challenge to that decision based on a landmark @entity56 ruling granting @entity58 compensation for the 14 years he spent in jail after being wrongfully convicted of murder			1
that case hinged on @entity62 of the @entity63 1988 , which says that victims of a ' miscarriage of justice ' should be compensated by the @entity40			0
however , justice secretary @entity67 told mr @entity1 that his case did not qualify , because he was ' not innocent enough to be compensated '			2
in january this year , two @entity17 judges agreed with mr @entity67 , denying him compensation because his conviction was not so unfair as to count as a miscarriage of justice			2
mr @entity1 's lawyer had argued that ' no reasonable jury , properly directed , could have convicted on the evidence that was available to them ' , but the @entity17 judges concluded that this was incorrect and that a jury could reasonably have found him guilty			1
the decision at the @entity81 today means that mr @entity1 can not challenge the @entity17 's decision any longer			2
after today 's ruling , his sister @entity83 said outside the @entity85 that the @entity13 judge 's decision was a ' travesty of justice '			2
with her brother standing by her side , she told reporters : ' there never was any viable evidence against @entity1			0
' this whole case from april 2000 until today has been a smoke and mirrors exercise designed to placate a worried public , and give the impression that justice had been done			0
' well neither the @entity5 family , nor our family , has seen any justice in the past 13 years			0
' she added : ' serving eight years in prison for someone else 's crime is not acceptable			0
' everything was taken from this man when the police started what we believe to be a malicious prosecution			0
he lost his home , his furniture , his clothing and all of his possessions , his place within his community and his church family			0
' ms @entity83 said the family would prepare to ' stand against this latest travesty of justice '			0
she concluded : ' @entity1 is innocent			0
he deserves a financial settlement to compensate for all that was taken from him - everything he owned and eight years of his life			0
' during today 's hearing @entity128 , representing mr @entity1 free of charge , submitted that the prosecution case against him was ' not viable and not a case where a reasonable jury could have convicted '			1
in arguing for permission to appeal , mr @entity134 said : ' we seek an opportunity to make out our argument to the secretary of state that no reasonable jury , properly directed , could have convicted on the evidence that was available to them at the retrial '			0
but the @entity17 judges concluded : ' there was indeed a case upon which a reasonable jury , properly directed , could have convicted the claimant of murder			1
' scene of the crime : miss @entity5 was gunned down outside her home in @entity45 , pictured mr @entity1 's initial claim for compensation for lost earnings and wrongful imprisonment was rejected in january 2010			2
his legal challenge against that decision was put on hold until after a panel of nine @entity56 justices gave their ruling in the case of @entity58 - a former aircraft engineer who spent 14 years in jail before his murder conviction was ruled unsafe			1
after the @entity58 ruling , mr @entity1 was told by the justice secretary in june 2011 that he was still not entitled to compensation under @entity169 of the @entity170			2
in january the @entity17 judges rejected mr @entity1 's challenge along with three others , but they found in favour of @entity174 , who spent eight years behind bars for murder before being freed by the @entity13 in 2009			1
mr @entity174 was jailed for life in 2002 after confessing to the murder of retired sea captain @entity179 on the @entity181 estate in @entity182 , @entity183			0
the judges ruled that in his case the decision to refuse compensation was legally flawed and must be reconsidered in the light of their ruling			1
in mr @entity1 's case the two @entity17 judges said : ' there was indeed a case upon which a reasonable jury , properly directed , could have convicted the claimant of murder			1
' permission to appeal has previously been granted in the three other cases dismissed by the @entity17 and a hearing at the @entity13 relating to those is expected in october .			0

@entity1 spent eight years in prison after being convicted of murder
sought compensation for his *mistreatment* but judges turned him down
today the @entity13 ruled that his case was not clear - cut enough to require a state pay - off
