@entity0 is being urged by @entity1 to make a return to frontline politics and take on @entity5 's next first minister @entity4			1
senior members of @entity8 's inner circle are increasingly alarmed at the performance of ' unimpressive ' @entity5 leader @entity10 and believe mr @entity0 could write a ' new ending for his political career ' in @entity13			1
he could become ' the father of the nation ' , one insider suggested			0
as nominations for the job of @entity19 leader closed , it was confirmed that no @entity32 politician had been brave enough to challenge @entity21 , who will now enjoy an official coronation next month			1
in a move critics immediately branded ' unstatesmanlike ' , the leader - elect announced she will embark on a nationwide tour to speak to @entity19 supporters in the coming days - including an event at @entity40 's @entity39			1
she also risked infuriating the majority of @entity5 who voted @entity43 in last month 's referendum by claiming that @entity5 will become independent ' well ' within her lifetime			2
prime minister @entity47 yesterday wrote to @entity21 to congratulate her and said he looked forward to working with her			0
the three main parties at @entity13 will now be led by women but there are ongoing rumours about miss @entity54 's future			0
although @entity5 strongly backed the @entity64 in last month 's referendum , the @entity57 campaign 's triumph in @entity59 's heartlands of @entity40 , @entity60 and @entity61 - including in miss @entity54 's own seat of @entity63 - has alarmed the @entity66 party			1
but mr @entity0 is credited with revitalising the no campaign and made the most impressive speech of the referendum campaign on the eve of the poll			0
denbeath mp hinted during the referendum campaign that he could stand for the @entity5 parliament , although he has since played down the prospects of a return			1
but a @entity80 source said : ' everyone has come back from @entity5 shocked by how bad things are in the party there			2
@entity10 is deeply unimpressive - she has got to go			1
' my worry is that @entity4 could be an even tougher opponent than @entity86 was			2
she has more appeal to women and we are going to find ourselves in real trouble unless we respond			0
' miss @entity4 made history yesterday after being lined up as the next first minister - making her the first woman to reach the top of @entity5 politics the @entity19 angrily rejected comparisons between @entity4 and @entity97 nationalist mps reacted furiously yesterday after @entity5 office minister @entity99 congratulated @entity4 on ' emulating ' @entity97			1
mr @entity99 , @entity5 's only @entity100 mp , cheekily told the @entity66 leader @entity101 : ' i join the honourable gentleman in congratulating @entity4 on emulating @entity97 and becoming the first female leader of her party			1
' i most certainly look forward to working with her as the first female first minister of scotland			0
my previous experience of @entity4 is that she has adopted a constructive approach to discussions with the @entity111			2
' but , speaking in the @entity112 yesterday , mr @entity101 replied : ' there is absolutely no comparison between @entity4 and @entity97			1
' @entity4 will be leading the most popular political party in @entity5			1
' @entity97 destroyed the @entity100 party , and he [ mr @entity99 ] is the living proof of its having only one seat in @entity5			1
' another senior @entity59 source said : ' @entity0 could go to the @entity5 parliament for four or five years and become the father of the nation , like @entity124 was			1
we need he is still hugely popular in @entity5			2
the @entity19 are running rings round @entity10			1
' one @entity5 mp said : ' there is real concern that we do n't have leadership in @entity5			2
it would delight many if @entity0 would take control			0
' the @entity133 understands there was a ' gloomy ' private meeting of @entity136 in the @entity112 on tuesday evening , in which the fall - out from last month 's referendum was discussed			0
@entity140 education secretary @entity139 yesterday said there had been a ' fracture in the @entity143 ' in @entity5 , which the party now needs to move quickly to heal			2
one insider said the party was ' fearful ' of a ' drubbing ' by the @entity19 at next year 's general election , which could force miss @entity54 to stand down			0
by then , 44 - year - old @entity21 will be @entity5 's fifth first minister after replacing her ' mentor ' @entity86 , who resigned after last month 's humiliating referendum defeat			1
miss @entity4 joined the @entity19 at the age of 16 and stood - unsuccessfully - to be an mp when she was 21			1
she stood for the party 's leadership in 2004 but was heading for defeat in the battle against @entity156 , prompting mr @entity86 to come back on a ' dream ticket ' with @entity21 as his deputy			0
she has been deputy first minister since the @entity19 's first election victory in 2007 , also holding the role of health secretary until put in charge of the referendum fight			2
' it is a privilege to have been chosen by the @entity19 to succeed @entity86 as party leader , ' she said yesterday			2
' @entity86 is a hard act to follow but i am determined to lead the @entity19 - and the country - from strength to strength			0
' i will work to ensure that the @entity5 parliament gets the extensive new powers that @entity5 was promised before the referendum			0
' i will always make the case for @entity5 to be an independent country , but with the @entity66 parties already backsliding on the delivery of new powers , my immediate job will be to hold them firmly to account - and i am today putting them on notice that i intend to do just that			0
' speaking to the @entity187 channel , she said : ' i believe @entity5 will become an independent country			0
i believe that 's the direction of travel			0
' pressed when that would happen , she replied : ' i believe that would be well within my lifetime			0
' on the rise of women to lead @entity5 's political parties , @entity21 said : ' it is significant - it sends a very powerful message ... [ but ] i do n't think we should assume it 's job done on gender balance			0
