' women who have suffered postpartum psychosis after their first pregnancy have an even chance of developing it again after following pregnancies , so there are risk factors to consider if i want to have more children in the future			1
' what i went through was terrible and even though it 's rare it can happen to anyone			0
' but when people ask me about it , i do n't shy away from it			0
it 's important that all aspects of mental health are discussed openly and honestly in order for people to understand it better			0
