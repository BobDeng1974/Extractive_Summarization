@entity1 ’s attempts to replace @entity2 as manager have hit a stumbling block after talks with @entity6 slowed down in the past 24 hours			1
the relationship between @entity8 and chairman @entity9 has broken down over transfer policy and what the manager perceives to be a series of false promises emanating from the boardroom			1
@entity15 is livid that after six successive defeats to start the campaign , @entity8 returned to his native @entity18 last week - @entity20 understands the @entity18 was on a scheduled family break that had been agreed with the club - rather than focus on improving the fitness of a squad which played just two pre-season games over the summer			1
in the frame : @entity6 looked poised to take the reins at @entity1 the chairman decided to bring an end to @entity8 ’s reign this weekend but the @entity18 was not informed over the club ’s intentions and took training on monday and tuesday after returning to @entity34			1
@entity6 , who is understood to have previously rejected the @entity1 job twice before , was in line to take the job			1
however , it is believed that an agent has become involved in the deal and a source close to the club has indicated that @entity9 , who traditionally refuses to pay representatives , has now become unhappy			2
@entity6 , for his part , is believed to have concerns over the working conditions of a club that is in utter disarray			2
it is thought that he and his assistants have been warned about the situation at the club by previous employees of @entity15			0
under pressure : @entity2 has been criticised for heading back to @entity18 during the international break the deal with @entity6 is not dead in the water and could yet be revived as the loveless marriage with @entity8 appears unsustainable			1
in an interview with the @entity60 on tuesday , @entity9 remained coy on whether @entity8 would be shown the exit door , but the chairman did stress his fury at the manager 's actions over the past week			1
' until i 've spoken to @entity2 personally , i do n't want to comment about the speculation or go into it in too much detail , ' said @entity9			2
' however , i have to say i find myself slightly bemused yet again by the actions of our manager			0
' he has said , on many occasions on the record , that he would use the international break to get the players up to fitness and to work with the squad we now have			2
the first thing the manager does is hop on a plane and clear off to @entity18 for a week without telling anyone			0
' let 's face it , we 've lost every competitive game he 's managed and these actions are n't the most professional way to get us out of this position			0
to hop on a plane without telling your employer or your colleagues is n't right			0
it 's something i will be speaking to him about			0
' it is likely that @entity15 will have to come to a financial settlement with the manager if he wants him to leave			0
@entity102 ’s @entity101 is an alternative if @entity6 can not be secured .			0
