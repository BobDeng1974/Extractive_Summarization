by @entity0 last updated at 2:52 am on 26th november 2011 with plenty of sunshine , blue skies and mild temperatures , winter seems a world away			2
but rewind 12 months and the picture was about as different as it could be with early snow and freezing conditions			2
this time last year , @entity10 was having fun sledging in her garden and building a snowman in @entity15 in @entity16			1
but this year the five - year - old is watering the geraniums and relaxing in the unusually warm weather that has been with us for weeks			1
and on the @entity24 moors , regulars at the @entity21 in @entity22 are enjoying @entity26 cocktails in sharp contrast to last year when they faced the ‘ ultimate lock - in ’ after the pub became buried under 16ft of snow			1
what a difference a year makes : @entity32 , 5 , sits in the garden in @entity15 , @entity16 , watering the geraniums today , right			2
a year ago she was out on her sledge white out : @entity36 , head chef at the @entity21 , digging his way through deep snow near @entity39 a year ago today one year to the day when the big freeze started : the @entity21 's @entity36 raises a cocktail to the warmer weather one year on : walkers dress up in hats and coats - but there is no snow in sight at the @entity21 two guests and five workers were stranded by snowdrifts which covered the road and buried cars outside , cutting off any escape from the 16th - century freehouse , which , at an elevation of 1,325ft ( 404m ) , advertises itself as the country 's fourth - highest pub. co-owner @entity59 had to put a warning on the @entity21 's website urging customers not to attempt to reach the pub. he said : ' this year it 's a very different story			1
' we 're pretty high up and pretty exposed up here but the snow still caught us a little by surprise last year			1
' it all seemed to fall within the space of one evening 's shift - then the drifts really cut us off			2
' we were stuck until about december 6 , when we still had plenty of food and drink left but had just about run out of @entity76 gas for the heating			0
' it was fun at first but i prefer this			0
there 's only so much painting and decorating and cleaning you can do			0
' i 'd rather be out here with a cocktail than breaking my back with a snow shovel in my hands			2
' winter wonderland : walkers in @entity39 on the @entity93 on this day last year @entity94 autumn day : a year later it is unseasonally mild - and a lot greener in the @entity93 today : scattered showers expected this afternoon - and it will be cold across the north			1
some snow expected in @entity100 on high ground			0
there will be constant heavy rain from midnight tonight , spreading from the west of the country			0
saturday : it will be cold and windy in the north although in the south and central areas it should remain largely dry			0
sunday : windy in the north on sunday with early rain across @entity113 and @entity114 clearing eastwards to leave it dry with sunny spells and isolated showers			0
there will be showers in north - west @entity100 , these wintry over the hills			0
early showers in @entity123 will die out to leave it mostly dry with sunny spells			0
now weathermen have put their necks on the line and told us there will be no repeat of last year 's big freeze - so it might just be the time to stock up on winter woollies , gloves and scarves			1
just days before the beginning of december it is more sultry in @entity140 than in @entity141			0
the weather has been so unseasonably mild that @entity144 forecasters say @entity145 is on course for its warmest ever november , and december wo n't be much different			1
much of the country has enjoyed unusually warm weather in recent weeks , with the temperatures hitting 18c ( 64.4f ) in parts of the @entity145			1
many people have yet to reach for the gloves , scarves and thermal vests , and it could be a while before they have to do so			0
the @entity144 says figures for the month so far reveal the average @entity145 temperature has been 9.4c ( 48.9f ) – the november average is 5.9c ( 42.6f )			1
the mean temperature in the @entity160 and @entity161 – traditionally one of the @entity145 ’s warmest regions – has been a balmy 11.2c ( 52f ) , which is 4.5c above the usual average			1
the average temperature for @entity166 is 11.8 , 4.3 degrees warmer than normal			0
the @entity144 says the unusual weather is caused by warm air blown up from southern @entity169			1
it is also drier than normal			0
average rainfall in the first two weeks of november was 25mm , less than half of what would usually have fallen			1
@entity145 weather outlook for today and tomorrow - it is set to remain unseasonably warm but will be wet in the north almost like a summer 's day : feeding the ducks at @entity180 's @entity179 lake in @entity181 warming to the theme : a grey squirrel sits in fallen leaves in @entity185 in @entity180 @entity100 had just 10.9mm of rain during the first two weeks of the month - just one twentieth ( six per cent ) of the long term average			1
@entity189 , of the @entity144 , said : ‘ the warmest november ever recorded in the @entity145 was in 1994 , when the average mean temperature was 8.8c ( 47.8 )			1
' it ’s too early to say whether it ’s going to be above that , but it looks like it could be one of the warmest			0
’ she said the weather this weekend would be ‘ unsettled ’ for much of @entity145 but that temperatures would remain unusually high			0
they could top 13c ( 55.4f ) in @entity140 – double the november average and warmer than @entity201 in @entity141 , where the mercury is not expected to rise above 11c ( 51.8f ) this weekend			2
and while november has been warm			2
that is set to continue into december as a repeat of last year 's extreme weather looks increasingly unlikely			2
picnic in the park : it has been shorts weather for part of november , with this group enjoying the sun in @entity180 's @entity181 stunning display : the autumn hues of leaves stand out as the @entity145 continues to experience unseasonably mild weather @entity144 forecaster @entity216 said : ' there ’s no signal for a repeat of last year 's december cold spell			1
' last december saw a very prolonged period with wave after wave of cold spells and snow , ice and sub-zero temperatures			0
' but rather than that , it looks like we 're in for a mixed , unsettled december this year , with some cold spells but also milder spells			0
' @entity233 and the @entity234 in the heavy snow that brought parts of @entity180 to a standstill in the build up to @entity239 last year last year 's @entity241 conditions forced flights to be cancelled and made for treacherous driving even on motorways			2

pub in @entity24 buried in 16ft of snow this time last year is now serving @entity26 cocktails
unusual weather caused by warm air blown up from southern @entity169
average rainfall in the first two weeks of november was 25mm - less than half than is usual
