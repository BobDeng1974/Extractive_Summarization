prehistoric humans had teeth that were much stronger than their modern counterparts and were more like those of sea otters , which are capable of cracking open shellfish with their jaws			1
a new study of the structure of tooth enamel has found that our early human ancestors had teeth that were surprisingly similar to those of the marine mammal			1
researchers at the @entity17 in @entity18 , @entity19 , and @entity20 , found that teeth with this structure are capable of withstanding huge bite forces			1
sea otters ' teeth are so strong they are capable of cracking open shell fish like clams , as seen above this suggests that our prehistoric ancestors jaws were far more powerful than our own , perhaps allowing them to crack open nuts and bones to get to the marrow inside			1
the news could help anthropologists build up a more accurate picture of what our ancestors may have looked like			0
an ancient relative of humans dubbed ' @entity40 ' because of his powerful jaws and huge teeth may have actually preferred to eat grass , according to a recent study			2
@entity45 lived in @entity46 more than one million years ago and lived side - by - side with direct ancestors of humans			1
it has long been assumed that this species lived on a diet of nuts , seeds and hard fruit because of its powerful jaw muscles and the biggest and flattest molars of any known hominid in the anthropological record			0
however , professor @entity59 of the @entity60 said studies of the wear marks on the teeth from @entity45 suggest it was eating soft fruit and grasses			2
he also found that carbon isotopes embedded in fossil teeth indicated that the @entity70 man may have lived on large amounts of grasses and sedges			2
he said : ' frankly , we did n't expect to find the primate equivalent of a cow dangling from a remote twig of our family tree			0
' the new study , which is published in the @entity81 journal @entity82 , found that sea otter tooth enamel had high numbers of curved bands of crystals - 19 per millimetre			1
this was found to be comparable to the number seen in large flat teeth of the hominin known as @entity45 that lived in @entity46 more than million years ago			1
fossilised teeth from prehistoric @entity92 found in @entity46 are also known to have 16 of these bands per millimetre			2
modern humans , however , have just 14 bands per millimetre			2
this banding of crystals in tooth enamel is sometimes known as decussation			0
when the researchers conducted tests on the otter 's teeth , they found that they were able to withstand nearly three times as much pressure before chipping than modern human teeth			1
similar chips have been found in fossilised teeth of human ancestors			1
dr @entity111 , a research fellow who led the study at the @entity113 and @entity114 , said : ' @entity116 enamel is much tougher than that of humans			0
' some sectional images of fossil hominin teeth show greater decussation than in modern humans			1
' estimates of 16 bands per millimetre in @entity126 early homo sapiens and 19 bands per millimetre in @entity45 fossils are strikingly similar to sea otter data			1
' the explanation may be dietary — to avoid teeth being chipped during hard object feeding involving high bite forces			0
' the bands of crystals in the enamal of sea otter teeth ( above ) were similar to those in fossilised humans the broad flat teeth of @entity45 , seen above in this fossilised skull , have led some anthropologists to nickname the early human ' nutcracker man ' as they believe it lived on a diet of hard nuts and fruits sea otters ' teeth ( left ) were found to have similar structures to those of early fossils of homo sapiens ( right ) fossilised remains of early hominins like @entity45 have led anthropologists to conclude that they lived on a diet of hard nuts , seeds and fruits			1
they have some of the largest and flattest molars of any hominin fossil found to date and their teeth are covered in a thick layer of enamel			0
however , a study in 2011 claimed that these large teeth were perhaps used by @entity45 to eat grass much like a cow			0
the latest findings , however , suggest these ancient humans had a formidable bite force and suggests that they tackled food somewhat tougher than grass			2
sea otters , for example , use their powerful teeth , which the researchers found could resist chipping at an average pressure of @entity182 per half metre			2
human teeth are able to resist chipping at an average of just 1,000 @entity185 per half metre			0
dr @entity111 said : ' using toughness estimates for modern human enamel , the sizes of some ante - mortem chips in fossil hominin enamel suggest kilonewton forces			0
' if the toughness of sea otter enamel were assumed for robust hominins like @entity45 , then this would predict exceptionally high critical tooth fracture loads			1
' sea otters eat hard - shelled clams , mussels and crabs , often cracking them open while floating on their backs dr @entity203 , an anthropologist at @entity204 , said the new study opens up some interesting questions about what lead to the extinction of @entity45			0
he said : ' the genus @entity210 have always been an odd group of hominins			0
' they lived alongside the @entity214 and members of our own genus , @entity218 , from around 2.5 to 1 million years ago			1
' their massive jaws and huge teeth suggest that they evolved to eat some incredibly hard foodstuffs and to exploit the same sort of habitat as prehistoric @entity126 pigs			0
' their extinction has long been blamed on an inability to out compete the pigs but this study suggests that the teeth of @entity210 were capable of chewing up even harder food stuffs than previously thought - perhaps even bone			0
' it seems that while our direct ancestors such as @entity237 were using cultural adaptations like stone tools the @entity234 had evolved a biological tool kit in the form of massive teeth capable of chewing ineradicable hard material in an ultimately doomed bid to compete against nature ’s supreme waste disposal machine - the pig			0

researchers in @entity19 and the @entity250 studied the structure of tooth enamal
they found the crystal structure of sea otter teeth is similar human fossils
@entity116 teeth are almost three times as tough as those in modern humans
findings suggest prehistoric humans like @entity45 that lived one million years ago had a far more powerful bite than modern humans
it may help anthropologists work out what human ancestors once ate
