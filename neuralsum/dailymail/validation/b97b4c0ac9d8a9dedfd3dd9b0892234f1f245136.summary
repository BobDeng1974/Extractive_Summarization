the same jury that decides guilt will decide whether he receives life in prison or the death penalty			1

it had been expected to last three to four months but is moving faster than anticipated , largely because the defense has not cross-examined many witnesses .			0

three police officers testified about the *harrowing* gun battle in @entity1 , @entity92 during @entity9 's trial on monday
before their testimony , jurors visited the bullet - riddled vessel where he was found hiding after the shootout

@entity9 , now 21 , is on trial for the bombings that killed three and injured more than 260 , but his attorneys say he was recruited by his brother
if convicted , the same jury will decide if he should get the death penalty
