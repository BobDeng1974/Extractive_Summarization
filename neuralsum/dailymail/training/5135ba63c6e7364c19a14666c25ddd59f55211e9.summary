by @entity0 published : 09:06 est , 9 october 2012 updated : 09:06 est , 9 october 2012 a civil rights group has devised a new kind of online test that measures a user 's sense of human empathy to distinguish them from automatic spam posting programmes			1
the @entity9 asks users to take a moral stance on a real - world civil rights issue by offering them three options about how they feel about it			1
only one answer is correct , and that is the one which shows compassion and empathy			1
moral stance : a new kind of @entity23 asks users to prove they are human by choosing the morally correct response from a choice of three for example , the @entity23 might ask a user : ' in @entity30 people are tortured in detention			2
how does that make you feel ? ' it then asks them to enter either ' excited ' , or ' bothered ' , or ' great '			2
a captcha is a type of challenge - response test used in computing as an attempt to ensure that the response is generated by a person			0
the acronym , coined in 2000 by researchers from @entity45 , is based on the word ' capture ' and stands for ' completely automated public turing test to tell computers and humans apart '			0
a common type of @entity23 requires the user to type letters or digits from a distorted image that appears on the screen , and the tests are commonly used to prevent unwanted internet bots from accessing websites			0
are you human ? the test was designed by @entity62 campaign group @entity61 and draws from examples of incidents that breach the @entity65 devised by campaign group @entity61 , an @entity62 campaign group , the @entity9 is intended to raise the profile of civil rights struggles worldwide			1
' with over 200 million captchas being solved everyday , we hope that by catching a tiny amount of those interactions we can help promote and empower our partners - brave human rights defenders , who often put themselves at great risk through their engagement for other people 's rights , ' they say			0
most of the situations presented by the @entity9 are based on real events where the @entity65 has been breached			1
@entity61 add that there is no content related to their work on the app that is based on their ' subjective and personal ' values			0
the app is available as free code for any web developer to use on their site .			0

examples drawn from breaches of @entity65
users must choose the one answer out of three that shows compassion and empathy
