by @entity0 published : 09:52 est , 11 january 2013 updated : 09:52 est , 11 january 2013 we 've all been there : the annoying moment when your @entity4 goes off and you 're busy doing something else			0
you stop what you 're doing , reach into your pocket or bag , and by the time you 've pulled out the phone , you 're too late to draw your finger across the screen and answer the dratted thing			2
well , if you thought you were annoyed by missed calls , you obviously were n't as annoyed as this @entity16 man			1
obviously inspired by the quick - draw technique of gunslinging cowboys in @entity29 movies , the young man has designed a holster for the @entity4 that can , apparently , be strapped to the limb of your choice			1
the @entity35 clip shows a detailed drawing of the holster , which seems to be an @entity4 holder attached to an extending plastic arm that you strap to your arm or leg			1
when the phone rings , you flick your wrist and the arm shoots out , bringing your phone to your ear in a second			2
when the phone is not in use , it remains hidden up your sleeve			0
on the clip , the man demonstrates in agonising detail how the quick draw holster works			1
how it works : a drawing shows the design of the @entity4 gadget @entity61 - moshi ? the inventor answers his phone within seconds gunslinger : the man appears to have modelled his design - and technique - on quick - draw cowboys in @entity29 shoots from the sleeve : the @entity4 is always close to hand in a variety of increasingly bizarre locations ( sitting on a loo , leaping backwards onto his bed , lying beside a toy train track on a building 's roof ) , the inventor shows how the @entity4 can be at his ear almost immediately it rings			1
he looks extremely pleased with himself as he stares into the camera			0
his invention does not always work perfectly , though , with the @entity4 flying out of its holder and across the room on a couple of occasions			0
you can wear it on your leg ... or on both legs , should the mood take you why he felt the need to test his gadget on top of a tall building while lying next to a train - set is anyone 's guess , but it has n't harmed the ratings , which were pushing 1,000,000 this morning , two days after the clip was posted on @entity35			1
most of the comments posted by viewers were positive , but not everyone was so impressed			0
one person wrote : ' someone needs a girlfriend			0
' the inventor does a commando - style roll out of his apartment to demonstrate the holster 's versatility motive not entirely clear : the inventor shows how he can answer his iphone on top of a rain - soaked office block off the rails : the innovator shows how he wo n't even miss a call when playing with a trainset video : watch the hilarious footage showing how to answer your @entity4 like a cowboy			2
