by @entity0 published : 20:25 est , 29 may 2012 updated : 20:25 est , 29 may 2012 abortion clinics have been accused of offering pregnant women the option to terminate based on the sex of their baby , according to pro-life campaigners			2
the organization @entity8 sent a pregnant woman into a @entity11 clinic with a hidden camera			1
during her appointment , she made it clear to the counselor that she will only have a termination if the child is female but would keep a baby boy			1
the health adviser supports her decision and even explains how to access @entity21 in order to have an ultrasound to determine the sex of the baby before scheduling an abortion around five months into the pregnancy			2
@entity11 has condemned @entity8 's investigation as a ' hoax ' and said the counselor no longer works at the center in south @entity31 , @entity32			1
in the video , the pregnant woman enters the clinic for an appointment to schedule her abortion			1
the woman tells the counselor ' @entity35 ' that she is in her first trimester and therefore can not be certain of her baby 's gender			1
reading medical notes , @entity35 said : ' i see that you ’re saying that you want to terminate if it ’s a girl , so are you just wanting to continue the pregnancy in the meantime ? ' the abortion covers you up until 23 weeks and usually at 5 months is when they detect , you know , whether or not it ’s a boy or a girl			1
' the @entity11 counselor then advises the woman , sitting off - camera , that she could get on @entity69 in order to pay for an ultrasound to determine the gender of her baby and use the knowledge for an elective abortion			1
choices : @entity11 in south @entity31 , @entity32 was where pro-life organization @entity8 staged their undercover sting conflicting : @entity79 ( pictured left ) set up the pro-life group @entity8 when she was 15			1
her undercover sting of a @entity11 clinic was condemned as a hoax by vp of the non-profit @entity85 ( right ) she finally suggests the woman ' just continue and try again ' for a boy if she has to abort a girl and shows her to the door with the words : ' good luck , and i hope that you do get your boy			1
' founder and president of @entity8 @entity79 said in a statement to @entity98 : ' the search - and - destroy targeting of baby girls through prenatal testing and abortion is a pandemic that is spreading across the globe			1
' research proves that sex - selective abortion has now come to @entity42			2
the abortion industry , led by @entity11 , is a willing participant			1
' @entity8 is youth - based movement that was started in 2003 by ms @entity79 , then 15 years old			1
it is a pro-life organization and describes abortion as the ' greatest human rights injustice of our time '			2
decision time : the counselor helps the pregnant woman prepare @entity69 paperwork to have an ultrasound to determine the sex of her baby before she decides whether or not to have a termination its undercover investigation was used as a tactic for revealing practices at abortion clinics			1
@entity128 is set to debate the @entity129 ( @entity130 ) tomorrow which would ban sex - selective abortions across the @entity42 at present , only @entity132 , @entity133 , @entity134 and @entity135 prohibit the practice			2
the bill would ban abortions performed because of a baby 's gender			0
if it became law , it would mean that medical staff who suspect a woman is seeking an abortion based on the sex of her baby would have to report her to authorities			2
it would also leave doctors who performed the abortions at risk of being sent to prison or lawsuits			0
several health directors have raised concerns that such a law would put minority women at risk , in particular @entity159 - @entity42 women			0
the issue of sex selection in @entity159 countries was highlighted in a report by the @entity164 last year			0
@entity165 , executive director of the @entity166 , said : ' no woman should ever be scrutinized or interrogated by her doctor , but this is exactly what would happen if this bill becomes law			2
' @entity11 is a non-profit which has lobbied for pro-choice for more than 90 years			1
in its mission statement , its aim ' to empower individuals to make independent , informed decisions about their sexual and reproductive lives '			0
following what @entity11 described as a ' hoax ' campaign , vice president of education @entity85 released a statement			1
she said : ' six weeks ago a former staff member serving in an entry - level position did not follow our protocol for providing information and guidance when presented with a highly unusual patient scenario			0
' within three days of this patient interaction , the staff member ’s employment was ended and all staff members at this affiliate were immediately scheduled for retraining in managing unusual patient encounters			0
ms @entity85 continued : ' today opponents of @entity11 are promoting an edited video of that hoax patient encounter			1
' gender bias is contrary to everything our organization works for daily in communities across the country			0
' the world ’s leading women ’s health and rights organizations , including the @entity164 , do not believe that curtailing access to abortion services is a legitimate means of addressing sex selection , and have made clear that gender bias can only be resolved by addressing the underlying conditions that lead to it			0
' the risk of death is higher the later a woman decides to have an abortion			2
there is one fatality per 6,000 abortions at 21 weeks and more			0
in a press release , @entity8 also said that six studies since 2008 have revealed that there are thousands of ' missing girls ' in the @entity42 after sex - selective abortion			2
the @entity164 reported that the biologically normal sex ratio at birth rangesfrom 102 to 106 males per 100 females			0
there has been cause for concern in some countries - including @entity237 and @entity238 - where this ratio has climbed to 130			0
many @entity159 societies place the family 's economic security and future lineage on the heads of sons rather than daughters			0
it has resulted in pressure , blatant or subtle , on women to produce sons			0
there have been numerous initiatives by governments to try to address the issue			0
several countries have passed laws against sex - selective abortions and the issue is due to be debated in the @entity42 tomorrow as @entity128 addresses the @entity129			0
who reported last year that some countries have introduced direct measures such as scholarship programs for girls or pensions for families which only have girls in an effort to redress the gender bias .			0
