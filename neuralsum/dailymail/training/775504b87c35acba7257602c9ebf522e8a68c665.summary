by @entity0 @entity1 savoured his return to the big stage with @entity4 in the @entity6 final but admitted : ' if we 'd won it would have been a hundred times better			1
' the former @entity11 captain was expected to be little more than a big name cheerleader on saturday at @entity13 , having played just two matches since coming out of retirement this summer , but he was thrust into the spotlight after @entity17 was injured in the semi-final win over @entity19			1
it led to an emotional evening for @entity1 , as the 36 - year - old dismissed @entity23 batsman @entity22 with his first delivery and went desperately close to winning the match with the bat , striking a pair of back - to - back sixes off @entity29 at the end of the 19th over			1
final attempt : @entity1 launched consecutive sixes to get @entity4 close but it was n't quite enough all rounder : the former @entity11 captain showed he is still more than capable in both disciplines @entity1 was later moved to apologise to 25 - year - old @entity29 , after having a pop at the bowler as adrenaline rushed through his system			1
the potential of a match - winning innings had entered @entity1 's mind , and he blames that for blurring his judgement when he aimed a verbal volley at the bowler he had just carted over the ropes twice			1
' i had one of those horrible things where my eyes went a little bit , and i started to get really into it , ' @entity1 said			2
' i started to think ... ' i can win this , i 'm enjoying this , it 's brilliant this '			2
' i walked past him and he had a big grin on his face and he was staring at me			2
' i shouted at him , ' what are you looking at ? ' , but i put another word in			2
' it 's like shouting at strangers - i did n't even know him			0
i felt really bad - ' why have you done that ? '			0
' on fire : @entity1 is mobbed by his teammates after getting rid of @entity22 with his first ball of the match sorry : @entity29 received an apology from ' @entity1 ' after the pair exchanged verbals in the end , @entity1 and @entity4 fell short as @entity74 lifted the trophy on their home ground of @entity78 with a dramatic four - run victory over the @entity4			1
' we gave the crowd false hope			0
fair play to the @entity85 lads afterwards			0
they were deserving winners and i apologised to the big lad for shouting at him , ' @entity1 said			2
' if we 'd won it would have been a hundred times better			0
' speaking on his @entity1 and @entity93 podcast , @entity1 detailed how he had been training alone while filming a television show about fish and chips , taking bowling boots and a cricket ball with him on a trip to the @entity100 earlier in the week			1
' i practised well on friday , and i put myself in the frame but i did n't play the semi-final , i did n't expect to but there was the chance if someone went down injured i 'd get a game , ' he added			0
when @entity17 was ruled out of the final , the door opened			1
congratulations : an ever - graceful @entity1 offers his hand to @entity111 at the game 's conclusion ' i thought , ' how is this happening , it 's @entity116 and i 've been frying fish for three weeks , ' @entity1 said			2
' i warmed up well and had n't batted since the morning , and i thought ' i wo n't get in , i 'm number nine '			0
' @entity22 , a former @entity11 colleague of @entity1 's , was thrilled by @entity74 's success			1
he said on the @entity121 @entity120 channel : ' to win @entity13 is huge but to do it at home is unbelievable			0
' the guys should enjoy it over the next couple of weeks			0
it was a great day for @entity85			0
unbelievable : @entity22 ( left ) described winning the @entity6 trophy as meaning as much as @entity11 victories ' some of our batting in the middle was incredible			1
it was n't just brutal with power , it was clever as well			0
' it 's nice to pop in for one day of @entity6 among all the hard work of a season ! ' any chance i get to play for the club i love doing it			0
' when you win a trophy it means just as much as when you win for @entity11			1
