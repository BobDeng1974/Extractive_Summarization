as @entity22 keepers laid out her birthday cake this week , it was the gorilla 's surrogate mom , @entity25 , that led the still small @entity10 to her treat			1
seeing @entity10 enjoy her cake in the company of other gorillas was a proud moment for the @entity22 keepers , who had acted as surrogates to her for five months			1
