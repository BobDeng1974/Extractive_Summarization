a daring robotic mission to @entity3 's watery moon @entity1 could take place by 2025			2
@entity5 announced the plans this week in its 2015 budget proposal which would remain essentially flat at $ 17.5 billion ( £ 10.5 billion )			1
the space agency has set aside $ 15 million ( £ 9 million ) in its budget proposal to start planning some kind of mission to @entity12			1
scroll down for @entity13 @entity5 is making preparations to plan a robotic mission to @entity3 's watery @entity12 , a place where astronomers speculate there might be life @entity5 ’s chief financial officer @entity20 said the high radiation environment around @entity3 and distance from @entity23 would be a challenge			2
when @entity5 sent @entity26 to @entity3 in 1989 , it took the spacecraft six years to get to the fifth planet from the sun. @entity31 astronomer @entity30 said it could be ‘ a daring mission to an extremely compelling object in our solar system			0
’ past @entity5 probes have flown by @entity1 , especially @entity26 , but none have concentrated on the moon , one of dozens orbiting @entity3			2
president @entity42 's 2015 @entity5 budget plan includes funding for a robotic mission as well as space taxis to the @entity46 the proposed 2015 federal budget allocated $ 17.5 billion ( £ 10.5 billion ) to @entity5			1
the space agency has set aside $ 15 million ( £ 9 million ) to plan a robotic mission to @entity3 ’s moon , @entity12			1
@entity5 ’s budget also includes funding for a commercial ventures to fly to the @entity46 the agency could have $ 1.1 billion ( £ 600 million ) next year to help at least two companies develop commercial space taxis that would do this			1
the new budget also includes $ 3.1 billion ( £ 1.9 billion ) for @entity5 to operate the @entity46 it provides $ 2.8 billion ( £ 1.7 billion ) to continue development of the @entity61 heavy - lift rocket and @entity63 capsule for future human missions to the moon , asteroids and @entity67			1
planning for the so - called @entity68 gets a boost to $ 133 million ( £ 80 million ) in the 2015 budget proposal , up from $ 78 million ( £ 47 million ) in 2014			1
the proposed budget keeps the @entity73 successor program - an infrared observatory known as the @entity76 - on track for launch in 2018			1
it also lets @entity5 begin planning for a new telescope to probe the mysterious force known as ‘ dark energy ’ that is driving the universe apart at faster and faster rates			1
astronomers have long lobbied for a mission to @entity12 , but proposals would have cost billions of dollars			0
last year , scientists discovered liquid plumes of water shooting up through @entity1 's ice			0
flying through those watery jets could make @entity1 cheaper to explore than just circling it or landing on the ice , said @entity1 scientist @entity93			0
@entity5 will look at many competing ideas for a @entity1 mission , so the agency does n't know how big or how much it will cost , dr @entity97 said			2
she said a major mission goal would be searching for life in the strange liquid water under the ice - covered surface			0
@entity105 astronomer @entity104 said going to @entity1 would be more exciting than exploring dry @entity67			0
‘ there might be fish under the ice , ’ he said			0
@entity109 as a mission to @entity12 , president @entity42 's 2015 @entity5 budget includes funding for a commercial ventures to fly astronauts to the @entity46			1
the agency could have $ 1.1 billion ( £ 600 million ) next year to help at least two companies develop commercial space taxis to fly astronauts to and from the space station			1
the research outpost , a project of 15 nations , flies about 260 miles ( 420 km ) above @entity23			0
since the space shuttles were retired in 2011 , the @entity122 is dependent on @entity124 to fly crews to the space station at a cost of more than $ 65 million a seat			2
currently , @entity5 is supporting space taxi designs by , privately owned @entity130 and privately owned @entity131 which has developed the @entity132 ( pictured ) for now , escalating @entity122 tensions with @entity124 over the crisis in @entity136 have not affected the space partnership , @entity5 administrator @entity133 told reporters on a conference call			0
‘ we are continuing to monitor the situation , ’ mr @entity133 said			0
‘ right now , everything is normal in our relationship with the @entity124 ’			0
currently , @entity5 is supporting space taxi designs by , privately owned @entity130 and privately owned @entity131 the agency intends to select at least two companies for a final round of development funding this summer			0
@entity42 wants to have @entity122 options for flying astronauts to the station before the end of 2017			0
the so - called @entity154 program is receiving $ 696 million ( £ 417 million ) for the 2014 fiscal year ending september 30			2
the proposed funding increase would add as much as $ 400 million ( £ 240 million ) to the program for fiscal 2015			2
planning for the so - called @entity68 gets a boost to $ 133 million ( £ 80 million ) in the 2015 budget proposal , up from $ 78 million ( £ 47 million ) in 2014 the new budget also includes $ 3.1 billion ( £ 1.9 billion ) for @entity5 to operate the station and provides $ 2.8 billion ( £ 1.7 billion ) to continue development of the @entity61 heavy - lift rocket and @entity63 capsule for future human missions to the moon , asteroids and @entity67			1
one of the first operational @entity63 missions would send astronauts to an asteroid that has been robotically relocated into a high orbit around the moon			0
planning for the so - called @entity68 gets a boost to $ 133 million ( £ 80 million ) in the 2015 budget proposal , up from $ 78 million ( £ 47 million ) in 2014			2
as currently envisioned , hiking spending on the asteroid initiative means cutbacks in other programs , warns the @entity178 , a @entity179 - based industry advocacy organization			0
‘ we remain concerned and opposed to the annual effort to drain funds from our nation 's exploration programs , ’ the group said in a statement			0
the proposed budget keeps the @entity73 successor program - an infrared observatory known as the @entity76 - on track for launch in 2018			1
it also lets @entity5 begin planning for a new telescope to probe the mysterious force known as ‘ dark energy ’ that is driving the universe apart at faster and faster rates			1

@entity207 could have $ 1.1 billion ( £ 600 million ) for commercial flights to @entity46
budget has $ 2.8 billion ( £ 1.7 billion ) for rockets to launch manned missions
@entity76 , a successor to @entity73 , will launch in 2018
@entity210 also includes funds for a new telescope to probe dark energy
