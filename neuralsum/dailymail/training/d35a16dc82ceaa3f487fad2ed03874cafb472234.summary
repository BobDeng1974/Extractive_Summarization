we are used to seeing her dressed in aristocratic finery as @entity4 ’s @entity3			2
but @entity5 could n’t have looked further from her alter ego as she enjoyed a stroll with her boyfriend @entity8 earlier this week			2
miss @entity5 , 25 , wore tight denim jeans , with a ragged hole in one knee , which had been unevenly turned up at the ankles			1
and she was swamped by an over-sized blue knitted jumper , which had sleeves so long they hung down past her hands			0
it was a far cry from the elegant gowns and lace gloves she wears to play the rebellious great - niece of @entity42 ’s @entity41 , the @entity43 of @entity44 in the @entity46 period drama			0
cuddles : @entity5 smiled sweetly as the couple shared a walking embrace and @entity8 kissed the top of her head on the go : @entity8 was clutching coconut water as he indulged in a touching display of affection in @entity56 a protective arm : @entity8 , 31 , looked out protectively over @entity5 's head as she lifted her arm to hug him squeeze : a natural brunette , she looked completely comfortable wrapping both arms around her actor beau and miss @entity5 , who is leaving @entity4 after the fifth series , which begins next month , appeared to have already distanced herself from the role , by changing her hair colour from @entity67 ’s blonde to a version of her natural brunette			1
she was joined on her excursion in north @entity56 by @entity8 , 31 , a @entity72 , who was also dressed casually			1
he wore a dark hooded sweatshirt , which covered his head and dark glasses to hide his eyes			0
] in character : @entity8 spends his working days as a @entity78 , while @entity5 dons finery for a living leaving : she is moving on from @entity4 to concentrate on other projects , like next year 's @entity83 remake dapper : when not wearing a hoodie and sunglasses , @entity8 wears a dapper jacket and bow tie at work earlier this year miss @entity5 , who is leaving @entity4 to concentrate on other projects including a starring role in next year ’s @entity93 remake of @entity83 , admitted she does n’t like being recognised			1
she said : ‘ i ’m not on @entity96 and when i ’m not in character as @entity67 , i do n’t look much like her			0
' when @entity83 comes out , i ’m going to dye my hair back to my natural brown			2
i really do n’t want the kind of fame where everyone knows who i am			0
