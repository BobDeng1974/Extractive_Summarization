by @entity0 bungling border police burst into the ' sham ' wedding of two @entity4 workers and halted it before realising the marriage was real			1
@entity8 bride @entity7 , 34 , and @entity10 groom @entity9 , 31 , were taking their vows in @entity12 when four border police in thick black jackets stormed into the room			1
they led the pair and their two bridesmaids away into separate rooms and questioned them for 30 minutes before realising they had made a mistake			1
newly - wed : @entity7 , 34 , who was getting married to @entity23 , 31 , when border agency workers suddenly burst in the bride and groom were then allowed back into the room and they later got married			1
officials had become suspicious because the pair , who met at @entity4 in @entity31 , had trouble spelling each other 's surnames and the bride 's visa was due to expire in six weeks			1
the only guests at the wedding were the bridesmaids			0
they were so pleased that they were about to break up a sham wedding that they invited a local newspaper reporter from the @entity42 along to watch			0
@entity43 : @entity9 , a retail manager , who got married to his @entity8 partner but , when they realised they had made a mistake , the journalist was quickly ushered away			1
a worker for the @entity50 admitted afterwards : ' it is either the best sham wedding i have ever seen or it is real '			2
before the wedding ceremony began at 4pm last thursday plain - clothed officials from the @entity50 waited outside the town hall , in north @entity58 , while the border police hid out of sight in a car			1
officials usually wait until the wedding is underway to avoid the bride and groom fleeing			2
mr @entity9 listed his job title as a retail manager on his wedding certificate , while his bride wrote that she was a sales associate			2
the @entity70 for the @entity71 condemned the @entity50 and accused them of ' operating generally on a basis of mistrust ' when it came to international marriages			1
the wedding had been ' red flagged ' by @entity77 as a possible sham marriage in advance - and they had called in the @entity50 to investigate			2
the border police called in to carry out the raid are employed by the @entity50			1
however , the couple 's answers to questions about their relationship and life had matched up perfectly - and they had genuine bookings afterwards at a restaurant with friends and a hotel room for the night			0
store workers : the couple , an @entity10 man in his thirties and a @entity8 woman in her twenties , both work at @entity4 in @entity31 wedding venue : the couple tied the knot at @entity12 after @entity50 officials allowed the ceremony to go ahead an official added that the fact the couple were ' extremely good - looking ' and wearing expensive , tailored clothes , and had a real @entity105 handbag , would also have been a clue that it was genuine as visa weddings are frequently performed by ' very mismatched couples ' who turn up for the service in ' anoraks '			1
@entity111 , of the @entity70 for the @entity71 , added : ' that does not justify them operating generally on a basis of mistrust			0
they do not take people 's sides they automatically assume that people are out to swindle the visa regulations , that is their default position			0
that is what leads to this type of appalling mistake			0
' new bride : @entity7 , 34 , who tied the know with @entity10 @entity9 , 31 , after border agency officials wrongly raided their wedding thinking it was a sham romance : @entity7 was allowed to marry her new husband after border agency officials were convinced that their relationship was genuine he questioned why better background checks had not been made on the couple beforehand in order to avoid ruining their ceremony			1
' it does devastate wedding days , ' he said			0
' this is a life event where people 's expectations , money and energy is being poured into this one day and the @entity50 do n't seem to care about ruining it by not making better background checks			0
why did n't they interview them beforehand ? " a spokesman from @entity77 said : ' we are legally obliged to report any suspected sham marriages or civil partnerships to the @entity50 , based on the criteria outlined in the @entity155 of 1999			0
it is then for the @entity50 to decide how to progress and whether to take action			0
' a spokesman for the @entity50 said : ' where suspicions are raised that a marriage may not be genuine we will investigate			2
on this occasion no action was taken			0
' we continue to work closely with registrars to prevent people from abusing the marriage system in a bid to get round our immigration laws			0
