is there is one thing @entity2 is good at , it 's getting people 's attention			2
whether it 's wearing daring clothes , showing off her naked bottom or , like today , debuting an incredible and shocking new hair cut			2
for when the 34 - year - old mother - of - one stepped out in @entity12 today with her husband @entity13 she certainly made sure all eyes were on her with her bright blonde bob			1
but as she left the @entity30 for the @entity32 fashion show today she was clearly ready for the big reveal as she stepped proudly out in front of the paparazzi			0
this certainly is n't the first time that @entity2 has changed her hair colour - but it does seem to be her most extreme look yet			2

she told into @entity55 : ' for my hair , i do n't wash it every day			0
' we start out with a blowout on day one , then we go into a messier vibe the next day , and then we flat iron it and do a really sleek look on day three since that requires a little oil in the hair			0
' ' day four could be a slicked - back ponytail			0
on the fifth day is when you wash it			0
that 's a little excessive , maybe			0
