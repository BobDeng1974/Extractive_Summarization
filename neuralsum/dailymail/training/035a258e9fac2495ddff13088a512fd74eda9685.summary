' she said the photographs , which have documented @entity12 ’s progress since being in intensive care , are ' irreplaceable ' - especially as they contained the the very first family photograph			1
ms @entity1 said : ' we ’ve lost hundreds of photographs and they were all very special to me			1
' we very nearly lost @entity12 so i ’m always taking pictures on my phone trying to capture as many moments as i can			1
' but one of the most precious to me was our very first family photograph			0
' it was taken when @entity12 was just a few hours old , before we knew about her condition and before she was rushed into hospital			1
that ’s been stolen and we can never replace it			2
' she added that after @entity12 was admitted , the large doses of medication she was on meant she slept for weeks			1

' instead , they had formed a growth which turned toxic and killed her intestine , ' said ms @entity1			2
' she was in intensive care for a week and has had five operations , but now doctors are hoping she can be home by the end of september			0
' her intestine has been removed and she now has short bowel syndrome , which means she will always have to be on a special diet , but hopefully she will be ok			0
