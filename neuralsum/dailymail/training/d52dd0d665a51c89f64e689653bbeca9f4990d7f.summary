@entity0 has sparked a new round of backlash after defending her on - air comments about @entity5 's ' verifiably ' white skin - though she did admit her assertion that @entity7 was also @entity8 is ' far from settled			1
' @entity0 , 43 , took a sick day thursday but returned last night in full force to hit back at her critics who ridiculed her for declaring that ' @entity5 is white , ' and that @entity7 was also a white man on her @entity11 show			1
the comments came during a debate about a @entity15 article written by @entity16 who suggested a more inclusive festive icon - she proposed a penguin - become a new symbol of @entity22 cheer for children			1
she claimed that the segment was intended as a lighthearted , tongue - in - cheek discussion but that the humor was lost on some of her detractors			1
' humor is part of what we try to bring to the show			0
sometimes that 's lost on the humorless			2
' @entity0 's aggressive stance only added fuel to the fire saturday			2
journalist @entity49 penned a column for his news and opinion site @entity53 , attacking @entity0 's comment about @entity7 ' race not being a settled matter			1
‘ actually , it really is settled			0
but just like climate change , even if perhaps one per cent of the world ’s population disagrees , a settled fact is “ far from settled ” at @entity62 , ’ he wrote			0
the founder of the online journal also took issue with the anchor 's claim that her assertions were tongue - in - cheek			1
' perhaps all of @entity62 is really just a joke ? ' he wrote in his saturday column			0
letter to @entity5 : @entity75 host @entity74 read her open letter to @entity5 on her show , saying that it is an indication of how broad @entity81 's race and class divide is that some can not envision him as anything but white visit @entity85 for breaking news , world news , and news about the economy meanwhile , @entity75 host @entity74 spent a portion of her program saturday addressing the @entity92			1
in an open letter to @entity96 himself , @entity94 said that it is an indication of how broad @entity81 ’s race and class divide is that some can not envision @entity5 being anything but white , @entity93 reported			1
‘ i know it ’s a busy time of year , but we need to settle a little debate that ’s emerged in @entity81 media asking , “ are you white ? are you black ? when you come in from the @entity107 , do you have a legal visa or are you undocumented ? ” ’ @entity94 asked			2
‘ can you find a kid if he lives in an apartment building not a house without a chimney ? can you find her in a homeless shelter ? ’ she continued			0
‘ why do you leave so many more trees under the big trees in the wealthy neighborhood and so few under the trees in the poor communities ? ’ the tv presenter said that in her mixed race family , it was important to share with children depictions of role models and inspirational figures who remind them of themselves			0
‘ if we can not imagine you as racially different from ourselves , it ’s because our minds are stunted by a history that still ca n’t fathom benevolence , and kindness , and intimacy in the bodies of those who are not like us , ’ @entity94 said			0
‘ if we still doubt that you can embody every possibility of racial being , it is because we do not yet believe that every racial body is capable of making our sugar plum dreams come true			0
’ the anchor concluded by saying that if @entity81 can not even imagine @entity5 outside a racial context , it should not surprise anyone that a racial divide still exists in the @entity81 on wednesday , @entity0 said on the show that just because @entity5 's supposed white race makes some people , including @entity15 columnist @entity16 , uncomfortable , it does not mean that it has to change			1
controversy : @entity0 made her divisive comments on her show on wednesday during a discussion with a panel of speakers ' @entity7 was a white man , too			1
it 's like we have , he 's a historical figure that 's a verifiable fact , as is @entity5 , i just want kids to know that			2
how do you revise it in the middle of the legacy in the story and change @entity5 from white to black ? ' in fact , what @entity170 ' article suggested was neither a black nor a white @entity5 , but a black - and - white bird - a festive penguin			1
to that suggestion , @entity0 said @entity170 had ' gone off the rails			0
' when another panelist suggests this would make all kids feel equally welcome , she replied , ' @entity180 , it does n't ... it makes all birds feel welcome			0
' @entity0 said tonight that the reaction to the segment on her show would be funny if ' it were not so telling about our society , in particular the knee - jerk instinct by so many to race - bait - and to assume the worst in people			1
especially people employed by the very powerful @entity62			0
' she said that all she did was acknowledge that @entity5 is generally depicted as white - exactly as @entity170 did - and was unfairly accused of ' racial fear and loathing			1
' @entity0 also played several clips of other networks discussing her segment - she has been lampooned by the likes of @entity199 and @entity200			2
historical figure : contrary to @entity0 's statements , @entity202 was from modern @entity204 and would n't have born much resemblance to rosy - cheeked @entity5 ' the fact that an off - hand jest i made during a segment about whether @entity5 should be replaced by a penguin has now become a national firestorm says two things , ' @entity0 said			1
' race is still an incredibly volatile issue in this country , and @entity62 , and yours truly , are big targets for many people			0
' the comments @entity0 made about @entity5 were n't the only ones to be met with ridicule			1
' i also did say @entity7 was white			2
as i 've learned in the past two days , that is far from settled , ' was all @entity0 said about her statements pertaining to @entity7 ' skin color			1
watch the latest video at @entity227 new show : @entity62 anchor @entity0 attends the 6th @entity229 at @entity230 , inc on september 13 , 2010 in @entity231 classic @entity5 : as a fictitious representation of a @entity234 @entity202 - it is fair to assume that @entity5 was white the controversy was addressed by @entity236 , a scholar of religions and author of the recent bestseller zealot : @entity240 of @entity7			1
an expert , @entity236 said that ' as a @entity242 , he would have been what is referred to as a @entity245 jew			0
he would look the way that the average @entity245 would look today			0
so that would mean dark features , hairy , probably a longer nose , black hair , ' said @entity236 to the @entity251			0
@entity252 writing in the @entity253 was even harder on @entity0			0
' @entity0 ’s not wrong to say that @entity5 is @entity234 - that ’s his heritage			2
' but there ’s little chance that @entity7 is white , and asserting otherwise is just as ludicrous as the declaration - made by some @entity258 - that @entity7 spoke the early modern @entity259 of the @entity260			2
' at best , the assertion of @entity7 ’s whiteness reflects ignorance			0
at worst , it ’s a sign of racial prejudice			0

@entity0 was a no - show for @entity30 thursday night
she returned friday to address critics of her controversial statements about the color of @entity5 's skin
she said the ' humorless ' detractors did n't understand her ' tongue - in - cheek ' comments

on wednesday she said that both @entity5 and @entity7 were ' verifiably white '
she was *widely* derided for the statements made during a debate about an article that suggested a more inclusive symbol of @entity22 be created
@entity0 said the reaction was proof that there 's a knee - jerk instinct to race - bait
