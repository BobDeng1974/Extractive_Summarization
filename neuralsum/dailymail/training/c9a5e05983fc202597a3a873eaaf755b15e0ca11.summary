by @entity0 published : 11:46 est , 23 august 2013 updated : 13:44 est , 23 august 2013 squatters who have taken over @entity2 listed mansion in one of @entity6 's most expensive neighbourhoods today claimed they are of benefit to the building 's owner			1
the 300 - year - old property built in 1699 on @entity11 in @entity12 has been sitting empty for several years but has recently been taken over by a developer			1
but around 10 squatters have taken up residence in the @entity17 villa and are now suggesting that they can come to an ' arrangement ' with the owner that would be of ' mutual benefit '			1
new ' residents ' : approximately 10 squatters have moved in to 195 @entity11 , a @entity2 listed @entity17 villa built in 1699 , shortly after a new developer bought the property they placed a note in one of the building 's windows stating : ' we are very willing to negotiate an arrangement for our mutual benefit			1
' there are numerous benefits for having squatters in a disused building , we can provide / assist in upkeep , ensure security of the building and provide monetary benefits			0
' while some neighbours appear to have welcomed the squatters , others were frustrated that people are living rent - free while other residents pay thousands of pounds in rent every month			2
@entity47 , 36 , who runs a pop - up shop , told the @entity49 : ' we all work really hard			2
it ’s not right - this is a prime location			0
the rent for my three - bed flat which i share is £ 2,400 a month			0
' @entity56 up : @entity12 resident @entity57 wants the building , which has sat empty since 2003 , to be put to good use with a ' permanent solution ' another resident , film maker @entity63 , 34 , revealed he pays £ 1,900 a month for a one bedroom flat			1
while jewellery designer @entity57 , who has lived in @entity12 for 14 years , is fed up with the building being empty but wants a ' permanent solution to do it justice '			1
this is not the first time the building , which has been closed down since 2003 , has been taken over by squatters			2
for its first 150 years , the house was one of many grand family homes on @entity11			2
in 1860 it became the @entity76			0
@entity77 closed in 1913 and was then replaced by a working men ’s club , the @entity78 and @entity79 which later became the @entity80 and closed down in 2003			0
since then several developers have taken over the property , with one gaining permission to convert it into a restaurant and luxury flats			1
but each venture failed and by 2009 the building was still sitting empty and squatters moved in			1
the squatters organised community events and workshops until they were evicted a year later			2
while residential squatting is now a criminal offence , the currently law does n't apply to commercial buildings			0
the new squatters say they also want to see the building used to the benefit of the community			0
derelict : the squatters say they want the building to be used to the benefit of the local community instead of just sitting empty while developers ' wait for it to fall down ' one of the new ' residents ' @entity107 , 23 , originally from south - west @entity6 , told the @entity49 : ' the land is probably worth more than the building ... there is insurmountable damage and the costs to repair it would be a lot greater so the developer is waiting for it to fall down			1
we have not seen him , he has not been round			0
' if they wanted to fix it up and open it to the community then we would have no problem with that - it ’s the wasting we have a big issue with			0
' he added that they also hoped to campaign against proposed changes to the law which would make squatting in any type of property illegal .			0
