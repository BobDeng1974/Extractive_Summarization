by @entity0 the @entity1 described the research as ' an exciting development ' but stressed that early diagnosis is essential a cheap , simple blood test could save thousands from life - threatening blood pressure problems each year , scientists claimed last night			1
research from @entity9 suggests at least one in ten of @entity12 ’s 16million patients with high blood pressure could be cured if diagnosed early			1
the study centres around a form of the condition caused by tiny , benign tumours of the adrenal gland , a hormone - producing organ on top of the kidney			0
although it is particularly dangerous , it can be detected with a £ 15 test and wiped out by removing the tumours with keyhole surgery			1
this would remove the need for life - long blood pressure drugs and would also greatly reduce the odds of heart attacks , strokes and other potentially fatal conditions			1
the treatment works best for the under - forties , and up to 10,000 men and women in their twenties and thirties could benefit each year			0
the @entity1 described the research as ‘ an exciting development ’ , but stressed that early diagnosis was essential			0
high blood pressure affects a third of adults and trebles the risk of heart attacks and strokes			1
known as the silent killer , because the symptoms often go unnoticed until it is too late , it is the single biggest cause of death worldwide			0
the type caused by benign tumours of the adrenal gland is especially worrying			0
patients are five times more likely to have a heart attack than those whose blood pressure has been increased by other factors , such as smoking or stress			2
doctors have long known that the tumours increase blood pressure , but it was thought only a relatively small number of patients were affected			2
however , the @entity69 study , published in the journal @entity71 , suggests these adrenal tumours are responsible for one in ten cases of the condition			0
researchers took enhanced scans of men and women with high blood pressure to detect the tumours , which can be just 3mm across			1
they then removed the growths and analysed their dna			0
the tumours were long known to increase blood pressure but it had been thought they were behind a relatively small number of cases this showed the vast majority to have a mutation that increases production of aldosterone , a hormone that raises blood pressure			2
professor @entity95 , of the team that carried out the study , said : ‘ we think these could be present in up to 10 per cent of all people with high blood pressure			1
‘ these have to be diagnosed in young people if removing them is going to completely remove the high blood pressure and save them from a lifetime of drugs			1
’ the tumours can be detected by an ‘ exquisitely accurate ’ and inexpensive blood test and then removed			0
patients typically need two days in hospital for keyhole surgery and a fortnight off work			0
the operation works best in the under - forties , when removing the tumours should mean blood pressure returns to normal			2
as the tumours do not grow back , the patient is cured and no longer needs medication			0
at the moment , this operation is done only about 300 times year			0
professor @entity95 , an honorary consultant physician at @entity123 in @entity69 , estimates the number who could benefit is around 30 times higher			0
he wants those in their twenties and thirties whose blood pressure is found to be high during a routine doctor ’s appointment to be given the blood test			1
he added : ‘ most people have their blood pressure tested at least every five years			2
’ although the operation can be done on those over 40 , it is less successful because years of high blood pressure have taken their toll on the body			1
professor @entity142 , of the @entity1 , which part - funded the study , said : ‘ it is an exciting development , as this group of patients can be completely cured of high blood pressure			1

at least 10 *%* of the 16 million cases of high blood pressure are curable
@entity9 research suggests it can be detected using £ 15 test
it would also greatly reduce the odds of heart attacks , strokes and other potentially fatal conditions
