by @entity0 published : 13:31 est , 24 september 2012 updated : 14:23 est , 24 september 2012 greatly missed : @entity1 , from @entity2 , died aged 14 last march after a long battle with cancer			2
friends of a 14 - year - old boy who died after a long battle with cancer are being sent home from school for refusing to remove wristbands worn in his memory			1
@entity1 , from @entity2 , was diagnosed with a tumour behind his eye in 2008 and died aged 14 last march tribute wristbands in memory of @entity18 were sold at his school , the @entity19 , following his death , with all proceeds donated to the @entity23 charity			1
friends of the teenager bought the bands and have worn them ever since , but now the school has banned pupils from wearing them , saying they are not part of the uniform , his mother @entity24 said			1
one pupil , a close friend of @entity18 ’s , has even been sent home for refusing to remove the wristband			1
while the school has offered a compromise , saying it will pay for a cover , designed by the pupils , for their planners in memory of @entity18 , mrs @entity24 said the wristbands have sentimental value			1
the 45 - year - old , from @entity2 , said : ' @entity18 was a former pupil of the @entity19 and was , still is , a much - loved and valued friend of these students			2
' when he passed away in march 2011 from cancer , i and my family found a great deal of comfort from the many thoughts and actions of these young people			2
they showed great compassion and a maturity far beyond their years			0
' they are a credit to the @entity19			0
they gave and continue to do so , a sincere commitment to fundraising for the @entity23 and i believe the positive feeling this created has helped them to deal with their grief			1
' all of them should be congratulated for having such strong and caring values			0
the @entity19 should recognise this , encourage and be very proud of them			0
' offending articles : the wristbands were sold at the school following @entity18 's death in march last year with all proceeds donated to the @entity23 charity mrs @entity24 said the school had been happy for the children to wear the bands for the last 18 months and it was only in the last few weeks she had heard of pupils being told to remove them or face disciplinary action			1
she added : ' the bands do not affect their learning but it is their way of showing respect and keeping a part of @entity18 with them			2
a quote from one of @entity18 ’s friends was ‘ i write with my right hand and my band is on my left , when i am struggling or going through a tough time , i just look at my band and remember what a brave hero @entity18 was and all that he went through ’			0
' the school principal , @entity95 , told her last week that she was unaware the pupils had been wearing the bands			1
' if that is the case , then it proves the point that the bands are unobtrusive and not distracting in any way ' , mrs @entity24 said			0
she added : ' i am very angry and shocked but even more so heartbroken for the students , that after all these months have passed , they are now being asked or rather told to remove their bands by @entity107 , which i believe is bad judgment and leadership			0
what is this teaching the students ? ' @entity114 , whose son @entity115 was a friend of @entity18 ’s , said she was disgusted when the school rang to say her son was being sent home for refusing to take off his wristband			1
@entity19 banned pupils from wearing the bands saying they are not part of the uniform ms @entity114 said : ' i do n’t think the headteacher realises how much @entity18 ’s death affected them			1
the bands have sentimental value and mean so much to the kids			0
' my son @entity115 played football with @entity18 since they were seven and this morning i got a call from the school to say he was being sent home as he had refused to take the band off			1
' @entity137 , whose son @entity138 was a close friend of @entity18 ’s and attends the academy , has launched a petition urging the school to rethink the wristband ban			1
some 350 parents and children have already signed			0
mrs @entity137 said : ' the children are n’t being difficult			0
they went on a journey with @entity18 from the time he was diagnosed and just want to keep him with them until june next year when they finish school , just as he would ’ve been had he not been cruelly taken			2
' i ’m extremely proud of all the lads and girls that are making a stand for something they truly believe to be wrong			0
' their commitment to honouring @entity18 ’s memory and their support for @entity24 and the rest of the family is humbling			0
' i look forward to that phone call home , as do the rest of the parents because we fully support and admire the stance our kids are taking ' no one was available at the school for comment .			2

wristbands were sold at the school with all proceeds donated to the @entity23 charity
