by @entity0 published : 07:43 est , 27 april 2012 updated : 08:05 est , 27 april 2012 the @entity3 dairy cow found to have mad cow disease had been euthanized after it became lame and started lying down , federal officials revealed in their latest update on the discovery			2

euthanized : a cow was killed after it was found to have mad cow disease the @entity7 did n't elaborate on the cow 's symptoms other than to say it was ' humanely euthanized after it developed lameness and became recumbent '			0
outward signs of the disease can include unsteadiness and incoordination			0
routine testing at a transfer facility showed the dead @entity31 , which was destined for a rendering plant , had mad cow disease , or bovine spongiform encephalopathy			1
rendering plants deal with ' leftover ' parts of cows that are n't suitable for human consumption - such as the hair and hooves			0
in the recent ' pink slime ' scandal a small amount of rendered meat was found to have been used in some foods			0
the results were announced tuesday			0
it was the fourth case of mad cow disease ever discovered in the @entity8 @entity50 : the 10 - year - old cow was killed after it became lame and started lying down animals at greater risk for the disease include those with symptoms of neurological disease , ' downer ' animals at slaughterhouses , animals that die at dairies or cattle ranches for unknown reasons , and cows more than 2 1/2 years old , because @entity66 occurs in older cows			1
@entity8 health officials say there is no risk to the food supply , as the @entity3 cow was never destined for the meat market but on thursday @entity74 became the first country to suspend imports of @entity8 beef following the discovery of the infected cow			1
on friday government officials in @entity81 were carrying out checks on all @entity8 imports			1

suspicious : @entity81 government inspectors check the imported @entity8 beef at a cold storage on friday			0
on thursday @entity74 became the first country to suspend imports of @entity8 beef somehow , a protein the body normally harbors folds into an abnormal shape called a prion , setting off a chain reaction of misfolds that eventually kills brain cells			2
in other countries , @entity66 's spread through herds was blamed on making cattle feed using recycled meat and bone meal from infected cows , so the @entity8 has long banned feed containing such material			1
the last two cases found in the @entity8 were atypical as well .			0

cow from top dairy - producing county was 10 years old when it was euthanized
@entity7 : the killing was ' humane '
' no risk to food supply ' as cow was intended for rendering plant , not the meat market
