the vessel was reported missing on thursday evening			1
desperate efforts to find his two companions continued amid hopes mr @entity9 and mr @entity10 could have taken to the liferaft of the boat when they ran into difficulty			1
but these were dashed when the raft was discovered on board the wreck at 11am today			1
@entity46 's @entity45 manager @entity44 said : ' after a prolonged and extensive three - day search , sadly , the time has now passed when we could have hoped that the two remaining crew members from the @entity17 would be found alive			0
' our final area of investigation was to search for the missing liferaft in the hope that they had been able to board it before the vessel sank , but sadly this new information means that this search will now be terminated			1
' our thoughts are with the families of all three crewmen at this difficult time			0
' the 36ft wooden vessel - discovered by a survey ship lying ten miles off the @entity30 coast - is thought to have broken up suddenly and sunk after getting swamped by choppy seas off @entity67			1
the 50 - year - old boat , the @entity17 , disappeared so quickly that the three men did n’t have the chance to put out a @entity72 alert			0
the same boat was involved in two incidents last year , once in june when the skipper lost two fingers and was airlifted to hospital			1
the other was in january last year when the boat began to take on water and had to be towed to safety by the @entity82			0

it is one of the ships helping to search for the missing fishing vessel coastguards repeatedly tried to contact the crew over the vhf radio but were met with silence			1

' i 'm just listening to the news now and waiting			0
i have n't seen him in the last couple of years because i moved to @entity126			0
' but he 's a hard - working lad , he 's always down on the harbour in the summer crabbing and getting holiday maker to do it too			0
he has a lot of friends			0
' ocean : a map released by @entity145 shows the ongoing search operation south of @entity67 near @entity147 in @entity30 @entity148 , a local skipper , said no one knew what had happened but working with pots could be dangerous			1
he said : ' if you are pulling in pots and one gets stuck and it can pull the boat down and then if a wave hits you and everyone is on deck there might not be time to raise the alarm			0
' @entity163 , another skipper , said : ' they were working with whelking pots as i understand it			2
' they were moving the gear from one place to another which is a normal operation			0
we just all hope they are safe			0
' @entity175 , the secretary of the @entity147 and @entity176 and @entity177 , said : ' there was a life raft on board and there is a chance the men are in that and have been blown up and down the @entity185 and are awaiting rescue			2
' the sea conditions for yesterday were said to have been reasonable , although the sea swell built up to a choppy state by the afternoon			1
@entity190 , a spokesman for @entity29 coastguard which is co-ordinating the operation , said : ' the boat went out yesterday morning and was seen leaving the harbour at 8.30am			2
' we received a call at 5.40pm from a fisherman who was concerned about the @entity17			0
the vessel ’s buyers who had been waiting back at port had been unable to make contact with the men for a while			2
' we commenced a major air and sea search for the @entity17 but with no specific location we went over its usual fishing grounds which are up to six miles off @entity67			2
' we have tried to make contact with the vessel over the vhf radio but received nothing back			2
' we also made vhf broadcasts to alert other vessels of the search and also to request any vessels that could assist in the search			0
we are in touch with the men ’s families and the police			0
' we obviously live in hope of finding the men and we will continue with this search and keep going for the best part of today			0
