was that the fried onions mingling with the fumes from the water treatment plant , nearby ? was it the scent of fear from the @entity7 bench ? @entity8 was that the magic of the @entity10 drifting through the @entity12 air ? there were moments , at least , when @entity15 must have been worried			1
@entity16 had recovered from an early set - back , were making chances and threatening @entity19 's goal			1
the stars from the @entity21 were far from their comfort zone			2
' you come to a stadium like this in that type of game and it 's very difficult , ' said @entity15			2
' i thought we started the game well and then we lost our shape and presented them with chances by giving the ball away cheaply in the final 15 minutes of the first half			2
@entity36 performed for @entity7 on a night that could have seen a third - round slip - up in @entity39 @entity40 - affectionately nicknamed ' @entity41 ' - provided a magical moment for @entity16 ' we had to defend right through to the end			1
these are tricky cup ties			0
it was a very tough game , but we showed the character to pull through			0
my players deserve some credit for that			0
' there is always something special about the sight of elite footballers stepping from their pampered bubble , off the team bus and straight into the land of reality in the third round of the @entity10 , amid a phalanx of portable toilets and scaffolding			1
local roofer @entity62 , who sponsors one of the stands at @entity65 , must have cancelled his @entity67 holidays to rig up the temporary television studios , commentary booths and elevated camera stands required to beam this cup tie around the world			0
@entity65 is a tidy ground – befitting of a club so closely associated with the @entity75 – but there were new bits were sticking up at all angles			0
@entity36 , though , scored a wonderful free - kick to put @entity7 2 - 1 up , taking them through to the next round when the @entity7 captain leaves for @entity82 , he will not experience anything like he did on monday night what did @entity84 make of it all , as he huddled with the substitutes on the bench ? did he pick up a wi - fi signal for his @entity90 ? did he enjoy his brief encounter , even if he found scoring no easier against a @entity93 team ? will @entity36 miss occasions like this when he packs up his boot bag and heads across the @entity98 ? will he miss the cramped dressing rooms and claustrophobic corridors at close quarters with someone wearing an old @entity104 costume ? in the @entity82 , @entity36 will encounter professional athletes built just like @entity40 ... but they will be playing in the @entity106			1
it is hard to imagine he will ever encounter another footballer of quite the same size and power when he departs @entity111 in the summer			1
@entity40 tormented @entity7 at times , scored the goal which wiped out @entity36 's opener and typified @entity16 's spirit			1
@entity15 , who himself started his coaching career down the leagues , speaks to @entity118 gerrard scores the opening goal for @entity7 against @entity16 in the @entity10 third round he was booked for his muscular brand of domination and appeared utterly exhausted by the end , but he and strike partner @entity125 , a former lifeguard , provided a gentle nod towards the club 's @entity128 traditions			1
' when we go forward , we 're decent , ' said @entity16 manager @entity118			2
' it 's not easy to mark @entity40 and @entity132 is sharp around the box			0
it 's stuff they 're not really used to in the @entity21			0
we tried to give them a different challenge			0
' a blue - and - yellow flag bearing @entity40 's nickname ' @entity41 ' scrawled in blood - red , hung behind @entity19 's goal in the first - half , haunting the goalkeeper as he collided with the striker before the @entity16 man scored the goal which sparked such great excitement			1
at one point in the second half , they took to taunting @entity19 by simply singing : ' @entity150 … ' @entity36 played for @entity7 for the first time since announcing he will leave at the end of the 2014/15 season @entity36 will meet sportsmen built like @entity40 in the @entity82 - but they will be @entity82 footballers @entity155 , indeed			1
they accused the @entity7 fans , squeezed into one corner of the ground of not making enough noise , and being from the north			2
' @entity21 , you 're having a laugh , ' they sang			0
all of which made for terrific fun , as the @entity166 huffed and puffed on the field , but they came through the test , largely thanks to a vintage ' superman ' display from their skipper , which sent the locals home wondering what might have been			2
' there 's an element of disappointment for me , ' said @entity118			0
' a little more quality and nous and we might have got something from that			0
one rash moment and it proved to be decisive			0
' he was talking about the free - kick conceded , from which @entity36 curled in the winning goal and ruined the @entity16 dream			1
maybe , this year , the magic of the @entity10 will be reserved for a fairytale for the departing @entity7 hero .			1

@entity36 scored twice as @entity7 beat @entity16 on monday
the departing @entity7 captain will not experience anything like this when he leaves @entity111 football at the end of the season
for half an hour , an upset looked possible when @entity16 scored
@entity36 delivered a superman *performance* , but will he be treated to a fairytale exit by lifting the @entity10 in may ?
