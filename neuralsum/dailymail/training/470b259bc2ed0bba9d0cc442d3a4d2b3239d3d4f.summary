wind farms will never be able to ensure the nation ’s lights stay on because they are ‘ expensive and deeply inefficient ’ , it is claimed today			1
confirming the long - held fears of many critics , a new study published by the right - leaning @entity5 and the @entity6 argues the green energy revolution has been an expensive folly			0
researchers found that , on average , wind farms produce 80 per cent of their potential power output for less than one week annually – and they manage 90 per cent output for only 17 hours a year			1
ineffective : thousands of turbines are useless in low winds and they are turned off to prevent damage if the speeds are too high			0

families and businesses have paid billions of pounds to subsidise the building of wind farms , both on - shore and off - shore , through their energy bills , sending tariffs soaring			1
the schemes are key to the government ’s promise to switch to green energy , reducing the nation ’s carbon emissions in line with @entity42 and @entity43 targets to tackle man - made global warming			1
the study , entitled @entity46 : a review of the @entity42 wind resource for electricity generation , recommends pushing ahead with nuclear power and gas - fired power stations			2
@entity53 , head of policy at the @entity5 , said : ‘ wind farms are a bad way of reducing emissions and a bad way of producing power			2
‘ they are expensive and deeply inefficient and it seems like they reduce the value of housing enormously in nearby areas			0
promise : the @entity67 have already pledged to end subsidies for new wind farms as @entity42 is set to meet @entity43 targets , which decree that 15 per cent of energy is generated by renewable sources by 2020			1
( file image ) defending turbines , trade body @entity74 claimed : ‘ wind power has been quietly powering millions of homes and providing a robust response to detractors			2
’ the conservative party has already pledged to end subsidies for new wind farms as @entity42 is set to meet @entity43 targets			1
the @entity43 @entity81 decrees that 15 per cent of all energy in the @entity42 - or 30 to 35 per cent of electricity - is generated by renewable sources by 2020			2
the @entity85 said the country needs a wide mix of energy sources			0
it said : ‘ we 're preventing a predicted energy crunch by turning round a legacy of underinvestment and neglect			0
‘ to deliver this , we need a diverse energy mix that includes renewable sources like wind and solar alongside nuclear and technologies like carbon capture and storage so we can continue to use fossil fuels in a cleaner way			0
