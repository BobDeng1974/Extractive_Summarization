just went you thought it was warm enough to go into the water … killer seals have been spotted off the @entity5 coast			1
on four separate occasions , grey seals have been spied feasting on harbour porpoises that they have killed			1
and that far from scavenging on dead animals , they attack healthy creatures video footage of one of the attacks shows a male contentedly ripping chunks of blubber off his prey , as the water all around turns bloody			2
although killer seals are known to lurk in the waters off the continent , this is the first time they have been seen around @entity34			1
and with porpoises similar in size to grown men , it raises concerns that swimmers could be next			2
@entity41 , an ecologist for the @entity43 environment agency , said that while people should n’t panic , they should keep their distance from seals , on land and in the water			2
the footage , the first in the world , was shot by a wildlife cruise company , off the coast of @entity55			1
@entity56 , who made the recording , said : ‘ i ’ve been working on this stretch of the coast but have never seen anything like it before			2
the footage ( pictured ) , the first in the world , was shot by a wildlife cruise company , off the coast of @entity65 ferocious : scientists said the seals may have developed a taste for porpoises after sampling some caught in fishing nets ( stock image shown ) and warned that people could be next ‘ it was really surprising to see			1
’ grey seals are known for being playful and friendly			1
found all around @entity34 ’s coastline , they can grow to 40 stone but normally feed on fish no bigger than salmon			1
however , they have recently been blamed for attacks on porpoises on the continent			1
recent @entity85 research concluded that hundreds of the dead porpoises bore the tell - tale marks of a seal attack			2
the study said that the seals seemed to have a particular penchant for young porpoises with a thick layer of energy - packed fat			1
the seals , which are normally prey for great white sharks , have been seen attacking and killing medium - sized blue sharks ( pictured ) while most people will be familiar with images of seals being violently smashed out of the water snatched in the jaws of a shark , it appears some are exacting their revenge on the ocean predators			0
scientists have reported multiple cases of cape fur seals attacking blue sharks off the coast of @entity113			1
the seals , which are normally prey for great white sharks , have been seen attacking and killing medium - sized blue sharks , devouring their guts before leaving the rest of the carcass			0
divers also report seeing the fur seals attacking other species of shark and rays			0
the behaviour has left marine biologists baffled as to why the seals , which normally hunt smaller fish , have turned to attacking the torpedo - shaped sharks			0
the blue sharks are around the same size as the seals and it is thought to be the first time a seal has been seen preying on such a large predator			1
it was first observed by marine photographer @entity135 , who runs a dive boat operation from @entity137 in @entity113			0
and that far from scavenging on already dead animals , they were attacking healthy creatures			0
the @entity142 researchers said the seals may have developed a taste for porpoises after sampling some caught in fishing nets			2
and with many of the mutilated carcasses washing up on beaches popular with swimmers , they warned people could be next			0
although killer seals are known to lurk in the waters off the continent , this is the first time they have been seen around @entity34 ( @entity55 marked ) they said : ‘ keep on swimming and enjoying nature			1
however , people should be aware that the largest predator in our countries is the grey seal			0
‘ these animals may reach 40 stone , are related to bears and have the teeth to go with that lineage			0
‘ in the water , they are much more able than the most agile human swimmers and they have made the switch from eating fish to hunting porpoises , another mammal			2
‘ to date , there have been no reports of serious attacks or wounds inflicted , but some people have been bitten by inquisitive or provoked seals			0
‘ the advice would thus be to be aware that seals are not out there to cuddle and to keep some distance			0
’ dr @entity41 , who has done his own research for @entity65 , said that despite reports of seals eating porpoises off the coast of @entity191 , @entity192 and the @entity85 , he was surprised to discover it happening here			1
he said : ‘ we observed this happening on four separate occasions off the coast of @entity55			1
‘ but it is unclear how long this has been going on for , and why			0
’ @entity65 said that growing seal numbers may mean there is increasing competition for food			0
not such a gentle giant : grey seals ( stock image pictured ) were known for being playful and friendly			1
found all around @entity34 ’s coastline , they can grow to 40 stone but normally feed on fish no bigger than salmon bloodthirsty : experts have warned that seals are ' not out there to cuddle and advise to keep some distance alternatively , the attacks may be an example of ‘ opportunistic hunting ’ – with porpoises too close for hungry seals to ignore			1
dr @entity41 , a senior marine mammal ecologist , said : ‘ adult grey seals have also been known to attack , kill and eat juvenile grey seals , so this type of activity is n’t totally surprising and is likely part of the natural cycle of life			1
‘ seals are unlikely to pose any direct danger to people			0
however , they are wild animals that possess sharp teeth and are a protected species , so they should not be approached on land or in the water , particularly during the autumn pupping season			0
’ this is not the first time the seal ’s cuddly image has been tarnished			0
in november , it emerged that @entity245 fur seals had been raping king penguins			0
one penguin was then killed – and eaten			0
@entity34 is home to up to 170,000 grey seals – almost half the world ’s population			1
at up to 8ft 6in long and weighing 40st , they are the biggest and most common of the two types of seal found in the @entity34 and can live for up to 35 years			2
their thick blubber and waterproof fur insulate them from the cold , while high levels of haemoglobin – the part of red blood cells that carries oxygen around the body – allow them to stay under water for up to 16 minutes at a time			0
the largest of @entity34 ’s carnivores , they have highly sensitive whiskers and acute sense of hearing to help them locate food – normally fish – with even blind seals having no trouble catching prey			1
once hunted for their skins , blubber and meat , seals were the first animals to be protected by modern wildlife laws			2
they can be shot under licence by fishermen if they are damaging nets .			0

on four occasions , grey seals were spied eating porpoises they had killed
although killer seas are known to lurk in the waters off the continent , this is the first time they have been seen around @entity34
the footage , the first in the world , was shot by a wildlife cruise company , off the coast of @entity55
