a new @entity1 poll shows that the majority of @entity3 do n't want president @entity4 calling all the shots anymore			1
@entity3 say by a large margin that they 'd rather @entity4 back off and let @entity7 take the lead in the new @entity9 than the other way around			1
the poll supports @entity7 claims that last week 's midterm elections were in fact a referendum on the president - an assessment the @entity18 has forcibly denied both before and after the president 's party was walloped at the ballot box			2
after his party 's candidates were demolished in the off - year elections and exit polls showed that a third of voters came out to send the president a message of opposition - compared to just 19 percent who said they were voting that day to support @entity4 - the president still vowed to forge ahead with his agenda , regardless of anyone else 's opinion on the matter			2
' my job over the next couple of years is to do some practical , concrete things as much as possible with @entity9 , ' @entity4 said during a post-election press conference last wednesday			1
' where it ’s not possible with @entity9 , ' he said , i 'll do it ' on my own , to show people why we should be confident and to give people a sense of progress and a sense of hope			1
' but just 36 percent of respondents to @entity1 's latest survey said they wanted @entity4 to set the agenda moving forward			2
more than half , 53 percent , said they thought @entity7 ' plans should be given more weight than the presidents			1
the poll , taken after the election from nov. 6 - 9 , indicates that voters did indeed mean the midterm elections to be a realignment of leadership and priorities			0
if warnings in the weeks before midterms as well as the elections themselves were n't enough to convince the @entity18 to change tack , it 's unlikely that a new polling will change the president 's calculus , either , however			0
at his presser last week president @entity4 indicated that he would make no policy shifts nor would he significantly change his approach to working with republicans on @entity93 despite the previous evening 's loses			1
@entity4 said he 's always tried to seek out compromise with republicans whenever he can , and he intends to keep doing that			1
pressed to name a change he would make ' to address the concerns that voters expressed ' with him and his administration , @entity4 said that as the ' guy who ’s elected by everybody ' and not just voters from a certain state or congressional district , @entity3 ' want me to push hard to close some of these divisions , break through some of the gridlock , and get stuff done			1
' so , the most important thing i can do is just get stuff done and help @entity9 get some things done , ' he said , suggesting that he would work harder to force @entity7 ' hands than he did before his party was publicly reprimanded by voters			1
@entity3 clearly want @entity4 to follow @entity7 ' lead and not the other way around , a @entity1 poll released this afternoon shows he also committed to going around newly elected @entity7 officials to make changes to the country 's immigration rules , arguing that he 's already given @entity7 lawmakers who are currently serving in federal office an opportunity to stop him by passing comprehensive immigration reform legislation			1
now it 's his turn at the wheel , he said			0
' i think it ’s fair to say that i have shown a lot of patience and have tried to work on a bipartisan basis as much as possible , ' he contended			0
' and i ’m going to keep on doing so			0
but in the meantime , let ’s figure out what we can do lawfully though executive actions to improve the functioning of the existing system			0
' days later , president @entity4 was still refusing to give an inch to @entity7 when he sat down with @entity145 anchor @entity144 for a special edition of its hit sunday morning program @entity150			1
again asked what he plans to do differently in light of the recent election results , @entity4 said he told his team it needs to do a better job convincing republicans to get on board with the @entity18 's plans			1
' we 've got to sell it , we 've got to reach out to the other side and where possible persuade , ' he said			0
' and i think there are times , there 's no doubt about it where , you know , i think we have not been successful in going out there and letting people know what it is that we are trying to do and why this is the right direction , ' he said , chalking up @entity30 loses to ' a failure of politics			0
' the only valid criticism of his administration that @entity4 was willing to admit to @entity144 was giving up too quickly on fighting a ' pretty stubborn ' opposition			2
likewise , at a briefing on thursday with reporters @entity18 flak @entity178 blamed election loses on @entity7 obstructionism			0
' they may be able to say with some credibility that they did benefit politically from obstructing the president ’s agenda at every turn			0
i do n't think the country benefited from that , though , ' @entity178 told reporters			0
' and i do n't just say that because @entity7 are now in the majority			2
' i just think that there was a lot of very important things that did n't get done that could have , had the president found more willing partners among @entity7 , ' he opined			2
@entity178 said he does n't expect @entity7 to completely reecalibrate once they officially take over @entity9 in january , but he does hope they will be more open to @entity30 - backed legislation			1
' again , it does n’t mean that there are going to be daily renditions of @entity205 sung on @entity206 , but i do think that we can be at least a little more optimistic that where common ground exists , that @entity30 and @entity7 can move together on it , ' he said			0
if voters expected @entity4 to step aside during the final two years of his presidency and let the @entity7 - led @entity9 chart the nation a new course , they would appear to be woefully mistaken based on @entity4 's behavior in the last week			1
@entity4 told reporters last wednesday that he planned ' to squeeze every last little bit of opportunity ' out of his presidency to shape the nation			2
' the one thing i ’m pretty confident about ... is , i ’m going to be busy for the next two years , ' he noted			0
' and the one thing that i want the @entity3 people to be confident about is that every day , i ’m going to be filling up my time trying to figure out how i can make their lives better			1
' and if i ’m doing that , at the end of my presidency , i ’ll say , “ we played that fourth quarter well , and we played the game well			0
” and the only difference between , i guess , basketball and ... politics is that the only score that matters is how ’d somebody else do , not how you did			0
and that ’s the score i ’m keeping			0

@entity3 say by a large margin that want @entity4 to back off and let republicans take the lead in the new @entity9
but @entity4 still plans to act alone on immigration and other policies @entity7 wo n't get on board with
' where it ’s not possible with @entity9 , ' @entity4 said last wednesday , i 'll do it ' on my own , to show people why we should be confident '
