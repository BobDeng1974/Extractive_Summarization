that is n't an excuse			0
i did n't even know who [ @entity30 ] was until i was arrested and told by the police what she was about			0
' of course , i support woman 's rights , being one myself			0
i 'm ashamed of my behaviour and like i 've previously stated i wo n't be doing anything like this again			0
' she said she made the comments to ' help people in the future to not make the same mistake that i have , [ if ] that only be just one person , then it will be worth it ' the threats started in july last year after the @entity83 revealed @entity84 would replace @entity85 as the face of the £ 10 note following a campaign spearheaded by ms @entity30			0

but she deluged @entity117 with menacing messages claiming that she had just been released from prison , writing : ‘ i will find you and you do n’t want to know what i will do when i do , you ’re pathetic , kill yourself before i do			2
’ other vile messages included : ‘ i ’ve only just got out of prison and would happily do more time to see you berried ! ! ’ ( sic ) and ‘ rape ? ! i ’d do a lot worse things than rape you ! ! ’ troll : @entity10 attempted to justify her actions on @entity1 shortly after being asked to stop making threats rant : @entity10 continued her @entity1 rant despite police intervention @entity10 was arrested in october 2013 at her home in @entity16 and admitted to police that she had sent some of the tweets , suggesting she had been ' off my face on drink ' at the time , the court heard			1

she tweeted a statement saying : ' i am hugely relieved that these two defendants have pleaded guilty , meaning that there is no need for a trial and for the whole process to drag on longer - it has already dragged on for almost six months , with all the attendant anxiety you 'd expect			1
' this is not a joyful day ; these two abusers reflect a small drop in the ocean , both in terms of the amount of abuse i received across july and august , but also in terms of the abuse that other women receive online - women who have little to no recourse to justice			0
' however , i hope that for some people who are watching , this conviction will be a warning : online abuse is not consequence - free			0
i hope that some people watching will think twice before abusing someone else			0
there is not much else i can say given there are other cases still on - going			0
