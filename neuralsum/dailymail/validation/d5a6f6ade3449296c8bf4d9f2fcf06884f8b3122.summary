@entity1 staff are embroiled in a bitter dispute over who gets to control the @entity5 magazine , months after eight of its writers and cartoonists were murdered by terrorists			1
the row was sparked by a sudden increase in the magazine 's sales and revenue in the wake of the brutal attacks on january 7 , according to the @entity18			1
it has reportedly made £ 21.6million since then after its usual circulation of 30,000 - a - week rocketed to hundreds of thousands			1
now the surviving staff members want that money and shares of the magazine - 40 per cent of which are owned by its murdered editor 's parents - to be divided equally			1

40 per cent of the company is owned by his parents , another 40 by the magazine 's new editor @entity76 and the final 20 per cent belongs to financial director @entity78			2
one of the magazine 's journalists @entity81 said : ' a new distribution of the capital would allow for the incredible influx of funds to the newspaper to be used in the most transparent manner possible			2
' and @entity88 - who writes a column for @entity1 - believes a co-operative would bind contributors to the newspaper			0

it is not a question of sharing the cake			0
the money does not interest us			0
