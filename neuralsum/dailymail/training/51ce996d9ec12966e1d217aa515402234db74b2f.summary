@entity0 was facing an @entity2 backlash at @entity3 last night over the rush to hand @entity6 sweeping new powers			1
the prime minister yesterday confirmed that @entity6 would get ‘ major new powers over tax , spending and welfare ’ if it voted @entity8 to independence next week			1
@entity14 and @entity15 are also pledging a major transfer of powers in a last - ditch bid to persuade @entity6 to keep the @entity19 together			1
but the move provoked alarm among @entity22 , who last night warned it would be ‘ untenable ’ for @entity6 to be handed new powers without major reform of its voting rights at @entity3 and generous funding settlement			1
he later told the @entity42 that devolved matters such as health , education and local government would have to be reserved for @entity2 mps as part of any new settlement – and said this could even result in the creation of an @entity2 government			2
he said : ‘ i understand why the party leaders are making these offers , but it opens up the whole @entity2 issue in a way they have not thought through			2
‘ this is a very big recasting of the relationship with @entity6 and many people feel that what is good enough for @entity6 should be good enough for @entity2 too			1
@entity6 's first minister @entity62 campaigns for a @entity64 vote in east @entity65 today ‘ you can not insult @entity2 again by giving it nothing while handing @entity6 all these new powers			1
we can not go on having 59 @entity6 mps still voting on @entity2 education when neither they nor we can vote on @entity6 education			1
‘ how can they be involved in setting income tax levels which their constituents will not pay ? it is completely untenable			0
’ fellow @entity31 @entity78 reminded @entity22 that mr @entity0 had refused to allow the so - called ‘ devo max ’ option he now appears to favour to be put on the referendum ballot paper			1
mr @entity78 said the @entity19 was ‘ on the edge of a precipice ’ and warned against trying to rush through a new constitutional deal without consulting @entity2 voters			0
‘ there are a lot of people in @entity2 who already feel the @entity6 get a pretty good deal , ’ he said			1
‘ you can argue that that is fair enough – under a single currency the more peripheral areas usually get a better deal as part of the arrangements for ensuring a unified country			0
‘ but i do n’t think the @entity2 public will take kindly to the idea that devo max is being given to @entity6 funded by the rest of the @entity19 as a consolation prize for voting no. it is not tenable to simply hand over more powers to @entity6 without a wider debate			1
‘ of course the @entity2 feel left out – it has never been discussed with them			0
that can not go on			0
’ @entity109 told mps that support for devo max was not yet formal government policy , but it had ‘ been the policy of the government for some time to be open to further devolution ’			0
he said there would be ‘ immediate action ’ the day after the referendum to start drawing up new powers for @entity6 in the event of a no vote			1
formal proposals will be published next month , with draft legislation due in january			0
he said all three parties were committed to bringing forward the new laws shortly after the general election			0
@entity129 's plea : do n't turn friends and neighbours into foreigners @entity6 independence would be disastrous for the entire @entity19 and turn friends and neighbours into foreigners , sir @entity129 warned yesterday			1
in an impassioned plea to @entity6 , the former prime minister said breaking up the most successful union in history would leave both @entity2 and @entity6 ‘ immensely weaker ’			1
sir @entity30 said it was extraordinary that the potential consequences for the rest of the @entity19 had barely been debated			0
he said the @entity19 could lose its trident nuclear deterrent , which is based in @entity6 , and warned there would be major international repercussions , including the loss of the @entity19 ’s seat on the @entity148 @entity147			2
‘ i am desperately concerned , ’ he said			0
‘ we would be immensely weaker as a nation in every respect – morally , politically , in every material aspect – if @entity6 and the rest of the @entity19 were to part company			2
‘ the @entity19 would be weaker in every international body it attends			0
it would certainly be weaker in the @entity157 and in the forthcoming negotiations			0
we would almost certainly find increased demands for @entity161 independence			0
‘ suddenly @entity6 who work next to us , live next to us , are our friends , our neighbours , our workmates – suddenly become foreigners			2
is that not an extraordinary proposition for a nation that had marched together ? ‘ this year is the 100th anniversary of the @entity171			0
as we honour those who fought together , then would it not be extraordinary if the @entity174 broke up the most successful union and partnership in all history in any part of the world ? ’ sir @entity30 slammed the @entity174 for its ‘ incompetence ’ in pushing for independence without even being able to say what currency @entity6 would use			2
he said @entity6 could find themselves living in a ‘ very different country ’ , despite assurances from @entity62 that key institutions such as the pound , the @entity186 and the @entity187 would remain unchanged .			2

@entity191 and @entity15 have promised more *control* to @entity6 if they vote no
but some @entity22 have raised questions over fairness of proposed new powers
