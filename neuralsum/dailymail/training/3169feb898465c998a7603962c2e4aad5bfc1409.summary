despite his own horrific injuries @entity107 selflessly attempted to tend to his colleagues on the ground after the attack			2
following the incident , @entity107 spent a week in an induced coma , and two months in hospital			2
he then undertook intensive rehabilitation with his fellow injured @entity45 , who commented that it was @entity107 ’s optimism and sense of humour that helped them through an incredibly tough time			2
major @entity141 , who spent more than two years in rehab with @entity107 , stated : ' every single seriously injured service person goes through very dark periods and were it not for @entity107 , those dark periods would have been far longer and far harder for many to deal with , me included			0
' and it was n’t just @entity107 ’s upbeat attitude that helped his colleagues – but his love of dance too			0
previously an avid dancer - and with a degree in music and dance - @entity107 taught fellow @entity45 @entity154 , how to waltz whilst out in @entity16 , so @entity154 could impress his fiancée at their first dance for their wedding			1
when @entity107 was being airlifted to @entity159 following the incident , @entity154 said @entity107 joked : ' there go my dancing days !

she has since worked tirelessly to help and support others with @entity50 , putting aside her own health issues to help raise awareness and inspire others with the illness			1
she has worked particularly hard within the @entity179 community , where she feels that disability is often hidden away and discriminated against , as well as with young people who have been diagnosed with @entity50 trishna volunteers with several @entity50 charities , including the @entity184 , @entity179 ms and the @entity185 and in 2013 she was named ‘ @entity186 ’ at the @entity187			0
as well as fundraising , @entity36 is also editor of the @entity50 quarterly newsletter ; writes for @entity50 and disability - awareness magazines , blogs and speaks at both local events and large pharmaceutical conferences about @entity50 – something which was initially very hard for her due to her shyness and fear of public speaking			1
she is keen to put a ‘ face ’ to @entity50 , rather than being viewed as a statistic			0
hailing from @entity200 set up a @entity201 called @entity54 name : @entity53 age : 54 from : @entity200 hero qualities : founder of @entity201 , @entity54 dance partner : @entity207 twenty years ago , hairdresser and amateur - dramatics enthusiast @entity208 gathered a small group of local kids for a one - off concert in aid of charity @entity214			1

the severity of their condition meant that they were turned away from 26 local mainstream schools , as they could n’t cater for their individual needs			0
both boys were finally offered just five hours of home tuition per week			0
@entity32 decided something had to be done for her boys , and with the help of her husband @entity260 , took on the challenge of founding a school themselves			0
they relentlessly fundraised and re-mortgaged their home to raise the £ 627,000 needed , and in 1999 the @entity265 finally opened its doors in their home town			1

her kidneys stopped working , she suffered a heart attack and her breathing had to be supported			0
she was in a coma for two weeks , hospitalised for six , and underwent 15 operations			0
at one point her family were told that her chance of survival was just 30 %			0
when she woke from her coma , it was the thought of @entity296 at home that helped @entity34 to pull through , but following her release from hospital , it was n’t easy for her			0
convinced that intensive care patients and their friends and families needed greater emotional support upon recovery , @entity34 left her job and re-mortgaged her house in order to set up the charity ‘ @entity327 ’ to help to provide this support			0
since then she has been volunteering her time daily at the @entity329 at @entity330 offering what she calls , ' @entity332 ; tea , listening and compassion '			0
