' the photographer said that he does not go looking specifically for moss			2
he added : but if encountered , i 'll certainly check it out			0
the photographer said most people ignore it and pass it by , but ' after closer examination , unusual colours , patterns , shapes and forms reveal themselves ' a 100 - metre tall @entity54 spruce tree in the @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity44 , can be seen fully coated with the moss mr @entity42 , a father - of - two , said he finds moss fascinating and travels around the world capturing it in its finest light here the moss can be seen breaking through the slats of a roof ' by its nature , moss requires a certain modicum of moisture so it 's less likely to occur in drier environments , while also favouring warmer conditions			1
