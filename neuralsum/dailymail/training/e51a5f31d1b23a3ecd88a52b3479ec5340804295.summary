by @entity0 published : 09:23 est , 13 march 2013 updated : 17:54 est , 13 march 2013 a mother who posed as her 11 - year - old daughter to trap an internet predator told last night of her shock after hearing he had walked free from court			1
@entity6 , 28 , dodged jail after he admitted targeting the girl on @entity9 and sending her messages asking for ‘ naked fun ’			1
yesterday the unemployed loner said he had ‘ expected ’ to go to jail for his actions , which can carry a maximum sentence of 14 years			2
online predator : @entity6 pretended to be a 15 - year - old on his @entity9 profile , left , when he was in fact 28 , as seen outside court , right in a series of shocking messages , he posed as a local 15 - year - old boy and asked for ‘ naughty fun ’ , adding , ‘ try it you will like it ’			1
but despite knowing his intended target was only 11 , @entity6 was allowed to walk free after @entity31 recorder @entity29 said he could not be sure of his intentions			1
@entity6 is now back at his home , which is within driving distance of his victim – and yesterday his @entity9 page was still active			1
the @entity37 has campaigned for ministers to create more stringent legislation to protect youngsters online			2
the shocked mother 's youngster told her about the messages ( posed by model ) last night , the girl ’s mother hit out at the judge ’s decision to spare @entity6 from jail and said the exchange had left her feeling ‘ physically sick ’			1
she said : ‘ it ’s very disappointing that he did n’t go to prison			2
i was hoping he would be behind bars where he ca n’t be a danger to any other young girls			0
‘ i ’m surprised the judge said he was n’t sure of his intentions			0
i was the one on the receiving end of his messages and they seemed pretty clear to me			0
‘ i had everything there in black and white , all the evidence the police needed and i hoped that would result in him going to prison			2
‘ what more do they need ? do they need a child to be molested or murdered before they take action ? ’ the woman , who can not be named for legal reasons , managed to trap @entity6 when he contacted her daughter on @entity9 in december			1
the court heard how she had only allowed her daughter to use the social networking site on the condition she give her mother access to all her messages and ‘ friend ’ requests			2
posing as her daughter , the woman made it clear that she was just 11 – but @entity6 still bombarded her with perverted messages			1
the girl ’s mother was so sickened by the conversation that she called police , who were then able to track @entity6 down from his online profile			1
after his arrest , the former hotel worker of @entity97 , @entity31 , claimed he would not have taken matters further and it had just been a joke			1
@entity31 @entity101 heard how the unemployed hotel worker claimed he was 15 - years - old when he was online when officers accessed his account , it was revealed he had also contacted other young girls online			1
mr @entity107 , a former serviceman who became a lawyer in 1993 , called the behaviour ‘ bizarre ’ and ‘ disgusting ’			0
however , he said : ‘ in this case , it is not clear precisely what you were attempting to incite her to do			0
’ he sentenced @entity6 to a three - year community order after he admitted attempting to incite a child to engage in sexual activity			1
@entity6 was also put on the sex offenders ’ register for five years , ordered to undergo a treatment programme and will be banned from working with children			1
speaking to the @entity37 after the case , @entity6 said : ‘ i am sorry for what i did			2
i know i did wrong			0
i was expecting to go to jail , i ’m glad that did n’t happen			0
’ the case has alarming parallels with that of @entity128 from nearby @entity129 , @entity130 , who was 17 when she was abducted and killed by online predator @entity128			0
the girl ’s mother said it was that case that made her take the perverted messages so seriously – as she knew he had contacted other girls in the area			2
@entity9 only allows children over the age of 13 to have an account , but many youngsters get around the rules by lying about their date of birth			0
last night the mother of the 11 - year - old added : ‘ cases like these show why parents have to be so careful			1
in our family we insist on complete trust and honesty , which means there are no secrets			0
‘ i ’m so glad that i was cautious , it ’s terrifying to think what might have happened if i had not			0
‘ when my daughter asked to join @entity9 i had some reservations about it , but like many parents in that situation i did n’t want her to feel excluded from her friends who were on it			0
more should be done by the government to protect youngsters online , as it ’s really hard for parents to monitor them			0
‘ the @entity37 ’s campaign is a great idea , i give it 110 per cent of my support			0
