by @entity1 correspondent a @entity3 university is to abandon experiments on baboons in @entity6 after an undercover investigation exposed ‘ terrible suffering and cruelty ’			1
harrowing pictures revealed by the @entity16 showed the intelligent and sociable monkeys peering out of their bare wire cages , babies clinging to each other for comfort and adults having pieces of their brain removed on the operating table			1
one particularly distressing image showed a newly - caught baby baboon suckling its mother as she was given an identification tattoo at the primate research centre in @entity25			1
experiments : one of the distressing images of baboons in @entity25 revealed by the @entity16 following an undercover investigation experiments on baboons and other primates caught in the wild are banned in the @entity3 due to concerns about the suffering involved in trapping and transporting them			1
but an investigation @entity36 revealed that @entity38 scientists were flying thousands of miles to @entity25 to do work on baboons captured on the @entity6 plains			1
the lead researcher , professor @entity42 , made an impassioned defence of his quest to find vital new treatments for stroke patients			0
he also denied bypassing @entity3 law , saying the welfare concerns behind the ban did not apply to his work in @entity6 because the baboons are not endangered , are caught humanely and are only transported a short distance			1
@entity38 has announced it is to pull the research in @entity25 almost three weeks after the images came to light he said that one of his reasons for going to the @entity59 in @entity60 was to improve animal welfare standards and conditions had improved greatly during his time there			1
the use of bare , single cages is being phased out and large split - level compounds with tree ‘ climbing frames ’ are being built			2
but now , almost three weeks after the images came to light , the university has announced it is to pull the research in @entity25			2
@entity73 was one of 22,000 people to sign a petition against the experiments all other overseas projects will be reviewed			0
it is unclear what the u-turn will mean for the professor @entity42 ’s work on stroke			0
professor @entity84 , the vice-chancellor , said the baboon project began before the latest guidelines on overseas animal research were published			0
he added that @entity38 is ‘ committed to excellent standards of animal welfare ’ and to reducing the use of animals in research			2
the climbdown follows growing public support of the @entity36 ’s campaign for the taxpayer - funded experiments to be scrapped			0
two petitions attracted more than 22,000 experiments , parliamentary questions were tabled and celebrities including actress @entity73 , comedian @entity101 and wildlife presenter @entity102 joined the call for the work to be stopped			0
the @entity36 said that concern from other @entity38 researchers may also have played a role in the project being pulled			2
@entity109 , the charity ’s director of special projects , said : ‘ we welcome this move by @entity38 to stop this controversial research in @entity25			1
‘ the @entity36 investigation has caused a public outcry ; people have been shocked and repulsed by our findings and it is only right that the @entity38 should respond in this way			0
‘ it makes a mockery of @entity3 law if researchers can use public funds to go overseas to carry out horrific research on wild - caught primates that would not be allowed in the @entity3			0
