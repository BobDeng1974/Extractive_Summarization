@entity1 's mountain resorts have more snow than parts of the @entity4 and @entity5 , but skiers are being advised not to take on the slopes because of the risk of avalanches			1
the @entity10 has reported depths of 285cm at @entity12 , 250cm at @entity13 and 200cm at @entity14			1
this comes after they reported a depth of only 128cm at @entity18 in @entity19 , the host of the @entity21 , a few days ago			1
@entity23 risk : staff at @entity25 worked in sub-zero temperatures to clear the 14ft snow drifts depth : the huge amounts o snow virtually engulfed lifts on the slopes			0
@entity33 have said there is an extremely high risk of avalanches massive snow drifts in the @entity1 mountains have also caused more avalanches already than the the entirety of last winter			1
the @entity41 said the risk in @entity43 was ' high ' while the other four mountain areas the threat was ' considerable			1
' a spokesman from @entity47 said : ' further deposits of fresh unstable windslab will continue to build on the existing deep accumulations lying in sheltered areas , mainly on @entity52 to @entity54 aspects above 850 metres where avalanches will occur			0
' unstable windslab will also be present on other aspects			0
@entity58 will be unstable and prone to collapse			0
the avalanche hazard will be high			0
' the huge snowfalls have led to safety warnings being imposed by mountain rescue			0
covered : the slopes in @entity1 had more snow than some @entity66 and @entity67 ski resorts , and boasted bigger depths than the runs in @entity5 taking advantage : some skiers and snowboarders ignored the avalanche warnings at @entity74 @entity1 keen to take advantage of the conditions queue up for the lifts in @entity74 there have been 159 avalanches in the @entity1 mountains so far this winter - 80 in the last month alone - and 30 more than last season , with many more weeks of the season left			1
the number of fatalities caused by avalanches during the 2012 - 13 season was the highest in @entity88 all , eight people were killed in avalanches on @entity1 mountains last winter			1
nineteen of the 129 avalanches recorded last winter were triggered by human activity			2
heavy snowfalls , freezing temperatures and powerful winds have also created spectacular , and some potentially dangerous , conditions on @entity1 hills and mountains			2
@entity58 , edges of snow overhanging high crags , are a common feature - and risk - of most winters			2
however , this season 's frequent strong winds coupled with big dumps of snow have seen some larger than usual cornices in ranges such as the @entity111			0
a path dug by one of the workers shows how the ski lift system was buried under the blanket of snow			0

the @entity10 said there 's depths of 285cm at @entity12
a few days ago , there was only 128cm at @entity18 in @entity19
@entity41 said the risk in @entity43 was ' high '
there have already been 159 avalanches in @entity1 this winter
