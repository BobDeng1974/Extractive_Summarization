@entity1 , 63 , who has been a teacher for 40 years , left @entity15 's @entity14 in @entity16 despite being cleared by magistrates of assault			1
he was alleged to have held a seven - year - old boy by the wrists and hit him after the child flew into an ' incandescent rage ' , hitting 10 other pupils			1
the boy became ' hysterical and out of control ' during a lesson and was sent out for hitting the other children			2
one teacher described him as being in a rage and grabbed hold of railings to avoid being taken to mr @entity1 's office , screaming ' get off me , get off me '			1
once he finally got to the deputy head 's office he sat on the carpet where mr @entity1 told him to calm down			1
the same teacher then said he saw mr @entity1 hit the child and threaten to do it again if he failed to calm down			1
he told magistrates : ' mr @entity1 was not using a technique i knew , but he seemed in charge			2
he was being forceful but fair			0
' the child 's arms were flailing and he kept on shouting , getting more and more hysterical			2
mr @entity1 released or lost control of the boy 's left arm and then he struck him across the face			1
' but mr @entity1 told the hearing : ' as a teacher with over 40 years ' experience , with a good reputation within the school and local community , this allegation has come as a great shock to me and caused me and my family great distress			1
' since the boy started school he was a disruptive and aggressive pupil and frequently disrupted the school			0
he is probably the worst of the pupils i have ever taught in 40 years of teaching and on occasions he is uncontrollable			0
' whilst in year 1 it was necessary to remove him from the classroom to stop him attacking pupils			0
in class 2 as he became stronger on many occasions he attacked other pupils			0
incident : the seven - year - old boy flew into an ' incandescent rage ' at @entity15 's primary school in march last year ' it was suggested that in order to control volatile incidents the headteacher said that he should be removed to another class room			1
he was hitting children with his schoolbag and pinning another to the wall by the throat before registration			2
' the chair of @entity88 was very alarmed at his behaviour			0
' he said the boy was often sent to his office for bad behaviour and on the day of the incident had been sent out of class again for hitting other children			2
mr @entity1 added : ' we were preparing for our production of @entity99 with the eight to 10 - year - olds			1
when i got downstairs he was n't in @entity70 , he was outside @entity70 standing on the corridor shouting at the @entity70 teacher			2
' she was telling him to go inside but he was shouting " i do n't want to i 'm not going to "			0
he was shouting it very loud indeed			0
the rest of the children were looking out			0
i held his hand and he was still shouting and screaming and because i was holding his hand he was shouting " get off me "			0
' he worked himself into an incandescent rage , i knew it was all bluster and knew he would eventually calm down			1
i had to be calm but firm with him			0
' he was a bit like a long playing record " get off me , get off me " , even though i was saying " calm down "			0
i would say he said it 50 to 100 times repeating it			0
' he was throwing himself from side to side and rocking on his bottom trying to get away , trying to break free			0
he was shouting and children in the hall could hear him			0
' as well as being cleared in court of any wrongdoing , mr @entity1 has received the support of parents and other staff at the school			1
however , he was due to face a disciplinary hearing into the matter and decided to quit , leaving at the end of january			1
despite being cleared of assault he remained suspended until the hearing was over			1
he decided after ' careful deliberation ' to stand down from the Â£ 44,000 - a - year job			0
the alleged incident took place in march last year and mr @entity1 said the boy was ' the most badly behaved i have ever taught '			1
speaking of their disappointment that the school had lost such a valued member of staff , one parent said : ' mr @entity1 is an absolutely outstanding man and has dedicated his life to the school			1
' you would not find a more dedicated teacher and all the staff and parents have been 100 per cent behind him			2
for his distinguished career to end like this is a disgrace			0
' @entity153 , headteacher at @entity15 's , said : ' after careful deliberation , mr @entity1 has decided that he will not be returning to his position of deputy headteacher and has left the employment of the school with effect from 31 january , 2013			1
' parents spoke of their disappointment that the school has lost a member of staff described as ' an absolutely outstanding teacher ' who had ' dedicated his life to @entity15 's '			1
one said : ' mr @entity1 is an absolutely outstanding man and has dedicated his life to the school			1
you would not find a more dedicated teacher and all the staff and parents have been 100 per cent behind him			2
for his distinguished career to end like this is a disgrace			0
' the incident with the boy happened towards the end of classes in march last year while mr @entity1 , from @entity175 , was involved in a rehearsal with 80 pupils for a forthcoming school production of @entity99			2
at the time of mr @entity1 's acquittal mr @entity1 's son @entity179 said : ' the family have had overwhelming support over my father 's case but it should never have come to court in the first place			1
' the fact is there is an issue today with unruly children and it has come to this where dedicated teachers are repeatedly appearing before the courts on their say - so			2
