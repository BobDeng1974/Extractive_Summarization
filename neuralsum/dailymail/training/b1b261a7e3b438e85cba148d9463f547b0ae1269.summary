it 's a year since @entity1 horrified viewers on both sides of the political divide - and with another series in the pipeline , the legacy for its ' stars ' remains a mixed one			2
@entity11 ' @entity10 was the @entity14 show 's big winner , halting welfare claims after she began charging £ 1,500 an hour for nightclub gigs and appeared on celebrity big brother			1
but others fared less well after attention dwindled - including one man who was dropped by his agent and another whose deal with a millionaire entrepreneur fell through			1
reflecting on a bizarre year , her agent said : ' we approached her early on and said " you will definitely be exploited , you already have been exploited , so here 's your chance " their mixed experiences fuel the debate over whether the show 's jobless participants - whose years on benefits prompted anger , but who critics said had been exploited - ended up better or worse off than they were before			1
@entity34 , the most controversial resident of @entity28 's @entity1 , capitalised heavily on her fame - and now charges £ 1,500 for just one hour partying with students in nightclubs			1
the 43 - year - old prompted a furore early on when she was pictured partying in @entity53 after claiming sickness benefit for depression			2
but due to her earnings she no longer claims benefits , and has debated her past with everyone from @entity60 to policy experts at the @entity31			1
she was offered a reported £ 100,000 to appear on celebrity big brother - an appearance she later took up - and has become a vocal supporter of those still on the dole			2
' i have experienced some not very nice job centres , ' she told the @entity31 conference in september			0
' you do just go in , you sit down , you are looked down upon			0
well - known : @entity1 , pictured , was the unlikely star of a show dubbed ' poverty porn ' by critics the street 's residents divided viewers , with some shocked at what seemed to be a defeatist attitude to work ' they just need to understand that , just because you are on benefits does not mean that you are not a real person			1
' just because you are on benefits does n't mean that you are not physically looking for a job			2
' many of those who appeared with her on the show , however , are still looking for work despite their brief flash of fame			1
@entity92 contacted the entrepreneurs of @entity94 after he earned affectionate laughs for selling items for 50p door to door			2
@entity99 founder @entity98 stepped in to help him raise the cash for a @entity28 discount shop which would have undercut @entity102 and the 99p store			2
but the pair had a high - profile falling out last may in which mr @entity98 accused @entity106 of being ' prepared to take my help and money , but never keeps his part of the bargain '			0
it is believed mr @entity98 ' dispute was with an agent representing @entity106 , with whom he no longer works			1
mr @entity98 told @entity115 : ' @entity106 was waiting to get a job as a carer to try and save some money up to start his own business			0
as far as i know he 's out of work			1
@entity122 : @entity92 featured in the show when he went door to door selling items for 50p in business : smoggy with millionaire @entity98 - but the pair later had a high - profile falling out ' i think he 's broken away now from the people who were giving him bad advice and maybe he 's realised what went wrong			1
' he was a great guy and he certainly had some good ideas so potentially he had a lot going for him			0
he could 've ended up a millionaire			2
' mr @entity98 denied the show exploited its jobless stars or left them worse off			2
' i do n't believe it 's the show 's fault ' , he said			1
' they were n't doing anything before so if they are n't doing anything now , nothing 's changed '			2
another ' star ' who lost out was alcoholic @entity147 , who neighbours claimed was ' bribed ' with beer to appear on the show - claims @entity14 strenuously denied			1
he moved to @entity150 to escape the attention but was tracked down by agent @entity152 , who also represents @entity34 , and agreed to sign a publicity deal			1
mr @entity152 said : ' he was desperate for money , but he still looked really well			0
we met in a pub and he had just one drink and then a glass of water '			2
but the pair parted ways after he sent fungi £ 70 to apply for a passport so he could fly to @entity53			0
the agent claimed weeks went by and still there was no passport , leading him to cancel three of @entity162 's planned appearances at the holiday resort			1
the final straw , he claimed , came when @entity162 took part in a magazine interview claiming he had a girlfriend , but the woman involved later claimed she was nothing of the sort			1
others remain in limbo including @entity178 , who the street 's residents dubbed @entity181			0
she is facing trial in may after she denied charges of plotting to supply crack cocaine , diamorphine and cannabis			0
but some , including couple @entity189 and @entity190 who had never held down full - time jobs and were briefly arrested after their tv appearance , appear to be turning their life around			1
the pair refused to take part in further publicity following the show have both moved away from @entity1			1
off the radar : @entity147 was tracked to @entity150 by @entity34 's agent @entity152 , who said he looked well and signed a publicity deal with him			1
but their professional relationship quickly went downhill on the up : according to today 's report in @entity206 , @entity189 and @entity190 are off benefits ( right )			1
@entity178 ( left ) , who the street 's residents dubbed @entity181 , is facing trial over drugs claims in may according to @entity206 , @entity189 has since found a job as a labourer and the couple are no longer claiming benefits			1
' they seemed to enjoy the attention at first but i think it got too much for them , ' neighbour @entity215 , 28 , told the newspaper			0
' they left six months ago but did n't say where to '			0
another success story is @entity34 's daughter @entity226 - who is now 17 and wants a career in the police , @entity206 reported			0
she told the newspaper : ' i want to make sure i work for a living and not depend on others , because one day they might not be there for me			0
' @entity1 proved one of the most controversial tv shows of 2014 , and prompted public protests when a second series began filming in @entity237 over the summer			1
the first series was cleared of breaching broadcasting rules by the regulator @entity240 in june despite sparking more than 900 complaints			1
the show - @entity14 's most - watched in more than a year - was slammed for ' demonising ' and ' misrepresenting ' those on the breadline , prompting @entity244 debates and local meetings			2
the vast majority of complaints - 887 - were about the way those on benefits were portrayed and fears it was being used as ' poverty porn '			1
some 23 viewers also raised fears about children and young people featured in the show , and the care which was given by programme makers for their welfare and dignity			0
but @entity240 ruled the show was clearly a portrayal of one street and not wider society			0
reflecting on his clients ' unusual year , mr @entity152 told @entity115 : ' in everybody 's defence in the street , they never applied to go on this			0
it was n't @entity271 or a talent show or @entity273			0
' none of them had any of these aspirations whatsoever but these opportunities came down the street once it became famous			0
i think even @entity34 is still bemused			0
' i guess @entity34 was fortunate			0
we approached her early on and said " you will definitely be exploited , you already have been exploited , so here 's your chance "			2
' she could have let it disappear , and many on the street have done that			0
i offered @entity189 work in the beginning in @entity53 and he was n't interested in doing anything			1
' when people ask if it 's ethically messed up , i think society is messed up			0
in the digital age the sort of thing that used to just be gossip down the pub is now a national talking point			0
all i can do as a businessman is say " there is a value here "			0

@entity305 show last *january* prompted horror and 900 ' poverty porn ' complaints
' @entity310 now charges £ 1,500 an hour for nightclub appearances
but others have been less fortunate after public 's attention dwindled
' @entity317 ' lost out on chance to open 50p store backed by millionaire
' @entity162 ' moved to @entity150 , cut down on drink but was dropped by agent
@entity189 , however , is said to be in work and no longer on benefits
