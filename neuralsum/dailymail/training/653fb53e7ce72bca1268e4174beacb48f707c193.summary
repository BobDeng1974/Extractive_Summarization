tick , tock the wait goes on for @entity1			1
much like his career since @entity6 spent all that money , the transfer window that promised something is passing by			1
@entity10 and @entity11 both want to invest in a shadow , but evidently not enough to meet @entity6 ’s valuation and @entity1 ’ expectations for wages			1
in the circumstances , both seem high			2
it has passed the point of becoming a dark comedy , this decline of one of the best strikers to play in the @entity24			0
loss of form is one thing , @entity29 ’s suggestion last season that he was n’t a ‘ real striker ’ quite another			2
public humiliation by virtue of his performances , cutting words from his manager			0
face buried in the turf , a replay of an astonishing miss on loop and soon to be viral			0
@entity63 , a prolific 16 - year - old striker from the academy , has head in hands as he processes what he ’s just seen			2
in their report of @entity6 ’s 2 - 1 win over @entity72 on sunday , the club ’s official website described the preceding moment			1
it read : ‘ excellent work down the left from the overlapping @entity80 created an easy opening for @entity82 but , close to the goal - line , he could only chest his effort up and over the bar			2
’ it was an accurate review , but kind for the understandable compassion - he is a @entity6 player and the owner ’s indulgence			1
but it was a dreadful , incomprehensible miss , worse than the open goal he failed to find after rounding @entity92 at @entity93 in september 2011			1
that terrible miscue came after he had timed a run between two centre halves and fooled the goalkeeper with a stepover			0
that such a miss happened on the afternoon he scored his first of the season only serves to suggest this union between man and club was cursed from the start			0
easy target : @entity1 missed another sitter for @entity6 , and was subject to criticism on social media cross : @entity80 put the ball on a plate for @entity1 inside the six yard box unorthodox : @entity1 then attempted to chest the ball into the goal from two yards not again : the ball went flying over the bar as @entity1 slumped to the floor in despair three years on , having contributed a bit ( his goal away at @entity125 in 2012 was a wonderful moment ) and blushed a lot , his miss in @entity122 was worse			1
it was two yards out			2
opting to use his chest at that height was a bizarre ; that he could get it over the bar with any body part from so close almost impressive			0
what has happened to him ? there are always explanations with @entity1			1
it ’s the confidence thing , or the injuries and what they have done to his acceleration			0
truth in all , no doubt			0
but whatever storm is going on in his mind and body , the sights are uncomfortable , not least because in the passage of three - and - a - half years some , regrettably , might just have forgotten what a good player he was			0
huge highlight : @entity1 rounds @entity154 in the @entity155 to score the goal that sealed a famous win written in the stars : @entity1 ' goal that sealed @entity6 's passage to the @entity56 final was special @entity162 returns to @entity6 raw emotion : @entity164 and @entity1 embrace on the pitch after @entity6 's @entity56 triumph @entity63 was nine at the start of the 2007 - 08 season , when @entity1 scored 33 goals in 46 games and was voted the third best player in the world			1
it is a pleasant irony , a happy compensation for the player , that in his weakest years as a professional he has added the @entity177 , @entity56 , @entity55 and @entity57 to the @entity178 and @entity177 he ’d already won			1
silverware winner : @entity1 played a key role in @entity6 's @entity57 win including a goal in the final @entity184 selection : @entity185 and @entity1 hold the @entity55 , one of three major club honours the 30 - year - old striker has picked up during his mixed spell at @entity190 they go a hefty way to offsetting the statistics , most notably those for @entity24 fixtures , that show he has scored 20 in 110 games for @entity6			1
the numbers are what tend to kill a striker , the anecdotes depict how gruesome it was			2
for @entity82 , so lethal at his best , it has been fairly grisly			0
now , surely , is the time for him to move on			0
@entity6 are committed to his £ 9million - a - year wages for two more seasons and they want a transfer fee in the region of £ 20m			1
it is an ambitious pricing			0
rival : @entity212 rival : @entity164 rival : @entity1 rival : @entity216 you 're the one that we want : any potential buyer for @entity1 will hope for his @entity222 incarnation replacement ? @entity212 scored in @entity6 's 2 - 1 friendly win after being picked ahead of @entity1 @entity212 has come in and so has @entity164			1
@entity29 admires @entity212 and adores @entity164			0
what place can there be for a £ 50m signing , not regarded as a ‘ real striker ’ and whose security net - @entity229 ’s affection - has apparently disappeared ? his position could be complicated further by @entity216 playing a fuller role at the club , should his price prove too expensive @entity236			1
then what for the 30 - year - old ? one can only hope that @entity10 , @entity11 or someone else stump up or @entity6 and @entity1 lower their respective bars			1
he might then be able to find – and sustain – some form			0
the man who has won almost everything needs it badly			0
only the heartless would begrudge him that			0
begging for a fresh chance : the once - prolific striker pleads with @entity249 after missing a great chance at the @entity178 in @entity252 's 5 - 1 group stage thrashing by @entity253 high among the lows : torres did score for @entity252 at the @entity178 but his country crashed out in the group			2

£ *50million* forward still ca *n't* seem to get a break at @entity190
he *blazed* over from two yards in front of an open goal during a friendly
he has won the @entity56 , @entity55 and @entity57 at @entity6
but striker is a shadow of the *brilliant* *goalscorer* seen at @entity222
interest of @entity10 and @entity11 needs to come through for @entity1
but transfer fee and his wage demands are too high for the main *suitors*
