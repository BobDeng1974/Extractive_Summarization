by @entity0 published : 21:14 est , 10 july 2013 updated : 19:40 est , 11 july 2013 silly : education secretary @entity1 dismissed @entity3 's pay rise idea the quango chief promising mps a £ 7,600 pay rise faced a furious public and political backlash yesterday – with one cabinet minister telling him to ‘ stick it ’			1
sir @entity11 was lambasted by voters during a radio phone - in after confirming plans to give mps an 11 per cent pay rise , and suggesting it was a ‘ very good deal ’ for the taxpayer			1
callers to @entity22 ’s @entity21 show branded the proposals ‘ obscene ’ and ‘ outrageous ’ , and asked sir @entity11 : ‘ what planet are you living on ? ’ sir @entity11 , chairman of the @entity27 ( @entity3 ) , also came under fire from leading politicians			1
asked whether the increase should go ahead , education secretary @entity1 said : ‘ absolutely not			2
mps are incredibly well paid at the moment anyway , as are ministers			0
' ipsa is a bit of a silly organisation anyway			0
pay rise ? they can stick it			1
’ @entity39 , who will refuse the rise , said the proposal was not ‘ remotely justifiable ’ at a time when public sector wage increases were capped at 1 per cent			1
@entity44 put pressure on @entity46 by saying he too would refuse the rise			0
@entity48 refused to say whether the prime minister would take the pay increase , but said he thought @entity31 ’ pay ‘ should not be going up while public sector pay is being constrained ’			2
@entity3 wants to introduce the pay rise , along with a package of cuts to mps ’ pensions and perks , after the 2015 election			1
but there were growing indications last night that it could be delayed until at least 2016 , when the public sector wage cap is due to end			0
a government source said party leaders were likely to order mps to refuse the rise if it is brought in before 2016			2
‘ hopefully @entity3 will see sense and either abandon this proposal or at least delay it , ’ the source said			0
‘ if they do n’t , you will see the parties lay down the law to mps that they can not take it while pay restraint in the public sector is continuing			2
’ trade unions reacted angrily to the proposal , and warned a wave of industrial action could follow if mps were handed an 11 per cent rise			1
@entity85 general - secretary @entity84 said : ‘ if inflation - busting pay increases are good enough for the political class then they are good enough for nurses , transport workers , firefighters and the rest of the working class			2
’ the rise would leave @entity31 three times richer than the average person in @entity97 the proposals would see @entity31 ’ basic pay rise from £ 66,396 to £ 74,000			1
but they would also have their gold - plated pensions cut back , see reductions to their controversial ‘ golden handshake ’ payments , and lose perks such as free tv licences			1
these cuts will partially offset the cost of the pay rise , leaving taxpayers with a total extra bill of £ 500,000			1
mps would also be paid to produce an ‘ annual report ’ on their activities to help ‘ inform ’ voters about their jobs			0
critics said the reports were likely to be taxpayer - funded ‘ puff pieces ’			0
sir @entity11 , who is paid £ 700 a day to advise on mps ’ expenses , said it was time to allow their pay to ‘ catch up ’ after years of being suppressed			1
@entity3 said the £ 74,000 was at the ‘ lower end ’ of what it thought @entity31 deserved to be paid			1
its review had concluded mps might deserve as much as £ 83,430 but decided to recommend the lower amount because of the ‘ current difficult circumstances ’			2
an @entity3 survey found that two - thirds of mps believe they are underpaid			2
@entity137 mp @entity136 said politics would struggle to attract high - calibre people unless mps were given a major pay hike			1
he added : ‘ mps are paid about the same as a junior school headmistress or headmaster			0
i ’ve got lots and lots of those in my constituency , there is only one mp			0
‘ it is public service			0
we expect that we are not going to earn the money that we could have earned in the private sector but there has to be some balance in there			0
’ many mps have attacked @entity3 for being bureaucratic and costly			0
@entity137 @entity159 said the pay proposal underlined the case for the quango to be scrapped			0
he added : ‘ faced with a choice between taking a pay hike , or taking the axe to @entity3 , i would vote to scrap @entity3 every time			0
’ @entity46 has previously called a large rise ' unthinkable ' while @entity39 said he would not accept one			1

@entity27 will take pay to £ 74,000
the 11 *%* increase offset by reduction in perks like ' gold - plated pensions '
end to golden *goodbyes* for mps who stand down and dinner *allowances*
@entity39 and @entity180 say they will not take pay rise
