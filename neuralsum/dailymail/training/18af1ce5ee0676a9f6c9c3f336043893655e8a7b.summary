by @entity0 published : 08:52 est , 5 july 2013 updated : 10:12 est , 5 july 2013 angrily thwacking the ketchup bottle to coax out the stubborn sauce could soon be a distant memory , after scientists invented an edible non-stick coating			2
applying just a thin layer of the tasteless substance – known as @entity8 - to the inside of the bottle creates a slippery surface allowing the contents to slide straight out			1
the non-toxic lubricant can be used on both plastic and glass containers to ensure that consumers can enjoy every last drop of not only their favourite tomato sauce , but other sticky condiments as well , such as mustard and mayonnaise			1
according to the inventors , each year an estimated one million tonnes of condiments are thrown away globally because leftovers can not be scraped from jars and bottles , with up to 15 per cent of a product remaining in its container			1
each year an estimated one million tonnes of condiments are thrown away globally because leftovers can not be scraped from jars and bottles they also claim that eliminating safety caps on squeeze bottles could save 50,000 tons of plastic a year			1
not only does the product save waste and reduce the need for packaging , but it could stop your beer or cola going flat			0
the smoother surface created by coating the inside of cans and bottles for carbonated drinks with the substance , slows the release of carbon dioxide bubbles from a drink , keeping it fizzy for longer			1
the first consumer product with @entity8 coating is expected to hit supermarket shelves by next year			1
