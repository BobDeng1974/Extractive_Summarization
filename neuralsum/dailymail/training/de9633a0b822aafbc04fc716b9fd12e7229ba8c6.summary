' it 's changing all the time , ' says photographer @entity2			2
' i tell myself not to be nostalgic because i have to record @entity5 's state of flux and because yesterday is kind of irrelevant			2
' after almost 40 years of photographing @entity5 , @entity2 is explaining why the dark continent continues to fascinate			1
born and raised in @entity7 , he 's spent decades charting the changing circumstances of @entity5 's people , whether @entity14 pastoralists or @entity12 's @entity11 hunter - gatherers			1
just how rapidly life is changing for @entity5 's traditional peoples is made clear in a new @entity18 documentary which follows @entity2 as he searches for five @entity14 women he first photographed 30 years ago in northern @entity7			1
tradition : @entity14 tribespeople @entity21 , @entity23 , @entity24 and @entity25 photographed by @entity2 during a visit to their @entity7 homeland in 2010 creative : @entity29 ( left ) and @entity30 ( right ) show off their elaborate @entity14 jewellery in this pair of portraits taken in northern @entity7 in 2010 town : establishments such as this restaurant are encouraging people to swap traditional lifestyles for modern , urban dwellings once a nomadic people , the women he rediscovers have become sedentary , with one , @entity44 , found living just two miles from where she was first photographed and claiming to have travelled no more than 12 miles in her entire life			1
' life for them has changed a lot , ' explains @entity2			2
' a lot of @entity14 have become sedentary , which does mean good things such as being able to send their kids to school , having access to healthcare , water and things like that			2
' it 's not my role to bemoan the passing of an era but i do think tradition is very important in people 's lives			0
' during his journey through @entity14 tribal land , a vast region that covers 8,000 square miles and includes the @entity74 , it becomes clear that many of the traditional ways do remain , even among @entity14 who have left the tribal homeland to pursue careers in @entity79 and other large cities			2
cattle camp : the @entity82 , a @entity84 people , live 75km from the capital @entity86 and rely on their animals to survive danger : the @entity82 , who rely on spears and bows and arrows to defend themselves , are at risk of being caught in @entity84 's latest conflict pastoralist : the @entity97 people of @entity7 and @entity98 , such as this man photographed in 1990 , are famous for their elaborate basket weaving and for raising camels tradition : a group of @entity104 initiates photographed in @entity12 in 2012 with their faces embellished with patterns created using traditional chalk face - paint love : an elderly @entity14 woman kisses her grandchild in a photograph taken by @entity2 during a visit to the country in 1993 like their neighbours , the @entity116 , the lives of the @entity82 tribe of @entity84 revolve around their cattle			1
famous for their bright red locks , achieved by using cattle urine as hair bleach , the tribe are semi-nomadic and spend their lives wandering the open plains of @entity126 province			1
still clinging to tradition , the main threat to their existence is the civil war currently raging that has pitted their @entity116 neighbours against another @entity84 tribe - the @entity135			1
' they are incredibly resilient and proud people who have held out [ against modernisation ] , ' adds @entity2			0
' the [ neighbouring ] @entity104 have moved much closer to everyone else but because the @entity14 are further away from the big cities , they 've retained their customs a little bit longer			0
' but while the @entity14 form the backbone of @entity2 's latest @entity5 venture , they 're by no means the only people he meets during a journey that takes him into one of the continent 's newest - and least stable - nations , @entity84			1
here , he photographs the @entity82 people , a tribe of spear - wielding nomadic pastorialists whose life , unlike the @entity14 , has changed little over the centuries			1
for them , the main threat to their way of life comes not from encroaching technology but from war			0
' it was very lucky - we just got in and out in the nick of time , ' explains @entity2 of his trip to @entity84 , a country currently convulsed by a vicious civil war that began last december			1
' based on intelligence on the ground , we knew we only had a blip of peace before the whole thing unravelled again			0
' and it 's not the first time he 's faced conflict while in pursuit of the perfect picture , although he says it 's a risk that can be minimised by keeping a weather eye on the situation on the ground			0
' the main risks , on the whole , are that you can be targeted for some money or caught in the crossfire , ' he explains			0
' i was apprehensive [ about going into @entity84 ] but literally you go along and if all 's clear you carry on , while keeping an eye on the information that comes to you on the ground			0
staying safe : @entity196 couple @entity195 and @entity197 pose with an assault rifle in 2010 , while @entity199 , a @entity82 man from @entity84 , has a homemade bow and arrow colourful : this woman , photographed in @entity204 in 2008 , is a member of the @entity206 tribe , @entity204 's largest ethnic group modern : @entity208 and @entity209 , photographed in eastern @entity7 in 2001 , combine modern conveniences such as radios with traditional clothes ' on the whole , people are immensely hospitable , ' he adds			1
' but i have had situations in past where i 've been arrested or passport taken away by suspicious officials			0
i shoot on film so sometimes , people think you 're a spy when they ca n't see the pictures ! ' despite the dangers , @entity2 says his @entity5 journey will continue for as long as there are still people to photograph and new places to explore			1
' it 's the people you meet , ' he says of the pleasures of @entity5 travel			0
' it 's the hospitality and spending time with people who have very little and are living in the moment and are grateful just to spend time with you - just sharing a laugh with people			0
' that side of the adventure becomes clear during an encounter with the @entity11 hunter - gathers , whom @entity2 joins for a successful baboon hunt			1
asked by @entity2 whether he would ever live in a town , @entity250 , a tribal elder , replies : ' no , it 's too dangerous ! next they 'll make us pay taxes ! bad ! ' sentiments with which many of us would no doubt agree			0
hook , meanwhile , plans to continue ' there are 48 countries in @entity5 and i 've only been to 25			0
in a way , that 's the danger of calling [ the documentary ] photographing @entity5			2
it 's an ongoing process and there 's still much more to do			0
' photographing @entity5 , tonight at 9pm on @entity18			2
