snout - nosed crocodiles with jaws strong enough to crush clam shells ruled the swampy wetlands that covered @entity5 13 million years ago			1
palaeontologists have discovered the remains of seven different species of crocodile and cayman , including three new species , in the area around the modern @entity13			1
the fossils were found in the @entity16 district of northern @entity5			1
the new species of caymen @entity18 ( shown in the reconstruction above ) had a short but wide jaw that was powerful enough to crush clams and other shell fish			1
it used its snout to dig in the mud one of the new species , named @entity27 , had blunt , peg - like teeth and used its broad snout to dig shellfish from the muddy swamp floor			1
it grew up to 5.2ft ( 1.6 metres ) in length and had just 11 teeth			0
most cayman , which are related to alligators , tend to have around 20 teeth			0
prehistoric crocodiles escaped the jaws of predatory dinosaurs by running like dogs , according to a study published last year			0
the findings explain how the reptiles evolved in a dinosaur dominated world			0
while most modern crocodiles live in freshwater habitats and feed on mammals and fish , their ancestors ran around on land like dogs while others adapted to life in the open ocean , imitating the behaviour of whales			0
the study , by @entity62 , revealed how the jaws of the ancient crocodiles evolved to enable the fierce animals to survive in vastly different environments			0
the team examined variation in the shape and biomechanics function of the lower jaws in over 100 ancient crocodiles during the @entity75 - a period which began 251 million years ago and covered over 170 million years			1
the study revealed that ancient crocodiles invaded the @entity79 seas and evolved jaws built primarily for water efficiency to capture agile prey , such as fish			0
after the devastating extinction that ended the @entity86 period , crocodile ancestors invaded the seas and evolved jaws primarily built to efficiently swim in the water to catch agile prey such as fish			2
they also evolved a great variety of lower jaw shapes during the @entity95 - about 145 million to 65 million years ago - as they adapted to a diverse range of niches and environments alongside the dinosaurs , including eating plants			1
instead , the fossil record points towards novel adaptations in other areas of their anatomy , such as armadillo - like body armour			0
another blunt nosed crocodile was named @entity108 , which means ' grinding or crushing machine '			2
the scientists estimate it grew up to 6.2ft ( 1.9 metres ) in length			0
however , these new species were dwarved by two other previously known species of giant cayman whose fossils were also found nearby			2
@entity118 and @entity119 are thought to have grown up to 39ft ( 12 metres ) in length and were more generalised predators			0
the researchers say that it is highly unusual to have found a habitat that had so many species of cayman living alongside each other			0
there are six cayman species that live in the whole of the @entity131 today , but only three are ever found in the same area and they rarely share the same habitat			2
the large number of cayman found in @entity16 has been described by the researchers leading the excavation as ' hyperdiverse '			1
dr @entity139 , from the @entity140 in @entity141 , said the huge wetland habitat that covered the area led to an explosion in the number of crocodile species			1
he said : ' we have uncovered this special momen in time when the ancient mega-wetaland ecosystem reached its peak in size and complexity , just before its demise and the start of the modern @entity13 system			0
' at this moment , most known cayman groups co-existed			0
' @entity159 lineages bearing unusual blunt snouts and globular teeth along with those more generalised feeders representing the beginning of what was to come			0
' the fossils may now help scientists unravel the evolutionary origins of cayman that live in the @entity131			2
they describe the discovery in a paper published in the journal @entity171 scientists found fossilised remains of seven ancient caymen species in @entity16 , northern @entity5 , shown above the fossilised skulls shown above belong to the three new snout nosed caymen species @entity18 ( a ) @entity108 ( b ) and the much larger @entity179 ( c ) the @entity181 pebasensis name is derived from ' @entity182 ' , which is @entity183 for ' small nose ' , along with the name of the village where it was found , @entity16 , and the @entity188 for crocodile - @entity189			1
the animal , which is new to science , is thought to have used its snout as a shovel in to search for shellfish in the muddy depths of the swamps			2
dr @entity139 said : ' when we analysed @entity181 bones and realised that it was probably a head - burrowing and shovelling caiman preying on mollusks living in muddy river and swamp bottoms , we knew it was a milestone for understanding proto - @entity13 wetland feeding dynamics			2
' the scientists also describe a third new species of prehistoric caymen called @entity179 , which they estimate grew up to 7ft ( 2.2 metres ) long			1
it is thought to have resembled the broad - snouted caymen that lives in fresh water marshes and swamps thought out central and eastern @entity215			1
@entity179 , one of the new species , resembled the broad snouted caymen pictured above			1

scientists discovered seven species of caymen in @entity16 , northern @entity222
the area at the time *13m* years ago was covered in a huge swampy wetland
the fossils show the area supported a ' hyperdiverse ' crocodile *population*
three of the fossils discovered are new species of broad - snouted caymen
one had a shovel - shaped snout and peg - like teeth for crushing shell fish
