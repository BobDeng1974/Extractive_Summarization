all @entity1 veteran @entity0 had a @entity3 moment when quizzed on the injury crisis that has decimated @entity6 's pack ahead of saturday 's autumn international opener at @entity8			1
@entity0 's team - mate @entity3 famously could not name a single @entity6 player when asked to during last summer 's tour of @entity1 , and while @entity0 's faux pas was not quite of the same proportion , it may be perceived as another example of @entity17 indifference towards @entity6			1
asked if the @entity1 would look to take advantage of @entity6 's problems up front , a puzzled @entity0 admitted : ' to be honest i 'm not too sure on who 's injured at the moment			1
' @entity1 hooker @entity0 talks to the media after @entity1 arrived in @entity6 on monday @entity1 captain @entity24 and head coach @entity25 arrive at their team hotel on monday @entity29 lock @entity28 became the latest @entity6 player to be ruled out the series with a neck injury when told @entity6 had seven regular forwards out - @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity28 , @entity37 , @entity38 and @entity39 - the 121 - cap hooker , 35 , backtracked somewhat			1
' they 're pretty lucky up here , ' added			0
' they have always had a good forward pack up here , so we 're expecting no matter who is on the field it is going to be an @entity49 calibre forward pack			0
' whether or not talismanic fly half @entity52 starts on saturday was the burning question for the assembled @entity17 press - who were also unaware of @entity6 's injury problems - on monday			1
@entity52 came off the bench to feature in saturday 's 12 - try demolition of the @entity59 in @entity60			1
it was his first appearance since injuring his leg in the @entity64 final back in july			0
@entity52 's last game before the weekend was for the @entity66 in july assistant coach @entity67 said : ' @entity36 came through really well			2
he had a smile on his face afterwards and the signs are really , really positive			0
' asked if he and head coach @entity25 had seen enough to convince them @entity52 was ready to start ahead of @entity73 , @entity67 added : â€˜ it was a good first step for him and we 're delighted with that			2
' i thought he looked half a yard off the pace early on but i think we started to see him get back in to the right sort of tempo as the game finished			0
we 'll make an assessment when it 's time this week			0
' wing @entity86 and hooker @entity87 have flown home from the tour after suffering hamstring and ankle injuries respectively against the @entity59			2
