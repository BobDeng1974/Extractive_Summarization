a @entity1 woman who woke up to a horrendous smell and suspicious brown splodges on her home and car , has blamed passing airlines for the mess			1
@entity8 , from @entity9 in @entity10 , told the @entity11 that she was sure the ' huge clumps ' , that she also found on the footpath near her house , were human faeces			1
' the first thing when i walked out of my door this morning and i saw it , i thought an airplane s * * * on us			0
you open the door and it smells like s * * * , ' she said			0
' there 's no way it 's a bird or animal poo , it 's horrible			0
i 'm sure it 's human , what else could it be with huge clumps like that ? ' ms @entity8 told the @entity11			2
despite not being the first @entity1 citizen to suggest a passing air - plane offloaded human waste above their home , both @entity55 and the country 's @entity56 deny having record of any incidents			2
@entity61 safety consultant , @entity60 , also expressed doubt over a plane 's involvement and suggested ms @entity8 ' incident was more likely caused by ' bad neighbours '			1
ms @entity8 ' house is in the direct flight path to @entity36 ( pictured ) ' it 's certainly not coming from an aircraft because maintenance standards are extremely high today , ' mr @entity60 told @entity72			1
he explained that the waste in a plane goes from the toilet into a sewage tank which is emptied out periodically in a highly controlled environment by specialised trucks carrying large hoses and tanks â€“ often after every second trip			0
the fittings for the tank are on the outside of the aircraft and thus only accessible by ground handling staff , meaning a spontaneous mid-air release is difficult to control			0
airline safety consultant , @entity60 , said it was ' impossible ' that the excrement came from a plane as maintenance standards are extremely high , with trucks collecting the sewage after every second flight ' there 's nothing that comes out of a plane unless there 's something wrong with it , ' the former pilot assured			1
' modern planes use a vacuum system , so the chances of a leak are extremely remote and it would be spotted on the ground before an aircraft departed because the engineers and pilots do a thorough walk around the aircraft before take - off to check on these sorts of things			2
' it 's just another urban myth			0

@entity8 says she woke up to faeces covering her home and car
the @entity10 woman is *convinced* the ' huge clumps ' are human excrement that fell from a passing airplane
airline safety consultant , @entity60 , said it was unlikely a plane *illegally* *dumped* its sewage while in the air
he said the maintenance standards on airlines are extremely high and a leak would have been noticed before take - off
