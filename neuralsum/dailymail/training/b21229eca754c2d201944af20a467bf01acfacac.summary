by @entity0 being granted big , shiny accolades can be a double - edged sword in a town as demanding as @entity4			0
the beautiful @entity5 in the city 's @entity7 area has been billed as ' the best hotel in @entity4 ' for several years running and its restaurants are regularly hailed as some of the @entity16 's finest , so our expectations were understandably high as we arrived at the restaurant			1
one of two eateries at the hotel , the restaurant has recently undergone a major menu overhaul with executive head chef @entity19 now overseeing an entirely @entity21 offering after years of the place being known as a the hottest pan-asian destination on @entity7			1
the beautiful @entity5 in the city 's @entity7 area has been billed as ' the best hotel in @entity4 ' for several years running its restaurants are regularly hailed as some of the @entity16 's finest , so our expectations were understandably high as we arrived at the restaurant it was a risk taken to appeal to the tribes of monied @entity30 now holidaying in the @entity32 beach town			1
and while the seasonal @entity34 menu is a bit at odds with the @entity38 decor and ambience the food is fabulous enough to pull off this delicious global mash up			1
the restaurant is just minutes away from the neon margarita bars of @entity43 , but elegant design touches like the mother - of - pearl bar and @entity47 screens imported from @entity48 lend the place a serene and grown - up atmosphere while the dark wood and red lighting throughout keeps things sexy enough for date night			2
touches like the mother - of - pearl bar and @entity47 screens imported from @entity48 lend the place a serene and grown - up atmosphere after settling in with a signature @entity60 cocktail ( the best cocktails here still have an @entity38 flavour ) my date and i were taken through a menu that was more @entity65 than @entity7 , complete with fresh black and white truffles all the way from @entity68 ( the smell was so good we forgot to worry about the carbon footprint )			1
i had mentioned that my better half was a vegetarian when booking and staff at the @entity75 were prepared with menu recommendations and a specially made amuse - bouche			2
the menu follows a traditional @entity80 format : primi , pasta , secondi and - of course - dessert , and questions about all dishes are encouraged as diners watch the chefs prepare everything around a gleaming @entity90 grill			0
to start , for him , a plate of local heirloom tomatoes and figs was packed with flavour and finished with a perfectly sticky balsamic glaze			0
for me , as the non-veggie , it was my duty to try the duck foie - gras which came with crushed @entity102 biscuits and was decadent and delicious			2
being bad euros we skipped the secondi instead doubling up on truffle for our pasta dishes choosing the truffle risotto , with extra white truffle , and the fragola and pancetta pasta , with extra white truffle ( this is entirely allowed when holiday dining )			2
a punchy passion fruit soufflé with fresh coconut ice team came next ( homemade ice cream and sorbet flavours change daily ) and we finished the meal with another chilli - infused cocktail			0
our only gripe was the music , which was too loud and too ' eurotrash ' for such an elegant setting			0
but this is @entity4 , where ear bleeding ' doof doof ' to accompany a few hundred dollar dinner bill is the norm so instead of moaning we toasted the dj with another @entity60 as we tried to soak up the romance of the hotel 's stylish outdoor pools			0
and then another one as we passed the bar on the way home			0
