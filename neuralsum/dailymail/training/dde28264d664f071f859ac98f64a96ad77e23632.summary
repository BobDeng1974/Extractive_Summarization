by @entity0 for a good ten years now , coffee has been @entity3 ’s new obsession – with high street chains popping up everywhere to challenge our image as a nation of tea drinkers			0
but the new brand of caffeine launched by a major tourist attraction may be a step too far for even the most latté - obsessed fans of hot beverages			0
not necessarily everyone 's cup of coffee : you may need a strong stomach to try the @entity20 @entity21 – an enclave of spooky corridors and shock - tactic exhibits which looks at the darker side of the history of the capital city – is celebrating the opening of its @entity28 , and with it , the chance for guests to enjoy a nice mug of ‘ @entity33 ’			1
the concept has been dreamed up in response to the current @entity37 craze for ‘ @entity38 ’ – where customers sip lunchtime drinks in the company of resident felines			0
mixed reception : some guests at the cafe seemed pleased to meet the ' locals ' - others seemed less sure this @entity21 version , as you might have guessed , involves not purring moggies but scampering , twitching – and very real – rodents			1
brave souls can also opt to eat at the café – where , if they can stomach the bad pun as much as the very idea of it – they can try @entity57			0
@entity58 and safety officials will be relieved to hear that neither food nor drink at the @entity28 includes rats as genuine ingredients – but willing guests can , if they so choose , enjoy both while the little creatures dash about the room , or even sit on their shoulders			1
pleased to meet you : cafe customers cosy up to the @entity21 rats , and even find time for a selfie although this unusual form of catering is largely for fun , there is also a mildly serious point to it – an attempt to rehabilitate the image of a much - maligned creature			1
‘ rats have been tarnished with an undeserved reputation throughout history – from the @entity84 of the @entity85 to the great stink of @entity87 , ’ says @entity80 of @entity21			1
up close and personal : customers were able to handle the much - maligned rodents as they sipped ' @entity90 ' ‘ we wanted to challenge those perceptions and show they are actually characterful and full of fun			2
’ eighteen rats were unleashed on café guests – all of whom have rodent day jobs at the @entity21 , and have been vetted to mingle with the public			1
‘ we have 18 rodents living here , and they are a huge hit with our guests , who get to see them close up in their special display , with giant viewing windows , ’ mr @entity80 adds			0
a surprise success : although the @entity20 was a one - off special , @entity21 may make it a regular event ‘ our café takes that a step further , and lets people get even closer , handle them , stroke them and really get to know them			2
’ although the @entity28 was a one - off for a group of rat - loving guests , @entity21 is considering making the idea a regular event			2
‘ judging by first reactions , this pop - up rat café could become a regular date on the eccentric things to do calendar , ’ mr @entity80 says .			0

@entity21 creates *quirky* cafe where customers can drink with rats
guests are able to handle the ' *misunderstood* ' rodents as they enjoy a coffee
