by @entity0 someone has run up the white flag on one of @entity5 's most famous landmarks			0
commuters on tuesday morning were greeted with a pair of billowing white banners atop the @entity9 after vandals stole @entity11 and replaced them with ones that had been bleached			1
the flags appeared to have faint traces of stars and stripes on it			0
it was revealed this afternoon that the flags were defaced by vandals who bleached them			2
the vandals tacked aluminum covers on to the lights that illuminated that flags , so that the top of the bridge towers looked dark			1
as a result , the white flags were not discovered until daybreak			1
@entity32 video of the bridge shows that the first tower went dark about 3.35am			1
the second tower went dark seven minutes later , indicating the heist was at least a two - person job			0
officials called it a major security breach so far , the @entity57 has no clue who is behind the flags or why they were hoisted above the bridge - though they do n't believe it has any connection to terrorism or politics			2
' this may be somebody 's art project , or it may be an attempt at a statement , ' @entity66 , deputy commissioner of intelligence of the @entity57 , said this afternoon			0
several officers scaled the bridge and were seen lowering the flag on the @entity76 side around 11am as traffic inched along the bridge			2
the bridge is one of the most heavily secured landmarks in the city , constantly monitored by surveillance cameras			1
police patrol cars are also stationed at both ends of the bridge			2
detectives are reviewing security footage in an attempt to determine who put up the white flags - and how they gained access to the span			1
the support towers are 273 - feet tall and it 's unknown how the thieves managed to climb them without anyone noticing			2
@entity100 president @entity99 blasted the vandals who took the @entity48 flags			0
the @entity76 side of the bridge blinked out at 3.35am as a vandal covered the lights illuminating the @entity48 flag by 3.42am , the lights above both towers on the @entity9 were out by 11am , @entity57 officers had taken down the white flags			1
they were later replaced with new @entity48 flags they promptly hoisted up an @entity48 flag - atop the bridge - replacing the @entity11 that was stolen from the @entity5 icon it 's unclear how the vandals slipped past the police officers and security cameras guarding the bridge ' if flying a white flag atop the @entity9 is someone ’s idea of a joke , i ’m not laughing , ' he told the @entity128			1
' the public safety of our city is of paramount importance , particularly our landmarks and bridges that are already known to be high - risk targets			0
we will not surrender our public safety to anyone , at any time			0
' in april , @entity5 artist @entity139 - aka @entity138 - scaled the @entity141 - @entity140 and planted an art installation at the top			0
he was later arrested and charged with reckless endangerment and criminal trespass .			0

vandals managed to slip *unnoticed* past police officers and surveillance cameras guarding the @entity9 early tuesday and install white flags
they *boarded* up the lights illuminating the flags so that nobody noticed the white banners until daybreak
@entity32 video of the bridge shows the lights above the towers went out at 3.35am and 3.42am
no hint yet who is *responsible* for the vandalism
