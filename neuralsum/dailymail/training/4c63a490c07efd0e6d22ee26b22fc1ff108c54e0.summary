published : 11:33 est , 5 march 2013 updated : 11:33 est , 5 march 2013 four army bases are to be closed and another three scaled back in major shake - up of forces sites which will save £ 240million - a - year			2
defence secretary @entity3 admitted the move would sever ‘ historic ties ’ between local communities and the army			1
but he defied a @entity8 warning from treasury minister @entity9 that ministers must not ' air dirty laundry ' over cuts in public , by again speaking out against further reductions in the @entity16 budget			1
cuts : four army bases are to be axed , including @entity17 in @entity18 , @entity19 where the @entity21 , @entity20 were stationed battle : defence secretary @entity3 , pictured arriving for @entity8 today , used the bases announcement to defy a warning from treasury minister @entity9 not to air ' dirty laundry ' over cuts in public under the plans announced today , all @entity29 troops are to be returned from @entity31 a year earlier than planned , with them based at @entity32 , @entity33 and @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 and the @entity39			1
but barracks in @entity41 , @entity18 , @entity33 and @entity42 will be axed as a result of a dramatic cut in the number size of the army			1
‘ the local communities in each of these areas have been hugely supportive of the military presence over many years , ’ mr @entity3 told mps			1
he said it was a plan ‘ that is driven by the army 's requirement to generate military capability in the most effective and efficient way as it reconfigures for contingent operations , based almost entirely in the @entity29 ’			1
mr @entity3 added : ' by setting out our plans to bring troops back to the @entity29 we are not only providing our service personnel and their families with greater stability for their future , but also generating a saving of around £ 240 million a year in operational running costs			2
' we are going to invest an additional £ 1.8 billion in our new basing plan , providing investment around the country , crucial jobs for local economies and the best possible accommodation for our soldiers and their families			0
' this work also supports and enables the army 2020 structure , announced last year , which will ensure that the @entity75 remains the most capable @entity75 in its class , adaptable and ready to meet the security challenges of the next decade and beyond			0
' closures : the cost - cutting plan will see the end of @entity81 , @entity82 , @entity41 ; @entity17 , @entity18 ; @entity83 in @entity33 ; and @entity84 in @entity85 , @entity42			1
parts of @entity87 , @entity33 ; @entity89 , @entity90 ; and @entity91 , @entity88 will also be cut back the bases which will be axed are : @entity81 , @entity82 , @entity41 ; @entity17 , @entity18 ; @entity83 in @entity33 and @entity84 in @entity85 , @entity42			1
parts of @entity87 , @entity33 ; @entity89 , @entity90 ; and @entity91 , @entity88 will also be cut back			2
around 11,000 @entity29 troops based in @entity31 will return home by 2016 under plans which will see nearly £ 2 billion invested in @entity75 housing and bases			2
it is equibalent to 70 per cent of the total and ahead of the plan to have half out by that date			0
the remaining 4,500 troops will be back in the @entity29 by 2019 , a year earlier than planned			0
around £ 1 billion of the funding being announced today will be go towards 1,900 new houses for service families and accommodation for 7,800 single soldiers			0
another £ 800 million will be spent on infrastructure and refurbishment of bases			0
however mr @entity3 used the announcement to launch another defence of his department 's budget , despite warnings hours earlier that ministers should stop publicly scrapping over funding			1
at this morning 's session of @entity8 , chief secretary to the treasury @entity9 told ministers to stop airing ' dirty laundry ' in public			1
the senior @entity124 said that this was ' no way to do business ' , adding : ' i would like to say it is really important that we do work together and that conversations between ministers are private			0
we should not air our dirty laundry in public			0
' but hours later mr @entity3 told reporters at a press conference : ' we have some challenging efficiencies which we are driving through now , including in the front line commands			2
' i have never said , and i would never say , that there are not further efficiencies that we can take and we are working right now to identify where we mighty find still further efficiencies across the defence budget			0
' but really , if we go beyond what can be delivered from efficiency , there will have to be a reassessment of the output that is delivered			0
