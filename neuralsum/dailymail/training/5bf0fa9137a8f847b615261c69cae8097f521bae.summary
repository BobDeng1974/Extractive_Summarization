by @entity0 published : 12:07 est , 1 may 2013 updated : 12:07 est , 1 may 2013 one is a top @entity2 fashion designer			0
the other is one of the world 's top costume experts			2
together @entity6 and @entity7 are a fashionable tour de force			1
the pair teamed up to create a wardrobe of dresses for @entity13 's character in @entity15 's hotly anticipated film , @entity14			1
now some of the 40 dresses are going on display in an exhibition at the @entity20 @entity19 which will run until 12th may			1
stunning : @entity14 star @entity13 poses in front of some of the @entity20 and @entity24 - designed frocks intricate : the heavily beaded flapper dresses will be on display at the @entity20 @entity27 until 12th may challenge : according to @entity24 , the hard part was making the frocks live up to @entity32 's vision @entity13 herself appeared a pale shadow of her glamorous character , @entity14 , in a drab black frock , although @entity38 looked wonderful in pale pink			1
luckily , the stunning 1920s inspired frocks , with their beading and sparkle , more than made up for @entity13 's lack of pizzazz and epitomised the glamour of the roaring twenties , although according to @entity20 herself , glamour was n't really a consideration during the design process			1
' when i read [ the book ] , it was psychological , ' she told @entity57 's website			2
' it was not about glamour for me			0
it was a real [ study of ] personality , very internalised			0
' it was meant to be about light			0
it became about money , because @entity66 wanted to show her as the most beautiful and rich woman on earth			1
' according to @entity24 , the real challenge was n't making gowns that were historically accurate but ensuring they lived up to @entity74 's characters			2
' the reality is that from 1920 , i could find a photo or a fashion illustration that would support almost any choice that we 've made in the film , ' @entity24 revealed			0
teamwork : director @entity66 and cast members @entity13 and @entity84 with @entity6 support : @entity87 @entity86 and actress @entity88 both attended the launch wearing @entity20 frocks inspiration : many of the gowns in the collection were inspired by past collections for @entity20 and @entity96 ' but we are not making a documentary			1
we are trying to express a story in a way in which @entity32 's visceral modernity is able to transgress the plane of the screen			2
' although the fabulous frocks have already appeared on the silver screen , they made their public debut during a launch party for the exhibition , which attracted some of @entity112 's glitziest stars			1
among them were @entity13 , who as @entity114 , was lucky enough to wear the frocks and @entity117 socialite , @entity116			0
also on the guest list was @entity38 , who looked fresh - faced and pretty in a pale pink @entity20 dress , and @entity88 , who also plumped for @entity20			0
write caption here decadent : @entity13 in one of the frocks as @entity124 alongside @entity125 as @entity126			0

some of the 1920s style flapper frocks are to go on display in @entity27
