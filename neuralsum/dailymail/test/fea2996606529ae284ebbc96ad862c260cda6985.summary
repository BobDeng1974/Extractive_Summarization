as @entity1 famously believes the @entity2 is ' nothing to watch ' without him , he 's unlikely to be quaking in his boots about facing @entity5 in the @entity6 on tuesday night			1
for most people , @entity8 's progress into the @entity10 semi-final looks a formality given they beat @entity13 3 - 1 in the first leg in @entity15			1
the only man bound to disagree is the one who modestly called his autobiography ' i am @entity1 '			1
@entity1 is put through his paces with @entity20 ( left ) and @entity21 at the @entity6 @entity1 and his @entity13 team - mates , including @entity23 , pictured , face @entity8 on tuesday night the @entity25 international was suspended for the first leg after he was dismissed against @entity27 at 33 , @entity1 is past caring what other people think of him			1
with an ego that makes @entity31 look like a shrinking violet , he 'll walk down the tunnel at the @entity6 convinced in his own mind that @entity5 , @entity35 and @entity36 will be in awe of him			0
when asked to name a dream team of team - mates he 'd played with , he named himself up front with @entity5 – ahead of @entity41 and @entity42			0
' football is n't something you plan in advance			0
it just happens , ' he says			0
his 30 - yard propellor kick for @entity25 against @entity49 is rated by @entity50 as the greatest goal he 's ever seen			0
to be fair , @entity1 's cv allows him plenty of bragging rights			2
the @entity54 with @entity56 roots has played for @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity8 and both @entity60 giants			1
he once won eight league titles in a row			0
not bad for a poor kid whose immigrant parents moved to the roughest part of @entity66			0
now he 's trying to make new history with @entity13			2
he was the marquee signing when @entity70 owners bought the @entity72 side and decided to try and turn it into @entity75 's greatest football club			0
they agreed to pay him £ 200,000 - a - week , even though @entity15 's 75 per cent top tax rate meant their total bill would be close to £ 50million a year			1
not that @entity1 is that overly grateful			2
he recently called @entity15 a 's * * t country ' and had to apologise in a rare burst of self - awareness			1
despite domestic dominance , @entity10 glory has remained elusive so far			0
@entity1 has never won the trophy as a player , and his bad luck in the competition continued when he was harshly sent off in the previous round against @entity27 and was therefore suspended for the first leg against @entity8			1
@entity1 is @entity13 's main attraction and will take centre stage against his old club @entity8 on tuesday the former @entity8 striker jumps for joy after scoirng against @entity95 in the @entity97 final @entity1 , pictured celebrating with @entity98 , will be convinced that @entity13 can progress against @entity8 for @entity72 to pull off one of @entity101 football 's greatest comebacks , @entity1 and @entity102 will have to excel			1
@entity1 undoubtedly has the talent to produce a flash of brilliance or two to put @entity107 's men under pressure			2
his balletic left - footed back heel while on the rise for @entity25 against @entity111 at @entity112 was a goal very few players could have scored			2
his famous strike against @entity49 silenced those who wondered why he could never produce against @entity118 clubs			0
against @entity8 , @entity1 will have special motivation			1
he spent a season at the @entity6 in 2009/10			0
it should have been the perfect stage for his talents but he moved to @entity60 after just a year			0
@entity1 spent just one season at the @entity6 before moving to serie a giants @entity60 he felt @entity5 's insistence on playing more centrally inhibited his own game and that coach @entity127 was n't strong enough to devise a system that could incorporate both of them			1
he called @entity127 a ' spineless coward ' after @entity8 were beaten by @entity132 's @entity60 in the @entity10			2
@entity1 made his point by scoring for @entity72 in @entity8 in a group game earlier this season			1
but this is the big one			0
nobody will give him a chance – except for @entity1 himself .			2

@entity1 will line up against former club @entity8 on tuesday
@entity13 travel to face the @entity143 giants trailing 3 - 1 in their @entity101 *tie*
the @entity15 club must score at least three times to reach the semi-finals
@entity1 is back in action after missing the first leg through *suspension*
