@entity0 , 19 , said she fears she will ' drop dead ' after being diagnosed with a hole in her heart three years ago a teenager who has a hole in her heart says she has been refused an operation to fix it on the @entity6 – unless she has a heart attack			1
@entity0 , 19 , has faced an agonising wait for surgery since being diagnosed with the condition three years ago			1
despite the procedure being routinely available for children and the elderly , she has been told she must fund the £ 16,000 operation herself , unless she has a heart attack or stroke			1
miss @entity0 , who regularly has palpitations and breathlessness , fears she could die before she is allowed to have the operation			1
she said : ‘ i ’m just going to be sitting around waiting for something bad to happen			2
i was really shocked when they told me			0
when we went for the meeting i thought the specialist was going to give me a date for the operation , not tell me i could n’t have it			0
’ the computer graphics apprentice , who has been off work for two months , added : ‘ if i was younger or older , the @entity31 would do it			0
‘ the @entity31 will only fund it if i have a heart attack or a stroke			0
that could leave long - term damage , or could even be life threatening			0
‘ i ’m worried i may drop dead if i exercise or do anything too strenuous			2
i ca n’t get on with normal life			0
’ miss @entity0 , from @entity41 , @entity42 , developed problems three years ago when doctors found a small hole between the left and right atria of her heart during a routine check - up			1
but despite bouts of breathlessness , palpitations and headaches , she was told there was nothing the @entity31 could do			2
cardiologists advised her that a private procedure was the only way to guarantee her health , at a minimum price of £ 16,000			1
she needs a procedure called a ‘ closure of a patent foramen ovale ’ , where a catheter is used to place a permanent implant in her heart which will close the hole			2
the 19 - year - old , pictured with her boyfriend @entity67 , said doctors have said a £ 16,000 operation to close the hole and treat her is not available on the @entity31			1
she suffers breathlessness and palpitations miss @entity0 , who is trying to raise money to have the operation privately , is believed to be suffering ‘ mini ’ strokes , but such an episode would have to be classed as ‘ major ’ before she will be given the operation on the @entity31			1
the only treatment she has received so far is blood - thinning aspirin			0
she said : ‘ my consultant said to me that because of my age there are no studies about the effects of a hole in the heart on my age group			0
‘ he said all the symptoms and problems are not proven to have been caused by [ the hole ] so there is no information to back up funding an operation			0
’ yesterday a spokesman for her regional branch of @entity96 said : ‘ [ the procedure ] is not routinely commissioned by the @entity31 and would only be considered if the case is deemed exceptional by the individual ’s clinician			1
@entity96 have not received an application regarding this case			0
