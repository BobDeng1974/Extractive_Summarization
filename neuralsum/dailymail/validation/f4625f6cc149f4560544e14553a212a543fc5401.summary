but this is not true , they are no more dangerous than any other breed of dog			0
' @entity104 are very intelligent , loving and loyal - but sadly this does n't stop people mistreating or abandoning them			0

if people stopped judging them and started helping them , it would really make a difference and prevent so many good dogs being put to sleep			0
