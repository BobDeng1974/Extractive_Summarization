the striker just ca n't stop scoring with two goals against @entity27 in the @entity24 on wednesday night sealing @entity5 's passage to the quarter - finals			1
if the 29 - year - old heads in the same direction , then there is no reason why @entity1 wo n't be remembered as the best @entity13 to have played in the @entity10			1

however , there is a reason why he swapped cosmopolitan @entity98 for the cold and wet side - streets of @entity97			0
