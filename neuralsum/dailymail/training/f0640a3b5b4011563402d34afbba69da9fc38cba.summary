it was billed as a death - defying stunt which was his most dangerous yet and would astonish millions			1
but @entity5 ’s latest feat has been dismissed as having ‘ no danger ’ by one of the world ’s most eminent physicists			1
professor @entity10 said he would be happy to take the illusionist ’s place even though he was 69 and by nature ‘ risk - averse ’			2
scroll down for live video sparks fly : thousands of volts from the coils stream towards @entity5 and through his steel suit protected : @entity5 ( left ) performs his latest stunt while wearing a specially made helmet			2
professor @entity10 ( right ) says the feat is so safe that even he would do it exercises : twenty - four hours into the three - day stunt , @entity5 appeared to be a little uncomfortable and did some stretching @entity5 has been standing in the middle of a million volts of electric current streamed by @entity28 for his stunt @entity30			1
they have been sending giant lightning bolts shooting towards him for the three - day event ending tonight			1
his only protection has been a suit of armour and a specially designed helmet			0
but the professor , an acclaimed space expert , said his only worry would be getting enough sleep			0
bolts from the blue : @entity5 has been standing in the middle of a million volts of electric current streamed by @entity45 for his stunt @entity30 @entity47 : the illusionist and endurance man was protected from the volts by a suit of chain mail and wire helmet ‘ he has a conducting suit , all the current is going through the suit , nothing through his body , ’ he said			1
‘ there is no danger that i see			0
i would do it , and i am 69 and risk - averse			0
i just would have to take a nap			0
’ he added that the magician was wearing a @entity67 suit made of highly conductive stainless steel			0
workmen use one if building high - voltage power lines and amateur physicists sometimes fashion their own while studying @entity28 coils			0
materials : prof @entity10 said that @entity5 was wearing a @entity67 suit made of highly conductive stainless steel @entity75 , a physicist at @entity76 , was also unimpressed			1
he said the only notable thing was that @entity5 was having to stand for 72 hours			2
the event in @entity79 also prompted the following post on @entity81 : ‘ @entity5 electrified ... if only			0
’ so far , the stunt is going to plan although @entity5 suffered an electric shock in practice when a visor on his helmet touched his nose			2
conductor : @entity5 has likened the sensation of being electrocuted to being ' banged very hard on the back of the head ' loved ones : @entity96 with his daughter @entity95 ( left ) and fiancee , model @entity93 ( right ) video : watch @entity5 perform his electricity stunt live video : watch the launch of @entity5 's incredible challenge here !			1
