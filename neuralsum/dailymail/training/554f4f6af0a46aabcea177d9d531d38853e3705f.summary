’ but mr @entity102 yesterday rejected the claim , ruling : ‘ extremely sad though it may be , this was a tragic and freak accident for which no blame can be established			1
’ ‘ on the evidence i have heard , the risk of injury was not such that steps should have been taken to guard against it			0
‘ in my judgment , the evidence of its likelihood was indeed “ lacking such reality that it could be disregarded ” and was at most “ a mere possibility which would never influence the mind of a reasonable man ”			0
