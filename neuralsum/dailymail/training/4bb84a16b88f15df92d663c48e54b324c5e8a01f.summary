by @entity0 published : 19:39 est , 2 march 2014 updated : 19:39 est , 2 march 2014 crisis : 140 out of 323 councils said they have had to invest public money in food banks for the poverty - stricken more than a third of councils are subsidising food banks at a cost of £ 3million to the taxpayer			1
an investigation has found that dozens of local authorities have put aside public cash to combat what they claim is a rising tide of food poverty			0
but some critics will question whether councils are using food banks as a political stick to beat the @entity22 over its welfare reforms			1
@entity24 asked all 375 councils in @entity26 and @entity27 about food banks and 323 responded			1
of those , 140 said they had provided funding over the past two years			0
while most councils paid for support such as management and administration , some were even paying for the food			2
the programme found that two councils covering the @entity41 and @entity42 constituency of the @entity43 , @entity44 , have between them committed almost £ 70,000 to food banks			1
the @entity22 has recently come under fire from @entity48 bishops over its welfare reforms , in an open letter describing food poverty as a national crisis			1
@entity52 , the archbishop of @entity53 , who joined the attacks on behalf of the @entity55 , said yesterday that people up and down the country were living in destitution			0
in a country as wealthy as @entity60 , this was a disgrace , he added			2
he said it was sometimes suggested that produce from food banks was sold on , but ‘ i listen to my priests and they have said that when they put , from the food bank , three days ’ food in front of a woman with her children , and she bursts into tears because she has n’t eaten for three days – that ’s not a fantasy , that ’s human lives ’			1
the @entity76 , @entity77 , told @entity24 : ‘ we need government to be explicit whether food banks are to be part of the system and , if they are , how do we make them work effectively			2
if they are not part of the system , we need a clear signal from government about that			0
’ ministers say food banks increase demand by offering free produce , and insist there is ‘ no robust evidence that welfare reforms are linked to increased use of food banks ’			1
@entity48 bishops have blasted the @entity22 for its welfare reforms which they claim have led to this crisis the @entity99 told @entity24 : ‘ food banks do not form part of the benefit system			1
‘ local authorities are now responsible for providing short - term , emergency help to those who need it and additional funding has been devolved to help them do so			0
local authorities are better placed to give local support than a central system			0
’ in @entity113 , the county council says its most pressing public health concern used to be healthy eating , but this had been overtaken by food poverty			0
the council has just invested £ 126,000 from its public health budget into food banks			1
counties like @entity113 have had to forego healthy eating programmes to help support those without food ‘ some people in the country are not able to eat at all and if people ca n’t eat at all , what ’s the point in trying to get them to eat healthily ? ’ said @entity125 , public health specialist at the council			0
professor @entity134 , a food policy expert at the @entity136 who helped produce a government - commissioned report about food aid , said : ‘ food banks are an inadequate plaster over a gaping wound			2
‘ they do not solve the problems			0
and that they should be enshrined as an inadequate solution is deeply immoral			0
’ last night the @entity148 think - tank claimed 68,000 people had their welfare payments stopped unfairly each year , heightening demand for food banks			1
dr @entity153 , a research fellow at the @entity154 , said there was ‘ an undeniable link ’ between the tougher benefits regime and the increased use of food banks .			2
