mr @entity113 added that mr @entity11 's claim that police changed the first statement about his son 's movements showed he was prepared to level false accusations at officers			1
' the police officers who will testify at this trial are the brave men and women who deserve part of the credit for bringing @entity11 [ @entity17 ] to justice for murder			2
they did not attack the claimant , negligently injure him , falsely imprison him or trespass on his premises ' , mr @entity113 told the court			0
' we expect and require police officers to take very great risks with their own safety and health in order to protect the public from people like @entity147 ' on 30 june , 2008 , numerous officers entered the claimant 's flat not knowing if they would be attacked by desperate and violent men who had recently killed			0
' the work of specialist homicide detectives in the claimant 's flat and with the claimant contributed to bringing these men to justice			0
