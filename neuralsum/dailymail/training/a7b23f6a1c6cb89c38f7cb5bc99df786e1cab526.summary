by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter @entity3 : 00:42 est , 23 december 2013 @entity4 : 19:44 est , 23 december 2013 it is one of the most inspiring moments in military history – @entity10 and @entity11 soldiers downing their guns on christmas day to play football together in the mud of @entity15			1
but previously unseen documents show not everyone in the trenches during the truce of 1914 was quite such a good sport			1
the @entity21 of the @entity22 – formed of men from the tough streets of @entity25 – simply ignored the offer to take part			1
rare find : this recently discovered photograph is one of a haul showing the soldiers of the 1st @entity22 - who refused to shake hands with their @entity11 enemies on christmas day , 1914 when a @entity11 soldier shouted over from the opposing trench ‘ @entity40 , @entity40 why you not come across ? ’ a gruff @entity36 voice replied : ‘ cause we do n’t trust you and ye hae been four months shooting at us			1
’ a record of the conversation has been released by journalist @entity45 , from memoirs and photographic albums compiled by his grandfather @entity48 , who served as a medical officer with the battalion			1
among the documents are @entity53 photographs which show the @entity22 stayed in their trenches near the northern @entity56 town of @entity57			1
mr @entity45 , from @entity58 , said : ‘ the @entity22 were a bunch of bloody - minded @entity25			1
even though it was @entity53 they were pretty grumpy and saw no reason why they should play football with people who had been trying to kill them a day before			0
’ an estimated 100,000 men are thought to have taken part in the unofficial – and unrepeated – truce along the @entity69 , which included gift - giving			0
stubborn : even though it was @entity53 the men saw no reason why they should do what some of their colleagues did and play football with people who had been trying to kill them the day before instead of emerging from their trenches near the northern @entity56 town of @entity57 to shake hands with the enemy , the @entity22 dug in and did what they could to make christmas day 99 years ago as memorable as possible			1
the @entity53 photos and exchanges came to light thanks when writer @entity45 discovered three battered photograph albums compiled by his grandfather , @entity88 , who served as a medical officer with the regiment during @entity92			1
the soldiers were officially banned from taking cameras into the rat - infested trenches , but despite this they took snaps of each other to raise their spirits amid the horrors of the daily carnage they were witnessing			2
their pocket @entity104 cameras recorded the grainy snapshots of a regiment that had an unequivocal attitude to the @entity11 embedded nearby - even at @entity53			1
@entity88 , who always carried his camera in his vest pocket , took a set of pictures of the 1st @entity22 that included stretcher bearers and a soldier draped in tinsel as he held a dog by a lead in a trench			1
he later captioned the picture of the soldier and dog ' @entity122 1914			0
many soldiers kept mongrels they had adopted as strays to keep the rat population under control			0
festive : one soldier in the trenches has added pieces of tinsel to his uniform , as he holds his dog on a lead , while his comrades pretend to load their weapons for @entity88 's trusty camera the five stretcher bearers , non of them wearing protective helmets , were wrapped up in what they called ' teddy bears ' - goatskin jerkins issued to combat the biting wind			1
the absence of helmets was down to the lack of equipment supplied to the @entity10 troops early in the war compared to their @entity11 foe who had the best and latest military hardware and clothing available			2
painstaking research conducted by @entity45 has now resulted in the book @entity158 - based on the 250 pictures covering 1914 and 1915 as his grandfather served as a 25 - year - old doctor with the @entity22			1
contraband : officially the soldiers were banned from taking cameras into the trenches , although the rule did not stop @entity48 and his trusty @entity169 camera mr @entity45 , a 54 - year - old journalist who lives in @entity58 , said : ' basically the @entity22 were a bunch of bloody - minded @entity25			1
' even though it was @entity53 they were pretty grumpy and saw no reason why they should do what some of their colleagues did and play football with people who had been trying to kill them the day before			0
' but these pictures show real people in real war situations at @entity53			2
the regiment was on it 's last day of five days fighting on the front line before they were due some time off in the bars and brothels of nearby @entity57 on @entity186			2
' men love dogs and this one had obviously been left behind by fleeing refugees			0
the sign around the soldier 's neck says something like @entity194 but it is impossible to read it properly			0
' the stretcher bearers picture shows how ill - equipped the @entity199 was			0
non of these men went out into no - man 's - land to get their injured mates even under heavy fire wearing helmets			0
they did n't have them			0
' they resemble just a piratical rabble more than @entity10 soldiers			0
' on @entity186 the @entity22 were relieved of their front line duties by men of the @entity213 regiment and returned to billets in @entity57 for what diaries of the time describe as a ' prolonged alcoholic party			2
' @entity45 never knew his grandfather who died two days before he was born			0
the photo albums had been handed down through the generations			0
it was forbidden under @entity199 orders to use cameras while serving on the front line but the commanding officer of the @entity22 knew his men were using the earliest folding @entity104 cameras and turned a blind eye			2
@entity88 was wounded but survived the war as did his unique photos			2
find : the @entity53 photos came to light after @entity45 discovered three battered photograph albums compiled by his grandfather @entity48 mr @entity45 added : ' it was a regiment happy to make its own rules and the officers thought nothing of breaking @entity199 rules			1
' thank goodness they did because we have these wonderful pictures			0
' they were a group of men who certainly liked having their pictures taken and it has left a fantastic record of what life was like in the trenches			0
' we can look at the picture now and maybe feel blessed that our @entity53 will be happy , warm and safe			0
