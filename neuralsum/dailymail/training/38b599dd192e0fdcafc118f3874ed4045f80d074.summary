and then there were two			0
for @entity2 , that is			1
if the @entity5 captain is to mark his long goodbye with a trophy it will have to be in the @entity8 or the @entity9			2
@entity10 move on to @entity11 in the @entity13 final and their supporters did not miss the chance to remind him that another chance had passed him by			1
@entity2 did not linger on the pitch at @entity19			1
he applauded the away fans in the @entity19 and disappeared down the tunnel , leaving the home team to savour their victory			2
@entity5 captain @entity2 ( right ) shakes hands with @entity10 centre back @entity25 at full - time over the two legs , @entity5 could be satisfied with their performance			1
while clearly lacking a finisher - a potent threat in front of goal to give purpose to their pleasing approach play - they pushed @entity10 into extra-time which in itself amounts to a sign of recovery after a dreadful few months			1
@entity40 has hauled this team up from their knees , from the november low in the capital when they were beaten at @entity45 , a fourth successive defeat			2
that day at @entity48 , a dejected @entity5 boss confessed his job was not safe , but he and his team have responded , even if they were not able to stop the slide out of the @entity53			2
this was only their second defeat in 17 since @entity45			0
more importantly , @entity40 has seen his team recapture some of the zest and intensity which was a trademark of last season			2
@entity2 and @entity10 striker @entity60 get up , close and personal during the tense clash at @entity19 @entity2 and @entity60 both receive yellow cards from referee @entity64 for their altercation over two legs , they have genuinely troubled @entity10 , the team which won at @entity67 in april and sparked their collapse in the title race			1
@entity40 has tweaked his formation , finally realising that the system designed to get the most from @entity72 and @entity73 was of limited use with @entity72 in @entity75 and @entity73 injured			1
the tempo is up , thanks in part to the energy of @entity80 who appears refreshed after his @entity83 break			0
perhaps @entity2 ’s decision to confirm his plans to leave for @entity86 at the end of the season has done everyone a favour , too			2
the talisman is on his way and it is time for others to stand up and seize the chance to succeed him as the team ’s spiritual leader			0
@entity99 ( centre ) caused @entity10 plenty of problems over the two legs of the semi-final at the same time , @entity40 has been able to use him more sparingly , give him the rest he needs and squeeze more from him in the most important fixtures , like this one			1
@entity2 was influential at @entity19 , especially in the first - half , when @entity5 were at their most fluent in attack caused @entity10 problems			1
his passing brought the wing - backs into the game and took advantage of the holes appearing in @entity10 ’s defensive unit			0
@entity120 , for all his defensive acumen and attention to detail , has not found it easy to quash the threats of @entity80 and @entity99 over the two legs of this semi-final			0
were it not for @entity125 , who made first - half saves which bought @entity10 the time to adjust and fight their way back into the game last night , it might have been different			0
@entity5 striker @entity130 ( centre ) entered the fray with 20 minutes but once again proved ineffective moreover , if @entity5 had a striker it might have been different			1
they might have won this second leg by half - time with a deadly finisher in the team like , for example , @entity72			0
or even with @entity73 , who is still not quite fit , which seems to have been his operational status for quite a while			0
@entity130 was again not the answer			0
coming off the bench with 20 minutes of normal time remaining , he was unable to contribute anything useful , smashing one sharp chance high into the @entity148 and curling an ambitious effort over from a tight angle when he would have been better off passing the ball			0
@entity80 , despite scoring the goal in the first leg , does not yet have the composure to offer a reliable source of goals – and there was to be no heroic rescue act from @entity2			1
perhaps he will save that for one of the other competitions .			0

@entity10 move on to @entity11 in the @entity13 final
@entity2 did not linger on the pitch at @entity19 after the loss
@entity5 have improved recently after a dreadful few months
@entity40 has tweaked his formation after finally realising that it does *n't* work without @entity72 and @entity73
@entity5 are still struggling to score goals without a *quality* striker
