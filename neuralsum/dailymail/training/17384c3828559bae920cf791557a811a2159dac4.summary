by @entity0 a 45 - storey slum which featured in the hit @entity3 television series @entity4 is being cleared by soldiers – after becoming notorious around the world			1
thought to be the world ’s tallest slum , the ‘ @entity8 ’ skyscraper has been home to thousands of @entity12 in the capital city of @entity14 over the years			1
but soldiers and officials have started a mass - eviction of the half - built tower , which once appeared in the third series of @entity4 , starring @entity20 and @entity21			1
pictured is a scene from series three episode three of the show the building has become notorious for drugs and crime while politicians say it has become unsafe with children having fallen to their death			2
during the week , hundreds of families will be ‘ peacefully ’ moved out of the building , which was originally intended to be a bank centre			0
it was abandoned in 1994 and later became home to thousands of squatters			0
residents are going to new homes in the town of @entity55 , south of @entity14 , under the state 's @entity57 project - a flagship policy of late socialist leader @entity60			1
nicknamed after its developer , the financier and horse - breeder @entity62 , the @entity8 was viewed by many @entity14 residents as a focus for crime gangs and a symbol of property ‘ invasions ’ encouraged in the @entity60 era			1
residents , though , said the building became a refuge from the city 's crime - ridden ' barrios ' and had turned into something of a model commune			2
an initial 160 families , out of a total of more than 1,150 , are being moved out of the tower this week politicians say the half - built skyscraper has become unsafe and that children have fallen to their deaths people wait inside the @entity8 , ahead of being evicted to @entity88 - provided apartments but politicians say people had fallen off dangerous ledges while there are no elevators and only makeshift power and water services			1
@entity14 police did not share the view of a model community , raiding several times to look for kidnap victims			2
the vistas , however , matched those of the city 's finest high - rise buildings			0
president @entity105 's government has not yet said what it will do with the tower , but one local newspaper reported @entity110 banks were buying it to restore to its original purpose			0
the @entity8 appeared a number of times in the third series of the hit @entity3 television show , @entity4			1
the building is depicted as a lawless place where thugs participated in international conspiracies and killed with impunity episode three of the third series is even named ' @entity8 ' and follows the fortunes of @entity124 ( played by @entity20 ) after he is taken to the building suffering from two bullet wounds in the abdomen			1
@entity124 ( left ) , played by @entity20 , in @entity8 , the third episode of the third series of @entity4 he is held in the squat by a gang of mercenaries led by a man who is aware of @entity124 's true identity			1
after being nursed back to health , he escapes the skyscraper and seeks refuge in a mosque , only for him to be arrested following a tip off to the police by the imam			0
however , the mercenaries find @entity124 and , after killing the police officers , the imam and his wife , take him back to the tower where he is confined to a cell			0
as the episode ends , @entity124 - alone in his cell - injects himself with heroin			2
‘ the tower does not meet the minimum conditions for safe , dignified living , ’ @entity150 , minister for the transformation of @entity14 , told reporters at the scene , declining to speculate on its future			2
mr @entity150 said the eviction was necessary because the tower , which lacked basic fixtures such as walls or windows , was unsafe			0
children have fallen to their deaths , he added			0
and the damp , foul - smelling concrete courtyard where he spoke to reporters was evidence of the lack of plumbing			0
an initial 160 families , out of a total of more than 1,150 , were being moved out this week , he added			0
dozens of residents boarded buses tuesday morning to move to new , government - provided apartments in @entity55 , a town about 23 miles ( 37 kilometers ) south of @entity14			1
