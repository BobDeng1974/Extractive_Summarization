they say a picture is worth a thousand words , but this one will be worth a thousand years			0
@entity4 , a conceptual artist and journalist , plans to capture the world 's longest photo exposure , @entity3 reports			1
a camera filled with oil paint instead of photographic film will capture the 1,000 - year - long exposure of @entity12 , @entity13			1
@entity4 calls this and similar creations ' deep time cameras			2
' exposure : @entity4 ( photographed ) , a conceptual artist and journalist , plans to capture the world 's longest photo exposure , a 1,000 - year - long exposure of @entity12 , @entity13 the camera , with a 24 - karat gold plate on its front , will be installed three feet above ground at the @entity27 's sculpture garden trellis after it is unveiled friday at the museum			1
the camera will be pointed at the city 's skyline , capturing how civilization changes over the next 1,000 years			1
over time , the color in the paint will fade where the light enters the camera the brightest , slowly -- very slowly -- creating an image of the @entity12 skyline in red and white			1
the experiment will be finished in spring 3015 and the museum will hold a month - long exhibit when the project is complete -- if everything goes according to plan in the next 1,000 years , of course , @entity40 reports			1
' the first people to see this picture will be children who have n't yet been conceived , ' @entity4 told @entity3			2
' they 're impacted by every choice we make , but they 're powerless			0
if they ca n't influence our decisions , at least they can bear witness			0
' camera : the camera , with a 24 - karat gold plate on its front , will be installed three feet above ground at the @entity27 's sculpture garden trellis after it is unveiled friday at the museum this experiment will be one @entity4 wo n't live to see , neither will his children , nor his children 's children , nor his children 's children 's child - okay , you get the point			1
but @entity4 told @entity3 that he does n't mind being not being able to attend the exposure 's unveiling in 3015			1
' i 'll be dead , ' @entity4 said			2
' but i do n't regret it at all			0
for me , it 's much more interesting to be here today , seeing the behavior of people who know they 're being watched by the unborn , and also to be watched myself , living vicariously as a future memory of the next millennium			0
' @entity4 told @entity40 that the resulting photos wo n't be confusing , but will require a bit of interpretation to deconstruct what is recorded in the photo			2
skyline : the camera will be pointed at the city 's skyline ( photographed ) , capturing how civilization changes over the next 1,000 years he told @entity3 that the photograph will not only show @entity12 's skyline , but will illustrate how it develops over time			1
' for instance , old houses torn down after a couple centuries will show up only faintly , as if they were ghosts haunting the skyscrapers that replace them , ' @entity4 said			0
@entity4 told @entity40 that he ca n't guarantee that the picture will be perfect or even perceptible			0
in fact , he said , it may take multiple attempts to get the exposure just right -- that could take thousands of years			2
but he said he does not see that as a fault			0
' a total failure photographically could still be a success conceptually , ' he said			0
@entity4 said he chose @entity12 because it is representative of urban expansion throughout the @entity113			1
he said he plans to install a second camera in @entity115 .			0
