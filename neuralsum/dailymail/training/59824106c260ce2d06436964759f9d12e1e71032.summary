by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter published : 04:32 est , 6 november 2013 updated : 18:04 est , 6 november 2013 a former @entity3 , who hijacked a plane and forced it to fly to @entity6 , is set to return to the @entity7 to face justice today			1
@entity9 said he is homesick and wants to return to @entity7 for the first time in almost three decades			1
mr @entity9 , 56 , who has been working with @entity7 diplomats in @entity12 in recent weeks to get a passport , said they told him yesterday that his travel arrangements were made and he could leave on a charter flight to @entity16 today			1
he hopes the 13 years he served in @entity6 for the hijacking will be taken into consideration by @entity7 authorities but admits he may be sent to prison			1
mr @entity9 said he seeks ' closure ' by facing the @entity7 justice system			1
he argues that the time he served in the @entity36 prison outside @entity12 should mitigate further punishment back home			1
' i 'm ready for whatever , ' @entity9 said			1
' my position is , of course , i did the crime and i did the time , and the @entity7 has to recognize that			2
' mr @entity9 was jailed after hijacking a commercial plane in 1984 when he pulled a gun hidden in a plaster cast and forced it to land in @entity6 , where he expected authorities to offer him guerrilla training			1
instead he was sentenced to 15 years in prison			2
since his release , he settled down became a farmer and had two daughters with his second wife			0
revolutionary times : armed members of the @entity59 leave the @entity60 in @entity61 may 2nd , 1967 he was granted permanent residency in @entity6 and he and his now ex-wife live in a modest @entity67 - style apartment block east of @entity12			1
mr @entity9 said : ' i 've got kind of mixed emotions , let me say that at least , about touching @entity7 soil for the first time in nearly 30 years			1
' so much has changed , and i 'm just going to have to wait and see what it looks like when i get there			0
' the @entity59 was a revolutionary organization in the @entity7 calling for empowerment of @entity77 and protection from police brutality			0
set up in 1966 , the leaders of the group backed socialist and @entity83 doctrines and eventually had affiliations with communist @entity6			1
the organization created a @entity87 that cemented its economic and political grievances and the party gained national prominence during the rest of the 1960s and 1970s			0
the party was officially disbanded in the early 1980s			0
notable @entity3 members fled to @entity6 , including @entity95 - the aunt of murdered rapper @entity96			2
she was accused of murdering two @entity98 @entity97 in 1973 and indited in relation to other crimes including attempted murder and armed robbery			0
she escaped from prison in 1979 and has been living in @entity6 in political asylum since 1984			1
he said his understanding was that he would be escorted by @entity7 officials and delivered into the custody of @entity7 marshals on arrival in @entity111			2
' what happens after that i could n't tell you , ' he said			0
' i hope to be arraigned soon			0
' in the 1960s and early ' 70s , there were dozens of @entity7 hijackings to @entity6			2
as a way of discouraging them , both sides signed a 1971 agreement under which each government agreed to prosecute hijackers or return them to the other country			0
the @entity7 has limited travel to @entity6 since 1960 when @entity127 came to power			2
the rules were amended in 2011 to allow all @entity77 to visit @entity6 but direct flights by @entity7 airlines are still illegal			2
it is unclear what stance @entity7 authorities will take against mr @entity9 as the @entity7 @entity135 , @entity136 and @entity6 officials did not have any comment on his case			1
@entity7 authorities have aggressively prosecuted some returning fugitives , while others saw their sentences reduced significantly for time served elsewhere			0
even though @entity9 intends to continue to call @entity6 home for the foreseeable future , he decided to return to the @entity7 and take his chances with the legal system			1
the pending case against him keeps him from living his life fully , he said			0
he said : ' it 's time it had closure			0
why leave it hanging , why leave this gaping uncertainty ? ' so i want to resolve that because ... having completed my sentence , i feel like i want to put all that stuff behind me			0
' i do n't want that lingering over or impeding anything i might want to do			0
once you 've paid your debt to society you 're entitled to a fresh start			0
