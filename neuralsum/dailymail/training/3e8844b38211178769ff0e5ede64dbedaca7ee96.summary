@entity6 , whose @entity9 side lead spurs 1 - 0 going into the second leg of their @entity12 tie on thursday , recently blamed the club for ruining his reputation in @entity15			1
but @entity3 , who worked with the @entity17 manager at @entity18 in 2007 - 08 , claims @entity6 : hitting back : former @entity4 sporting director @entity3 has lifted the lid on the disastrous year when @entity6 , now boss of @entity9 , was in charge at @entity18 all smiles at the start : @entity3 , left , and @entity6 were on good terms when the @entity25 joined but the pair 's working relationship would not stay so healthy at the beginning : @entity6 was hired in 2007 but would not last long as @entity4 boss @entity3 says @entity6 was out of touch with the @entity31 and did not listen to advice from chairman @entity33 and the board to adapt his style of management from @entity17			1
‘ one thing that worried me straight away after we appointed him from @entity40 was something their sporting director @entity42 told me , ’ said @entity3 , 41			1
‘ he was a friend of mine , so i rang and apologised for taking their manager halfway through the season			0
' he said that the coach from their reserve team was probably better than @entity6 and that we ’d soon find out he ’s not the reason for the club ’s success			1
’ but within four months of taking over from @entity56 , @entity6 won the @entity57 , the club ’s first trophy since 1999			1
‘ we thought we were on to something good , ’ said @entity3			2
but behind the scenes the situation was turning into a nightmare			0
silverware joy : @entity4 won the @entity57 in 2008 by beating @entity66 2 - 1 thanks to a goal from @entity68 , centre , at @entity70 @entity71 moment : @entity6 gets soaked holding the 2008 @entity57 by @entity73 as @entity74 looks on ‘ when you interview a manager or a potential candidate you put the culture of your club , what you ’re about , on the table straight away			1
' we made it clear to him we could n’t afford to buy stars , we wanted to make them			0
we could n’t compete with @entity66 or @entity86 like that			0
he said , “ no problem , i ’m good at that ”			0
' he mentioned he was the coach of @entity91 then as soon as he came in , he said , “ i want @entity92 and @entity93 ”			0
he was n’t interested in young players at all			0
’ not enough : @entity6 , near left , signed , left to right , @entity96 , @entity68 , @entity97 and @entity98 but wanted bigger names at @entity4 unrealistic targets : @entity93 , left , and @entity92 were two transfer targets @entity6 wanted to sign for @entity4 but the club could not afford their wages at the insistence of @entity6 , @entity3 met the two players ’ representatives			1
‘ @entity92 was already on four times what our biggest earner was on and his agent said he wanted more			0
it was impossible with @entity112 as well			0
@entity4 just could n’t sign players like that			1
’ while @entity6 was in charge , the club had @entity117 and @entity118 , who would later move to @entity119 for combined fees of £ 118million			1
spurs finished 11th in the first season he took over and in the following campaign he was axed with the club bottom , on two points after eight games			0
@entity17 swoop : @entity119 bought @entity117 , left , and @entity118 from @entity4 @entity129 ticket secured : within two seasons of @entity132 taking over at @entity4 , the club were in the @entity133 @entity132 replaced him and two seasons later they qualified for the @entity133			1
@entity6 sold @entity137 and @entity138 — two players @entity132 brought back , @entity138 for twice the price they received from @entity141 for him			2
@entity3 worked under @entity142 at @entity143 and saw first - hand the training methods of tactician @entity145 at @entity146 , so speaks from experience when he says : ‘ @entity132 instilled in the side a good team spirit , trusted the players and they rewarded him			1
former red : @entity3 had a spell at @entity146 as the club 's director of sports strategy ‘ with @entity6 the players did n’t trust him			1
he tried to convince the board the players we had were poor but we had great players			0
' he could n’t use them or get the best out of them , could n’t connect with them or get any kind of team spirit			0
‘ he pushed them so hard in training they got injuries			0
they were too tired mentally and physically from his training regime			0
i felt the players went into games tactically underprepared			2
’ taskmaster : according to @entity3 , @entity6 pushed players too hard in training help not wanted : @entity177 , left , was brought in to help @entity6 , centre , but he would not discuss team selection with the @entity180 @entity4 brought in @entity177 to help but @entity6 would not discuss team selection with the @entity180			1
problems mounted in the first pre-season @entity6 had at the club in 2008			2
‘ it started to become a nightmare , ’ recalled @entity3			2
‘ training died , the relationship with players was gone , there was no dialogue with them			2
’ it came to a head when @entity4 had their worst start to a top - flight season			2
decision made : @entity4 chairman @entity33 , centre , fired @entity6 in 2008 when the club made their worst start to a top - flight season @entity3 , @entity177 and first - team coach @entity201 were fired when @entity6 was			1
‘ i lost my job because of him but after he left we kept in touch , ’ said @entity3			2
