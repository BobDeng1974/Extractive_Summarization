ministers are drawing up new rules to put courts under a legal duty to ensure divorced parents are guaranteed access to their children			1
parents who refuse to accept the orders will be in contempt of court and risk serious penalties or even jail			1
the move will delight fathers ’ rights campaigners who believe dads are penalised under the present system which usually grants mothers custody			1
hope : fathers rights ' campaigners will be delighted at the news because they can currently be refused access when mothers are granted custody the @entity24 is hoping to succeed where @entity25 failed			1
in early 2005 , it tried to force mothers to let partners see their children by threatening to impose penalties such as night curfews and electronic tagging			1
deputy prime minister @entity32 and @entity34 work and pensions secretary @entity33 have apparently agreed a different approach which they hope will be more successful			1
around 3.8million children - one in three - live without their father			1
last night children ’s minister @entity39 said : ‘ our vision is to establish that , under normal circumstances , a child will have a relationship with both his or her parents , regardless of their relationship with each other			1
' we must do everything we can to improve the system so that it gives children the best chance of growing up under the guidance of two loving parents			2
new families : @entity32 believes the @entity24 's efforts will give more children the chance to grow up with two parents ' all the evidence tells us that children genuinely benefit from a relationship with both parents , with the potential to make different contributions to their child ’s development			2
' the culture has shifted away from the traditional view that mothers are primarily responsible for the care of children			2
increasingly society recognises the valuable and distinct role of both parents			2
' we are looking closely at all the options for promoting shared parenting through possible legislative and non-legislative means			0
' mr @entity39 ’s comments indicate that ministers have gone against a key finding of november ’s family justice review , which rejected equal access for mothers and fathers , saying it would put too much pressure on judges			0
it is believed that the law could be changed by amending the 1989 @entity94 to include presumption of shared parenting			0
another option would be for the government to support a backbench bill by @entity34 mp @entity99 , which will be debated later this month			0
the bill requires courts and councils which are enforcing contact orders for children ‘ to operate under the presumption that the rights of a child include growing up knowing and having access to and contact with both parents involved ’			0
@entity112 , campaign director for @entity113 , said a @entity97 move would be a ‘ massive step forward ’			0
' it is saying that dads have as many rights as mums , ' she said			0
' i will believe it when i see it , but the reform has to apply across the family justice system			0

those who refuse to accept ruling could risk jail
*coalition* hopes to succeed where @entity25 failed when it mooted curfews and electronic tagging in 2005
