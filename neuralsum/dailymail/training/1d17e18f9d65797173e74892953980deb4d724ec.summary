by @entity1 reporter published : 09:23 est , 3 october 2012 updated : 11:40 est , 3 october 2012 a woman who lied to police that she had been knocked down by a van on a zebra crossing in an attempt to secure a compensation payout has avoided jail			1
@entity8 , 26 , was almost clipped by the van as she was approaching the crossing in june 2011			1
but she used the opportunity to hatch a plan to make money , and instantly rang police pretending the van had knocked her over			0
@entity8 then compounded her lies by feigning a leg injury and calling paramedics to her house after she ' managed to hobble home '			1
liar : @entity8 instantly rang police after pretending to be hit by a van on a zebra crossing but in reality the mother - of - one , from @entity24 , @entity25 , was completely unharmed			1
@entity28 @entity27 heard how @entity8 , quickly got in contact with her solicitor , putting in a personal injury claim the very next day after the incident , as police tried to track down the mystery van driver			1
@entity8 's deceit only became apparent after she was exposed when @entity36 was recovered from two passing buses at the scene of the make - believe accident			1
@entity40 , prosecuting , said : ' @entity8 told police a white van continued onto the crossing , she tried to get out of the way and stepped back but it struck her on her left knee and she was knocked onto the road			2
walking free : @entity8 has been handed a three - month jail sentence suspended for a year with supervision ' she claimed someone had stopped to help her , that she was in considerable pain , and had managed to hobble home			2
' @entity8 admitted perverting justice in june last year			2
she was handed a three - month jail sentence suspended for a year with supervision on monday , october 1			2
@entity56 told her : ' i have no difficulty in reaching the conclusion the custodial threshold has been passed			0
' but having regard to your previous good character , that you were under considerable pressure at the time , and that custody would have disastrous consequences for you , your five - year - old son and your accommodation , it seems to me the most appropriate sentence is to suspend that term of imprisonment			0
' it was brought to light that @entity8 was out of work at the time of the incident			0
@entity78 , defending , said the lies that followed had ' got out of control '			0
he said : ' the van driver did drive onto the zebra crossing when she was about halfway across but that does not justify the exaggeration she subsequently perpetrated			1
' it ’s clear she was soon having second thoughts			0
she was not persistent in pressing the civil claim for compensation			0
' @entity8 ' claimed someone had stopped to help her , that she was in considerable pain , and had managed to hobble home			0
