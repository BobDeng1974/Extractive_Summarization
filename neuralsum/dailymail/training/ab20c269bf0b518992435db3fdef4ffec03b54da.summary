he was living in pride 2 at the park alongside lionesses @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 and @entity24			0
the story of the lions moved thousands of people to donate over £ 150,000 to bring @entity11 and 12 other lions back to the purpose built @entity46 at @entity14			2
the 13 lions arrived at the @entity14 in 2010 and were slowly rehabilitated into their new home under much veterinary care and careful husbandry by staff			1
a spokesman at @entity14 said : ‘ without any prior warning , the pride which included four females , had a fight in which @entity11 was injured			1
‘ @entity56 managed to separate the other lions within minutes of the fight starting and called them into the house , where the vet attended @entity11			2
‘ unfortunately , his injuries were such that there was no option but for him to be put to sleep			0
‘ this was extremely distressing for the staff who have cared for 16 year old @entity11 since he arrived in the @entity69 in 2010 and especially as the whole episode was completely unprecedented and out of character for the pride			1
’ despite staff at the park intervening in the fight , 16 - year - old @entity11 was too injured to survive @entity11 ( not pictured ) was one of the 13 lions whose plight was highlighted in a campaign to rescue them from appalling conditions in run down @entity39 in @entity6 the lions regained their health and strength and enjoyed life in @entity46 , and thousands of people have been to see them			1

‘ the directors of @entity14 would like to thank the veterinary teams from @entity90 from @entity91 who responded so quickly to this unexpected event and who have worked and supported staff to help improve the health of @entity11 and the other lions since their arrival			1
‘ @entity99 would also like to thank the dedicated staff team who have loved and cared for @entity11 since his arrival and who today are shocked at the sudden loss of one who was a favourite at the @entity14 for staff and visitors alike			2
’ @entity11 is the third of the lions to die since his arrival in the @entity69			2
@entity112 died in june 2012 while @entity113 died in january of this year			0

despite more than 20,000 people signing an online petition to save the two - year - old animal , staff went ahead and shot @entity125 with a bolt pistol			1
the @entity129 zoo said the drastic move , a killing witnessed by watching schoolchildren , was needed to combat inbreeding and insisted the display was educational			0
last month , @entity125 the giraffe was killed , chopped up and fed to lions at @entity128 in @entity129 keepers shot the infant with a bolt gun before dissecting his body in front of a crowd including children but animal rights campaigners condemned the killing of @entity125 , saying it exposed the cruel reality of welfare even in @entity156 ’s top zoos			0
@entity125 ’s plight had triggered worldwide outpourings of protest , including an offer to rehome him in @entity69 , with many saying they were sickened by a zoo killing a healthy animal			0
despite protestations , the zoo announced @entity125 had been killed with a bolt gun instead of a lethal injection , which would have contaminated the flesh			0
his carcass was then skinned and chopped up while visitors crowded around and the meat was fed to the lion population			0
after the autopsy @entity125 was fed to the lions , with staff calling the procedure part of the ' circle of life ' on the same day , @entity178 admitted it put down two lions and four cubs			2
the @entity182 park said it had too many lions and they were growing violent			0
but visitors asked why new homes were not found .			0
