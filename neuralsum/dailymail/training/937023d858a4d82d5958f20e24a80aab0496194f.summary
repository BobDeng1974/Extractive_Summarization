his artist ’s eye must have found the scene irresistible			1
the abbey ruins in the distance were bathed in the setting sun and the stony heath where he stood with his easel was lush with the green of twisted holly oaks			1
if only @entity12 had been happy enough with his painting that day to have signed it			1
but the grand @entity15 master never liked the result of this particular excursion to the @entity19 countryside , and never put his name to it			1
return of the vanished @entity12 : museum director @entity22 described the discovery as a ' once - in - a - lifetime experience ' at an unveiling of the masterpiece ' @entity27 ' : it is the first full - size canvas by the @entity15 master discovered since 1928			1
the museum said the painting belongs to an unidentified private collector and will be on display at the museum from september 24 yesterday – after being branded a fake , dumped in an attic and hidden from public view for more than a century – the oil on canvas was finally hailed as a masterpiece			1
researchers linked ‘ @entity27 ’ to @entity12 ’s hand - written musings about what he did that day in the summer of 1888 – and used 21st century technology to confirm the painting ’s authenticity			1
now the long - lost work is to go on show as the first full - size @entity12 to emerge for 85 years			1
if it is ever offered for sale it is likely to attract bids in the tens of millions			1
the landscape was painted on july 4 , 1888 , and mentioned the next day in a letter the artist wrote to his brother @entity58			1
he described the scene but expressed disappointment at the painting , saying : ‘ it was well below what i ’d wished to do			1
' @entity12 , who struggled with bouts of mental illness , was often highly critical of his own work , including some of his most famous , such as ‘ @entity69 ’ , which he painted the following year			2
after he died from a self - inflicted gunshot wound in 1890 , ‘ @entity27 … ’ was listed by number in @entity58 ’s collection			1
it was bought about 20 years later by @entity75 industrialist @entity74			1
but @entity74 appears to have been told it was a forgery , or at least wrongly attributed – so he banished it to the attic			2
@entity78 director @entity22 , left , and senior researcher @entity79 , right , unveiled the newly discovered ' @entity27 at @entity80 ' by @entity15 painter @entity12 during a press conference at the museum in @entity83 , today first public viewing : members of the press got their first glimpse of the newest @entity12 discovery - a scene from near the artist 's home at the time in @entity92 , @entity19 in 1991 , the anonymous owners of the painting contacted the @entity78 in @entity83 for its opinion - but experts rejected it , partly because it was unsigned			1
yesterday the same museum announced that an intensive , two - year investigation had concluded it was genuine after all			2
chemical analysis of paint pigments showed them to be identical to those @entity12 used , and x-ray examination of the canvas matched it to other paintings he did the same month			2
unveiling the privately - owned work before it goes on show for a year , museum director @entity107 described the discovery as ‘ a once in a lifetime experience ’			2
it was a painting from a time that many considered to be ‘ the culmination of his achievement ’ , he said			1
in the same period while living in in @entity92 , @entity117 , he painted ‘ @entity118 ’ , ‘ the bedroom ’ and many of his most famous ‘ @entity122 ’ series			2
@entity12 sold only one painting while he was alive and his work was only beginning to win acclaim when he died			1
today he is one of the world ’s most celebrated artists and his paintings are among the most sought after on the rare occasions they appear at auction			2
in 1987 , ‘ @entity122 ’ sold for nearly £ 25million			2
when he painted that one , however , he took the trouble to sign it			2
a world of brilliant colour : @entity12 painted this self - portrait in 1887 @entity12 was a @entity15 post-impressionist painter whose work is most renowned for its bold colours , strong and heavy brush strokes and rough beauty			1
in his youth he worked as an art dealer in @entity144 , @entity145 and the @entity146			2
he was also a teacher in @entity147 and later he worked as a missionary in @entity149 , where he would sketch people from the mining community			2
from a young age , @entity12 showed a flare for drawing but it was n't until he was in his late 20s that he began painting professionally			1
his first major work was completed in 1885 , titled ' @entity158 '			2
a year later he moved to @entity145 and lived with his brother @entity58 , where he became immersed in the world of the @entity19 impressionists			0
he met and mingled with other like - minded artists at @entity165 's studio , including @entity168 - @entity167 artist @entity166 , @entity169 , @entity170 , and @entity171			1
towards the end of his time in @entity145 , he becamse friends with @entity175 , who was new to the city and soon after , @entity12 organised a joint exhibition with @entity178 and others at an exclusive new resaurant			0
works by @entity12 , @entity175 , @entity169 , @entity170 , and probably @entity171 all featured at the @entity182 , in @entity183			0
@entity169 wrote of the event : ' @entity186 a new restaurant was opened			0
@entity12 used to eat there			0
he proposed to the manager that an exhibition be held there ...			0
canvases by @entity170 , by @entity193 , by @entity194 ... filled the hall ...			0
' it really had the impact of something new ; it was more modern than anything that was made in @entity145 at that moment ' after a two - year stint in the city , @entity12 moved to the south of @entity19 where , surrounded by vibrant colours and beautiful light his palette took on a more vivid shade			0
it was during his stay in @entity92 , in the south west of the country , from 1888 - 1889 , that his most recognisable style was developed			1
sunflowers became the subject matter synonymous with @entity12 he frequently painted self portraits , landscapes and still lifes			0
but perhaps his most famous subject matter were sunflowers in a vase			0
in preparation for a visit from his friend @entity175 , @entity12 painted a new sunflowers piece especially			0
he wanted the two to live and work together			0
the @entity19 stayed several months but their relationship deteriorated			0
@entity12 found @entity175 dominating and felt frustrated he was not treated like an equal			0
after an argument , @entity12 stormed out to a brothel with a razor blade and sliced off part of his ear			0
while in hospital , @entity175 returned to @entity145			0
in the last months of his life , the artists grew increasingly troubled and by early 1890 , was struggling to work			0
he had been plagued by mental health problems throughout his life and suffered agonising depression , loneliness and self - doubt as well as episodes of hallucination			0
at the age of 37 , @entity12 is believed to have shot himself in the chest			0
experts still speculate over the incident as the gun , a revolver , was never found			0
however , the wound was to prove fatal and the artist died with his beloved brother @entity58 at his side			1
@entity12 had created more than 2,100 artworks in his short life but had only sold one painting			1
in the wake of his death , interest exploded			0
memorial shows were held around the world and his work exchanged hands for vast sums of money			0
he is now recognised as one of the greatest artists of all time and his paintings sell for millions .			0

' @entity27 ' was *previously* rejected as a fake because it does not have a signature
@entity15 @entity78 now says evidence from letters , its style and materials prove it 's an original
painting came from a @entity75 man who kept it in his loft because he did not think it was authentic
