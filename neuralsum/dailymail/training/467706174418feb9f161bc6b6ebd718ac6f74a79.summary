smoking marijuana can give men ' man boobs ' , an @entity5 plastic surgeon claims writing for @entity23 , dr @entity6 explained that when the balance is in favour of oestrogen , instead of testosterone , extra breast tissue is created - and that cannabis can help tip the balance			1
dr @entity6 says ‘ moobs ’ – technically known as gynaecomastia – affect about 33 to 41 per cent of men aged 25 to 44			1
he says the condition also affects as many as 60 per cent of teenage boys and 55 to 60 per cent of over- 50s			0
most cases of ‘ moobs ’ resolve themselves within a couple of years but the removal of extra breast tissue is now the fifth most common plastic surgery choice for men in the @entity5 ' man boobs ' are caused by an imbalance in the body 's testosterone and oestrogen levels - and cannabis can cause testosterone levels to fall dr @entity6 says that in animals , marijuana results in falling testosterone levels , shrinking testicles and abnormalities in sperm			1

dr @entity6 says ' moobs ' are caused by an imbalance in levels of testosterone and oestrogen - cannabis causes testosterone levels to fall
smoking cannabis could also cause men 's testicles to shrink and their sperm to develop abnormalities , he says
