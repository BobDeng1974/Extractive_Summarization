the same court ruled that @entity15 's sufferer @entity6 , right , should be sent to @entity11 despite evidence he may kill himself @entity27 judges said a sex offenders ' programme in @entity30 may have breached his human rights			1
last night @entity6 ’s mother , @entity5 , condemned the decision			1
‘ it ’s a scandal this man has had his extradition refused by a @entity4 court , while my son who has been declared unfit for trial and at extreme risk of suicide by a @entity44 - approved expert in assessing risk is still waiting , ’ she said			1
‘ ten years have passed waiting for his trauma and torment to come to an end			0
’ @entity49 , who was extradited to the @entity11 as one of the @entity49 and has since written a book on extradition titled a @entity53 to pay , said : ‘ this case reveals at its starkest the idiocy of our extradition laws			2
‘ it is shocking we continue to see a string of extradition cases of ordinary @entity4 citizens who have ostensibly none of the human rights that are now being invoked for a heavyweight criminal			1
’ the @entity4 can not boot out @entity12 , who is a joint @entity11 / @entity65 citizen , because of his @entity67 citizenship and his marriage to a @entity69 – a senior @entity71 official he met in jail			1
fuming : @entity6 's mother @entity5 , pictured , condemned the decision last night , describing it as ' a scandal ' he is wanted by the authorities in @entity30 over claims he raped a 14 - year - old girl and molested two 11 - year - olds almost two decades ago			1
an arrest warrant was issued in 1994 when a woman and her cousin accused him of exposing himself and sexually assaulting them in the city of @entity84			0
his 14 - year - old alleged victim claims he plied her with alcohol and raped her when she passed out in the back of his car			0
@entity12 fled to @entity65 where he married			0
while his @entity65 wife was pregnant , he was accused of sexually assaulting two 12 - year - old girls in @entity91			0
he pleaded guilty but walked free with only a five - year suspended jail sentence , the @entity65 authorities being unaware of the @entity11 allegations			2
@entity12 then used his @entity65 ancestry to obtain an @entity65 passport in the name @entity98 and went on the run around @entity100 for more than a decade			0
in 2007 he was arrested in @entity101 – but not detained – when he used an identity card with the original spelling of his name			0
controversial : @entity12 , who is one of @entity11 's most wanted men , will be allowed to stay in the @entity4 with his partner , 34 - year - old @entity71 policy manager @entity106 , pictured the following year , @entity18 added him to its most - wanted list and , when he moved to @entity108 , he was picked up by the @entity109 in june 2010			1
he was living in @entity110 , @entity111 , with @entity106 , a 34 - year - old @entity71 policy manager			0
since then he has been fighting extradition under a @entity4 - @entity11 treaty that usually makes it very hard for any case to be thrown out			1
however his lawyers argued that sending him to @entity30 would be unfair because he might be placed on a life - long sex offender programme without even being convicted			2
on june 20 , @entity119 and mr @entity120 agreed , saying there was a real risk @entity12 would be subjected to an order of civil commitment in ‘ flagrant denial ’ of his human rights			2
article 5 of the @entity128 gives the right to liberty , unless removed by fair legal @entity131 said a criminal conviction was not necessary for enlistment on the programme – credible evidence of misconduct would do			0
@entity12 ’s lawyer , @entity136 , said no one had been taken off @entity30 ’s sex offender treatment programme since it was revised in 1988			1
the two judges gave the @entity11 government a last opportunity to provide an assurance that no commitment order would be made			0
no such undertaking has been received and consequently @entity12 ’s appeal under the @entity147 was allowed yesterday			0
@entity148 , appearing for the @entity11 government , had told the court that although @entity12 did not meet the programme ’s criteria there was no guarantee he would not be put on it			1
@entity12 was on remand in a category a prison in november 2010 when he wed @entity156 in a civil ceremony witnessed by two prison officers			0
a judge later bailed @entity12 with an electronic tag			0
he will now be freed without any tag , or supervision , and will be required only to go on the sex offenders register			2
a @entity44 spokesman said : ‘ the court has found in this specific case that the possibility of civil commitment in @entity30 , following any custodial sentence , would breach mr @entity12 ’s human rights			1
‘ the @entity11 has declined to provide assurances that he would not be subject to civil commitment			0
that is a matter for the @entity11			0
‘ this aspect of mr @entity12 ’s appeal was not against the decision of the @entity176 to sign the extradition order			2
’ @entity4 courts have ruled 46 - year - old @entity6 from @entity179 – wanted by the @entity11 for hacking into military computers while searching for evidence of ‘ little green men ’ – could be bundled off to @entity11			1
