police believe that a great grandmother with no known enemies or criminal links was deliberately targeted by a killer who shot her at point - blank range in the doorway of her western @entity8 home			1
despite this , detectives are still yet to identify who was responsible for the execution - style murder in november			2
@entity13 , 75 , was found dead in her home in @entity15 on november 20 , around 16 hours after her death			1
she had been shot in the head just prior to 6pm on november 19 , with forensics ruling that the bullet passed through the screen door before striking her			1

@entity27 , 75 , was shot in the head at the front door of her home in @entity8 's western suburbs			1
police are baffled by her killing two months later many had come to the conclusion that it must have been a random attack or a case of mistaken identity			0

' mrs @entity13 ’s front door was open , but her screen door was shut , so we think she might have answered a knock at the door			1
' she had lived at this address for more than 30 years and had strong links with her neighbours and a local bowling club			0
' we are , frankly , at a loss as to why someone would want to target her			0

' ' i 've only been here 12 months but @entity13 was a very well - liked lady , played bowls , we still do n't know why , ' ms @entity108 told @entity117			2
' what i do know is she was a lovely person and i really loved playing bowls with her			0
each week we 'd have a different partner but i loved playing with her			0
' ' i loved playing bowls with her ' : @entity122 developed ' many strong friendships ' as vice president of the @entity125 for the past 14 years mrs @entity13 's next - door neighbour of 14 years , @entity126 , says she called the police after hearing a shot on the day that the 75 - year - old was killed			1

' there was no trouble before that - very quiet , even the dog was not barking , ' he said			0
' she lived alone , her partner passed away a few years ago			0
' we would just meet and say hello when we collect the rubbish bins and bills - we would say " hello , how are you ? she was very friendly , yes			0
' when the 75 - year - old was found dead , another resident on the street , @entity78 , said neighbours were in shock			1
' yes it 's terribly sad but as residents we 're not really speaking about it out of respect for @entity13 , ' she said			0
' not that we know anything really anyway , to offer anything new			0
' it 's understood that mrs @entity13 , who has lived alone for several years , could have been dead for up to 16 hours before she was found behind her front door			1
@entity79 was found by a friend and member the @entity159 , where she had been a member for more than 20 years a week after her death , the @entity104 and @entity105 released a statement to confirm that mrs @entity13 was found by a concerned friend and club member who noted her absence at a recent event			1

she was a committed member volunteering her time to co-ordinate the ladies activities and formed many strong friendships within the club , ' the statement read			0
' the club 's community is shocked and dismayed at the circumstances surrounding @entity13 ’s death and can not understand how a respected senior citizen and friend could come to harm in her own home			2
