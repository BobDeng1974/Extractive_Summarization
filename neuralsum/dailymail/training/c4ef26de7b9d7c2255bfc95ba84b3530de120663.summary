by @entity0 and @entity1 and @entity2 tories accused church leaders of playing politics last night for using their @entity7 messages to attack the government over poverty and ‘ sinful ’ cuts			1
in his sermon , the archbishop of @entity12 highlighted the plight of struggling families ‘ left broken and weeping ’ by hunger and debt			1
he told the congregation at @entity20 : ‘ in this country , even as the economy improves there is weeping in broken families , in people ashamed to seek help from food banks , or frightened by debt			1
’ the archbishop of canterbury @entity29 said in his sermon : ' even as the economy improves there is weeping in broken families ' and the @entity33 the right reverend @entity34 spoke of the ‘ sinful consequences ’ of the squeeze on local authority budgets			1
the bishop , who sits on a committee looking at food banks , told @entity41 : ‘ politicians have to decide how to allocate resources			2
and in allocating some resources , you are then inevitably taking away from other people			2
@entity48 mp @entity47 said last night : ' of course church leaders can comment on politics , but they should get an appropriate balance ' ‘ i am not saying it ’s a sin			2
i am saying that some of these policies lead to effects and consequences which have sinful elements in them			1
’ the bishops ’ comments come amid growing unease over the use of political messages by figures in the @entity65			0
last week saw a letter signed by 600 church leaders , including 36 @entity65 bishops , calling on the government to tackle what it called a ‘ national crisis ’ of hunger and poverty			1
the letter cited the rise of food banks as evidence that ‘ unfair and harsh benefits sanctions ’ were causing people to go hungry			0
but the claims contradict findings by the @entity83 showing food poverty in @entity85 has reduced			0
many argue there will always be an almost unlimited demand for food that is given away for free and that it does not necessarily mean people are going hungry			0
last night @entity48 mp @entity47 , chairman of the @entity92 , said : ‘ i do n’t remember church leaders in years gone by talking about the huge debt mountain this government inherited , or talking positively about the number of people now back in work			1
‘ of course church leaders can comment on politics , but they should get an appropriate balance			0
@entity105 ’s statement that @entity85 is a @entity106 country risks dividing society , a group of leading public figures has warned			0
more than 50 writers , scientists , broadcasters and academics have signed an open letter expressing concern at the ‘ negative consequences ’ of his assertion			1
signatories include authors @entity118 and sir @entity120 , broadcasters @entity121 and @entity123 , philosopher @entity124 , and human rights activist @entity125			0
last week the prime minister wrote in the @entity127 of his own faith and his desire to infuse politics with @entity106 ideals and values			0
but the letter says : ‘ repeated surveys , polls , and studies show most of us as individuals are not @entity106 in our beliefs or our religious identities ... to constantly claim otherwise fosters alienation and division in our society			0
’ ' it cheapens the message of @entity7 if you engage in party politics			0
’ fellow @entity149 @entity148 , the mp for @entity150 , said : ‘ you ca n’t criticise debt from the pulpit and then have a go at a government that is trying to do something about it			1
’ archbishop @entity29 left himself open to accusations of hypocrisy after it emerged yesterday that the @entity65 still has financial interests in @entity162			1
the archbishop lambasted the payday loan company last year , only for it to be revealed that the church ’s pension fund had invested money in one of the high - interest lender ’s financial backers			2
church commissioners continue to hold shares in the firm worth around £ 90,000			0
but in a newspaper interview on saturday archbishop @entity29 dismissed the issue , saying he had not acted because he had ‘ a million other things to do ’ and was not an ‘ investment manager ’ .			2
