by @entity1 medical correspondent published : 18:23 est , 1 april 2013 updated : 02:42 est , 2 april 2013 bowel cancer rates among men have soared by more than a quarter in the last 35 years , new figures have revealed			2
but the rise among women is far lower , at around six per cent			1
a report from @entity8 says reasons for the widening gap in disease rates between the sexes remains a mystery , although it is replicated in other countries			1
bowel cancer is linked to lifestyle factors such as obesity and diets high in red and processed meat and low in fibre			1
but some experts believe the link with obesity seems to be stronger in men			1
bowel cancer rates among men have soared by more than a quarter in the last 35 years , new figures have revealed bowel cancer is the second most common cause of cancer death in the @entity28 after lung cancer			2
incidence of the disease has climbed from 45 cases per 100,000 men in 1975 - 77 to 58 cases in 2008 - 10 , a rise of 29 per cent , said the report			1
over the same time period , rates for women have increased only slightly from 35 to 37 per 100,000			2
the biggest rise was seen among people aged in their 60s and 70s , who now account for 23,000 new cases each year			1
however , bowel cancer survival is improving , with half of all patients living for at least 10 years after being diagnosed			0
the figures are released to mark bowel cancer awareness month and the launch of a new campaign by the @entity51			0
professor @entity52 , from the @entity53 , who is director of the @entity55 , said : ‘ we know the risk of bowel cancer increases as we get older and , since we ’re all living longer , it ’s no surprise to see that the number of people getting the disease is rising			1
‘ but when we look at these figures and take people ’s age into account , we still see that the risk of bowel cancer has gone up in men in the last 35 years			1
it ’s important to find out what ’s behind the rise and what we can do about it ‘ the good news is that , thanks to research , we have seen huge improvements in bowel cancer survival over the last 40 years			0
smoking , an inactive lifestyle , heavy alcohol intake of more than 4 drinks a day also increase the risk of bowel cancer ‘ it ’s this research that ’s led to better drugs to treat the disease , improved surgical techniques , the use of more radiotherapy and the introduction of bowel screening to spot the disease earlier , when it is most effectively treated			0
’ around 42,000 cases of the disease are diagnosed annually in @entity91 , including 18,500 in women and 23,000 in men			1
three - quarters of cases are found in people aged 65 and over , and the increasing age of the population is a major reasons for rising rates			0
smoking , an inactive lifestyle , heavy alcohol intake of more than 4 drinks a day also increase the risk of bowel cancer			0
dr @entity105 , senior science information manager at @entity8 , said : ‘ bowel cancer survival rates have doubled over the last 40 years and our work is at the heart of this progress			1
’ she said the newly introduced @entity112 national bowel screening programme had played an important role by picking up cancers early , when treatment is more likely to succeed			0
@entity116 founded the @entity51 in partnership with @entity8 after her football star husband died of bowel cancer in 1993			2
to date , the fund has raised around £ 20 million for research and awareness projects			0
mrs @entity116 said : ‘ it ’s good to see that despite the rise in incidence , bowel cancer survival is improving			0
however , it ’s vital we continue to fund research to fight this disease as these new statistics show			0
‘ bowel cancer is the second most common cause of cancer death in the @entity28 , after lung cancer			0
' finding a way to beat bowel cancer has been my goal for the past two decades and my hope is that by increasing awareness and helping to fund @entity8 ’s vital research , many more lives can be saved from this terrible disease in the future			1
’ the new ‘ @entity149 ’ campaign will encourage people to spread the word about the disease and raise funds			2
it is especially aimed at the football community , as men are more likely to suffer from bowel cancer .			0

but the rise among women is just 6 per cent , says @entity8
the biggest rise was seen among people in their 60s and 70s
disease is linked to factors such a lack of fibre and too much red meat
some experts also believe the link with obesity seems to be stronger in men
