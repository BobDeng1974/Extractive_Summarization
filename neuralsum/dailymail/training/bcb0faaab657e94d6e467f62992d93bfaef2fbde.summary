by @entity0 a former high - flying police officer has told how her life spiraled into a hellish nightmare of drugs , prostitution and despair after she became hooked on ultra-addictive methamphetamine			1
@entity9 was a rising star in the @entity10 , regularly teaming up with @entity12 officers to fly helicopter missions searching for drugs or breaking down doors to bust big - time dealers			1
but every night she would return to her apartment , pull out a meth pipe and a bag of illegal drugs and smoke herself into delirium , a hopeless junkie in the grips of a deadly habit			1
iced : @entity24 , left , when she was a promising young officer in the @entity25 and , right , at the time of her arrest after years of methamphetamine addiction in a new tell - all book , @entity9 has revealed how her addiction got so bad she turned to prostitution and ended up lying to colleagues claiming she had ovarian cancer in order to explain her drug - ravaged her appearance			1
in a frank interview with the @entity38 , @entity9 told how she first tried meth in her mid- 20s after being given a small bag of the highly - addictive drug by a fellow officer in order to file a report on			1
@entity24 's new memoir shards tells of her descent into drug addiction she had just undergone an abortion after falling pregnant with twins following an affair with a married work colleague and was struggling with depression			1
she told the newspaper : ' i sat in my bedroom with the blinds drawn and stared at the baggy			2
i was so desperate for anything to make me feel better			2
and it would just be this one time			2
' i poured out a few of the clear , tiny crystals , and even though you ’re supposed to smoke it , i snorted it			0
i felt it burn in my nostrils and my eyes teared up			0
but then , i felt the most amazing , ecstatic high i ’d ever felt			1
my life felt livable ; i felt happy			0
' at first @entity9 tried to justify her drug use by buying her own supply and not stealing it from work			1
because she was so well known as a vice cop in @entity74 , she would fly to @entity75 once a month and get a local prostitute to take her to a dealer			0
she would then walk through customs brazenly carrying the drugs in her pocket , knowing that as a police officer it would be unlikely she would be searched			1
after a matter of months , @entity9 had spent her entire $ 35,000 savings on plane tickets and meth - but by now she was addicted and began stealing drugs from work , skimming small amounts from seizures			1
in an attempt to cover up the devastating effect meth was having on her appearance she would wear contact lenses to hide her dilated pupils and binge on fast food and body - building supplements in a bid to keep her weight up			1
but her drug use was out of control			0
she was using around a gram a day , regularly sneaking off to the bathroom to take a hit before returning to her desk			0
soon she had lost some 20 pounds and ended up lying to her colleagues , claiming she ovarian cancer			1
now on sick leave she fell even further into the grip of the ultra - addictive methamphetamine			1
she moved in with her sister in @entity112 , sitting in her bedroom smoking and injecting drugs with two young infants in the other room			2
disgraced : @entity24 was jailed for a year after pleading guilty to 25 drug - related charges including deceiving the department , tampering with evidence , drug possession and forging doctors ' notes soon she was turning to prostitution to feed her habit , scouring the @entity126 website to find men willing to trade drugs for sex			1
incredibly no one suspected anything			0
her work colleagues even got in contact to say they had donated their sick leave so she could have as much time as she needed to beat cancer			1
referred to as ‘ ice ’ or ‘ glass ’ , methylamphetamine can be consumed orally , sniffed , smoked or injected			0
in its most popular crystalline form it resembles glass shavings or a crystal rock but is also available in pills and powder			0
the drug is generally odourless although some forms have strong ammonia smell , because of solvents used to make it			0
at low doses crystal meth boosts alertness and blocks hunger and fatigue			2
higher doses of the drug causes exhilaration and euphoria and very high doses cause agitation and paranoia			2
side effects include anxiety , emotional swings , and paranoia and there is a risk of fever , convulsions , and falling into a coma			0
death can result from burst blood vessels in the brain ( triggered by spikes in blood pressure ) or heart failure			0
the high from the drug tends to last 4 - 12 hours with users continuing to take the drug for days - sometimes addicts stay awake for days , eat very little and experience a heightened state of arousal			1
the drug was first synthesised in 1919 but has grown in popularity due to the ease with which it is produced using a number of household products and items			0
one of her closest workmates even organised a fund - raiser to pay for the chemotherapy she was supposedly having			1
but even that did n't stop her and she moved to @entity197 to stay with a dealer she had met on @entity126			0
after discovering she was a police officer , the dealer secretly filmed her taking drugs and having sex and blackmailed her , confiscating her badge and drivers licence so she could not escape			1
she was regularly beaten and on one occasion after they had argued , he brought a group of men over to the house to gang - rape her			2
eventually she managed to escape , getting her mother to come and collect her and going into rehab			0
finally off the drugs she moved back in with her mother in @entity216			2
but her past soon caught up with her and she was arrested and transported back to @entity74 in handcuffs and leg clamps to face 25 drug - related charges including deceiving the department , tampering with evidence , drug possession and forging doctors ’ notes			2
she pleaded guilty to all charges and spent a year in jail			2
now clean and living with her grandmother in @entity229 , she works three jobs to make ends meet			0
she added : ' i still have meth cravings , even though i ’ve been clean for four - and - a - half years			1
and i have nightmares about the dealer every single night			0
i see a therapist three times a week , three hours a visit			0
' i try not to look too far ahead into the future , but my goal is to learn how to accept myself			0
my biggest regret besides hurting the people that i loved so much is that i did n’t love myself			0
