by @entity0 these incredible images show how the biggest and brightest moon for 20 years lit up the sky last night			0
the ' supermoon ' appeared 16 per cent bigger and 30 per cent brighter than normal as it reached the point in its orbit closest to the @entity7 , known as ' perigee '			1
many enthusiasts grabbed their mobile phones to take a snapshot of the glimmering spectacle - which also came at the start of the @entity14 meteor shower			0
stargazers around the world , including in @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity21 , looked up into the night sky to catch a glimpse of the phenomenon			2
@entity25 , which are known to cause higher tides , occur every 13 months and 18 days , but are not always noticed because of cloudy weather			0
last night it was just 221,765 miles from @entity7 this year there are five supermoons , two new moons in january and full moons in july , august and september			1
the spectacular glow created by the bright moon sparked a deluge of comments on @entity36 over night			2
one user said he was ' dumbstruck ' by the spectacle while another wrote : ' check out the supermoon			0
hopefully it 's clear where you are			0
it looks amazing here around @entity46			0
it is pictured here behind the @entity52 in @entity17 glowing : the night sky almost appeared blue as it glimmered over @entity69			0
the light can be seen reflecting off the sea in this spectacular night shot of @entity73 blue moon : a stargazer tries to take an amateur snap of the supermoon using a mobile phone device while the sky around it in @entity17 appears to turn blue the full moon was a bright presence in the @entity17 night sky and many lit up many of the capital 's greatest buildings and monuments , including the @entity52 , pictured a supermoon occurs when the moon is both ' full ' and at its closest point to @entity7			1
astronomers call this phenomenon a ' perigee moon , ' which describes the full moon that occurs when the moon is at its closest point to @entity7 each year			1
@entity96 marks the closest point a body reaches as it orbits around its host object such as @entity7 , while apogee marks the farthest point from its parent body			1
almost every orbit has an apogee and perigee because orbits tend to be elliptical rather than perfectly circular , so even @entity7 has an apogee and perigee around the sun. last night the supermoon was 16 per cent bigger and 30 per cent brighter as it passed @entity7 221,765 miles away			1
although they occur every 13 months and 18 days , they are not always noticed because of cloudy weather			0
this year there are five supermoons , two new moons in january and full moons in july , august and september			1
a perigee full moon , also called ' supermoon ' , glows as it looms behind the @entity119 in @entity18			2
this image was taken from from @entity121 , @entity122 the moon glows orange behind the famous skyscrapers of @entity18			0
@entity25 , which are known to cause higher tides , occur every 13 months and 18 days it 's @entity127 : the supermoon is seen as it rises through the clouds behind the bronze @entity130 by @entity132 in @entity133 , @entity134 the supermoon rises behind the light on top of the @entity138 in @entity139 , @entity140			0
this year there are five supermoons , two new moons in january and full moons in july , august and september			1
a supermoon rises behind @entity146 in @entity147 , @entity148			0
the astronomical event occurs when the moon is closest to the @entity7 in its orbit , making it appear much larger and brighter than usual with its craters clearly visible and glowing yellow , the supermoon rises over @entity156 words reading ' @entity156 construction ' in @entity19 fireworks streak past in front of the supermoon outside the town of @entity162 , celebrating the feast of its patron saint , in central @entity165 the supermoon appeared almost pink in colour as it glowed above @entity168 in @entity169			1
@entity25 , which are known to cause higher tides , occur every 13 months and 18 days , but are not always noticed because of cloudy weather the full moon descends behind the @entity173 in @entity21 , @entity174			2
in this time of the year the orb is at the closest point to the earth this shot of the moon appeared behind a @entity181 fighting bull in @entity182 , @entity181			2
the phenomenon , which scientists call a perigee moon , occurs when the moon is near the horizon a supermoon rises over the @entity189 on @entity191 's @entity190 as seen from @entity192 , @entity193 stargazers around the world looked up into the nightsky to catch a glimpse of the supermoon , including in @entity199 , @entity200 where this spectacular picture was taken			1

the supermoon appears when the moon reaches the closest point in its orbit to @entity7
known as ' perigee ' , it seems 16 per cent bigger and 30 per cent bright than normal
stargazers from across the world *shared* their photographs of the phenomenon
in 2014 there are two new moons in january and full moons in july , august and september
