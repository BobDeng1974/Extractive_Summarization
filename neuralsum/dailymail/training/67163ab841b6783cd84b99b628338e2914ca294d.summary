by @entity0 while most @entity3 were spending @entity4 settling in for the @entity6 long weekend , one group of committed drinkers spent their day loutishly terrorising a @entity8 neighbourhood instead			1
a video uploaded to @entity10 last wednesday by @entity12 student @entity11 , 22 , shows the men drunkenly cycling from house to house in an event they called the ‘ @entity17 ’			1
visiting seven houses on their all - day drinking endeavour , the almost 80 men reportedly consumed 1,600 beers – an average of 20 each			1
their ' tour ' started with the men converging on their bicycles at one participant ’s house , where they poured wine from a cask into one anothers mouths			0
at another early point in their tour , a smaller group of men can be seen pouring beer onto one participant ’s hairy breasts and drinking it from his bare skin			1
watch out for stray hairs : a @entity27 participant drinks beer off a fellow participant 's bare chest goon of death : one tour @entity63 participant pours wine from a cask into another participant 's mouth as the day progressed , some of the men began removing their clothing and jumping into swimming pools			2
being so intoxicated that they were vomiting was n’t even enough to deter some of them – merely serving as an opportunity to empty their stomachs so they could drink more			0
it might seem like harmless fun to some , but the group appear to be showing no concern for the safety of local residents who may have come across the group			0
cooling off : onlookers cheer as participants endanger others by jumping on top of them in an inflatable swimming pool wrestling each other to the ground : @entity27 participants are seen wrestling each other to the ground during one of their pit stops converging at a skateboarding park , intended for residents of the community to enjoy during the daytime – the men continued to put themselves at risk by jumping on tour participants as they attempted to perform bicycle tricks			2
even potentially getting an infringement from police was n’t enough to deter some of the rowdy revellers – with some participants continuing to drink alcohol during the ride on to the next house			0
@entity114 has sought comment from @entity116 and the @entity117 .			0
