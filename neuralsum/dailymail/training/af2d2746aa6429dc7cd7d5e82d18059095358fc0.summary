mr @entity8 , a high - profile solicitor known as ‘ @entity8 ’ , has won acquittals for celebrity clients including sir @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 and @entity34			1

mr @entity8 told the court rabbi @entity0 would have been been ‘ invisible ’ on the rainy winter ’s night due to his traditional all - black orthodox jewish clothing			1
he added that pedestrians like him would be safer if they wore ‘ something reflective that would give them a visible presence , such as a vest , armbands or belt ’			0
mr loophole @entity8 ( left ) and his client @entity1 ( right ) who mowed down an 82 - year - old rabbi mr @entity8 said : ‘ pedestrians along with motorists and cyclists all share road space , and in my view therefore must assume some responsibility to ensure their visibility			1
‘ sadly , because he was “ invisible ” , mr @entity0 has lost his life			0
’ however his comments were yesterday labelled ‘ nonsense ’ by the rabbi ’s son - in - law , 63 - year - old @entity60 , who added he had been shocked driver @entity1 had n’t been jailed			1
‘ what mr @entity8 has said is ridiculous and insensitive , ’ said mr @entity60 , who is himself a solicitor and witnessed the collision			2
‘ had my father - in - law been wearing pink , white and blue flashing lights , it would not have made the slightest bit of difference because he was practically on the pavement and he still got hit			0
the driver was just driving carelessly			0
‘ i ’m sure when mr @entity8 goes to court each day he wears a blue or black suit			2
does he wear reflective clothing ? ’ rabbi @entity0 had been walking to his local synagogue in @entity81 , @entity78 in december 2012 and had ‘ almost got to the pavement ’ when he was hit and flung into the air , @entity78 @entity4 was told this week			1
@entity1 , 24 , had been doing up to 42mph on a 30mph road and had sent a text message from behind the wheel just minutes before he hit the rabbi , who had 54 grandchildren			1

afterwards mr @entity8 said he was n’t suggesting ‘ everyone must wear a hi - viz jacket ’ but that pedestrians could do more to protect themselves at @entity109 added : ‘ i expected the driver to go down for a few years as a deterrent for others , i am surprised by this sentence			2

@entity121 transport spokesman @entity120 – mp for the @entity78 constituency of @entity124 – is now calling for the sentence to be reviewed , saying it set a ‘ dangerous precedent ’			0
and he criticised mr @entity8 ’s comments , saying : ‘ as well as being culturally insensitive , the incident was clearly the fault of the speeding driver			2
’ but the solicitor hit back , accusing the politician of political point - scoring and saying ministers should do more to encourage pedestrians to make themselves visible at night			0
‘ my comments are pertinent to men and women of all colours and creeds , and in case he is not aware i too am @entity118 , so i ’m hardly likely to denigrate my own culture , ’ mr @entity8 added .			0
