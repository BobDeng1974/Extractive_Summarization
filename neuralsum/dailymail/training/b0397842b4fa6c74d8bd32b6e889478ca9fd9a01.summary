by @entity0 published : 17:00 est , 9 march 2013 updated : 17:00 est , 9 march 2013 he has entertained everyone from @entity3 and @entity5 ’s @entity4 to the @entity6			2
but today , tv magician @entity7 is giving a less starry but no less special private performance at a @entity11 hotel to seven - year - old @entity12 and his parents			1
best known for ‘ walking on water ’ across the @entity15 in 2011 , @entity7 is here as an ambassador for @entity17 , a charity that grants wishes to seriously ill children			1
he has surprised his young fan @entity22 – who has cystic fibrosis , an incurable genetic disease that affects the respiratory and digestive systems – with a visit			1
tricking pain : street magician @entity7 , real name @entity30 , began to display the first signs of @entity34 's disease at the age of 13 at one point , the 30 - year - old entertainer holds a 10p piece – donated by @entity22 ’s father @entity39 – in the palm of his upturned hand and hovers his other hand about 12in over it			1
in a split - second , the coin appears to levitate and then disappears			0
we stare in disbelief as the magician points to a table a few feet away , where the coin now is			2
‘ @entity52 ! ’ exclaims @entity22			0
over the next 30 minutes , @entity7 reads @entity22 ’s mind , turns lottery tickets into wads of cash and makes playing cards appear out of nowhere			1
@entity22 is spellbound by the performance , and clearly rather starstruck – and i do n’t blame him			0
spooky is the best word to describe the whole experience			0
rays of @entity64 is a cause close to @entity7 ’s heart , because he knows what it ’s like to be in @entity22 ’s shoes : he has suffered from the incurable digestive condition @entity71 since childhood , which meant long stretches in hospital or at home recovering from bouts of illness or surgery			1
‘ being really unwell when you ’re young can be very isolating , not to mention boring , ’ says @entity7 , real name @entity30			1
his own problems began aged 13 when all his friends seemed to experience a growth spurt but he stayed the same size			1
even now he is just 5ft 6in and weighs only 8st			0
giving back : @entity7 performs card tricks to entertain fan @entity22 who has cystic fibrosis ‘ i remember feeling like a laboratory experiment because i had to undergo all of these tests and no one could work out what was wrong with me , ’ he says			1
‘ it ’s an age when your confidence is knocked and it was hard being the odd one out			2
finally , when i was 15 , they discovered i had @entity71 ’s			1
’ it was learning magic that helped him through those tough times and he says performing tricks kept the bullies at bay			0
@entity71 ’s is a chronic condition which causes the lining of the digestive system to become inflamed and flare - ups are usually in the small or large @entity106 include diarrhoea , pain , fatigue and weight loss and , in the long term , the inflammation can result in additional complications , such as narrowing of the colon			1
it is n’t fully understood what causes it but genes , a faulty immune system and previous infection may play a role			2
there is no cure but there are medications to help control symptoms			0
in up to 75 per cent of cases , surgery will be needed to repair damaged parts of the digestive system			1
@entity7 underwent surgery to remove half of his stomach , due to a burst abscess , aged 19			1
the operation was a success but he endured months of painful recovery			0
he has spent a total of two years in hospital since being diagnosed , yet now has the condition under control , without medication , by eliminating foods that aggravate the condition			0
crippling : @entity30 is in constant pain and as a result of his illness is forced to avoid many foods considered ' healthy ' which makes him ill ‘ i was on 23 tablets a day and although some of the pain went , i ’d have horrible side - effects , ’ he says			1
‘ they would make me feel sleepy and spaced out which is n’t ideal when you ’re a magician and you need to be on the ball for tricks to work			2
‘ instead , i ’ve cut out all the “ healthy ” foods that actually make me ill – fruits , vegetables , anything fibrous – because they ’re hard to digest			0
now i live off chicken , mashed potato and pasta and have vitamin injections to make up for what my body is missing			0
having @entity71 ’s means i ca n’t absorb @entity172 so it ’s important i get that , too			1
’ although @entity7 is always in pain – likening the sensation to rubbing dirt in an open wound – he is upbeat			1
‘ my stomach constantly throbs but i ’m used to it now , ’ he says			0
‘ when you ’re busy you learn to ignore it , especially when you ’re entertaining people			0
’ and young @entity22 is certainly being entertained today			0
cystic fibrosis affects about 9,000 @entity184 and causes the lungs and digestive system to become clogged up with thick mucous			1
‘ he ’s a strong little boy , despite what he has to go through on a daily basis , ’ says his mother @entity188 , 38 , a healthcare manager from @entity189			2
‘ he has to do physiotherapy twice a day to keep his lungs clear and take so many drugs			0
’ @entity22 ’s condition rapidly declined last year , when his parents were told by doctors his lung function had declined to that of a 25 - year - old @entity201 suffer			2
the average life expectancy of a @entity201 sufferer is 30			0
‘ @entity22 being able to meet one of his heroes is a big deal for us , ’ says @entity39 , 33 , who works for @entity204			0
‘ he ’s been through a lot , so to see him so happy is priceless			2
’ to donate money to @entity17 , the charity that grants wishes for seriously ill children in the @entity204 aged between three and 18 , visit @entity213			0
