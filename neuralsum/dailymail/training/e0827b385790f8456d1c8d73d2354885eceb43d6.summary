a mountain - sized asteroid which passes @entity2 every three years has been discovered by a @entity4 scientist			1
@entity5 , a professor at @entity6 , said the space rock , named ' 2014 @entity8 ' , poses no immediate threat - although warned it could ' theoretically ' hit @entity2			1
. however , he said it highlights the damage an asteroid could cause - in this case an explosion 1,000 times greater than the surprise 2013 impact of a bus - sized meteor in @entity4			1
while the majority of the impacts occurred either high up in the atmosphere , or in unpopulated areas including the @entity38 and @entity37 , the danger was still ever present			0
the findings were based on information released from the @entity41			0
this operates a network of sensors that monitor @entity2 around the clock listening for the infrasound signatures of nuclear detonations			2
but what these sensors found were not nuclear explosions , but rather asteroid impacts on a huge scale			0
between 2000 and 2013 the network detected 26 explosions on @entity2 ranging in energy from one to 600 kilotons - all caused by asteroid impacts			1
at 400 - metres ( 1,300 feet ) in size , the space rock is about the same size as the @entity61 is tall			0
@entity62 said it is difficult to calculate the orbit of big rocks like ' 2014 @entity8 ' because their trajectories are constantly being changed by the gravitational pull of other planets ' we need to permanently track this asteroid , because even a small mistake in calculations could have serious consequences , ' he said			2
of 100,000 near - @entity2 objects which can cross our planet 's orbit and are large enough to be dangerous , only about 11,000 have so far been tracked and cataloged			1
' the exact path of the asteroid until 2014 @entity8 is impossible to determine , but in theory it can collide with the @entity2 , and @entity81 and @entity82 , ' the @entity6 said			1
however , @entity83 said the discovery posed no risk			0
' some recent press reports have suggested that an asteroid designated 2014 @entity8 , found on october 27 , 2014 , at the @entity90 observatory in @entity91 , @entity4 , represents an impact threat to the @entity2 , ' it said			1
' while this approximately 400 - meter sized asteroid has a three year orbital period around the sun and returns to the @entity2 's neighborhood periodically , it does not represent a threat because its orbital path does not pass sufficiently close to the @entity2 's orbit			1
' @entity102 , director of the @entity103 in @entity104 , has also re-computed this object 's orbit after noticing that it was the same as an object observed six years ago			1
using both sets of observations , the future motion of this asteroid was carried further forward in time using the automatic computations made by the @entity115 system at @entity83 's @entity116 at the @entity117			2
these computations rule out this object as an impact threat to @entity2 ( or any other planet ) for at least the next 150 years			1
last week astronomers and rockstars alike are joined forces to warn the world of the threat posed to the planet by asteroids			0
more than 100 leading scientists and astronauts from dr @entity129 to @entity130 have signed a declaration asking for increased action to tackle objects that could end life on @entity2			1
and in an event scheduled for 30 june 2015 , a live aid - style concert may be used to drum up support and tell the world just how much danger we are in - unless urgent measures are taken			0
at 400 - metres ( 1,300 feet ) in size , the space rock is about the same size as the @entity61 is tall , shown here towering above the @entity147 skyline more than 1,600 people were injured by the shock wave from the explosion of the @entity152 meteorite ( trail shown ) in february 2013 , estimated to be as strong as 20 @entity155 atomic bombs			1
it highlighted the threat @entity2 faces from incoming asteroids known as @entity160 , this global event is being timed to coincide with the anniversary of the tunguska event in @entity163 in 1908			2
this was the largest asteroid to impact @entity2 in recent history , and devastated an area about the size of a major metropolitan region - 800 square miles ( 2,000 square km )			1
live concerts , community events , lectures and other educational programmes are planned to call for the increased detection and mapping of asteroids			0
the signatories of the @entity178 say that available technology should be employed to detect , track and defend @entity2 from asteroid impacts			2
they include @entity183 astronomer royal lord @entity182 , evolutionary biologist @entity184 and tv presenter @entity185			0
the experts are calling for a 100-fold increase in the detection and monitoring of so - called near @entity2 objects ( @entity191 )			1
it is estimated that of the million or so asteroids that could cause major damage on @entity2 , we are aware of only about 10,000 - or one per cent			2
this means that at any moment an asteroid could enter the atmosphere and cause widespread destruction , without any prior knowledge			0
the possibility of this scenario has been repeatedly hinted at recently by meteorites and fireballs spotted in the sky			0
most notably , in february 2013 more than 1,600 people were injured when a meteor exploded near the city of @entity152 in @entity4 , the largest recorded meteor strike in more than a century			1
the signatories of the @entity178 say that available technology should be employed to detect , track and defend @entity2 from asteroid impacts			2
they include @entity183 astronomer royal lord @entity182 , evolutionary biologist @entity184 and tv presenter @entity185 ( pictured ) ' the more we learn about asteroid impacts , the clearer it becomes that the human race has been living on borrowed time , ' dr @entity129 said in a statement			0
' we are currently aware of less than one per cent of objects comparable to the one that impacted at @entity220 , and nobody knows when the next big one will hit			2
' it takes just one			0
' events , to be organised by individuals and independent organisations around the world on 30 june , will lead discussions on solutions to protect all of humanity from future asteroid impacts			0
' we have the technology to deflect dangerous asteroids through kinetic impactors and gravity tractors , but only if we have years of advance warning of their trajectories , ' stated former shuttle astronaut dr @entity238			2
' now we need the resolve to go forward			0
it is the only natural disaster we know how to prevent			0
' other experts pointed to the need to find hazardous asteroids through an accelerated search programme in order to prevent them causing destructive impacts on @entity2			0
at the moment @entity83 has a number of ground - based telescopes to detect objects that could cause widespread destruction , but experts have called for this to be significantly improved - including an infrared telescope between @entity2 and @entity82 to track incoming asteroids .			1

mountain - sized asteroid passes @entity2 every three years
could cause explosion 1,000 times greater than 2013 impact of a bus - sized meteor in @entity4 if it hit @entity2
of 100,000 near - @entity2 objects which can cross our planet 's orbit and are large enough to be dangerous , only about 11,000 have so far been tracked and cataloged
