giving prisoners the right to vote will do nothing to stop them reoffending @entity3 insisted today			1
the justice secretary claimed having a job and somewhere to live after leaving jail were more important factors in preventing them returning to a life of crime			1
and he vowed that the @entity12 parliament would be ‘ sovereign ’ in deciding whether to implement a controversial ruling from the @entity14 that inmates should be able to take part in elections			1
justice secretary @entity3 insisted there was no evidence giving prisoners the vote would stop them reoffending when they were released @entity23 judges have ruled that the @entity12 's blanket ban on votes for those behind bars is a breach of their human rights			1
in february 2012 the @entity30 called for the ban to be maintained by an overwhelming margin of 234 to 22 , despite repeated warnings from @entity34			2
since then ministers have published a draft bill on the issue , while stressing that the @entity12 @entity11 is ‘ sovereign ’ and it was up to mps to decide whether or not to comply with @entity14 rulings			1
the government has sought to kick the issue into the long grass , by investigating a raft of options including allowing prisoners to vote during the last six months of their sentence			0
mr @entity3 admitted the plan would be difficult to implement , because it is not always known so far in advance when a prisoner would be released			1
mr @entity3 repeatedly told the justice select committee : ' @entity11 is sovereign in these matters ' giving evidence to the justice select committee , mr @entity3 repeatedly rejected the idea that being allowed to vote in elections from behind bars would do anything to prevent them committing a crime again after release			1
@entity62 mp @entity61 pointed to @entity63 , where he claimed prisoners were given the vote ' as a process of giving them some small responsibility '			0
but mr @entity3 said : ‘ i have not seen any evidence that suggests to me that introduction of votes for prisoners would have any material effect on reoffending rates			1
‘ my experience is that a house and a job are much more important			2
’ the prisoner voting row has been running since 2005 , when @entity34 judges ordered @entity12 to give the vote to convicted prisoners , who have historically been considered to have removed themselves from the electorate			0
despite overwhelming votes in favour of maintaining the law in the @entity30 , the @entity23 judges have continued to repeat their instructions			0
a string of @entity88 - led by the prime minister - are resisting demands from the @entity14 for some inmates to be granted the right to vote in 2010 , @entity93 said it makes him ' physically ill ' to even contemplate having to give the vote to anyone in prison			1
in december last year the prime minister insisted @entity12 ' damned well should n't ' be forced to comply with the @entity23 judges			0
the government insists it is complying with the rule of law , despite delaying attempts to respond to the ruling			0
mr @entity3 added : ' the worst thing we could do is implement a change inappropriately			2
@entity11 is sovereign in these matters			0
‘ if we are to introduce votes for prisoners , it will have to be with the consent of @entity11			0
’ there are concerns that 2,300 compensation claims from prisons banned from voting have be reactivated by the ruling , costing the @entity12 taxpayer tens of thousands of pounds			2
but mr @entity3 said : ‘ the court has started that the process in a small number of cases			2
we do n’t intend to play an active part in the court			0
we do n’t believe that any compensation will be payable in the judgement , whatever the outcome			0

@entity3 rejects the idea of using votes as part of *rehabilitation*
claims there is no evidence letting inmates take part in elections will help
argues having somewhere to live and finding work is more important
@entity14 ruled against blanket ban on voting
