a medieval book that once belonged to @entity1 will go on public display for the first time today			2
the lavishly illustrated @entity4 , created in @entity5 around 1200 and first documented in the @entity6 at @entity7 in 1542 , is part of a new exhibition at @entity9			1
bestiaries were illustrated books of animals , some real and some mythological , used to provide @entity14 moral messages			1
detailed : the lavishly illustrated medieval book used animals , both mythological and real , as religious symbols to convey moral messages the bestiary , which has been in the possession of @entity9 for almost four centuries , includes animals such as deer and the panther ( centre ) experts are still unsure whether the bestiary was commissioned for a royal client or seized during @entity1 's reign from a dissolved monastic library as well as lions , tigers and apes , the bestiary references a number of mythological animals : @entity35 animal from @entity36 , that has curled horns and emits burning dung			1
the legend may be based on a type of bison in reality			0
@entity44 such as a unicorn @entity47 dog - wolf of @entity48 or @entity49 @entity51 - sized , long - haired , animals with antlers and cloven hooves , that could change their shape at will			2
@entity56 from @entity58 mythology , often goat - like four - legged creature with large horns that it can swivel in any direction			0
satyr creature from @entity64 mythology that were half man , half goat they were popular in the 12th and 13th centuries but few were as lavishly produced as the @entity9 manuscript , which has been in the care of the university for almost four centuries			1
it is unclear whether the bestiary was commissioned for a royal client or seized during @entity77 ’s reign from a dissolved monastic library			0
@entity79 , head of special collections at the university , said : ‘ the @entity4 is a remarkable resource which offers a fascinating insight into the mediaeval mindset			1
‘ we will be turning the pages of the original bestiary each week so we hope people will return time and time again to discover something new			0
’ professor @entity90 , academic advisor to the exhibition , said : ‘ the bestiary is like a medieval encyclopaedia and was written to appeal to the general public and to teach children how to read			0
the bestiary has been described as a ' medieval encyclopaedia ' and a ' remarkable resource ' insight : although @entity86 were widely produced , none were so lavishly illustrated as the @entity9 edition the @entity4 includes sections on birds , including the mythical @entity103 ( pictured ) ‘ it was specifically designed to draw you in and that appeal has stood the test of time			1
it is not about nature but about moral messages and there is a story behind each beautiful illustration			1
' the @entity4 is one of the most lavish ever produced but it was never fully completed and so the edges of the pages were not finished and tidied up			2
‘ this means that the tiny notes from those who created it still remain in the margins , revealing more to us about the method of production than most other surviving medieval books			0
’ the @entity4 is also extremely rare in having a ‘ twin ’ , as it is widely believed to have been created by the same monks , in the same monastic scriptorium , as the @entity129 , held at the @entity130 in @entity131			2
professor @entity132 said : ‘ by comparing the two , we can access an unparalleled amount of information about how the scribes and artists actually worked			0
’ the @entity86 first came to @entity9 in 1625 when it was bequeathed to the @entity9 ’s @entity139 by @entity140 , a former regent of the college and the founder of the first public reference library in @entity144			2
@entity140 , who served as @entity146 secretary to @entity147 , is said to have been given the book by his friend @entity149 , son of the @entity150 to the @entity1			0
the @entity152 exhibition will be open until august 18			0
