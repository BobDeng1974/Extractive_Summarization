by @entity0 published : 19:55 est , 27 january 2013 updated : 14:42 est , 28 january 2013 the morning after the night before : prince @entity1 heads for home yesterday after spending the night in @entity3 after four and a half months in @entity4 he must have a lot of catching up to do			1
no surprise , then , that prince @entity1 spent his first weekend of freedom after returning to the @entity9 enjoying himself overnight with pals			1
the third in line to the throne joined a gang of friends in @entity3 , south - west @entity15 , for a spirited ‘ welcome home ’ bash			1
earlier on saturday night the prince and his friends were apparently seen in the @entity20 pub in @entity21			1
the group were described by onlookers as ‘ lively ’			2
then , around 9pm , @entity1 was spotted at the entrance to @entity26 ’s supermarket in @entity3 @entity27			1
although he had a baseball cap pulled down low over his head , he was instantly recognised by other shoppers who tweeted news of the sighting			1
one , @entity33 , jokingly referred to herself as the ‘ @entity35 ’ , and said : ‘ i was exiting @entity26 ’s in @entity3 @entity27 & casually bumped into @entity1			1
i ’m sure there was a spark			2
eye contact and everything !			0
move over @entity41 ! ! ’ several hours later his @entity43 police protection team were seen at a house in the vicinity			0
@entity1 , still wearing his baseball cap , low - slung jeans and a checked shirt with the sleeves rolled up , did not leave until 10.30 yesterday morning			1
looking slightly weary , but otherwise remarkably unscathed , the prince walked to a waiting car being driven by his detectives and was presumably taken back to his flat at @entity54			1
there was no sign of @entity1 ’s rumoured girlfriend , @entity57 , a blonde student and socialite he dated before he left for the front line			2
there was no sign of @entity1 ’s rumoured girlfriend , @entity57 , pictured left and far right , a blonde student and socialite he dated before he left for the front line the @entity66 pub on @entity21 where prince @entity1 was said to be on saturday night sources insist , however , that the two did keep in touch while he was serving as an @entity71 co-pilot and gunner , and that the prince has been keen to rekindle his relationship with @entity75 , daughter of @entity77			1
although he is one of the world ’s most eligible bachelors , in an interview to mark his return @entity1 bemoaned the fact that girls are put off by his position , rather than attracted by it , saying : ‘ you ai n’t ever going to find someone who ’s going to jump into the position that it would hold			0
’ @entity1 , who arrived back in @entity9 last monday , is now set to enjoy around four weeks leave before returning to duty at @entity91 in @entity92 and undertaking royal duties again			0
the prince is said to have excelled himself on service in @entity4 but caused something of a storm on his return with the interview in which he openly admitted killing members of the @entity101			2
he was also unrepentant about his antics in @entity103 last summer , when he was photographed frolicking naked with a woman in his hotel suite during a game of ‘ strip billiards ’			0
@entity1 admitted that he may have let his family down but insisted that the pictures should not have been made public as it was a ‘ private occasion ’			0
he said : ‘ my father ’s always trying to remind me about who i am and stuff like that			0
‘ but it ’s very easy to forget about who i am when i am in the @entity117			0
everyone ’s wearing the same uniform and doing the same kind of thing			0
‘ i have always said work hard , play hard			0
i will always be enjoying the job ... however long it may carry on for , and then i have the other job to fall back on			0
‘ it was probably a classic case of me being probably being too much @entity117 and not enough prince			2
