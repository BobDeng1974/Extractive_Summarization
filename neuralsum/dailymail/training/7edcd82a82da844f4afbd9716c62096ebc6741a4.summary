the striking similarities that began with the month they were born and have marked their sporting lives now include the island @entity5 and @entity6 call home			1
while @entity9 has moved into contention to win @entity11 , his wife @entity8 has been putting the finishing touches to their move from @entity14 to the @entity15 , about a stone ’s throw from where @entity6 and his new bride live			1
and so the pair will share a private jet to tournaments as well as walk the fairways together			2
they will try to coax one another into making the next five years a period where they leave a mark as indelible as the one sir @entity27 and @entity28 left before them			0
close connections : @entity6 and @entity5 are now neighbours on the same island in the @entity15 rivalry : @entity9 and @entity6 were born a fortnight apart and are now world no 3 and no 1 respectively now entrenched in the world ’s top three , they have become so good there are inevitably going to be a number of tournaments over the next five years where they will face off - and there might even be one on sunday			1
@entity9 shot a useful 70 in the capricious breezes to move to two under , with @entity6 edging a stroke nearer the lead after finishing birdie - birdie for a 73			1
‘ lunch will certainly taste a lot nicer now , ’ said the @entity47			0
to this point , @entity6 has been like the over-achieving big brother , always getting to landmarks about a year ahead of @entity9 , who is a fortnight younger ( @entity6 was 34 on wednesday while @entity9 will reach that age at the end of the month )			1
both have won @entity58 events , @entity65 events , @entity60 events and a major apiece - but it was @entity6 who got there first each time			1
given the eerie parallels , it seems almost inevitable @entity9 will follow in @entity6 ’s footsteps and become world no 1 at some point			1
if he wins the @entity72 , it will happen here			0
in contention : @entity6 and @entity9 are three - under and two - under at @entity11 behind @entity74 's 12 - under ‘ i ’m pleased with that round			1
it was very difficult out there and i could n’t have asked for more , ’ said @entity9			1
the pair must have chuckled to themselves when they saw the draw			2
as if they do n’t spend enough time in each other ’s company			0
it was fascinating watching their strategies over the first 36 holes			0
who ’s going to win the most majors ? i asked that question of @entity93 not long ago and , typically , he gave it some thought			0
‘ about 15 months ago , i ’d have said @entity6 without a moment ’s hesitation , ’ said @entity96 , eventually			1
‘ now ? that ’s a very close call			0
how will @entity6 cope when the ban on long putters begins in 2016 ? i ’d say @entity6 will win four majors and @entity5 three , but i would n’t be surprised if it was the other way round			1
’ benchmark : @entity104 @entity6 is top of the world rankings now , but could be dethroned as soon as sunday good fortune plays its part and both were unlucky to get the wrong end of the draw over the first two days , given they came here in the form of their lives			1
a three - under - par 36 - hole total is about the worst @entity6 could have recorded , given how well he struck the ball			1
predictably , @entity9 suffered a letdown in his first round since claiming his second win in a row at the @entity120 last week			2
the important thing was a 72 did n’t take him out of it			0
so they began friday morning , fully aware this was a day for patience			0
on the first three holes , @entity6 was never out of the middle of the fairway , had a wedge in his hand for two of his three approach shots - and walked to the fourth tee two over par. satisfied : @entity135 's @entity9 said he was ' pleased ' with his second round in tough conditions @entity9 ’s round was a classic case in point			1
he was one over after eight , with nothing happening on the greens			0
then he chipped in for a birdie at the ninth and an eagle three at the 10th			0
how well they putt over the next five years will largely determine their legacy			0
their ball - striking is unquestioned , as is their ambition			2
but neither hole prodigious amounts of putts			0
@entity6 gave himself so many chances but invariably the chance passed with a grimace on his lips rather than a smile			2
@entity9 never holed a putt all day			2
but both are in contention , with @entity164 stride ahead of @entity9 going into the weekend			2
the story of their lives , you might say .			0

@entity6 and @entity9 were *partnered* for their opening two rounds at @entity11
the world no 1 and no 3 are three - under and two - under respectively
@entity9 has recently moved to the same @entity15 island @entity6 lives on
the pair were born a fortnight apart , with @entity9 *slightly* younger
both have won a major apiece , but @entity6 has reached most *milestones* first
