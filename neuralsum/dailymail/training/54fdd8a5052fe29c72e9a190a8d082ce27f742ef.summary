playing @entity0 on clay is the cruellest form of sport , and as if @entity4 did not know that already he got a painful reminder of it again on friday night			1
more than two and a half years since last facing the @entity10 the @entity9 champion produced his best tennis of the year , his best since that heady fortnight of last summer , and still it was not enough			0
@entity4 threw almost everything he had at the world number one but as the bell tolled midnight was edged out of their @entity17 quarter final 1 - 6 , 6 - 3 , 7 - 5 , having created enough chances to score one of the finest wins of his career			1
delight : @entity0 celebrates after beating @entity4 in the quarter - finals of the @entity17 in @entity17 long battle : the @entity10 had to work hard to get past @entity4 who won the first set comfortably respect : the pair shake hands after a titanic battle if this had been on grass , with the margins of self - belief tilted slightly in the opposite directions , then he would surely have closed this one out after working so hard to go 4 - 2 ahead in a thrilling decider			1
but this was the brown dust that @entity0 was borne into , and his marginally sterner resolve and skill in the environment saw him pull through in time - honoured fashion			1
that the @entity10 celebrated afterwards as if he had just retained the @entity45 title was testament to the trial he was put through , and there were ample consolations for the 27 year - old @entity49 in defeat			2
having wobbled over the loss of @entity53 , and at times looked bereft in scrambling around for the form he enjoyed before last september ’s back surgery , this was a statement that his talents have survived it all			0
running out of energy : after being broken back in the third set @entity4 struggled to recover fast start : @entity4 flew out of the blocks against @entity0 and took the first set 6 - 1 to shock the @entity10 number one : but @entity0 really had to dig in against the @entity65 on his return to form it was little surprise that there was some bitter - sweet feeling afterwards , with @entity4 reflecting , “ i thought i did pretty well , and i was expecting to start playing better around this time			1
i do n’t think some people have quite respected what it ’s like to have back surgery and come back from that			0
' but i ’m disappointed with how i played at 4 - 2 , it was a poor game			0
i rushed a bit and against someone like @entity0 you do n’t get many chances			2
' a couple of unforced errors betrayed him at that point , but overall @entity53 ’s legacy was there in his pounding of @entity0 ’s backhand side and sustained aggression			2
at the end @entity0 finished the stronger and broke to love at 5 - 5 , helped by a double fault			1
the opening was not just @entity4 ’s best set of tennis since @entity9 but up with the best of his career as he gave the great @entity10 a rare chasing to take it in just 37 minutes			0
finally : @entity0 celebrates with a fist pump after securing victory struggling : the pair had n't played each other for almost three years , and it was obvious @entity0 was n't comfortable passion : @entity4 roars in celebration after a long point during that first set in @entity17 concentration : the @entity10 regrouped and never looked back a cool evening with slight drizzle probably helped as it took a fraction of the sting from @entity0 ’s heavily spun strokes			1
but it is hard to recall the @entity4 backhand being delivered with more laserlike accuracy , and he used it to open the court up , choosing wisely when to fire it down the line to test his opponent ’s stronger forehand side			2
at 5 - 0 the capacity crowd packed into the steep banks of the @entity127 ’s @entity126 could scarcely believe the domination being exercised over the seven - times champion at this historic venue			0
twice previously this week @entity0 has been forced into a third set , and while that might have sapped even his legs he recovered right on cue			0
@entity4 had a big chance when he created a break point in the second set ’s opening game but that was saved with a massive , outswinging ace to the backhand side			0
the @entity10 also attacked the net to great effect from the second set onwards – he remains the sport ’s great problem solver			0
@entity0 now plays rising star @entity146 while in the other semi-final @entity147 takes on @entity150 @entity149 .			1

@entity0 beats @entity4 1 - 6 , 6 - 3 , 7 - 5 at @entity153 open
@entity49 pushed clay - king all the way in @entity17
