just 48 hours after @entity1 had finished runners - up in a dramatic climax to the 2014 @entity4 , @entity0 retreated to @entity5 to enter his ' cave '			1
needing to balance the demands of performing an all - encompassing job alongside raising a young family , @entity0 agreed with wife @entity10 that he would spend two days alone on the @entity11			1
holiday makers were surprised to spot @entity1 's head coach sitting at poolside as he reflected on an encouraging @entity4 , while daughter @entity14 greeted his decision to dine alone with the message ' weirdo '			1
loner : @entity0 took some time out to collect his thoughts following the @entity4 having organised his thoughts , he returned home to @entity22 to resume a family life currently being interupted for five weeks by the impending summer tour to @entity25 and that will continue to dwindle as the @entity27 looms			1
' sometimes i need space to think things through and that 's always the biggest challenge of the job because there are so many moving parts , ' @entity0 told @entity36			2
' you 've been away in camp and you need some space to think and reflect , plan and review , but you also want to spend time with your family			1
' the kids are 13 and 14 , so quite formative years			0
my teaching background tells me that dad needs to be around as much as possible			0
' there 's a lot of scrutiny around the job , but it 's the time away from home that 's the biggest pressure			1
' it worked better after this @entity4 when i told my wife that i needed a day and a half , which she described as me going into my cave			1
' she said she did n't mind as long as i came out at the end of it ! ' it was a bit of thinking time in the sun , a couple of beers			2
i was on my own , sat at poolside			0
i needed to do some work and the review			2
' loads of people recognised me and kept asking " what are you doing on your own ? ! "			0
' i sent a text to my daughter on the monday evening and said " i 'm just having a meal in this restaurant "			0
' she asked who was i with and when i replied no - one , she text me back saying ' weirdo ' and turned the phone off ! that 's the price of fame ! it was quite funny really			2
' it was what i needed - i did my work , got back and was out of my cave			2
' turnaround : @entity0 has turned @entity1 into challengers for the @entity27 after 2011 's disaster the two years of @entity87 's stewardship have seen @entity1 emerge from the wreckage of their dismal @entity89 to become a force capable of challenging for the @entity92 trophy next year			1
alongside the overhaul of a team that had lost its way during successive failed regimes , @entity87 has established a squad culture that makes a repeat of the reputation - damaging visits to @entity25 in 2008 and 2011 unthinkable			2
@entity1 's progress has brought with it greater recognition for the 44 - year - old @entity103 , an element of the job with which he is becoming increasingly comfortable			1
' i do n't get recognised wherever i go because i did n't have that high a profile when i was a player , ' he said			2
' i 'm not in the public eye all the time , but it is growing with every campaign			0
' the attention takes a bit of getting used to when you 've never had it before , but it 's always good			0
' i enjoy talking to people about rugby , i love that part of the job			0
' @entity87 's passion for the sport extends to coaching son @entity122 at @entity22 under - 13s , with his presence on the sidelines often noticed by trophy - hunting opposition coaches			1
' when i started coaching them i was @entity129 coach and none of them knew what the @entity129 were , ' he said			1
' they were only six at the time , so they 've never known any different than me coaching them			1
' it 's more the opposition who notice it			0
the local teams are used to it , it 's more when you go away they think , " @entity144 "			0
' then if we lose , their coach wants photos with his thumbs up claiming victory ! ' the second year of @entity87 's reign has been pockmarked by occasional criticism			0
although at ease with his own media duties , @entity0 believes his future will remain on the training ground			0
' i do n't know what will happen next , so you never look too far ahead			0
but i 'm most motivated by helping coaches improve as coaches , ' he said			0
' i enjoy working with people to help them get better and that does n't matter if it 's my son 's under - 13 team , or spending time with the @entity1 under - 20s or sevens			1
i like adding value and building teams			0
' comfort zone : @entity87 is most at ease on the training pitch coaching players and building teams			1

@entity1 coach spent time alone to review @entity4
enjoys his low - profile despite such a big role
tries to balance the demands of the @entity1 job with a *normal* family life
feels most at home on the training pitch coaching players
