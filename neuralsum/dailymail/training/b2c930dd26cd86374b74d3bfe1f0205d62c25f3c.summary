by @entity0 published : 14:57 est , 7 august 2013 updated : 15:53 est , 7 august 2013 on saturday morning , the ancient cuckoo clock on our kitchen wall marked a momentous change in our family life			1
as the moth - eaten bird hurtled out of its hole at 9am , i realised something was missing among the pile of @entity11 , spilt milk and general breakfast chaos : my eldest child			1
the baby that did n't sleep for the first five years of her life ( and rose any time around 5am thereafter ) was still in her bed , dead to the world under a pile of old soft toys and discarded clothes			1
and when she finally tumbled downstairs onto the sofa with a sigh , a new era dawned			0
mother does n't know best : @entity0 's pre-teen daughter has become grumpier and does n't do as she 's told ( posed by models ) she 'd gone to bed as a little girl and woken up as a teenager			1
you may not believe it , but it was like witnessing the opposite formula of @entity33			0
anyway , overnight everything changed , because my daughter had broken my heart			0
to use the teenage vernacular , i 'd been dumped ( or whatever the maternal equivalent of being dumped is )			0
she 'd grown up and i was no longer needed			1
growing up fast : @entity0 wonders where her little girl has gone ( posed by model ) this reduced me to a simpering mess , trailing around behind her , desperate for some morsel of attention , a sign that she still wanted me in her life			1
i was like a lovesick ex. right now i 'd give anything just to clasp her hand in mine again , to cuddle her in her nightie or , @entity59 forbid , to kiss the pale freckles on her nose ( the ones that she hates , but i love )			0
we all know motherhood is a painful series of ' letting go ' moments as your offspring speed towards adulthood - but this stage is a particularly cruel and brutal parting			1
where the hell is my little ruby - haired toddler ? who has nabbed the roly - poly newborn i used to sing @entity79 to in the early hours of the new day ? will i ever see the proud , smiley face that i photographed in her uniform on her very first day at school again ? i have suddenly acquired a quieter , more self - conscious version of my first born			1
enter the ever - so - slightly grumpy queen of the one - word answer			2
i do n't recognise her			0
later , i try to talk to this sulky new model of my beloved toddler to find out how i might be able to win her heart again			0
i practise a sensible , rational conversation in my head , but as i get close to her while she watches tv , i just blurt out , ' cuddle me ! ' it 's not that she ’s difficult or argumentative ( though i fear this is what i would see if i peeked over the precipice into the dark valley of teenagerdom )			2
she has simply become more grown up			2
this is , of course , my problem , not hers			0
she wants more time alone			0
sleep tight the @entity107 recommends the average four - year - old should get 11.5 hours of sleep per night if i walk into a room when she 's with her friends , they instantly stop talking			1
if i ask her to brush her hair , she flounces off in the manner of @entity116 and does n't brush her hair for days			0
i 've lost count of the illogical things she 's done since saturday in order to prove the point that i am wrong about everything			2
' that 's so her , ' i hear her saying to her sister one night after one of my maternal crimes ( the bed - before - midnight rule , probably )			1
so , fellow mothers , have i lost her forever just two weeks before her 11th birthday ? tell me , what are the rules for pre-teen girls ? the arrival of this new personality has pushed me into the arms of another - my two - year - old daughter @entity138			1
she can not get or give enough love			0
she is up for a cuddle every second of every minute , showering me in her addictive , slobbery kisses			0
her love is like a drug , which on the one hand satisfies my needy maternal urges , but on the other reminds me of what i have lost with my eldest , the one where the parental journey began			0
there ’s no cure for the ' mummy blues ' is there ? there is no mood booster for the grief of letting the world 's most wonderful memories slip through your fingers , lost in the sands of time ? there are no more babies , so what 's the solution to this temporary sadness ? doughnuts ? just as i 'm figuring it all out , the smallest of my four provides me with some help			2
she subtly shows me there 's a lot not to mourn as my offsprings ' childhoods rush by as she launches yet another of her dirty protests in the potty - training battle			1
so maybe a new carpet is the answer to my woes			0
what with the combined forces of four children over the years , the one outside the loo is n't up to any more near misses			2
