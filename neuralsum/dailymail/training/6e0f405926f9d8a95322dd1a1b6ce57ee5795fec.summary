" ' ' i do n't know why he was there , but he definitely did n't want to order pizza			2

my colleague was out on a delivery , so i was on my own			0
' i saw this guy in a baseball cap walk up to the door on his phone			1
i assumed he was going to come in and order , so i walked behind the counter			2
' but he just leant against the little wall by the patio and stared at me			2
he kept looking at me for a few seconds			2
i was pretty weirded out by it , so i asked him if he wanted any help			2
' that 's when he gave me this really creepy smile			1
it scared me , so i walked in the back and by the time i came back out he had gone			0
' @entity33 's reaction to the individual can be seen on camera footage , shot on a second device inside the shop			1
she went on : ' i got on with my shift and later that night i was out with my friend when we heard a car crash down the street			0
we ran over to see what it was and saw the cops all round this guy			0
' @entity13 is seen on the footage watching who she now believes was @entity2 @entity33 stops and looks at the man , clearly finding his behavior odd although @entity33 did n't realize it at the time , she had just witnessed the aftermath of @entity2 's rampage , which culminated in a gun battle with police			1
after letting off rounds at officers , he crashed his black @entity181 and by the time he had been pulled out of the wreckage he was dead , having suffered a single gunshot wound to the head			0
it is believed he shot himself with one of the 400 bullets he had left in his car			0
@entity33 went on : ' i was at home later that night and my friend sent me a link to the guy 's @entity44 video			0
the moment i watched it i recognized him			0
' then i found out he lived just a block away from me			0
i used to walk past his apartment every day			2
it 's so horrible to think he killed those people in there			2
' if i 'm honest i 'm trying not to think about it			0
after all , nothing happened and i 'm ok , but sometimes i do think how lucky i am that he did n't come in and do something			0
' the owner of the popular restaurant @entity207 has watched the video dozens of times and still ca n't be sure if @entity2 is the man who walks up to the door			1
he said : ' it is impossible to tell			0
' the next day there was a big soccer game on and we were absolutely packed at that time			0
he may have got the days confused and thought that was on friday and that the restaurant was going to be busy			2
that is just speculation as no one really knows			0
