beating @entity0 to the signing of @entity2 last summer would have allowed @entity3 to battle for the @entity5 title this season			1
that 's the view of former @entity9 striker @entity8 , who is convinced @entity11 ' side would be near the top of the table with @entity14 and @entity15 had they signed the @entity17			0
the @entity19 club were keen on a move for the former @entity22 star but he eventually joined the @entity23 from @entity24 in a £ 30million deal			2

' @entity2 went to @entity0 , and the rest is history - he 's scoring goals , playing at a high tempo and has taken to the @entity5 like a duck to water			2
' @entity3 missed out on the closest thing they could have got to @entity29			0
i honestly believe had they signed @entity2 , they 'd be challenging for the title , and the good times would still be rolling at @entity19			0
