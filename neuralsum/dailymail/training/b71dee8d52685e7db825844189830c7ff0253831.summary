by @entity0 published : 07:53 est , 4 march 2013 updated : 19:06 est , 4 march 2013 injured : sir @entity1 shows his bandaged hand as he speaks to the media during a press conference at @entity5 he famously chopped off the tips of his fingers with a fretsaw after suffering frostbite during a solo walk to the @entity11			1
and today , sir @entity1 revealed that he may lose two more fingers after being forced to pull out of the first ever trek of the @entity14 during winter			1
the 68 - year - old was injured in a fall while skiing during training at a base camp in @entity14 ahead of the @entity20 expedition which has been five years in the planning			1
he then developed frostbite after taking off his outer gloves to fix a ski binding in temperatures of around minus @entity26 ( minus @entity27 ) - possibly costing him two more of his fingers			1
speaking at a press conference at @entity5 today , he said : ' on this occasion with me i was trying to fix the ski binding in a total white - out			1
' i tried fixing the bindings with my big overgloves on - could n't do a damn thing			2
you could n't peel a banana with them on			0
' some people would say surely you should n't take your mitts off			0
ok , so you sit there and go nowhere and die of cold			0
' you 've got to fix your bindings in order to go back			2
it 's one of those things			0
' i had to take everything off to get a grip on the bindings			0
' it was no more than 20 minutes before i noticed one of my hands had gone completely white			0
' the vascular surgeon i saw yesterday said that , in his opinion - he was n't sure - two of the fingers definitely would not require surgery and two of the fingers might require surgery , to be shorter			1
' the explorer said the surgeon who treated his fingers in @entity64 suggested that diabetes may be responsible for causing the frostbite			1
sir @entity1 , who was described as ' the world 's greatest living explorer ' by @entity70 in 1984 , continued : ' two and a half months ago , my normal gp took a blood sample and said i might be on the verge of type two diabetes			1
asked how he was coping with the pain , sir @entity1 replied : ' i 'm on pills , lots of pills at the moment and they 're working very well at the moment			1
' @entity1 lost the tips of his fingers on his left hand after he attempted to walk solo and unsupported to the @entity11 in 2000			1
his sleds fell through weak ice and @entity1 was forced to pull them out by hand			1
he sustained severe frostbite to the tips of all the fingers on his left hand , forcing him to abandon the attempt			1
on returning home , his surgeon insisted the necrotic fingertips be retained for several months before amputation , to allow regrowth of the remaining healthy tissue			0
frustrated : @entity117 ' injuries forced him to pull out of the first winter crossing of the world 's coldest continent but , impatient at the pain the dying fingertips caused , @entity1 cut them off himself with a fretsaw , just above where the blood and the soreness were			1
sir @entity1 today admitted he was ' frustrated ' he had to quit this latest expedition but said he will continue to support the project through fundraising			1
describing how he felt at having to pull out , he said : ' it is extremely frustrating			0
i started working on this expedition five years ago			2
' i 've been working on it and nothing else full time and unpaid for five years so it is definitely frustrating but unavoidable and i will make the best of it by putting my focus full time on to making my focus entirely on the expedition team			2
' his team - mates will continue with the 2,000 - mile ( 3,219km ) trek , which they are expected to embark on later this month			1
hailed as the last great polar challenge , the journey across the @entity14 has never been attempted during the winter			1
the team will experience some of the toughest conditions on earth - near permanent darkness and temperatures as low as minus @entity153 ( minus @entity154 ) during their six - month journey			1
sir @entity1 went on : ' you could not put a better team together than that lot			1
' i 'm very pleased with and proud of the team in charge of the crossing			0
' everything is going totally on schedule as of today			0
' the coldest journey team was dropped off by ship on the @entity166 of the continent where they set off over the ice shelf			0
the aim was to ascend 10,000ft ( 3,000m ) on to the inland plateau , and head onwards to the @entity172			0
record - breaking : @entity1 has broken several records and led many expeditions to remote regions			1
he was described by @entity70 in 1984 as ' the world 's greatest living explorer ' happier times : in a photo posted on their @entity182 account the research team are shown enjoying a meal with the expedition team after covering around 2,000 miles ( 3,200km ) their journey was due to end at the @entity187			2
@entity188 , a trustee with the @entity189 which is behind the expedition , spoke enthusiastically about the trek			2
' i ca n't emphasise enough that in our strange , dull , bleak , boring , flattened - out , money - grabbing world , this is the most extraordinary adventure , ' she said			2

will his arm drop off ? can the boys do it ? ' it is utterly thrilling			0
' @entity1 hoped to raise £ 6.17 million for @entity232 , a charitable initiative to tackle avoidable blindness around the world			2
speaking at the press conference today , he said : ' i will focus now 100 per cent on making sure that the expedition has every possible encouragement , has every chance of making maximum money for our charity			2
' the expedition will take six months , during which three million people will go avoidably blind			0
' making it alive across one of the most inhospitable terrains in the world was always going to be a huge challenge			0
one hundred years ago on the same ice shelf , capt @entity251 died on his polar expedition as he was caught out by the start of the southern winter			2
if anyone was up to the job , it was @entity1			2
he has spent 40 years achieving extraordinary feats which pushed him to the very ends of his endurance			0
he is famous for taking part in the first successful circumnavigation via both the geographical poles , completed with @entity265 in 1982			0
@entity1 also achieved a world first in 1992 - 1993 by completing the first unsupported crossing of the @entity14 with @entity268 in what was the longest unsupported polar journey in history			1
sir @entity1 had a double heart bypass in 2003 and suffered a heart attack two years later as he came agonisingly close to the summit of @entity218			1
he finally reached the top in 2009 on his third attempt , becoming the oldest @entity277 to do so at 65 years of age			0
optimistic : sir @entity1 , second left , pictured with the expedition team - from left , @entity280 , @entity281 and @entity282 - before they left for the @entity14 sir @entity1 , pictured during his marathon challenge , cut part of the fingers off his left hand rather than wait for an operation @entity1 ' latest injury is the second time he has suffered severe frost bite			1
in 2000 , the explorer cut part of his own fingers off with a fretsaw after his left hand was badly damaged by the condition - caused by exposure to freezing temperatures			1
he was attempting to walk solo and unsupported to the @entity11 when his sledge carrying all his food and communication equipment slipped into the sea			0
after freeing the sledge his wet hands were exposed to temperatures as low as @entity304 causing the tissue on the tops of his fingers to die			2
in his autobiography , @entity1 wrote : ' my fingers were ramrod stiff and ivory white			1
' they might as well have been wood ... i had seen enough frost bite in others to realise i was in serious trouble			0
i had to turn back			0
' he was told he needed to wait up to five months to give the healthy tissue a chance to grow , but instead @entity1 bought the saw and spent five days removing the tips of his damaged fingers and thumb			1
it was not the first or last time the adventurer has had to abandon challenges because of injury or illness			0
@entity1 also had to be rescued during an attempt in 1996 to walk to the @entity172 solo when he suffered a kidney stone attack			2
the explorer also had to abandon an ascent of @entity218 in 2005 when he was 1,0000ft from the summit after he suffered chest pain			0
he told @entity336 afterwards that ' it felt like an elephant was sitting on my chest			0
' four years later he became the first person ever to reach the summit of @entity218 and cross both polar ice caps			0
the explorer suffered a heart attack in 2003 and underwent a double heart bypass operation			0
however , he managed to complete seven marathons in seven days on seven continents just four months later .			0

the 68 - year - old developed frostbite after taking off his outer gloves to fix a ski binding in temperatures of around minus @entity354 ( minus @entity27 )
he now faces losing two more parts of his fingers in *future* surgery
sir @entity1 said diabetes may have made him more susceptible to frostbite
first expedition across the @entity14 in winter will still go ahead this month
