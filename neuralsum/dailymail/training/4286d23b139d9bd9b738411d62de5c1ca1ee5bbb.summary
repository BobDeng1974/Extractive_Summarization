by @entity0 for the @entity1 and @entity2 for @entity3 if you were planning an outdoor activity today , you might be better off with a board game			2
after one of the coldest nights for an @entity9 weekend on record , today will see most of us sheltering from heavy rain , with some areas colder than @entity14			1
sub-zero temperatures were recorded in @entity16 early yesterday , while rural @entity17 saw them plummet to within a couple of degrees of freezing			2
today ’s heavy rain sweeping across the @entity23 is likely to cause travel chaos – as @entity9 travellers return home – and disruption to events such as the @entity29 , forecasters warned			1
gloom : just one beachgoer can bear to remove his shirt as clouds roll over @entity34 , @entity35 , bringing the first showers of a country - wide downpour tomorrow you might have some use of that towel after all ... the first pitter - patters of rain were hitting @entity44 , @entity45 , already this afternoon wet : a woman uses her jacket to shield herself from the rain at the @entity49 in @entity45			1
the rain will spread across the @entity51 and turn heavy over the next 24 hours some areas will be deluged by as much as 1.5in as temperatures struggle to get much higher than an autumnal 12 - @entity54 ( @entity55 ) , buffeted by winds of up to 40mph			2
the @entity58 ’s @entity57 said : ‘ the @entity23 will see a good 18 hours ’ on - and - off rain , with rain actually falling for 12 to 15 hours of that time , unfortunately			2
’ yellow weather warnings of heavy rain were issued for @entity63 and much of @entity64			1
@entity65 of forecasting service @entity67 added : ‘ monday could be very miserable indeed … it looks the worst of the three weekend days			0
’ saturday night saw @entity16 record @entity69 ( @entity71 ) – its lowest ever august temperature – at @entity73 , @entity74 , while @entity75 , @entity17 , and @entity76 , @entity77 , shivered at @entity78 ( @entity79 ) beneath clear skies			0
determined : but at least one surfer at @entity49 had found another use for her board as the rain started lashing @entity51 's western extremities this afternoon true gentleman : a visitor to @entity49 beach chivalrously holds his umbrella over his partner as she and a friend drag a baby 's buggy through the sodden sands anyone for ice cream ? anyone ? ... a lonely ice - cream seller looks around for customers at @entity44 , but it seems most would rather something hot it was only a few degrees off @entity64 ’s august record of @entity102 ( @entity103 )			1
today ’s temperatures will be a little better , but could be the coolest august bank holiday monday in decades – and colder than @entity107 , on the borders of the @entity14 region , predicted to be @entity110 ( @entity111 )			2
@entity51 ’s coldest august bank holiday monday daytime temperature on record , excluding mountaintops , stands at @entity116 ( @entity117 ) at @entity118 in @entity119 in 2011			0
rain is set to sweep south into the @entity121 tomorrow before another band arrives on thursday			2
getting the last of that tan in : a young woman is warm enough on @entity127 beach to strip down to her knickers allow the last of the summer sun 's rays to kiss her skin better choice than @entity45 : at least these visitors to the @entity127 sea front were still able to enjoy the weather in short sleeves warm in the sun : the red , shimmering face of this sun worshipper suggests the sea wind was only slightly blunting his enjoyment of the sun 's rays romantic in @entity145 : two music fans share a kiss and raise their hands in the air as they sit atop the crowds at the @entity145 lost in the music : this woman sits atop a friend 's shoulders and closes her eyes and raises her hands as she takes in the bands at the @entity145 enjoy it while you can : temperatures were up to @entity161 in @entity145 , but it will be wellies at the ready for festival goers when the rain rolls in making the most of it : young women wander the fields of @entity145 in their party gear @entity172 spot : this @entity145 goer is bathed in afternoon sun as she takes a break from the bands to sit on the grass and enjoy some food a chilly start augured disappointment for @entity9 revellers at @entity145 and @entity183 festivals who face peak temperatures below the seasonal average			1
pictures yesterday showed the @entity188 and @entity189 swathed in mist , while there were anecdotal reports of early morning fog as far south as the @entity195 commuter belt			0
bookies are shortening odds that this @entity9 is going to be the coldest ever			0
@entity198 is offering odds of just 4/6 that temperatures plummet below -2c somewhere in @entity64 , @entity63 and @entity16 before midnight on bank holiday monday , breaking the record set in @entity204 in 1994			1
sky high : these festival goers take in one of the rides in @entity183 ; their gumboots are a fitting accessory given how grey the sky is behind them to infinity and beyond : this music fan took a different approach to weather appropriate clothing at the @entity145 , opting for a @entity217 costume rather than gumboots and a rain jacket ready for the rain : a woman helps a male companion put on a poncho at the @entity183 festival , as two less weather conscious men stroll past enjoying a drink well prepared : these @entity183 festival goers took different approaches to wet weather footwear , with one opting for gumboots while the other simply bagged up their shoes hands up if you 're having fun : music fans swarm towards the @entity239 's front man during their set at @entity145 , as he leans backwards to avoid getting grabbed despite weather warnings , the chances of record rainfall look much slimmer however at 20/1 with the 135mm that fell in @entity245 , @entity63 in 1986 not likely to be surpassed			1
those who think the weather forecasters have been unduly pessimistic can take evens that a peak temperature of over @entity250 is registered somewhere before the holiday is out			0
@entity252 of @entity198 said : ' this year 's august bank holiday looks set to break records for all the wrong reasons			0
sadly , it 's now long odds - on that the best of the weather has passed for the year			0

' we do have some outbreaks of rain currently pushing into the @entity284 of the country , ' he said			0
' while these are sporadic at the moment we are expecting wet and windy conditions overnight and into tomorrow			0
' ' we do have a @entity291 ' be aware ' warning in place for most of @entity64 and @entity63 , ' he said , which is due to an area of low pressure pushing in from the west			1
he said the warning should especially be heeded by anyone hoping to make day trips on the @entity9 , since ' this is going to lead to some unpleasant travelling conditions			0
' he added : ' it 's going to be for much of @entity64 and @entity63 quite an unpleasant @entity9			1

it 's not going to be warm , but it 's going to be a lot clearer			0
' in the medium term , according to mr @entity277 , the heavy train would ' sink away ' but there would still be lingering showers on tuesday			2
on wednesday many parts would start dry , but cloudy			0
' but we are expecting the rain to come back on thursday and it 's going to stay a little unsettled towards the end of the month			2
' @entity315 forecaster @entity314 said : ' a change is looming for the new week , as @entity318 low pressure systems queue up to bring rather wet and windy weather at times , particularly across @entity64 , @entity63 and @entity321 [ on monday ] and tuesday and across most of the @entity51 later in the week			1
' a cloudy start to what will be a generally cloudy bank holiday monday across @entity64 and @entity63 , with occasional outbreaks of rain spreading northeast reaching most parts during the morning			1
' the rain turning heavy and persistent at times across @entity63 and southern @entity64 - where we could see as much as 30 - 40mm [ 1.5ins ] fall by the end of the day			1
' a gusty southwesterly wind accompanying the rain too			0

today an area of low pressure will sweep across @entity64 and @entity63 bringing heavy rain
first showers of the coming inundations already begin to hit @entity64 's western extremities
it appears to be an early end to what had seemed a *vintage* summer only a *fortnight* *ago*
