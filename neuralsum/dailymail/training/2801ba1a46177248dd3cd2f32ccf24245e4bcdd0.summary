by @entity0 published : 19:09 est , 30 july 2013 updated : 03:41 est , 31 july 2013 @entity1 is to appeal $ 1billion of compensation payments for its @entity5 oil spill , after lashing out at ‘ absurd ’ claims by @entity8 law firms cashing in on the disaster			1
the @entity11 oil giant yesterday increased its estimate of the total bill for the 2010 disaster to an eye - watering £ 27.7billion			0
some £ 6.3billion of the total is made up of claims by people who say the accident cost them money , many of them fishermen , hoteliers and restaurant owners			2
but @entity1 is set to battle ‘ fictitious ’ claims by ‘ greedy ’ lawyers looking to use the oil company as a cash machine			1
the explosion happened on 20 april 2010 triggering the worst oil spill in @entity8 history			1
@entity1 says it will fight fanciful legal claims over the accident ‘ no company would agree to a settlement that pays businesses that suffered no losses , ’ said chief executive @entity33			1
‘ we want everyone to know that we are digging in and are well - prepared for the long haul on legal matters			0
’ mr @entity33 took the reins at @entity1 in 2010 after an explosion ripped through its @entity45 rig in the @entity5 , killing 11 people and triggering the worst oil spill in @entity8 history			1
he replaced gaffe - prone predecessor @entity47 , who infamously enraged @entity8 as the disaster unfolded by declaring : ‘ i ’d like my life back			2
’ and mr @entity33 has proved a far more popular figure in the @entity8 , particularly given his roots in the @entity54 state of @entity55			2
@entity57 fish lie dead stuck in oil in @entity59 near @entity60 , @entity61			0
many of the claims are from businesses directl affected by the accident but the @entity8 sought to show he was no pushover , warning that @entity1 would take its appeal against ‘ absurd ’ claims all the way to the @entity70 if necessary			1
he pointed out his duty to protect the interests of investors in @entity1 , a major component of the pension funds that will help millions of @entity11 through their retirement			2
‘ @entity1 shareholders , of which there are many in the @entity11 - and the dividends from this company are so important here - should be unhappy , just as they should be in the @entity8 , ’ he said			1
mr @entity33 added that the @entity5 compensation process was ‘ curious and somewhat out of control ’			2
he lashed out at @entity8 ’s litigation culture , saying that inflated claims against @entity1 were a symptom of a wider problem			1
he cited a claim by residents of @entity92 against weathermen who failed to predict the devastating tornado that ripped through the @entity8 state earlier this year , killing 23 people and injuring 377 more			2
and he said he was recently invited to join a £ 15million lawsuit against @entity99 over its failure to provide free drinks coupons that it had advertised			0
‘ there ’s something wrong with this system , ’ he said			0
‘ the precedent is not good for @entity8			0
’ mr @entity33 ’s comments have been spurred by a sudden surge in claims by law firms winning compensation not just for their clients , but for themselves			0
the compensation fund is administered by a judge , meaning @entity1 has no control over who is deemed eligible for a payment			1
since @entity1 agreed to settle , administrators of the settlement fund have paid an average £ 527,000 to more than 300 law firms , adding up to more than £ 160million in total			0
but in the past week the average claim by a law firm has spiralled to nearly £ 1million , while one firm secured a £ 10million payment for itself			0
the cash windfalls come on top of any fees charged to ordinary claimants such as shrimp farmers and hoteliers , who typically forfeit up to 25 per cent of their payouts to lawyers acting on their behalf			0
a dam erected at @entity136 , @entity61 , to protect the island 's beaches from oil that washes ashore from the deepwater horizon oil rig explosion and spill in the @entity5 the rough ride given to @entity1 contrasts with the treatment of @entity8 construction giant @entity144 , which made the cement on the @entity11 firm ’s doomed well			1
@entity144 has agreed to pay a fine of just $ 200,000 after it was found to have destroyed evidence from tests it performed on the quality of the cement used in the well			0
but the financial hit is dwarfed by @entity1 ’s own costs , which it has warned could rise beyond the £ 27.7billion it has set aside			1
@entity1 has previously warned it faces a ‘ feeding frenzy ’ of lawyers , while the firm ’s @entity8 head of communications last week said the firm ’s efforts to meet its obligations were being exploited			1
‘ the @entity45 settlement could have been a model for resolving lawsuits after industrial accidents , ’ said @entity165			0
‘ instead it ’s running into a monument to plaintiffs ’ lawyers ’ greed			0
’ @entity1 intends to appeal against some £ 650million of payouts in total , with claims by law firms believed to make up nearly half of the total .			2
