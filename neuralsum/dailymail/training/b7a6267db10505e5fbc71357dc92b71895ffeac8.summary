it was @entity1 who first sounded the warning : ‘ we are playing against the best side in @entity5 and if we have two or three passengers it can become embarrassing against sides like this who are deadly ’			1
the @entity12 skipper , it seems , is wise before the event			0
for if the @entity17 ’s bottom club , @entity16 , can expose their shortcomings , then the @entity15 champions could well humiliate			0
just ask @entity19 and his @entity21 colleagues how brutal @entity22 were in their 7 - 1 demolition on tuesday night , for the continent ’s very best sides can be unforgiving if catching even illustrious opponents on an off - day			0
@entity28 gets reacquainted with the @entity30 weather as @entity32 train at @entity33 on tuesday @entity28 has been in scintillating form so far this season , scoring 19 goals so far @entity12 captain @entity1 has warned @entity32 could punish them if they do n't perform at @entity33 , on wednesday , a lacklustre @entity12 would be torn to pieces – they might even play well and be soundly beaten			1
for @entity32 – and @entity28 – are not favourites to become the first team in history to defend a @entity43 crown without very good reason			1
already this season @entity28 himself has provided us with 19 reminders as to his unrelenting hunger for goals and glory			1
indeed , he has scored in every game he has played since @entity52 kicked off in late august and is in the midst of a run of 16 goals in seven			0
with 15 in the league , he has two more than @entity12 have managed in total			1
@entity12 saw some weaknesses exposed in sunday 's match at @entity16 but they did emerge 3 - 2 winners goalkeeper @entity61 reaches out in vain to try and prevent a @entity64 header creeping in as @entity22 proved in their 7 - 1 thrashing of @entity21 , even @entity15 heavyweights can destroy each other @entity69 ’s side have won their last seven on the spin – @entity72 and @entity73 demolished 5 - 0 in their last two – and any talk of an early - season stutter is now somewhat muted			1
meanwhile , in the @entity17 , @entity12 continue to stumble in a @entity78 existence			0
they have dropped 11 points already this season and recent victories over @entity16 and @entity82 were not without their scares			0
some supporters of a positive mindset may well point to @entity28 ’s record against them as reason for optimism , for in five appearances for @entity90 at @entity33 he never once found the back of the net , scoring just twice in four fixtures at @entity94			0
@entity69 's @entity32 have won their last seven on the spin and their last two by a 5 - 0 scoreline @entity28 has never scored at @entity33 - he is pictured here celebrating @entity99 's winner in 2007 @entity28 is within striking distance of @entity102 's @entity43 goalscoring record 1			1
@entity102 ( @entity32 , @entity103 ) 71 goals 2			0
@entity28 ( @entity90 , @entity32 ) 69 3			1
@entity105 ( @entity106 ) 69 4			0
@entity108 ( @entity107 , @entity90 , @entity32 ) 56 5			2
@entity109 ( @entity110 , @entity111 , @entity106 ) 50 but the @entity113 superstar only looks forward , not back , and his sights are now trained on yet another record – that of the @entity43 greatest - ever goalscorer			2
the 29 - year - old – with 69 strikes in @entity5 ’s premier competition – needs just three more to surpass @entity32 legend @entity102			2
he will , of course , better that total , but with @entity106 ’s @entity105 now tied with his real counterpart following tuesday ’s goal against @entity123 , @entity28 will not want to afford his adversary the honour of taking the title before he does			2
to that end , a hat - trick in front of @entity129 would just about do it			0
@entity1 was n’t naming names when he guarded against @entity32 ’s ruthlessness , but we know who he meant			1
@entity12 : you have been warned .			2

@entity12 take on @entity32 in @entity43 on wednesday
