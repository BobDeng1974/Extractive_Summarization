a new test that can identify whether long - dead ancient humans had suffered from malaria could help scientists trace how the disease has evolved			1
archaeologists at @entity6 in @entity7 , @entity8 , have developed a way of diagnosing the disease in skeletons thousands of years old			1
scientists have used the technique to reveal that infants and toddlers found in a cemetery within an ancient @entity18 villa in @entity19 had died of the disease			1
@entity40 , an archaeologist at @entity6 who led the research team , said : ' the data set we build with this will be revolutionary for establishing the epidemiological curve for malaria in ancient societies			1
attempts to develop a vaccine against malaria have been frustrated by the parasite 's highly variable nature			1
the parasite also tends to hide within red blood cells , making it difficult for the immune system to spot			2
scientists at the @entity58 claim to have created a potential vaccine that can protect against lethal strains of malaria			1
the vaccine , developed blood samples taken from @entity64 children naturally resistant to the disease , works by imprisoning the @entity68 - causing parasites inside the red blood cells they infect			1
the scientists pinpointed a protein called @entity73 which the parasites need to escape from the red blood cells they infect			2
scientists found that an antibody produced by the immune children hits the malaria parasite at a critical stage in its life - cycle by taking action against this protein			1
the researchers said that an experimental vaccine based on this idea protected mice in five trials and will be tested on lab monkeys beginning in the next four to six weeks			0
' by understanding how this parasite reacted to societal shifts in the past , we can aid in predicting its future behavior			0
we can understand the way it has evolved			0
' miss @entity98 and her colleagues developed the test by identifying specific chemical signals and molecules that are found in the bones of people infected with malaria			1
they found that a large molecule called hemozoin , which is expelled as a waste product by the malaria plasmodium parasite			1
using x-ray defraction , miss @entity98 and her team found they were able to identify black crystalline lumps of the molecule in the bone marrow of bone samples			1
they tested the technique on the remains of 100 children buried in a cemetery within the ruins of @entity124 at @entity125 in @entity126 , @entity19			0
the bodies , which dated from @entity128 , had been buried with heavy roof tiles to weigh them down			0
miss @entity40 said : ' researchers from the @entity132 had found burial practices that were throwbacks to pagan rituals			0
' it was suspected there must have been an epidemic in the community that caused fever or fits			0
' with the help of dr @entity142 , an archaeologist at the @entity132 , miss @entity98 was able to identify hemozoin in femur and humerus bone samples from the site - confirming they had been infected with malaria			1
malaria is spread by blood sucking female mosquitoes like the anopheles stephensi mosquito shown above this electron micrograph shows a malarial sporozoite migrating through the cytoplasm of a mosquito cell they were able to confirm that the test was accurate using a technique that searches for dna of the pathogen			2
however , dna extraction is not always possible and sometimes unreliable			0
malaria is one of the world 's biggest infectious killers , infecting around 200 million people every year and claiming the lives of more than 500,000			0
not all @entity169 parasites cause malaria in humans			0
one , known as @entity172 , is responsible for most of the deaths while others like @entity175 cause a milder form of the disease			0
plasmodium knowlesi rarely cause malaria in humans while other strains of the parasite only infect primates , other mammals or birds			2
the malaria parasite has a life cycle ( above ) that requires female mosquitoes to pass it between human hosts plasmodium falciparum is known to have been in existence for up to 100,000 years , but the population size did not increase until around 10,000 years ago			1
it is thought that the disease may have originally evolved in gorillas and then passed to humans , but the evidence for this is inconclusive			0
professor @entity200 , an anthropologist at @entity6 who also took part in the work , said the test could now help reveal when and where the disease first began infecting humans			2
he said : ' there is a constant evolution of this disease , because of changes in human populations and changes in the medicines we use to treat it			0
' knowing the history of the mechanisms by which malaria evolves is a very good thing			2
we want to put together enough data for a timeline of malaria in humans			0

scientists at @entity6 developed a new way of diagnosing malaria
they look for a waste product produced by the parasite in bone marrow
crystals of this protein form inside ancient bones of infected individuals
this allowed researchers to diagnose children that died *1,500* years ago
they say it could be used to trace the spread of malaria in human history
