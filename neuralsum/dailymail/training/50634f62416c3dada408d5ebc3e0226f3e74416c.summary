by @entity0 published : 19:38 est , 10 december 2013 updated : 03:46 est , 11 december 2013 he has long been celebrated for highlighting the beauty of the industrial @entity3			0
but @entity5 artist @entity4 may not have been quite as fond of his roots as previously thought , according to newly - discovered letters			1
the artist , famous for his ' matchstick men ' paintings , privately described his hometown of @entity13 as ' a place of the dead ' , it has emerged			1
many of @entity4 's drawings and paintings depict @entity18			1
he painted scenes of life in the industrial districts of @entity22 the comment was made in a confidential letter to a friend after @entity4 had visited the city , the subject of many of his most famous works			2
the less than flattering assessment is ironic given the backlash @entity4 received from the art world for being ' too northern '			1
he is said to have resented the @entity34 - centric galleries of his day who adopted a snobbish attitude towards his background			0
he defiantly produced scores of landscapes depicting northern cities and the people that lived there , often seeking to show the working class way of life			0
@entity4 , artist in 1966 : new letters suggest that the famous @entity22 son might not have been quite as proud of his roots as previously thought more recently , he has been held up as a champion of the @entity3 by @entity52 and other arts organisations			1
but experts said that his relationship with @entity13 and its surrounding towns was much more complex than may people think			2
dr @entity58 said : ' @entity4 has now become a symbol for people who are keen to promote a new @entity22 identity			2
he is a symbol of the vibrancy and cultural wealth of @entity13			2
' but that 's not quite how he would have seen it in his lifetime			0
' when one looks at his paintings , the people are all dressed in the same drab clothing			0
they 're walking around in a daze against an industrial backdrop			0
' he is portrayed as a person celebrating the vibrancy of the working class north which is an interesting thing if he described it as a place of the dead			0
an oil on canvas work by @entity83 @entity82 artist @entity4 ' when people pass away they often end up being used to promote which ever agenda people seek to push			2
' the letter is going on sale for the first time after a close friend of the artist put it up for auction			0
it was written to his art critic friend @entity94 on october 19 , 1962 , from his then home in @entity97 - in @entity98			0
the note read : ' after about 10 days in @entity34 , @entity13 seems like a place of the dead - quite deserted in comparison			0
' @entity4 's note to @entity94 referred to an enclosed a letter also written by the painter to @entity94 's editor at @entity106 in which the artist wrote that his friend had ' revitalised ' the publication			1
@entity4 's @entity5 fair good friday 1946 it seems the artist posted both signed letters from @entity116 to @entity34 in the same envelope			1
the pair of letters are part of a single lot valued at between £ 700 and £ 1,000 by the auctioneers , @entity123 's , as part of a wider sale of other @entity127 artefacts , @entity128 , @entity129 & @entity130 this thursday			0
the current owner obtained the letters from mr @entity94 alongside other @entity4 keepsakes for his private @entity134 , who died in 1976 , was frequently mocked by the @entity34 - centric art world because he was a self - taught ' sunday painter '			1
the rent collector 's roots were firmly based in and around @entity13 , having been raised in @entity18 and attending college in @entity18 and @entity13 before finally earning recognition from the @entity34 - based art elite			1
earlier this year the capital doffed a belated flat cap to honour @entity4 with the first major exhibition to honour the world - renowned artist in 37 years			1
@entity149 's @entity4 and the @entity148 exhibition , which came to a close in october , aimed to re-examine the painter ' for a new and extended audience ' .			2

do *uncovered* writings reveal artist 's ' true feelings ' about @entity13 ?
@entity4 faced a backlash from art world for being ' too northern '
