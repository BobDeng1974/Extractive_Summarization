one of the most fascinating aspects of @entity2 ’s autobiography for the public must be the revealing of all the frailties and insecurities professional sportsmen feel in the dressing room			1
it ’s certainly not as harmonious or lovey - dovey as people might presume			1
players are always getting on each other ’s nerves or having issues to resolve			2
you hear professional footballers whingeing if they are away for longer than a couple of weeks at a @entity19 but international cricketers are away from home for months on end and see more of their team - mates than their families			1
the @entity38 footballers @entity39 and @entity40 famously did n’t get on and in my @entity42 team @entity44 and @entity45 had their moments , but that does n’t really matter			1
as i said in these pages the other day , @entity48 will tell you that some members of the great @entity52 side did n’t get on			0
@entity53 will say the same about his @entity55 team			2
but once they stepped on that field they respected each other and did everything in their power to win the game for their team			2
i liken it to sitting an examination every day of the week , and we all know how nervous and tetchy our kids can be the day before an exam			0
it is why there will always be niggles between team - mates and why they wo n’t always get on			1
team - mates @entity39 and @entity40 famously did n't get on at @entity38 i ’ve heard about the accusation of cliques in the @entity42 dressing room but that has always been the case and always will be			1
there will always be groups of three or four players who prefer to spend time with each other			0
when you are away for three months , you ca n’t expect everyone to go out together every night			0
you have to treat players like adults and in return they must have respect for one another even if they are not mates			0
there was plenty of banter and mickey - taking in the @entity42 dressing room when i played but someone like @entity97 , perhaps because he was teased about his weight when he was young , was always good at reminding anyone to be careful about not crossing the line			1
rarely would we have a go at each other about cricketing mistakes because it was all so important but @entity105 , for one , would always remind me if i got out to a bad shot			0
it was just that he would wait a few days before doing so			0
@entity44 ( left ) and @entity45 had their moments when @entity110 was @entity42 captain that is not bullying to me and i can honestly say i have never considered any cross words or mickey - taking in any @entity42 team i have played in — or watched — to be bullying			1
yes , the @entity42 team is a tough school but if you ca n’t cope with a few tough words from your team - mates how are you going to cope with @entity118 and @entity119 ? but i do agree with some of what @entity2 has said			1
i have long disagreed with how often the @entity42 bowlers would have a go at anyone who misfielded or dropped a catch and i was amazed at how long that was allowed to continue			1
apart from anything else it plays into the hands of the opposition			0
they will look at that and say : ‘ we ’ve got this lot on the run			0
they are at each other			0
’ it just was n’t a good look and i ’m glad that there seems less of that sort of thing now			0
@entity110 tried to embrace ‘ difficult characters ' like @entity143 when he was @entity42 captain and if it is true that people had to stand up in front of the group and apologise when they made a mistake then @entity42 should be careful			2
that really is school yard stuff			0
the flip side is that you want your team to be challenged and pushed to make sure they perform to the best of their ability , and it is not always the captain or the coach who does the challenging			0
for me , it would hit a lot harder if one of my team - mates , rather than the coach or captain , had a word with me after something and said : ‘ come on @entity171 , you can do better than that			1
’ clearly , this @entity42 team pushed each other hard and it seems @entity2 did n’t like to be treated in that way			1
it does seem that @entity42 may have had a tendency to overdo the methods that took them to three @entity180 triumphs and no 1 in the world test rankings			2
the admonishing of players in the field is one example			0
another is their reliance on statistics when , at times , they should have trusted their cricketing instinct more			0
when i was captain i would try to embrace the so - called ‘ difficult characters ’ and do everything to concentrate on what they could do rather than what they could n’t			0
if people like @entity143 , @entity45 and @entity199 could take wickets and score runs for us then they were fine by me			0
@entity203 ( right ) tried to keep @entity204 so @entity42 would benefit from his considerable talent you have to treat everyone differently			2
@entity2 and @entity208 have almost identical career records and are two of the best batsmen @entity42 have ever had , but as human beings they could not be more different and have to be treated as such			1
the key with @entity2 , clearly , was trying to keep him happy and make him feel loved			1
but coach @entity203 will tell you he did that for five years , he treated @entity2 differently and did everything to manage him and get him onside so @entity42 would benefit from the match - winning innings of which he was capable			1
it ’s all very well people saying @entity2 was easy to manage when he first came into the side but he would have been would n’t he ? he was a young player finding his way and there ’s no way he would have challenged anyone senior			1
@entity2 's lucrative contract with @entity227 had repercussions for @entity42 team where everything clearly changed is with the advent of the @entity227			1
it seemed to make @entity2 believe he was bigger than the team , and perhaps other players became jealous of the money he was making			1
the dynamic of one of the most successful of all @entity42 teams clearly changed			2
flower had tired of repeatedly trying to manage @entity2			2
when results started going against @entity42 and their star batsman was not quite looking like the player he once was , @entity42 decided enough was enough			2
as i have said , there are some valid points here but nearly everyone who has tried to manage him has found him incredibly hard work			0
everybody ca n’t be wrong			0
so maybe one day @entity2 might take a look at himself rather than blaming everyone else for the way he has been treated by @entity42			1
he might have to look back and say : ‘ was it me ? ’			0

@entity2 ’s autobiography has lifted the lid of all the frailties and insecurities professional sportsmen feel in the dressing room
international cricketers are away from home for months on end and see more of their team - mates than their families
there have always been cliques in the @entity42 dressing room and always will be
