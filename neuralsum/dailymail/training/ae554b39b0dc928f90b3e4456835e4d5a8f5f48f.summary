the children , between the ages of 8 and 11 , fell ill yesterday soon after eating their school lunch in @entity19 , a village 50 miles north of the state capital of @entity21			1

eight of them were in a serious condition			0
the deaths have sparked violent protests in @entity56 in the @entity58 district , where four police cars were set on fire during a demonstration by parents and hundreds of villagers			1
treatment : the meal was cooked in the school kitchen , but school authorities stopped serving it as children started vomiting authorities suspended an official in charge of the free meal scheme in the school and registered a case of criminal negligence against the school headmaster , who fled as soon as the children fell ill. @entity79 , the state education minister , said a preliminary investigation suggested the food had traces of an organophosphate used as an insecticide on rice and wheat crops			1
it 's believed the grain was not washed before it was served at the school , he said			0
