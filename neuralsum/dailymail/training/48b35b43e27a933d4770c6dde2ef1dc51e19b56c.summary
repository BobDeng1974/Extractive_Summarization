by @entity1 reporter published : 21:17 est , 12 june 2013 updated : 01:14 est , 13 june 2013 a company called @entity3 is putting a new - pardon the pun - spin on a 5,500 - year - old classic : the wheel			1
wheels , as most everyone knows , are round			0
but not @entity8 - rather , a @entity9 , designed for skateboards , is formed around a cubed center , which its inventor claims allows it to ride faster and smoother than your traditional round skateboard wheel			1
in other words , the company has literally reinvented the wheel			0
' this allows for less energy to be used as the contact patch is very small			0
conversely , a wheel that would normally work well as a low resistance wheel would perform poorly in something like soft sand			0
' shark wheels are made up of three , helical - shaped strips that , when rolling , form a sine wave pattern when they make contact with the ground			1
this pattern allows the wheel to roll faster than a traditional round wheel , the company claims , and provides better handling on rough , wet terrain			2
the man who reinvented the wheel : @entity50 says he 's been an avid skateboarder all his life ' it kept on going ' : @entity50 says he dropped this ' rectangle ' accidentally and noticed that it rolled ' when encountering soft surfaces , the patented design of the @entity9 produces a much wider , high friction profile which creates a wide surface area and unsurpassed grip , the company says			1
' this ability to travel on soft surfaces is very similar to the way a sidewinder snake moves through the sand			0
' @entity9 inventor @entity50 says he got the idea for the wheel when he used six different shapes to form a perfect cube			1
he dropped the cube accidentally and it rolled			0
' not only did it roll , ' he says in a promotional video for the @entity9 , ' it kept on going			2
the helix shape of it was perfectly balanced so no matter what the terrain , it kept on going			0
' shark wheels lame : round wheels are sooo 3000 b.c. sidewinder : @entity50 says the @entity9 works similar to how a ' sidewinder snake moves through the sand ' the company recently started a campaign on @entity28 - an online fundraising website where the general public can contribute money to creative ideas - that already has garnered more than $ 30,000 in 10 days			1
the company 's initial fundraising goal was $ 10,000			2
@entity50 says the company already has plans for the wheel designed and tested			0
he says it will use the money from @entity28 to start mass - producing the square - shaped wheels soon .			1

' @entity97 ' are made of three , helical - shaped strips that , when rolling , form a sine wave pattern when they make contact with the ground
the inventor of the @entity9 says he came up with the idea accidentally
the company already has raised more than $ 30,000 and plans to start mass - producing the wheels soon
