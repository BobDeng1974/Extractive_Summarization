' i felt the pinch , grabbed the spider and pulled it off , ' he said			2
' at the time it was n’t painful , just a gentle sting			1
' but just hours later , the bite on his ankle had become red and itchy and his leg ballooned to three times its normal size			1
his gp prescribed antihistamines to help the allergic reaction and then antibiotics			0
now in excruciating pain , mr @entity3 's family forced him to go to @entity36			0

' ' they told me that if i had n’t gone to hospital i could have needed my foot amputated			1
' although medical professionals have not commented on the type of spider bite he suffered , mr @entity65 and his wife @entity66 are convinced it was a ‘ @entity69 ’ spider with a bulbous , shiny black back			1
doctors have told him he faces another six months of treatment to recover fully			1
now back home , he is undergoing negative pressure vacuum wound treatment to get more of the infection out			0

' the false widow spider , which is said to be spreading further north due to warmer weather , has the worst bite of any spider in the @entity93			2
@entity95 of the @entity96 and about the size of a 50 pence piece , the spider came to the @entity93 more than 100 years ago in crates of fruit from the @entity101			2
false widow spiders are distinctive for their shiny , black flesh , bulbous bodies , thick legs and skull - like patterns			0
millions of false widows , @entity93 's most venomous spider , have been found across the @entity93 and the population is believed to be growing			0
the species has a brown bulbous abdomen with cream markings that look like a skull			0
they have long legs and can reach about 15mm in size			0
also known as steatoda nobilis , the spider is frequently confused for the black widow , which has deadly venom			0
the false widow was first spotted in the @entity93 in @entity124 , @entity125 , in 1879 , and it is understood that it may have made its way to these shores from @entity128 or the @entity101 in a shipment of bananas			0
the @entity131 says that warmer summers mean the spider is spreading northwards through the @entity93 , having been found mainly in southern @entity134 .			0

@entity65 , 41 , saw the spider while clearing out his shed four weeks ago
unafraid of creepy crawlies , he let it run past him - but it bit his ankle
bite went from being a ' gentle sting ' to him having a severely swollen leg
was told had he waited much longer to seek treatment , he may have needed the leg amputated
