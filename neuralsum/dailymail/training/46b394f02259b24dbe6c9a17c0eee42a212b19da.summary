the muslin swaddling cloth that his proud parents bought @entity10 for his first public appearance sold out in less than four hours			1
and it seems the youngest royal , who was tightly wrapped in the cloth when he left the @entity15 of @entity16 , has sparked a renewed interest in the age - old tradition of swaddling itself			1
trendsetter : @entity21 seemed to be tightly wrapped in his first official photo it is not known if the @entity24 and @entity25 have actually decided to swaddle their baby , or if they simply used the @entity27 + @entity29 cloth as a wrap			1

‘ last week , on a visit to her local clinic , she was sternly told off for doing so as it is against guidelines			0
‘ my daughter now has a note on her file saying that she is swaddling her baby against professional advice and is willing to put her baby ’s life at risk by doing so			1
’ she added : ‘ what should she do – follow the advice of health professionals or the example of royalty ? ’ mothers on parenting websites also said they had been told not to swaddle by health visitors and nurses – who warned them that their babies ’ development would suffer if they were wrapped up			1
some said they had been told that official guidance now said babies should not be swaddled			0
but a @entity93 spokesman confirmed that there have been no national guidelines issued about swaddling			2
one exasperated mother wrote : ‘ this is so confusing			2
do we or do n’t we ? the changing guidelines make me quite anxious sometimes			0
’ @entity101 , from the @entity102 , said : ‘ it is not straightforward , there is evidence for and against swaddling			2
