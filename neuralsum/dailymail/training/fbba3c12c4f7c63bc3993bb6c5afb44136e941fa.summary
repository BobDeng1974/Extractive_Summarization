an extraordinary collection of propaganda posters from the @entity2 reveals how the authorities aimed to convince the public that @entity5 was bound to defeat the @entity6			1
the historic artworks blare out the message that ' victory of the @entity10 is assured ' - but still urged @entity5 to hoard their kitchen waste for farm animals and keep a sharp eye out for foreign spies			1
the rousing posters , some of which are written in @entity18 and @entity19 , are being sold at auction later this month and are expected to fetch around £ 7,000			1
mixed messages : some propaganda from the @entity2 emphasised the strength of the @entity10 , but others urged @entity5 to remain thrifty warning : one series of posters shows @entity5 chatting about the war overheard by nefarious characters , and a deadly results of ' careless talk ' multi-lingual : most of the posters are aimed at the @entity5 themselves , but others aim to reach allies by using foreign languages such as @entity37 , right they show fictional scenes such as @entity40 tanks destroying their @entity42 opponents , marine commandos storming an occupied village and @entity46 bombers striking @entity48 factories			1
others feature the capture of a @entity48 u-boat and a @entity5 navy cruiser ramming an @entity54 submarine			1
a series of posters aimed at the @entity5 's @entity18 allies , many of whom had little idea about the progress of the war , says : ' the fall of the dictators is assured '			1
@entity5 citizens were urged to save scraps of food to feed to chickens , and set up clubs to breed pigs			1
and chilling images from the famous ' careless talk costs lives ' campaign dramatise the deadly consequences of being overheard discussing war plans			2
quirky : these posters urge thrifty householders to recycle their kitchen scraps so they could be fed to pigs which would then be slaughtered @entity82 : many of the posters are aimed at convincing @entity40 citizens that their armies were much stronger than the @entity88 posters attractive : some of the well - designed posters appeal for help for the @entity91 , which was vital in maintaining @entity40 supply lines moral support : some of the posters produced by the @entity96 urge members of the public to show their support for the troops some of the posters have come from an archive belonging to @entity102 , head of the @entity103 responsible for producing the patriotic artwork			0
the collection of around 30 posters is going under the hammer at @entity108 in @entity109 , @entity110 on december 20			0
@entity112 @entity111 said : ' these propaganda posters are a fascinating reminder of the lengths the @entity103 went to to boost moral among troops and civilians			0
' they are cartoon - like and all of them depict strong images of the @entity10 beating the @entity6			0
' a lot of the posters would have been sent abroad to places like unoccupied @entity18 , @entity124 and @entity125 where troops would have had little idea of how the war was going in other areas			2
on sale : the evocative posters are expected to fetch £ 7,000 when they go up for auction in @entity110 next week chilling : these images dramatically illustrate how damaging the consequences of talking about the war effort could be thanks : the @entity91 launched a propaganda campaign to highlight its own importance to the war effort ' they would have served as little newsflashes to reassure soldiers that the @entity10 were winning the war			1
' in some cases they would have been sent out when things were looking grim for the @entity10 as a way of boosting moral			0
' a chunk of the posters concentrated on the @entity149 - those who stayed behind to keep the country running			0
' every citizen was expected to do their bit for the war effort and so posters were put up on hoardings and in bus and railway stations urging them to do so			1
' the " dig for victory " campaign was designed to get people to be self sufficient and part of that was rearing chickens and pigs			0
' some of the more charming posters urge people to start " pig clubs " and feed food scraps to chickens			0
write caption here artistic : the posters are mostly based on evocative paintings paired with striking and readable text back them up : the heroic image of inevitable victory projected by the posters was somewhat misleading given the ups and downs of the war ' however , the " careless talk costs lives " series was probably the most successful propaganda campaign of the war			2
' these days social networking makes it almost impossible to control information but back then the @entity103 was very keen to keep a tight lid on things			0
' posters were put up in public places including pubs and village halls with very obvious warnings not to gossip about anything to do with the war			2
' to deter people the posters showed the scenes of devastation that would certainly have come true had @entity203 gotten wind of any gossip			0
' there is a very strong market for war posters and we expect there to be lots of interest in the sale			2

*proganda* posters were meant to raise morale while urging @entity5 to stay *vigilant* and help the war effort
the amazing haul is expected to fetch around £ 7,000 when it goes up for auction later this month
