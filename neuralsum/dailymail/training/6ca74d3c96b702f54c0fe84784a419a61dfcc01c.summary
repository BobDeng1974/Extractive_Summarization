by @entity0 holograms have featured in futuristic sci - fi films for decades , from @entity3 to @entity4 and @entity5 , but @entity6 could be about to make the technology mainstream - and small enough to fit in your pocket			0
new @entity6 patent files detail a display that appears to float 3d images , or holograms , above it , and these holograms can then be moved using finger gestures			1
the process involves a system that creates the 3d image , an optical system that puts this image into the air , and a touch sensor			1
the patent details a display that appears to float 3d images , or holograms , above it and these holograms can then be moved using finger gestures and swipes			1
it involves a system that creates the @entity19 , an optical system that puts this image into the air , and an optical or acoustic sensor according to the application , the hologram is created using infrared lasers - or similar device - that project the image onto a surface above the display			1
this projection would then appear via the optical system , which could be situated between two parabolic or concave mirrors that have reflective surfaces facing each other			2
when infrared light beams strikes an external object , such as the user ’s finger , the files explain that the light will be reflected towards a series of sensors			0
these optical sensors could include images sensors , cameras or other light - based sensors			0
the @entity62 published the ‘ interactive three - dimensional display system , ’ patent on thursday and it was found by @entity63			1
according to the application , the hologram is created using infrared lasers - or similar devices - that project the image onto a surface above the display			0
the files said : ‘ if desired , there may be one , two , three , four , or more than four projectors in [ the ] display system			2
‘ each projector may include a single monochromatic laser , may include multiple monochromatic lasers of the same colour , or may include multiple monochromatic lasers of different colours such as a red , green , and blue for producing colour images			0
’ this projection would then appear via the optical system , which could be situated between two parabolic or concave mirrors that have reflective surfaces facing each other			2
@entity6 's patented system is slightly different to the 3d display @entity92 is rumoured to be working on			1
the first pictures of @entity92 's @entity94 were revealed last week , pictured , and appeared to feature four cameras and retina - tracking technology that are used to create a ' floating screen ' effect when infrared light beams strike an external object , such as the user ’s finger , the files explain that the light will be reflected towards a series of sensors			1
these optical sensors could include images sensors , cameras or other light - based sensors			0
the files also state acoustic - based ultrasonic sensors or capacitive sensors could work to locate and track the movement of the finger so the @entity19 ' floating ' object can be fully manipulated			0
@entity92 is similarly said to be working on a 3d display for an upcoming device , but its system is slightly different to the one @entity6 has patented			1
the first pictures of @entity92 's @entity94 , revealed last week , appeared to feature four cameras used to create the ' floating screen ' effect			0
set to be unveiled in june , the device is rumoured to use retina - tracking technology to make images on the smartphone 's display appear to ' float above the screen like a hologram and appear three - dimensional at all angles			2

' interactive 3d display system ' patent was published thursday
it details a display that appears to float 3d images , or holograms , above it
these holograms can then be moved using finger gestures and swipes
the process involves a system that creates the @entity19 , an optical system that puts this image into the air , and an optical or acoustic sensor
technology would be similar to that seen on @entity92 ’s rumoured @entity19 phone
