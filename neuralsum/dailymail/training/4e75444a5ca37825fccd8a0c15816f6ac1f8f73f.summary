by @entity0 giant cruise ships are set to return to @entity3 ’s historic waterways , just months after they were banned			1
a government decree that took effect in january had banned the eyesore of the behemoths passing through the canals because of the risk of damage to the ancient channels			1
but the administrative court of @entity3 accepted an appeal by lobbyists , including the city 's port , and suspended the ban because of ‘ the absence of any practical alternative navigation routes ’			1
ahoy there : @entity23 liner @entity21 glides through @entity3 more than 600 cruise ships bearing 1.7million passengers passed in front of @entity27 in 2012 , a figure which grew seven per cent last year			1
most were day trippers who barely contributed to the local economy			0
the judges ruled that there was ‘ not sufficient preliminary research identifying risks connected to transits of ships over 40,000 tonnes in the canals in question '			2
the lifting of the ban immediately provoked outcry			0
@entity43 spokesman @entity42 said the decision ' allows the transit of real and actual floating skyscrapers exposing a city unique to the world to extremely high risk '			0
water sight : the view of @entity3 for cruise ship passengers is brilliant but some complain that they contribute little to the local economy as they often stay on board while docked ( pictured is the @entity56 ) @entity57 of a controversy : the huge ships , sometimes ten storeys high , erode the waterways and the city ¿ s fragile foundations ( pictured is the @entity63 ) she added : ‘ we demand the intermediate intervention of the government with a law to limit the access of cruise ships into the lagoon			1
to save @entity3 is to save the heritage of all @entity73			2
' environment minister @entity74 said that he believed it was ‘ still possible to find a solution as soon as possible to avoid the continual presence of big ships in the ancient canals of @entity3			1
’ @entity3 ’s proud residents have long been up in arms about the presence of large cruise ships passing through the canals the huge ships , sometimes ten storeys high , erode the waterways and the city ’s fragile foundations , contribute to the worsening flooding that occurs every winter and damage the delicate eco-systems of the lagoon			1
the cruise companies pay huge port fees for the privilege , but their passengers frequently eat and sleep on board and contribute little direct revenue to restaurants and hotels			2
@entity3 ’s mayor @entity101 wants to see cruise tourists dock at @entity103 , a town in the province of @entity3 long blighted by industrial pollution			2
other suggestions have included a floating off - shore port			0
alternative solutions would see the number of cruise ships allowed to enter the lagoon severely limited , or the dredging of a new approach to the same cruise passenger terminals but avoiding the narrow canals around @entity116			1
tensions were raised last summer after the @entity118 , which is owned by the same parent company as the notorious @entity120 , allegedly passed within yards of the city ’s bank while performing ‘ a sail by salute ’ to a major company shareholder			0
film footage appeared to show the 110,000 - ton liner squeezing a vaporetto water taxi and other boats between the ship and the bank			0
the ban on large cruise liners was accompanied by a crackdown on water traffic , after the death of a @entity140 tourist last year			0
@entity141 , 50 , a professor of criminal law , was crushed against a dock by a reversing vaporetto water bus , as he took a tour with his family by gondola near the @entity148			0
the tragic accident prompted authorities to bring in a series of new safety regulations including breathalyser tests for gondoliers and ‘ a floating congestion zone ’ on the @entity156 to ease the chaotic rush hour traffic .			0
