one of the world ’s oldest complete human skeletons has been found in a cave in @entity3 - and sheds new light on who the first @entity5 were			1
named ‘ @entity8 ’ , the remains belong to a 15 - 16 girl who went underground to seek water 13,000 years ago during the last ice age			1
she plunged to her death in a large pit known as ‘ @entity14 ’ , @entity15 for ‘ black hole ’ , in @entity3 ’s @entity17			1
she carefully brushes the human skull found at the site while her team members take detailed photographs of the skull of @entity27 , the remains belong to a 15 - 16 girl who went underground to seek water 13,000 years ago during the last ice age			1
deciphering the ancestry of the first people to populate the @entity34 has been a challenge , researchers say - and the discovery of @entity8 is a major step forward			1
on the basis of genetics , modern @entity5 are thought to descend from @entity40 who moved into eastern @entity41 ( the landmass connecting @entity43 and @entity44 ) between 26,000 and 18,000 years ago			1
when sea levels rose after the last ice age the land bridge disappeared			1
these people , the earliest @entity5 , then spread southward			0
she roamed @entity49 up to 13,000 years ago when the now flooded cave systems in @entity3 ’s @entity17 were much the same , apart from the water level being much lower than it is now			1
her almost complete remains , including an intact skull and preserved dna , were lying 130 feet below sea level near a variety of extinct animals , such as an elephant like creature called a gomphothere			2
these helped scientists establish the age of the bones as between 12,000 and 13,000 years old			2
her pristine preservation enabled the researchers to extract enough dna to establish the prehistoric girl was an ancestor of the earliest @entity5 , who arrived from north east @entity43 between 15,000 and 20,000 years ago , and modern @entity5			1
the ancestry of the earliest @entity5 is still debated because the facial features of the oldest @entity72 skeletons do n't look much like those of modern @entity5			2
' @entity74 closely resemble people of @entity76 , @entity77 , and @entity78 , ' @entity79 , lead author on the study , said , ' but the oldest @entity72 skeletons do not			0
' they have longer , narrower crania than later @entity5 , and smaller , shorter faces , too - more closely resembling modern peoples of @entity85 , @entity86 , and the @entity87			2
' this has led to speculation that perhaps the first @entity5 and native americans came from different homelands , ' @entity79 continued , ' or migrated from @entity43 at different stages in their evolution			1
' @entity8 's skull as it was found ( left ) and the tooth that researchers analysed to find out about her life the new find suggests that @entity44 was not colonized by separate migration events from different parts of @entity101			1
rather , the earliest @entity5 represent an early population expansion out of @entity41			0
on the basis of genetics , modern @entity5 are thought to descend from @entity40 who moved into eastern @entity41 ( the landmass connecting @entity43 and @entity44 ) between 26,000 and 18,000 years ago			1
about 12,000 years ago @entity49 experienced a great climactic change , when the melting of the ice caps caused a dramatic rise in global sea levels , which flooded low lying coastal landscapes and cave systems			2
many of the subterranean spaces that once provided people and animals with water and shelter became inundated and lost until the advent of cave diving			0
the @entity121 cave system on @entity3 's @entity122			1
' @entity14 is a more than 100 - foot - deep , bell - shaped , water - filled void about the size of a professional basketball arena deep inside a drowned cave system , , ' said @entity79 , lead author on the study			2
' only technical cave divers can reach the bottom			0
the @entity121 cave system on @entity3 's @entity122			1
' first they must climb down a 30 - foot ladder in a nearby sinkhole ; then they swim along 200 feet of tunnel to the pit rim before making a final 100 - foot drop			2
' the divers are the astronauts of this project ; we scientists are their mission control			0
' like nearby caves , @entity14 was accessible only via sinkhole ; people and animals fell in and were trapped			0
then , starting about 10,000 years ago , global glaciers melted , filling the caves with water			2
in addition to the near - complete human skeleton , the researchers found the remains of 26 large mammals , including extinct taxa such as sabertooths and gomphotheres			1
these people , the earliest @entity5 , then spread southward			0
chatters and colleagues were delighted with their find : ' this project is exciting on so many fronts : the beautiful cave , the incredibly well - preserved animal skeletons , the completeness of the human skeleton , the success of our innovative dating approach , ' he said			2
' but for me , " he said , ' what is most exciting is that we finally have an answer , after 20 years , to a question that has plagued me since my first look at @entity174 : ' who were the first @entity5 ? '' complicating the puzzle , it 's been very difficult to find intact @entity179 skeletons for study			2
' @entity179 skeletons are rare for several reasons , ' @entity79 explained			0
' the people themselves were few ; they were highly nomadic and seem to have buried or cremated the dead where they fell , making the locations of graves unpredictable ; also , geologic processes have destroyed or deeply buried their graves			0
' divers @entity191 and @entity19 transport the @entity194 skull to an underwater turntable so that it can be photographed in order to create a 3 - d model			2
the analysis of @entity8 analysis revealed a haplotype common to modern @entity5 , subhaplogroup @entity201			1
this genetic signature occurs only in the @entity34 , likely having developed in @entity41 after populations there split from other @entity43			1
the sample shows that individuals of the @entity208 era with @entity210 - derived @entity209 traveled far and wide through the @entity34 , all the way down to @entity3 , for example			1
critically , it shows that despite differences in craniofacial form , this early @entity72 woman was related to modern @entity5 ; the differences in craniofacial form are probably best explained as evolutionary changes that happened after the divergence of @entity222 from their @entity224 ancestors , the authors say			1
their work suggests that @entity44 was not colonized by separate migration events from different parts of @entity101			0
divers @entity19 and @entity191 search the walls of @entity14 , an underwater cave on @entity232 s @entity122 where the remains of @entity8 were found			1
the caves of the @entity17 became a sacred place for the @entity237 civilisation that established itself about 10,000 years later			0
rather , the earliest @entity5 represent an early population expansion out of @entity41			0
this aligns with the hypothesis that both @entity179 and native americans derive from a single source population			1
the caves of the @entity17 became a sacred place for the @entity237 civilisation that established itself about 10,000 years later			0
cave diving scientist dr @entity244 , of @entity245 in the @entity72 , said : ' the preservation of all the bones in this deep water filled cave is amazing			0
@entity191 at 145 - ft depth in @entity251 , inspecting a forelimb of an extinct @entity254 ground sloth , one of two sloth species found in the cave			2
the @entity254 ground sloth has not previously been found so far south in the @entity34			1
' the bones are beautifully laid out			0
' the girl ’s skeleton is exceptionally complete because of the environment in which she died			0
she ended up in the right water and in a quiet place without any soil			0
' dr @entity244 , whose findings were published in the journal @entity269 , has hovered underwater above the skeleton ’s site since its discovery in 2011 , and prospected in the area			0
she said : ' @entity14 is a very complex site			0
assessing the skeleton 's age required a novel approach given the challenging environmental conditions			2
the research team analyzed tooth enamel and bat - dropped seeds using radiocarbon dating and calcite deposits found on the bones using the uranium - thorium method , establishing an age of between 12,000 and 13,000 years			1
analyses of dna extracted from the skeleton 's wisdom tooth found it belonged to an @entity43 - derived lineage that occurs only in @entity44 ( haplogroup d , subhaplogroup @entity201 )			1
finding a skeleton with dna from one of @entity44 's founding lineages in @entity298 greatly expands the geographic distribution of confirmed @entity222 among the earliest @entity5			1
' by understanding the formation of the shallow caves and the shaft into which the girl fell , we know the girl and the animals visited a site that looks almost like it does today , except the water level was down in the bottom of the shaft			0
' the skeletons in @entity251 have valuable rock crystals lying on them , including a new form dr @entity244 calls ‘ florets ’ in recognition of their bushy nature and one inch size			0
@entity14 is a black abyss in the state of @entity322 that is completely filled with water			0
it can only be reached by divers travelling more than 4,000 feet through underwater passages using underwater propulsion vehicles , or scooters , which enable them to cover long distances			0
it is about 200 feet deep and 120 feet wide and is located inside the @entity334 cave system			0
@entity8 's skull as it was found : @entity14 is a black abyss in the state of @entity322 that is completely filled with water			1
it can only be reached by divers travelling more than 4,000 feet through underwater passages using underwater propulsion vehicles , or scooters , which enable them to cover long distances			0
the skull and bones are clearly visible on the floor of the underwater cave once you enter the limestone pit you can not see the floor below , and all that can be seen in front is a black void			1
dr @entity244 added : ' research in flooded caves is much like space exploration , with divers similar to astronauts reporting back to ‘ mission control ’ , a much larger scientific team at the surface			0
' it all has to be done on @entity363 , which is our life support system			0
' our science team has been supported by a great number of dedicated non-science cave divers who have committed hundreds of hours at very dangerous depths to complete this exploration			0
” deciphering the ancestry of the first people to populate the @entity34 has been a challenge , researchers say			2
the earliest modern human bones unearthed to date are pieces of human skull from ‘ the @entity378 ’ in @entity379 that are up to 63,000 - years - old .			1

skeleton is of a very delicately built woman measuring only 4 ' 10 " tall .
named ' @entity8 ' by the dive team , she is *estimated* to have been between 15 and 16 years old and plunged to her death in a large pit in @entity3
dna extracted from wisdom tooth found it belonged to an @entity43 - derived lineage - but that @entity8 is related to modern native americans
shape of @entity8 's skull and the dna in her bones shows there was only one major migration to the @entity34 , over an *ancient* land bridge that *spanned* what is now the @entity402
