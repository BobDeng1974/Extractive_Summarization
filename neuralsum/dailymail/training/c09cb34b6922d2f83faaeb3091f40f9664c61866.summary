' @entity7 grew up on the farm of her dad @entity66 , 53 , and mother @entity67 , 49 , near @entity68 , in the @entity70 borders , and was helping round up sheep as soon as she could walk			1
one girl and her dogs : @entity7 also takes part in international sheepdog trials but the family ’s idyllic life turned sour with the outbreak of foot and mouth disease which devastated their flock			1

she said : ' when i first saw the farm it was very run - down but there were lots of people looking around wanting to buy it			1
i do n’t know why the @entity89 chose me over older , more experienced farmers with families			0
maybe it was because of my enthusiasm			0
farming is in my blood and i like a challenge			0
' @entity7 took out a £ 10,000 bank loan and moved in that winter			2

rural living : the shepherdess has no mains gas or electricity at her hill tip farm she has only been on one holiday since taking over the farm as she does n't like to leave her animals for more than one night			1
socialising can also be difficult because of her remote abode			0
' i like to go for a drink with my friends once a week but it takes about 45 minutes to get to the pub and i ca n’t drink because i ’m usually driving , ' she said			2
' i tried to have a house party when i first moved in but the generator broke and the lights went out , the whole thing was a disaster			0
needless to say i have n’t had one since			0
' but the shepherdess is keen to start dating in the hope of finding mr @entity147			2
' i can still go out , it just takes me longer to get there , ' she said			0
for prospective dates , @entity7 describes herself as ' quite a girly girl '			2
she adds : ' some shepherdesses walk like men , talk like men , dress like men and do n’t wear any make - up			0
' but i always wear make - up and although i go around in a weather - beaten outdoor jacket i ’ve always tried to stay quite feminine			0
