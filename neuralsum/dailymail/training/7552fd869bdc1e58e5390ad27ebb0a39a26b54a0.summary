women in the small town of @entity2 , southwest @entity3 , have reportedly gone on their second sex strike in two years dubbed the ' crossed leg movement ' , demanding that the roads to their remote region be repaved ' if you 're going to send a container of @entity3 goods to @entity32 , it will cost you more to bring it to a @entity3 port than to get it from that @entity3 port all the way across the other side of the world to @entity32 , ' mr @entity15 explained			1
women in the town first began withholding sex in 2011 to protest the poor condition of the road , where judge @entity44 joined the strike after seeing a young woman die along with her unborn child because the ambulance got stuck on the road and failed to reach a hospital in time			1
strike leader @entity51 said at the time : ' why bring children into this world when they can just die without medical attention and we ca n't even offer them the most basic rights ? we decided to stop having sex and stop having children until the state fulfils its previous promises			2
' women in the town first began withholding sex in 2011 ( pictured ) to protest the poor condition of the road the single road is in such poor condition that trips to the nearest hospital take up to 14 hours , and many people in need of care die along the way after three months and 19 days of abstinence , town politicians promised the road would be repaired and the government pledged $ 21million to pave at least half of the 35 - mile road			2
but after two years and no change , women resumed the strike			0
now it seems the @entity81 have brought in bulldozers and ' heavy machinery ' to prove they will indeed rebuild the road			0
but completion of the project , and simple maintenance of roads in @entity3 , means working against difficult terrain , such as in the @entity92 mountains , and a decade - old guerrilla war .			0

it *'s* the second time in two years that women in the small town of @entity2 , southwest @entity3 , have gone on a sex strike
