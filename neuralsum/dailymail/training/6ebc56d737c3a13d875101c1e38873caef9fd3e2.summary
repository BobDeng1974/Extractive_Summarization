as many as a quarter of a million @entity1 users may have had their personal details stolen by hackers , after the social media giant became the latest victim in a string of high - profile cyber attacks			1
@entity1 , which has over 200 million active users worldwide , admitted in a blog posting earlier this week it had detected attempts to gain access to its user data			1
while the site shut down one attack moments after it was detected , it discovered the ' extremely sophisticated ' hackers may have managed to access user names , e-mail addresses and encrypted passwords belonging to 250,000 users			1
hacked : @entity1 said friday that it had become the latest victim in a number of high - profile cyber-attacks against media companies , saying that hackers may have gained access to information on 250,000 of its more than 200 million active users @entity1 reset the pilfered passwords and has said all affected users would receive an e-mail notifying them that they need to create a new password			1
@entity1 is not the only media company frantically reassessing its information security ; @entity35 firms including the @entity36 , @entity37 and the @entity38 have also fallen victim to hackers			1
the @entity35 publications say their computer systems were targeted by hackers in @entity44			0
the @entity36 revealed its computer systems were infiltrated over a period of four months , during which time its reporters were investigating the huge fortune of @entity44 premier @entity49			0
the newspaper believes the hackers were trying to monitor its coverage of the premier - a claim denied by the @entity44 government			2
meanwhile the @entity37 announced it had carried out a complete overhaul of its systems after discovering it too had been the target of @entity44 - based cyber attacks			1
it said the hackers who breached its system were also trying to gain information about reporting activity and sources being used for the publication 's @entity44 coverage			2
yesterday the @entity38 revealed it had brought in consultants from the @entity68 and the @entity69 after hackers targeted three servers and numerous desktops for more than half of last year			0
it also alleges @entity44 hackers were behind the prolonged breach			0
the network was awash with tweets about the cyber attack today as the extent of the security breach came to light			2
one user , under the handle @ @entity83 , posted : ' if there are strange things going on with your account it 's because @entity1 has been hacked - big time ! ' the online attack comes on the heels of recent hacks into the computer systems of @entity35 media and technology companies , including the @entity36 and @entity37			1
both @entity35 newspapers reported this week that their computer systems had been infiltrated by @entity44 - based hackers , likely to monitor media coverage the @entity44 government deems important			1
@entity102 , @entity1 's director of information security , said the breach was the work of ' extremely sophisticated ' attackers			1
' this attack was not the work of amateurs , and we do not believe it was an isolated incident ... and we believe other companies and organisations have also been recently similarly attacked , ' he said in a blog post			0
‘ for that reason we felt that it was important to publicize this attack while we still gather information , and we are helping government and federal law enforcement in their effort to find and prosecute these attackers to make the @entity121 safer for all users , ' mr @entity102 added			2
@entity44 has been accused of mounting a widespread , aggressive cyber-spying campaign for several years , trying to steal classified information and corporate secrets and to intimidate critics			0
the @entity44 foreign ministry could not be reached for comment saturday , but the @entity44 government has said those accusations are baseless and that @entity44 itself is a victim of cyber-attacks			0
‘ @entity44 law forbids hacking and any other actions that damage internet security , ’ the @entity133 recently said			0
‘ the @entity44 military has never supported any hacking activities			0
’ professional job : @entity1 said in its blog that the attack ' was not the work of amateurs , and we do not believe it was an isolated incident			2
' ( @entity1 's ceo @entity146 pictured ) gauging the damage : @entity1 is generally used to broadcast messages to the public , so the hacking might not immediately have yielded any important secrets one expert said that the @entity1 hack probably happened after an employee 's home or work computer was compromised through vulnerabilities in @entity158 , a commonly used computing language whose weaknesses have been well publicized			2
@entity162 , an independent privacy and security researcher , said such a move would give attackers ‘ a toehold ’ in @entity1 's internal network , potentially allowing them either to sniff out user information as it traveled across the company 's system or break into specific areas , such as the authentication servers that process users ' passwords			1
in a telephone interview on friday , @entity162 said that the relatively small number of users affected suggested either that attackers were n't on the network long or that they were only able to compromise a subset of the company 's servers			0
@entity1 is generally used to broadcast messages to the public , so the hacking might not immediately have yielded any important secrets			0
but the stolen credentials could be used to eavesdrop on private messages or track which internet address a user is posting from			0
that might be useful , for example , for an authoritarian regime trying to keep tabs on a journalist 's movements			0
‘ more realistically , someone could use that as an entry point into another service , ’ @entity162 said , noting that since few people bother using different passwords for different services , a password stolen from @entity1 might be just as handy for reading a journalist 's emails			1
sophisticated hackers : ' the attackers were extremely sophisticated , and we believe other companies and organizations have also been recently similarly attacked , ' @entity1 's blog read			1
