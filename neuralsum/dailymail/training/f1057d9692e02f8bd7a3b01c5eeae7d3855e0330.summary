by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter published : 03:41 est , 2 july 2012 updated : 19:49 est , 2 july 2012 police officers have told of their terror during a ‘ living hell ’ in the riots last summer			1
they were threatened with guns and machetes as the violence left them in fear of their lives and feeling like they were ‘ in a movie ’			0
riot teams were left hopelessly outnumbered as reinforcements were not mobilised by senior officers quickly enough , added officers			2
many fear rioting could erupt again this summer because of continuing social unease			2
summer of chaos : @entity22 burns to the ground in @entity24 , south @entity25 , during four days of rioting in the capital last summer show of strength : the disorder eventually came to an end when 16,000 officers were sent out on the streets of @entity25 after four nights of chaos but they warned that efforts to counter trouble would be hampered by budget cuts			1
a superintendent in @entity41 said : ‘ we arrested 300 people but a lot of people on the periphery got away with it			0
‘ probably , if i was them , i ’d have thought “ yeah , i ’d do it again , and probably get away with it next time ”			0
’ the anonymous accounts from more than 130 officers in eight forces were collected in interviews by researchers			1
' i think if you have bad economic times , hot weather , some sort of an event that sets it off ... my answer is : yes , it could ( happen again )			0
' ' because i do n't think anything has changed between now and last august , and the only thing that 's different is people have thought : riots are fun			2
' they had been on the front line as the riots spread across @entity25 , @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity41 and @entity74 in august 2011			1
many officers said they were astonished no - one was killed as rioters armed themselves with knives , sticks and makeshift weapons			1
nearly all the police interviewed described the unrest as the greatest physical and psychological challenge of their careers			1
violence : a rioter hurls a rock at riot police in @entity88 as a car burns during the disorder last summer looted : a woman is detained outside a @entity93 store in @entity94 last summer as riot police are deployed to try and bring the chaos to a halt a 33 - year - old senior officer said rioters tried to roll burning cars at colleagues in @entity25			1
he said : ‘ you can not believe this is happening in an area of @entity88 where people go and have a cup of coffee			0
this is @entity25 , it ’s not @entity109			1
‘ the lawlessness was just unbelievable			0
and there seemed to be this anti-police feeling , even from people whose property we were trying to protect			0
’ in @entity117 , a 52 - year - old senior officer said his riot helmet was split in half by a block of masonry which knocked him unconscious			0
he said : ‘ i had a splitting headache			0
there was no other option but to remain on duty and do my duty			0
i was at the sharp end for just over four hours , no respite			0
a superintendent from @entity130 ‘ i had no doubt that if an officer had become detached from the main body and taken off on their own , they would ’ve been killed			2
’ a 35 - year - old sergeant in @entity73 said battling rioters was like a scene from the film @entity140			0
he said : ‘ three hundred people came round the corner and started attacking us			0
as i had my visor down , it was like watching a tv screen			0
’ the project was carried out by the @entity148 and @entity149			0
a 29 - year - old constable recalled how he was forced to use his iphone to navigate their way to trouble in @entity117 as they travelled across the capital to the disorder			1
a 25 - year - old special constable on his first shift was left all on his own in @entity88 , east @entity25 , being taunted by looters on monday august 7 outside a branch of @entity164			1
fearing for his life at the hands of the mob , he managed to defuse the situation by putting his arm round one of the rioters and posing for a photograph			0
as riots spread across cities last summer , police were left drowning in a blizzard of often bogus intelligence			1
rioters discussed tactics on @entity180 - but officers were unable to access the messages			2
in exasperation they were forced to turn to @entity184 in an attempt to stay one step ahead of the trouble - makers			2
but the @entity190 the @entity189 study revealed that officers ended up wasting their time checking out non-existent incidents			2
a bronze commander from @entity41 said they would receive a report of 50 masked men ' on @entity198 ' - only to find out that they were n't there			0
officers found that senior officers were out of touch with where trouble was brewing - and some of the best information came from people on the ground			2
senior metropolitan police officers also accepted they struggled to deploy enough staff to contain the violence during the four days of disorder in the capital			1
they failed to activate a national alarm system to call for more resources until the third day of riots - and once officers from other forces did arrive they were hampered by poor communication with central command			1
there were just 3,380 officers on duty in the capital when disorder first broke out in @entity25 following the shooting of @entity225 by police officers on august 7			1
by the third night this had risen only to 6,000 - before a massive show of strength brought the chaos to an end when 16,000 officers were sent out on august 10			0
the @entity233 had initially relied on local contacts to bring officers into @entity25 - and it was only on the third day that they used the @entity236 to obtain back - up			1
even once outside help was summoned , officers from provincial forces were left dealing with minor incidents as the capital burned			0
a 30 - year - old @entity243 constable told the researchers he could not be deployed in @entity88 or @entity24 where some of the worst disorder was seen because they could not access the @entity233 radio channel			1
another constable , 37 , from the same force told the @entity149 : ' it was just frustrating that we blue - lighted all the way down from @entity251 to there , and never really got used for anything apart from sitting in car parks and going to deal with shoplifters in @entity255 or @entity256 's			2
' destroyed : the 140 - year - old @entity22 in @entity24 lies in ruins after an arson attack during the disorder			0
it had survived the @entity260 and the @entity261 the @entity233 use their own radio channel rather than the standard @entity265 system that other police forces use			1
forces across @entity268 also failed to fully act on intelligence gleaned from social media networks , which were used by rioters to outmanoeuvre police , the interviews revealed			2
a @entity251 constable officers from @entity276 , @entity277 , @entity41 , @entity251 , @entity278 , @entity279 , @entity280 and the @entity233 , were interviewed as part of the study			1
@entity283 , chairman of the @entity284 , said police would struggle to cope with further disorder if the proposed austerity measures went ahead and urged the government to take ' urgent stock ' of the results of the study			1
he said : ' this comprehensive analysis demonstrates what we have been telling the government for two years now ; that a 20 per cent budget cut to policing will have a negative impact on public safety and that police numbers really do matter			0
' officers interviewed rightly identify and voice concern that , should the same circumstances occur again , the police service would struggle to cope and contain the situation with the loss of police officers numbers we are experiencing as a direct result of the cuts - over 5,000 last year alone			1

officers called into @entity25 were forced to deal with petty shoplifters while serious trouble broke out around them
