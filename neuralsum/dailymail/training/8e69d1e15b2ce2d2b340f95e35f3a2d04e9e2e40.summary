house speaker @entity0 accused @entity1 in the @entity2 on thursday of using funding for the @entity4 as ' blackmail ' as they attempt to protect president @entity8 's immigration measures			1
@entity0 's comments came after @entity11 @entity10 said at a press conference that @entity14 @entity13 would be guaranteeing a shut down of the department when saturday rolls around if they continue down the path that they 're on			1
' if they send over a bill with all the riders in it , they ’ve shut down the government			1
we ’re not going to play games , ' @entity10 said during a joint press conference this morning with his counterpart in the lower chamber , @entity27			1
the @entity14 , however , seemed confident that the situation would resolve itself in a timely manner , and the president 's spokesman told reporters on thursday that @entity8 had no immediate plans to get involved in the fight , which he characterized as ' a party dispute , ' not a partisan one			2
@entity1 ended their filibuster on wednesday of legislation to fund @entity4 after @entity13 leaders agreed to hold a separate vote on @entity8 's immigration directives			1
members are expected to pass a bill before they go home for the week that would keep the @entity4 up and running through the end of the fiscal year			1
they will take a separate vote to block the president 's programs at a later date			0
@entity0 would not say on thursday whether he would bring the ' clean ' bill that is free of language restricting the department from using its funds to implement @entity8 's directives to the floor of the @entity14 once it passes in the @entity2			1
' we ’re waiting to see what the @entity2 can or ca n’t do , and then we ’ll make decisions about how we ’re going to proceed , ' he said at a briefing			0
' i just think it ’s outrageous that @entity2 @entity1 are using @entity4 funding for blackmail to protect the actions of the president , where the president himself said he did n’t have the authority to do this , ' @entity0 said			1
the @entity13 leader rejected the @entity14 's repeated claims that the @entity4 dispute is a fight ‘ amongst @entity13			2
’ ' it is not a fight amongst @entity13			0
all republicans agree that we want to fund the @entity4 , and we want to stop the president ’s executive actions with regard to immigration , ' he contended			0
he then stuck out at the president for sitting ' there like a bump on a log watching @entity1 filibuster the debate on this bill			0
' ' if they send over a bill with all the riders in it , they ’ve shut down the government			1
we ’re not going to play games , ' @entity10 said			2
the @entity114 @entity113 is sporting glasses this week as his right eye recovers from surgery @entity27 showed at the press conference on thursday with sunglasses to show her solidarity with her @entity2 counterpart , who has been unable to see out of his right eye since @entity123 when he injured himself while exercizing the @entity14 confirmed on thursday that the president has not inserted himself directly into the argument in @entity126 , even as time runs out to come to an agreement , because he is hopeful @entity0 to follow the ' responsible course ' of action			1
' i think that everybody expects ' once the @entity4 funding bill comes up for a vote , it will get bipartisan support in the @entity2 and in the @entity14 , @entity8 's spokesman , @entity137 , said			1
the real question , he said , is whether @entity0 will allow that to happen			0
' if its necessary for the president to speak to him directly about how important it is to fund the @entity4 , he 'll have that conversation , ' @entity137 said , but ' i would anticipate that the speaker of the house understands the stakes ... of this action			0
' the @entity150 's cool tone toward the situation appeared to be an about - face from earlier in the week when the administration was on the verge of making doomsday warnings about the consequences of withholding money from the department responsible for protecting @entity159 from terrorists			0
@entity4 chief @entity161 held two news conference urging lawmakers to come to their senses and made the rounds on @entity37 in person on thursday to confront them directly			0
@entity8 claimed monday that withholding the funds would have ' direct impact ' on national security			0
wednesday , at a town hall on immigration hosted by @entity173 and @entity174 , the president said @entity13 were ' trying to hold hostage ' @entity4 's money ' which is so important for our national security			2
' more nonchalant about the matter than his boss had been the night before , @entity137 still maintained on thursday that a shutdown would ' would have negative consequences for the country ' and that furloughing thousands of @entity4 workers ' ca n't be good for our homeland security			0
' according to one estimate , 30,000 of the department 's employees would be kept off the job on the funding battle concluded			0
that would leave as many as 200,000 workers on the clock , but they would not be paid until @entity126 agreed on terms to fund @entity4 .			2

@entity197 ended their filibuster of legislation to fund @entity4 after @entity13 leaders agreed to hold a separate vote on @entity8 's immigration directives
the upper chamber is expected to pass a bill before members go home for the week that would keep the @entity4 up and running
@entity0 would n't make the same *commitment* on thursday
warning him , @entity10 said , ' if they send over a bill with all the riders in it , they ’ve shut down the government . we ’re not going to play games '
to which @entity0 *replied* : ' i just think it ’s outrageous that @entity2 @entity1 are using @entity4 funding for blackmail '
the @entity14 seemed confident on thursday that the standoff would end with @entity0 following the ' responsible course ' of action
