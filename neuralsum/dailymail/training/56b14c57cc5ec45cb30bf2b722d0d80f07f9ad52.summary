@entity0 regrets the way things ended at @entity3 , ditched following a serious breach of discipline aged just 17			1
he missed the victorious conclusion to their @entity8 campaign and left behind his closest friends , some of whom were later involved in the infamous smoke grenade incident which forced an evacuation of the training ground			2
his misdemeanour was deemed so serious that a confidentiality agreement stops him or @entity3 from revealing what it was			1
the teenager fell out of love with the game and could not even bear to watch football on television			1
@entity0 ( left ) says he has rediscovered his love for football since moving to @entity26 but @entity0 has come a long way in five years			1
on saturday he returns to @entity28 as @entity26 ’s biggest hope of upsetting the @entity31 leaders			1
indeed , the @entity32 would not be here if it was n’t for his three goals in the third round against @entity36			2
the 22 - year - old has matured since the days of being depicted as a teen tearaway			1
@entity0 is returning to @entity39 as a man			1
‘ i do regret it			0
it was me in the wrong and i messed stuff up , ’ he told @entity41			0
‘ i could have learnt a whole lot more			0
i was young and naive			0
i always had belief in myself as a player , but you need more than that			0
‘ looking back , i would take so much more on board , because these players are the best in the world and i was training with them			0
‘ the likes of @entity53 , @entity54 and @entity55 , they get it right every single day			0
they enjoy it every day as well			0
that ’s the big thing — these guys have been at the top for so long yet love coming in to train			2
that ’s the key thing , you ’ve got to love what you do to be the best			2
’ @entity0 scored a hat - trick as the @entity32 beat @entity36 in their @entity66 third round replay @entity0 signed for @entity67 following his release from @entity3 — where he had captained the junior side and won @entity71 youth honours — but he was already on a second chance despite his tender years			1
he did well on @entity74 and was rated by the management			0
still , though , he failed to make a breakthrough and was sent on loan			0
but @entity78 arrived in 2013 and took an instant liking to @entity0 — perhaps it was a shared penchant for spectacular goals — and gave him a top - flight debut at @entity83			1
‘ people say he was crazy , and he was in a way , but i just think it was more passion , ’ said the @entity86 - born attacking midfielder , who has seven goals this season			0
‘ i think he liked me and he had me in training with the first team and gave me my debut			0
he would join in the training all the time and be very vocal and hands - on			0
‘ i loved that time and , on the whole , i enjoyed my time at @entity67 but i knew i was n’t going to get a chance there			1
@entity0 has played 30 times since moving to @entity26 , scoring seven goals in the process ‘ at a young age you do n’t want to be sitting on the bench or playing in the reserves and i needed something new			1
’ that something was @entity108 and @entity26			1
@entity0 signed a two - year deal in the summer and endeared himself to supporters with a 25 - yard rocket as @entity26 enjoyed their first victory in 28 years over @entity113 rivals @entity114 in august			1
‘ i ’m back in love with the game now , ’ he said			2
‘ it was hard not to make it at @entity3 but i ’m learning the other side of the game now in @entity121			1
my aim is still to play in the @entity31 but i think i had to drop down to progress			0
’ @entity0 scored twice in the 3 - 3 draw at @entity36 and was on target again in a 4 - 0 thrashing in the replay			1
‘ we still had the replay to come but i was watching the fourth - round draw with my fiancée at home and i must admit i cheered when we got @entity3 , ’ he said			1
@entity0 scores in the 3 - 3 draw against @entity36 in the @entity66 , @entity26 won the replay ‘ it was funny though , we went to @entity136 and lost 1 - 0 last week			1
we then got on the coach and saw that @entity3 had won 5 - 0 at @entity138 ! that was a bit scary			1
‘ even with their second xi out they ’ll still all be internationals and world - class players			0
’ @entity0 ’s dad , @entity144 , has organised a bus for 40 friends and family — including @entity0 ’s mum , @entity149 , and younger brother , @entity151 — to make the trip from @entity86 to the capital			2
also in the crowd will be grandad @entity155 and grandma @entity156 who have travelled from @entity157			0
‘ my grandad has cancer so it ’s special for him to be coming over , it means a lot to me , ’ said @entity0			2
‘ there ’ll also be a rowdy crowd from @entity86 who ’ll be cheering us on			0
and i really think we can get a draw and take them back to our place			0
‘ it ’ll be tough , but this is the @entity66			2
why not ? we ’ve just got to give it everything we ’ve got and do ourselves proud			0
’ this time , @entity0 wants to leave @entity28 with no regrets .			2
