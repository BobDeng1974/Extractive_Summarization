much like @entity6 ’s trains , @entity1 ’s title campaign ground to a temporary halt in the north @entity4 area			2
a win here , and they could have dared to dream going into the second half of the season			2
and while a goalless draw at @entity13 was far from a catastrophe , the performance was certainly less than is required of champions			2
@entity16 are due here on january 1			2
we shall see what @entity19 makes of a @entity22 team that remains very much a work in progress under @entity25			2
videos scroll down to watch @entity27 looks on from the floor as his header is palmed over the line by @entity31 , but the goal was disallowed for offside @entity31 makes himself big to deny @entity33 as @entity1 spurned several great chances in a goalless first half @entity36 tries to get away from @entity1 defender @entity37 as both sides looked to protect their recent unbeaten records @entity22 : @entity31 8 , chiriches 6 , @entity40 6 , @entity41 6 , @entity42 6 , @entity43 5.5 , @entity44 5.5 , @entity45 6 ( @entity46 79 mins ) , @entity47 5.5 , @entity48 5 ( @entity49 79 ) , @entity36 6			1

click here to see more from our brilliant @entity83 to be fair , neither team should be particularly happy with this			1
@entity1 had the best of the first half but were undone by a combination of their own inefficiency in front of goal and the brilliance of goalkeeper @entity31			1
the second half belonged to @entity22 but they did not carve out enough chances of import and while @entity96 was again impressive , it did not require heroics to keep the home team at bay			2
the draw was the proper result , but those who expected a high - scoring affair given the ambition of these clubs and the array of talent on display left disappointed			0
@entity36 worked hard but to scant effect , while @entity1 ’s expensive acquisitions could find no way through			0
@entity74 picked the same @entity1 side that beat @entity113 on @entity114 — the first consistent starting @entity115 since november 2012 , a run of 85 league games — and will no doubt believe he had no option given one day to prepare between fixtures			0
yet @entity1 looked leggy by the end , with @entity22 in the ascendancy			0
they could have lost it with eight minutes remaining when @entity36 put through @entity44 with only @entity57 to beat			0
he snatched at his shot and blasted over			0
there was an inevitability about the slow fade to the end from there			0
@entity61 , whose return to the @entity1 team has coincided with their recent good form , looks to play a pass @entity36 throws himself at a chipped pass from @entity45 but the @entity22 striker could n't quite get enough on the shot @entity44 chops down @entity1 striker @entity33 , giving away a free kick in a dangerous area @entity64 sees his free kick deflected off the @entity22 wall and onto @entity31 ' post , resulting in a goalmouth scramble neither @entity67 or @entity146 were able to turn the ball over the line as it came back off the post , @entity42 and @entity31 scrambled it away it has been hard to overshadow @entity57 this season , but @entity22 goalkeeper @entity31 pulled it off			1
if there was one exceptional display here , it was his first 45 minutes , which shaded @entity1 ’s standout performers , @entity66 and @entity64			1
faced with a stellar front line and a supporting cast that is finally beginning to click , only @entity31 prevented @entity1 having the game won by half - time			1
he flew through the air acrobatically and stuck in a tackle on @entity33 that would have pleased @entity169			1
yet , from a long way out , this was a game that was going to be settled by one goal — or left wanting for goals at all			1
as @entity22 are currently playing the inexperienced @entity36 as a lone front man , they will have less to regret			0
after the money spent on @entity1 ’s forwards this season , nobody should leave a tense affair like this talking about @entity22 ’s goalkeeper			0
@entity184 would surely have expected to find a match - winner in his ranks , even accounting for seasonal fatigue			0
the promise is certainly there			0
@entity64 is growing into his role this season and twice he picked out @entity67 in the first half , @entity31 dealing with both shots comfortably			1
more fortunate was a 23rd - minute escape after @entity64 ’s free - kick from 25 yards out clipped the top of the @entity22 wall and deflected on to @entity31 ’s near post			1
it rebounded , leaving the goalkeeper stranded and provoking a mad scramble , ended only when @entity202 cleared under pressure from @entity146			0
@entity65 , continuing in his new midfield role , challenges in the air with @entity43 as @entity1 looked to take control @entity1 manager @entity74 named an unchanged team for the first time , despite having two games in three days these were testing times for @entity22 and a minute later , pandemonium again			0
this time it was @entity146 ’s header that provoked the confusion , @entity67 and @entity27 competing to force the ball over the line , before @entity218 cleared it with an acrobatic overhead kick			1
the replays showed the ball was in before @entity222 made contact , but also that @entity27 was offside , and the free - kick to @entity22 was the correct decision			1
@entity1 ’s @entity57 has proven expert at saving with his feet this season , but @entity31 showed he was a match for that skill , too			1
@entity61 played a lovely through - ball over the top to @entity146 , putting him clear with only @entity31 to beat			2
for a moment a breakthrough seemed certain , but @entity146 required too many touches and @entity31 as good as tackled him , centre - half style , in the six - yard box			1
rounding off an outstanding first half , @entity31 tipped out a cross by @entity66 that swung in viciously , becoming a tasty shot			1
there were odd threats after half - time — most particularly two wild shots over the bar from @entity146 and @entity64 — but it was @entity22 ’s game from there			2
unlike @entity1 , however , they rarely got in behind the back line and most of their opportunities came from range			0
@entity45 , @entity40 and @entity47 all had a go , but it would have been a poor show from @entity57 if any of the attempts had gone in , and his form is too good right now to be beaten from distance			0
managers like solid performances like this , particularly over the gruelling festive period , but anyone who has seen @entity16 or striker-less @entity259 of late will know the difference			0
it is more than mere tiredness			0
@entity67 had several excellent chances in the first half , but the @entity265 could not find a way past @entity31 in the @entity22 goal @entity67 holds his face after a coming together with @entity218 on what was a frustrating day for the @entity265 striker @entity96 charges out of his goal to deny @entity22 midfielder @entity44 , but the @entity1 keeper was rarely troubled in the first half the @entity273 captain @entity31 stood up well to deny @entity146 , who should really have scored with the best chance of the first 45 minutes @entity31 pulls off another stunning one - handed save to deny @entity66 , whose shot was curling dangerously towards the far corner @entity277 takes on @entity22 left back @entity42 as @entity1 looked brighter , but struggled to find the breakthrough at @entity13 @entity64 , the creative spark in @entity1 's midfield at @entity13 , skips past @entity22 's @entity281 @entity67 runs away from @entity47 as united continued to create all the best chances , but failed to take them a frustrated @entity184 makes a point to fourth official @entity285 as his side produced the better football without much to show for it @entity65 controls the ball as he breaks away from @entity202 but @entity1 could n't find a winning goal @entity66 , who had already been shown a yellow card , was fortunate to escape a second when @entity292 ruled he had n't fouled @entity45			1

@entity27 has a goal correctly disallowed for offside during goalless first half
@entity31 at his brilliant best to deny @entity33 , @entity67 and @entity66
