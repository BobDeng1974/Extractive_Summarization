by @entity1 reporter published : 17:43 est , 25 july 2013 updated : 08:39 est , 26 july 2013 for generations it has been the family friendly board game used to while away a rainy afternoon			0
but it seems the latest generation of @entity7 players are simply too busy for the full version of the game			2
instead its makers , @entity10 , have launched a new kids version of the classic which can be completed in less than half an hour so it can fit into its young players ’ busy schedules			1
@entity15 is on the list of top toy predictions for youngsters with an action packed schedule and short attention span manufacturers say the new @entity15 game , which is aimed at children of eight and older , is meeting demand in the market from youngsters who simply do n’t have the attention span to play for hours			1
either that or they cant fit it in among their frantic schedules of ballet classes and football practice			0
in @entity34 , makers of the @entity34 version of the game have become so concerned by busy pre-teens that they have even eliminated the jail , so children do n’t waste time waiting to roll a double			1
and @entity10 are n’t the only ones making their games quicker to play			2
as a whole the toy industry have made a move to offer what they call ‘ snack toys ’ to appeal to children who have very little play time because of their action packed days			1
toy manufacturers have been updating other games such as @entity53 and @entity54 with new speedier versions to keep the attention of their increasingly distracted young customers			2
how it used to be : mother and son spending quality time together playing @entity7 - back then children were encouraged to build a property empire on the classic board or even ' go to jail ' thanks to its new incarnation as @entity68 , it is now possible to complete a round of the classic word game in just two and a half minutes			2
@entity71 , of @entity72 , pictured at her home in @entity74			0
she says : ' the frantic pace of modern life makes it very hard to get the whole family together to play a board game ' @entity72 founder @entity71 said the development of these shorter games showed how traditional board games had become a casualty of modern society but added that even playing a short game was better than watching endless hours of tv			1
she said : ‘ the frantic pace of modern life makes it very hard to get the whole family together to play a board game			2
‘ with many families having both dad and mum out at work all day , evenings are more likely to be spent doing homework or household chores than leisurely playing board games			1
‘ so at first glance this seems a sad indictment of the breakneck speed we live our lives			0
however , as society is n’t going to change anytime soon , perhaps it is simple @entity7 being pragmatic			0
‘ if a short version encourages young kids to get into the game instead of watching tv or playing on the computer , then it would be welcomed by many parents			0
’ and it appears it is not just the children that have increasingly hectic schedules to keep up with			0
last year a joined survey with @entity72 and toy manufacturers @entity117 questioned more than 1,200 parents and found that more than a quarter are now so busy they only play board games with their families twice a year			1
but it ’s not just the length of play that has changed with the new edition of @entity7 , in a surrender to 21st century commercialism children are now encouraged to buy and sell brands rather than properties as they move around the board			0
@entity10 , the world ’s largest board game maker , has sought the involvement of leading global brands such as @entity133 , @entity134 and @entity135 which occupy the spaces on the board ones marked out by the streets of @entity139			0
instead of building houses and hotels children collect tiles relating to each brand and use them to build up their own skyscraper in the centre of the board			0
the winner is the first to complete their skyscraper			0
computer games , toys , ballet and sport are keeping children too busy to sit down with their families - the classic @entity7 board game is being updated to compete for the attention of pre-teens but mrs @entity71 maintains that if these shorter games give children a taste for the joy of a good board game , it still may mean a resurrection of the full version as they get older			1
she added : ‘ lots of eight year olds also do n’t have the concentration for the full version and mastering the short game will undoubtedly improve their skills and teach them patience			1
‘ and if they enjoy the short version , it will encourage them to try the longer version , preserving an interest in board games for the next generation			1

youngsters simply do n’t have the attention span to play for hours
makers of the @entity34 version have even eliminated the jail
toy industry are offering ‘ snack toys ’ to appeal to busy children
more than a quarter only play board games with their families twice a year
