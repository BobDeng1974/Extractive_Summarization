on or off duty ? justice sir @entity1 admitted to making a life - or - death decision over the phone while at the zoo judges are making life - or - death decisions about vulnerable people based on casual phone consultations with council lawyers , it was revealed last night			1
the secretive @entity11 has an out - of - hours service which is being routinely used by local authorities wishing to ‘ rush through ’ decisions			1
in many cases , judgments are handed out over the phone with the family not being consulted and proper evidence not being made available			1
one judge – who was on a trip to a zoo – has even admitted to giving a decision on his mobile phone about whether a @entity25 with learning difficulties should get life - saving treatment			1
in another case , a judge allowed an @entity31 woman with learning difficulties to be forcibly removed from her home on the grounds of ‘ flimsy ’ evidence that she was going to be forced into marriage			2
after a few weeks in care , the woman was returned home but the family sued and were paid thousands of pounds in compensation by the local council			2
out - of - hours rulings , a system meant to be used only in urgent cases , are being routinely abused , an investigation has revealed			1
instead of being subject to open court , judges on call between 4pm and 9am are consulted over the phone by a single barrister often without the involvement of families			1
written evidence is rarely used out - of - hours and the proceedings are not always recorded			1
one legal expert told the independent newspaper : ‘ there is no real investigation out - of - hours over whether [ an action ] would be appropriate			2
it ’s just the local authority ringing the judge up , the parents are not part of the proceedings , so it ’s on full trust that the barrister gives their side			0
‘ we can see from the transcripts that judges do n’t ask enough questions and the barristers do n’t tell them the other side of the story			2
’ in the dark : @entity77 was jailed ' in secret ' for trying to remove their father @entity79 from a care home the @entity82 has led calls for the reform of the @entity11 which is shielded from the scrutiny of the public and the press			0
@entity89 , chairman of the @entity90 on @entity91 and the @entity11 , will today call for an inquiry into the out - of - hours service by the @entity94			2
he described the system as an ‘ appalling ’ one in which ‘ the family are not told about it , but the judge is called to rubber - stamp a decision			1
’ he said : ‘ i was shocked when i found out this was going on			0
‘ the court is there to protect people , but it seems more concerned about protecting local authorities and their incomes			0
i ’ve been to see ministers several times and they ’re just not interested in looking at individual cases			0
‘ they turn a blind eye to the problem – it ’s a disgrace			0
’ a retired high court judge has also attacked the system which does not publish the results of its hearings , making appeals nearly impossible			0
sir @entity1 said : ‘ there are very few cases which ca n’t wait until monday morning			1
for example , any cases involving turning off of machines can wait			0
’ in another case he said he was asked to make a decision while on a family outing to @entity126			1
he said : ‘ the transplant case was made in the back of a car outside @entity126 , my wife said it was the only time she ’d heard me making judgments			0
’ sir @entity1 claims the procedure causes a problem for transparency because rulings are often not recorded so transcripts are not available			1
he added : ‘ there ’s a duty to keep a note [ of hearings ] i ’ve kept them but i ’ve never been asked for them			0
’ last month the @entity82 highlighted the case of @entity77 , 50 , who was secretly jailed for five months for attempting to move her 80 - year - old father from a care home where she believed he was at risk			2
secrecy rules forbade anyone to name @entity152 , her father , the @entity154 councillor who asked for her to be locked up or the social worker who gave evidence against her			0
she served six weeks before finally being released .			0
