by @entity0 published : 20:54 est , 12 march 2013 updated : 12:13 est , 13 march 2013 a breed of parrot has been shown to be as clever as a child of four when it comes to making long term decisions proving their species do n't , as is often assumed , just learn parrot - fashion			1
scientists found the captive bred @entity11 's cockatoo is able to resist the temptation of eating an immediate food item in order to trade it for a better reward down the line			1
this mirrored a famous experiment in the @entity19 40 years ago when nursery school children were put in a room and given a marshmallow , biscuit or pretzel stick			1
they could either eat it right away or wait 15 minutes and get an extra treat			2
the captive bred @entity11 's cockatoo can resist the temptation of eating an immediate food item in order to trade it for a better reward in the future tracking them over time those with the ability to wait got better grades , were healthier , enjoyed greater professional success and proved better at staying in relationships - even decades after they took the test			1
they were , in short , better at life			0
the ability to anticpate a delayed gain is considered mentally challenging since it requires not just the capacity to control a direct impulse but also to assess the gain 's beneficial value against the cost of having to wait and the reliability of the trader			1
psychologists say such aptitude could be considered signs of economic decision making and are rarely found outside humans			0
just a few , typically large brained animals , have been found able to refuse an immediate snack for a bigger one for more than a minute			0
but the @entity60 cockatoo , which hit the headlines last year by spontaneously making and using ' tools ' to reach food , has now managed it , reports the @entity66 journal @entity67			1
@entity68 , of the @entity69 , said : ' the animals were allowed to pick up an initial food item and given the opportunity to return it directly into the experimenter 's hand after an increasing time delay			1
the @entity69 study mirrored a famous experiment in the @entity19 forty years ago when nursery school childrens were put in a room and given a marshmallow , biscuit or pretzel stick pieces of eight : psychologists say such aptitude could be considered signs of economic decision making and are rarely found outside humans ' if the initial food item had not been nibbled by this time , the bird received another reward of an even higher preferred food type or of a larger quantity than the initial food in exchange			1
' although we picked pecan nuts as the initial reward which were highly liked by the birds and would under normal circumstances be consumed straightaway , we found all 14 of the birds waited for food of higher quality , such as a cashew nut , for up to 80 seconds			0
' study co-author dr @entity102 said the @entity103 acted ' astonishingly like economic agents ' , trading off between immediate and future benefits			2
she said : ' while human infants or primates can hold the initial food in their hands , one should also consider the birds were able to wait although they had to hold the food in their beaks , directly against their taste organs while waiting			2
' imagine placing a cookie directly into a toddler 's mouth and telling him or her they will only receive a piece of chocolate if the cookie is not nibbled for over a minute			2
' another of the researchers professor @entity124 has carried out similar studies on ravens and crows			0
he added : ' until recently , birds were considered to lack any self control			0
when we found corvids could wait for delayed food , we speculated which socioecological onditions could favour the evolution of such skills			0
' to test our ideas we needed clever birds that are distantly related to corvids			0
parrots were the obvious choice and the results on @entity143 show we are on the right track			0

captive bred @entity11 's cockatoo able to resist temptation of eating
*discovery* shows they can think of long term benefits of waiting
it mirrors a famous experiment on children in the @entity19 40 years ago
