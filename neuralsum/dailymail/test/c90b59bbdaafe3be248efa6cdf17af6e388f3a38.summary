conservative plans to raise billions of pounds from the ' grubby hands of scroungers ' will not work , @entity0 warned today as he unveiled @entity4 plans to balance the books			1
the @entity4 leader promised to ' spread the burden ' of deficit reduction , with cuts to welfare and @entity12 budgets along with tax rises aimed at the very wealthy			1
car tax would rise by £ 25 - a - year			1
but he scaled back his plans for a mansion tax , amid concern it could cost the party support in key seats in affluent parts of @entity23			1
but he mocked @entity36 's insistence that another £ 12billion can be found from the welfare budget			1
mr @entity0 warned that it was ' quite simply impossible ' to find savings on that scale without causing ' real pain to millions of families ' and some of the most vulnerable people			1
the @entity4 set out plans to cap rises in working age benefits at 1 per cent to two years			1
they would also make changes to the universal credit benefits system and take winter fuel payments and free tv licences away from wealthy pensioners – something the @entity54 have rejected			0
at a press conference in central @entity23 , mr @entity0 said : ' we are going to spread the burden of finishing the job of fixing the economy fairly across society			0
' yes that means more cuts , but it also means asking the wealthiest to pay their fare share too			0
' he added : ' our plan means finding more than £ 3billion in savings from the welfare budget			1
savings which ask wealthy pensioners to make a small sacrifice			0
' savings which involve fair adjustments to universal credit			0
continued restraint on the rate of increase of benefits and a ground - breaking plan to reduce benefit fraud and error and get the most vulnerable off benefits and into work			2
' at a press conference with @entity4 minister @entity85 , mr @entity0 warned that it was ' quite simply impossible ' to find £ 12billion savings from welfare without causing ' real pain to millions of families ' and some of the most vulnerable people among the @entity4 deficit - reduction plans confirmed by the party 's leader are : he warned that the @entity54 ' plan to veer away sharply from the sensible and balanced course we have set together in government '			1
he continued : ' if you listen to @entity36 you could be forgiven for believing that they intend to find all £ 12 billion from the grubby hands of scroungers and layabouts			2
' finding anything remotely close to that scale of savings is quite simply impossible without causing real pain to millions of families and some of the most vulnerable people in our society			1
' with pensions rightly protected , there is simply no benefit out there large enough where you can find £ 12 billion of savings without hurting children or disabled people			0
' he added : ' the @entity125 ' welfare plans are a dangerous deceit that will end up hurting the most vulnerable people in our society and millions of the poorest working families			0
' it emerged that the @entity4 have scaled down the amount of money they expect their mansion tax proposal to generate by £ 700million			1
properties valued at £ 2 million or more would be subject to the party 's so - called ' high value property levy ' from 2017 - 18 , which they say would collect £ 1 billion - down from the £ 1.7 billion previously estimated			1
mr @entity0 said adopting a ' reasonable and fair ' approach to the policy had resulted in the estimated revenue decreasing			0
the @entity4 leader added the charges proposed ' should n't scare the horses ' and used the same principle as council tax bands in order to prevent oligarchs who live in mansions paying the same property tax as a family			1
the charge would be £ 2,000 per year or less for properties valued at £ 2 million to £ 2.5 million , £ 3,500 or less if valued at £ 2.5 million to £ 3 million , £ 5,000 per year or less if valued at £ 3 million to £ 4 million , and £ 9,000 per year or less if valued between £ 4 million and £ 5 million			2
mr @entity0 said : ' it 's not fair a family home in @entity154 pays the same property tax as an oligarch in a vast mansion			2
' what we 're saying is we 'll extend the same fair banded approach up the value chain			0
' mr @entity0 challenged the other parties to spell out in similar detail how they would balance the nation 's books car tax will increase on average by £ 25 a year by 2017 - 18 , with drivers of gas guzzlers facing even higher bills under @entity4 plans			1
@entity0 's party plans a review of vehicle excise duty ( @entity176 ) rates to ensure that the @entity177 continues to receive the money it expects as motorists switch to cleaner , lower - tax models			1
figures released by the party in a pre-manifesto briefing show an extra £ 485 million will be raised by the rebanding in 2016 - 17 and £ 850 million in 2017 - 18			1
at a central @entity23 press conference , mr @entity0 rejected the assertion that the tax hike amounted to a new ' war on motorists ' , insisting the measure was to maintain the ' status quo ' on the revenue raised			0
he said : ' it 's a revenue retention measure - we simply want to maintain the same amount of money from the overall vehicle duty system as we set out in 2010			2
' this is just to make sure as the system shifts around because people are buying lower emission vehicles , we still generate the same revenue			0
' mr @entity0 challenged the other parties to spell out in similar detail how they would balance the nation 's books			0
he said the @entity4 are the only party offering a ' balanced ' programme to pay down the remaining deficit and deliver a £ 7.7 billion surplus , while still finding money to raise income tax thresholds to £ 11,000 and invest in the @entity211			1
setting out plans to eradicate the current structural deficit by 2017 - 18 , mr @entity0 said his party was giving an ' unprecedented level of detail ' about its financial plans and challenged @entity217 and the @entity54 to do the same			1
mr @entity0 said @entity217 's plans involved £ 70 billion more borrowing , claiming ' they are playing @entity221 roulette with your family 's future '			2
labour leader @entity225 leads a party that ' want you to think they can be trusted to balance the books without saying how they intend to do it ' , he said			2
' they wo n't even tell you when they want to do it by , ' he added			0
warning that @entity217 's plans would involve extra borrowing , he said it would mean an extra £ 4 billion - £ 134 for every taxpayer - on debt interest payments			2
' it means you , your children , your friends and your neighbours will be left paying for @entity217 's borrowing for years to come			0
' they are playing @entity221 roulette with your family 's future			0
' explaining the @entity4 alternative he said there was ' @entity248 '			2
' i ca n't promise you that the next two years will be easy			0
your hard work and sacrifice has turned our economy around , but there is still a job to finish			0
