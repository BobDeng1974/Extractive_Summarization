by @entity0 for @entity2 , it does not matter if his team summon a thrilling response in @entity5 in the @entity6 or finish the @entity8 campaign with a flourish			1
his mind is made up			0
some of this @entity12 squad do not have the ‘ personality ’ required to perform at @entity17 , @entity18 or @entity19 , according to a manager who promised to perform ‘ surgery ’ in the transfer market			1
after his strikers failed to score in the defeat at @entity19 on saturday , @entity2 warned them that a new centre forward would arrive in the summer — @entity24 ’s @entity23 is thought to be the top target — and those not ready to compete can go			1
surgery : @entity2 has promised to make changes after blasting players without personality incoming ? @entity24 striker @entity23 is widely believed to be @entity2 's top target stay or go ! @entity12 's existing strikers , including @entity32 ( c ) have been told they can compete or leave firing blanks : the future of strikers @entity36 ( left ) and @entity37 ( right ) also lays in the balance ‘ it is clear to everybody that @entity12 next year want to bring a striker , ’ said @entity2			1
‘ what ’s the future for the others ? the ones who are staying are competing with the striker we are bringing in			2
‘ it is normal at the end of the season if players who are not playing a lot or players who are not happy and prefer a change will go			1
that is also part of the market			0
‘ we want to improve the team and the players and make some surgical movements in the transfer window			2
it is also clear we want to improve our players			2
‘ i ca n’t and i do n’t need to improve @entity64 , @entity65 or @entity66 , but there are others i need to improve			0
we are doing that step by step			0
but that ’s not enough to be champions			0
’ dream is over ? @entity66 's own goal against @entity19 condemned @entity12 to their fifth league defeat telling off ! @entity2 was involved in an altercation with a ballboy over alleged time wasting this was @entity19 ’s first @entity8 win over @entity12			1
their last league victory over their @entity83 rivals was in august 1990 in the old @entity84			0
the @entity12 manager warned it would make no difference if his team win in @entity89 against @entity90 in the first leg of the @entity6 quarter - final on wednesday			1
‘ @entity5 is the kind of match they feel comfortable to play , ’ said @entity2			1
‘ it is a big match in a great stadium against opponents of top quality and a referee who stops the game and does n’t let aggression into the game			2
i prefer the @entity105 ones but normally this is the profile of referee in @entity109 competitions			0
‘ i do not need to do a lot			0
they will be in their natural habitat in that match			0
they can do a good match there			0
’ big game : @entity12 will not need motivating for their @entity6 tie against @entity120 's @entity90 giant killers : it is against some of the lesser teams , including @entity17 that @entity12 have struggled this season as for the final six games of the season , he added : ‘ the easiest thing to do is to perform when you are not playing for something big			1
if , in the last part of the season , we have an unbelievable performance and some player is going to perform in a beautiful way , that ’s easy			1
‘ the difficult thing is to perform when you feel the heat			2
because of that some are big and some are not so big			0
’ it will merely prove the manager ’s point if his team react in @entity5			0
he has written off the @entity8 title and believes @entity12 must add the fighting spirit they generated when he won the title in 2005 and 2006			1
not in the bag ! @entity12 have also twice dropped points to the likes of @entity18 this season warriors : @entity12 's title winning sides of 2005 and 2006 arguably had more fighting spirit after saturday ’s defeat at @entity19 , @entity65 and @entity159 slumped on to the turf , dejected			1
@entity66 looked distraught after heading in the own goal which settled the game			0
‘ it feels like the end , that it is over , ’ said @entity65			0
‘ it is massively disappointing and at the end of the game , it was a horrible feeling			0
’ @entity2 marched on to the pitch , making a beeline for @entity65 and hauled him up , put an arm around him and told him to leave with his head held high			1
‘ i told him he was one of the guys who should not be on the floor , ’ said @entity2			2
‘ i told him he was one of the guys who should walk to the dressing room with pride , that he had another performance where he gave absolutely everything			0
support act : @entity2 picks a dejected @entity65 off the floor after @entity12 's title hopes were dashed die hard fan : @entity2 insists he has no problem with players like @entity65 who give everything to win ‘ i do n’t think it ’s down to courage			1
it ’s down to the qualities that make personality profiles			2
you have some players for everything and other players who are in their habitat in some circumstances			2
‘ so , @entity200 is better than away			2
playing away against @entity201 , @entity17 , @entity202 or @entity203 is one thing and another thing is to play at @entity19 , @entity206 or @entity17			1
clearly , we have players who are up and down in relation to the profile of the match			0
’ this defeat was @entity12 ’s fifth in the @entity6 this season			1
all of them have come away from home against teams outside the top four and — but for the one at @entity17 in december — all without scoring a goal			1
man in the mask : @entity221 will return from domestic suspension to play against @entity90 in @entity109 despite @entity2 saying he has given up on the title , it remains tight at the top , unlike the last two seasons , when @entity12 trailed 14 points behind the champions last year and 25 points behind in 2012			1
the @entity12 boss said : ‘ to be where we are is an important step and , when you are there , you have in the back of your mind the little feeling that you can still do it , but the reality is different			1
’ @entity2 does not expect @entity37 ( hamstring ) to make the @entity5 match and @entity242 is out with a knee problem			1
@entity221 , banned against @entity19 , will return but @entity244 and @entity245 are ineligible			2
@entity2 warned his team to prepare for surgery in the summer after concluding that some simply do not have the personality to compete for the @entity8 title			1
who ’s for the chop ? @entity252 after 45 minutes in midfield on saturday			0
@entity2 prefers others and knows he can bank more than £ 30m for the @entity255			2
@entity256 and @entity257 are interested			0
@entity258 scored a @entity8 goal since january			0
@entity12 would accept offers close to £ 20m			2
@entity261 are interested , but do not value him so highly			0
@entity264 - high wages would be a problem too			0
@entity267 those @entity2 claims will probably want to leave if they are not in the team			1
@entity261 also interested in him			0
@entity269 third among @entity2 ’s three strikers this season			1
there wo n’t be a shortage of takers for a proven goalscorer			0
@entity276 injured and seems unlikely to be encouraged to stay			0
@entity2 has been using @entity159 at left back this season			1
@entity278 fits the profile of those @entity2 accuses of not turning up for humdrum fixtures ... but can @entity2 afford to let all his strikers go ? @entity282 to be told where he stands but @entity2 is not keen on his style			1
@entity286 head list of @entity8 clubs queueing up to sign him .			0
