military researchers have put dozens of soldiers , both women and men , through a series of drills wednesday aimed at helping the @entity6 develop a unisex test to decide which troops are fit for combat			1
@entity10 spent weeks training volunteers in performing tasks the @entity6 considers essential for troops on front lines - from dragging a wounded comrade to safety to loading 65 pound anti-tank missiles			1
scientists from the @entity6 's @entity19 had volunteer soldiers don oxygen masks and heart - rate monitors to record their exertion			0
the @entity53 plans to start opening up combat jobs to women as early as 2016			1
commanders want to break from longtime gauges of physical fitness that include push - ups , sit - ups and 2 - mile runs in order to devise a test that more accurately mimics the most strenuous tasks that infantrymen , tank crews and other combat troops perform			1
drills such as scaling a 6 - foot wall in 70 pounds of gear and removing the heavy barrel of a 25 mm gun on an armored vehicles are nothing new for male soldiers already in combat units			2
that said , they 're completely unfamiliar to @entity6 women so @entity10 gave its soldier - volunteers a month to train			2
' when we started , it was very challenging because we 'd never experienced any of these tasks before , ' said captain @entity79 , 40 , who after 21 years in the @entity6 is getting her first taste of what it takes to serve in a combat unit			0
' but , once you get to rehearse ... it becomes easy			0
' co-ed : drills such as scaling a 6 - foot wall in 70 pounds of gear and removing the heavy barrel of a 25 mm gun on an armored vehicles are nothing new for male soldiers but they are new to female soldiers on tuesday the troops - 89 men and 58 women - were timed during the run through at @entity10 in @entity98 in seeking fitness standards based on real - word job requirements , the @entity6 follows many @entity102 fire departments that in recent years made entrance tests fairer to women than old standards heavy on push - ups and other upper - body exercises that favor men			1
major general @entity109 , commander of @entity10 's @entity110 , said allowing women into combat units will do more than break one of the military 's last gender barriers			2
he noted a very small @entity6 ' population ' will qualify , adding ' this overall effort is really about matching skill sets and attributes to the right job			0
' whatever fitness test emerges for combat service should be a challenge for both men and women to show that standards are n't being lowered to accommodate female soldiers , said @entity127 , a retired @entity128 captain who studies how military policies affect women for the women 's @entity131			1
' the idea for the military is n't that any women coming through can pass their test , ' @entity127 said			0
' it 's that anybody male or female who can pass the test should be able to serve in that occupation			0
if it 's one woman out of a thousand , so be it			0

male and female soldiers in @entity10 , @entity98 have been tested on a new set of drills as women are considered for front - line positions
physical fitness tests have included push ups and 2 mile runs for years but now they will include other drills that are considered more essential
drills that test soldiers ' ability to carry 65 - pound anti-tank missiles and the ability to carry a wounded comrade are being added
@entity53 hopes to open combat positions to women by 2016
