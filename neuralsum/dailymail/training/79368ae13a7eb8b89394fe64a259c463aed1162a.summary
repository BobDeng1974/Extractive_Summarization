by @entity0 a young woman facing a lifetime of obesity - related diabetes was inspired to lose more than 16st after her beloved father succumbed to the disease			1
@entity7 , 26 , was devastated when her father @entity8 fell into a diabetic coma and died aged just 51 in may 2009			1
at the time of her father ’s death @entity14 , from @entity15 , weighed around 27st after years of comfort eating			1
@entity14 had a gastric band fitted and dropped from 27st 9lb and size 32 ( left ) to 12st and size 14 ( right ) she was warned that she too might develop diabetes unless she got her weight under control and , motivated by her late father ’s wish that she improved her health , secured funding for a gastric bypass , which saw her shrink down to 10st 4lb			1
she said : ' i was a daddy ’s girl			2
he always wanted the best for me and before he died he told me that he wanted me to improve my lifestyle and be happy			1
' everyone except me could see that my health was failing			2
for some reason , the message never clicked			2
but to see my father die from diabetes was frightening			1
' suddenly i knew i did n’t want that to happen to me , and i knew he would be proud of me if i managed to make the changes i needed to			0
' miss @entity7 , an office worker , first turned to large portions of starchy , stodgy food to comfort her when she was bullied at secondary school			1
she said : ' i ’m a natural redhead and being ginger made me stand out			0
children can be very cruel			0
i was the one which other children targeted			0
' the more i ate , the larger i became and soon the kids were calling me fat as well as ginger			0
' by the time i got to college the bullying had stopped but i was already trapped in the cycle of associating food with emotional comfort			1
' @entity59 , left aged 14 , began comfort eating in childhood after being bullied for being a redhead , and by the age she was 21 she weighed an unhealthy 21st ( right ) weighing around 16st by the time she started college , she tried various diet plans and was even prescribed weight - loss tablets , but her weight continued to increase until , by the time her father became ill in the spring of 2009 , she weight nearly 27st			1
the weight began to fall off following gastric band surgery , and @entity14 remains on a restricted diet after her father passed away , miss @entity7 made a lasting decision to turn her life around for good			1
she said : ' @entity74 was as thin as rake and had been like that since he was young			0
his diabetes was genetic , which meant i was at risk too			1
the fact that i was overweight meant i was at an even higher risk			1
' ever since i was small , i ’d seen my father injecting himself with insulin every day			1
it ’s not a nice thing to see			0
focussing on the options for losing weight helped me through the grieving process			2
' miss @entity7 was eventually approved for a gastric bypass on the @entity89			2
the day before the operation in november 2010 she weighed a dangerous 27st 9lb and was wearing size 32 clothing			1
she said : ' i had n’t been able to work because of my size and i was looking forward to making the switch , although i was very nervous about the operation and scared about the consequences			2
' in the week following the operation , miss @entity7 dropped more than a stone			2
within two years , she had shrunk down to 10st 4lb			0
she said : ' my life completely changed			0
i was able to go back to work and found @entity100 , my boyfriend , who ’s been amazingly supportive			0
' before undergoing the operation , miss @entity7 typically ate a bacon and sausage sandwich for breakfast , followed by a large chicken sandwich or a burger for lunch , and pasta with sauce with more bread for her evening meal			0
@entity14 , pictured here with supportive boyfriend @entity100 , says that her life has transformed since her weight loss today , mindful of the restricted diet she must stick to following her gastric band , she eats a slice of toast in the morning , followed by a small barm cake with chicken for lunch and a portion - controlled plate of tandoori chicken and salad for evening meal			1
miss @entity7 now weighs 12st and wears size 14 clothes			1
together with her boyfriend @entity129 , 26 , a debt advisor , she makes regular visits to the gym and is careful to stay active			0
she said : ' i ’m the right weight for my height now and i feel amazing			2
' without my dad ’s influence i would n’t have been able to get to where i am now			0
i know i could n’t physically have done it without having the push i needed			0
' i know dad would be very pleased for me			0
if i he was here now he would be amazed at the transformation i ’ve been through			0
