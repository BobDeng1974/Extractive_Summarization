by @entity0 @entity1 says he feels better now than he has in years — and admits it is all down to an operation he should have had long ago			1
the @entity6 skipper had surgery to tidy up his achilles tendons last november , at the end of the @entity11 season , but says he wishes it had been done before the @entity14 finals			1
@entity1 checked in for international duty on thursday night with a pep in his step and words of encouragement for @entity21 manager @entity20			1
veteran : @entity1 is feeling back to his best again after an operation on his achilles ‘ this is the best i ’ve felt in a long , long time , ’ said @entity6 ’s record goal - scorer			1
‘ i wish i had it ( the operation ) done a couple of years ago			2
it ’s a huge difference not just playing but just in general , just walking about and stuff			2
waking up in the morning , it ’s taken me five seconds to go to the toilet instead of 20 minutes , ’ he joked			2
@entity1 has n’t missed a game for @entity35 this season and his fine club form is a positive for @entity6 ahead of the @entity39 qualifiers			1
@entity20 plans to make four changes from the team which drew @entity42 0 - 0 in @entity43 on saturday night for @entity45 ’s first engagement with the @entity47 outsiders from @entity48			1
rep of @entity45 ( probable v @entity49 ) : @entity51 ; @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 ; @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity0 , @entity58 ; @entity1 ; @entity59			1
@entity1 has only played once under @entity20 , against @entity60 last november , and is eager to land running against @entity49 in @entity61 later on friday night			1
‘ of course you miss it , you certainly do , but i knew what the case was			2
i was going to come in for the two games and i ’m excited to be here , ’ he said			2
with only five strikers in @entity69 ahead of him on the all - time international list , @entity1 retains his zest for goals			1
‘ it ’s the same pressure as i ’ve had since i was 17 , so that will never change			0
i ’m going to put pressure on myself more than probably you guys do , ’ he said to the media			0
‘ my job is to score goals but listen , it does n’t matter if i score goals or if it ’s @entity84 ( @entity85 ) or @entity86 ( @entity87 ) or whoever it is among the other strikers			0
the important thing is winning games and certainly if we can score more goals than the opposition then we have a good chance			0
’ ever - present : @entity1 has n't missed a game for @entity35 so far this season goals have been in short supply for @entity6 in @entity1 ’s absence — just two in four games — but @entity1 is n’t perturbed by the dearth			1
‘ i know there ’s been talk about that but as long as players are getting the opportunities to score , that ’s always good			0
‘ we ’ve got strikers in the squad who are quite capable of scoring			0
at the end you want to finish the chances , and if i can help to contribute towards that , then great			0
’ with @entity117 keeping away from the media gaze , the younger @entity1 took centre stage in @entity120			1
he did n’t flinch when asked about the recent @entity121			0
‘ i heard the manager saying today that it ’s done now , he ’s here , we ’ll move on			0
as a group , we ’re delighted that he ’s staying			0
legendary : @entity1 is @entity45 's all - time record goalscorer with 62 goals in 131 appearances to date ‘ he ( @entity1 ) has been good since he ’s come in			1
we ’ve enjoyed him being in the group , ’ he said			0
@entity20 is uplifted by the arrival of his captain , especially with so many established players missing out			2
and @entity20 sees no sense of @entity1 ’s enthusiasm diminishing after 132 caps spread over 16 years and is eager to keep him involved			1
‘ he has been a quality centre forward for some considerable length of time			0
obviously , as he gets a wee bit older maybe he has to adjust his game in certain aspects			2
we will try to adjust ourselves to him			0
‘ he has just arrived so we have not formulated a plan just to accommodate him			0
he is easy and as long as he knows what his role is in the team , which he does , then the rest ( is ) straight forward			0
’ accommodating : as @entity1 gets older , @entity6 boss @entity20 recognises he must adapt his playing style			1

@entity1 has *overcome* *injury* problems after operation on @entity153
@entity6 's record goalscorer is eager to get back on *scoresheet*
@entity1 has not missed a game for @entity11 side @entity35 so far this season
@entity6 boss @entity20 wants veteran to tailor his game as he gets older
