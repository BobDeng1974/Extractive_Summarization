by @entity0 , education correspondent a primary school has transformed its pupils ’ achievement after introducing a compulsory nine - hour day			1
older children at @entity5 are required to start at 8.55am and stay until 6pm to take part in a free programme of activities and complete homework under supervision			1
the school – previously one of the worst - performing in the country – introduced the 45 - hour week to give pupils the same opportunities as those from private schools and wealthy backgrounds			1
remarkable : @entity5 in @entity19 ( pictured ) has won favour from inspectors with its 45 - hour weeks for over-nines - introduced to rival the standard offered by private schools in a dramatic turnaround in less than two years , it has now earned a ‘ good ’ rating by @entity25 – the second - highest			1
the watchdog highlighted the extended day as a key factor in the school ’s success , praising its ‘ outstanding leadership ’ and remarking that the timetable was improving pupils ’ life skills and commitment to education			1
in its former incarnation as @entity38 , the @entity19 school was among the bottom 200 performers out of 15,000 nationally and was condemned by inspectors as failing in 2010			1
the extended week was introduced in 2012 as the school became an academy sponsored by millionaire businessman @entity43			2
under the controversial timetable – longer than a standard working week – school starts at 8.55am , although pupils are free to attend a breakfast club from 7.45am			2
lessons finish at 3.30pm but those aged seven to 11 stay until 5pm for activities including horse - riding , cookery , cello lessons , first aid , dance and trips to @entity56			0

dr @entity72 , chairman of the @entity74 ’ and @entity75 ’ conference , which represents leading independent schools , says it undermines a ‘ proper childhood ’			0
but @entity78 , head of @entity79 , said : ‘ this is certainly not some @entity82 regime			0
pupils are happy and engaged and bounce out of school at the end of the day			0
’ the extended timetable is funded partly through the pupil premium , and donations from mr @entity43			0
mr @entity43 , who has been touted as a possible successor to @entity92 ( @entity91 ) @entity90 as chairman of @entity25 , said : ‘ i am determined to end the apartheid in education so commonplace in this country			1

’ education minister @entity104 praised the school ’s transformation as a ‘ brilliant example ’ .			2
