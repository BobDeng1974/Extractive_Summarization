you 'd be surprised if @entity1 took a holiday this summer after the @entity4 super agent represented four of the biggest transfers across @entity6			1
forget @entity7 , the @entity8 would probably win the @entity9 and @entity10 in its first season , and he even represented his compatriot upon his move to @entity14 in 2004			1
here 's the best @entity16 at this moment , and believe us , we could have made two world class teams , we just wo n't mention @entity18 to @entity19			0
he spent three years at @entity14 , making plenty of friends and enemies before returning last summer			2
path into @entity37 : @entity1 helped @entity7 with his move to @entity14 from @entity30 in 2004 @entity39 after @entity43 's retirement in 2011 , the @entity41 , just 20 at the time , became @entity19 's new no 1 and has remained there since			1
he 's had his moments , but @entity47 is gifted between the posts and is recognised as @entity19 's stopper for years to come			0
@entity19 's no 1 : @entity39 moved from @entity51 to @entity19 in 2011 @entity52 the @entity54 centre back moved from @entity30 to the @entity56 capital in 2007 for around £ 24million , and has had 60 caps for @entity58 since			0
@entity59 - born , @entity52 has two @entity61 titles and a @entity10 under his belt at the age of 31			0
at the back : portugues centre back @entity54 has had a successful career at @entity54 @entity67 with a fantastic career behind him , 36 - year - old @entity67 was another of @entity30 's stars to move to @entity14 in 2004			2
he had six years at @entity70 , before playing for @entity54 and now @entity71			0
leader : @entity67 was brought to @entity14 in 2004 alongside @entity7 @entity73 @entity1 pushed hard to get @entity73 to @entity19 on deadline day last year , but time ran out for the @entity4 duo			1
@entity73 is still at @entity54 , and has 46 caps for his country			0
stayed put : @entity54 's @entity73 nearly moved to @entity19 last summer @entity80 the big @entity82 centre back got his big move to @entity84 in the summer , and will learn plenty from partner @entity86 at the @entity87			2
the 23 - year - old is another from @entity30 , who have housed some of the world 's best talents in the last decade			0
force : strong defender @entity80 moved from @entity30 to the @entity87 in the summer @entity93 the man forever linked with a move to @entity19 , the holding midfielder is still at @entity97 having spent his youth career around @entity58			1
@entity67 is still at the @entity4 club , but surely a move is on the cards in january			2
big man : it is only a matter of time before @entity93 appears in one of the top leagues @entity107 @entity107 cost @entity71 £ 20million last summer , and is one of few big - money players left at the @entity82 club after a summer cull			1
with 71 caps at the age of 27 , the midfielder was another of @entity1 ' men from @entity30			0
slide : the @entity4 midfielder ( left ) is still at @entity71 having moved alongside @entity118 last year @entity118 @entity107 moved to @entity71 with @entity118 last summer for a combined £ 56million , but even moneybags @entity1 may not have predicted the @entity119 would be the hottest property in the world after a superb @entity122			1
he moved to @entity54 in july for £ 64million			0
@entity124 signing : @entity118 got his second big - money move in the summer , to @entity54 from @entity71 @entity126 despite helping @entity54 win the @entity10 last season , the @entity127 was soon on his way to the @entity9 with @entity19			1
a £ 60million move represented a @entity132 record fee , and @entity1 ' influence in the @entity9 was about to get even bigger ... step down ? @entity23 helped @entity54 win the @entity10 , but has ended up with @entity19 , out of @entity6 @entity20 @entity1 supposedly spotted @entity20 at a youth tournament , and the rest is history			1
the former @entity19 man won the @entity138 last season , and has been nothing but a joy to watch since bursting onto the scene over a decade ago			0
a superstar , and rightly considered the best player in the world at the moment			0
superstar : @entity20 won the @entity138 ahead of @entity147 last year @entity22 the @entity119 was n't able to impress at the @entity122 through injury , but a big - money loan move to @entity19 means the former @entity30 and @entity51 man can showcase his talent on a bigger stage than the @entity82 @entity153 with @entity71			1
@entity1 has dealt with @entity19 plenty of times now , with @entity18 , @entity156 , @entity157 and @entity158 all represented by him			2
represent : @entity1 ( left ) with @entity22 ( right ) before his move on loan to @entity19 @entity161 : ronaldo highlights			2

@entity4 super agent boasts *magnificent* team of players he represents
@entity1 also represented @entity7 for his move to @entity14 in 2004
@entity20 , @entity93 and @entity39 among those represented by @entity1
@entity22 , @entity80 , @entity118 and @entity126 all *enjoyed* big - money moves across @entity6 this summer
