despite the recent news that @entity2 had been given approval to offer low - cost flights from @entity5 to @entity6 , it seems that such a project may not be in the works after all			1
a statement , issued from @entity10 , @entity11 , shot down recent speculation about budget flights to the @entity6			2
' in light of recent press coverage , the @entity15 wishes to clarify that it has not considered or approved any transatlantic project and does not intend to do so , ' it reads			1
despite earlier reports that @entity2 was developing low - cost transatlantic flights , the company is now denying such plans however , it is understood that the ideas of such a transatlantic project is still being explored , but with the intention that @entity2 would not operate the flights			1
instead , any sort of budget @entity5 to @entity6 service , should it come into fruition , would be operated by a sister company under a separate brand			2
earlier this week , it was reported that @entity11 - based budget carrier was moving forward on plans to run services between key @entity5 cities and the @entity6 with one - way tickets costing as little as $ 15 ( Â£ 10 )			1
the news came on the heels of a statement made by @entity44 , the airline 's chief executive , last year			0
he told the @entity48 conference that @entity2 would be offering $ 15 flights to @entity50 and @entity51 , but also admitted that passengers would be expected to pay extra for everything from meals to baggage			0
chief executive @entity44 , has said that $ 15 flights were in development but ' four or five years off ' ' not every seat will be ( $ 15 ) of course ; there will also need to be a very high number of business or premium seats , ' he reportedly said			0
he 's also said in the past that the company has had a business plan in development for low - fare , transatlantic flights for awhile , but would need to wait until new aircraft could be ordered			2
' the difficulty is , i keep cautioning , is that there 's no availability of long - haul aircraft for another four or five years			0
' it remains to be seen whether or not @entity2 's possible plan will develop further or if a new sister company will emerge .			0

this week , @entity2 *announced* plans for low - cost @entity5 to @entity6 flights
however , *yesterday* , @entity2 issued *contradicting* statement
it reads : ' @entity2 has not considered or approved any transatlantic project '
