just when it seemed that everyone else should abandon hope against the machine - like quality of @entity4 , along came @entity5 to provide some inspiration			1
it took the relatively diminutive @entity8 , helped by an 02 @entity10 crowd fed up with one - sided matches , to show that the world @entity13 can be rattled , but ultimately yesterday ’s result turned out as expected			1
@entity4 is through to sunday ’s final of the @entity16 with a 6 - 1 , 3 - 6 , 6 - 0 victory over @entity5 , but it seemed a blessing that for the first time in this event he was made to sweat for it			1
videos scroll down to watch @entity4 has apologised for losing his temper with the @entity10 crowd on saturday afternoon @entity5 waves to the crowd in @entity28 after losing to @entity4 in the @entity29 world tour final semi-final djokovic at full stretch to return a forehand to @entity5 during the semi-final match at the @entity10 that will have been noted by whoever plays him at the strange hour of 6pm this evening , the winner of last night ’s all - @entity36 semi-final between @entity37 and @entity38			1
@entity4 has a strong but simmering temperament , and it boiled over at the start of an unexpected fightback from the hugely gifted @entity8 player early in the second set			2
the crowd — who in the past week have been disappointed by a diet largely consisting of uncompetitive matches — applauded a double fault from the @entity51 as he was broken back for 2 - 2			1
@entity4 responded at the end of the game by sarcastically clapping them with one hand on his racket strings , and he was so needled that he lost his form and his footwork temporarily			1
the 27 - year - old @entity51 apologised afterwards , and blamed himself rather than the throng of more than 17,000 spectators who were heavily behind the underdog			2
@entity5 lines up a forehand during a match in which he troubled the reigning champion @entity4 survived a scare against @entity69 , who took him to three sets in the semi-final djokovic with a look of full concentration as he returns a forehand against his opponent ‘ it ’s sport and they want to see a more interesting match , i made a mistake and let my emotions go			1
i lost my concentration , i wo n’t do it again , ’ he said			0
‘ the crowd has a right to cheer for who they want			0
some individuals were going over the line the whole match , but i should have known better			0
the truth is it ’s the end of the season and i ’m exhausted but i still think i will have enough energy tomorrow			0
’ he looked anything but the supreme warrior during the six out of seven games that he lost , which led to him conceding a set for the first time since @entity37 beat him in @entity98 a month ago			1
@entity5 has an outstanding record in deciding sets , and when he had two break points in its opening game an upset seemed on , only for him to blow his chance and then unravel as @entity4 regained his composure			1
that is the end of the season for @entity5 , but he has shown that if he can put his poor injury record behind him there are not many limits to what he can do next year			2
@entity113 is already looking ahead to 2015 and yesterday @entity114 became the latest pundit to urge him to employ a more expansive game if he wants to get back to @entity118 - winning form			0
‘ he ’s got all these shots in his armoury , my question is why does n’t he use them ? ’ asked @entity114			0
‘ he has to look at the way that he can be more offensive and more proactive instead of letting these players dictate to him			0
he ’s got as good a two - handed backhand as @entity4 , but he does n’t use it as much			2
’ @entity4 emerges from the smoke at the @entity128 to a rapturous welcome from the crowd world number five @entity5 enters the @entity10 ahead of his match against @entity4 while emphasising that he was applying high standards to @entity113 , @entity114 said : ‘ he ’s a great athlete , but he does too much running and , when he ’s doing too much running , he ’s not dictating enough			1
‘ it ’s about clarity of thought and that ’s when you ’ve got to take a step back and look at the whole set - up , the whole team and his whole lifestyle and see whether that is working as well as it can			0
‘ i do n’t think he has been playing the right way			0
because @entity113 ’s such a good player he ’s capable of winning the wrong way			0
’ @entity149 , the @entity150 teenager reckoned to have the most potential for a @entity153 player since @entity113 and @entity114 , was through to his first @entity155 final on sunday morning in @entity156 , @entity8 , and due to play @entity158 @entity157 .			2

@entity4 beat @entity5 6 - 1 , 3 - 6 , 6 - 0 at the @entity10 in @entity28
@entity4 will play either @entity37 and @entity38 in the final
the reigning champion sarcastically applauded the crowd at the @entity10
@entity5 will be disappointed to have lost the *momentum* of the match
