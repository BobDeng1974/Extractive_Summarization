an amateur photographer has used super speed cameras to capture the world 's most iconic brand names and fictional characters by snapping them - in water droplets			1
@entity7 , 45 , a policeman from @entity8 in @entity9 began ' liquid drop art ' in 2011 after he bought his first digital @entity12 camera			1
since he started his project , mr @entity7 has captured cartoon favourites like @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17 with his extraordinary photographic technique			1
@entity9 artist @entity7 creates artwork using water droplets and iconic images , such as this character from hit game @entity23 @entity26 smile : @entity28 's iconic and enigmatic portrait is given the drop art treatment			1
right , sunflowers by @entity31 is reflected twice in two separate droplets the smiley icon popularised by rave culture , framed in bright yellow mr @entity7 sets up his camera and flash rigs to capture the exact moment a droplet hits the surface , sometimes causing several drops to collide into each other			2
by dropping the water in front of pictures of brands and cartoon characters , the droplets create a unique reflection of the images a fraction of a second before the drop bursts			1
the process can be painstakingly slow and mr @entity7 often takes an entire day to capture just one perfect picture which he does from his kitchen			1
he said : ' it is quite a complex thing to do and very hard as water droplets are tiny , but it is my hobby and i enjoy it			0
' i set up in my kitchen by putting a full glass of water in the middle of the table , i then set up the camera in front of it before placing flash guns around and above the water			2

' i then use an @entity96 bag , like you would find in a hospital , to hang above it and i wait for the water from that to drip into the glass of water below			2
' once it does , it is all about timing and speed , i use a remote control to take the picture and hopefully , if everything goes to plan , the end result is a sharp , in focus and well lit piece of liquid drop art. ' as i said , it is complex and it does take a lot of practice , but in my opinion it is worth it as i think the images look brilliant and are something different for others to admire			0

right , @entity182 comedy actor @entity181 he added : ' they expect to pay for it but i do n't see the point , it is n't much trouble for me so i either put them on my website or @entity191 or just send it to them , it is no problem			0
' i hope to continue my art and get better , it may give me a career after the police force but you never know , for now i am just enjoying it			0
' i would advise anyone to get into it , i did n't think i would be able to do it but photography has made me see the world differently , it has given me a new outlook on life			1
