when one 16 - year - old @entity3 schoolboy asked his father to stop accompanying him to the bus stop to wave him off to school , his parent was less than impressed			1
the boy , named @entity8 , had begged his mother @entity9 : ' do n't let @entity11 go out there again '			0
but his father @entity12 had another solution in mind - a different fancy dress costume for every day of the year			1
much to @entity8 's horror , @entity12 proceeded to show up at the bus stop dressed in a variety of amusing costumes , among them a mermaid , @entity22 and even a bride			2
so dedicated was @entity12 to inflicting maximum embarrassment on his son , he even turned up in a toga and sitting on the toilet			0
despite his son 's embarrassment , as these hilarious snaps , compiled by @entity29 , reveal , he certainly seemed to enjoy the experience			0

the @entity3 father , named only as @entity12 , waved his son off to school in a different fancy dress costume every day
his son @entity8 , 16 , had asked his father to stop coming to the bus stop - but @entity12 had other ideas
@entity38 , @entity22 , a @entity100 and even @entity56 among fancy dress costumes worn
