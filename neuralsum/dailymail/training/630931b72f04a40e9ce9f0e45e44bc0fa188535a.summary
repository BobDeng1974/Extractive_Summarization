@entity0 last night ordered a fresh investigation to discover what happened to the missing dossier detailing explosive claims of a @entity6 paedophile ring			1
ministers including @entity8 and @entity9 have been rejecting calls for a full - scale public inquiry into historical child abuse , insisting a police investigation will be sufficient to get to the bottom of the claims			0
yesterday , however , the prime minister ordered the @entity18 ’s most senior official to launch an investigation amid claims that the department ’s response to the affair so far had been ‘ outrageous ’			1
probe : @entity0 , left , has ordered the most senior @entity18 official to investigate a missing dossier handed to @entity26 , the former home secretary , by @entity28 mp @entity27 about an alleged paedophile ring in @entity6 in the 1980s mr @entity0 said he understood mounting concerns about what happened to the dossier handed over to then home secretary @entity26 by @entity28 mp @entity27 in 1983			1
he said : ‘ that ’s why i ’ve asked the permanent secretary at the @entity18 [ @entity36 ] to do everything he can to find answers to all of these questions and to make sure we can reassure people about these events			1
’ he added : ‘ if anyone has information about criminal wrong - doing they should , of course , give it to the police			0
’ but the @entity48 can reveal that only seven detectives have been deployed by @entity51 chiefs to investigate the allegations			0
the tiny squad has been given the huge task of investigating historical allegations of child abuse relating to mps , a guest house where rent boys entertained @entity61 figures , a children ’s home and the notorious @entity64			2
the police inquiry , launched in november 2012 , is also responsible for investigating the activities of the disgraced @entity68 mp @entity67			0
sources close to the investigation , which has the umbrella name @entity72 , say it has been poorly resourced since day one and claim that @entity75 bosses have shown little interest in it			0
shadow home secretary @entity78 said the 2013 @entity18 review was ' not good enough ' and led to a ' lack of proper answers ' by contrast , nearly 200 detectives have been deployed on the investigation into phone hacking and bribery allegations involving journalists , while about 30 officers have been attached to @entity89 , the @entity90 inquiry into sex crimes committed by celebrities			1
the revelation that @entity51 boss sir @entity94 and his senior officers put just seven officers on @entity72 prompted widespread criticism and claims of a continuing cover - up			0
@entity100 , one of the original group of seven cross-party mps who wrote to the home secretary urging her to launch a ‘ @entity106 - style ’ inquiry into the abuse scandal , said : ‘ @entity9 will know that barely a handful of police officers are assigned to these investigations , so when they claim this is a matter best left to the police they are essentially consigning it to the dustbin of history			1
’ he added : ‘ they know full well that proper resources are needed to get to the bottom of years of cover up to protect establishment paedophiles , and without this there is no chance of the truth being uncovered			0
the public will now rightly want to know why our political leaders are not doing all they can to expose establishment paedophiles and bring them to justice			0
’ @entity130 mp mr @entity100 , who helped expose the full extent of @entity67 ’s vile paedophile attacks in a book serialised by the @entity48 , said more people have contacted his office in recent days with claims of a child sex ring at @entity6 and naming one particular mp from the 1980s			2
responding to mr @entity0 ’s announcement of a fresh investigation , he said : ‘ the prime minister knows that there is a growing sense of public anger about allegations of historical abuse involving senior politicians and his statement today represents little more than a damage limitation exercise			1
‘ it does n’t go far enough			0
the public has lost confidence in these kind of official reviews , which usually result in a whitewash			0
the only way to get to the bottom of this is a thorough public inquiry			0
’ from yesterday 's @entity48 : mps had called for an full - scale public inquiry to be launched thursday 's mail : pressure has been mounting on @entity0 to take action demands for a full - scale investigation into an alleged cover - up of a @entity6 paedophile ring increased this week leaving @entity26 , now @entity26 , facing questions over his handling of the explosive dossier handed to him by mr @entity27			1
@entity26 has confirmed he received a ‘ substantial bundle of papers ’ – which detailed allegations of a paedophile network within @entity176 and @entity177 – and passed them to his officials for investigation			1
but amid claims of an @entity61 cover - up , the @entity18 admits the dossier was either lost or destroyed			2
an internal review last year revealed that the @entity28 peer had written to mr @entity27 in 1984 saying the dossier had been assessed by prosecutors as worth pursuing and handed to police			2
yet the @entity48 has learned that the @entity75 can find no record that the @entity27 dossier was investigated by the force in the 1980s			2
speculation was mounting that sir @entity94 and commander @entity193 , who is overseeing the @entity6 paedophile ring investigation , could be hauled before mps to explain the alleged under - resourcing of the inquiry .			1

most senior @entity18 official will investigate alleged paedophile ring
