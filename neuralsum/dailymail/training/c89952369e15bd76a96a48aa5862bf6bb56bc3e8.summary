married to an @entity1 extremist in @entity2 complete with handguns and his @entity6 rifles , @entity7 's is no ordinary life			1
but it is a world away from her previous existence as the @entity14 teenager who wore jeans and platform heels and loved her mother 's home cooking			2
and hours after the beheading of @entity22 journalist @entity21 at the hands of a @entity25 jihadist , this 22 - year - old gloated on social media at his execution and vowed that she would be the first @entity25 woman to kill a @entity22 soldier			1

her @entity49 feed is littered with images of dead bodies and islamic state propaganda , but juxtaposed with these are pictures which belie the normal young girl she once was			2
the irony of the images she has posted of ' beautiful ' sunsets , baby seals and a kitten in a teacup alongside those of extremist horror are apparently lost on her			0
@entity31 – one of her many post-conversion pseudonyms – grew up in @entity14 , south @entity33 , as a @entity76 , and an acquaintance of hers told the @entity79 that she was ' very endearing and sweet			1

but it was at the age of 18 , four years ago , that she converted to @entity113 and began worshipping at the @entity114 – which has links to both the @entity117 killers of @entity118 and radical cleric @entity119			0
she admitted in a @entity121 report last year that when she began wearing the full face veil in @entity14 people on the street told her to ' go back to her country ' , to which she replied : ' i was born round the corner '			1
in the same footage she urges other @entity130 to ' stop being so selfish ... focusing on your families or studies ' and implores them to join her in @entity2 and join the holy war			2
horrific : @entity21 was brutally murdered by @entity135			1
dare disgustingly gloated on social media at his execution dare allegedly became radicalised online and moved to @entity2 in 2012 , before marrying her @entity86 @entity130 jihadist husband @entity85 , arranged by his mother			1

the @entity33 has admitted that her parents are unaware of her new life , and as well as the pseudonym @entity7 she goes by ' @entity152 ' meaning ' mother of @entity51 ' and @entity153 , meaning ' immigrant in @entity2 '			1
as her toddler sons @entity51 and @entity156 stumbled about her gun - littered living room floor last year , @entity36 was unrepentant of her decision to move to @entity2 and of her departure from the girl - next - door who traded her promising @entity25 life for one of violence and hatred			1
muslims attending friday prayers at the @entity33 mosque where female jihadist @entity31 used to worship today insisted it was not a breeding ground for terrorists			1
today people at the @entity114 spoke of their shock and horror at what she had said as they left the mosque in south east @entity33			1
a woman , in her early twenties wearing a white headscarf who would not give her name , said : ' i know @entity31			2
she attended the mosque a couple of years ago			0
' she 's a very nice girl , a good person , i had no idea she was fighting in @entity2			2
i 'm shocked to hear it , it seems so unlike her			0
' another woman said it was impossible to know @entity191 's motivations , but wondered why the media was so interested			0
she said : ' my father 's a soldier for the @entity25 army , yet no - one challenges him when he goes off to fight			2
why should it be any different for us ? ' either the media wants us to condemn going out to @entity2 to fight or it sees us as supporting terrorists			0
