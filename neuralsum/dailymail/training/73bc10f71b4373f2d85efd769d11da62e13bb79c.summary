by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 hailed @entity3 as one of the world ’s best coaches and the ‘ perfect ’ fit for @entity8 because of his experience , ambition and personality			1
@entity13 icon @entity2 watched from close quarters as @entity15 won the double with @entity17 in 2010 , only missing out on the @entity19 trophy in the final against @entity22 ’s @entity21			1
‘ he would be perfect for @entity8 because he is an internationally experienced coach and he understands @entity29 football , ’ said the @entity17 legend , who served the club as captain , manager and president			1
video : scroll down to watch profile of @entity3 kaiser : @entity2 ( r ) insists @entity3 ( @entity32 ) would be perfect as @entity8 's next manager heir to the throne ? the @entity35 , pictured with @entity36 ( r ) , is hot favourite to take over at @entity8 ‘ i do n’t know if it ’s a rumour or if they ’re really trying to sign him but if they agree with louis i think it would be a good part of the future			1
he won a lot of titles so he is experienced and he is ambitious			0
’ as for @entity15 ’s reputation for arrogance , which played a part in his exit from @entity17 in 2011 , @entity2 admitted : ‘ if you ask him a stupid question then it can be that his answer is a bit arrogant , but if you treat him with respect , then respect comes back to you			1
he was also very successful with @entity17			2
in the end there was a little discussion about the way he was handling his job so that ’s why they went separate ways — but for me he ’s one of the best coaches in the world			0
’ @entity2 was speaking to @entity73 as an ambassador of @entity75 ’s ‘ @entity82 ’ initiative , which brings children from different @entity79 countries together and takes some to @entity80 to attend next month ’s @entity19 final			2
having beaten @entity8 in the quarter - final , @entity17 are attempting to become the first team to defend the trophy in the modern era , although they are a goal down to @entity88 going into the second leg of the semi-final in @entity91 tonight			1
‘ it was not a perfect result , but @entity17 can be very happy it was only a 1 - 0 defeat when it could have been two or three , ’ said @entity2 , who is not the greatest fan of @entity94 ’s possession - based brand of football			1
fancy a pint : @entity15 is sprayed with beer after winning the @entity101 with @entity17 in 2010 winner ! @entity15 had great success with @entity17 before leaving due to tensions with the board ‘ he is a master for keeping the ball and there ’s always been a philosophy that if you are in possession , the opposition are not able to score goals , but it is not the most attractive part of the game			1
‘ to score from 30 metres is spectacular , more attractive than to keep possession but it ’s the philosophy of @entity94 and it has been successful with @entity118 and @entity17			2
’ @entity17 ’s team is largely based around those who won the @entity79 title last year under @entity122 , who was ousted to make way for @entity94			2
they are aiming for a third successive @entity19 final			0
‘ i like to watch the wingers , @entity126 and @entity127 , ’ said @entity2			2
‘ @entity128 is probably the best goalkeeper in the world and @entity130 is wonderful for team interest			0
@entity13 engineering : @entity17 are on course for a third successive @entity19 final after beating @entity8 in the quarter - finals wing men : @entity2 enjoys watching wide players like @entity127 ( @entity32 ) and @entity126 ( r ) ‘ @entity122 was really popular and he still is			1
he won the treble , the most famous titles in football , but he is 69 years old and so he is not the future			0
the future is @entity94 and if you have a chance to sign him which @entity17 did , i think it was the best move that can ever happen			2
’ even so , @entity17 can not expect to dominate the competition as they did in the 1970s , when @entity2 ’s team won a hat - trick of @entity79 titles from 1974 - 76			1
‘ you can see how difficult it is to play in this competition because no team have won it twice in a row , ’ he said			0
‘ new teams are getting stronger			0
it is a different game , different lifestyle and different materials			0
everything is much more professional than it was 40 years ago			0
’ homegrown : many @entity8 supporters would like to see @entity160 get the job permanently @entity162 : @entity2 may not love @entity22 , but he accepts he 's one of the world 's best coaches if @entity17 make it past @entity88 tonight , they could face @entity167 in the final			1
@entity2 once claimed @entity22 was ‘ rude and with no education ’ but he admires him as a coach			1
‘ @entity22 is @entity22 , i would n’t say the best but if you have @entity94 and if you have @entity22 it ca n’t be better , ’ he said			0
i like these kinds of people and he is one of the most successful coaches in the whole world			0
‘ yes , he can win it again , why not ? @entity167 have the chance to beat @entity181 at home , then they are in the final and in one game anything can happen			0
