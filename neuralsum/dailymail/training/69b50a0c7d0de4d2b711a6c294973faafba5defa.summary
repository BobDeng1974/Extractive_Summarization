provoked : police officers largely ignored taunts during this week 's rallies and showed restraint in arresting protesters restraint : police trailed protesters on bicycles and on foot during a friday demonstration , but went out of their way to keep the number of arrests down the men also were in a car that was stopped by police a week ago , leading to a @entity234 video of the stop that has prompted protesters to complain @entity223 were harassing the occupants , their attorney said			1

mounted : police horses blocked some intersections as groups of protesters who broke away from the main rally wound through the city on friday , police officers on bicycles and foot followed throngs of noisy activists through the streets of the city , but ignored taunts in an effort to avoid detaining people			2
