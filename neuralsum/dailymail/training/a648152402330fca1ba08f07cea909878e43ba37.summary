he had invited them to his home for steaks and they later went for what @entity9 thought was going to be a joyride			1
when he declined to share his alcohol with them , @entity9 said the man grabbed him by his feet and threw him out of the truck while parked along the desolate road			1
it was early evening and @entity9 had nothing - no wheelchair , no food , no water , no coat - to help him endure the flat desert scrubland			1

' i could have easily gave up and said forget it , but i said i 'm not going to freeze out here and i just kept on going , ' said @entity9 , who lives by himself and lost the use of his legs in a car crash years ago			1
on the third afternoon , a man in a blue pickup truck stopped and called for help			1
