by @entity0 & @entity1 published : 09:20 est , 3 august 2012 updated : 09:20 est , 3 august 2012 the @entity3 stock market staged a strong recovery today following yesterday 's disappointment over the @entity7 's failure to fire the ‘ big bazooka ’ required to save the single currency			1
the ftse 100 index was 52.37 points or 1 per cent up at 5,714.67 as the market got over the lacklustre statement from @entity7 president @entity14			1
@entity16 's @entity15 is 2.98 per cent up at 3,328.82 , with @entity18 's @entity17 also up 3.46 per cent at 6,834.59			1
it also came as @entity21 firms were revealed to have hired an extra 163,000 workers in july , beating economists ' forecasts			1
dithering : financial markets and the euro dived after @entity7 's @entity14 failed to give details on how to save the single currency but the @entity21 unemployment rate rose from 8.2 per cent to 8.3 per cent last month , as more people re-entered the workforce but failed to find a job			1
those factors were expected to prompt the @entity34 to launch further stimulus measures , and are believed to be behind the @entity16 and @entity18 blue - chip markets being up 1.5 per cent			1
last week @entity14 vowed to do ‘ whatever it takes ’ to shore up the eurozone			1
he added : ‘ believe me , it will be enough			2
’ that sparked speculation that the central bank would resume its government bond - buying programme and bring down soaring borrowing costs in troubled countries such as @entity48 and @entity49			2
but @entity14 struck a far more cautious note yesterday and – having left interest rates at 0.75 per cent – said the @entity7 would come up with ways to help struggling countries ‘ over the coming weeks ’			2
@entity55 - winning economist @entity54 said : ‘ @entity57 leaders have once again failed to rise to the occasion			1
’ vague : @entity14 said the @entity7 would come up with ways to help struggling countries ' over the coming weeks ' stock markets across @entity57 slammed into reverse following the announcement , and the @entity64 lost more than 100 points in a matter of minutes			1
it closed down 50.52 at 5662.30			2
the crucial 10 - year bond yield in @entity48 – the interest rate the government pays to borrow – lurched back above the 7 per cent level to 7.4 per cent			2
@entity49 borrowing costs hit 6.3 per cent			2
@entity73 , an economist at investment bank @entity74 , said : ‘ @entity14 ’s words are pushing the market into outright meltdown			2
’ reservations : @entity79 , head of @entity18 's central bank @entity80 , opposes the bond - buying programme @entity84 , an analyst at @entity86 firm @entity85 , said : ‘ @entity14 came to @entity3 last week and said , “ believe me , it will be enough ” , so everyone has been expecting the big bazooka			1
but he ’s turned up today and left the firing pin at home			0
’ @entity14 insisted the euro was ‘ irreversible ’ and warned traders that ‘ shorting the euro is pointless ’			0
but the single currency tumbled against the pound and the dollar			0
@entity97 , an analyst at @entity98 , said : ‘ that was so disappointing			0
in fact , it was dreadful – just rhetoric , platitudes and veiled promises – exactly what the market was not prepared to put up with			0
’ bond yields above 7 per cent are considered unsustainable and proved a tipping point for @entity110 , @entity111 and @entity112 , forcing them to beg for international bailouts			0
@entity115 has also been rescued by its @entity57 neighbours and it is feared that @entity48 and @entity49 will be the next dominos to fall , leading to a chaotic break - up of the eurozone			1
@entity48 has already been granted £ 80billion of aid to prop up its broken banks but that is widely seen as a prelude to a full - blown state bailout			0
the @entity7 was under pressure to wade back into the bond market and snap up @entity48 and @entity49 debt to cap borrowing costs			0
but @entity14 said there would be no immediate intervention amid opposition to bond - buying from @entity18 and @entity79 , head of its central bank , the @entity80			1
‘ it ’s clear and it ’s known that mr @entity79 and the @entity80 have their reservations about the programme of buying bonds , ’ said @entity14			0
analysts said the failure to deliver on its promises seriously undermined the credibility of @entity14 and the @entity7			0
@entity143 , a market analyst at @entity144 , said : ‘ what he said last week was they ’ll do whatever it takes			0
today it was more like they ’ll do whatever the @entity80 allows them to			0
‘ @entity14 looked like a man defeated in the press conference , which came shortly after his meeting with @entity79			0
today ’s conference really has shown who is king			0
’ @entity158 , @entity57 economist at @entity159 , said : ‘ after building up market expectations to near euphoric levels , @entity14 failed to deliver the policy to back up his promises of “ doing whatever it takes to save the @entity165 ”			1
‘ if the @entity7 does not follow up with some meaningful action in the near future , then there is a risk that markets lose all faith in @entity14 ’s ability to tackle this crisis			1
‘ @entity14 warned investors not to bet against the euro , but the trouble is those that are doing so have done rather well so far this year			0
