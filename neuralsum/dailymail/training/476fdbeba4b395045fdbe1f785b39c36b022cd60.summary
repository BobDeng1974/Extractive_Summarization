a @entity1 family who lived in the overseas territory of @entity3 for 20 years were ordered to leave because its government is clamping down on immigrants from the @entity1			1
@entity7 and @entity8 and their two children were given barely a month to get off the @entity12 island after his workplace burned down			1
now the couple have swapped sandy beaches and sunshine for concrete and drizzle after returning to mr @entity20 ’s home town of @entity21 , east @entity22			1
they were ordered to leave despite their daughter @entity24 , 12 and son @entity26 , six , being born in @entity3			1
dream over : @entity20 , with his wife @entity27 and children @entity24 , 12 , and and @entity26 , six , near their new home in @entity21			1
the couple were ordered leave @entity3 last month after mr @entity20 's business burned down mr @entity20 had worked as a spray painter , while his 41 - year - old wife ran a beauty therapy business and had clients including @entity36 and @entity37			1
mr @entity20 , 45 , said : ‘ my daughter is crying herself to sleep at night and the kids ask ‘ when are we going home , @entity41 ? ’ @entity3 is the oldest of @entity1 's @entity43			1
its @entity44 first met in 1620 , making it the oldest @entity46 legislature outside the @entity47			0
though @entity3 exercises a great deal of autonomy over its own affairs , the @entity48 remains responsible for its external relations , defence and internal security			1
the question remains of whether the territory should cut its links with @entity1 , but the last time a referendum was held - in 1995 - only a quarter of the 58 per cent turnout voted for @entity60 current government , led by premier @entity62 and her @entity63 , is in favour of independence - but the most recent opinion polls have consistently shown large majorities against it			1
‘ i do n’t understand how they could do this to us after we ’d been there so long			0
we had to sell all our belongings and get out , despite having worked hard and paid our way			0
’ @entity7 had friends fight for their right to stay but the @entity3 @entity48 refused to be swayed			2
he fears more ex-pats could be ordered to leave @entity3 as its government tightens up immigration and has called on the @entity80 to intervene			1
while @entity3 has granted permanent residency to @entity1 living on the island since 1989 , the couple missed the cut - off point by just two years			1
in 2010 , the government announced it would make it harder to gain and renew work permits in a bid to boost employment among citizens of the island			1
only highly - trained foreigners with particular skills are being granted work permits			1
painters and beauticians are among occupations that are among those professions that are ' proscribed '			0
the territory has even provided tax relief to those firms who employ previously jobless @entity3 , who accuse @entity1 and other immigrants of marginalising them			2
the @entity80 says it is unable to stop the island ’s government forcing @entity1 to give up their jobs and sending them back to the @entity1			2
mr @entity20 said : ‘ there are still people from @entity21 out there and more @entity1 will be sent home			2
you build a life up only to get kicked out			0
' happier times : the @entity112 and their children playing on the beach near their former home in @entity3 idyllic : the family sit beside a plam tree near their cottage on the paradise island in the @entity12 bad tidings : the letter the @entity112 were sent by the @entity3 government that gave them less than a months to settle up and leave he was 24 when he moved to the group of islands in the @entity12 from @entity128 in east @entity21 in 1991			1
he met @entity27 , of @entity129 , who was also on a work permit and the two later married			0
mrs @entity8 said : ‘ @entity7 ’s heart was in @entity3 and it is a lovely country			2
‘ my roots are in @entity133 and i class it as my home but i ’ve learnt so much on the island			0
’ the couple ’s dream life came crashing down when @entity7 ’s place of work burnt to the ground last year			0
mr @entity20 said : ‘ we were all made redundant but the local paper ran a story saying people were prepared to help us find work			2
‘ luckily , i still had job offer and i decided to take work at a @entity150 applied for my annual work permit and it was declined			0
‘ we did n’t know what to do and everyone said it would be sorted but it was n’t			0
’ @entity7 was sent a letter from the @entity157 , which advised him to settle his affairs , giving him a deadline of less than a month to leave the island			2
the letter stated : ‘ the minister of economy , trade and industry , after having reviewed the request , has refused the application			0
' you are now being advised to settle your affairs , together with your family and leave @entity3			1
’ the family are being backed by @entity170 mp @entity169 , who is vowing to take their case to ministers			0
however , they know it is very unlikely they will be able to return			0
mr @entity169 said : ‘ although @entity3 is a @entity1 colony , it has control over its own immigration system			2
‘ it ’s completely unjust that the @entity20 family should be cheated in this way when they have lived there for so long			1
i will do everything i can to help them			0
