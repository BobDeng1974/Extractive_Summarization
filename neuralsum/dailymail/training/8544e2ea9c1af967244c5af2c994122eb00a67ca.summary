@entity7 was broadcasting from the snow - covered @entity9 in @entity11 on tuesday night when he spotted his assailant running at him from out of the corner of his eye			1
the student - emitting a convincing battle cry - ran towards @entity7 , 49 , and tried to jump on him , but was instead met with the force of @entity20 's knee in his crotch			1
see below for video incoming : the @entity6 's @entity7 coolly lifted a knee when he saw a videobomber run towards him during a live broadcast from @entity11 's @entity9 on tuesday night ouch : the college student did n't know what hit him as @entity7 's knee went straight into his groin @entity7 stayed remarkably cool throughout the incident and continued talking as he shrugged off his attacker			1
the student could do nothing but run away - this time silently			0
' obviously , here at the @entity9 they are already having a good time , ' @entity7 quipped			1
the video quickly became an internet hit , with thousands applauding @entity7 for his quick work			2
but @entity7 was n't so impressed with the situation			2
pained : the man is filled with regret as @entity7 removes his knee and continues the broadcast ' honestly it happens more than you think , ' he told @entity48 's @entity47			1
' i 'm sick of it			0
' do i come up to somebody in their office and scream and yell at them as they 're doing their work ? no. this is my office out here so get out of my space , get out of my face , do n't touch me			0
' but he said that his practice at dealing with the video bombers made him prepared this time around			0
' i caught him coming out of the corner of my eye and i thought , " you know what , i 'm not just going to stand here " , ' he said			0
see ya : @entity7 shrugs off the man , who silently runs away following the unexpected response not so brave now : the video has become an internet hit - but @entity7 said he was fed up of people thinking they could interrupt and touch him while he was in his place of work ' " they 're gon na feel this , they 're going to remember this one "			2
' @entity7 , a father of two , has been dubbed the ' @entity82 of @entity83 ' for his commitment to covering the nation 's strongest hurricanes and blizzards - and now for taking on video bombers			0
