@entity0 has boldly declared that @entity2 ’s mission will be ‘ accomplished ’ in @entity3 by the time troops pull out next year – and that it should never again become a haven for terrorists			1
appearing to dismiss fears that @entity10 militants will return to wreak havoc , the prime minister , making what is set to be his last @entity15 visit to @entity2 bases in the country , gave a startling upbeat assessment of the troubled country ’s prospects 13 years into the conflict			1
asked by reporters if the troops come home with ‘ mission accomplished ’ , mr @entity0 said : ‘ yes , i think they do			1
i think they can come home with their heads held high			1
his remarks risked comparisons with the notorious ‘ @entity60 ’ speech given by former @entity53 president @entity52 about @entity54 in may 2003 after @entity56 ’s regime had been overthrown , only for an insurgency to take hold which claimed thousands of lives			1
standing on the flight deck of the @entity62 , mr @entity52 declared that ; in the battle of @entity54 , the @entity53 and our allies have prevailed			1
’ while the president did not utter the infamous phrase ‘ mission accomplished ’ , he made the speech against the backdrop of a huge banner bearing the slogan			0
echo : mr @entity0 's remarks drew comparisons with @entity53 president @entity52 's speech aboard the nuclear aircraft carrier @entity62 in 2003 , declaring that it was ' mission accomplished ' in @entity54 the incident came to represent the failure of the @entity53 and @entity2 to adequately prepare for the initial invasion and toppling of @entity56 's regime			1
mr @entity0 , by contrast , did concede that allied forces will ‘ not leave behind a perfect country or a perfect democracy ’			0
‘ @entity3 is an extremely poor country with a very , very troubled history , but the purpose of our mission is to build @entity3 security forces that were capable of maintaining a basic level of security so this country never again became a haven for terrorist training camps , and i think the @entity3 security forces are capable , ’ he said			2
' that has been the most important part of the mission			0
now it 's also good that there are six million children in school , including two million girls			0
it 's good that @entity3 now has far better health services than it ever did ten years ago , it 's good that here we are in @entity111 with elected district governors and basic levels of governance and services that did n't exist before			2
' all these are important but to me , but - and the @entity118 said this very clearly - to me the absolute driving part of the mission is a basic level of security so that it does n’t become a haven for terror			0
that was the mission and i think we will have accomplished our mission so our troops can be very proud of what they have done			2
' all combat troops will be pulled out of @entity3 by the end of 2014 – with numbers serving in the country already reduced from the peak of 9,500 to round 5,200 by @entity15			1
mr @entity0 said the timetable for withdrawal would not change depending on the security situation , saying ‘ we are sticking to that track			0
’ in june this year the @entity141 and security forces took over responsibility for security across the country with @entity2 forces in a supporting and training role			1
festive : mr @entity0 joined soldiers for breakfast at @entity36 , where the mess was decked out for @entity15 fry - up : the pm helped himself to bacon and eggs alongside serving soldiers @entity157 let the prime minister pull rank when it came to choosing which bunk bed to sleep in as they flew out to @entity3 together , the footballer has revealed			1
the pair shared a small cabin on a c - 17 military transport plane during the eight - hour journey from @entity166 in @entity167 to @entity36			2
@entity157 told reporters : ' i obviously let the @entity153 choose first			2
i was quite surprised myself			0
' i could n't hear anything			0
i was wondering if he was going to snore but i could n't hear anything with the noise up there and obviously you can hear the pilots all the time			0
' so , let 's say it was n't the best of sleeps , but who 's to complain ? we were in the best place			0
' mr @entity0 later praised his flight companion : ' well , he 's charming			0
he 's a very nice guy			0
' he added that since he took office in 2010 , ‘ what we 've done in that time is train up a hugely capable @entity141 and police force now numbering almost 350,000 and i think more than capable of providing the basic level of security that this country needs			0
’ military personnel are concerned that violence may erupt in the weeks running up to the @entity3 elections on april 5 when current president @entity196 will hand over to a successor for the first time since 2001			2
most of the troops coming home next year will only be pulled out in the summer after the elections are over			1
@entity2 military figures admitted that while the @entity3 security forces were performing well and the insurgency had been far weaker this year than in previous years , militants may still target candidate and election officials			1
one military source said : ‘ the campaign here is on track and the @entity3 are in a good place in the short , medium and long term			2
' the insurgency will have a go , they will still be having goes next year at electoral officials but against the very credible and capable @entity218			2
at the moment the insurgency are just trying to regenerate and reorganise for the next phase			0
’ mr @entity0 also had lunch with troops on the frontline and sent a ‘ @entity225 ’ – a letter from the @entity228 postal service -- telling the forces : ‘ you should be proud of what you have achieved here in @entity3			1
‘ it has been a long road and we have suffered losses but your work is building an @entity3 army and police force that can keep this country safe and keep our country safe too			2
’ flight : mr @entity0 made his visit after travelling on a c - 17 military transport plane from @entity166 in @entity167 to @entity36 strategy : mr @entity0 was briefed by @entity2 army officers at the forward operating base @entity247 at @entity111 in southern @entity3 meeting : mr @entity0 was joined by former @entity248 footballer @entity157 during the trip. , where they discussed a match at @entity252 between @entity248 and @entity3 asked whether mr @entity0 was seeking to echo former president @entity52 ’s announcement of the end of major combat operations in @entity54 in front of a banner reading ‘ mission accomplished ’ , the prime minister 's official spokesman pointed out that the words were initially introduced by a journalist to whose question he was responding			1
‘ i think it 's understandable			0
he was asked a question , he answered in the way he did , ’ said the spokesman			0
the spokesman added : ‘ the prime minister was explaining what the armed forces have achieved			1
is the situation in @entity3 a perfect one ? as the prime minister himself has said , no. ‘ but has the situation improved significantly in terms of the threat that the terrorists posed ? - because that 's the reason we intervened			1
yes , it has and that is as a result of the achievements of our armed forces			0
’ @entity0 , left , poses for pictures with former @entity248 footballer @entity157 , 2nd right , and unidentified @entity3 @entity286 officials and players the prime minister backed a plan for the @entity248 football team to play the @entity3 national side in a landmark ' peace match ' at @entity252 to mark the end of the conflict			1
he was in @entity36 with @entity248 legend @entity157 , who had a kickaround with troops to launch a major new partnership between the @entity286 and the @entity299			1
@entity0 said a symbolic football match when troops return home next year was an ' excellent idea '			1
he said : ' i ’m sure that there will be many very dignified national events that should take place ... but the idea of one part of it being a football match i think is a very nice idea			1
' the match is reminiscent of the truce match played between @entity248 and @entity313 during the @entity314			1
they played in @entity316 at @entity15 and the match between @entity2 and @entity3 troops is likely to take place around the centenary			1
mr @entity157 said it would be a ' fantastic occasion '			2
the footballer who retired last season after 14 years in the game , said : ' in the association the @entity3 @entity286 have with ours , i think there 's the opportunity for them to come over and train at our national centre @entity332 and there could be a fully fledged game at @entity252 one day - that would be fantastic to mark the occasion			2
' they are big into their football and big into the @entity299 so i think they would be welcomed			0
it would a fantastic occasion			0
i do n't know what the politics would be , but it would be great to mark the end of the conflict with a game certainly at @entity252			0
