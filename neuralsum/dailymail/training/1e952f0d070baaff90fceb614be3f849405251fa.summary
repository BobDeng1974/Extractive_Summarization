by @entity0 published : 16:04 est , 9 june 2012 updated : 16:04 est , 9 june 2012 fears : lord @entity2 talking to @entity3 @entity4 chief @entity2 has launched an out ­ spoken attack on reality tv , warning that it could wreck @entity9 's hopes of producing future @entity4 champions			1
@entity2 , who won his first @entity4 gold in 1980 , said shows such as @entity13 encourage young people to think they can become ' famous for nothing '			1
the chairman of the @entity17 ( @entity17 ) said : ' i do n't decry all reality tv			1
it identifies talent , but it encourages people to think you can be a celebrity in six hours			2
' i joined an athletics club when i was 11 years old and did n't get to the @entity4 until i was 23			2
' we have to be careful we do n't create a celebrity - driven culture where young people think it is better to be famous for nothing than be anonymous for doing something creative			1
' in an exclusive and wide - ranging interview with @entity3 , @entity2 - who remains the only man to win gold in the 1500m at successive @entity4 - also spoke candidly about his ' tough ' school days and the extra ­ ordinary influence of his late father and coach			1
sleek and slim as ever at the age of 55 , wearing a pink shirt with the top two buttons open and reclining in his 23rd - floor office in @entity44 's @entity43 , @entity2 looks the archetypal , well - groomed @entity46 slicker			1
fame : @entity48 with fellow celebrity judge @entity49 on the @entity13 yet he failed his 11 - plus and his was no gilded upbringing			2
' if you were brought up in @entity52 in the @entity53 , went to an inner - city secondary modern and your name was @entity2 , you learned how to survive			1
you learn to handle yourself			2
' his steely core comes as much from his formidable father @entity59 as it does from his native city			2
during the @entity62 , @entity61 survived his ship being torpedoed			0
picked up by a @entity65 boat , he later escaped en route to a prisoner - of - war camp by leaping off a train and walking across the @entity69 to @entity70			2
but there he was jailed for six months for having the wrong papers			0
years later , he had a blazing row with a bolshie athletics official and his son commented : ' you do n't scare easily			0
' @entity59 , who died in 2008 , replied : ' i do n't scare at all			0
the last 43 years have been a f * * * * * * bonus			0
' when @entity2 lost the 800m @entity4 final to his great rival @entity82 in 1980 , his father told him - and the world 's media - he had ' run like a * * * * '			1
unlike modern budding @entity86 , @entity2 's only sponsors were his hard - up parents			1
gold rush : lord @entity2 leads the 1500m semi-final , followed by @entity70 's @entity90 , at the 1984 @entity91 , where he won gold ' it bred a hardier competitor , ' he says			1
' no athlete is going to under ­ perform in @entity44 because of lack of funding			0
the @entity98 has changed the landscape			0
' the words are said with feeling			0
however , he admits today 's youngsters have more distractions			0
' when i first joined an athletics club , it was the focus of my world			0
there was little tv and no computer games			1
' lord @entity2 also touched on the possibility that sprinter @entity113 , whose ban on competing because of a drugs offence was overturned earlier this year , could wear a @entity117 vest at the @entity118			1
' i am unreconstructed on this , ' he says			0
' i would like to see a life ban			0
if you take drugs to artificially enhance your performance , you are stepping out of the moral framework of sport			2
' athletes on drugs who competed for the @entity130 in @entity2 's heyday had an excuse , he says			1
' they had no idea they were being given drugs at the breakfast table			1
' of @entity137 , @entity2 says : ' if he competes he should receive every courtesy			1
' but he warns : ' drugs cheats should think very carefully before coming to @entity44 : we have the most advanced tests in any games			2
you run a serious risk of getting caught			0
' overturned : @entity113 runs the @entity145 in @entity146 last month turning to @entity9 's chances this summer , @entity2 is far from confident about achieving the target of finishing fourth in the medals table , as in @entity154 , when we nudged @entity151 into fifth place by a single bronze medal			1
' you do n't have to give the @entity151 much of an excuse to get back at you			0
it 's in their dna			0
' he says the @entity65 , @entity162 , @entity163 and @entity164 pose the biggest threat			0
lord @entity2 's steely core is again evident in his defence of his £ 357,000 - a - year salary as @entity17 chairman			1
@entity2 , who travels in a chauffeur - driven @entity170 , says he is worth it : on a typical day , he starts work at 7am and finishes at midnight			1
he also defends the ruthless way ' @entity4 police ' have stopped anyone else exploiting the @entity118 ' commercial potential			2
an @entity178 kebab shop called ' @entity4 ' was forced to change to ' @entity179 '			0
' i am unashamedly protective of it , ' he avows			0
' i have to protect the people who have put a lot of money into this			2
i am going to get this project across the line with a balanced budget so the public wo n't have to pick up the bill			0
' rumours : lord @entity2 's judo sessions with @entity193 fuelled bogus rumours they were gay lord @entity2 was a @entity195 mp from 1992 to 1997 and @entity193 's chief of staff when the former @entity195 leader was defeated in the 2001 general election			1
he became a peer in 2000			0
his spell with @entity201 is best remembered for their lunchtime judo sessions , which fuelled bogus rumours that they were gay			1
' gay ? ' splutters @entity2 , in fits of laughter			1
' there was nothing weird about it			0
when @entity193 became leader , he said to me , ' i know how hard this job is going to be			2
i need to be in shape			0
what do i do ? ' i said , ' what sports do you like ? ' he said , ' martial arts			0
'' lord @entity2 arranged for them to wrestle on the judo mat , supervised by @entity4 silver medallist @entity217			1
' @entity193 got up to a blue belt			2
' lord @entity2 has four children by ex-wife , equestrian @entity220 , and had an affair with fashion designer @entity222 in the @entity223			1
he married magazine editor @entity224 , ten years his junior , last july			0
his friends say his ambition is to be president of the @entity228			0
lord @entity2 plays it down but , like the canny politician he is , does not rule it out			1
if @entity233 goes well , his credentials will be as unbeatable as he was on the track .			2
