one in three @entity1 ca n't name a single branch of the @entity1 government , an embarrassing , new poll has found			1
executive , legislative or judicial would all suffice , but a surprising 35 percent of @entity1 were stumped by the basic civics question , the @entity7 's @entity6 , revealed on wednesday			1
a mere 36 percent of @entity1 were able to name all three , pollsters discovered			1
survey - takers were even more unlikely to be able to answer other , albeit less rudimentary , questions about the @entity1 government , including what political party controls the upper and lower chambers of @entity14 and how many votes it takes to overturn a presidential veto			1
do you know which branch of the government operates out of this room ? if you do n't , you 're not alone			0
a new poll found that a mere 36 percent of @entity1 could name all three branches of government			1
( hint : the people pictured here are @entity27 ) most @entity1 also were n't aware that the @entity28 , led by @entity30 rep. @entity29 , control the @entity31 the @entity32 is controlled by the @entity33			2
senate majority leader @entity34 , left , is pictured here with @entity31 minority leader @entity36 , right , during a rare joint session of @entity14 this morning the @entity28 controls the @entity31 , but only 38 percent of @entity1 surveyed were aware of that			2
half as many , 17 percent , thought that @entity33 ruled the roost			0
meanwhile , a plurality of @entity1 , 44 percent , admitted they had no idea who holds a majority of seats in the @entity31			2
most @entity1 were also confused about which party runs the @entity32 , with 38 percent correctly identifying the @entity33 as the political group in power			2
another 20 percent thought @entity28 were in charge of the @entity32 while 42 percent claimed ignorance			0
asked about the procedure for overturning a presidential veto , less than a third of respondents accurately argued that it takes a two - thirds majority vote by both the @entity31 and the @entity32 to overrule the nation 's leader			0
one in five survey - takers were woefully under - educated about how checks and balances work , as well			1
poll - takers found that 21 percent of @entity1 think a 5 - 4 @entity63 decision goes back to @entity14			1
though the poll was taken in @entity66 , it was only just released this thursday , which was federally recognized as @entity68 in @entity1			0
' although surveys reflect disapproval of the way @entity14 , the president , and the @entity63 are conducting their affairs , the @entity6 survey demonstrates that many know surprisingly little about these branches of government , ' @entity6 director @entity69 said in a statement accompanying the results of the poll			0
' this survey offers dramatic evidence of the need for more and better civics education , ' @entity69 said			0
the frightening outcome of the civics test inspired @entity6 to join 25 other non-profit organizations , including the @entity88 and the @entity89 , in creating the @entity90 .			0
