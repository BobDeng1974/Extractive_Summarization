president @entity0 says he 's declining to meet with @entity1 during the @entity4 leader 's visit to the @entity5 in march because it would be ' inappropriate ' for him to meet with the prime minister two weeks before an election in that country			1
@entity1 's trip has become a diplomatic sore point with political overtones on both sides			1
house speaker @entity14 , a @entity15 , invited the @entity4 prime minister to address @entity17 without informing the @entity18 or congressional @entity19			2
originally scheduled for february , the @entity18 first said @entity0 would consider meeting with the foreign head state			1
but after @entity14 acquiesced to a request from @entity1 to move the speech to march 3 so that he could the annual @entity24 ( @entity24 ) conference in @entity25 , a spokesperson for the president 's @entity27 said a reunion was no longer on the table			1
president @entity0 says he wo n't meet with @entity4 prime minister @entity1 when he visits the @entity5 in march because it would be ' inappropriate ' two weeks before @entity4 's election a meeting so close to @entity4 's march 17 election could be seen as helping @entity1			1
' i 'm declining to meet with him simply because our general policy is we do n't meet with any world leader two weeks before their election , ' @entity0 said in an excerpt of a @entity43 interview with @entity44 released on wednesday			1
' i think that 's inappropriate , and that 's true with some of our closest allies , ' the @entity46 president told @entity44 after pointing out that he speaks with @entity1 ' all the time			2
' @entity0 said he met with @entity53 prime minister @entity52 in an election year because he scheduled his recent visit to @entity25 far enough away from his country 's election so ' that it does n't look like in some ways we 're meddling or putting our thumbs on the scale			1
' the @entity5 president would n't comment on @entity14 's invitation or @entity66 's decision to accept it , saying he 'd leave that aspect for the two leaders to sort out			0
@entity18 minority leader @entity70 has said both men 's actions were ' inappropriate , ' however , and the @entity0 's spokesman said @entity14 's speech violate normal ' protocol , ' @entity1 's trip comes amid delicate negotiations between world powers and @entity79 over its nuclear program			1
some @entity5 lawmakers , @entity46 and @entity15 , have embraced @entity4 's skepticism on the talks and want to impose additional economic sanctions on @entity85			1
a group of @entity19 sent @entity0 a letter on tuesday saying they would hold off on pushing for sanctions for two months			0
@entity1 , whose relations with @entity0 are strained , has defended his planned speech as a moral obligation and a strategic necessity			2
he said on sunday his priority was to urge the @entity5 and other powers not to negotiate an @entity79 nuclear deal that might endanger @entity4			0
' our general policy is we do n't meet with any world leader two weeks before their election , ' @entity0 said in an excerpt of a @entity43 interview with @entity44 released on wednesday the @entity0 administration has said negotiations are crucial to maintaining pressure on @entity85 and hopefully achieve a breakthrough by the end of june			1
' for us to undermine diplomacy at this critical time for no good reason is a mistake , ' @entity0 said in the @entity43 interview			2
@entity0 said he had n't yer heard a ' persuasive rebuttal ' to his argument that the current sanctions regime was created to force @entity79 into diplomatic negotiations			0
so far , he said , @entity79 has n't violated an interim agreement			0
' we have lost nothing during this period of negotiations , ' he said , yet we have a ' chance ' at making sure @entity79 does n't develop a nuclear weapon			0
the @entity5 president again promised to veto any legislation that calls for new sanctions on @entity79 before talks have concluded and reiterated a commitment to further punish @entity79 ' the day after ' it walks away from a ' reasonable ' deal			0
with @entity15 now in control of the @entity19 , what makes the administration so sure that any deal it approves would also get the green light from the upper chamber			0
' i think it 's important for us to actually have a deal in place , and then make an argument for what the deal is , ' @entity0 said , restating his position that he would take ' no deal over a bad deal			0
' if he were to come to the @entity19 with a deal scientists say would stop @entity79 from becoming nuclear capable and @entity15 still were n't on board , @entity0 said a public debate would ensue in which he would ask members of @entity17 why they would ' prefer a potential military option that would be less effective in constraining @entity79 's nuclear program and would have extraordinary ramifications at a time when we 've already got too many conflicts in the @entity158			2
' ' and i 'm pretty confident i can win that argument , ' he added .			0

' our general policy is we do n't meet with any world leader two weeks before their election , ' @entity0 told @entity43
