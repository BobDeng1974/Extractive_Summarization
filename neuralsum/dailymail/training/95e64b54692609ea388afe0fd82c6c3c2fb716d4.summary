it may seems like just another dance remake at first glance			2
but look a little closer and there are indications that set this particular remake apart from any other			2
as the dancers jump , grind and thrust , the footage zooms into red scars that dissect their skin and large lumps on their bodies			0
that ’s because the women in the recreation of @entity19 ’s ultra-sexy @entity17 video are all cancer patients			0
the ladies who took part in the remake of @entity19 's @entity17 are at various stages of battling cancer the @entity27 patients and survivors prove that they ’re not defined by their illness when they set out to re-enact one of the sexiest music videos ever			1
the idea was conceived by @entity33 , an organisation that wants people to be active after they are diagnosed with cancer , and after their treatment			1
their aim was to demonstrate the positive effect of physical activity on the body and mind			1
and that no one should let cancer kill their confidence			0
the organisation believes that physical activity should be a part of cancer treatment			1
the video ends on the shot of the group 's ' dance instructor ' walking towards the lone male dancer in the class			0
as she gets closer to him she takes off her long , blonde wig not what it looks like : at first glance , it seems to be just another video but close - ups show the scars of recovering patients getting sexy back : the video was made by @entity33 which believes activity helps aid recovery @entity33 was founded by nine - times @entity72 marathon champion @entity71 , who after her own diagnosis , joined forces with @entity75 in november 2007 and started the organisation			1
the group made the video not just to prove that cancer patients and survivors can still be sexy after a diagnosis but also to show that physical activity helps in recovery			1
the dancers in this video were given training and and then flown to @entity85 , where they were taken to the same studio where the original video was shot			2
one woman who took part in the video said : ' we believe in confidence			2
that 's why we set out to remake one of the most daring music videos ever , starring cancer patients			0
' we did this to raise awareness			0
we did this to prove that cancer does n’t have to kill your confidence			0

@entity27 *sufferers* and survivors were given training and flown to @entity85
the *re-enactment* was organised by *charity* @entity33
the organisation said physical activity should be part of treatment
