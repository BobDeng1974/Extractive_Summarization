by @entity0 , @entity1 editor published : 17:51 est , 12 august 2013 updated : 05:25 est , 13 august 2013 @entity3 's biggest water company wants to impose a £ 29 surcharge on millions of customers			1
@entity6 has made profits of £ 1.7billion over the last five years on the back of a succession of inflation - busting increases in bills			1
at the same time it has paid dividends of some £ 1.4billion to its private owners , including investment funds owned by the governments of @entity17 and @entity18			0
@entity6 is expected to pay about £ 4million pounds for the damage done in @entity20 when a three foot wide water main burst but it now wants its 14million customers to dig deep into their pockets yet again to pay the one - off surcharge because of a raft of extra costs it faces			1
the proposal was immediately condemned by the official customer body , which called on the industry regulator , @entity31 , to block it			1
@entity6 justified the surcharge by saying it had suffered a bigger than expected drop in income because of customer bad debt			1
there had also been a £ 66million bill for maintaining thousands of miles of private household sewers , it said			0
the company is also having to find millions of pounds to buy land for the @entity42 – a vast super-sewer for @entity44			0
last week dozens of businesses and homes were flooded in south @entity44 after a three foot wide water main burst near @entity48 , with parts of the suburb submerged under a metre - and - a - half of water on wednesday			0
@entity6 and its insurers are expected to pick up a bill of around £ 4million for the damage			2
critics say the company would have more than enough money to cover all these costs if it had not given away so much in dividends			2
sir @entity60 , chairman of the @entity61 in the @entity62 , said : ‘ many other water companies absorbed the costs that @entity65 say they are facing – and without applying for a further price increase			0
@entity6 should do the same			2
@entity6 justified the surcharge by saying it had suffered a bigger than expected drop in income because of customer bad debt ‘ our research shows one in seven customers say they ca n’t afford their water bill			1
@entity6 ’s price hike will add to the problem			2
’ the company already plans to put up bills by 1.4per cent above @entity80 inflation in april , which will raise the annual figure from £ 354 to around £ 370			0
with the new surcharge , the figure would rise to almost £ 400			0
water bills are set to rise next year - with or without an extra charge from @entity6 @entity6 has gone through several foreign hands since privatisation in 1989			1
since being sold to a consortium headed by the @entity89 bank @entity88 , in 2006/07 , it has been weighed down with billions of pounds of debt , and massive interest payments			0
this tactic has played a part in allowing the firm to pay zero corporation tax on its huge profits			0
a recent study by the @entity99 think - tank condemned the way water companies have been allowed to give billions of pounds in dividends to largely private investors			0
it called on the government to limit the stellar dividends			0
@entity6 provides some eight million homes with water and 14 million with sewerage services			1
its prices – as with all water companies – are set on a five - year cycle with figures agreed by @entity31			1
@entity65 insists this regime allows it to come back and argue for a surcharge to cover unusual costs			1
chief financial officer @entity117 said : ‘ these significant costs could not be quantified at the beginning of the current pricing period ; their scale is unique to @entity6 ’s operations , project commitments and catchment area			1
’ the company would prefer the £ 29 surcharge to be spread over several years to ‘ avoid a spike in bills for our customers ’ , he said			2
the decision on whether to allow the surcharge will be made by @entity31			2
chief executive @entity132 said : ‘ we have made it clear to companies we expect them to talk to their customers , listen to them and take account of their customers ’ views			0

14 million customers will have to pay a one - off surcharge to cover costs
calls for industry regulator @entity31 to block the proposed charge
@entity6 said they have had a drop in income *due* to customer debt
