stock image used patients are being struck off by @entity8 dentists for failing to attend just one check - up , an investigation has found			1
others are having to travel to surgeries 40 miles away because those nearby are refusing to take - on new patients			1
some @entity8 dental practices have waiting lists of two years which is leading to many patients giving up and paying hundreds for private treatment			1
research by @entity18 , which campaigns for patients ’ rights , found that only 1 in 5 surgeries are taking on new patients			1
and in some cases dentists are striking patients off for failing to attend a check - up even when there are exceptional circumstances			1
one woman from @entity29 was deregistered for missing an appointment because she was visiting her husband in hospital with cancer			0
another 65 - year - old man in @entity35 , @entity36 , rang his practice needing new dentures only to be told he had inexplicably been removed from their system			2
the surgery refused to re-register him as it was n’t taking on any more @entity8 patients so he was forced to pay £ 760 to have them done privately			1
he said : ‘ i ’m a 65 year old pensioner , i called up my dentist for new dentures			0
i was told that that i was “ no longer on our computer ”			0
‘ they advised me to call them every month to check if they were taking @entity8 patients , but they were only taking on private patients			1
in the end i had to go private and pay £ 760 for new dentures and i am on pension credits			0
‘ it ’s degrading ringing up lots of people , i should n’t have to jump through hoops to get new dentures			0

@entity64 , chair of @entity18 , said : ‘ we hear a lot in the news about people struggling to access their gps but it would seem getting an appointment with an @entity8 dentist is even more frustrating			2
’ ‘ patients are constantly being fed confusing and inaccurate information about who is and is n’t currently offering @entity8 treatment , and are feeling like they have to opt for costly private treatments such as hygienist appointments so that they do n’t get struck off the books			1
@entity64 , chair of @entity18 , said the delays were ' simply not acceptable ' ‘ it ’s simply not acceptable and such basic consumer concerns must be addressed when the @entity82 comes up for renewal next year			0
’ the watchdog – which was set up in 1991 – rang round 300 of the 8,000 @entity8 dental surgeries in @entity18 to enquire if they were taking on new patients			1
on average just 40 per cent were although in @entity36 and @entity89 the figure was just 1 in 5			2
another patient in @entity35 said : ‘ i have been looking for a dentist for over 3 months and have still not found one			0
‘ i have rung the dentist but they keep advising me to call back after 2 weeks			0
i am now in extreme pain			0
i have contacted all local dentists but they are all saying that they will only take on private patients			2
‘ i do n't want to be going to @entity98 but the problem is getting worse , if i had been seen 3 months ago then i might not be in the pain that i am in today			0
’ concerns have been raised about the state of @entity102 since a contract introduced by @entity104 in 2006 designed to improve efficiency			0
but it resulted in many surgeries stopping accepting new patients and up to a million are thought to have lost access to an @entity8 dentist as a result			2
dentists earn an average of £ 74,000 although the contract which sets out how they are paid is due to be renegotiated next year .			0
