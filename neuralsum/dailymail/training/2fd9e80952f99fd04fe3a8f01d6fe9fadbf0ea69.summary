by @entity0 published : 17:39 est , 22 march 2013 updated : 18:05 est , 22 march 2013 @entity1 has a rare and cruel amalgam of disabilities			1
she has a mind that is at once child - like and beset by the problems of old age			0
her short - term memory is waning ; her ability for cogent thought is declining			0
she has both learning difficulties and dementia			2
yet she is just 34			0
however , there is one subject on which her clarity of thought is undimmed			0
@entity1 knows she loves her basset hound @entity17			1
and the little dog , in turn , adores her			2
best friend : @entity17 , a basset hound with a bionic paw , has formed a close attachment with her owner @entity1 who suffers from dementia and learning difficulties but there is something about the bond between @entity1 and her dog that transcends the normal ties between owner and pet : it does not seem fanciful to suggest @entity1 and @entity17 have a special empathy because they are both disabled			1
@entity1 was born with cerebral palsy , and a rare chromosomal abnormality precipitated her decline into senility ten years ago			1
her mental deterioration is mirrored by a physical one			0
she finds it painfully hard to walk			0
most of the time she uses a wheelchair			0
@entity17 also has difficulties with locomotion			1
she was born without a foot on her left front leg			1
the condition , called ectrodactyly , is particularly irksome for bassets , who have very deep chests and stumpy legs			0
so when , in christmas 2011 , @entity1 wrote her annual letter to @entity57 , her thoughts were not for herself , but with her new , three - month - old puppy			1
@entity59 : owner @entity1 has developed an unshakeable bond with her pet dog , particularly after she rescued @entity17 from being put down ‘ i wrote , “ @entity57 , i would like a new leg and foot for @entity17			1
” i love her very much and i said , “ i ’d be sad if she has to go to heaven ” , ’ she remembers			0
@entity57 ’s reply ? ‘ he said he ’d do his best , but that he could not promise , ’ recalls @entity1 ’s mum @entity69			1
however , small miracles do occur			0
ten months later , vet @entity72 carried out ground - breaking surgery on her at his @entity75 animal hospital , making her the world ’s first bionic dog , with a new shoulder and foot			1
the surgery , charged at cost , came to £ 10,000 , half of which was paid for with donations to the ‘ @entity17 fund ’ that @entity69 set up			1
a fter eight weeks in intensive care , last january @entity1 and @entity17 were reunited			1
it was a day neither @entity69 nor @entity72 will ever forget			0
‘ @entity1 sat on the floor in one of the consulting rooms , ’ remembers @entity69			1
‘ we could hear the bump , bump of @entity17 ’s temporary new foot on the floor in the passage , then she bounded in			1
she went straight to @entity97 and licked her nose , and she was absolutely euphoric			0
’ @entity72 , too , felt vindicated			0
he ’d wrestled with the ethical dilemma of whether it was right to put a dog through such major surgery			2
when he saw @entity1 ’s delight , he knew he ’d made the correct decision : ‘ when i brought @entity17 in with her new foot , @entity1 laughed out loud			1
‘ she threw her arms round me , and those moments are what i live for			0
i got unbelievable happiness from seeing this dog running round , without pain , and @entity1 ’s utter joy			1
’ @entity72 ’s operation was pioneering and unique			0
although joint replacements and prosthetic limbs are relatively commonplace in veterinary science , the surgery on @entity17 broke new ground because she does not have a false leg strapped on to a stump			1
instead , her foot is attached to a permanent metal peg in the bone of her lower leg			2
‘ dogs find it difficult to cope with prosthetics , ’ explains @entity72			0
‘ they tend to chew them			0
and bassets find it particularly hard to walk on them			0
’ ground - breaking : @entity1 made sure that @entity17 had the first operation of its kind in @entity137 so that @entity17 could walk about properly @entity17 is far more than a pet to @entity1			1
she is her constant companion and her best friend			0
she has changed her life , irrevocably , for the better			0
@entity1 is the eldest of divorcee @entity69 ’s six children , the youngest of whom is 21			1
@entity69 , 54 , has raised @entity1 as a single mum for 23 years and lives with her in an adapted bungalow in @entity147 , near @entity148 , @entity149			1
once a clerical officer and manager of a dog - training centre , @entity69 is now her daughter ’s full - time carer			2
@entity1 needs help to wash , dress and feed herself			1
she was , says her mum , a happy young woman until the onset of dementia , when she was 24			2
‘ one day @entity1 started talking about events from her childhood , but could n’t recall what she ’d had for breakfast , ’ says @entity69			1
special wish : @entity1 had sent a letter to @entity165 wishing for @entity17 to have a new foot and her dream came true specialists carried out a battery of tests			1
to compound her learning difficulties — @entity1 has the mental age of a seven - year - old — it emerged she also had a chromosomal abnormality leading to frontal lobe dementia			1
the condition led to depression and a disturbing bout of self - harming			0
‘ @entity1 ripped out clumps of her hair ; her scalp bled			1
she bruised herself by twisting her skin			0
she destroyed her fingernails , ’ says @entity69			0
‘ it was heartbreaking to see my sweet - natured daughter sink into this state			0
she was not engaging with anyone			0
’ it was at this nadir that @entity69 decided to breed a litter of pups from the family ’s beloved basset @entity195			0
two pups were born : the first , @entity197 , was robust and energetic and became pet to @entity69 ’s son @entity199 , 21			2
the other was @entity17 — with her bad foot			1
‘ i asked our local vet if we should put her to sleep , but he said to take things one week at a time , ’ says @entity69			0
difficult start : @entity17 was born without a foot but a local vet made her a bionic one , half of which was paid for by charitable donations to the ' @entity213 ' the puppy developed an intuitive bond with @entity1			1
it was as if they sensed each other ’s frailties			0
‘ @entity17 is quiet and gentle			1
she knew she should be careful with @entity1			2
they became inseparable , ’ says @entity69			0
‘ she ’d lie against @entity1 ’s chest , follow her up to bed			2
@entity221 was , there was @entity17			2
’ soon , @entity1 became smiley again			2
but as @entity17 grew , the problem with her leg was magnified			2
before christmas 2011 , the family went to see vet @entity72 , 45 , owner of @entity229 , a specialist centre in @entity231 , near @entity232 , @entity75			0
‘ he said we had three options : to put @entity17 to sleep , to have her leg removed , or to see if an operation might be possible when she was more developed			2
’ @entity1 , meanwhile , had written to @entity57 , and @entity69 was terrified of losing the pet who ’d transformed her			2
‘ i explained @entity17 might have to go to heaven if @entity72 could n’t fix her			2
@entity1 understood , but i knew she ’d be utterly distraught			2
’ pioneering : the vet who operated on @entity17 hopes that many more dogs can benefit from the cutting edge new bionic leg of course , @entity1 ’s @entity165 wish came true and now @entity72 believes the procedure will be commonplace in the next decade or so			1
and @entity1 and @entity17 are happily getting on with their lives			1
‘ they have a special empathy , ’ says @entity69			1
‘ when @entity17 was tiny , @entity1 saw this helpless little creature and held her so gently			1
‘ @entity1 ’s eyes used to be so frightened — a symptom of her dementia			1
and tests have shown her condition is improving			0
’ she adds : ‘ the changes to her have been quite miraculous			0
and it ’s all thanks to one small dog			0
