more than a million people watched a video of a couple ' having sex ' on @entity5 's football pitch before it was revealed as a publicity stunt			1
the footage was uploaded to a @entity9 account yesterday afternoon and appeared to show a mystery couple in the middle of the club 's grounds - @entity14 - in south east @entity15			1
the clip was captioned by user @entity17 as ' someone broke into @entity14 ( home of @entity5 ) and did this in the centre circle ! # @entity21 '			1
the vine clip was taken from a longer video which has now been uploaded to @entity40 and purports to show several cctv angles of the excited couple sneaking into the ground			0
the video had already prompted debate after fans of @entity47 claimed it may have been from a deleted scene from the @entity51 crime drama			0
an episode of the crime series filmed at the stadium in january last year features a storyline about a footballer who was linked to a brutal murder of a young woman after a sex tape of him was leaked			2
@entity61 @entity60 posted on @entity62 : ' could the " @entity5 sex tape " actually be a scene from the tv show @entity47 ? ' while @entity66 wrote : ' did the @entity51 break a story that @entity5 are investigating a couple having sex on the centre spot ? was n't it filmed for one of their shows ? ' but a pr firm for @entity5 - whose officials initially announced they would carry out an investigation - now admit the video was a promotional tool			1
promotion : the video was all to grab attention for a scheme involving grassroots footballers not everyone saw the funny side			0
one fan of the club nicknamed the @entity90 fumed : ' we are the @entity90 - not the sex addicts ! ' it is not the first time a couple have sneaked onto a football pitch to share a moment of passion			1
in 2013 , after a @entity101 match between @entity102 and @entity103 , which ended goalless , an unknown couple sneaked onto the pitch and started having sex by the centre circle			0
@entity102 press officer @entity108 reported the incident on his @entity62 feed , and an image of the canoodling couple was then posted online			0
further reports have also indicated that the pair 's love making failed to last long as the couple were interrupted by the club 's security chief , @entity117 , who threw them out of the stadium			2
@entity123 international @entity120 and his wife @entity121 also had sex on the centre spot of his club 's @entity127 stadium			2
his national team later beat @entity130 2 - 0 there in a @entity133 qualifier			0
in an interview on a @entity137 tv chatshow to promote her book ' @entity140 ' , @entity134 revealed that the couple had even arranged for friends to leave the floodlights on at the @entity144 so they could see what they were doing			0
sneaking around : it also featured so - called cctv of the couple wandering around the ground at night officials at @entity5 , nicknamed the @entity90 , have announced they will be carrying out a full investigation			1

footage uploaded to @entity9 account yesterday has been seen by one million
it shows a couple allegedly having sex in middle of @entity14 stadium
man behind the account said it is genuine and was filmed on tuesday
but @entity5 has *hoodwinked* the internet - as it was to promote the club
