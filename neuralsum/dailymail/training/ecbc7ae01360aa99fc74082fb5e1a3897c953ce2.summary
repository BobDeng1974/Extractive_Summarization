by @entity1 reporter last updated at 1:39 pm on 22nd october 2011 republicans condemned president @entity4 's announcement that remaining @entity6 troops will withdraw from @entity7 by the end of the year			1
senator @entity9 said the president 's decision is a ' harmful ' setback for @entity6 interests in the @entity14			0
senator @entity9 said : ' i respectfully disagree with the president			0
this decision will be viewed as a strategic victory for our enemies in the @entity14 , especially the @entity23 regime , which has worked relentlessly to ensure a full withdrawal of @entity6 troops from @entity7			1
former @entity33 governor @entity32 said : ' president @entity4 's astonishing failure to secure an orderly transition in @entity7 has unnecessarily put at risk the victories that were won through the blood and sacrifice of thousands of @entity6 men and women			1
' concerns : senator @entity9 criticised @entity4 's decision to withdraw troops by the end of the year @entity45 said : ' whether or not it â€™s the right thing to do , i would consult with the commanders			1
' the thing i would n't do that the president is doing is telling the enemy how many troops you 're going to bring out and when you are going to bring them out			0
i do n't think that 's a good strategy			0
' @entity57 largely praised the decision as a promise @entity4 has kept from his pledges made while campaigning for the presidency			1
@entity63 minority leader @entity62 said the move honours ' the @entity6 - @entity65 and the wishes of the @entity6 people to bring all our troops home by the end this year '			1
president @entity4 made the announcement marking the end of one of the longest and most divisive conflicts in @entity6 history			1
' as promised , the rest of our troops in @entity7 will come home by the end of the year			1
after nearly nine years , @entity6 's war in @entity7 will be over , ' the president said			1
' the tide of war is receding			0
' ' the @entity6 is moving forward from a position of strength , ' he added			0
around 4,000 to 5,000 security contractors will remain in @entity7 , the @entity63 said			2
end of war : the announcement marks a major milestone after nine years of war @entity4 's statement put an end to months of wrangling over whether the @entity6 would maintain a force in @entity7 beyond 2011			1
the president spoke following a video conference with @entity7 prime minister @entity98 , the @entity63 said in a statement			0
mr @entity4 said the announcement marked a ' move into a new phase			2
' he vowed to work with the @entity7 government and said the two countries were ' in full agreement about how to move forward '			0
' as of january 1 it will be a normal relationship between sovereign nations , ' he said			0
' this will be a strong and enduring partnership ... that will unleash the potential of the @entity7 people			0
' but immediately following the announcement there were claims that the troops were bring withdrawn because the @entity7 government had refused to let them stay			0
the @entity116 reported that as recently as last week , the @entity63 was trying to persuade the @entity7 to allow between 2,000 and 3,000 stay beyond the end of the year			2
only about 150 soldiers will be stationed in @entity7 from next year who will protect the @entity120 in @entity121 and assist in arms sales			1
' we can say troops will definitely be home for the holidays , ' mr @entity4 said			2
@entity4 , an opponent of the war from the start , took office and accelerated the end of the conflict			2
in august 2010 , he declared the @entity6 combat mission over			0
' over the next two months our troops in @entity7 , tens of thousands of them , will pack up their gear and board convoys for the journey home , ' @entity4 said			1
' the last @entity6 soldier will cross the border out of @entity7 with their heads held high , proud of their success and knowing that the @entity6 people stand united in our support for our troops			2
' mr @entity4 said that he wanted to ' join @entity6 in paying tribute to those who have served ... and given their lives			2
' @entity149 : mr @entity4 said that all soldiers would be returning by the holidays the withdrawal of @entity6 troops marks a major milestone in the war that started in 2003 and resulted in the removal of @entity157 from power in @entity7			1
the two countries have been negotiating over whether the @entity6 would leave behind up to several thousand military trainers after year - end , or if all remaining troops would depart as planned by december 31			1
the main sticking point has been legal immunity for any @entity6 forces that remain			0
after ending combat operations in 2010 , the last 44,000 @entity6 troops are scheduled to leave @entity7 by the end of the year under the terms of a bilateral security pact			1
in recent months , @entity170 had been discussing with @entity7 leaders the possibility of several thousand @entity6 troops remaining to continue training @entity7 security forces			2
throughout the discussions , @entity7 leaders refused to give @entity6 troops immunity from prosecution in @entity7 courts , and the @entity6 refused to stay without that guarantee			2
reunited : after ending combat operations in 2010 , the last 44,000 @entity6 troops are scheduled to leave @entity7 by the end of the year partnership : the withdrawal of @entity6 troops marks a major milestone in the war that started in 2003 moreover , @entity7 's leadership has been split on whether it wanted @entity6 forces to stay			1
when the 2008 agreement requiring all @entity6 forces to leave @entity7 was passed , many @entity6 officials assumed it would inevitably be renegotiated so that @entity6 could stay longer			0
the @entity6 said repeatedly this year it would entertain an offer from the @entity7 to have a small force stay behind , and the @entity7 said they would like @entity6 military help			1
but as the year wore on and the number of @entity6 troops that @entity170 was suggesting could stay behind dropped , it became increasingly clear that a @entity6 troop presence was not a sure thing			0
the issue of legal protection for the @entity6 was the deal - breaker			0
pulling troops out by the end of this year allows both @entity98 and @entity4 to claim victory			0
promise : when the 2008 agreement requiring all @entity6 forces to leave @entity7 was passed , many officials assumed it would inevitably be renegotiated serving : more than 4,400 @entity6 military members have been killed since the @entity6 invaded @entity7 in march 2003 @entity4 kept a campaign promise to end the war , and @entity98 will have ended the @entity6 presence and restored @entity7 sovereignty			1
the president used the war statement to once again turn attention back to the economy , the domestic concern that is expected to determine whether he wins re-election next year			0
' after a decade of war the nation that we need to build and the nation that we will build is our own , an @entity6 that sees its economic strength restored just as we 've restored our leadership around the globe			0
' more than 4,400 @entity6 military members have been killed since the @entity6 invaded @entity7 in march 2003			1
a senior @entity63 official told @entity225 : ' this will allow us to say definitively that the @entity7 war is over			0

@entity57 commend @entity4 for a ' promise honoured '
brings the end of nine - year war that has seen 4,000 @entity6 soldiers killed
@entity4 heralds ' a move into a new phase ' as ' the tide of war is receding '
*39,000* @entity6 soldiers in @entity7 ' will definitely be home for the holidays '
*negligible* force of 150 to remain to protect *embassy* and assist arms sales
