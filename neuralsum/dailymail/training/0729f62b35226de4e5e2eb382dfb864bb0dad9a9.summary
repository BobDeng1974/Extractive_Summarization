by @entity0 and @entity1 last updated at 9:04 am on 20th july 2011 under pressure : @entity4 's prime minister @entity3 delivers a speech in @entity6 , @entity7 , today , before flying back to the @entity4 @entity3 was dragged deeper into the phone - hacking saga last night after it emerged that a key suspect gave media advice to his office in the run - up to the @entity14			1
ex-news of the @entity17 deputy editor @entity16 – arrested last week – acted as an informal adviser to mr @entity3 ’s former communications chief @entity19			1
@entity16 , nicknamed @entity20 during his @entity21 days , has already precipitated the downfall of @entity24 commander sir @entity23 and his deputy @entity25			2
sir @entity23 resigned on sunday after revelations that @entity16 had been employed by the @entity24 as a pr consultant			0
the following day @entity25 quit as assistant commissioner following a suspension over his relationship with @entity16 and his handling of the phone - hacking crisis			0
last night the @entity34 issued a statement confirming that mr @entity16 – mr @entity19 ’s deputy when he edited the paper – continued to advise him after he had started working for mr @entity3			1
a spokesman said : ‘ it has been drawn to our attention that he may have provided @entity19 with some informal advice on a voluntary basis before the election			1
‘ we can confirm that apart from @entity19 , neither @entity3 nor any senior member of the campaign team were aware of this until this week			1
’ the spokesman said that neither mr @entity16 nor his pr firm ‘ has ever been contracted by the @entity34 , nor has the @entity34 made payments to either of them ’			0
but the disclosure remains damaging for mr @entity3			0
he has repeatedly faced questions over his judgment in handing mr @entity19 a ‘ second chance ’ when he appointed him in 2007 , following his resignation from the @entity56			1
in a separate twist , it also emerged that one of @entity3 ’s most senior officials stopped @entity62 from briefing the prime minister on the phone - hacking scandal			0
the @entity65 appear before the @entity66 yesterday as @entity3 was last night dragged into the phone hacking row help : conservative party officials admitted that former spin doctor @entity19 , left , may have got help from @entity16 , right , before the last general election mps heard yesterday how @entity73 , mr @entity3 ’s chief of staff , rejected an offer by outgoing assistant commissioner @entity25 to talk to mr @entity3 after the @entity75 ran an article alleging that mr @entity19 ‘ actively encouraged ’ phone hacking while he was editor of the @entity56			1
mr @entity73 , an old school friend of mr @entity3 and one of his most trusted advisers , flatly rejected the offer on the grounds that it was ‘ inappropriate ’ and adding that he ‘ would be grateful if it were not raised please ’			0
sir @entity23 , pictured giving evidence to the @entity66 yesterday , resigned after it emerged he accepted a free stay at @entity86 - where @entity16 was a pr no 10 yesterday took the unusual step of releasing the email exchange between mr @entity25 and mr @entity73			0
@entity91 officials stressed that mr @entity73 had cleared his response with @entity91 permanent secretary @entity93			0
shadow home secretary @entity94 said : ‘ after the election [ mr @entity73 ] was given serious warnings about @entity19 , and in november he was offered information about police action on new allegations			2
‘ surely the prime minister needed to be told , especially as on both occasions it had serious implications for the prime minister ’s judgment in continuing to employ @entity19			2
