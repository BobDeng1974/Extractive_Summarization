a teenager with a rare condition which causes her to faint says she is sick of being accused of drunkenness when she passes out in public			1
@entity4 , 17 , suffers from a rare syndrome known as @entity6 ( @entity6 ) which causes her to faint if she stands up for longer than 30 minutes at a time			1
but , she says people often walk past her when she has fainted and assume she is a drunken teenager			1
@entity4 , 17 , has a rare condition which causes her to faint if she stands up for more than 30 minutes on one occasion , @entity4 , from @entity11 , even had to be rushed to hospital after being left unconscious for more than half an hour before anyone came to her rescue			1
she said : ‘ my condition has taught me that the public can be very naive			1
‘ if i faint in public people just ignore me because they think i ’m drunk - i was once left in town in the middle of winter for about half an hour			1
‘ even paramedics have told me that people are more likely to think i ’m wasted because i ’m a teenage girl			2
‘ it makes me very cautious if i go out alone , and sometimes i ’ll just have to sit on the floor for a few minutes if i think i ’m going to faint			2
‘ it can be quite annoying - the fact that people jump to the conclusion that i must be some kind of alcoholic			2
@entity4 says that when she faints in public people tend to assume she is drunk			1
once she had to be taken to hospital ( pictured ) after being left unconscious in the street in winter for 35 minutes before anyone helped her on another occasion ( pictured ) @entity4 had to be taken to hospital after fainting and falling down some stairs ‘ sometimes it can be hard , but i always try to remain positive			1
’ @entity4 is currently on medication to try and control her condition , but until a suitable treatment is found she has to learn to live with her symptoms			1
she said : ‘ if i go out and about , i just have to make sure i take time to sit down and have a rest - if i do n’t , i ’ll just collapse			0
‘ i ’m 6ft tall , so when i do faint i can really hurt myself on the way down , so i have to be really careful			0
@entity6 is an abnormal response by the nervous system to standing up			1
it causes an increase in heart rate and altered blood supply to the brain			0
this causes dizziness , fainting , tiredness and palpitations			0
other symptoms of @entity6 include shakiness , shortness of breath , chest pain , headaches and stomach problems			1
some patients find the condition very disabling while others have mild symptoms and get better without any treatment			2
the condition can be triggered by an illness , pregnancy , trauma and immunisations			2
it can also occur in teenagers who experience a sudden growth spurt			0
in some cases the condition results from another illness such as diabetes , ms or @entity80			2
source : pots @entity83 ‘ sometimes i will just sit on the floor if there is n’t a chair around - although i do n’t really like to as i can get pretty funny looks			0
‘ if i do n’t take the time to sit down i ’ll just faint and that ’s when it can be very difficult			0
‘ i wear a medical bracelet but people tend to just leave me			2
’ while @entity4 is always careful about condition , she has had some serious accidents in the past			1
she said : ‘ i was once at the top of the stairs and i fainted			0
‘ i fell all the way down and had to be rushed to hospital as they suspected i ’d fractured my neck			0
‘ although it was scary it taught me to take the condition seriously and be very careful			2
‘ before , i tried to beat it , but it taught me that i need to learn to live with it			0
’ @entity4 first began fainting five years ago at school			1
she said : ‘ it started when i was about 12 years old , and i just kept fainting every time i stood up			0
‘ it soon became everyday life , but i knew it was n’t normal so i went to the doctors			0
‘ at first they had no idea what it was and my symptoms were just dismissed			0
‘ by the time i was 16 they started to suggest that it was all psychological and i was putting it on and doing it for attention			0
‘ they were asking me if i got on with my mum , if i was stressed or there were any other problems in my life - it was very frustrating			0
‘ i did n’t want to see a psychologist so eventually i did some research myself and came across a charity called stars - they had loads of information about @entity6 and i realised that must be what i had			1
‘ i asked my doctors if they could refer me to a @entity6 clinic in @entity141 - that ’s where i finally got an official diagnosis last november			1
@entity4 has a condition which means her nervous system responds abnormally to standing up			1
she is pictured wearing a jacket made for her by her father ‘ it was a relief to know that i ’d been right along , but quite scary to discover that i had a medical condition			2
’ @entity6 is an abnormal response by the nervous system to standing up			1
it causes an increase in the heart rate and altered blood supply to the brain			0
this causes dizziness , fainting , tiredness and palpitations			0
other symptoms can include shakiness , shortness of breath , chest pain and headaches			0
@entity4 says that over time she has learned to manage her condition by sitting down regularly now , @entity4 does her best to live her life , despite her unusual condition			1
she said : ‘ i do n’t get really upset about my condition because there ’s nothing i can do about it			2
‘ i try to live my life as normal , i just have to have more breaks than other people			0
‘ i ’m lucky to have an incredible family and boyfriend who always look out for me and keep my spirits up			0
‘ i just want to tell my story so more people know about this			0
’ @entity182 , founder and ceo of stars , said : ‘ this case is a classic example of how hugely debilitating @entity6 can be			1
‘ common symptoms include a racing heart on standing up , palpitations , fainting , dizziness , chest pain and weakness			0
‘ there is a significant lack of awareness about @entity6 among both the public and the medical profession			1
‘ we often find the disorder is under - recognised by physicians , which can impact on the patient ’s quality of life through misdiagnosis or being informed symptoms are “ all in their head ”			0
‘ as a consequence , historically many patients with @entity6 have been given a diagnosis of me , anxiety or panic attacks			1
‘ despite the lack of awareness , the disorder is quite common			0
in young women , some estimates put the number of people with the condition higher than one in 100			1
‘ @entity225 stars our main aim is to raise awareness of @entity6 and other disorders which cause unexplained loss of consciousness			2
‘ @entity231 , from 2 - 8 june 2014 is our opportunity to focus on a broad range of disorders , like @entity6 , which affect a person ’s heart rhythm and can cause debilitating symptoms like @entity4 ’s			1
