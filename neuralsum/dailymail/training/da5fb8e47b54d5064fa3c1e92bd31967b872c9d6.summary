for two @entity2 flatmates , it all began as a fun project to recreate the iconic opening credits from their favourite television show , @entity6			1
they used pixel art , which mimics the distinctive style of retro arcade games , to pay tribute to the 26 - year - old credits which are known and loved in households across the globe			1
on february one @entity17 - based mates @entity15 and @entity18 uploaded their incredible ' @entity20 ' clip to @entity21 and were amazed when it went viral , receiving more than a million hits in the first two days			1
but the real shock came when just twelve hours after their upload an email landed in their inbox from the makers of @entity6 , requesting that they ring straight away			1
instead , it was an entirely genuine request for their fantastic appropriation to be used as the opening credits for the very next episode of the @entity6			1
it has been a whirlwind and a dream - come - true for the graphic designers			0
' we secretly hoped they would pick it up , but it all came so fast , ' @entity15 told @entity49			2
exactly two weeks after the clip was uploaded , it will be seen at the beginning of a new episode which is set to air in the @entity41 this sunday february 15 at 8pm			1
the flatmates called on visual artist @entity66 to recreate the notorious @entity68 theme song for their clip , perfectly pairing with their arcade game theme			2
the artists have paid meticulous attention to detail , recreating scenes like @entity75 and @entity76 driving @entity77 , mr @entity78 and @entity79 ( left to right ) are shown in the new pixelated - style at the @entity80 and although the artists admit they had a lot of fun creating the video , they had to pay meticulous detail to ensure they carried it off without a hitch			1
in each episode of @entity6 , the credits begin with prankster @entity91 writing a new phrase on the blackboard at @entity94			1
appropriately for the duo 's contribution , the digitised credits open with @entity91 scribbling ' pixel art is not art ' repeatedly during detention			0
the quirky trip through @entity94 shows the @entity80 , @entity102 , @entity103 and their home at @entity105 as never seen before			0
@entity91 skateboards through town as if in a @entity108 game , swerving through some familiar faces - and gaining 50 points when he bounces on barman @entity112 's head			0
the tribute video cleverly references some classic @entity6 moments for keen - eyed , die - hard fans			1
shop owner @entity116 scans baby @entity75 at the @entity102 just like in the original opening credits one of the most impressive moments of the clip is @entity76 's volumous hair flick at the supermarket these include @entity123 the elephant in a field ; poochy on a boardwalk ; @entity77 's barbershop quartet ' @entity128 ' on the pub roof and the tragic @entity130 with a halo			1
however , there are new details to be found on every replay			0
' @entity135 ' from @entity136 and a flying pig are both particularly well - hidden within the action			0
in another nod to the gaming culture the creators love so much , nerdy muso @entity139 plays the saxophone whilst the other students in the classroom stare down at their laps , distracted by their @entity148			0
as for the ending , the @entity139 's voice artist @entity149 put it best when he tweeted the clip with the caption : ' this gets kind of mind blowing at the end ! ' @entity15 and @entity157 are extremely talented and already have some amazing accomplishments to their name			1
the quirky trip through @entity94 shows the @entity80 , @entity103 and @entity105 ( pictured ) @entity18 works on graphics for games and did animation for episodes of @entity165 show @entity166			2
@entity15 was co-director on three of acclaimed @entity2 musician @entity168 's filmclips			0
he has created @entity169 , an animation studio			0
he is beginning to gain notoriety , as just two weeks ago one of @entity15 's clips was shared by @entity174 comedian @entity173 on his official @entity176 page to more than two million followers			2
the hilarious cartoon shows @entity173 ' character from ' @entity180 dancing manically using the same pixel art animation			0
as for @entity6 intro , there 's also an extra incentive for anyone who manages to identify all the cameos in the clip			2
' first person to name all the references wins a date with one of the hunks who made the @entity196 video , ' the pair joked			0
in another nod to the gaming culture the creators love so much , nerdy muso @entity139 plays the saxophone whilst the other students in the classroom stare down at their laps , distracted by their @entity148 as for the ending , the @entity139 's voice artist @entity149 put it best when he tweeted the clip with the caption : ' this gets kind of mind blowing at the end !
