the morning after the night before , and captain @entity0 had turned into @entity1			2
no hazy memories for @entity3 about what went on following @entity7 ’s marvellous @entity6 victory on sunday			1
‘ my wife gave me some of the best advice i ’ve ever had in my life after sinking the winning putt in 2002 , ’ said the @entity8			2
‘ do n’t drink too much or you ’ll forget about it			0
have a few drinks , of course , but remember these moments , they ’re special			0
and last night was special			0
’ and so he told us about the moment sir @entity22 came into the room and thanked the whole team for making him feel young again			1
‘ he said it had been like being back in the boiler room again and he thanked us for the pleasure , ’ said @entity3 , beaming			1
@entity29 took to @entity30 to show off his new @entity32 - themed outfit with @entity32 's @entity33 @entity34 and @entity35 pose with the @entity6 alongside @entity36 and @entity37 @entity38 , @entity39 and @entity40 enjoy a karaoke session after the victory @entity43 and @entity44 in red tartan kilts and wigs after @entity48 's loss against @entity7 in @entity6 he told of the conversation he was having with @entity50 and the fateful moment when , for the only time all night , he looked at the screen of his permanently buzzing smartphone			1
it was a text from @entity55 , friend of @entity50 and the man @entity3 had reluctantly left on the sidelines			1
‘ i do n’t want to break too many confidences but it was just very respectful to me , very respectful to the team and very regretful that he was n’t part of it , ’ he said			1
‘ it was just nice			0
it was a big , long text , and it meant a lot			0
’ @entity7 has been blessed with some wonderful captains over the years but @entity3 might just have been the best since @entity68			1
the respect his players had for him can be summed up by a lovely anecdote concerning @entity39			0
imagine what it must have been like for him when he was left out of the saturday afternoon foursomes matches , having just chipped in at the 15th during the morning , meaning he would play only three times ? ‘ it was a really tough call , but i just decided at the 11th hour to play @entity79 and break up that dynamic of @entity37 and @entity81 in the foursomes , ’ said @entity3			1
‘ the way @entity36 accepted that decision ... i mean he came out on the golf course in the afternoon , he put his arm around my shoulder and said : ‘ ‘ you ’re the captain , you make the calls and i ’ll be ready tomorrow ’ ’			1
that told me more about @entity39 than the banging on the heart or what he did at @entity96			0
’ the party began with just the team , caddies , sir @entity22 and other friends and wives			1
‘ it was n’t too packed and it was just nice with no one looking for selfies or autographs , ’ said @entity3			2
‘ a lot of the players then joined the @entity48 in their team room where we got our asses truly whipped at table tennis			1
i ’m certainly glad the @entity6 is not a table tennis championship ! then we went out into the bar and public areas			1
so we moved around , but we started out initially just being together , which was great			0
a little moment to savour			0
’ @entity3 , the victorious @entity7 @entity6 team captain , reads the @entity118 on monday morning @entity7 celebrate their @entity6 triumph over @entity48 which came to an end after singles matches on sunday @entity3 clutches the @entity6 trophy on monday morning after beating @entity48 on sunday @entity3 ’s attention to detail did n’t just extend to having the two @entity7 team room areas redecorated in blue and gold			1
he even had a fish tank put in , complete with blue and gold fish			1
‘ i just wanted everything in the team room to be the @entity7 colours and symbolise our coming together , and everyone bought into it , ’ he said			1
‘ that ’s what we do			0
we come from such diverse cultures and backgrounds but we stand together as one , from the bottom of @entity142 to the top of @entity144 , from the @entity145 of @entity146 right across to @entity147			0
and as for the fish , yeah , that was my idea			2
they ’re still swimming away happily although they might have hangovers as some of the wine might have been spilled over them			0
’ whoever takes over from @entity3 is going to have enormous shoes to fill but he confirmed he would not be standing again in any capacity , either as captain or vice-captain			1
‘ i feel like i made the natural progression from player to vice-captain to captain — and that will be it for me , ’ he said			2
@entity3 will , however , be part of the new selection process that will decide on his successor , who will be announced early in the new year			1
the new five - man committee comprises the last three captains , @entity171 , chief executive of the @entity173 , plus an as yet undetermined member of the @entity175			0
the choice is likely to come down between @entity177 and @entity40			0
@entity7 's @entity3 is sprayed with champagne as he holds the @entity6 trophy after beating @entity48 @entity7 's @entity38 put this photograph on @entity181 with the message : ' i have felt better ! ' @entity7 's @entity38 put this photograph on @entity181 with the message : ' i have felt better ! ' as for the future of the @entity6 , @entity3 has no fears people will lose interest with @entity7 winning so often			1
‘ everything is going in an upwards direction , from the viewing figures around the world to commercial revenue to general media interest , ’ he said			0
‘ then you ’ve got @entity48 pride			2
and then you ’ve got the fans			0
were n’t they amazing ? ‘ i feel such pride about this @entity6 , not on the inside but being able to look around and see people bursting with joy , the spectators high - fiving each other in the stands and everyone with a smile on their face			2
everyone is so wrapped up in it and loves it so much , i ca n’t see a single valid reason why it would decline			0
’ as for his own future , @entity3 is looking forward to playing free of distractions after two years when he has put his heart and soul into the captaincy			1
he might even play in the @entity222 links at @entity223 this week			0
‘ @entity224 knows what my swing would be like , ’ he said			0
but his @entity6 race is now run , and what a journey it was			2
three times a player , twice a vice-captain and finally a captain , with six victories to show from those six @entity234			2
@entity3 leaned forward and placed his hand against @entity237 ’s precious trophy			2
i ’ve been a lucky man , ’ he said			0
@entity39 is covered in champagne as the celebrations get going after @entity7 win the @entity240 @entity241 sticks his tongue out as he celebrates with his @entity244 teammates at the @entity6 @entity245 ( centre ) looks despondent after @entity7 collect the @entity6 trophy against @entity48 on sunday			1
