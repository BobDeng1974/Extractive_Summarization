so close : @entity0 , on the left , with her cousin and best friend @entity3 - who was in daily contact with @entity0 throughout the honeymoon the woman who holds the key to the secrets of @entity10 ’s turbulent relationship with her husband told police she believed he was lying about the sequence of events surrounding her murder			1
@entity17 , @entity0 ’s cousin and best friend , said she was suspicious of millionaire businessman @entity19 ’s claim that his bride wanted to visit a township in @entity22 late at night on their honeymoon			1
in a sensational witness statement , @entity3 – who was in daily contact with @entity0 throughout the honeymoon – insisted @entity0 thought the wedding was a sham and @entity10 was controlling and refused to have sex			1

@entity3 ’s testimony forms the mainstay of the prosecution case			0
in her statement , seen by @entity44 , @entity3 , 30 , claims that : a year apart in age , strikingly similar in looks , @entity0 and @entity3 , who last week flew to @entity39 where she will give evidence at the trial , grew up together and shared a flat at university			1
both were close to their siblings but the bond between the two women ran deeper than any other in their lives			0
‘ i knew absolutely everything , no matter how intimate or private , about @entity0 and she in turn knew absolutely everything about me , ’ said @entity3			1
‘ we shared things that no other person knew or knows about			0
’ denial : @entity19 in @entity39 's @entity64 earlier this week			0
@entity3 claims that he scolded his new bride for leaving clothes unfolded in their honeymoon suite while upset by @entity10 ’s personal criticisms , it was , claimed @entity3 , the lack of intimacy in their 18 - month relationship that troubled @entity0 most			1
‘ she told me she had tried to be intimate but @entity10 had pushed her away , ’ said @entity3			2
‘ @entity0 felt embarrassed and hurt by his reaction and we felt it was weird			0
’ two weeks later , while staying at @entity81 ’s @entity80 , he was similarly distant , leaving @entity0 and her cousin to conclude ‘ maybe he was a virgin ’ or being ‘ proper ’ and not wanting sex before marriage			1
@entity10 offered an explanation later			0
he said he was tired from ‘ hormone treatment for his infertility ’			2
this revelation , according to @entity3 , prompted @entity0 to break off the relationship ‘ because she wanted to have children in the future but also because she did not want to be pushed away from intimacy ’			2
following assurances from @entity10 that his treatment was now working , the couple got back together in january 2010			2
‘ in other words he could have children and that his now raised hormone levels would allow him to be intimate , ’ said @entity3			2
around this time @entity0 and @entity3 moved to @entity103 from their native @entity104 and shared a flat in @entity107 , @entity108			0
for a while @entity0 ’s relationship with @entity10 improved but it deteriorated after he ‘ travelled alone to @entity110 to complete a @entity110 boxing course which he claimed would raise his hormone level ’ apparently further			1
what neither @entity0 nor @entity3 suspected at this stage was that @entity19 ’s sexual interests often lay elsewhere			0
acting : @entity0 's cousin @entity3 claims that @entity0 told her that the couple were ‘ acting ’ all the way through their wedding ceremony , pictured above			1
she also claims @entity10 told his bride that her sari was not ' proper ' in a dramatic opening to his long - awaited trial , @entity10 pleaded his innocence but revealed he is bisexual and saw male prostitutes			1
it was designed to pre-empt the forthcoming appearance of @entity132 , a male prostitute who claims @entity10 paid him £ 400 a session for sex			2
in court he came face to face with the man he allegedly hired to murder his wife for the first time since the night of the shooting			0
@entity143 , 29 , is one of two prosecution witnesses who have claimed that @entity10 paid them to kill @entity0			2
@entity10 denied any involvement in the murder of his 28 - year - old wife , who died from a gunshot wound to the neck in a rough township of @entity39 in november 2010			1
and he said , despite visiting male prostitutes , he was still attracted to @entity0 and had no reason to kill her			0
throughout the spring and summer of 2010 their relationship , according to @entity3 ’s statement , was characterised by arguments			0
‘ during this time @entity0 told me through daily text messages , telephone calls and emails that she was not comfortable with @entity10 , ’ said @entity3			1
and in may that year , she claims , @entity0 was effectively ambushed into an engagement			2
the statement says : ‘ @entity0 ’s parents came to the @entity103 for a visit with the intention of @entity0 introducing them to @entity10 ’s family			1
’ the families met and ‘ the following morning @entity10 ’s sister - in - law @entity170 came down the stairs holding a silver tray with a holy relic to bless the relationship			1
this came as a complete surprise to @entity0 , her parents and me because @entity0 ’s parents explained that this blessing is a sign of an engagement which they were not expecting			0
’ according to @entity3 , her cousin was ‘ aware that she had about a week ’ before the engagement was due to be officially announced on may 27			0
two days before , she sent @entity10 an email , which @entity3 helped compose , calling off the engagement			0
but @entity10 urged her to reconsider , professed his love and ‘ promised to change his ways ’			2
in the statement , @entity3 said @entity10 ‘ was always very controlling and very critical of @entity0 ’s appearance ’			1
once he called @entity3 to ask her to help him buy clothes for @entity0 ‘ because he wanted to change , as he said , “ the ugly duckling into a swan before the engagement ”			1
’ further emails from july 2010 describe more doubts , yet the wedding preparations continued apace			0
@entity3 said : ‘ during this time @entity0 sent me disturbing text messages explaining that there was a huge amount of animosity between them			0
’ shooting : @entity208 witness @entity143 covers his face with his jacket as he sits in the dock in court in 2012 it resulted , said the statement , in @entity0 ‘ throwing her engagement ring at @entity216 ... @entity0 explained her sadness at the fact they were fighting all the time and not sharing a bed ... as he chose to sleep on the sofa			1
’ but once again , they got back together , and the wedding , due to last two days , was set for october 27			0
‘ after the first ceremony , @entity0 returned to our hotel room and i noticed she was upset , ’ said @entity3			2
‘ i asked what was bothering her			0
she replied by asking me if i thought she looked beautiful because ... @entity10 ’s first words to @entity0 as she approached him on the red carpet was “ your sari is not proper ”			1
’ later , while helping @entity0 with her make - up , @entity3 says her cousin asked ‘ if we looked in love ’			1
@entity3 goes on : ‘ i then asked , “ why would you ask me that ? ” and @entity0 replied that she and @entity10 had agreed to “ act out the rest of the wedding ceremonies ”			1
’ doubts : within days of the wedding @entity0 was talking again of leaving @entity10 ‘ and asked me to help her ’ , claimed @entity3 within days of the wedding @entity0 was talking again of leaving @entity10 ‘ and asked me to help her ’ , claimed @entity3			1
then @entity0 found out she was going to @entity22 on honeymoon			0
@entity3 said : ‘ @entity0 was calling me on a daily basis explaining she did not want to go anywhere with @entity10 , to @entity22 or anywhere else , as she wanted a divorce			1
‘ ... she also said they were not legally married as they had not had the registry marriage in the @entity103			0
’ the last time @entity3 saw her cousin was on november 7 ‘ when @entity0 , @entity10 and others met up and went out to dinner so that i could introduce them to my boyfriend			1
the mood was very tense as @entity10 was criticising @entity0 about her hair colour			0
’ the following day they left on honeymoon and five days later @entity3 was told her cousin had been murdered			2
‘ @entity10 called me , crying , as i was , so i ca n’t really remember much about this call			0
