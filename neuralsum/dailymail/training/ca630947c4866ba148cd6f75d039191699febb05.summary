by @entity1 reporter published : 09:36 est , 9 april 2013 updated : 11:05 est , 9 april 2013 four top @entity3 bosses have been awarded bonuses totalling more than £ 600,000			1
@entity3 , who run the railway tracks , receive £ 4billion in public funding each year			1
the news will infuriate commuters and train travellers facing huge hikes in rail fares for an ' inadequate service ' , in which trains are often overcrowded and more than 40 per cent do not arrive on time			2
bonus : four top @entity3 bosses have been awarded bonuses totalling more than £ 600,000 the long - term incentive plan payments , including £ 168,000 to finance director @entity19 , come at a time when rail regulators have been critical of @entity3 's performance on the railways			1
under the plan , network operations managing director @entity25 and infrastructure projects managing director @entity24 both get £ 158,400 , while group strategy director @entity29 picks up £ 148,400			2
the payments , reflecting the company 's performance in the period 2009 - 12 , could have been higher but @entity33 said 20 per cent had been cut ' to take account of specific safety and train performance issues			0
' @entity37 , passenger director at @entity38 , said : ' passengers are not interested in salaries and bonuses given to industry figures			2
what is important to them is that they can rely on their service to get them in on time , and that their ticket is good value for money			0
it 's up to @entity3 to justify performance - related bonuses by working with operators to deliver an on - time railway and to continue to drive down the costs of this			1
' top bosses : the long - term incentive plan payments , including £ 168,000 to finance director @entity19			1
right , and £ 158,400 to network operations managing director @entity25 @entity3 executives are some of the highest paid in the public sector , as the head of its remuneration committee admitted at a meeting in december			1
but non-executive director @entity67 stressed that they remain in the ' lower quartile ' of private sector organisations , and the company needs to be able to attract and retain top employees			2
the news comes after @entity3 bosses gave up their bonuses last year , amid pressure to reduce high payouts at a time of public sector austerity			1
punctuality : the blue line shows what proportion of trains arrive on time month - by - month ; the red line shows a moving annual average ; and the green line shows the trains arriving within one minute of schedule ( i.e. not precisely on time ) @entity3 also said that the payments would be phased , with 60 per cent paid now and the balance to be reviewed at the end of the 2013/14 financial year			1
the company added that the award had been delayed by a year			2
claims : @entity3 chairman @entity96 said : ' the railway today is considerably more efficient than in 2009 ' the @entity98 ( @entity98 ) has repeatedly expressed dissatisfaction with @entity3 's performance , particularly on long - distance routes			1
of late there have been a series of overhead line problems that have caused serious delays on some busy routes , including the @entity108 main line where trains - on - time figures have fallen			0
@entity3 said today that under the terms of the 2009 long - term incentive plan ( @entity114 ) , the four directors had qualified for a 100 per cent payout			1
however , the company ’s remuneration committee had decided to reduce the award by 20 per cent			0
of this figure , 10 per cent reflected ' workforce safety , level crossing safety and enforcement notices over the period ' while the other 10 per cent took into account the fact that train performance targets were not met			0
@entity3 pointed out that during the period 2009 - 12 it had the cut the cost of running the railway by £ 1.6 billion and achieved £ 526 million in incremental savings above the @entity98 ’s original target			1
the number of passengers arriving on time had risen 13 per cent and projects worth £ 12 billion had been completed			1
@entity3 chairman @entity96 said : ' the railway today is considerably more efficient , carries more passengers and freight , and is in a much better state than it was in 2009			1
' taxpayers have benefited from very significant savings , with a further £ 526 million saved over and above our tough targets			0
passengers have benefited not just from more trains , but also more of those trains arriving on time			0
and we have made real progress in renewing our @entity149 legacy			0
' he went on : ' not everything has been perfect - and the 20 per cent reduction we have made reflects that			0
but it would be flying in the face of reality not to acknowledge the real progress @entity3 has made in this period , and these payments reflect and recognise that success			1
' @entity3 's chief executive sir @entity161 was not eligible for any @entity114 bonus as he was not with the company in 2009			1
@entity3 which is responsible for track , signalling and some stations , is a not - for - dividend company			1
last year transport secretary @entity166 ratcheted up the pressure saying she would attend the rail giants annual members ' meeting in an attempt to shame directors into abandoning plans for hefty payouts it is effectively a public company in that it has no shareholders and its debt is guaranteed by the government			2
as of march 31 2012 sir @entity37 was on an annual basic salary of £ 560,000 while mr @entity19 was on £ 382,000			0
mr @entity25 and mr @entity24 were both on £ 360,000			0
@entity182 , leader of the @entity184 rail union , said : ' this is rewarding failure on a grand scale			0
for the second year running , nr have missed their punctuality targets and still awarded themselves massive long - term bonuses			0
' the timing looks like @entity192 ( former number 10 press secretary and now @entity3 head of @entity195 ) has lost little of his ability to try to bury bad news			2
he has used the arrangements for mrs @entity200 's funeral as a cover to try to avoid passenger outrage			0
' as passengers faced a 4.2 % fare increase in january , they will be puzzled why the people who can not make their trains on time are rewarding themselves with taxpayers ' money			2
this is yet another @entity212			0
' in february 2012 the @entity3 directors rejected bonus payments worth up to £ 20million and instead offered the money to be spent on safety improvements			1
the decision was taken after they faced growing pressure to turn down the payouts in the wake of the row over bonuses for banking staff			0
each of the six board members was entitled to receive up to 60 per cent of their annual salary as a bonus - which could have amounted to £ 1.39million			2
over the next three years the total bonus package they could have received would have been £ 20million			0
last year transport secretary @entity166 ratcheted up the pressure by saying she would take the unprecedented step of attending the rail giant ’s annual ‘ members ’ meeting ’ in an attempt to shame directors into abandoning plans for hefty payouts .			0
