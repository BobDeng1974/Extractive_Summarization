@entity0 worked at a major bank in @entity2			1
she has now written a book about her exploits with a controlling married man under a nom de plume a multi-millionaire businessman starts a controlling love affair with a woman several years his junior , flying her away to expensive destinations and picking out beautiful clothes for her to wear			1
but with the perks come the demands in the bedroom , the requests to indulge in sexual activities that would otherwise have gone unexperienced			2
it 's a story that we are well - versed in now ; @entity20 meets @entity20 and the wide - eyed young woman starts an exciting romance with a successful but dangerous businessman			2
but this is n't @entity20			2
this is the real - life story of a woman from @entity2 using the nom de plume @entity0			1
@entity0 is a beautiful young city worker who was sucked into a controlling affair with a high - flying , highly - sexed banking executive who dictated how she looked and behaved			1
the only big difference between this story and @entity33 's fictional account is that @entity0 ’s mr @entity34 was married			1
but while @entity35 ended up marrying her lover , @entity0 gave up her well - paid job and left the profession after her partner 's controlling behaviour proved too much			1
much like @entity35 , @entity0 was a young woman swayed by the power and success of her partner , who we will call @entity45			1
he was a big - shot in the world of banking , where excess and bravado were key players , and the power was intoxicating			2
@entity45 was one of the senior executives at the company ; he had a reputation as a ladies ' man , a top floor office and an expense account that ran into hundreds of thousands			1
@entity0 and @entity45 ( fake name ) had a romance was very similar to the relationship between @entity20 and @entity20 in @entity20 ( pictured ) @entity0 was n’t alone in falling for @entity45 – in the @entity73 environment , the heady mix of long hours , big money and office intimidation often leads to affairs			1
she told @entity76 : ' @entity77 was rife			2
i do n't know if the wives at home knew of it or were just blissfully unaware			2
' i 'd go out with men from the office to a bar and see them slipping their wedding ring in their pocket as they walked inside			2
' it was almost like an unspoken law in some ways			2
there were the high - rolling men who would buy @entity92 for a certain set of women , knowing that was enough to guarantee them something at the end of the night			1
' or they would fly an assistant or administrator away with them on a business trip with expectation that although they had a wife at home , they would be the girlfriend for a week			2
' when an all - expenses - paid trip to @entity108 presents itself to someone who has never been first class or slept in five - star hotels , they do get swayed by it			0
' @entity0 worked in finance in the back office of one of the @entity57 's biggest banks , where high - rolling traders spent tens of thousands of pounds on lavish meals ( picture posed by models ) it was at one of these alcohol - fuelled meetings in a bar near work that @entity0 first fell for the charms of senior executive @entity45			1
a low - maintenance girl from the countryside , @entity0 had never imagined she would be one of the women easily bought with expensive @entity92 and material gifts			1
she said : ' i always thought that he was one of those old charmers - he spoke very well and was had a reputation as a ladies ' man			1
' but it was n't until we were in drinking situations that he made it clear he wanted to take me out to dinner			0
' i was very resistant initially because i knew where it was going to lead , but i eventually just got won over by expensive gifts and amazing holidays			1
' i do have my head screwed on and i wanted to pursue a career and settle down , but my head got turned			0
' @entity45 convinced @entity0 to have dinner with him and the romance escalated from there ( posed by models ) soon , @entity0 was being whisked away on countless five - star holidays , from a @entity155 shopping weekend in @entity108 , to break in @entity156 , @entity157 or the @entity158			1
she said : ' he knew my dress and shoe size and my closet and shoe cabinet is all the better for it			0
' we would go and buy six or eight dresses from @entity166 , @entity167 , or wherever it was			0
' he was very up on style , so he already had an idea in his head that he wanted me in a short cocktail dress or something body - hugging or whatever			0
' it was amazing , because we would go and spend a weekend in @entity108 and i would come away with these pretty dresses and matching shoes			0
' soon , @entity0 was being whisked away on five - star holidays			1
he would also treat her to expensive jewellery and designer clothes ( picture posed by models ) but the expensive luxury masked a more sinister side to @entity45 's personality			1
soon , he was dictating the way that @entity0 dressed , how she wore her hair , even the shade of nail polish			1
she said : ' he was very controlling			2
' there was an expectation that i was dressed a certain way and that my hair and nails were done and that i was well presented			2
' once , i went to the nail salon at work and i came back with a @entity199 manicure			2
' he said to me , " i told you to get red "			0
' i just looked at him and thought , this makes no odds and i do n't know why we 're arguing about the colour of my nails , it was just a point to prove there was control there			0
' the heady mix of long hours , big money and office intimidation in the @entity73 inevitably leads to office affairs the control also reached into their sex lives , with @entity45 pressurising @entity0 into sordid sex games			1
she said : ' the guy that i was with was incredibly highly sexed and there was an attempt to groom me into participating in swingers ' parties and that sort of thing			0
' he had a real reputation among the women in the company for his sexual nature			0
' i would n't be surprised if he had been sleeping with other people from the business while we were together and even prostitutes			0
' @entity0 's view of her partner and the business they worked in only started to break down completely when the financial crisis fully took hold			1
as members of the public struggled to keep their jobs and homes as a result of the recession , many @entity73 workers were still spending with reckless abandon , including @entity45 , who thought nothing of splashing thousands of pounds of the company ’s money on fancy weekends away			0
the expensive luxury masked a more sinister side to @entity45 's personality			2
much like @entity20 in @entity20 ( pictured ) , he tried to coerce @entity0 into sex games she said : ' you either stay and are complicit or you fully take yourself out of it and i decided to take myself out of it - both the job and the relationship			1
' putting an end to the romance was easier said than done though and @entity45 refused to accept their affair was over			2
@entity0 eventually had to quit her job and move counties , changing phone numbers and emails to escape his constant messages			1
@entity272 by @entity0 is out now she said : ' it proved to be difficult for a good 18 months afterwards			1
' he could n't handle that he was n't in control of this situation - he always had to be in control			0
' but after leaving the industry and blocking his access , she finally was free two years after ending it			0
she has since decided to write a book , out now , based on her experiences			0
@entity0 hopes it will serve as a warning to young women who are considering getting involved in a relationship with a married man			1
but she also wants the tale to serve as an anchor for @entity73 workers who have started to become lost in the excess and greed			0
she said : ' the book is basically a high flyer 's diary			0
' it really is an insight into banking , the greed and extravagance , but with names changed so that people ca n't be identified			0
' but i hope it will ring some bells for anyone who finds themselves in the same position			0
' @entity272 by @entity0 is out now published by @entity310			1
pay packets and tax - dodging : @entity0 : ' i worked in finance and had access to a lot of financial data , so i could see what the bank was paying employees - we 're talking about people who would win the lottery every year and then some			1
' i would always wonder why these people were coming back to work after they 've just been given seven - figure bonuses - people were being paid tens of millions in one year alone			0
' there was also a handful of people who got paid in tax effective schemes to maximise their net take home , they were domiciled in various countries like @entity333 or @entity334 , where the tax rates are low or non-existent			0
' so these people were being rewarded for what they brought to the bank but also what they took home was the majority of it			0
' expenses : @entity0 : ' they would put business dinners on expenses where the food was often thrown in for free because they had spent so much money on the alcohol			1
' i saw one case where people ended up getting disciplined after spending £ 40,000 on a single meal for six people			0
' expenses were used on personal trips away , on things that definitely had no purpose for the business , and there was a very high emphasis placed on extravagance and glamour			0
' bullying : the more senior staff took pride in shaming newer recruits , seeing how long they took to break			0
@entity0 said : ' one of the senior management used to come into our department where he would trawl the floor , lifting the ties of different men to see what brand they were wearing			1
' he was carrying a pair of scissors and if he did n't like the brand he saw , he would snip the tie off just under the tie knot			0
' then he would tell them to go shop in @entity381 or somewhere similar and not in @entity382 or @entity383			0
