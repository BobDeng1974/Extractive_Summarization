by @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 published : 18:25 est , 27 april 2013 updated : 18:38 est , 27 april 2013 @entity5 's election guru believes that @entity7 chairman @entity6 and chancellor @entity8 are ‘ liabilities ’ who will cost the party votes in this week ’s crucial town hall polls , it was claimed last night			1
tough - talking @entity13 has had a series of clashes with fellow campaign chiefs @entity6 and @entity8 , according to insiders			1
they say that @entity19 - born mr @entity13 , recruited by mr @entity5 to revive flagging @entity7 ratings , regards mr @entity6 as ‘ ineffective ’			1
and he reportedly believes mr @entity8 ’s abysmal personal popularity means he is driving voters away in large numbers			1
' liability ' : chancellor @entity8 has been criticised by @entity5 's election guru , nicknamed the ' @entity26 ' the divisions in the @entity7 high command emerged amid reports that rebel conservative mps may use big losses in thursday ’s town hall elections to launch a fresh assault on mr @entity5 ’s leadership			1
mr @entity13 last night strongly denied criticising mr @entity6 and mr @entity8 saying : ‘ it is not true			1
they are doing a splendid job			0
’ in a separate development a @entity7 mp warned the prime minister he faces losing out to the @entity40 in the polls			1
@entity43 mp @entity42 urged mr @entity5 to use the last few days of campaigning to pledge a tougher stance on @entity46 – or see @entity48 leader @entity47 make big gains			2
the @entity7 drive to halt the @entity48 bandwagon has been hit by tensions between new arrival mr @entity13 and mr @entity6 and mr @entity8			1
one official said : ‘ @entity13 can not see the point of @entity6			1
he does n’t think he has much to offer by way of campaign skills or as an effective frontman for the party			0
’ tough talking : @entity19 election campaigner @entity13 has been hired by @entity5 to lead his election campaign mr @entity13 is also said to have had a number of heated exchanges with mr @entity8 about tactics			1
‘ @entity8 loves to show off his encyclopaedic knowledge of elections , arguing that this or that tactic was proved to be a disaster in an election campaign in @entity70 in days gone by , ’ said a source			1
‘ until now , no one has challenged him but @entity13 knows as much about elections as @entity8 and will tell him he is wrong – and why			1
@entity8 does n’t like it			1
’ mr @entity13 was dubbed ‘ the @entity76 ’ after being credited with helping @entity19 prime minister @entity74 win four elections			1
however , he is a controversial figure			0
he invented ‘ dog whistle politics ’ – so - called because it is too high for the human ear and can be used to send hidden messages to voters – which focus on cracking down on immigration , welfare and crime			0
in december , @entity87 revealed that as a then adviser to @entity90 mayor @entity89 , he used the phrase ‘ f * * * * * * @entity92 ’ in a diatribe about winning ethnic minority votes			0
with fears the @entity95 may haemorrhage votes to @entity48 , right - winger mr @entity42 urged mr @entity5 to ‘ beef up ’ his pledge to hold a referendum on @entity102 ’s membership of the @entity103 if the @entity95 win the general election , due in 2015			1
mr @entity42 said the prime minister should make an immediate commitment to introduce legislation on a referendum before the @entity104			0
it was the best way to counter @entity48 claims that he was not fully committed to a referendum – and would spike @entity48 ’s guns			2
mr @entity42 called on the prime minister to heed the calls already made by more than 100 fellow @entity7 mps			2
he said : ‘ we have to prove we are serious in our commitment for an @entity103 referendum			0
that ’s why we must bring forward legislation in this @entity119 regarding the referendum in the next			2
if we did that , it would beg the question : why would anyone bother to vote for @entity48 ? ' ineffective ' : @entity7 chairman @entity6 has not impressed @entity13 ‘ it would certainly help as i suspect @entity48 are going to do well			1
’ @entity7 strategists are attempting to ‘ manage expectations ’ by predicting the @entity7 will lose 300 of the 2,400 local authority seats being contested			2
the prime minister ’s aides are pessimistic because the seats were last fought in 2009 when @entity134 ’s government was at rock - bottom			2
now it is mr @entity5 suffering from a mid-term fall in support , with polls putting the @entity95 eight points behind @entity141			0
critically , @entity48 , which is consistently running at double figures in the polls , is fielding 1,734 candidates – up from 560 last time			0
although @entity48 is not expected to win a large number of seats , by appealing to @entity7 voters on issues such as pulling out of the @entity103 and opposing @entity151 development , the party could deprive the conservatives of victory in dozens of @entity154 the seats being contested , 1,477 are held by the @entity7 , 255 by @entity141 , 480 by @entity156 and 197 by other parties			2
if mr @entity5 manages to hold on to 1,200 seats – pegging losses to fewer than 300 – he will present it as a vindication of his leadership strategy			2
but if he loses more than 350 seats , his backbenchers will become restive			0
more than 500 would be regarded as a disaster			0
@entity166 will need to add at least 350 seats to present the poll to his backbenchers as a success			0
@entity169 ’s @entity156 are steeled for the loss of up to 100 seats			2
@entity48 ’s difficulty will be converting votes into seats : in 2009 , despite averaging a vote of 16 per cent in the areas where its candidates stood , they secured just eight seats			0
as most of the seats are being fought in southern @entity182 , where the main battle is between the @entity95 and the @entity156 , mr @entity47 could siphon votes away from both parties without adding significantly to his haul			0
commentators expect @entity48 ’s total gain to be in the ‘ high teens ’ , while claiming 50 seats or more would be classed as a ‘ wow ’ result			0
election expert @entity192 , professor of politics at @entity194 , said : ‘ some @entity7 losses are inevitable			1
the seats up for grabs were last contested four years ago during the darkest days of @entity134 ’s premiership			0
‘ what will be crucial for mr @entity5 is the scale of the losses			0
he would love the figure to be less than 300			0
that would mean he has hung on to some of the gains his party made in 2009			0
’ yesterday @entity207 , the @entity7 mp appointed as one of mr @entity5 ’s new policy advisers , warned against a shift to the @entity212 to meet the @entity48 challenge .			1
