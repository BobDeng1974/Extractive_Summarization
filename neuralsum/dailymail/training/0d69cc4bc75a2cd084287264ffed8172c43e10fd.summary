by @entity0 sat - navs are great for navigating unfamiliar cities and wildernesses , but it can be difficult for drivers to focus on the road when they are trying to read directions on a sat - nav device at the same time			0
now , however , an @entity10 app claims to make using a gps device safer while driving			2
the program uses a smartphone as a projection device to beam the projections from its app onto a car 's windscreen so that drivers no longer have to look down while they drive			0
it also shows the next upcoming sharp turn and the car 's speed , in a bid to make driving in severe weather conditions and at night , safer , as driver so not have to look down at a sat - nav the app uses @entity33 for its location information			1
once the free app is downloaded , @entity10 users can make a route on a map , which the app pre-loads so the map can be used without an internet connection			1
the @entity10 is placed on a car 's dashboard and secured the app beams driving directions , a car 's speed and turning alerts onto the car 's windscreen , which refelects the driving directions off the glass			2
this means the driver does not need to look down while he or she is in control of the vehicle			0
the @entity58 company said the app is ' a unique application for the smartphone that allows drivers to focus on the road , keep hands on the wheel and mind on driving			0
' the @entity22 app adds an augmented reality element to the windscreen without users having to spend a penny , as the app is free and no special glass coverings for the car are needed			1
to use the app , a user simply needs to place their phone on the dashboard and secure it in some way , enabling the app to beam a visual of the road onto the windscreen along with their speed and distance until the next potentially dangerous turn			2
the free @entity10 app taps into @entity33 to get its location information			1
it allows users to pre-load routes before they embark on their journey so the @entity22 app does not need to be constantly connected to the internet			0
app users can also save and share their routes sharp turns are highlighted in red and road markers are displayed every 50 metres to help drivers measure the distance before the next big turn , which is designed to be particularly useful in severe fog or at night , when visibility can be restricted in dimly lit areas			1
while images show the app in use in snowy and drizzly conditions , some experts question whether the screen from the @entity10 is strong enough to project light onto the windscreen in bright daytime conditions			2
critically , the @entity58 start - up says that an internet connection is not required for the duration of a car journey as users can set up a route on the app and pre-load a map from @entity33 before they embark on their journey			0
the @entity22 app adds an augmented reality element to the windscreen without users having to spend a penny , as the app is free and no special glass coverings are needed the company said : ' current navigation systems are inherently unsafe			1
they distract driverâ € ™ s attention away from the road			0
especially it 's not safe in low visibility conditions - rain , fog , heavy snow , night or just dark			0
' the firm has developed the app in a bid to reduce accidents as a result of poor weather conditions			1
according to the @entity146 , 350 people die every day across the globe as a result of low visibility conditions on the road			0
the @entity22 app also allows users to save routes and share them with friends and an @entity156 version is scheduled for february 2014 , @entity151 reported .			1

the app puts augmented reality details on the windscreeen , *including* driving instructions , speed and distance until sharp turns
it is designed for driving at night and in impaired weather conditions where visibility is *imperfect* in a bid to cut *traffic* accidents
the app is free for @entity10 users and a version for @entity156 handsets is expected in february
