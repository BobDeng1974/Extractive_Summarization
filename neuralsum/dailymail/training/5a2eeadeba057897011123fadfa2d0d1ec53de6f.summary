the first confirmed case of a human contracting a brain - eating amoeba though tap water has been revealed in a medical journal			2
an unnamed four - year - old boy from @entity6 picked up the deadly @entity7 while playing on a homemade water slide			1
he died two weeks later from a condition that the amoeba triggered called primary amebic meningoencephalitis ( @entity12 )			1
a four - year - old boy 's death is the first case of brain - eating amoeba - @entity16 fowleri - in tap water			1
the organisms trigger an infection called primary amebic meningoencephalitis ( @entity12 ) whch attacks brain cells			1
a stock image of the infection , which was studied under a microscope and stained , is shown previous victims of the organism have been infected after swimming in warm , freshwater lakes and rivers			0
@entity12 is almost universally fatal and is triggered by water containing the amoeba entering the nose during swimming , according to the study by researchers from the @entity34			1
@entity35 travels to the brain via the olfactory nerve and passes through a porous bone between the sinuses and the brain , where it breaks down nerve cells			1
this causes the brain to swell , causing symptoms including vomiting , delirium and seizures			1
primary @entity50 meningoencephalitis ( @entity12 ) is a rare disease of the central nervous system , caused by a waterborne amoeba - naegleria fowleri			2
this stained microscope image shows brain tissue with the free living parasite in it ( dark purple ) primary amoebic meningoencephalitis ( @entity12 ) is a rare disease of the central nervous system , caused by a waterborne amoeba - naegleria fowleri			2
the amoeba enters the nose and travels up the olfactory nerve ( shown as spidery legs in image ) the microorganism typically lives in warm , stagnant bodies of freshwater			0
it enters the central nervous system by attaching itself to the olfactory nerve after water is taken through the nose			0
it then migrates through porous bone and into the olfactory bulbs of the brain , where it multiplies by feeding on nerve tissue			0
between three and seven days after infection , people exhibit symptoms such losing their sense of smell and taste , because the nerve cells of the olfactory bulbs are eaten			1
after this , the infection spreads to the rest of the brain , resulting in headaches , nausea and rigidity of the neck muscles , progressing to vomiting , delirium , seizures , and eventually irreversible coma			2
people typically die two weeks after contact with the amoeba due to respiratory failure , when the infection spreads to the brain stem , destroying the nerve cells of the medulla oblongata , which controls the functions of breathing , heart rate and blood pressure			1
the boy in @entity6 ( not pictured ) picked up @entity16 fowleri while playing on a homemade water slide , like this one ( stock image ) the unnamed boy was taken to a @entity6 hospital in july 2013 , nine days after playing on the slide			1
he had a @entity117 ( 104 ° f ) fever , severe headache and bouts of vomiting , as well as staring straight ahead without responding for a few seconds at a time			0
at first , doctors thought he may have had meningitis , but a ct scan , spinal tap and other tests failed to identify the infection , which could not be treated with antibiotics			1
five days after being admitted to hospital , the boy suffered seizures before being declared brain dead			2
his family made the heart - breaking decision to take him off life support five days later , @entity135 reported			0
it was only after testing brain specimens that experts pinpointed the cause of death as being down to the amoeba which triggered @entity12			0
‘ this case is the first reported @entity12 death associated with culturable n. fowleri in tap water from a @entity151 treated drinking water system , ’ the study says			2
water samples collected from the home and the water distribution system that provided the tap water for the water slide , were tested and @entity158 fowleri identified in both samples			1
others have died as a result of ingesting @entity35 in contaminated water after @entity163 , as well as in other states			0
the microorganism is usually harmless and only infects the brain if it journeys through the nasal passages			0
the state of @entity6 has ramped up efforts to test water supplies for the amoeba , as well as advising that more chlorine be added during water treating , @entity168 reported			0
and a microbiologist is investigating how the amoeba becomes infectious and why some people seem to be more susceptible to it than others			0
the reports was published in the journal @entity181 .			0

boy is thought to have picked up @entity16 fowleri playing on a water slide
he died two weeks later from an infection known as @entity12
infection was *n't* *detected* in hospital , despite tests including a ct scan
@entity194 travels up the nose and breaks down nerve cells in the brain
symptoms include brain swelling , vomiting , fever and seizures
