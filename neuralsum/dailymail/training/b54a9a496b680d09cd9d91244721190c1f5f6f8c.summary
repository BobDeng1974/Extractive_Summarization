in a move that will alarm consumers , however , the @entity10 has decided to keep the name of the farm and the retailers it supplies a secret			1

turkeys on a farm in @entity8 have tested positive for food poisoning bug mrsa but the government 's food and farming department has refused to say which on or who they supply ( file picture ) @entity10 said its @entity32 had found @entity33 ( @entity3 ) in poultry during a routine inspection on the farm in @entity8			1
this is not the same form of the bacteria that cause illness in people , and usually clears within 24 hours			0
officials said the most likely reaction if it affected humans would be a skin rash , similar to eczema , rather than the stomach problems associated with food - poisoning bugs			0
@entity10 said that once the turkeys had been slaughtered and sold , the farm owner would disinfect barns			1
however , the fact that the department has decided to keep details of the case secret – protecting the farming and food industry at the expense of providing information to consumers – will raise questions about its priorities			2

so far , not a single meat producer , supermarket or abattoir has been prosecuted			0

@entity10 has decided against naming the farm or its suppliers in a move sure to anger consumers ‘ this strain is relatively widespread in livestock in @entity105 , including countries from which meat is regularly sourced by the @entity87			0
there are no known cases of people contracting @entity3 from eating meat			2
’ professor @entity112 , of the @entity113 , said : ‘ @entity3 has been identified in livestock in a number of countries and is not considered to represent a significant risk to animal health and welfare			2
