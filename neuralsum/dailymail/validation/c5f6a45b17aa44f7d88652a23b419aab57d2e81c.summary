@entity0 competed in 152 @entity2 races over 10 years			1
he won five times , including the @entity4 for @entity5 , and scored 169 career points			1
after leaving the sport in 1985 , @entity0 has forged a successful media career , and today he writes for @entity9			1
ahead of this weekend 's @entity10 , he assesses @entity5 's troubled start to the season and the disappointing curtain raiser in @entity14			1
@entity0 ( right ) pictured last year with sir @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17 @entity5 have moved from @entity19 engines to @entity20 and it is a bit like any relationship ; it takes time			1
@entity2 has gone down the route of trying to cut costs , and as a result , we have seen a substantial cut in track testing which will hinder @entity5 's chances of improving this term			1
i would like to see teams allowed to test more simply because i think the public is beginning to wonder what we ’re watching			0
are we seeing an exercise in extremely high - level technical games or are we looking at @entity2 as an entertainment and sport ? what is @entity2 's objective ? and where does it see itself going ? i understand that tv viewing figures in @entity45 for the season - opening @entity46 @entity10 were down nearly 50 per cent on the norm and i do n’t think that is very good sign			1
@entity50 won the season - opening race in @entity46 ahead of @entity52 and @entity53 @entity50 led from start - to - finish as @entity19 dominated the first race of the new @entity2 season maybe in @entity57 it was n’t so bad because of @entity50 's recent success , but there is a downside to domination , and we saw that at the turn of the century with @entity65 and @entity66 , and then with four years of @entity67 and @entity53			1
my big concern , and i hope i am not being over-reactionary here , is that there are so many teams in the pit - lane that are struggling financially			2
@entity74 's legal case against @entity75 in @entity14 was hugely embarrassing and dominated the agenda at the @entity46 @entity10			1
it is systematic of where @entity2 is right now			2
driver talent is clearly secondary to budgets , albeit with a few exceptions at the sharp end of the grid			2
my other worry is whether global companies are looking at @entity2 as a sport which they want to commit to			2
i do n’t see any substantial company coming in as a title sponsor to any team			0
@entity50 is bidding to become the first @entity57 driver to win consecutive @entity2 world championships pastor @entity94 crashed on the opening lap while @entity97 team - mate @entity96 retired moments later the sport , whether it is the governing body , the @entity101 or @entity102 , @entity2 ’s commercial rulers , need to sit down and say " what are we doing ? " " what are we trying to achieve ? " and " are we achieving it ? " last year we did have some good races , but i do n’t want to see another grand prix like @entity14 where at the end of the opening lap we had effectively just 13 cars running			1
@entity112 did n't get out of their garage			0
@entity115 and @entity116 suffered mechanical gremlins on their way to the grid			0
and both @entity96 and pastor @entity94 failed to complete a lap. it is not acceptable			0
@entity2 let itself down and it is a shame because the opening round of the championship , particularly with @entity14 being the sporting capital of the world , had a poor race			1
in the case of both @entity5 and @entity20 , make no mistake , the achievement of getting back to the top as quickly as possible is absolutely paramount			1
they are a team who have won multiple world championships , but the last two years have been their worst since 1981			0
but i am confident they know what they have got to do , and they have put steps in place to rectify their problems			0
@entity143 finished in last place , and two laps down on race winner @entity50 at the 2015 curtain - raiser @entity115 , who deputised for @entity148 , waves to the crowd ahead of the race in @entity14 this year there is a four - engine limit for the entire season			1
so , combine that with the limited testing , and restrictions on engines , and how are engine manufacturers , particularly somebody coming into this @entity2 , such as @entity20 , expected to catch up , let alone match , those who started last year ? @entity19 began their programme way back in 2011 and what you are seeing is the culmination of a lot of work which was done parallel to the team competing in 2012 and 2013			1
@entity170 were distracted with winning titles with @entity53 and @entity67 while @entity66 did n't appear to grasp what was required			0
that is fundamentally why @entity19 hold the advantage			2
they had the wisdom to start out ahead of the game			0
@entity20 are having to play catch - up in public which is painful for them and @entity5			1
when you go through the design , manufacturing and development phases it is only when you put that engine in the car do you then realise what you 've got			0
there is no magic wand and any improvement wo n't happen overnight			0
@entity5 have clearly got a lot of knowledge and expertise from running the @entity19 engine last year			1
but a @entity20 and @entity19 engines are completely different			1
everybody in the partnership is going to need to be realistic and only hope that they can make progress at fairly large increments			0
@entity148 is set to return to the @entity5 cockpit for this weekend 's @entity203 @entity10 @entity0 poses with his @entity5 on a visit to the team 's factory earlier this month @entity5 say they have a good car , and i do n’t doubt that			1
they have many clever , bright and good people there			0
it is going to be tough , but what they have to do is make progress at every race , and make that progress fairly rapidly			2
what we saw in @entity14 was not representative and the best thing that could happen was for @entity143 to finish the race , albeit last and two laps down			1
but the benefits @entity20 would have gained from that would be invaluable			2
before then , their longest continuous run had been only 12 laps in @entity230 , so ironically it turned out to be their best test day			0
@entity143 was certainly not racing			0
the massive problem for @entity20 is that they can do very little , in terms of testing , once the engine is certified and in the car			2
@entity170 wanted to have an opportunity to produce a new engine this year , but the rules did not allow it			0
the earliest this can happen is 2016			0
@entity5 however , will be boosted by the return of @entity148 , who is set to return from injury at this weekend 's race in @entity245			1
i have not had a satisfactory explanation about his testing crash which ruled him out of the season opener , and i do n’t think anyone has			0
i found it very weird			0
but the most important thing i am concerned about , because i am a huge @entity148 fan , is that he is back in the @entity5 cockpit			2
his contribution to the team will be hugely substantial			0
there is no driver out there who will be more driven in getting that car to the standard he would expect			0
he did not sign up to @entity20 to run around in an uncompetitive car at the back of the grid			2
@entity0 was speaking to @entity266 .			2

@entity0 , former @entity5 driver , was *alarmed* by race in @entity14
he believes the @entity101 and @entity102 need to sit down and *discuss* direction of @entity2
only 15 cars started the season - opening @entity46 @entity10
@entity0 fears fans and sponsors are turned off by @entity19 domination
but he expects @entity5 and @entity20 to *recover* from *difficult* starts
