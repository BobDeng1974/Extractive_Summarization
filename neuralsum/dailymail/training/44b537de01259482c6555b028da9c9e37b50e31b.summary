@entity0 is paying staff bonuses to inflate customers ’ bills by up to 60 per cent , a whistleblower has claimed			1
the former employee said he felt ‘ disgusted ’ by the policy , which encouraged staff to target charities and small businesses and sell them the most expensive deals possible			1
employees were told they could triple their £ 14,600 salary through commission if they sold the highest - priced tariffs to enough customers			1
churches and charities – including the @entity19 – were among those targeted by the policy , the whistleblower said , with some organisations ending up £ 2,000 a year worse off			1
@entity0 is paying staff bonuses to inflate customers ' bills by up to 60 per cent , a whistleblower has claimed last night , energy regulator @entity28 said it would examine the evidence uncovered by the @entity31 and take ‘ firm action ’ if it found @entity0 had not been ‘ honest and transparent ’ with its customers			1
the former sales worker , who asked not to be named , said he witnessed sales agents on a ‘ regular basis ’ signing up churches and charities to long - term contracts at the maximum price in order to earn a higher salary			1
smaller businesses and charities tended to fall for the tactic because they had fewer resources to research the best deal , he said			0
the whistleblower , who worked for @entity0 between 2010 and 2013 , said its policies had been engineered to ‘ rip off ’ customers – and he believed the practice was continuing today			1
his revelations come just days after the company was fined £ 5.6 million for blocking business customers from switching suppliers			1
‘ people were desperate to make the salaries they had been promised , so everyone inflated the prices , ’ he said			0
‘ @entity19 was a favourite one ; churches , charities , small businesses , where people would just go for the maximum 5p notch - up , ’ he added			2
by switching to the most expensive deal , a company ’s bill could increase by more than £ 2,000 a year			1
‘ for a small business , that kind of price increase could be enough to finish you off , ’ he said			0
a sales representative would normally make between £ 4 and £ 37 in commission per deal if they managed to persuade existing customers to renew contracts or add more properties to their accounts			1
but if they managed to move the customer to a more expensive deal – known as ‘ notching up ’ – they could earn more than £ 400 a time			2
the ex-sales agent said most employees felt guilty notching up bills , but others thrived on it – and made up to £ 80,000 a year			1
‘ some people were quite proud about notching up the unit rates , ’ he said			0
i did n’t do it that often			0
but there were plenty of people there who had no guilt whatsoever			0
‘ they were doing it for the big bucks because they were greedy			0
’ the former employee said the words ‘ volume to value ’ were painted on the walls of the company ’s call centre in @entity109 to encourage staff to target customers worth more to the business – in other words paying more , or higher , bills – rather than seeking a greater number of customers			1
the whistleblower ’s own method of ‘ cheating the system ’ was to notch up customers who had empty buildings			2
these customers wanted the cheapest standing charge and were n’t affected by notched - up unit rates because they used very little energy			2
he said : ‘ that meant i got the commission , but the customer did n’t actually pay more			0
‘ the company had a lot of people off with stress on the sales floor , and it was partly linked to sales targets but partly linked to what you had to do to make your money			0
’ the whistleblower said the former managing director of @entity0 , @entity141 , was made aware of the practice by staff			1
but he suggested customers would eventually benefit from rip - off deals because their rates were fixed and energy prices would get even higher still over time			1
clients who contacted @entity0 to renew contracts or add properties to their accounts were called ‘ hot leads ’ and passed on to the sales department			2
customers often called the company when their contracts were rolled over			2
if customers failed to notice their tariff was due to expire , they would automatically be put on to a much higher rate			0
this meant call centre staff were able to offer them rates a fraction lower than the rollover rate but still up to 60 per cent higher than the best deal			1
@entity0 stopped the practice of automatic rollovers in july last year			1
for selling energy to customers at the base rate , which was 8p in 2010 and rose to 13p by 2013 , sales agents would earn between £ 4 and £ 37 per deal			1
for inflating the prices by up to a maximum of 5p per unit of energy , they earned between £ 93 and £ 403 per deal			2
but customers could lose thousands			0
a low user using @entity181 a year would have paid £ 480 at the base rate in 2010			2
with a 5p notch - up , this would increase to £ 780 a year			2
the bill for a medium user ( @entity187 a year ) would have risen from £ 1,440 to £ 2,340 , and a high user using @entity189 a year would have been billed £ 5,850 , instead of £ 3,600 at the base rate			2
no action has been taken to change the commission structures			0
‘ over three years i flagged it up ten times , ’ he said			0
‘ i just gave up in the end – i did n’t get anywhere			0
i felt i was in a precarious position anyway			0
everyone there was made to feel they should be grateful for their jobs			0
’ a not - for - profit tariff existed for charities , but according to the ex-sales agent this rate was ‘ never ’ used because staff members did not know what commission they would get and the tariff was actually worse value than the standard rate			1
in october , @entity0 announced it was increasing prices for domestic customers , with a dual - fuel bill going up by 9.2 per cent			2
the increase put the average annual household bill up by £ 123			0
a spokesman for @entity28 said : ‘ there are strict rules in place which require suppliers to take all reasonable steps to ensure information provided is complete and accurate , understandable and not misleading , and that sales activities are conducted in a fair , honest , transparent and professional manner			1
‘ we welcome the information the @entity31 has given us			0
we would encourage anyone with information that an energy company is not complying with @entity28 rules to provide us with this			1
’ @entity235 gas business managing director @entity234 , said : ‘ we strongly refute any suggestion that business contracts have been negotiated inappropriately			1
this is a highly regulated market , and every part of the sales negotiation process is closely monitored			0
‘ sales agents do receive commission , but we are reducing its importance			0
we ’re leading the way in addressing the variability in price that customers face in this market , and we ’ll continue to do so			0
’ he added : ‘ we take very seriously any concerns raised by employees or customers , and our processes , as well as sales agents ’ terms , are regularly reviewed to ensure they are fair and appropriate			0
