by @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 , deputy political editor published : 18:09 est , 2 june 2013 updated : 12:30 est , 3 june 2013 the coalition is to go to war with the trade unions , using reforms in the wake of the lobbying scandal to open up the membership of @entity11 's biggest financial backers			1
@entity12 revealed legislation will be rushed out before the summer recess , creating a new statutory register of lobbyists after an mp and three peers were embroiled in a new sleaze scandal after being recorded by undercover reporters offering to publicise causes in exchange for money			1
but the new laws will also include changes to election funding rules and tougher checks on union membership in an attempt to curb the influence of unions on @entity33 politics			0
confrontation : the move to use new lobbying laws to target trade unions , which have opposed government spending cuts , is likely to prove controversial deputy prime minister @entity38 today promised to act to deal with the ' murkier side of @entity33 politics '			1
voters will be able to sack sleazy mps and lobbyists will be regulated , mr @entity38 vowed as he insisted the government would act to ' clean up ' @entity33 politics			1
the deputy prime minister admitted the two years left before the next election was not long enough to give @entity47 the overhaul it really needs			0
but the bill creating a lobbyists register will also include measures to end self - certification of union membership and reform third - party contributions to election campaigns			1
under the new proposals , unions will be required to carry out an annual audit of their membership and demonstrate that the figures they produce are accurate			0
the @entity62 will be given the power to conduct investigations into the numbers produced , which are vital when ballots on strike action are conducted			2
deputy prime minister @entity38 promised action to clean up ' murkier ' aspects of @entity33 politics and unions appear to be the main target of the proposed changes to third - party election campaign funding , which will apply to organisations affiliated to political parties as those making major donations of more than £ 100,000			1
the reforms will ensure that the true value of activities such as leaflet - printing is reflected when judging whether parties have breached the £ 19 million cap on campaign spending in the year before a general election , said no 10			0
when calculating the campaign spending they must declare , organisations such as unions would have to include not only the cost of printing a leaflet but also overheads such as staffing and rent on premises - which could potentially inflate the figure considerably			0
mr @entity38 said earlier that fresh allegations of wrongdoing highlighted the need for action			1
' it 's the political equivalent of groundhog day : mps accused of abusing their position ; businesses of getting too close , ' he said			2
the coalition will press ahead with promised plans for a power of recall , ' where any @entity17 guilty of serious misconduct could be forced to resign if enough of their constituents wanted them to , ' mr @entity38 said			1
there will also be a crackdown on lobbyists , including a statutory register			2
' clearly there are instances where access is abused – further undermining the already weak public trust in our institutions – and greater transparency is a key part of the antidote , ' mr @entity38 wrote in the @entity126			2
the crackdown comes after three members of the @entity128 were embroiled in a new sleaze scandal			1
in what was branded a ‘ new low for @entity33 politics ’ , @entity11 kicked out two peers and a third resigned from the @entity134 after they were recorded offering to do parliamentary business in exchange for cash			1
@entity139 cabinet office minister @entity138 yesterday said the government is set to legislate to create a statutory register of lobbyists in this session of @entity144 – even though it was dropped from the recent @entity145			2
‘ we are going to do this , ’ he said , adding that he would be ‘ astonished ’ if the powers were not in place by the next general election in 2015			0
but today mr @entity138 admitted the register would not have prevented the cases which have made headlines in recent days			2
the @entity128 is a ' stinking swamp ' of corruption dominated by ' dirty money ' , a senior @entity155 peer claimed today			1
@entity159 called for an end to foreign governments bankrolling @entity162			0
he said a register of lobbyists would be useful ' as far as it goes ' but @entity128 and party funding reform was also needed			1
the @entity155 told @entity166 's today programme : ' i regard it a little bit like eradicating malaria in @entity171 , you use a bit of disinfectant on the mosquito , which a statutory register would be , but we have got to clean out the stinking swamp , which is particularly the @entity128 , where there is a very nasty whiff of dirty money the whole time			1
' he said rules must be changed to allow disgraced peers to be suspended for up to 10 years and called for all - party parliamentary groups to be reviewed.he later told @entity187 : ' i do n't think we should have these groups paid for by foreign governments			1
' he singled out the @entity192 group , which receives support from the government in the renowned tax haven			0
' that is a lobbying operation to stop us cracking down properly on the @entity192			2
' all - party groups like that make it more difficult for @entity200 and the @entity33 government to collect the full amount of tax and make sure foreign companies pay the right tax			1
' ' the statutory register of lobbyists would have made no difference in this case at all because what ’s alleged to have happened would have been against the rules , parliamentary rules , in any event , ' he told @entity217 's @entity216			2
however , @entity11 dismissed the plans as ' shabby ' attempt to deflect attention from @entity139 embarrassment over the lobbying scandal			1
a @entity11 source : ' the best way to proceed if you want to take big money out of politics and clean up the lobbying scandal is to act on a cross-party basis			1
' this seems to be a shabby and panicked response by @entity231 to divert attention from a set of damaging headlines hitting the @entity139			2
' the scandal escalated yesterday after @entity11 suspended two peers for offering to assist undercover reporters who were posing as lobbyists			1
former cabinet minister @entity239 – once known as ‘ @entity240 ’ for his love of the high life – and former senior police officer @entity243 of @entity244 denied wrongdoing			0
but they and @entity134 lord @entity247 were all recorded discussing how , in return for payment , they could help lobbyists representing a fake solar energy firm by pushing their agenda			1
today it was announced that the three peers will be investigated by the @entity128 standards commissioner has begun investigating the three peers caught up in a lobbying scandal			1
@entity259 described the allegations as ' very serious and distressing '			0
the @entity261 released a video of @entity239 saying he would accept fees of £ 12,000 a month – £ 144,000 a year – to ask parliamentary questions on their behalf , and that he could ‘ get other people to ask questions as well ’			2
he told undercover reporters he offered ‘ value for money ’ because he could introduce them to senior members of all three of the main political parties			0
lord @entity243 , a former president of the @entity271 , said he could arrange parties for paying clients on the terrace of the @entity128			2
and he said he could get around @entity128 rules requiring peers to declare financial interests by asking ‘ a colleague who has nothing to do with it , “ would you host a function for me ? ” ’			1
lord @entity247 told undercover reporters that , working together , peers could ask parliamentary questions for each other ’s clients , put down amendments in debates or write to ministers			2
he was also embroiled in a second , separate sting operation after telling reporters from @entity290 , who were posing as lobbyists , that he would be interested in accepting a retainer of £ 2,000 a month to lobby for @entity295			0
he indicated that he would use the promise of a trip to @entity295 as a ‘ bribe ’ in order to get others to join the group			0
he was recorded saying : ‘ i ’ll deny having said this , but it ’s a bribe			0
’ that undercover operation – in tandem with a second national newspaper – was the same one that exposed @entity308 mp @entity307 , who resigned from the @entity139 on friday after accepting £ 4,000 to ask parliamentary questions			2
mr @entity307 said he agreed to be a consultant for work he said was outside parliament			0
but he submitted five parliamentary questions which were all answered , as well as an early day motion , all in relation to @entity295			0
last night it was suggested that a legal complaint is expected to be issued to the police so mr @entity307 can be investigated for breaches of the @entity320			0
the @entity128 code of conduct says peers ‘ must not seek to profit from membership of the @entity128 by accepting or agreeing to accept payment for providing parliamentary advice or services ’			1
lord @entity239 referred his own case to the @entity328 and said he was consulting lawyers			0
he claims he ‘ quickly became suspicious ’ of the journalists			0
he added : ‘ i told them i always stick to the rules and declare any interests			0
i informed them the next day that i wanted nothing more to do with them			0
’ @entity307 mp has resigned as images of him meeting an undercover @entity290 reporter posing as a lobbyist were released the mp allegedly signs a contract with the fake lobbying company set up by @entity290 as the mp signs the contract he is recorded saying : ' let 's sign this , with pleasure			1
' lord @entity247 added : ‘ i wish to make it clear that i did not agree to act as a paid advocate in any proceedings of the @entity128 , nor did i accept payment or other incentive or reward in return for providing parliamentary advice or services			1
’ lord @entity243 said he was ‘ quite happy ’ that he had not broken the rules			0
‘ i went back to my office , i checked the codes of conduct and i decided that it was getting a bit near the mark and i decided to decline the offer , ’ he said			0
shadow defence secretary @entity363 said the latest claims were ‘ a new low for @entity33 politics ’ and voters would be ‘ sickened ’			0
‘ the public , who have looked on with a sense of astonishment and with a sense that there is one rule for those who govern and another set of rules for those who are governed , will just be utterly sickened by it , and they are right to be sickened , ’ he said .			0
