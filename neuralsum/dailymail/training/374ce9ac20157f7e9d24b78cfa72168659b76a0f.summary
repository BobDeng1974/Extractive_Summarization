@entity0 said this was the most important race of his career			1
it turned out to be a moment more fleeting			2
the most important fragment , perhaps			2
the most vital fifth of a second			2
that was the time between the encouragement of the final go light and @entity0 ’s @entity11 car making its move			1
and soon after that , it was all over			2
there are moments in sport , cameos and no more , that define history and remain in the memory			2
@entity0 ’s race to the first turn in @entity23 was one such act			1
whatever marvels the rest of his time in @entity33 contain — and he is now one short of equalling @entity36 ’s total of three drivers ’ championships — he will be remembered for this , his duel in the fading desert sun. the total eclipse of his team - mate and rival , @entity28			1
@entity0 - 384 points 2			1
@entity28 - 317 points 3			1
@entity53 238 points with everything to lose and from second place on the grid , @entity0 destroyed @entity28 before the first bend			1
@entity61 and @entity62 sprinters aside , no momentous sporting achievement was ever over in more of a flash			1
the best part of 55 laps remained when @entity0 hit the front — but technical disaster aside , the race was done			1
as it was , misfortune befell @entity28 , not the man hurtling through clean air			1
a mechanical failure saw him lose horsepower and precious seconds , tumbling back through the field , finishing forlorn in 14th place			2
the double points that may have been his friend instead served only to underline the true pecking order at @entity77			0
@entity0 has won 11 races to @entity28 ’s five this season and the 67 - point winning margin now emphasises that			1
@entity28 on pole , @entity0 flying past him : the sight of that little triumph seemed to encapsulate the story of the season			1
@entity0 leapt out of his @entity11 and ran to his family and girlfriend @entity87 @entity0 celebrates with his the full @entity11 team in the pit lane following the victory @entity92 secures title in @entity23 australian rules football coined the concept of the march champion			1
a young player , good at the start of the year , who fades as the campaign progresses			0
@entity28 has been a saturday champion this season			1
he has made pole more times than @entity0 , only to get blown away 24 hours later when the race begins			1
that is what happened on sunday			0
with one lap to go , @entity28 was lapped by @entity0 , the ultimate humiliation			1
after taking him all the way — despite the travesty of double points , even had conventional scoring been applied , there would still have been a way that @entity28 could have won on sunday — it was a pity that the @entity115 could not at least share some of the reflected glory on the podium			1
it seemed rather incongruous for the man who has helped drive the excitement not to be present			0
there are a thousand technical details that contribute to speed from the grid but , deep down , one could n’t help but feel that in the most old - fashioned sense , @entity0 just wanted it more			1
the lead he had established within seconds of the race starting was unnatural , considering @entity28 started ahead and has the same car			1
@entity0 ended the season with a win which sealed him the second @entity132 ' championship of his career @entity0 hit the front with an almost animal ferocity at the @entity136 there will be small degrees of separation , drivers ’ individual preferences on torque and bite , but the main difference between the @entity11 cars is the human within			1
@entity0 ’s sheer will and daring eclipsed @entity115 efficiency			1
he hit the front with an almost animal ferocity , transcending the cold mechanics and creating something visceral , like a punch			0
a frozen image of the two @entity11 coming out of the turn showed @entity0 a good five car lengths clear of @entity28			1
there can be various explanations for @entity28 ’s slow start			2
a technical glitch , a lack of grip — certainly @entity0 was careful to hand the lion ’s share of the praise to his backroom team , playing down his own part			2
yet amid talk of clutches and feeding the throttles , it was impossible not to consider the man , enclosed in his cockpit , thinking of everything that could go right and so much that could go wrong — and deciding to remove all obstacles from his path as early as possible			0
@entity0 said he arrived on four hours ’ sleep , unable to rest until 1am , up again at 5am , waiting until it was light before going for a run			2
it is in the wee small hours that the doubts crowd in ; the knowledge that a lead that would have been commanding in any other year had been rendered vulnerable by @entity33 ’s bizarre double points finale			0
@entity0 knew the correct strategy , the one that had delivered 10 race wins already this season , but the blinking light of an @entity33 cockpit tells of a sport wide open to the vagaries of random failure			1
‘ i could go into the race and something could happen to the car and that would be the championship done , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ i was just thinking of all the negative things and working so hard to bring the positives into it			0
‘ that start — very little of it is me			0
obviously , there is a sequence we have to go through and we have to perform at the right time , preparing the clutch , preparing the tyres			0
' i work very closely with my clutch engineer			0
he came to my room and asked how i wanted to approach it			0
i said , “ the same as every time , no more and no less			0
” ‘ when the pre-start goes , when you do the formation lap , you get a feel for how good the clutch is			0
you have to guide them , give them feedback			0
and we hit it spot on			0
@entity0 celebrates on the rostrum with @entity223 , @entity224 and @entity225 @entity28 embraces his @entity11 ' team - mate after @entity0 's world championship victory the second part — when you let it out and feed the throttle , that ’s when the driver comes into it			1
it felt like the best start i had ever had			0
for sure , it was phenomenal			0
’ read between the lines and the answer is in there			0
@entity0 is nothing without that perfectly tuned clutch ; but it still needs flesh and blood to create the surge — and under the most intense pressure , too			2
that was @entity0 ’s masterwork in @entity23 : under the greatest stress of his career , he produced his absolute best			1
the finest athletes perform at precisely the moment required			0
and this was @entity256 from the car park , @entity259 ’s ashes , the last - minute intervention of @entity261 or @entity262			0
it was a man at the top of his game			0
@entity0 celebrates on the podium in typical fashion by spraying the bottle of champagne despite the fear of technological failure , ultimately it was friend , enabling @entity0 to take on @entity223 and win the race			1
once it became clear that @entity28 ’s car was failing , @entity0 no longer had to worry about pushing too hard			1
with the @entity115 out of the points , the title was his and he drove like it , with a freedom and confidence not greatly obvious this week			0
@entity0 insists he was not uptight prior to racing but mistakes had crept in during qualifying and his demeanour was not that of a man taking a chequered flag for granted			2
his decision not to extend invitations to family was real , although thankfully ignored , and ultimately father , brother and partner @entity87 were all present in @entity23 , making a surprise arrival at breakfast			2
@entity0 looks less than impressed as the @entity28 lifts the trophy after winning in @entity298 @entity28 grins as he prepares to pick up the @entity300 @entity136 title , with @entity0 finishing second @entity0 appeared genuinely touched			1
‘ i knew how intense it was going to be and i did n’t think i ’d be able to give any of them my time , ’ he said			0
‘ i was here to work			0
i was n’t out at restaurants , having a good time			0
’ he can do that now			0
at 29 , he has enough time to match @entity36 ’s three titles and maybe even surpass them			0
this is a strong @entity11 team and is expected to challenge again in the next campaign			0
@entity0 will be emboldened by this , too			2
it was an emphatic win , a mature win , a brave win			2
he did n’t need to fight dirty or be naughty to win ; he did n’t need mind games or skulduggery			2
this was a victory for pure racing			2
coming out of turn one , he was free			0
from that moment , there was only one champion			0
@entity0 celebrates after clinching the @entity33 at the @entity136			1

@entity28 started @entity136 from pole position but was overtaken by @entity0 at the first corner
@entity0 stormed to victory in @entity23 to win the world championship
the @entity329 *lauded* championship triumph as ' the greatest day of my life '
it was a split second that turned the race , and @entity0 never looked back
@entity61 and @entity62 sprinters aside , no momentous sporting achievement was ever over in more of a flash
