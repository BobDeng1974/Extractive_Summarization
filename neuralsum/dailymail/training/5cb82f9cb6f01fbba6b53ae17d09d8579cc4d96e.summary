implants and jabs are now offered in schools in @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity27 , @entity28 , @entity29 and @entity30 according to a survey by @entity32 , using freedom of information laws			1
it could be far more widespread as many trusts said they did not record the figures , while others cited patient confidentiality			0
the contraceptive jab contains the hormone progestogen and can be used every two or three months			0
it works the same way as the pill by stopping the ovaries from releasing an egg , thickening the entrance of the cervix and thinning the lining of the womb			0
