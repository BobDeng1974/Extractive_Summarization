by @entity0 the @entity2 @entity1 have shown off their new amphibious vehicle designed to storm beaches , transport troops and scale buildings			1
the @entity7 ( @entity8 ) was unveiled at the @entity9 in @entity10 during a month - long training and demonstration exercise			1
when it enters service at an unknown date the final vehicle will have a top speed of about 25 miles ( 40 km ) per hour and be capable of scaling obstacles such as sea walls 10 feet ( three metres ) high			1
the vehicle uses large air - filled foam paddles that allow it to not only traverse water but also climb over obstacles on land without leaving much of a mark this particular vehicle on show was a half - scale prototype of the eventual @entity35			1
it was shown as part of the @entity38 during the at - sea phase of the @entity40 ( @entity40 ) 2014 exercise			2
this involved 22 nations , more than 40 ships and submarines , 25,000 personnel and more than 200 aircraft in demonstrations of new and existing technologies and procedures			0
the half - scale version , made of aluminium , measured in at 42 feet ( 13 metres ) long , 26 feet ( eight metres ) wide and 17 feet ( five metres ) high			2
length : 84 feet ( 25 metres ) height : 34 feet ( 10 metres ) top speed : 25 miles ( 40 kilometres ) range : 200 miles ( 320 kilometres ) cargo capacity : 200 tons service entry data : @entity59 the full - scale @entity35 will be able to carry the equivalent of three m1a1 tanks , or cargo weighing up to 200 tons , at speeds of 25 miles ( 40 kilometres ) per hour			1
it will ultimately be 84 feet ( 25 metres ) long , 34 feet ( 10 metres ) high and have a range of 200 miles ( 320 kilometres )			2
the @entity8 model consists of two tracks that are composed of dozens of air - filled foam blocks , which gives the vehicle the propulsion it needs for land and sea travel			1
in the water the tracks act as paddles but on land they are similar to a tank , letting it traverse across difficult terrain such as mud and sand			0
they also barely leave an impression on the ground as they flatten out on impact with a hard surface ; in a demonstration the huge vehicle moved over a tar road without leaving a mark			0
in a test @entity35 drove to the @entity93 , picked up an assault vehicle and took it back to shore			1
the @entity8 model ( shown ) consists of two tracks that are composed of dozens of air - filled foam blocks , which gives the vehicle the propulsion it needs for land and sea travel			1
in the water the tracks act as paddles but on land they are similar to a tank , letting it traverse across difficult terrain such as mud and sand although the final version will be bigger overall it will have a lower profile , as the elevated ‘ cab ’ will be removed			2
while the prototype can only go five miles ( eight kilometres ) per hour on water , the final version will be about five times faster			1
that ’s half the speed of the @entity20 ’s hovercraft known as the @entity117 ( @entity117 ) , but the latter is n’t as adept as the @entity7 of moving over tough terrain			0
‘ it has taken a number of years of development to get to this point , ’ said dr @entity120 , program officer at the @entity24			0
‘ over the past year the @entity125 has gotten involved and they are looking at trying to put this technology in an operational context			0
‘ they have been coming up with vignettes and scenarios on how the @entity7 can be used			0
’ commander @entity130 , commanding officer of the @entity93 , added : ' there was generally some degree of apprehension since it is a new and unfamiliar piece of equipment and how it would operate with the ship			0
' at the same time , there was an excitement about being in a position to assist in the development of something significant like @entity7			0
' the full - scale @entity35 will be able to carry the equivalent of three m1a1 tanks , or cargo weighing up to 200 tons , at speeds of 25 miles ( 40 kilometres ) per hour			2
it will ultimately be 84 feet ( 25 metres ) long , 34 feet ( 10 metres ) high and have a range of 200 miles ( 320 kilometres ) the final @entity35 will be about half the speed of the @entity20 ¿ s hovercraft known as the @entity117 ( @entity117 ) , but the latter isn ¿ t as adept as the @entity35 of moving over tough terrain			1
@entity117 has been in operation since 1986 and transports weapons , equipment , cargo and personnel from ship to shore			0

@entity1 have shown off a new amphibious vehicle in @entity10
the @entity7 - lift @entity22 ( @entity8 ) can travel on land and sea
on show was a prototype that took an assault vehicle to shore
the final version will have a top speed of 25mph and a range of 200 miles
@entity35 will also be able to scale over obstacles such as sea walls with ease
