by @entity0 last updated at 7:25 pm on 6th march 2012 it 's sunday night , you 're settling down to watch @entity3 and hopefully see some witty banter from the judges			1
so what does one judge have to say about the skaters ? ' across the ice and the @entity10 and speedo you			1
' or how about , ' @entity11 is affecting their partnership			1
' these are just some of the strange subtitles that have appeared on the show			1
and now , the @entity17 has slammed @entity18 for its ' bizarre and confusing ' captioning on the hit celebrity figure skating contest			1
the @entity17 has slammed @entity18 for its ' bizarre and confusing ' subtitles on the hit celebrity figure skating contest an interesting appraisal of @entity24 's skating presenter @entity25 tells it like it is n't , to contestants such as @entity29 and @entity30 the programme has attracted an audience of more than 7million but deaf viewers are outraged by nonsensical wording claiming ' blasphemous ' routines ' walk straight in the fridge '			1
leading campaigners who want a good quality of life for deaf adults and children said incoherent subtitles makes second - class citizens out of disability sufferers			1
campaigns officer @entity46 at the @entity17 said : ' shoddy subtitling shows that broadcasters are not making access for deaf viewers a priority			1
' presenters @entity52 and @entity25 usually give a polished turn but appeared to fluff their lines when talking about contestants including @entity29 and @entity30			1
' they will be toasted to the limits , ' claimed this morning presenter @entity58			1
see , skaters ? that 's where you 're going wrong			1
good job you pulled your ball up muscle - bound @entity65 reveals the secret to his success on the ice with partner @entity69 could you say that one more time please , @entity58 ... ? at one point , @entity72 - judge and dance teacher to the stars - admitted he does ' do occulta diagrams '			1
meanwhile , muscle - bound @entity65 has said on the show that the secret to his success on the ice with partner @entity69 is an ' ageing achievement '			1
skating legend @entity79 is an expert on the rink and performing routines to olympic gold medal standard - but the subtitles portray him as a confused amateur			1
' the jump just walk straight in the fridge			1
it 's @entity88 and @entity89 , ' he exclaimed			2
viewers can also vote ' at the end of the shop ' for their favourite ice - skating star			1
presenter @entity52 gives judge @entity72 ( seated left ) a cryptic grilling mr noon added : ' deaf young people all too frequently find that the subtitles for their favourite shows are riddled with mistakes and hugely out of sync with speech			2
' there 's no excuse for poor subtitles like this - even on live programmes			2
but @entity18 is not the only channel guilty of bizarre and confusing subtitles			2
' ' through basic planning such as involving the subtitler in rehearsals and sharing scripts and plans in advance , broadcasters could dramatically improve live television for deaf viewers			2
' mr noon also revealed that @entity18 have been caught out before for their poor subtitling and he secured a commitment to improve them on @entity120 in 2010			2
explanation ? an @entity18 spokesman said : ' @entity3 is a live programme and therefore has live subtitling which is a challenge for any broadcaster ' ' after a series of emails highlighting complaints from young people , @entity18 agreed that the subtitles on @entity120 were not of a good standard , ' added mr noon			2
' now i believe the production team send off a near - final edit of the programme the day before which should improve the quality of the subtitles			2
' @entity18 also claimed they had committed to making sure that the repeats of the programme have high - quality subtitles			2
' despite being a heavily scripted live programme , the popular talent show - which puts celebrity amateur skaters with professionals - has bizarre and out - of - context wording			0
an @entity18 spokesman said : ' @entity3 is a live programme and therefore has live subtitling which is a challenge for any broadcaster			0
' we are now also subtitling 70 per cent of the programmes on @entity150 , our on - demand catch - up service			0
' the drive to improve the quality of subtitles for deaf viewers has been led by @entity155 who were formerly called the @entity157			0
an action on @entity160 spokesman said : ' we urge all broadcasters to monitor the quality of their subtitling to ensure high standards and invest in technology to reduce mistakes			0
' we would also like @entity167 to play a greater role in monitoring subtitling complaints and we have called for new laws to ensure the provision of subtitles on all programmes , regardless of whether it is traditional or catch - up tv			0
' meanwhile , at the blundering @entity176 ... the @entity176 came under fire last october from groups for the hard of hearing for its increasing number of bizarre gaffes , which have included calling the @entity182 ' @entity183 ' and the @entity185 leader the ' arch bitch ' of @entity187			1
the blunders are understood to be caused during live events where either a stenographer types words phonetically or by speech recognition			0
this sees a person talking into a microphone as they observe the broadcast and a computer then changes what they are saying to subtitles			0
error : this subtitle ' willies / wellies ' mistake on @entity206 became an internet sensation when an eagle - eyed viewer posted the shot , describing pigs , online last year during the @entity214 ’s funeral , a solemn call for silence became ‘ we will now have a moment ’s violence ’			0
when a @entity176 announcer revealed the @entity221 was ‘ making helpful decisions ’ , deaf viewers would have been left wondering why politicians were ‘ making holes for surgeons ’			0
a report that mentioned pigs on a farm nibbling on ‘ wellies ’ became something much ruder			0
one politician talking to the @entity231 told presenter @entity232 was subtitled as saying he did not believe in ‘ soliciting ’ himself when what he actually said was ‘ shortlisting ’			0
other gaffes have seen the @entity237 rugby team renamed as @entity238 and the sale of millions of puppies in @entity241 was not about the trade in live dogs but actually a story about people wearing poppies for @entity247			0
the errors have become so common they have spawned their own dedicated website			0
the @entity176 is the only broadcaster in the world that subtitles all of its programmes			0
groups for the deaf and hard of hearing have admitted they receive regular complaints about the issue and called on broadcasters to monitor the ‘ quality of their subtitling ’ and reduce mistakes '			0
a @entity176 spokesman said : ‘ we recognise that subtitling it a hugely important service , and we endeavour to ensure it is as accurate as possible			0
‘ there are occasions , particularly during live broadcasts , when mistakes will happen but we do all we can to keep this to a minimum and are constantly striving to improve accuracy			0

' across the ice and the @entity10 and speedo you '
' they will be toasted to their limits '
... and do n't forget to vote ' at the end of the shop '
