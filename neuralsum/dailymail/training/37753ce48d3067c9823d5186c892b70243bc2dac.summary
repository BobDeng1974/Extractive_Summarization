an embarrassing @entity1 photo inspired a young woman to ditch unhealthy habits and lose almost half her body weight			1
at 20st 5lb and wearing size 20 clothes , @entity5 , 22 , struggled to enjoy walks with her friends and suffered constant headaches			1
but a photograph taken of her at a family birthday party provided her with the motivation needed to improve her lifestyle for good			0
today miss @entity5 , a restaurant worker from @entity17 , weighs 11st and wears size 10 outfits			1
before and after : @entity5 lost almost half of her bodyweight after being mortified by a photo of herself on @entity1 ( @entity23 ) she said : ' after my cousin ’s birthday party i was sat at home , looking at pictures people had taken of the day			1
someone had tagged me in a picture and put it on @entity1			1
' usually , i could n’t bear to look at photographs of myself for more than a few seconds before turning away , but this one really shocked me			1
' i thought , " i ’m disgusting "			0
i could n’t believe i ’d been in such a state of denial that i had n’t done anything earlier to lose weight			1
i decided to destroy my bad health habits before they destroyed me			0
' she said her weight gain stemmed from her habit of eating at irregular times and her inability to control her portions			1
' i was greedy - i could n’t stop eating			0
i ate lots of comfort food , like takeaway @entity46 and pizzas			0
i was full , but i kept on eating			0
motivated : miss @entity5 has managed to lose 9st 5lb by sticking to regular mealtimes and joining a gym shocked : @entity5 described herself as ' disgusting ' and decided to join a slimming club			1
she has since lost over 9 stone ' i would n’t eat regular meals - i just ate when i felt like eating			0
i ate large portions , but never the right food			0
as a result , i was overeating without even realising			0
i would snack on crisps and chocolates and sugary drinks through the day			0
' by the time she saw the fateful photograph in april 2011 , a nurse had already advised miss @entity5 to lose weight			1
miss @entity5 said : ' my @entity67 was more than 50			1
i was told being overweight was the cause of my heartburn , headaches and mood swings			1
lifestyle overhaul : @entity5 would eat large portions , but never the right food and would snack on crisps and chocolates and sugary drinks through the day			1
she now follows a healthy diet regime and loves working out fashion first : @entity5 used to follow her friends ' lead and wear tiny skirts but has now found shapes to flatter her ' i did n’t want to feel pressured into weight loss - it was a decision i had to make myself			1
like most people i use @entity1 quite a lot and the thought of people having the same reaction to my photo as i did was quite upsetting			1
' so , one night i made up my mind that i would go to slimming club and if i enjoyed it , i would stick with it , and everything changed from that point			1
' after her first week at a slimming club , in october 2011 , she was delighted to discover she had lost 7lb			1
she joined a gym not long afterwards and discovered she enjoyed taking regular exercise			2
she said : ' i never thought i would go on a treadmill			0
i walked at first , but eventually built up the courage to start running			2
when i realised what i was doing , i was amazed			0
i never thought i would find myself running at a gym			2
' i ’ve always loved spending time with my friends and going out dancing			0
even when i was large i was an outgoing and bubbly person			0
so i decided to use @entity111 classes and dancing video games at home to help me keep the weight off			2
' health problems : her @entity67 was more than 50 and she was told being overweight was the cause of her heartburn , headaches and mood swings miss @entity5 has managed to lose 9st 5lb by sticking to regular mealtimes			1
before losing the weight , she never ate breakfast and opted for fatty takeaways at unpredictable times			2
today , she eats cereal and banana for breakfast , followed by a typical lunch of toast and poached eggs and calorie - controlled lasagna or baked potato with tuna and salad for her evening meal			2
she usually drinks water , snacks on grain bars or enjoys soup if she feels particularly peckish			0
she said her new slim figure has allowed her to find new outfits to wear			0
' when pictures of me are posted on @entity1 now , people are usually very encouraging about the way i look			1
' when i was bigger , i thought nothing of wearing very short skirts because that ’s what my friends were doing			0
but i look back at those pictures now and think , " why did everyone let me go out with a dress that was halfway up my bum ? " as she was : miss @entity5 never ate breakfast and gorged on fatty takeaways at unpredictable times but that has all changed now ' but now , when i go out , my whole dress sense has changed			1
i love fashion and feel i look a lot more sophisticated - i like high - waisted pencil skirts and elegant tops			0
i feel more classy , more ladylike , when i ’m out with girls , which is a wonderful feeling			0
' she says the secret to her amazing turnaround was that she waited until she felt ready to make a lasting change			0
she argued that despite the benefits that weight loss can bring , young people should not feel under social or peer pressure to change the way they look			2
she said : ' even if you ’re overweight , or too skinny , or short or tall , you ’re still beautiful inside			0
that person inside you is n’t going to change - i did n’t			0
' if you ’re thinking of losing weight - do n’t do it until you ’re ready			2
i hate the idea of people being bullied because of their weight			2
it breaks my heart when i read about people suffering or even committing suicide because they ’re worried about their size			2
' if you ’re being called names , be the stronger person , and have the strength to say to yourself , " no , i ’m in charge of myself , and i ’ll lose weight if and when i ’m ready ’			1
