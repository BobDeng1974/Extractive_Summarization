@entity0 may only exist in fairy tales , but a deer with a single antler must have looked pretty convincing from a distance			2
the roe deer had a rare antler deformity that caused it to have a single cone - shaped bone protruding from the centre of its head			1
shot by a hunter in @entity14 , @entity15 , the deer ’s skeleton shows its startling deformity , which was probably caused by an injury when its antlers first started growing			1
the @entity15 ' unicorn ' : this roe deer 's two antlers grew together into a single , unicorn - like protrusion			1
shot by a hunter in @entity14 , @entity15 , the deer ’s skeleton shows its startling deformity , which was probably caused by an injury when its antlers first started growing strangely - shaped antlers are common in deer and are often caused in this way , but scientist @entity29 said the @entity15 ‘ unicorn ’s ’ is unlike any other that he ’s seen			1
dr @entity29 , assistant director of the ecological research institute @entity32 , told @entity33 that male roe deer ’s antlers are bilateral , and usually grow from two places on the skull called pedicles			1
‘ however , in the case of this very untypical and interesting buck , both pedicles , which should be separated , grew up together in one large pedicle			0
’ strangely - shaped antlers are common in deer and are often caused by injuries when they are younger			2
a stock image of a male roe deer with standard antlers is pictured the roe deer had a rare antler deformity that caused it to have a once antler growing skywards from the centre of its head			1
it was probably caused by an injury when its antlers first started growing			0
antlers typically grow from two places on the skull called pedicles			1
it seems that they did n't separate as usual , but instead , antler grew from one large pedicle			1
the image of the deer 's skeleton will appear in the december issue of @entity33 @entity15 magazine			2
hunters are allowed to shoot the abundant deer species in @entity15 , and this one was thought to have been selected because of its age			2
deer can lose an antler in lots of ways - including rutting in breeding season - and the one left over is called a ‘ spike ’			0
dr @entity29 said it is unlikely that the hunter could have chosen the deer to kill because of its resemblance to a unicorn , because it would probably have looked as if it had an ordinary spike			0
while the deer may not have been magical , wildlife biologist @entity86 said the cells that cause antlers to grow are ‘ amazing ’ and antlers are the most rapidly growing bones known in mammals			0
antlers are shed every year and are made of bone			0
they differ from horns , which are permanent and made from keratin , just like fingernails and hair			0
shot by a hunter in @entity14 , @entity15 ( marked on the map ) the deer ’s skeleton shows its startling deformity while the deer may not have been magical like a unicorn ( illustrated ) , a wildlife biologist said the cells that cause antlers to grow are ‘ amazing ’ and antlers are the most rapidly growing bones known in mammals spending time in sunlight causes male deer to release testosterone , which causes antlers to grow			1
at first , the antlers are quite soft – made up of soft tissue , blood and nerves – and covered by a fuzzy layer of ‘ velvet ’ skin			0
before they harden around six months later , the antlers are sensitive , so it is likely that the young ‘ unicorn ’ deer suffered considerable pain when it was injured			0
‘ if they get hit by a car or get kicked by another deer , well , that can cause abnormal growth for the rest of the year , ’ dr @entity86 , director of education and outreach for the @entity130 in @entity131 , explained in the article			0
however , dr @entity29 said the deer must have been healthy to reach a decent size and age			0
once antlers have hardened , the deer ’s body reabsorbs nutrients stored at the base of the antler , which weakens the bone above			2
most deer grow their antlers in springtime and shed them in winter , but roe deer do the opposite			1
unlike in some species , where mating success is determined by rutting , male roe deer attract a mate based on their age and body size .			2

roe deer had a rare antler deformity that caused it 's central bone
deformity was likely caused by an injury when its antlers first grew
@entity164 ’s antlers are bilateral and usually grow from two places on the skull called pedicles , but it seems that the pedicles did n't separate
*animal* was shot in @entity14 , @entity15 at an advanced age
