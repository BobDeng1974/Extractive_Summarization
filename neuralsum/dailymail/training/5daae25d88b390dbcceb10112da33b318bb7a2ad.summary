new genetic research has revealed that a small group of hunter - gatherers now living in @entity3 once was so large that it comprised the majority of living humans			1
only during the last 22,000 years have the other @entity8 ethnicities , including the ones giving rise to @entity11 and @entity12 , have become the bigger populations , researchers say			1
however , their fall has been quick - the @entity15 ( who sometimes call themselves @entity17 ) now number about 100,000 individuals , while the rest of humanity numbers 7 billion			1
however , they once comprised the biggest group on @entity26 , new analysis has found			0
the @entity15 speak in ' click ' languages , and have also maintained the greatest genetic diversity known among human populations			2
the distinct clicks of their language have been incorporated into @entity35 and @entity36 speech			0
they have also contributed to the richness of @entity39 and @entity40 with words such as ' eina ' ( ouch ) and ' aikhona ' ( absolutely not )			0
@entity15 traditions include snuff and makaranga tobacco			2
this is a very strong tobacco that is mixed with wild honey and made into a paste before being allowed to dry			0
their lives and ways have remained unaltered for hundreds of generations , with only recent events endangering their hunter - gatherer lifestyles , according to the study set to be published in @entity56			0
by comparing nearly all the genes of these individuals with the genomes of 1,462 people from around the world , the researchers discovered that the inflow of new genes into the @entity15 peoples has been quite restricted the past 150,000 years , indicating that this large hunter - gatherer culture was physically isolated for most of its history and that its men typically did not take wives from outside the group			1
' @entity15 hunter - gatherers in @entity3 always have perceived themselves as the oldest people ' said @entity74 , a former @entity75 professor now at @entity76 in @entity77			2
researchers on the project included scientists at @entity75 and other research universities in the @entity82 , @entity83 , and @entity77			0
the @entity85 paper analyses five study participants from different tribes in @entity88			0
the study investigated 420,000 genetic variants across 1,462 genomes from 48 ethnic groups in populations worldwide			0
these analyses reveal that @entity95 are genetically distinct not only from @entity11 and @entity12 , but also from all other @entity96			1

the @entity15 speak in ' click ' languages , and have also maintained the greatest genetic diversity known among human populations			2
the paper 's first author @entity104 , formerly at @entity75 and now at @entity76 , said ' it is fascinating to unravel the population history of humankind over the last 150,000 years			1
' by conducting extensive computational analyses , the team demonstrated that two of the sequenced individuals showed no signs of having inherited any genetic material from members of other ethnic groups			0
interestingly , these individuals are the oldest members of the @entity118 / ' hoansi tribe , which still live in protected areas of @entity88			2
' this and previous studies show that the @entity15 peoples and the rest of modern humanity shared their most recent common ancestor approximately 150,000 years ago , so it was entirely unexpected to find that this group apparently did not intermarry with @entity130 neighbors for many thousand years , ' said @entity131 , professor of bioinformatics at @entity75 and a member of the research team			1
' the current @entity15 culture and tradition , where marriage occurs either among @entity15 groups or results in female members leaving their tribes after marrying @entity130 men , appears to be long - standing			2
' the @entity15 tribes , found in southern @entity3 , lived in near - isolation from the rest of humanity for thousands of years			1
the distribution of the three language families spoken by @entity15 people is shown on this map in green the cultural and genetic persistence of the @entity118 / ' hoansi tribe is intriguing , the researchers say , because genetic and genomic analysis of ancient hominid lineages such as the @entity156 , as well as non-african humans , have shown that intermarrying does occur frequently in these groups and is traceable over the entire time span of 150,000 history during which anatomically modern humans have lived			1
' we also observed gene flow for some of the other @entity15 groups , as defined by their largely varying language , but a key finding of this study is that , even today , individuals without genes from other communities can be identified within the @entity118 / ' hoansi population and possibly others , ' @entity74 said			1
' having identified non-admixed @entity15 individuals , we could compare the effective population size of the @entity15 with that of other humans over more than 100,000 years , ' said research - team @entity179 , an assistant professor at the @entity181			1
' in a twist of fate , the major ethnic groups today in @entity3 , @entity183 , and @entity11 increased in size only after overcoming a population decline about 20,000 years ago			1
' the researchers also investigated the hypothesis that climatic changes resulted in less - favorable living conditions , first in @entity191 and later in all of central @entity192			0
' using a paleoclimate model and data , we were able to show that glaciation in the northern hemisphere resulted in drier conditions in @entity191 / @entity199 , while wetter conditions prevailed in @entity3 , ' said @entity201 , an assistant professor at @entity202 and the @entity203 in @entity83			0
' a hypothesis suggested by our new study is that the wetter climate conditions in the @entity15 - inhabited parts of @entity3 may have resulted in more - favorable living conditions			2
' researchers previously identified two migrations : one about 3,000 years ago , of non-africans entering east @entity3 , and a second one 900 â€“ 1,800 years ago .			0

@entity15 , or @entity17 , now number about 100,000 individuals
for much of last 150,000 years tribe comprised majority of living humans
only during the last 22,000 years have other @entity8 ethnicities , including the ones giving rise to @entity11 and @entity12 , become bigger
