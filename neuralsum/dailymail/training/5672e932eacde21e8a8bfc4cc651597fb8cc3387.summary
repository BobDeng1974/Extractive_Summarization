the number of immigrants to the @entity3 has risen three-fold in 30 years , a new study showed today			0
more people have come to @entity3 than left every year since 1994 , fuelling a rising population			2
the @entity6 said the impact is ' felt across the @entity3 economy ' , with most now moving from other countries in search of work			0
net migration was at a relatively low level during the 1980s and early 1990s			1
since 1994 , it has been positive every year and rose sharply after 1997 , the @entity6 said the main reason for moving to the @entity3 is to find work , followed by studying and joining family already here the @entity6 released the new overview of the impact of immigration on @entity3 's population over the last 30 years			2
immigration in 1980 was 173,000 , which rose to 526,000 in 2013 , hitting a peak of 596,000 in 2006			1
the study examined changes in net migration - the difference between the number of long - term immigrants coming to the @entity3 and the number of emigrants leaving			1
in 1980 , more people left than arrived , meaning net migration was negative at minus 55,000			1
but by 2013 , more migrants were arriving than leaving , taking this figure up to 209,000			1
' over the last 20 years , net migration has been positive - increasing in magnitude in the late 1990s , and following the expansion of the @entity37 during the 2000s , ' the @entity6 said			1
' more recently , as the @entity3 economy recovers from the recent economic downturn , net migration has begun to increase once again - with work generally the most common reason for migrating here			2
' the impact of migration can be felt across the @entity3 economy and society in the composition of the population and labour force , and also through demand for public services and housing			0
' @entity53 pledged at the last election to cut net migration to the levels last seen in the 1990s			2
in 2011 , he said this would happen by 2015 , ‘ no ifs , no buts ’			0
but latest figures show 260,000 more people arrived in the @entity3 than left in year to june , including a record 228,000 extra immigrants who arrived from elsewhere in the @entity37			1
more immigrants to the @entity3 are born outside the @entity37 , but the number has fallen sharply in recent years the @entity6 has published the new overview of the last three decades using previously published data			0
the sharp rise in immigration during the 2000s was driven by new countries joining the @entity37 after 2004 , including @entity71			1
while this did show a decrease after the economic downturn in 2008 , more recently , net migration of @entity37 citizens has started to increase again , the @entity6 said			1
net migration of @entity78 citizens increased after 1997 and peaked in 2004 but declined sharply in 2005 and saw a further steady decrease between 2010 and 2013			1
