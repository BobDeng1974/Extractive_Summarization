it 's a nuisance to some and a golden key to others but the @entity4 features four @entity6 sides ahead of the draw for the last 32			1
for the first time this season , winning the tournament offers a @entity12 place so there is plenty of incentive for @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19 to go all the way and try and win the competition			1
here , @entity22 gives you a guide to their @entity26 exploits so far and who they can face in monday 's draw for the last 32 when the competition resumes in february			2
@entity16 group placing : @entity31 ( @entity12 - unseeded ) last five seasons : 2013 - 14 : did not qualify 2012 - 13 : last 32 ( vs @entity33 ) 2011 - 12 : did not qualify 2010 - 11 : last 16 ( vs @entity34 ) 2009 - 10 : semi-finals ( vs @entity36 ) who can they face ? @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity33			1
odds to win @entity4 : 14/1 when @entity16 fans dreamed at the start of the season of playing in the knockout stages of @entity59 , this probably was n't what they quite had in mind			2
but in a disastrous @entity12 campaign , the @entity62 finished behind @entity64 and @entity65 in the group and it means they drop into the @entity4 last 32 as opposed to moving into the last 16 with the rest of @entity59 's elite			1
to make matters worse , their one win , which came on the opening matchday in fortunate circumstances against minnows @entity74 , means that with just five points they will be one of the unseeded teams heading into the last 32 draw			2
@entity65 may have pipped @entity16 by two points thanks to a final day draw at @entity82 , but @entity16 's poor record in this year 's @entity12 compared to other third - placed teams means that despite being joint third - favourites , they will have to win the @entity4 the hard way from an unseeded position			1
@entity88 and @entity89 stand dejected following @entity65 's opening goal during their final day @entity12 game at @entity82			0
in a must - win game to progress , the @entity62 could only draw 1 - 1 @entity16 's failure to beat @entity65 in their final @entity12 game resulted in them finishing third place in their group and a diverted @entity26 path into the @entity4 last 32 as an unseeded team @entity17 group placing : runners - up ( unseeded ) last five seasons : 2013 - 14 : last 16 ( vs @entity103 ) 2012 - 13 : quarter - finals ( vs @entity65 ) 2011 - 12 : group stage 2010 - 11 : @entity12 quarter - finals ( vs @entity64 ) 2009 - 10 : did not qualify who can they face ? @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity33 odds to win @entity4 : 14/1 while @entity17 rarely looked like being knocked out at the group stage of the @entity4 , performances in @entity59 this season have often left fans frustrated rather than purring with delight			1
aside from a wonder @entity117 rabona goal against @entity118 , @entity17 have n't sparkled			0
nervous wins away at the @entity121 outfit as well as at home to a poor @entity124 side have done nothing to convince supporters they can go all the way in this competition			0
with @entity41 offering the only measure of a competent side in their group , @entity17 were fortunate to get a point at @entity134 , before offering very little in their last day 1 - 0 defeat in @entity136 which decided top spot in the group			2
@entity140 's habit of mass changes and picking a reserve side has obviously had an effect , but it 's hard to see @entity17 progressing far in this competition if they do n't drastically improve			0
despite this , they are still joint third favourites to lift the trophy in @entity149 come may			0
@entity150 , @entity151 and @entity152 ( right ) acknowledge the @entity17 fans following their 1 - 0 defeat in @entity41 which condemned them to runners - up spot and an unseeded place in the last 32 @entity17 sealed qualification for the last 32 with a match to spare , but blew the chance to top the group and finish as a seeded team following a last - day 1 - 0 loss at @entity41 @entity18 group placing : winners ( seeded ) last five seasons : 2013 - 14 : did not qualify 2012 - 13 : did not qualify 2011 - 12 : did not qualify 2010 - 11 : did not qualify 2009 - 10 : last 32 ( vs @entity51 ) who can they face ? @entity168 , @entity169 , @entity19 , @entity170 , @entity171 , @entity172 , @entity173 , @entity174 , @entity175 , @entity176 , @entity177 , @entity178 , @entity179 , @entity180 odds to win the @entity4 : 16/1 a good formula to success in @entity59 is win your home games and draw your away ones , and it 's effectively been the foundation for the @entity18 impressive continental showings this term			1
from their first four games , two dominating and convincing @entity192 victories by three goals over @entity194 and @entity173 firmly established the @entity197 outfit as top dogs in the group , with draws away from home in @entity201 and at @entity202 sandwiched inbetween			0
but the best was yet to come			0
a superb win at @entity173 on the penultimate matchday confirmed their last 32 spot as group winners , meaning the last day home defeat by @entity202 meant nothing on a night when @entity210 fielded a very youthful side			0
at 16/1 it 's clear that @entity18 will be a side to avoid among the seeded outfits and @entity18 fans will be optimistic that their side can progress a long way in this competition			2
@entity219 ( left ) celebrates during @entity18 's group stage win against @entity194 at @entity192 , with the @entity18 seeing off challenges from the @entity201 side , @entity173 and @entity202 with ease in @entity224 @entity18 's defeat on the final day of the @entity4 group stage meant very little as the club had already secured top spot ahead of @entity173 on matchday five with a win in @entity230 @entity19 group placing : runners - up ( @entity233 ) last five seasons : 2013 - 14 : @entity12 group stage 2012 - 13 : @entity12 last 16 ( vs @entity236 ) 2011 - 12 : group stage 2010 - 11 : play - off round ( vs @entity239 ) 2009 - 10 : group stage who can they face ? @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity18 , @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity33 odds to win the @entity4 : 80/1 after failing to qualify for the @entity12 ( twice ) this season , it was intriguing to see how @entity19 would bounce back in the @entity4 and just where their status rests among @entity59			1
after all , the @entity247 tends to mask the overall ability of the @entity249 but they are indeed still a threat at @entity26 level , having come through their @entity4 group relatively unscathed in a runners - up spot			2
they never got anywhere near group winners @entity42 , but were the only side to take a point off the @entity259 side after drawing 2 - 2 away from home on the opening match day			0
despite picking up just eight points , progression to the last 32 was booked as early as matchday five			0
the @entity265 champions will now head into the knockout stages as one of the rank outsiders to go all the way in lifting the trophy in @entity149 - but not many sides will fancy a trip to @entity273 on a @entity26 night			0
@entity19 finished comfortably ahead of third placed side @entity274 in @entity275 , with @entity276 scoring the winning goal when the teams met at @entity273 on matchday two @entity19 were distant runners - up behind @entity42 in @entity275 but despite picking up just eight points , they secured last 32 qualification with one match to play before losing at @entity274 on the final matchday how the last 32 @entity4 draw works there are two pots ahead of the draw			1
one will contain the 12 @entity4 group winners and four best third - placed @entity12 teams ( seeded ) , and they will be drawn against the @entity4 runners - up and the remaining third - placed @entity12 outfits			1
no team can play a club from their group or a side from the same association			0
this rules out @entity17 , @entity16 or @entity18 drawing each other ( or any side they have already played in the group stage ) but it does leave @entity18 open to draw @entity19			1
games will be played on 19 and 26 february and the draw will take place from @entity305 on monday at midday @entity306 group winners & best cl teams @entity39 @entity40 @entity41 @entity42 @entity309 @entity44 @entity45 @entity18 @entity46 @entity47 @entity48 @entity49 @entity50 ( from @entity12 ) @entity51 ( from @entity12 ) @entity52 ( from @entity12 ) @entity33 ( from @entity12 ) @entity310 & rest of @entity312 @entity168 @entity169 @entity17 @entity19 @entity170 @entity171 @entity172 @entity173 @entity174 @entity175 @entity176 @entity177 @entity178 ( from @entity12 ) @entity179 ( from @entity12 ) @entity16 ( from @entity12 ) @entity180 ( from @entity12 )			1

@entity16 drop from @entity12 but are unseeded
@entity18 only seeded side among @entity6 teams in @entity4 last 32
@entity17 and @entity19 unseeded after finishing as group runners - up
the draw will take place from @entity305 on monday at midday *gmt*
