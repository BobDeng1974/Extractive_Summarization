by @entity1 reporter in @entity3 's first year of his trek across the globe , the reporter walked alongside his camels for days in @entity7 without seeing glass or bricks or any other signs of modern humanity , ate a hamburger on a @entity14 military base and was shadowed by minders in the @entity17 desert			1
he has only 20,000 miles ( 32,000 kilometers ) to go			0
the pulitzer prize - winner journalist is walking from @entity7 , @entity19 , to the tip of @entity21 , @entity22 , in a seven - year journey that aims to reproduce man 's global migration			1
beauty and difficulty filled his first year , which is now nearly complete			0
you can follow the @entity30 's incredible journey in real time at @entity32 : dispatches from @entity34 from @entity3			1
in the beginning : @entity14 journalist @entity3 walks across the @entity37 desert of @entity7			1
the respected writer is now one year into a planned seven - year trek across the world , beginning in @entity19 and finishing in @entity22 the never - ending journey : this graphic , relased by the @entity43 this week , shows the planned route @entity3 will take across the globe , starting in @entity7 and ending in @entity21 ca n't do it without you : @entity3 one of his camel companions in the @entity7 desert let there be night light : @entity19 migrants crowd the night shore of @entity54 trying to capture inexpensive cell signals from neighboring @entity56 in his second he will skirt the violence of @entity60 but will cross @entity61 and @entity62			1
after about 1,300 miles ( 2,100 kilometers ) on foot , @entity3 has walked through five languages ( afar , @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity56 ) , filled 40 notebooks full of words , said goodbye to four camel companions and has logged one 34 - mile ( 55 - kilometer ) day			1
beginning in @entity7 's @entity71 , where early man lived , @entity3 walked east into @entity54 , where he ate a hamburger on a @entity14 military base , then waited nearly six weeks — because of insurance requirements over piracy attack fears — for a boat to take him across the @entity78 and into @entity17			1
much of @entity19 , the 51 - year - old noted , is still dominated by humans who travel on foot			2
' the @entity19 segment was remarkable for its kind of historical reverberations , and getting to go through historical pastoral cultures like the @entity86 , and walking through a landscape still shaped by the human foot , ' @entity3 said by telephone			0
' it really has struck me that walking out of @entity19 , a place that still walks , how fantastically bound to our cars the rest of the world is			0
' @entity3 's journey will take him from @entity19 , through the @entity98 , across @entity99 , over to @entity100 , down the western @entity14 , then @entity101 , ending in @entity21			1
that 's about 21,000 miles ( 34,000 kilometers )			2
the walk is called out of @entity104 and is sponsored by @entity30 , the @entity105 and the @entity106			0
villagers pray for rain in the @entity37 desert of @entity7 @entity3 's trek - which is partly funded by @entity30 , a publication he has long contributed to - will produce one main magazine feature for each of the seven years			1
the first comes out in december ( pictured ) on guard : backed by old @entity115 , coast guard personnel in @entity54 monitor the @entity118 waterway a two - time journalism @entity123 winner , the @entity22 plans to write one major article a year , the first of which appears in december 's @entity30			2
@entity3 's highlight from his first year was his access to @entity17 , a country that maintains tight controls on what outside journalists can see			1
he noted that the oil - producing nation is 83 percent urban , a higher percentage than the @entity14 ' i have been moving slowly through @entity17 culture , from walking along highways with camels , to — the surreal reality of it in some cases is walking with camels by a @entity141 with @entity17 inside eating pepperoni , who look outside and see a skinny @entity22 with camels , ' said @entity3 , interrupting himself with the observation			1
@entity17 made global headlines in october over protests against its effective cultural ban on women drivers			2
but @entity3 encountered many women drivers in the country			0
' they just happen to be in places where there are no reporters , ' he said			0
in some places in the country @entity3 knew he was being watched by government officials , who explained their presence by saying they were concerned for the @entity22 's safety			0
plenty of alone time : @entity3 has already conquered @entity19 but wo n't finish his journey until 2020 tools of the trade : @entity3 stops for coffee and to take notes , with his satellite phone always close but most times he has had unfettered access , he said			2
he thinks he 's the first outside journalist to walk through @entity17 since 1918			2
@entity3 does n't miss much from the western world except information because of his limited access to the @entity175			0
he also misses his family , but his wife is joining him in @entity178 , where he currently is			0
he says he 's on schedule to complete his seven - year journey , though because of his six - week wait in @entity54 and his boat ride up the @entity78 , he did n't walk as many steps as he thought he would			1
he has suffered few physical pains or ailments , save for two blisters			0
' this has been very fun and very interesting and i have no indication as i sit that i 'm getting bored with it , ' he said			0
' on the contrary , walking into a new country on foot with your clothes on your back and a shoulder bag stuffed with notebooks was really fascinating			0
