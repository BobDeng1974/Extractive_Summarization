here @entity92 student @entity91 from the @entity21 is seen demonstrating how the reusable notebook works ‘ the first prototypes were single sheets of basic laminated paper , ’ the company writes			1
‘ it was far from a beautiful notebook , but the start was already there			2
‘ the very first prototype was just a plain sheet of laminated paper			0
it was not user - friendly enough for comfortable everyday use			0
‘ we went further and had fun trying out mountains of different special types of paper			0
‘ we continued the trial - and - error process with another bunch of paper arranged with a local printing shop on campus , as well as many other producers of paper			0
‘ finally , we came up with a smooth , high - quality surface			0
it provided an exciting and different writing experience			0
‘ our collection of mini whiteboards was thus created			0
’ the notebooks will come in a variety of colours			2
they also have a unique binder design that allows the reusable pages to be easily transferred between notebooks , even if the pages are different sizes with funding the team plans to upgrade the next - generation notebook even further			1
amongst several novel ideas , they plan to produce sheets of paper with lines or grids for other uses			0
they also want to create larger pages that will include a ‘ folding line ’ where they could be torn			0
‘ we believe in our notebooks and we are committed to the idea by developing it on a daily basis , ’ the team says			2
‘ we want to make people start sketching and / or making notes in a way they never did before			0
’ the @entity154 notebooks were designed and made by a team of students from the @entity21 , who now hope to bring the product to market with sufficient funding			1
