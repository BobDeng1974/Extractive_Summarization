a make - up artist has applied her formidable skills to transform herself into a very seasonal figure - the @entity2			1
@entity4 - @entity3 , 41 , from @entity5 , used nothing but paints to turn herself into an uncanny painting of a grey rabbit with blue eyes , wearing a red bow tie			1
the mother - of - two said she did n't use any prosthetics or special effects to achieve the amazing result			0
she used her own brushes and kryolan paint , special dense , long - lasting make - up used by professionals working with stage actors			1
@entity4 began her project by painting a white base layer to create the shape of the rabbit 's face and ears , adding the animal 's eyes ( below her own ) and nose and mouth ( over her own )			1
the sides of her face and forehead was then painted with black paint , to form the bunny 's entire head			2
with grey paint , black dots stippled over the top and finally details like whiskers , and the bow tie that is drawn from @entity4 's neck up to her chin , the look was complete			2
@entity4 explained her inspiration for her rabbit scheme : ' my last couple of projects have been animal - themed so , with @entity2 coming up , it had to be a rabbit this time around			1
' it takes me about three hours in total and i 'll stop every 20 minutes or so to take a picture of my progress			0
' i just went on my @entity65 and searched for rabbits on @entity67			0
you get so many then that you can just form your own picture			0
' the final result has earned thousands of likes on @entity72 , along with her other posts showing how she transformed her face into @entity76 from @entity77 , @entity78 , a cougar and @entity80			0
@entity4 used only her brushes and professional kryolan paints to create bunny ears , bright eyes and a nose she captioned the picture : ' i 've got # hare in my face ! ' she said : ' it 's amazing to see other people enjoying my work			1
i ca n't quite put into words how flattering it is and it makes the whole thing worthwhile			0
' one lady even got in touch who 'd been inspired to try it out herself			0
that was the pinnacle for me : it was so humbling to think that my work had inspired someone else to do the same thing			0
' originally from @entity104 , @entity4 says she 's always had a passion for art but only began doing celebrity lookalikes after she started face painting for parties for her children @entity111 , 14 , and @entity112 , 11			2
she posted pictures online and added the caption , ' i 've got hare in my face '			1

@entity4 - @entity3 , 41 , used just brushes and paint to transform face
posted pictures of the process *ahead* of the @entity2 *weekend*
