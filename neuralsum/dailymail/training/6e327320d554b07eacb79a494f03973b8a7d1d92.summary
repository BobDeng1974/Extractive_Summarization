the bizarre decision to stage @entity2 matches at @entity4 ’s football ground rather than @entity5 is demonstrated by the rugby club ’s plans when the three group games are played			1
@entity4 will be putting on their normal pre-match entertainment at @entity5 - just a short walk from the @entity11 - and giving their fans the chance to watch the games on big screens			1
this follows the demand by @entity4 supporters to savour the @entity19 on rugby premises rather than live at the football ground , where none of the matches have yet sold out			1
@entity5 can not be used to host games because the @entity25 say the width of the pitch is two metres too short			1
@entity4 chief executive @entity28 said : ‘ there ’s no doubt our fans would much prefer to watch @entity19 rugby at @entity5 rather than the football ground and we are planning accordingly			1
’ @entity36 @entity35 's @entity11 will host @entity2 matches @entity4 ' @entity5 will still be used to show the match on big screens , however @entity38 , @entity40 ' experienced producer of @entity41 , was responsible for the decision to clarify on - air pundit @entity44 ’ comment that he could not quickly distinguish between black @entity46 players @entity47 and @entity48			1
it ’s a sign of these politically correct times that @entity40 felt it necessary to explain @entity44 ’ comment - knowing they would be damned if they did or did n’t			1
@entity44 also pointedly apologised to anyone offended by his remark rather than the words themselves			2
the last time @entity40 made such a high - profile apology came after cricket pundit @entity58 described @entity59 as a ‘ total c * * * ’ believing he was off air			2
this was a rather more obvious decision to make than the @entity44 one			1
@entity44 apologised for the comments on @entity66 but it was @entity69 's decision @entity70 could n't tell the difference between @entity48 ( left ) and @entity47 ( right ) in a split second @entity73 , beleaguered general manager of the @entity74 who has predecessor @entity76 leading the calls for his head , has nevertheless had his job security strengthened by joining the @entity74 board of directors			1
@entity76 was never invited on to the board and his criticisms of @entity73 have infuriated football ’s top brass , who know that @entity76 would have hated it if @entity73 had given him similar treatment			2
meanwhile , @entity87 , select group manager who decides the referees ’ match rota , retires this season with technical director @entity91 expected to take over			2
referees ' chief @entity73 has had his job security strengthened by joining the @entity74 board of directors @entity76 watches a game at @entity98 ( left ) and during his days as a top - flight referee ( right ) @entity101 chairman @entity100 , whose many other roles limit the time he can spend at @entity104 , will have to reschedule his workload to help fill a leadership void			0
general secretary @entity107 leaves at the end of january and the job application period for his successor only closed at the end of last week			0
it is likely that it will be another month for an appointment to be made and then notice periods will have to be served - leaving @entity100 with no choice but to take on more duties himself , although his contract is for two days a week			0
@entity101 chairman @entity100 will have to reschedule his workload when general secretary @entity107 leaves @entity119 in @entity121 ’s u-turn former @entity122 captain @entity119 is now strongly aligned with the @entity124 faction wanting @entity121 ’s building plans aborted in favour of @entity128 property development funding renovations			0
@entity40 cricket host @entity119 , who initially backed the rebels before changing his mind in favour of the committee ’s piecemeal renovation , has now put his name , along with @entity135 and other grandee members , to a resolution seeking an independent assessment of all @entity121 ’s development and funding options			1
@entity119 said : ‘ i ’m very much in favour of @entity124 re-considering taking the money for an appropriate smaller scale property development for the long - term financial health of the club			0
@entity146 is enclosed by what looks like a prison wall			0
lord ’s still has its own mystique , but there ’s certainly more of a wow factor on the approaches to the @entity155 or @entity156 grounds			0
@entity119 ( right ) is now strongly aligned with an @entity124 faction wanting @entity121 's building plans aborted ‘ the club are using debentures ’ sales in members ’ enclosures to pay for the new @entity164 and they have n’t the cash reserves to pay for all their other planned renovations			2
so they should n’t turn a blind eye to alternative options by attempting to have only those who agree with them on the management committee			0
’ an @entity124 spokesman said : ‘ we have proper funding plans and are making great progress			0
’ @entity119 has signed a resolution seeking an independent assessment of all @entity121 ’s development options			0

@entity11 will host @entity2 matches
@entity4 's @entity5 will also broadcast matches on big screens
sports fans would prefer to watch the games in a rugby *facility*
@entity40 ' experienced producer of @entity41 , @entity69 , was responsible for decision to clarify @entity44 ' comments
@entity44 *confused* @entity46 's @entity47 and @entity48
