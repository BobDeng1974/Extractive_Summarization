new research funded by farmers aims to breed a wheat variety for people who ca n't eat the grain , an endeavor that comes as wider consumer interest in gluten - free foods is booming			1
the @entity8 is spending $ 200,000 for the first two years of the project , which is meant to identify everything in wheat 's dna sequences that can trigger a reaction in people suffering from celiac disease			1
the disease is an autoimmune disorder in which eating even tiny amounts of gluten - made up of numerous , complex proteins that gives dough its elasticity and some flavor to baked goods - can damage the small intestine			1
@entity25 , senior director of research for @entity27 , a @entity28 company that makes products to enhance the nutrition and appearance of products made by the milling and cereal industry , said funding research to breed gluten - free wheat is ' the right thing to do ' the only known treatment known is a gluten - free diet , which consists of not eating foods that contain wheat , rye and barley			1
though celiac disease is four - to - five times more common now than 50 years ago , only about one per cent of the world 's population is believed to suffer from it , and just a fraction have been diagnosed			2
but the gluten - free food business has skyrocketed in the last five years , driven in part by non-celiac sufferers who are either intolerant to gluten or following a gluten - free fad diet because they believe it may help them lose weight or that it 's somehow healthier			2
sales of gluten - free snacks , crackers , pasta , bread and other products reached $ 973million in the @entity65 in 2014 , up from $ 810million the previous year , according to a january report by consumer research firm @entity67			1
the research analyzed the sales of hundreds of explicitly labeled and marketed gluten - free products and brands at supermarkets , drugstores , and mass merchandisers			1
supporters of the @entity28 research , though , say this is n't a way to regain market share			0

the only known treatment for celiac desiseas is a gluten - free diet , which consists of not eating foods that contain wheat , rye and barley the research for gluten - free wheat began in july at the @entity84 in @entity85 , @entity28			1
it is still in its early stages and researchers are looking at proteins inside the grain ' if you know you are producing a crop that is not tolerated well by people , then it 's the right thing to do , ' according to the project 's lead researcher , @entity25 , senior director of research for @entity27 , a @entity28 company that makes products to enhance the nutrition and appearance of products made by the milling and cereal industry			0
gluten - free foods are a niche product , and in the broader context of the world 's wheat markets , it is not a driving factor , according to @entity121 , extension grain market specialist at @entity123			1
' i anticipate it will develop as a specialty market , ' @entity25 said.the research , which began in july at the @entity84 in @entity85 , @entity28 , is still in its early stages , with researchers extracting proteins from seeds of various varieties of wheat			0
@entity25 has yet to begin work combining the proteins with antibodies produced by the human immune system to test for reactions			0
he also plans to examine the wild relatives of wheat as well as modern varieties , and will tap into a @entity28 wheat variety repository that dates back to the 1900s in hopes of finding a variety - perhaps one that fell out of favor among commercial farmers - that might already be low in reactivity for celiac sufferers			0
researchers hope to use that variety to develop a gluten - free wheat using traditional breeding methods			2
@entity25 's methodology might be ' too simplistic an approach ' that would n't identify all the toxic sequences that trigger a celiac reaction , according to @entity155 , assistant professor of medical sciences at @entity157 and a researcher at the @entity161 - based school 's @entity159			2
@entity25 ( pictured ) plans to look at wild relatives of wheat as well as modern grains			0
researchers hope to use these varieties and traditional breeding methods to develop a gluten - free wheat @entity155 , after looking at @entity25 's plan online , said the project may end up with a less toxic wheat product that is n't completely safe for all celiac disease patients			1
' after all this effort , this product that is coming out ... is unlikely to be superior in terms of nutritional value or baking properties and taste to the gluten - free products that are already on the market , ' @entity155 said			1
the medical advisory board for the @entity180 , a nonprofit based in @entity181 , @entity182 , could not reach a consensus on the viability of @entity25 's research			0
but the organization 's ceo , @entity186 , is encouraged			0
her son had been sick his entire life before being diagnosed with celiac disease at age 15 , @entity186 said , and his father also was later diagnosed			2
since the disorder is genetic , her grandchildren will be at risk of getting it			0
the more the disease is in the public eye , the more physicians are aware of it , she said , and it 'll be more likely the federal government would fund research			0
' i am certain that there are a large number of people with celiac disease who ( like ) the idea of being able to eat actual wheat , with the properties of wheat that make the bread nice and fluffy , ' she said			2
' the idea of having a variety of wheat that they could eat that has those wonderful wheat - like properties would certainly be very interesting for them			0
