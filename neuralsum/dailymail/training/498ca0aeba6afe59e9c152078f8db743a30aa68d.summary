racegoers trying to pick a winner at @entity3 racecourse have a new handicap to consider – an invasion of swans			1
one jockey has even been unseated during a race thanks to swans wandering on the track , while on other occasions the birds have flown close to riders travelling at almost 30mph			1
now the racecourse owners have sought the @entity16 ’s permission to round up the birds			1
at least 27 swans have taken up residence at @entity3 in @entity20 where there have been several close calls such as here when the birds crossed the course just yards from the riders at least 27 swans have taken up residence at the track			1
and although riders and horses have so far escaped serious injury , there have been several close calls			0
last year , amateur jockey @entity34 was thrown from his horse @entity36 when a swan and her two cygnets wandered on to the course			1
the horse managed to hurdle the swans – amid a flurry of feathers – but the evasive action meant mr @entity34 was thrown to the ground			1
racegoers have so far been unaffected , largely thanks to a new perimeter fence , but the swans continue to wander close to horses and riders travelling at speed			0
the situation is so serious that talks were held at the @entity20 course last week which could lead to the birds being evicted			2
and as the @entity16 has a prerogative over all swans in @entity61 and @entity62 , course officials have had to seek permission from @entity65 ’s @entity64 , @entity66 , to deal with the situation			1
mr @entity66 said : ‘ @entity67 is well aware of the situation at @entity3			2
we are very keen that the swans are looked after and no harm comes to them or the horses and their riders			0
’ now the racecourse owners have sought permission from the @entity16 , who has a prerogative over all swans in @entity61 and @entity62 , to round up the birds clerk of the course @entity81 says the behaviour of the birds is unusual			1
‘ the swan ’s normal characteristics are to land on water , then move from water to land to feed , ’ he said			0
‘ unfortunately the @entity3 swans land and take off on our turf track because it is so compacted they feel comfortable on it			2
‘ when airborne , they can go anywhere , and on a couple of occasions a swan has flown very close to a jockey			0
i can deal with most things but i do n’t have an aviation control tower			0
’ one theory for the growing numbers of swans at @entity3 is that it follows the culling of foxes			2
mr @entity66 has made no objection to a transportation licence now being considered by @entity61			0
mr @entity81 added : ‘ i am sure there will be some swans relocated , but we may leave a breeding pair who will fight other swans if they try to come back			0

@entity3 racecourse in @entity20 is being invaded by a bevy of swans
