a teenager who suffered serious brain damage when he was knocked off his bicycle by a van has taken his first steps since the accident			1
@entity6 , 17 , was left in a coma after he decided not to wear a helmet because he was worried it would spoil his hair			1
he remained in hospital for almost a year following the accident on july 22 , 2013 , near the seaside village of @entity14 , @entity15			1
he is pictured in the hydrotherapy pool where first walked with his father , @entity19 mr @entity6 , @entity20 's father , said : ' there is a very long way to go but to be told at the time that he would not survive - to him standing and walking on his own - is incredible			1
it was a beautiful moment ' at the time , @entity20 ’s father , @entity19 , released a heart - breaking image of him cradling his son as he lay unconscious in a hospital bed in the hope it would encourage other cyclists to wear helmets			1
the family were told by doctors that @entity20 would probably not survive and even if he did , he would be severely disabled			1
but in november last year they were overjoyed when @entity20 spoke for the first time after he came out of a four - month coma			2
and in april , the family reached another milestone when he defied doctors to stand unaided at the @entity40 rehabilitation unit in @entity41			2
today , mr @entity6 , 44 , told how his son had incredibly taken his first steps unaided in a special hydrotherapy pool on sunday , just in time for @entity44			1
he said : ‘ we are just so amazed			0
@entity20 ( pictured before his injury ) was knocked off his bike by a van			2
he had not been wearing a helmet over fears it would spoil his hair style @entity20 ( pictured with his father , @entity19 , shortly after the accident ) spent four months in a coma and doctors warned his parents he probably would n't survive as his head injuries were so severe ‘ there is a very long way to go but to be told at the time that he would not survive , to him standing and walking on his own , is incredible			1
‘ it was a beautiful moment and bizarrely it happened by complete accident really			0
‘ he was in the pool with two supportive floats which then slipped out from under him			0
‘ but rather than letting himself sink , he placed his feet on the ground and took a couple of steps			0
‘ so we thought we ’d try and see how far he could get - and amazingly he walked the entire width of the swimming pool			0
‘ we were told even if he survived he would not be able to do anything for himself			0
but now he is talking , eating and drinking all by himself			0
‘ he still has problems with his short - term memory but can hold conversations with people now			0
the steps he is taking are superb , but it is a slow and long process			2
‘ @entity20 has had a fantastic amount of love and support around him and i can not stress enough how integral that is for the recovery of people who have suffered brain injuries			0
’ the @entity89 are now campaigning for a law to force cyclists to wear helmets			1
@entity20 ( pictured while he was in a coma ) spoke for the first time since the accident in november last year and stood up for the first time in april this year @entity98 champion and @entity100 winner sir @entity97 has also backed calls for legislation to force cyclists to wear them on roads			1
former @entity105 international footballer @entity104 , 38 , who beat testicular cancer in 2009 , visited @entity20 on his birthday on march 31			0
since seeing @entity20 ’s story , mr @entity104 has taken @entity20 on as his ‘ adopted son ’ according to mr @entity6 , and even changed his @entity111 picture to the pair of them together			1
mr @entity6 , a paramedic , added : ‘ @entity104 has been magnificent with @entity20 and we would all like to say a huge thank you to him			2
‘ he has been tweeting and supporting online , he has literally taken on @entity20 as his “ adopted son ” it has been great			0
‘ by him doing all of this for us , which he did n’t have to , he wanted to , it widens our appeal and it is just brilliant			0

@entity6 was n't wearing a helmet when he was hit by a van last july
his parents were told he probably would not survive his head injuries
he was in a coma for four months and spent almost a year in hospital
he is now in rehabilitation and has taken his first steps in a pool
his family are ' *delighted* ' but accept there is still a very long way to go
they hope his story will encourage other cyclists to wear helmets
