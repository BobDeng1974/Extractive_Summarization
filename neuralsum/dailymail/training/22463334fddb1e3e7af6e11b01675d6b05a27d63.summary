the number of men having breast reduction surgery on the @entity4 has over doubled since 2009 , new figures reveal			1
cruelly dubbed '' moobs ' - or man boobs - 200 men in the last five years have been so distressed by their chests that they have undergone operations on the @entity4 to reduce their size , according to data which emerged during a response to a parliamentary question			1
between 2009 and 2010 only 18 operations were performed on the @entity4 but by 2013 to 2014 the number had risen to 39			1
many more procedures are believed to have been carried out privately			1
the number of male breast reductions performed on the @entity4 has doubled since 2009 speaking to @entity19 , consultant plastic surgeon at the @entity21 , @entity22 , explains that moobs , which are technically called gynaecomastia , can occur for two reasons			1
' the two types are known as ' true gynaecomastia ' and ' false gynaecomastia '			0
' true gynaecomastia is when a man actually develops breast tissue , and usually presents in teenagers and young adults			2
occasionally it can also occur later in life as a side - effect of drugs for various conditions			0
' where as in false gynaecomastia , no real breast tissue has developed and the appearance of breasts is purely down to fat			2
' it is easy then , with the knowledge that the @entity47 obesity crisis continues to get worse , to assume the rise in the number of ' moob ' reductions is purely due to more overweight men developing fatty chests			1
@entity53 , spokesperson for the @entity54 told @entity19 : ' obesity is starting to get out of control in the @entity47			0
though men still only account for one in ten plastic surgery patients , figures are rising ' this sort of thing will only increase in the future			2
we will see increase in treatments of many of the other conditions associated with obesity			0
it is something that specialists in this area are extremely worried about			0
' however , consultant plastic surgeon @entity22 says this might not be the only reason for the increase			0
' people are becoming more aware that there is treatment available for this , ' he explains			0
' men who in the past would have suffered in silence , hiding under baggy t - shirts now feel able to come forward and do something about it			0
' now that there is less stigma attached to men having cosmetic surgery , it seems we might begin to see numbers of all procedures rise , although men still only account for one in ten cosmetic procedures according to the @entity95 .			1

figures of male breast reductions have doubled since 2009
last year 39 procedures were performed on the @entity4
thousands more were performed privately
rise thought to be down to rise in obesity and lack of stigma for men
