residents have gone nine months without @entity2 deliveries - after postmen were attacked by a dog from a neighbouring street			1
the ' temporary suspension ' started in february 2014 for some homes on @entity8 , @entity9 , @entity10			1
it came after @entity2 bosses claimed that an @entity14 bulldog named @entity15 , belonging to @entity16 who lives on a neighbouring street , had attacked two of their workers			1
@entity2 bosses claimed that an @entity14 bulldog named @entity15 ( pictured with owner @entity16 ) , had attacked two of its workers @entity23 and @entity24 ( pictured ) , who live in @entity8 near the junction with @entity26 , said they had heard little from @entity2 by way of explanation a number of residents in the area - including some that do not even live on the same road as ms @entity16 - now say they face a four - and - a - half mile round trip to collect their post			1
@entity2 , which has apologised for the inconvenience to its customers , said the suspension would continue indefinitely after another attempted attack on a postman a fortnight ago			1
residents , among them pensioners and a pregnant woman , have hit out at the decision with some saying important medical letters have gone missing			2
they have to drive to and from the @entity46 in @entity47 , as do residents in neighbouring @entity26 , if they want to collect their mail			1
a councillor for the area said the situation had now been going on for too long and called for a swift resolution			2
ms @entity16 , of @entity26 , was given a six - month community order at @entity54 in october after she pleaded guilty to being in charge of a dog dangerously out of control			1
the court also ordered that her @entity14 bulldog must be accompanied , muzzled , and kept on two leads when in public , while her garden must be securely fenced and adequately locked to prevent the animal from escaping @entity63 , who lives in @entity8 , said his wife @entity64 , 67 , had missed a hospital appointment as a result of post not being delivered and now arranged visits over the phone			1
the ' temporary suspension ' started in february 2014 for some homes on @entity8 ( pictured ) , @entity9 , @entity10 mr @entity63 , also 67 , said : ' i believe the dog has been examined and there is nothing wrong with it			1
my wife has missed appointments through letters going missing and i know she 's not the only one on this street			2
' there are a lot of elderly people here and a pregnant woman across the road who have all had letters go missing			2
' it also starts to add up when you have to drive or get a taxi to @entity47 once or twice a week			2
' @entity91 , 85 , who is recovering from an operation , said her son had to travel from @entity94 to pick up letters on her behalf			0
she said : ' one letter was posted to me on the 27th and arrived on the 4th			0
my hospital appointment was on the 3rd			0
it 's not good enough			0
' neighbour @entity102 , 41 , said : ' me and my partner both work night shifts so it 's hard enough to get to the delivery office			0
i feel like we 're being unfairly punished			0
the dog does n't even live on this street			2
' i do n't understand why they ca n't put the post in the @entity114 post office and that would save the whole community going to @entity47 all the time			0
' a court ordered that @entity16 's @entity14 bulldog ( pictured ) must be accompanied , muzzled , and kept on two leads when in public @entity121 , 75 , whose husband @entity122 died last year , said she found it difficult frequently getting taxis to and from the mail depot			1
she said : ' the cost of going to the sorting office is something i could do without			0
there have been @entity131 cards missing too			0
' i have a lot of hospital appointments and sometimes i wo n't know when they are until the last minute			0
' @entity23 and @entity24 , who live in @entity8 near the junction with @entity26 , said they had heard little from @entity2 by way of explanation			1
mr @entity24 said : ' luckily we can do our appointments by email , but not everyone can do that			0
my wife is disabled and it 's not right that our street is still being excluded			0
' councillor @entity147 , who represents @entity148 with @entity149 , said he felt sorry for all parties involved			0
he said : ' i sympathise with both sides , with @entity2 and with the residents because it is now so long since they have had mail delivered			1
' i also have sympathies with @entity155 as they have tried their best to resolve it			0
' it has gone on for too long now and there has to be a resolution			0
' the @entity2 has said it had decided on areas where deliveries would not take place based on reported sightings of the animal			1
spokesperson @entity165 said : ' @entity2 can confirm that we are continuing with the temporary suspension of deliveries to a number of addresses in the @entity26 area of @entity9 , while concern for our postmen 's safety continues , with the dog which attacked two of our postmen earlier this year still being allowed to roam freely on occasion while our postmen are out on delivery			1
' in a recent incident on december 18 , following restoration of deliveries to several addresses in september , our postman had to seek shelter when the dog , unattended and without a muzzle , tried to attack the postman			1
' suspending deliveries is always a last resort but we take the health and safety of our employees very seriously and we have reported this latest incident to the police and local dog warden			2
' we apologise to all affected customers and we want to resolve this situation as quickly as possible			0
