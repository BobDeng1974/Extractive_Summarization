but from such modest beginnings did one giant success story grow , and now @entity10 ' ' mummy porn ' trilogy @entity6 is raking in over $ 1 million ( approximately £ 862,069 ) for the @entity12 author every week			1
phenomenon : @entity10 ' trilogy is selling unusually well in ebook format - perhaps because people are embarrassed to be reading the racy books in public @entity6 is an erotic story about a recent female college graduate who is seduced and dominated by a billionaire businessman			1
the books were initially popular with bored housewives but are now exploding on to the mainstream , shattering sales records in 37 countries and being translated into dozens of languages			2
there ’s even a movie deal in the works			0
having been published just four months ago , the combined total global sales of @entity10 ' trilogy is already 20 million			1
just one month ago the sales total was at 16 million , meaning the books are now selling at a colossal rate of one million paperbacks and ebooks per week			1
@entity36 estimates that mother - of - two @entity10 , whose real name is @entity10 , must be making $ 1.34m ( £ 862,069 ) every week : ' it ’s safe to assume that @entity10 has long ago sold enough copies to repay her seven figure book advance , which means at this point she is earning the standard seven per cent royalty on every $ 14 ( £ 9 ) paperback and 25 per cent royalty on every $ 10 ( £ 6.40 ) ebook			1
' in the last month , @entity46 has sold four million paperbacks and one million ebooks , which equates to $ 2.94m ( £ 1.89m ) in paperback royalties and $ 2.497m ( £ 1.6m ) in ebook royalties			1
in other words $ 5.4m ( £ 3.47m ) in four weeks , $ 1.35m ( £ 868,502 ) per week ! ' modest beginnings : fifty @entity53 was orinigally twilight fan fiction which @entity55 gave away for free @entity46 has also just been paid $ 5m ( £ 3.2m ) from @entity57 / @entity56 for the film rights to the trilogy , so it really has been quite some year			2
@entity46 , originally a self - published @entity61 author , saw popularity of her book soar online after readers embarrassed to be seen with a hard copy of the racy tome preferred to buy online			0
the @entity61 edition of ‘ @entity6 ’ is currently outselling the print book at a rate of more than two to one			0
sales of the book , the first in a trilogy , have overtaken the @entity75 books and the @entity76 , to the delight of not only @entity46 , but established romance writer @entity78			2
@entity78 yesterday credited @entity46 with reviving interest in the flagging ' bonkbuster ' genre , saying : ' @entity82 was terribly out of fashion before that book came out			0
' while i have heard that it is quite poorly written , i am delighted that it ’s giving a new lease of life to the genre			0
' @entity6 writer @entity46 has said she thinks her books are successful because they offer women a ' holiday from their husbands ' .			0
