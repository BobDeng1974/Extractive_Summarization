in the early 1930s , scientists were fairly confident they understood subatomic physics			1
that was until dozens of new elementary particles were discovered in the 1950s , forcing scientists to rewrite their models			1
now a new particle , first detected in 2007 but not confirmed until now , could send them back to the drawing board as they try to figure out what ’s going on at a subatomic level			1
confirmation of a new ' exotic hadron ' by the @entity14 beauty ( @entity15 , pictured ) experiment at @entity17 in @entity18 could require scientists to rewrite their current models of subatomic physics this particular discovery delves into a particularly complex branch of physics			1
it was made by physicists at the @entity14 beauty ( @entity15 ) collaboration at @entity17 in @entity27 , @entity18			1
@entity15 is a multinational experiment designed to identify new forces and particles in the universe			1
the finding confirms the discovery of a so - called ‘ exotic hadron			1
’ atoms are usually made of protons , neutrons and electrons these are made of even smaller elementary particles			0
elementary particles , also known as fundamental particles , are the smallest particles we know to exist			0
they are subdivided into two groups , the first being fermions , which are said to be the particles that make up matter			0
the second are bosons , the force particles that hold the others together			0
within the group of fermions are subatomic particles known as quarks			0
when quarks combine in threes , they form compound particles known as baryons			0
protons are probably the best - known baryons			0
sometimes , quarks interact with corresponding anti-particles ( such as anti-quarks ) , which have the same mass but opposite charges			0
when this happens , they form mesons			0
mesons often turn up in the decay of heavy man - made particles , such as those in particle accelerators , nuclear reactors and cosmic rays			2
mesons , baryons , and other kinds of particles that take part in interactions like these are called hadrons			0
these are types of matter that can not be classified within the traditional quark model that is currently used			2
previously it was thought that quarks - subatomic elementary particles - could not occur in groups of more than three this classification remained virtually unchallenged until 2007 , when an international team of 400 physicists and engineers , known as the @entity97 , discovered an exotic particle called z ( 4430 ) , which appeared to have two quarks and two anti-quarks			1
the discovery of a particle made essentially of four quarks does not fit with our current model of physics			1
until now the discovery of @entity108 ( 4430 ) in 2007 was highly controversial , with physicists divided on whether it could exist or not			1
the recent confirmation of the particle using the @entity15 proves beyond any reasonable doubt that it exists			1
‘ we 've confirmed the unambiguous observation of a very exotic state — something that looks like a particle composed of two quarks and two anti-quarks , ’ says @entity115 , a specialist in experimental high - energy physics and one of the lead authors on the new paper detailing the discovery			1
‘ the discovery certainly does n't fit the traditional quark model			1
‘ it may give us a new way of looking at strong - interaction physics			2
’ the discovery of a four - quark hadron was first hinted at in 2007 but it was not until recently that an international team from @entity17 was able to confirm the discovery beyond reasonable doubt the @entity14 accelerator at @entity17 has seven particle physics detect experiments , including @entity15 ( pictured ) , that are studying physics at a subatomic level subatomic particles can be largely classified in two groups : fermions , which include quarks and leptons , are those that make up matter , while bosons are said to be the ' force ' particles quarks are elementary particles , the smallest particles we know to exist			1
when they combine they form compound particles known as hadrons			0
quarks are said to have six ‘ flavours ’ : up , down , @entity162 , @entity163 , @entity164			0
combinations of quarks within these flavours gives rise to the ‘ larger ’ particles			0
groups of three quarks are known as baryons			0
an example of a baryon is a proton , which is made of two ' up ' quarks and a ' @entity178 ' quark			2
one of the most significant consequences of this discovery is that it may question our understanding of neutron stars			2
previously it was thought that neutron stars , as their name implies , are made solely of neutrons			2
the discovery of a four - quark hadron , known as a tetraquark , challenges that theory			1
neutron stars , the remnants of supernovas , are the densest stellar objects known to exist with masses several times greater than the sun squashed into a city - sized area			2
under these extreme conditions , it could be possible for neutrons to create tetraquarks			0
this would require a new classification of star known as a quark star			1
in turn , this would require our current theories for the interiors of neutron stars to be re-examined			0
and it may just be one consequence of this discovery			0
ultimately , our models and assumptions of subatomic physics may need to be re-evaluated .			2

scientists at @entity17 have confirmed the existence of a new ' exotic ' particle
international team used the @entity14 beauty ( @entity15 ) detector
the particle was first detected in 2007 but it has only now been confirmed
*dubbed* z ( 4430 ) , the discovery challenges existing models of physics
it may also indicate that a new type of neutron star , a quark star , exists
