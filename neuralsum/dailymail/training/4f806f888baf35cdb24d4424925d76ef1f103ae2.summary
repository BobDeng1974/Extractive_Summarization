by @entity0 huge wigs , lashings of glitter and one very prominent beard , it can only mean one thing : @entity7 is back with a vengeance			1
and this year , the line - up is more dazzling than ever before , with @entity11 winner @entity10 , sir @entity12 , 75 , @entity13 , 50 , and , of course , plenty of drag queens , all on the bill			1
thanks to @entity10 's triumph , the success of @entity24 's @entity23 and the popularity of @entity27 's reality tv series , @entity28 of @entity29 , the drag scene has enjoyed an upswing in interest in recent months			1
but while she 's enjoying her new found popularity and soaring success , miss @entity38 says her career was n't handed to her on a plate			2
' i 've been in the business professionally for about 25 years , ' she explains			0
' it started with me just dressing up for @entity59 and then i started in the industry by standing on the door of clubs and ripping up tickets			2
' she is now one of @entity37 's biggest names , and her reputation has seen her become a mentor to young aspiring drag queens - although @entity38 herself says she still ca n't understand the hype			1
' i ca n't deny that i am [ a mentor ] but i 'm not very comfortable with that , ' she confesses			0
' i think it 's because i 'm highly visible , @entity29 has a very small drag scene - everyone always thinks it 's bigger than it is - and i have been in it a long time so people do look to me for advice			1
' people think i am more high - profile and more successful than i actually am - and certainly more than what my bank balance is telling me ! ' @entity38 helps to judge @entity82 at madame @entity83 's , a drag competition that helps uncover new talent			1
but not every drag queen is created equal			1
according to miss @entity38 , drag comes in many forms and reveals that the only way to make it is by putting the effort in			1
' i always say have fun , be who you want to be , learn from your mistakes and dress up up up ! if you 're a professional , you have to really hone your craft			0
@entity38 ( centre ) took part in @entity27 's reality tv show , @entity28 of @entity29 ' people always ask me : " how do i become a great @entity103 ? " and i always say : " do it ! " you have to just get out there			1
' it 's no good sitting at home in front of the mirror drawing an eyebrow on			0
it 's like any other art - you have to practise it			2
' miss @entity38 's image has certainly changed over the years , starting with a penchant for the @entity115 and her current incarnation : huge ball gowns and plenty of make - up			2
@entity38 will be hosting the main stage at @entity7 tomorrow a big character who is not afraid to ruffle the odd feather , miss @entity38 has had her fair share of showdowns , including one with fellow drag queen @entity125 who claimed @entity38 had humiliated her			1
' i 'm different from other drag queens in the way that i do n't adopt a character , ' adds miss @entity38			2
' @entity38 is me , i spend a lot of my time in drag when i host , so i ca n't pretend to be someone else			2
' the name @entity38 came from my nickname as a child , everyone else liked @entity138 and i liked @entity40			0
' @entity38 used to be my name of torture at school but now look where it 's got me			0
all of those bullies are in council houses with five children and i 'm not ! ' miss @entity38 has more than 5,000 followers on @entity148 and 750 @entity150 fans - with social media , according to the veteran , why the drag scene is becoming more accepted			1
' there was a real resurgence in the 90s , and i think we 're starting to see one now too , ' she adds			0
' social media means it 's easy to access , everyone everywhere knows everyone else 's business and videos are getting 100,000 hits on @entity166			0
' but while the ensembles worn by @entity38 and her fellow drag queens might look bizarre to the uninitiated , @entity38 says it has been around for longer than you might think			0
' there has always been an alternative drag scene , ' she explains			1
' it is becoming a bit more mainstream with @entity10 winning @entity178 but there have always been people pushing boundaries			0
' @entity7 is more relevant now than it ever has been			2
it reminds us of how lucky we actually are especially when there are people being stoned to death for being gay			0
' ' there do tend to be fewer people strutting around in feather boas singing : " @entity194 " , but the recent hype around drag is nothing we have n't seen before , it is n't revolutionary			0
' tomorrow , she will take part in @entity197 - an annual event that sees thousands of people descend on @entity51 in @entity29			1
' pride is more relevant now than it ever has been , ' adds miss @entity38			0
' it reminds us of how lucky we actually are especially when there are people being stoned to death for being gay			0
' when people question why we still need @entity7 i always say : " it 's one day a year ! " we have heterosexuality shoved in our face everyday and this is n't harming anyone			1
' at the end of the day it 's a party and it puts a smile on people 's faces			0
