@entity0 should not even be here			1
her tiny , birdlike body should still be safely encased in her mother ’s womb , 36 weeks into the gestation process , 18 - inches long and gaining the weight she needs to thrive			1
instead , she is officially three months old , weighs just 4lb 8oz , and is alive only thanks to a supermarket sandwich bag that replicated the warmth and safety of her mother ’s body			1
weighing little more than 1lb and born 16 weeks before her due date , @entity0 is one of @entity14 ’s youngest surviving premature babies			1
@entity15 cuddles her daughter @entity0 who was born 16 week premature			1
born that early , babies are deemed ' on the edge of life ' , and less than half survive pictured this week clinging to her mother ’s finger , @entity0 ’s battle for life touched the hearts of anyone who saw it			1
and now @entity28 can reveal the incredible technique that doctors used to save @entity0 ’s fragile life – and her mother ’s own devastating account of watching her daughter struggle to survive			1
her fight for life has astounded medics at the @entity38 of @entity39 who delivered her			2
the instant @entity0 was born , doctors delicately placed her inside a resealable plastic bag , identical to those sold in supermarkets			1
it was an ingenious measure			2
‘ the bag acts as a micro environment , ’ explains consultant paediatrician dr @entity46			1
‘ at this age she was too tiny for an incubator , which is designed for full - term babies			2
’ this week her exhausted but exhilarated parents , @entity15 and @entity54 , were given the news that on june 16 , the day she was due to be born , little @entity0 will finally be allowed home			1
cradling her daughter , @entity57 , 34 , said yesterday : ‘ it ’s been an emotional journey			1
our world has been turned upside - down and what should have been every new parent ’s happiest moment became our worst nightmare , delivering our beautiful daughter at 24 weeks			1
’ latest @entity14 statistics show that babies born at 24 weeks have between a 42 - 46 per cent survival rate			1
they are highly susceptible to losing body heat , so hospitals are putting them into sandwich bags to stave off death from hypothermia			0
ms @entity0 , a former care assistant who lives in @entity76 in the @entity77 , added : ‘ @entity0 ’s finally out of the woods			1
' it ’s such a relief after everything we ’ve been through			0
my little lady is on a roll now and there ’s no stopping her			0
’ here , in her own words , @entity57 , who has three older daughters , @entity88 , eight , @entity89 , four , and @entity90 , 17 months , with long - term partner @entity54 , 47 , describes the traumatic moments leading up to @entity0 ’s birth on february 27 and the desperate battle to save her life			1
to this day , i will never know why i went into labour early , throwing us into a nightmare			0
our much - wanted fourth child was supposed to arrive on june 16 but , instead , she had other plans			1
my waters broke without warning on sunday , february 23 , sending me into a state of panic			0
i was aware that babies born before 24 weeks , and so still within the legal abortion stage , are labelled on the ‘ edge of life ’ , as their lungs and other vital organs are not developed enough			1
as a result , not all hospitals are keen to intervene			0
i remember counting in fear , wondering what would happen if the baby was born that day			2
i now understand the despair that some parents must go through when their baby is born at 23 weeks or earlier and is allowed to die			1
it was with relief i counted she was exactly 24 weeks that day and at least my baby would be given a fighting chance , whatever was about to happen			1
a day earlier , and it might have been different			0
in the end , it would be another four days before @entity0 arrived on thursday , february 27 – the day before my birthday			1
i ’d been given a series of steroid injections on the day my waters broke , in an attempt to help accelerate the baby ’s lung development			0
but with no sign of contractions starting , i was allowed to return home to rest			2
it was a horrible waiting game , but when my contractions finally came , everything happened terrifyingly quickly			0
we ’d known that @entity0 was in the breech position , and by the time we reached the hospital 50 miles away one of her feet was sticking out			1
incredibly , they delivered @entity0 one - and - a - half minutes after we arrived in the labour suite			1
to all intents and purposes , it was a ‘ normal ’ birth , except my baby was coming far too early			2
but there she was , my little @entity152 , weighing just 1lb 3oz , and our lives would never be the same again			1
' she was put into a sandwich bag straight away			2
it 's like a little insulation jacket that helps them maintain body temperature because they lack the body fat to stay warm ' to my surprise , she was put into a sandwich bag straight away			1
it was just like any one you would get in a supermarket			0
but it apparently simulates the protective environment they ’ve just come out of			1
it ’s like a little insulation jacket that helps them maintain body temperature because they lack the body fat to stay warm			2
i did n’t have time to see her or touch her before she was taken away to the neonatal intensive care unit			0
i was sick with worry , not knowing if she would live or die			0
it would be an hour before i saw my daughter for the first time – and instead of that feeling of instant , overwhelming love , i felt panic and horror that she was so small			0
surrounded by tubes and on a ventilator , i prayed she would be ok			0
but it was impossible for anyone to know what would happen next			0
the medical staff did n’t give us a prognosis and we did n’t dare ask the question , ‘ how long will she live ? ’ i saw her for 20 minutes before i was taken back to the maternity ward and put into a side room			0
i could hear the happy sounds of other mums with their babies all around me			0
the next day i managed to see @entity0 around lunchtime			1
seeing her lying there was every mother ’s worst nightmare			2
her skin was transparent , her eyes were fused shut and her little hands and feet were still webbed			0
we could n’t touch her and spent hours sitting by her incubator			0
as she made it through the first 24 hours , then the first week , we began to allow ourselves to think that she might pull through			2
by two weeks , @entity0 had already needed two blood transfusions			1
still nervous , we decided to have her baptised , in case the worst happened			0
it was a beautiful service , carried out at the side of her incubator			0
and still @entity0 fought on			1
as the days passed , everyone kept saying to us , ‘ that ’s her through the danger point			0
’ but that ’s not always the case with premature babies			0
it ’s not unusual for their little bodies to become tired at three weeks and they die			2
i was allowed home but i slept beside the phone with my clothes on , in case the call came to say she was deteriorating			2
@entity0 would be one month old before i could finally hold her – a moment which coincided with @entity239 and proved the perfect present			2
' we are incredibly proud and in love with her			0
her strength and determination are nothing short of amazing ' she ’d finally opened her eyes and i was getting to hold her for the first time			0
i enjoyed the wonderful moment i never thought i would see			0
it was an absolutely amazing feeling			0
by six weeks , @entity0 still remained in an incubator but her weight was up to 2lb 5oz and she could be dressed for the first time			1
i could see small but significant changes as her tiny hands and feet developed properly			0
her condition continued to improve so much that , by nine weeks , @entity0 was finally transferred to @entity255 , just half an hour from our home			1
but we were brought down to earth with a bump again soon afterwards and reminded how long the road ahead of us is when @entity0 ’s consultant told us she has a heart murmur that will require surgery at some point in the future			1
the reality of being born at 24 weeks is starting to kick in			1
the worry of long - term effects and wondering what the future holds for @entity0 is frightening			2
but , ten days ago , in another first , i was able to bottle - feed @entity0 and , last weekend , give her a bath			2
those were beautiful moments most mothers take for granted , but after fighting for so long to keep her alive , it was a very precious time for me			2
slowly , the equipment has disappeared from my daughter ’s room and she is now in a cot , rather than an incubator			0
it ’s very scary seeing it go and will take a bit of getting used to			0
we are incredibly proud and in love with her			0
her strength and determination are nothing short of amazing			0
she has fought amazingly hard to stay with us .			0

@entity0 was born at just 24 weeks old , weighing little over 1lb
doctors placed her in a resealable plastic bag after birth to keep her alive
