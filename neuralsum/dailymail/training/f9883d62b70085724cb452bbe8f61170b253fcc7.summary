by @entity0 published : 12:44 est , 18 december 2012 updated : 02:48 est , 19 december 2012 a @entity3 @entity2 candidate has sparked outrage by calling for discussion on whether unborn babies with @entity8 's syndrome or spina bifida should be compulsorily aborted			1
@entity10 , who will stand for @entity2 in @entity12 elections , has come under fire over his personal ' manifesto ' which holds controversial views on disabled people , @entity17 and immigration			1
mr @entity10 , who is also standing for @entity19 in a by - election on thursday , called for a @entity22 review into @entity24 expenditure on his website			1
the review should 're - examine the pregnancy abortion time limit			2
consider compulsory abortion when the foetus is detected as having @entity29 , spina bifida or similar syndrome which , if it is born , will render the child a burden on the state as well as on the family '			0
a local @entity38 candidate ( not pictured ) has come under fire over his personal ' manifesto ' which seems to hold controversial views on disabled people , @entity17 and immigration			1
the party , led by @entity42 ( pictured ) has condemned the statements it should also look into medical treatment for people over the age of 80 , which the 66 - year - old says is ' extraordinarily costly ' to the @entity24			1
this row will come as an embarrassing blow to the party , as polls show support for @entity2 at a record high of between seven per cent and 14 per cent of the vote			1
but mr @entity10 said that he does not actually endorse the provocative statements on his website			1
' i do not endorse these ideas , ' he said later			2
the views expressed by @entity10 are a horrific reminder of the science of eugenics			1
it advocated the use of practices which aim at improving the genetic make - up of a population , generally a human population			2
people who believe in @entity62 advocate for the improvement of human hereditary traits through the promotion of higher reproduction of more desired people			0
a reduction in reproduction of less desired people and traits is encouraged			0
@entity62 was at its most popular in the early decades of the @entity80			0
it was practiced around the world , with governments , influential institutions and individuals promoting it			0
a number of countries introduced eugenics policies and programs which included genetic screening , birth control and marriage restrictions			2
those targeted included the poor , mentally ill , disabled or promiscuous women			0
in some cases entire racial groups were targeted			0
an extreme case of this was the mass extermination of @entity100 by @entity101			0
eugenics was largely abandoned by the end of @entity104			0
' they are for the commission to consider how best to cut service levels if it is decided to do so			0
' learning disability charity @entity107 questioned whether the candidate is fit for office after he made the comments on his website			1
chief executive @entity112 said : ' @entity107 is disgusted and horrified by the manifesto of @entity38 candidate @entity10 who has proposed the compulsory abortion of any foetus with @entity8 's syndrome or spina bifida			1
' much has been written about the @entity118 this summer changing attitudes towards disabled people for the better			0
yet in the very same year , a council candidate has proposed forced eugenics against disabled people			2
' it is abhorrent that @entity10 sees disabled people solely as a burden when people with a learning disability lead full lives and make valuable contributions to their communities and families			2
we question if he is fit for public office			0
' in his manifesto , mr @entity10 also says same - sex marriage is an ' abhorrence '			1
population , immigration and threats to @entity3 's green belt are the three issues closest to his heart			2
a @entity2 spokesman said they had now suspended mr @entity10 and if he was successful in the election he would not be representing them			1
he said : ' this is a personal manifesto			1
it is more of a shock to us than to anyone			0
' he has now been suspended and will not be representing us in the unlikely event that he wins			0

@entity10 , who will stand in @entity12 elections , also appears to have controversial views on @entity17 and immigration
he *labels* same - sex marriage an ' abhorrence ' in his personal manifesto
@entity2 , recently *enjoying* a popularity high , confirmed it has now suspended the candidate
mr @entity10 said he does not ' endorse statements on his website ' but they were for consideration
