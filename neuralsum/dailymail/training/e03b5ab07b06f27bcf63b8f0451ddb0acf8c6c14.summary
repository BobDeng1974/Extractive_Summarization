@entity13 - divorced , 65 - year - old grandmother @entity26 ¿ @entity27 spent more than 30 years working as a boxing judge before walking away from the sport she loved late last year her first professional fight was in @entity31 in 1992 and when her third husband ’s job moved them to @entity25 not long after , it provided her with the perfect opportunity to work more fights with better fighters in the boxing - mad city			1
@entity27 was assigned her first title fight in 1999 and by 2012 had worked nearly 500 fights over 20 years including at least 65 bouts competing for a championship belt			1

@entity27 was asked to judge a @entity50 welterweight title bout between @entity52 champ @entity51 and @entity54 challenger @entity53 at @entity25 ' @entity55			1
@entity51 , the only fighter in the sport ’s history to win world titles in eight divisions was heavy favorite , while @entity53 was a 7 - 2 underdog			1
@entity27 was hounded by the boxing press and via fans on social media sites for her controversial scoring of the june 2012 fight between @entity53 , right , and @entity51 , left the fight went the distance and the pundits were all agreed that @entity51 appeared to have done more than enough to win despite slowing in the later stages			1
instead @entity51 famously lost his belt to @entity53 after a controversial split decision			1
everyone was left stunned after two of the judges – including @entity27 - scored the bout 115 - 113 to the unbeaten @entity53 , while the other handed the win to @entity51 by the same score			1
the fallout was harsh for @entity27			2

@entity103 said ' what the f * * k is this ? ' in the ring after the announcer read @entity27 ' , far right , scorecard boxing is a sport beset by stories of mob involvement and gambling through the years			1
questions were asked of the apparently bizarre decisions of the judges , but no evidence was ever found that @entity27 was on the take			2
in fact , @entity120 , president of @entity50 , told @entity44 that @entity27 ‘ was very professional and she was very good			2
’ in spite of the uproar that surrounded @entity27 ’ decision , she returned to the ringside and over the next 15 months , she judged 37 fights , 10 of them with a championship at stake			2
the came the fight that was to finish of her career once and for all			0
in sept 14 , 2013 , she was assigned a championship bout between @entity103 - boxing ’s biggest draw and the world ’s highest - paid athlete in the world - and undefeated challenger @entity140			1
again the match went the distance , but this time @entity27 was on her own in scoring it as a draw , while the other two judges - and most observers - had judged it a decisive win for @entity103			1
no sooner was her scoring made public , than a tidal wave of vitriol was unleashed upon @entity27			1
@entity51 of the @entity52 , left , defeated @entity53 , right , in a recent rematch of their @entity50 welterweight title match the fighter himself could n't contain his dismay at @entity27 ’ decision			1
‘ what the f * * k is this ? ’ he said in the ring after the announcer read @entity27 ’ scorecard			2
@entity140 himself said , ' i recognize that he beat me			2
' @entity140 ’s promoter , @entity168 of @entity169 , called @entity27 ’ scorecard a ' disgrace			1
' @entity172 analyst @entity171 raised the question that perhaps foul play was to blame			0
‘ that criminal , that corrupt … incompetent , whatever you want to call her , ’ he told @entity175			0
‘ this is the second time she ’s done this			0
’ ‘ it speaks to the corruption of the sport , ’ he continued			0
‘ the criminals will be rewarded			0
’ two days later , @entity27 sent an email to the @entity187 informing them that she planned to leave the sport indefinitely			2
' i will be taking some time off from boxing but will keep in touch , ' she wrote			2
a friend claims that @entity27 was victimized because she was a woman working in a male - dominated profession again no evidence has ever been uncovered that lends any credibility to @entity200 ’ comments			1
since quitting the sport , @entity27 has been spending time at her modest home in @entity204 , @entity17 , where she moved after her third marriage ended in divorce in 2004			1
she had been engaged to be married before her fiancé suddenly died in 2009			0
' what money ? ' she asked , when interviewed by @entity44			0
' where ’s this trail of money at ? there is n’t enough to pay me off , even if it was millions			0
' ' i was pretty disgusted by the whole thing , ' said @entity216 , a close friend			0
' they were just piling on			0
and i think it ’s totally because she ’s a woman			0
' shortly after the @entity103 debacle , she was also laid off from her job leading a workout class at a local gym			2
@entity27 , who enjoys wide - open spaces and outdoor activities , now spends most of her time alone with nothing to do in the wilderness			1
' i think i ’m getting tired of the desert , ' she told @entity44			0
' i ’m going crazy here			0

@entity231 spent more than 30 years working as a boxing judge before quitting late last year
she resigned in the face of growing *criticism* about her scoring of a bout between @entity103 and @entity140 ' @entity140 ' @entity140
her scoring of the match was labelled a disgrace and some pundits questioned if she had taken a bribe
a year earlier she had faced *similar* *accusations* after @entity51 *'s* defeat at the hands of @entity53
@entity27 denies taking bribes and the thrice - divorced , 65 - year - old grandmother , currently lives on her own in the @entity17 desert
a friend claims that @entity27 was victimized because she was a woman working in a male - dominated profession
