published : 11:31 est , 26 january 2014 @entity1 : 07:05 est , 5 february 2014 these adorable pictures show the moment a baby liliger play fights with its ' mother ' - a domestic cat called @entity7 @entity8 - a new hybrid cross between a male lion and a ligress - was born at @entity11 in @entity12			1
but when her mother stopped producing milk , staff at the zoo had to nurse her , hand - feeding her a bottle of milk every three hours around the clock			1
dedicated keeper @entity20 , 40 , decided to take on the unique but challenging task , taking @entity23 home with her where she struck up an immediate friendship with her pet cat , @entity26			1
pictured playing and nuzzling together , the two formed an extraordinary bond and were rarely seen apart			0
however , it was n't long before the mini mammal began displaying more predatory behaviour , a sign it was time to return her mother			0
head keeper @entity20 said : ' @entity60 , the cub 's mother was a caring parent but as soon as @entity8 was born we noticed she had stopped producing milk			1
' the bond between a mother and a new born cub is extremely important and we try to keep them together wherever possible but in this case we had to take drastic measures			2
motherly figure : @entity7 has a kitten of her own , so took @entity8 under her wing growing up fast : @entity7 has the upper hand during a play fight with the @entity75 animal instincts : but when @entity8 was big enough to start eating meat , her predator instincts started to kick in ' as soon as i introduced @entity8 to my house cat @entity26 , the pair just clicked			1
' @entity7 's motherly instincts took over and she began to treat @entity75 as one of her offspring , licking her and always making sure she was warm , it was beautiful to see			2
' @entity87 at home would be every cat lovers dream i would imagine but its a very serious task and requires complete dedication , but i have to say it was very fun at times			0
' after one week we started introducing meat to the cub and then suddenly she started looking like more of a predator than a pet , we knew it was time to give @entity8 back to her mother			2
' we were worried about reintroducing the cub to her mother because of the time apart but thankfully the two are doing just fine			0
' of course both me and @entity7 miss @entity75 , but it makes me much happier to see her with her mother where she belongs			0
' adorable : but while @entity75 may look cuddly , she 's still a dangerous predator @entity108 was taken back to the zoo where she was successfully re-introduced to her mother			0

@entity8 - a new hybrid cross between a male lion and a ligress - was born at @entity11 in @entity12
but soon after her birth , @entity8 's mother @entity60 stopped producing milk
keeper @entity20 *agreed* to take the cub home so she could be fed round the clock
it was there she formed a special bond with @entity20 's pet cat called @entity7
the pair were inseparable until @entity8 had to be returned to her real mother
