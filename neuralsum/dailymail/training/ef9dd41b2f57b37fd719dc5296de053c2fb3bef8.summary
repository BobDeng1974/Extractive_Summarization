by @entity0 for the @entity1 follow @ @ samcunningham the top tier of @entity3 will be closed for the first time at an @entity6 game because of the poor crowd expected for wednesday ’s friendly against @entity8			1
the @entity9 expect between 35,000 and 40,000 — less than half the 90,000 capacity			1
that would make it the lowest attendance since the new stadium opened in 2007			2
the previous lowest was in november 2011 when 48,876 turned up for a friendly against @entity16			0
but the fans have voted with their feet in the wake of a diabolical performance at the @entity26 — @entity6 ’s worst in a finals since 1958			1
@entity6 ’s new captain @entity17 insists the figures are still promising considering events in @entity36			1
he said : ‘ it is lower than normal , but still 40,000 or so , which is great considering the disappointment at the @entity26			1
‘ we ’re always grateful to the fans , their support is second to none			0
hopefully we can repay them with some good performances and exciting , attractive football to qualify for @entity46			0
that starts when we play @entity8			2
’ opposition : @entity8 train at @entity3 on tuesday ahead of the international friendly @entity6 manager @entity23 added : ‘ we ca n’t turn back the clock , we ca n’t play @entity52 and @entity53 again			1
we can only play the game against @entity8			2
' we are desperate to entertain the crowd who turn up			0
we ’ve played matches against opponents who will not pull crowds in — @entity59 , @entity60 — in the last few years and had fantastic support			0
' we had a group of fans in @entity36 who were fantastic			0
we ’re happy with 40,000			0
’ preparation : @entity6 begin their road to @entity46 after a disappointing @entity26 loosen up : @entity6 trained at @entity66 on monday ahead of the friendly @entity23 also responded to claims by @entity8 defender @entity69 , who lasted only six months at @entity70 and failed to play due to a lack of fitness , that @entity17 ‘ looks a bit chubby ’			1
