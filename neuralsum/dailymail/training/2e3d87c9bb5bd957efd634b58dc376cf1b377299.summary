@entity3 workers have been ' displaced ' from the jobs market by migrant workers – especially during the recession , a controversial @entity1 study claims			1
a fierce row has broken out inside the @entity8 over a @entity10 report on the economic impact of mass migration			1
newsnight on @entity14 claimed on tuesday that the still - unpublished document would undermine the @entity17 's case for imposing stricter controls on workers from overseas			1
migrant influx : @entity21 job - seekers board a coach in @entity23 bound for a new life in @entity3 @entity25 said that , as a result , it was being ' suppressed ' by @entity27 – with pro-immigration @entity29 mps demanding its immediate publication			1
but the @entity32 now understands that the study – written by civil servants in the @entity35 , @entity36 and @entity37 – will clearly state that some @entity3 have suffered ' displacement ' from the jobs market			1
it says this has been particularly noticeable for ' low - skilled natives ' , especially during the last recession			0
last night , the row led to renewed claims of the @entity14 having an ' habitual lack of impartiality on the subject of immigration '			1
its own executives have repeatedly admitted to the corporation that they had a pro-immigration , liberal bias in the past – but insist that has now changed			0
the dispute centres on two studies on the impact of immigration			2
the first was published in 2012 by the independent @entity61 , which was established by the last @entity63 government and is run by the respected economist sir @entity64			0
the second , unpublished , report was commissioned by the @entity10 two years ago as part of @entity69 's @entity68 ' balance of competences ' review			1
despite being focused on @entity73 , the @entity1 study also deals more broadly with the impact of migration on the jobs market			0
( file picture ) @entity13 on @entity14 claimed on tuesday that the still - unpublished document would undermine the @entity17 's case for imposing stricter controls on the row led to renewed claims of the @entity14 having an ' habitual lack of impartiality on the subject of immigration ' the @entity61 report found that for every 100 extra foreign - born working - age migrants in the @entity3 , there was a reduction of 23 in the number of @entity3 in employment			1
the report added that , between 2005 and 2010 , 160,000 people in the @entity3 had been ' displaced ' , or left jobless , by the influx of foreign workers			1
in a broadcast on tuesday evening , @entity13 reporter @entity97 said of this research : ' there 's just one problem : it 's wrong			1
' he said the government 's own unpublished report would contradict @entity61 's findings , and that it was being suppressed as a result			2
but as the @entity25 's own political editor @entity110 conceded yesterday , the government 's study deals with a different time period to @entity61 and the two are ' not directly comparable '			0
@entity61 's report covers the period to 2010			0
@entity1 's report brings the subject up to date			0
since 2010 , restrictions on @entity119 migration introduced by the government have led to an increase in the number of @entity3 workers getting jobs			2
@entity3 nationals accounted for 92 per cent of the total rise in employment in the year to july - september 2013			2
under @entity63 , the lion 's share went to foreign - born workers			0
insiders suggest that , far from undermining the case for immigration controls , it suggests the new regime is working			0
in any event , the government 's report – due to be published ' shortly ' – does confirm the ' displacement ' of @entity3 workers by mass migration , particularly the less well - off			1
as well as running on @entity13 , the immigration story dominated early @entity14 news bulletins yesterday			1
@entity143 's flagship today programme highlighted the story in a discussion between presenter @entity146 and the @entity14 's political editor @entity110			0
sir @entity148 of @entity149 said : ' the @entity14 's enthusiasm for anything that might undermine the government 's immigration policy was demonstrated yet again by the excitable tone of @entity13 's report			1
' he said the programme had claimed the new report ' undermined the government 's case for restricting immigration			2
' writing for the @entity162 magazine , he added : ' in fact , this is only one aspect of a much wider case concerning the impact of mass immigration on public services , housing and transport – not to speak of the social impact			0
' the row comes at a time of high @entity8 tensions over migration policy			2
@entity177 dem business secretary @entity176 said figures that show net migration rose by a third to 212,000 in the year to september 2013 was ' good news '			0
in @entity1 , the finger of blame for the selective leak to @entity13 was being aimed at the @entity184			2
@entity186 's spokesman said the @entity1 report was not yet complete but would be published ' shortly ' – possibly by may			0
asked whether the @entity189 thought it right now to drop his ambition to reduce annual net migration below 100,000 , the spokesman said : ' no. it is the objective which we are very much working towards			0
