mr @entity15 said : ' initially the concept for this project blew my mind a bit			2
' i knew how overwhelming the task could be but i felt confident with the right supporting staff and crew that we 'd get it done hard work : it took five days of preparation to secure the perfect image practice : the models had to hold their poses for hours while they were photographed so artist @entity15 knew where to paint them contorted : the painted models had to work together to form the shape of the car ' the process involving this was many days of preparation , pre organising the poses , mapping everything that would eventually come to be real and then working really long days to make them happen			1
' this project was certainly more than the typical ad , it became a work of art. ' the artist uses paint designed for safe use on human skin and has painted around 400 people in his career			1
