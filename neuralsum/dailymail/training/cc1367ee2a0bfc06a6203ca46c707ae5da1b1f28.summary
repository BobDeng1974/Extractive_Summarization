from the birth of @entity2 to the cover of @entity5 magazine , the naked human form has long been a source of artistic inspiration			0
now some of the best have been gathered together in a stunning new book , which draws on the extensive photo archive at the @entity11 in @entity12			1
edited by associate curatorm @entity15 , the nude in @entity14 includes 78 works , ranging from classic shots by the likes of @entity19 to the glossy modern nudes created by @entity22 artist , @entity21			1
knowing : @entity24 's 1856 nude nods to @entity26 's famous portrait of a prostitute , @entity28 iconic : @entity31 ' famous photo of nude supermodels , among them @entity29 and @entity33 but it 's not all photography			1
the book also contains images of classical @entity38 and @entity39 sculpture , the source of some of the world 's earliest nudes , as well as references to the likes of @entity47 's @entity46			2
much , however , focuses on the nude in photography and its surprisingly lengthy history , which began with the invention of the camera in the mid 1800s			1
indeed , according to historians , the history of photography actually pre-dates the invention of the camera , with camera obscura techniques used by the ancient @entity38			0
the first photograph of the sort modern viewers would recognise was a partially successful image taken in 1816 by @entity65 inventor , @entity64			0
@entity64 was also the first to create a box camera , using one , in 1826 , to photograph a 17th century @entity69 relief of a man using a horse			0

some of the most beautiful date from the early days of the art form , with 19th century masters such as @entity96 , @entity97 and @entity98 combining the new technology with classical composition			2
one especially lovely effort is @entity24 's 1856 nude which , with her knowing glance and draped couch , nods firmly to @entity26 's @entity28			0
more still are the work of 20th - century artists @entity19 , @entity108 and @entity109 , as well as innovative photographers @entity110 , @entity112 , and @entity113			2
the latter half of the 20th century is represented by the likes of @entity116 , @entity117 and @entity118 , and contemporary artists @entity120 , @entity121 , and @entity122			0
whether @entity21 's glossy technicolour shots or @entity24 's robust nudes , the beauty of the naked human form continues to fascinate and inspire photographers even to this day			0
