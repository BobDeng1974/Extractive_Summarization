recent strange events at an @entity2 restaurant have the owner and his employees spooked			1
@entity5 , owner of @entity6 and @entity8 ’s @entity7 , in @entity9 , enlisted the help of @entity11 to investigate a series of unexplained phenomena in the restaurant that started april 14			1
the first seemingly unexplained disturbance took place just before 6pm april 14			2
the store ’s security camera captures an amorphous shadow at the restaurant ’s dishwashing station that slowly forms into what looks like a person and drifts off screen			1
' ( employees ) have been saying they ’ve seen strange things ever since the place opened , and ( @entity42 ) blew it off until i saw the video , ' @entity5 told the @entity46			1
' it looks like it ’s coming out ( from underneath the cooler ) , goes across the floor and up over the dishwasher , ' @entity5 said			2
' but , you see , i ca n’t make a shadow here			0
i do n’t know what it is			0
' @entity5 acknowledged the figure could have been an insect on the camera lens			2
then , at about 10am april 19 , another security camera shows a stack of @entity62 cups sliding off a shelf and hitting a worker in the head , while another stack falls sideways as if it was pushed			0
another night , @entity5 was alone in the office doing paperwork when he heard a metal spatula fall to the ground , he said			2
' it was on the cooler at the end of kitchen , and i found it on the floor in the middle of the kitchen in front of the fryer , ' as if it had been flung across the room , @entity5 said			2
spirit or bug ? @entity5 admits the shadow could be a speck or a bug crawling across the camera normal day : a staff member was working close - by at the time the footage was captured and noticed nothing out of the ordinary not knowing what to make of the events , a manager typed ' ghost hunters ' into the web browser on his smartphone and pulled up @entity11			1
@entity97 , 30 , of @entity98 , and his team of paranormal investigators spent the early morning hours one day last month at the restaurant , recording audio , video and electromagnetic field readings and trying to re-create the shadow			1
among the devices they use to record paranormal activity is a ' ghost box , ' a modified portable radio that continuously scans @entity112 and @entity113 radio bands			2
when on , it is believed to create white noise and audio remnants from broadcast stations that entities are able to manipulate to create words and sentences			0
@entity97 said audio and video recording devices are portals for the supernatural to communicate			0
the team also tried to provoke activity by talking to the entity and placing flashlights on tables around the restaurant , asking the spirit to turn them off or on to respond to questions			0
@entity97 , an entrepreneur by day who is attempting to launch a cleaning service , said he and his team still are reviewing all the evidence collected and ca n’t say whether the restaurant might be haunted			1
he would not share what the team encountered during its investigation , saying @entity5 signed a confidentiality agreement preventing him from disclosing evidence gathered			1
fall or pushed ? a stack of cups falls onto a worker as she prepares food in the @entity7 in @entity9 odd : cups fell every which way as if they were pushed , says @entity5 @entity97 said the team also is researching the history of the property dating back to the 1800s to see what else has been on the land			2
@entity5 said the site was a vacant lot when he purchased it about five years ago , but he recalls seeing an old , undated photo that shows a building on the spot that sold ice - cream			1
at one point , the site also was home to a grocery store , tavern and feed store			0
behind the restaurant , across an alley , sits a house that was once a funeral home and next door was an ambulance garage , @entity5 said			1
@entity174 , @entity7 president and ceo , has not seen the tapes and is dubious of the paranormal research			0
' but @entity5 is a good operator , and if it creates some curiosity and interest around town and brings more people to his restaurant , that ’s ok , ' @entity174 said			1
' he ’s having some fun with it , which is fine			0
i chuckled when i first heard about it			0
i thought it was amusing			0
ca n’t say i ’ve heard of anything similar at other @entity7 locations			0
' @entity5 remains baffled by the disturbances and has named the supposed ghost @entity195 after his father , @entity6			1
' could it have been a bug on the camera lens causing the shadow ? i suppose , ' @entity5 said			1
' but i ca n’t explain the cups or the spatula			0
... what i do know is my four - year - old niece wo n’t come in the restaurant			1
fortunately , if it is a ghost , it ’s been a friendly one so far			0
