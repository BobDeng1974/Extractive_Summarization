by @entity0 @entity1 and former @entity2 boss @entity0 , a @entity3 columnist , gives his take on the key players as @entity6 prepare to take on @entity7 in their @entity9 opener in @entity10			1
@entity7 @entity11 this may be his fifth @entity3 but you can see he still has excellent quality with his hands and feet			1
he keeps his defence calm and his experience wins @entity7 games			2
a great character and good example for everyone to follow			2
shot stopper : @entity11 is a fine example to follow , at the age of 36 , he organises the defence well @entity26 he may be small but do n’t be fooled he is strong			1
a dynamic midfielder with great intelligence , @entity27 have questioned if he can play in the same team as @entity31 and a slight injury may prompt @entity33 to favour @entity34			2
stylish : but @entity26 may not get in the same team as charismatic playmaker @entity31 @entity36 very clever player who can make the difference in tight games			2
may come on from the bench but understands the game well and gets into positions to cause danger			0
has lost weight after cutting back on focaccia but still strong			2
key sub ? @entity36 can make an impact off the bench in crucial games @entity50 not had the best season but it ’s always the same with him ; he has great qualities and if he concentrates on his football he can be excellent			1
may be used by @entity33 as a target man to help give @entity7 ’s midfield the control			0
not the best season : but @entity50 can turn any game on its head @entity61 has just moved to @entity62 for £ 15m			1
a confident character and real worker who will chase lost causes and wo n’t let any defence rest			0
scored 22 goals last season and could play as a lone striker or in partnership with @entity50			1
poacher : serie a top scorer and new @entity62 striker @entity61 could link up with @entity50 @entity6 @entity73 we could see his potential at @entity76			1
has a great attitude , is willing to listen and has good feet			0
@entity79 experience will give him confidence and he can be an aerial threat			0
potential fulfilled : @entity73 is a fine listener and has two great feet at the back @entity84 his movement is very good			1
the main thing is how players like him grow ; how they manage the expectation from fans and press talking about how great they are			0
he finds good positions but has to be careful in possession			0
no fear : @entity84 's movement in behind the striker could mean an influential impact @entity99 i remember @entity2 ’s academy director @entity102 came to me and said ‘ we must sign this kid he has great potential ’			1
normally you pay around £ 200,000 for teenage players but we had to pay more			0
he has grown with games			0
confidence , ability and pace are his main attributes and when you have confidence you do the right things			0
has the ability to start but could be very influential off the bench against a tired defence			0
teen at the time : but @entity0 signed @entity99 at @entity2 for a hefty fee @entity121 you can see he has a lot of talent			1
he has improved a lot and looks comfortable on the international stage			0
his quality on the ball and invention give @entity6 something different and his movement can keep @entity7 thinking			2
improvement : @entity133 midfielder @entity121 has relished the step up in class with @entity6 @entity136 people in @entity7 know @entity138 and @entity139 but this season they have taken notice of @entity136 and what he has done alongside @entity142			1
he has confidence , belief and pace — that is a vital combination for a striker			0
worth a watch : @entity7 has noted @entity136 's performances for @entity2 this season			1

@entity11 is an outstanding *communicator* from the back
@entity50 will be a force , he can create something out of nothing
@entity6 's @entity157 can light up the @entity9 clash in @entity10
@entity84 , @entity99 , @entity121 and @entity136 all key
