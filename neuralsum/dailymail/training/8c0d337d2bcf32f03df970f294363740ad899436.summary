a dinosaur with a long serpent - like neck that resembles a traditional @entity4 dragon has been discovered by construction workers in southern @entity4			1
the 49 feet ( 15 metres ) long dinosaur lived around 160 million years ago during the @entity7			1
it was discovered by a construction workers digging in @entity10 , in @entity4 , when they hit a series or large neck vertebrae that were stretched out in the ground			1
@entity14 , seen here in an artists impression being chased by two carnivorous dinosaurs lived around 160 million years ago in southern @entity4			1
its name means @entity20 , due to its long serpentine neck palaeontologists who have reconstructed the skeleton say that the enormous neck accounts for up to half of the length of the animal			1
they have now named the new dinosaur @entity27 , which means dragon of @entity10 , after the distinctive serpentine dragons depicted in @entity4 legends			1
the fossilised remains of the biggest dinosaur ever discovered were found in @entity33			2
named @entity35 , the dinosaur weighed 85 tons , about as heavy as 14 african elephants , according to palaeontolgists			0
the herbivore sauropod is thought to have lived between 95 million and 100 million years ago in the cretaceous period forests of @entity40			1
after first being discovered by a farm worker , scientists then unearthed 150 bones of seven individuals			0
they estimate that the gigantic animal would have been 130ft ( 40m ) long and 65ft ( 20m ) tall			0
most long - necked dinosaurs , or sauropods , have necks that only measure about one third of their body length			1
scientists have also speculated whether discoveries of other similar fossils in the past may have led to the legends of the distinctive serpent - like dragons that persist through out @entity4			1
@entity60 , one of the scientists at the @entity62 who studied the fossil , said it was extremely unusual to find an animal with its neck in tact			2
he said : ' it is rare to find a head and neck of a long - necked dinosaur together because the head is so small and easily detached after the animal dies			1
' @entity27 is a cool animal			0
if you imagine a big animal that is half neck , you can see that evolution can do quite extraordinary things			0
' i wonder if the ancient @entity4 stumbled upon a skeleton of a long - necked dinosaur like @entity27 and pictured that mythical creature			2
' the huge fossilised vertebrae , above , of @entity27 were first dug up by construction workers in @entity10 a reconstructed skeleton of @entity27 , seen above , is now on display in @entity87 in @entity4 the new species is thought to belong to a group of dinosaurs called mamenchisaurids , plant eating dinosaurs found through out @entity94 with particularly long necks			1
unlike others in the group , however , @entity14 appears to have had air pockets within the huge bones in its vertebrae			2
the @entity103 's neck ( shown above ) makes up more than half of its entire 49 feet long body length this would have meant that the animal 's neck was relatively lightweight despite its huge size			1
unlike the mythical dragons in @entity4 , however , the neck would also have been relatively stiff			2
the scientists studying the fossil found that the bones of the vertebrae had interlocking joints , meaning it could bend up and down but was unable to move side to side much			1
this stiffness could have meant that the creature was limited in the food it could access			0
@entity14 was also far from being the largest mamenchisaurid - the first of the group found in 1952 called @entity126 reached up to 115 feet ( 35m ) in length			2
mr @entity60 , a phd student working with palaeontologistofessor @entity128 at the @entity62 , said the new discovery , which was first unearthed in 2006 , could help provide new details about why these dinosaurs evolved such long necks			0
their study is published in the @entity135			0
he said : ' @entity27 shows that long - necked dinosaurs diversified in unique ways in @entity94 during @entity140 times â€” something very special was going on in that continent			0
' nowhere else we can find dinosaurs with longer necks than those in @entity4			0
' the new dinosaur tells us that these extreme species thrived in isolation from the rest of the world			0
' it is still a mystery why mamenchisaurids did not migrate to other continents			0
' @entity156 dragons have become a popular part of traditional @entity4 culture and celebration			0
early discoveries of fossils similar to @entity27 could have started the legends about these mythical creatures			0

the dinosaur has been named @entity14 , which means dragon of @entity10
it was is thought to have lived around in @entity4 about 160 million years ago
scientists say similar fossils could have led to myths of dragons in @entity4
construction workers discovered the fossil while digging in @entity10 city
the neck makes up nearly half of the 49 - ft long dinosaur 's body length
*researchers* found the vertebrae were hollow meaning the neck was lighter
the neck bones locked together so the animal would have had a stiff neck
