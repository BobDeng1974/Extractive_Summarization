@entity0 forged relatives ' signatures , wrote fraudulent @entity12 's and lied to auditors to keep the @entity14 afloat while he extracted millions from the company for himself			1
the fund collapsed in 2009 in an ' emblematic ' example of the financial crash , with 51 - year - old @entity0 convicted of eight counts of years later			1
today the @entity21 national was jailed for 13 years at @entity22			1
the father - of - four was previously ruled against in a @entity25 action launched by creditors of one of his companies			1
it was this ruling which prompted the @entity31 to criminally investigate the financier after previously fearing there was no ' realistic prospect of conviction '			1
during his three - month trial at @entity22 , jurors heard how @entity0 blew 20 per cent of the fund over a few days of ' disastrous ' trading			1
having convinced investors - many of whom were pensioners - to agree to an ' option overlay ' , @entity0 told clients they could not lose or gain five per cent of their original input			1
the trader began using a separate company , @entity48 , to mask how much of his clients ' money he had lost			1
trading with money from the @entity14 , he invented deals and profits produced by the latter company to keep the scheme going			2
at one point the financier forged the signatures of his father - in - law and brother in @entity21 on documents including one declaring responsibility to the @entity63			1
but following the credit crunch of 2008 , investors began seeking returns on their original cash instalments			2
it was then that @entity0 launched a @entity71 - like scheme - using fresh cash investments to pay off debts to older clients			1

' in 2009 , the @entity14 was closed and @entity0 later arrested in one of the first prosecutions of its kind following the financial crash			1

the case was closed in 2011			2
the following year , a @entity25 action launched by @entity48 creditors however found he and some others liable for millions			1
mr justice @entity93 ( left ) described the trader as ' charming and clever '			0
the criminal case into his practices was reopened by @entity97 ( right ) when he took charge of the @entity31 in its wake and with the appointment of @entity97 at the @entity31 alongside threats of a judicial review from scorned creditors , the case was reopened			1
while swindling investors out of millions , it emerged @entity0 had pocketed £ 7million for himself by the time he was brought to court			2
