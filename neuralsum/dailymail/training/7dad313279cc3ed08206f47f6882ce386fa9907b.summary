by @entity1 reporter published : 20:34 est , 28 january 2014 updated : 23:02 est , 28 january 2014 unseen home video footage of the 1986 challenger shuttle disaster has surfaced and dramatically shows what the tragedy was like for @entity8 residents living right beneath the explosion			1
@entity10 and @entity11 lived in @entity12 , not at all far from @entity13			1
they used a home video camera to document their thrilling experience and @entity10 can even be heard counting down as the take - off is about to begin			1
but shortly after , something went terribly wrong and it became clear this was n't a shuttle launch like all the others			1
it turned out to be far too bright ' wow , is that a bright one , ' @entity10 exclaimed after liftoff as her husband filmed			1
@entity10 lent the footage after all these years to the @entity49 , where it 's been seen by @entity51 today for the first time on tuesday , the 28th anniversary of the disaster			1
the whimsical jangling of wind chimes in the background of the video quickly becomes foreboding as it slowly dawns on the @entity59 that something is n't right			2
ominous : the whimsical jangling of wind chimes in the background of the video quickly becomes foreboding as it slowly dawns on the @entity59 that something is n't right ' what the heck is that ? what is that ? what happened , ' @entity10 wondered after what was at first a single rocket smoke trail becomes two -- something she had n't witnessed before @entity73 : just over their neighbor 's roof , the smoke trails twisted and turned			1
things went silent in the home video as the couple waited to learn what was going on ' what the heck is that ? what is that ? what happened , ' @entity10 wonders after what was at first a single rocket smoke trail becomes two -- something she has n't witnessed before			1
just over their neighbor 's roof , the smoke trails twisted and turned			0
the @entity92 had to wait for the television to confirm what already seems clear			2
' a major problem , ' @entity10 shouted			1
' a major problem ' : @entity10 yells out the verdict as she learns it from the television ' it stays with you , ' @entity10 said nearly 30 years later			1
' it 's something you never forget ' ' oh @entity102 , ' @entity11 said			1
@entity10 told @entity49 that the experience still stands out in her mind			1
' it was just a shock , ' she said from her home in @entity8			2
mr. @entity11 died two years ago			1
' it stays with you , ' she said			0
' it 's something you never forget			0
' the cause of the accident was a faulty seal in one of the shuttle 's rockets which compromised the fuel tanks			2
the shuttle had no escape system for the astronauts , but it became known later that at least several of those on board survived the initial explosion			0
then - president @entity123 ordered a probe into the @entity32 catastrophe , where it was found that poor management and a disregard of safety advice were said to have played a role in the accident			1
it resulted in a nearly three - year lapse in @entity135 's shuttle program , with the next shuttle , @entity136 , taking off on september 29 , 1988			0
@entity135 ended the shuttle program for good last year , retiring the remaining vessels and instead opting for multimillion - dollar rides on @entity142 @entity141 capsules to get @entity51 astronauts to the @entity144			0
private @entity51 companies hope to help fill the gap , beginning with space station cargo and then , hopefully , astronauts			0
the crew of the space shuttle challenge from 1986			2
from left to right : @entity150 , @entity151 , @entity152 , @entity153 , @entity154 , @entity155 and @entity156 @entity32 was one of @entity135 's greatest successes - but also one of its darkest legacies			2
it was initially built between 1975 and 1978 to be a test vehicle , but was later converted into a fully fledged spacecraft			0
in its heyday , it completed nine milestone missions - from launching the first female astronaut into space to taking part in the first repair of a satellite by an astronaut			0
but it was also the vehicle that very nearly ended the space program when a probe into the 1986 disaster found that the shuttle was doomed before it had even taken off			2
in their honor : the @entity179 ( left ) at @entity180 in @entity180 , @entity181 , in memory of the seven crew members who died in the 1986 disaster @entity184 , a @entity135 contractor at rocket - builder @entity186 , warned in 1985 that seals on the booster rocket joints could fail in freezing temperatures			0
' the result would be a catastrophe of the highest order â € ” loss of human life , ' he wrote in a memo			0
on the eve of the ill - fated flight , @entity184 and several colleagues reiterated their concerns and argued against launching because of predicted cold weather at the @entity13			2
but they were overruled by @entity186 managers , who gave @entity135 the green light			0
after the accident , @entity184 testified to a presidential commission investigating the challenger accident			0
the group determined that hot gases leaked through a joint in one of the booster rockets shortly after blastoff that ended with the explosion of the shuttle 's hydrogen fuel			0
@entity184 died in 2012 aged 73 .			0

@entity10 and @entity11 lived in @entity12 , not at all far from @entity13
the launches were a common sight , but the one on january 28 , 1986 was *strange* from the start
something went terribly wrong and it became clear this was n't a shuttle launch like all the others as the @entity32 broke apart over their home
