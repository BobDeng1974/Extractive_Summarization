by @entity0 published : 18:25 est , 5 december 2012 updated : 08:01 est , 6 december 2012 @entity1 targeted workers at the top , middle and bottom of the financial heap yesterday with a raft of money - saving measures			1
he ordered a tax raid on higher earners ’ pensions , warning that @entity11 is only a third of the way through its age of austerity			1
he dragged 400,000 more workers into the 40p tax rate by raising the earnings threshold by just one per cent – below the rate of inflation			1
in his @entity43 , mr @entity1 admitted higher government borrowing and lower - than - expected economic growth meant spending cuts and tax rises designed to balance the books would have to be extended by an extra year , to 2018			1
official figures showed that the hardest hit by his measures will be the top ten per cent and bottom ten per cent of earners			1
but today mr @entity1 defended the move to increase the number of people earning just over £ 41,000 who will end up paying the 40p tax rate			1
' i would not describe those people as wealthy			2
they ’re better off than many of their citizens but they ’re certainly not wealthy , ' he told @entity59			2
' what i ’ve tried to do , in a very difficult situation where i ’m trying to control government spending , is make sure it is done fairly across all incomes			2
' @entity67 , on a visit to east @entity66 this morning , also defended the need for more cuts : we 've had to take very difficult decisions and i do n't hide that for a minute			0
' what this @entity43 and what this government is all about is being on the side of people who work hard and want to get on			0
' @entity67 , who today addressed the @entity78 in east @entity66 , insisted the government is ' on the side of people who work hard and want to get on ' mr @entity67 today met @entity79 , co-founder and director of electronics company technology will save us to highlight government support for entrepreneurs the prime minister added : ' by lifting the personal allowance , the amount of money you can earn before you pay any income tax , it is very close now to our goal of £ 10,000			1
' it is hugely helpful to all working people			0
it means for instance someone on the minimum wage but who works full - time , working hard , we have halved their income tax under this government			0
' clearly by cancelling the 3p increase in fuel duty we 're helping again people who have to use their cars to get to work			0
so we 're on the side of those who work hard			0
' in a boost for @entity11 , the chancellor announced a surprise increase in the personal income tax allowance , meaning the first £ 9,440 earned will be tax free			1
mr @entity1 won his loudest cheers as he told mps he was scrapping a 3p increase in fuel duty pencilled in for january			1
but official figures show that as a result of all the tax , benefit and public spending changes implemented by the @entity123 since 2010 , the average household will be around £ 1,140 worse off by 2015 , with the top fifth of households £ 2,370 worse off			1
in other key moves , corporation tax was cut by an extra penny to 21p by 2014 , compared with 28p when the @entity123 came to power , and small businesses were given investment tax breaks			1
from 2014 , lifetime pension relief allowance will fall from £ 1.5million to £ 1.25million and annual allowance will be cut from £ 50,000 to £ 40,000			2
the point at which debt is predicted to begin falling was delayed by a year to 2016			2
estimates for public - sector job losses were increased to 1.1million , though twice as many jobs will be created in the private sector			0
heads will be given discretion over teachers ’ pay in a move which infuriated trade unions			1
basic state pension will rise by 2.5 per cent next year to £ 110.15 a week			2
the chancellor said that as a result of his plans , government spending as share of national income would fall from 48 per cent in 2009/10 under @entity36 to 39.5 per cent in 2017/18			0
but he was forced to concede that there is ‘ much more to do ’ to restore the public finances to health against a backdrop of gloomy economic data			0
mr @entity1 conceded the budget deficit was ‘ still far too high for comfort ’ , though he wrongfooted shadow chancellor @entity160 by announcing that having already been cut by 25 per cent , the deficit will unexpectedly fall again this year – thanks in part to a £ 3.5billion windfall from the sale of the @entity167 mobile phone spectrum			1
he used a fresh round of spending cuts from day - to - day @entity172 budgets to pay for investment in projects designed to stimulate the economy			1
there will be a £ 5billion investment programme in new roads , 100 new free schools and academies , science laboratories , ultra-fast broadband and further education colleges			1
‘ we can not relax our efforts to make our economy safe , ’ the chancellor told mps			0
‘ but @entity11 is heading in the right direction			0
the road is hard but we ’re making progress			0
it ’s taking time , but the @entity193 economy is healing			0
‘ as well as a tax system where the richest pay their fair share , we have to have a welfare system that is fair to the working people who pay for it			2
’ mr @entity1 announced that he is to change the law to break a link between inflation and the ballooning welfare bill , with out - of - work benefits rising by just one per cent for the next three years			1
under previous rules , benefits were increased every april by the inflation rate in the previous september , which this year was 2.2 per cent			0
mr @entity1 said that as a result , the incomes of those on out - of - work benefits has soared by 20 per cent since 2007 , twice the rate of a worker on average earnings			1
@entity36 insisted that 60 per cent of those affected by the real - terms welfare cuts , however , were in work – because working tax credits , child tax credits , local housing allowance , maternity allowance and statutory maternity pay will also be affected			2
statement : @entity1 said the move would return ' fairness ' to the benefits system all smiles : the chancellor , seen with chief secretary to the treasury @entity230 and @entity67 , is forcing the @entity232 into a corner over whether to oppose the cap the chancellor said a new round of tax rises and spending cuts was necessary because the eurozone crisis had hit the economy and the recession was worse than previously thought – with almost seven per cent of national income lost in 2008 and 2009			1
quoting the latest forecasts from the @entity244 , he said the economy was now expected to shrink by 0.1 per cent this year compared with a previous prediction of 0.8 per cent growth			1
he admitted he was on course to miss his target that debt should start falling as a proportion of gdp by 2015/16 – the year of the next election			0
instead he said it would take another year			0
mr @entity160 , pictured , said the @entity43 illustrated the ¿ true scale of this @entity257 s economic failure ¿ announcing the cut in corporation tax to 21 per cent , compared with 40 in the @entity261 , 33 in @entity262 and 29 in @entity263 , the chancellor said : ‘ this is the lowest rate of any major western economy			2
@entity11 is open for business			0
’ mr @entity160 said the @entity43 illustrated the ‘ true scale of this government ’s economic failure ’			2
he added : ‘ the chancellor ’s fiscal strategy has been completely derailed			0
the defined purpose of the government , the cornerstone of the @entity123 , the one test they set themselves – to balance the books and get the debt falling by 2015 – is now in tatters			0
’ @entity36 would not say whether it intended to vote against legislation limiting benefit increases and a move to cap overall benefit payments , saying it would study the detail .			0
