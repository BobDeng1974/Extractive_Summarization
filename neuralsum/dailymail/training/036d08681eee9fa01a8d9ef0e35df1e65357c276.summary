by @entity0 published : 18:12 est , 1 april 2012 updated : 06:42 est , 3 april 2012 @entity1 – whose boss once claimed it was ‘ doing @entity5 ’s work ’ – has been exposed as investing in a company linked to prostitution and sex trafficking of underage girls			1
the revelation plunged the @entity12 investment bank into fresh embarrassment over its business ethics weeks after a former executive claimed bosses there called clients ‘ muppets ’			1
it has emerged that a private equity fund run by the bank had taken a major stake in a secretive company called @entity25			1
it owns a classified advertising website – @entity28 – that is accused of being the biggest forum for illegal sex trafficking of underage girls in @entity12			1
headquarters : @entity1 , which owns @entity34 , has signed a deal to sell its 16 per cent stake in @entity25 , which owns the website , called @entity28 @entity34 said it had agreed to sell its 16 per cent stake in the media company , admitting it had lost much of its investment in the process			1
@entity1 insisted it had grown ‘ uncomfortable with the direction of the company ’ and its inability to influence its direction			2
however @entity49 columnist @entity48 , who exposed the connection , said the bank had been ‘ mortified ’ when he first inquired about its stake last week and ‘ began working frantically to unload its shares ’			1
@entity28 is estimated to have a nearly 80 per cent share of online prostitution advertising in the @entity12 , worth some £ 2.5million a month			1
it also hosts advertising forums in at least a dozen other countries including the @entity59			2
stake : a @entity62 spokesman said the fund invested $ 30million in the @entity25 in 2000 in @entity59 , it is used by hundreds of prostitutes across 19 cities and regions , ranging from @entity68 and @entity69 to @entity70 and @entity71			2
pimps reportedly use the website to peddle underage girls , using euphemisms such as ‘ petite ’ to provide potential clients with a clue to their real age			2
there have been growing calls in the @entity12 for the owners of @entity28 to drop the ‘ adult ’ classified section			1
critics including prosecutors , politicians and religious leaders say many of the adverts for so - called escorts are soliciting sex with children , who are sometimes substituted at the point of sale for the adults who have been pictured			2
but anti-sex trafficking campaigners have been hampered in their efforts because @entity25 is privately owned and does n’t have to reveal its owners			2
@entity1 invested £ 19million in @entity25 , an alternative @entity49 newspaper , in 2000 and the stake was converted into a 16 per cent minority stake when the publication merged with another media company , @entity25 , in 2006			0
since then a @entity1 managing director , @entity102 , has had a seat on the board of the new company			0
@entity25 has rejected demands to close down its adult adverts section , insisting the advertising would simply move offshore and outside the jurisdiction of @entity12 authorities			1
the company said it was co-operating with investigators and had reported 2,695 cases of suspected child trafficking to officials in 2011			0
@entity1 – once memorably described as a ‘ great vampire squid ’ sucking up money from wherever it could – has an unenviable reputation as one of the banking world ’s greediest players			0
that image was reinforced last month when @entity123 , a @entity1 executive director , resigned with a stinging attack on its ‘ toxic and destructive ’ culture			0
controversy : nearly 80 per cent of the $ 3.1million revenue earned from online prostitution advertising has been attributed to @entity28 by classified advertising consultant @entity129 protest : @entity131 , right , whose late father , @entity132 , co-founded the @entity25 , demands it stop running sex ads of minors at a rally on thursday he said the bank regularly put its own financial interests before those of its clients , whom bank bosses frequently dismissed as ‘ muppets ’			1
@entity1 chief executive @entity142 claimed in 2009 that bankers were doing ‘ @entity5 ’s work ’			0
he was speaking after the bank had provoked anger by revealing it planned to lavish a record £ 13.4billion in pay and bonuses on its staff			1
defending the move just 12 months after bankers brought the world ’s economy to the brink of collapse , mr @entity142 said modern banking performed a vital function and described himself as just a banker ‘ doing @entity5 ’s work ’			0
‘ we ’re very important , ’ he said			0
‘ we help companies to grow by helping them to raise capital			0
‘ companies that grow create wealth			0
this , in turn , allows people to have jobs that create more growth and more wealth			0
we have a social purpose			0
