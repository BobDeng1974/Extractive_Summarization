leading optometrist @entity0 said a fringe across the face can obstruct light and stimulation to eye making it amblyotic but expert dr @entity6 said this can only happen if the eye is permanently covered before the age of seven it 's a hairstyle favoured by celebs from @entity12 to @entity13 and often copied by their young fans			1
but a leading optometrist has warned that having a side fringe that falls into the face can cause long - term eye damage			1
@entity0 told the @entity20 @entity19 : ' if a young emo chap has a fringe covering one eye all the time , that eye wo n't see a lot of detail			1
and if it happens from a young age , that eye can become amblyotic			2
' hair raising : @entity12 , left , and @entity31 often wear a side fringe - but could it damage their sight ? not according to experts @entity37 is more commonly known as a lazy eye and is a childhood condition which means the sufferer ca n't see as clearly out of one eye , so they rely on the other			2
it can occur as a child 's sight develops so if a child has one of their eyes blocked , eg by an eye patch , when they are in a key developmental stage then they could develop a lazy eye			0
mr @entity0 believes having a side fringe means the hair can become like an eye patch across the eye and so cause the condition , and also short - sightedness , by restricting sunlight and stimulation from reaching the eye			1
' if you walk around with an eye patch on all day , then that eye will end up seeing more poorly than the other eye , ' he explained			0
@entity68 trend : members of the band @entity70 favour the fringe across the face look he added that he was aware that visual development took place between birth to seven years , but that research had shown him vision could still be affected at later stages			2
but experts have poured cold water on mr @entity0 's theory			0
amblyopia specialist dr @entity6 told @entity83 : ' the story would only be true if you had somebody young enough , and if that person never looked out of that eye - if it was blocked 24 - 7			1
the reason it 's false is that you do nâ€™t have that constant deprivation			0
' dr @entity6 added that vision is ' so well - established ' after the age of seven that ' combing your hair over your eye will not do anything to that system '			1
so teenagers and young people can rest assured that they wo n't be risking their long - term eye sight by wearing the trendy style			0
however , a leading @entity20 hairdresser told the @entity105 they do run another risk - a sore neck ! @entity108 said : ' i have to wonder how they do n't get a stiff neck			0
i have seen lots of fashions come and go - but really when i think about it , this is probably the only hairstyle in my 40 years of hairdressing that could be a health hazard			0
