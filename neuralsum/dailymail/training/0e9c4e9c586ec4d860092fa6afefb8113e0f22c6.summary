climate change scientists warned yesterday that the @entity1 is set for more heatwaves , floods , droughts and rising sea levels that could swamp coasts and low - lying islands as greenhouse gases build up in the atmosphere			1
but despite these dire predictions , they admitted global warming is likely to be more gradual than they previously thought and that world temperatures have barely changed in the past 15 years			1
in its first report for six years , the @entity14 states that global warming is ‘ unequivocal ’ – and it is ‘ 95 per cent certain ’ that human activity is the ‘ dominant ’ cause			1
it claims a rise in temperature in the @entity27 ( right ) will cause snow cover to decrease by 25 per cent by the end of the 21st century			0
but the report failed to conclusively explain why the rise in global average surface temperatures had largely ' paused ' over the past two decades ( left ) the high latitudes and the equatorial @entity34 are likely to experience an increase in annual mean precipitation by the end of this century ( right )			1
in many midlatitude and subtropical dry regions , mean precipitation will likely decrease from the 1986 - 2005 period ( left ) @entity41 secretary - general ban ki - moon said : ‘ the heat is on			0
’ but others questioned the credibility of the predictions , pointing out that the @entity14 ’s research had signally failed to predict the ongoing ‘ pause ’ in rising world temperatures			1
dr @entity50 , of the @entity51 , said : ‘ the @entity14 has taken a huge gamble			0
‘ unless global temperatures begin to rise in the next few years , the @entity14 is very likely going to suffer an existential blow to its credibility			1
’ the 36 - page summary of the report was released yesterday after four days of intense negotiations between officials from 110 countries and scientists behind closed doors in @entity63			1
it states that each of the past three decades has been progressively warmer than any preceding decade since 1850 and , in the @entity27 , 1983 to 2012 is likely to have been the warmest 30 - year period in the past 1,400 years			1
@entity68 concentrations have increased by 40 per cent since pre-industrial times , primarily from fossil fuel emissions , claims the @entity14			1
the ocean has absorbed about 30 per cent of the emitted anthropogenic carbon dioxide , causing ocean acidification ocean acidification is determined by a decreases in @entity76 of ocean surface water has decreased by 0.1 since the beginning of the industrial era , according to the report it also claims that it is ‘ extremely likely ’ that man is responsible for ‘ more than 50 per cent ’ of the temperature rises seen since 1951			1
but the report summary offered little detailed evidence to back up that claim			2
the most controversial part of the 2,000 - page report , which will be released in full on monday , is the one that addresses why the rise in global average surface temperature has ‘ paused ’			2
the report acknowledges that temperature rises have dropped from 0.12c per decade since 1951 to just 0.05c per decade since 1998 – despite record amounts of greenhouse gases being pumped into the atmosphere			1
critics say this shows that carbon dioxide is not as damaging as had been claimed and several governments called for references to the slowdown to be amended or even removed from the report			1
in fact , the slowdown is acknowledged more prominently than it was in draft versions , with the @entity14 saying that much of the ‘ missing ’ heat is stored deep beneath the sea , preventing it from contributing to temperatures at surface level			2
volcanic eruptions and changes in the sun ’s activity are also thought to have contributed			0
scientists say they are confident in the computer programs they use to model the effects of carbon dioxide on the planet – they just ca n’t predict random events such as volcanic eruptions			1
they say that such pauses in warming occur regularly through history , the slowdown is only temporary and climate change remains a pressing threat			0
for the first time , the @entity14 also makes a short - term forecast , saying that temperatures will rise between 0.2c and 0.6c between now and 2035			2
by the end of the century , the global average temperature could rise by 4.8c			0
this is lower than the previous worst case scenario of 6.4c but scientists stress it is still enough to have an ‘ enormous ’ impact on the planet			2
the lowest predicted temperature increase has also been scaled down from 1.1c , to 0.3c – however , they claim achieving this would require rapid and drastic cuts in emissions			0
melting ice and an expansion of water as it warms could drive sea levels up by up to 32 inches by the end of the century – 40 per cent more than previously predicted			2
the @entity14 also says it is ‘ very likely ’ that the @entity149 , which brings heat north from the tropics and keeps @entity152 warmer than it would be otherwise , will slow down			0
this could stop the temperature rising for ten or 20 years in @entity152 but would be unlikely to make the country much colder			2
the @entity14 has revised down its estimate of how sensitive the climate is to carbon dioxide , saying that a doubling of levels in the atmosphere would raise temperatures long - term by between 1.5c and 4.5c			1
the previous lower limit was 2c			0
the report says it is ‘ extremely likely ’ – or at least 95 per cent certain – that the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation are the main cause of rising temperatures since the @entity170			1
that level of certainty is up from 90 per cent in the report in 2007 and 66 per cent in 2001			2
the world ’s biggest environmental charities , including @entity176 and @entity177 , called for immediate action to cut greenhouse gas emissions			1
@entity180 , of the @entity181 , said reducing the amount of carbon dioxide we pump into the atmosphere is unlikely to be enough			1
instead , it is ‘ very likely ’ we will need to embrace new technologies such as artificial trees that actively suck carbon out of the atmosphere			1
the findings of the report and two that will follow will feed into treaty talks in @entity194 in 2015			2
energy secretary @entity195 said : ‘ this strengthens the case for international leaders to work for an ambitious , legally binding global agreement in 2015 to cut carbon emissions			0
’ @entity201 , of @entity202 , said : ‘ scientists are more certain than ever that climate change is real			0
how we choose to act now will make a vital difference to the lives of today ’s children and of future generations			0
‘ if we fail , our children will carry the devastating burden of our inaction			0
’ scientists claim that global average sea levels will continue to rise during the 21st century under all temperature scenarios presented in the report			1
they say it will ' very likely ' exceed that observed during 1971 - 2010 due to increased ocean warming and loss of mass from glaciers and ice sheets during the longest period calculated ( 1901 - 2012 ) , almost the entire globe experienced surface warming			0
the report said that warming of the climate system is ' unequivocal '			0
however , the report conceded that world temperatures have barely risen in the past 15 years the authors of the latest @entity14 report have clearly been stung by the barrage of criticism over the past few years			1
for while they are more confident than ever that mankind is changing the climate , several of the gloomier predictions from the previous 2007 analysis are toned down			0
some of the changes reflect the science and growing sophistication of computer models			0
but other parts of the report appear to have been written in direct response to climate change sceptics			0
this follows huge embarrassment when claims that most @entity253 glaciers would vanish within 25 years were exposed as nonsense			0
@entity253 glaciers : scientists have already withdrawn claims that they would vanish in 25 years @entity14 chairman @entity258 said that ‘ human failing ’ led to the predicted date being brought forward by 300 years			1
in fact , the claim had been lifted from a report by the @entity264			0
the latest report simply says that the world ’s glaciers will shrink by between 15 and 85 per cent by the end of the century			1
one of the biggest differences between yesterday ’s report and the 2007 version comes in a key figure , used to work out how much temperatures will respond to the extra greenhouse gases pumped into the air by factories , farming and cars			1
six years ago , the @entity14 estimated that a doubling of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere would increase temperatures between 2c and 4.5c			1
the latest update tones down that effect , known as the ‘ equilibrium climate sensitivity ’			0
now the same increase in @entity68 will lead to a rise of between 1.5c and 4.5c , the @entity14 says			2
in 2007 , the @entity14 gave a range of estimates for temperature increases by the end of the century – from 1.1c above the 1850 levels to a whopping 6.4c hike			0
the new report is more measured , predicting increases between 0.3c and 1.7c if carbon emissions are halted almost immediately , and 2.6 - 4.8c if they are @entity297 are other changes			2
in 2007 , the authors of the report predicted that tropical storms would be more intense and frequent under a climate change future			0
today , they are far less confident – and say there is only a ‘ more likely than not ’ chance of more intense tropical storms in @entity306 and the @entity307			0
as was widely anticipated , the report acknowledges that global warming has slowed down since the exceptionally hot year of 1998 – but adds that 15 years is not long enough to make any firm conclusions about this apparent pause			1
there is also a reference to the medieval warm period – a time between 950 and 1250 when temperatures were similar to the late 20th century			0
however , the authors say this warming did not take place as coherently across seasons and regions as the current phase of global warming			0
many of the predictions and measurements are more gloomy			0
sea levels are now predicted to rise more quickly and carbon dioxide concentrations in the air are now the highest they have been for 800,000 years			1
in 2007 , the levels were at a 650,000 - year high			2
six years ago , the scientists said it was ‘ very likely ’ that human behaviour was changing the climate , but they now believe it is ‘ extremely likely ’ .			2

report *compiled* by over 800 scientists and used *9,000* scientific studies
but conceded that world temperatures have barely risen in past 15 years
this is despite more greenhouse gases being pumped into atmosphere
critics say this shows carbon dioxide is *n't* as damaging as was claimed
@entity351 said @entity68 has reached levels *unprecedented* in at least *80,000* year
