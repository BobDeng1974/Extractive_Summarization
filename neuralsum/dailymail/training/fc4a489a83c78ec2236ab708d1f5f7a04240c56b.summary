she was testifying against a preacher who allegedly raped her and sexually assaulted her schoolgirl daughter after claiming she had been ‘ cursed ’ by witchcraft			0
barristers asked the witness to speak more slowly and stand further from the microphone so the jury could understand her , blaming her accent and the courtroom ’s ‘ acoustics ’			1
but finally court clerk @entity21 realised the problem – the witness was not speaking @entity3 at all , but @entity5 , an @entity7 variant that is native to @entity25			1
miss @entity26 , who also hails from @entity25 , told judge @entity4 about the unfortunate situation about an hour into yesterday ’s proceedings			1
in desperation , the judge swore the clerk in to interpret for the 38 - year - old witness , and a new clerk was found to replace her on the bench			1
but the interpreter was barely used as the witness – who can not be named for legal reasons – repeated the words ‘ i ca n’t remember ’ in response to almost every question			0
@entity40 , 61 , a @entity41 preacher who runs @entity40 , is charged with four counts of rape , one of attempted rape , two of sexual assault and one of battery			0
his church , said to have a @entity52 membership of 36,000 , is run from a large unit on an industrial estate on the edge of @entity56 , south - east @entity57			0
the witness , who is originally from @entity59 , @entity25 , claims to have been the subject of @entity40 ’s abuse for up to eight years			1
but after numerous complaints during her evidence that the woman could not be understood , the judge appointed @entity66 - @entity26 to help			2
he told jurors : ‘ although not a standard interpretation … we are actually going to use @entity71 as something a bit like an interpreter			0
’ miss @entity21 then swore the standard interpreters ’ oath and joined the witness in the box			0
a woman gave evidence at @entity81 ( pictured ) for more than an hour before anyone realised she was not speaking @entity3 @entity81 has heard that @entity40 ’s alleged victim had come to @entity52 from @entity25 in 2003 and visited his church in @entity56 in january 2006			1
@entity5 is spoken by about 97 per cent of the population of @entity25 and unites a number of different ethnic groups in the @entity89 nation			2
the language is native to the @entity92 people , a community of about 300,000 descendants of freed slaves from the @entity96 , @entity97 and @entity52			0
it is believed to date back to the 17th and 18th centuries when an @entity3 - based ‘ pidgin ’ language emerged to facilitate the coastal trade between @entity103 and @entity104			2
however , @entity3 is @entity25 ’s official language and despite its common use , @entity5 has no official status in the country			1
she came under @entity40 ’s influence when she was convinced by her friends he was the only man who could cure voices in her head that were preventing her from sleeping , the court has been told			0
but he kept the woman as a sex slave in a small room at one of his churches – forcing her to have an abortion when she became pregnant , it is alleged			0
the court has heard that the first rape happened in late 2006 or early 2007 when @entity40 may have drugged the victim ’s cup of tea before attacking her			0
the preacher , of @entity56 , later sexually assaulted her daughter by groping her breasts , the court was told			0
a spokesman from @entity132 said the witness had been speaking a form of @entity3 ‘ with an extremely strong accent ’ that made it hard for the court to understand			1
the spokesman added : ‘ as a result , she was asked to repeat phrases and sentences … even then it was difficult to understand			0
@entity40 , pictured centre , is on trial at @entity81 charged with sexual offences ‘ the court clerk is also from @entity25 and could understand everything the witness said so it was agreed that the clerk would take the interpreter ’s oath and assist			1
‘ she did not translate what the witness said but , when necessary , repeated in clear @entity3 those passages which could not be understood			2
’ @entity5 is spoken by about 97 per cent of @entity25 ’s population and is native to the creole people – descendants of freed slaves from the @entity96 , @entity97 and @entity52			2
