tickets are still available for the blockbuster @entity2 match between @entity4 and @entity5 at the @entity6			1
an article on @entity4 's official website , posted on tuesday morning , said a limited selection of single - seat tickets would be on sale from the stadium ticket office in the hours up to kick - off			1
we asked @entity15 of fan site @entity16 just why @entity4 fans were n't flocking to arguably the club 's biggest game of the season so far against one of the giants of @entity25 football			1
tickets are still available for @entity4 's crucial @entity2 with @entity5 on tuesday a @entity4 spokesman said they expect the match to sell - out with an attendance of around 44,500			1
the capacity is reduced from the normal by @entity32 regulations			0

it should be a prestigious occasion , with the reigning @entity39 champions taking on their @entity41 counterparts , yet tickets remain on open sale and the attendance is likely to be under 40,000			2
so , why is there seemingly such apathy amongs the @entity4 support for such a high - profile game ? qualifying for the @entity2 always seemed like the holy grail , competing with @entity32 ’s elite sides on a regular basis , but now that we are actually there it feels like something of an anti-climax and it has failed to capture the imagination of @entity4 fans			1
one factor is the tedium brought about by the flawed @entity2 structure and seedings system			1
for the second year running we were drawn in a virtually identical group with both @entity5 and @entity63			2
this will be the sixth time in four years that we have faced @entity66			0
it ’s dull and monotonous playing the same teams over and over again			0
the @entity6 will host @entity4 's @entity2 clash with @entity5 on tuesday an online ground plan said a limited number of tickets were still available for the match			1
they are no longer available to purchase online but the club said sales would continue from the ticket office ahead of the game there is also a general disillusionment with @entity32 at present ; indeed , the @entity4 fans will stage a protest prior to kick - off on tuesday evening			1
the main grievance relates to the away tie in @entity85 , played in october			0
@entity32 insisted that the game be played behind closed doors , leaving many @entity4 fans who had already paid for flights and hotels out of pocket and unable to claim compensation			1
to add insult to injury , around 350 @entity63 fans were in the ground for the game regardless , making a mockery of the punishment			2
their fine for racism and crowd trouble was eventually reduced to a paltry £ 79,000			0
@entity4 , meanwhile , were fined £ 49m for having the temerity to invest in their team and local community			2
however , the overriding factor is , of course , economical			0
@entity4 ’s support is predominantly working class and many people simply balk at paying £ 40 to see a game of football			2
particularly when it comes just three days after another home game , costing a similar amount			0
once you factor in that the game is on terrestrial television , and that @entity121 is a matter of weeks away , then it ’s not hard to see why ticket sales have been sluggish			0
city must beat @entity124 leaders @entity5 who boast a 100 per cent record in the @entity2 @entity4 find themselves bottom of @entity127 , with just two points to their credit so far and two games left the likes of @entity132 and @entity133 may well sneer , but as multi-millionaire footballers they lost touch with the economic realities facing most people a long time ago			1
rival fans , too , will no doubt chortle about it on social media , although i ’ve never really understood the obsession with attendances			2
imagine being a grown man and mocking another club for the size of their crowds ? i do n’t feel superior to , say , a fan of @entity150 because they only get 3,000 at their games			0
you ’d be an idiot if you did			0
rather than resorting to cheap point scoring , fans across the country should be working together to address the real issues at hand here : namely the rampant commercialisation of the game , and exponential ticket price increases that are preventing many working - class fans from attending football matches			0
