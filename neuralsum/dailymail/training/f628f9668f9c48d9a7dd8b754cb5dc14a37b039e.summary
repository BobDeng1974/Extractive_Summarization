@entity0 is set to meet the @entity2 board on wednesday for the talks that will determine his point of departure from @entity6			1
the @entity2 manager is expected to convene with football board chairman @entity8 and @entity10 ’s lieutenant @entity9 with legal teams of both parties present			1
the midweek showdown is where @entity0 will learn of the club ’s response to serving written intent to quit at the end of the 12 - month notice period on his contract — the move that stunned @entity24 football on friday			2
@entity0 watched @entity2 lose 2 - 0 at @entity25 on friday night @entity0 could then be placed on gardening leave or have his contract settled at a cost of £ 400,000 in order to have the issue resolved before @entity30 visit @entity6 on saturday and next monday ’s @entity31			1
but he could yet remain until the end of the season , with the balance paid in the summer			0
clearing out @entity0 and his entire coaching staff , including assistant @entity38 and no 3 @entity39 , would clock in at a fee of more than £ 1million for a cash - strapped club relying on @entity10 loans to limp through the winter			1
@entity2 chief executive @entity44 ( top row centre ) talks to @entity0 before the match it remains to be seen if @entity10 , who controversially handed @entity49 and @entity50 jobs at @entity51 , is content to write the cheque and parachute a preferred candidate in at the first - team helm			1
his man , @entity9 , a non-executive director , has been implementing savage cuts at a lower level and not among the high earning staff — a move that left @entity0 alarmed and helped precipitate his decision to quit			2
from the clutch of front - runners to replace @entity0 , the @entity51 owner is likely to find the name of @entity65 for his consideration as the no 1 @entity24 contender			0
@entity2 manager @entity0 ( right ) was the centre of attention at @entity25 the former @entity72 manager has upped his presence at @entity6 in recent months			2
@entity65 has spoken previously of managing @entity2 being his career ambition and , perhaps crucially for his immediate employment prospects , boasts an excellent second - tier record in @entity77 , including a promotion for @entity79 and @entity81 appearance with @entity82			0
@entity0 ordered his players in for saturday training in the aftermath of friday night ’s pitiful performance at @entity25			0
that 2 - 0 loss did not see @entity2 concede any further title ground on saturday because leaders @entity90 ’ match at @entity92 was postponed			0
@entity25 's @entity93 rifles his free - kick into the net to break the deadlock @entity97 fires home to put his side 2 - 0 up against @entity2			0

@entity0 will meet chairman @entity8 and @entity10 ’s lieutenant @entity9 on wednesday
@entity103 boss handed in his notice as he had had enough following job losses to long - serving staff
@entity2 boss willing to give up more than £ 400,000 to aid settlement
