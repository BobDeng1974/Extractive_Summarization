by @entity0 published : 05:43 est , 13 september 2012 updated : 08:44 est , 14 september 2012 when @entity3 suffered dramatic weight loss and was continually being sick , her parents feared she may have developed an eating disorder			1
they took the nine - year - old to see a gp , who could only suggest she may have been suffering acid reflux and gave her medication to ease the condition			1
it was not until seven months later , when the youngster fainted and underwent an mri scan that the truth was discovered - she had one , possibly two , life - threatening brain tumours			1
by this stage she had lost 4kg			0
she had to undergo an emergency operation was given just a 50/50 chance of pulling through			0
survivor : @entity3 , pictured with her mother @entity22 , was wrongly diagnosed with an eating disorder when she in fact had two brain tumours vip visitors : @entity3 in @entity27 with her brother @entity28 and @entity30 footballers @entity29 ( far right ) and @entity31 @entity3 , from @entity32 , @entity33 , survived the operation in which 95 per cent of the tumour was removed and , now aged 11 , recently completed a 48 - week cycle of radiotherapy and chemotherapy treatment			1
her parents , @entity22 and @entity40 , heard @entity3 throwing up every morning and feared she was deliberately making herself sick to look like ' stick - thin celebrities '			1
mrs @entity3 , 34 , said : ' at first i thought it was down to travel sickness but at one stage she was throwing up every morning			1
she was given acid tablets by her gp but they were n’t working			2
' her appetite started going - she was never a fussy eater and always had a fantastic appetite			0
' i took her to hospital to see a paediatric consultant and they were still thinking along the lines of acid reflux			1
we would try and tempt her with her favourite foods , but it just was n’t happening			0
' that ’s when i thought it was possibly an eating disorder			0
' she has never been image conscious , but i could n’t think of any other reason			0
i know how some girls are these days seeing all the celebrities in magazines and on tv , and i tried to catch her out			0
' we had rows about it and she would get really upset			2
' family ties : @entity3 with her parents @entity22 and @entity40 and her brother @entity28 the truth of @entity3 ’s condition finally emerged in january 2011 - five months after she first felt unwell - when she fainted in front of her father during a visit to her grandmother ’s house and claimed she had pins and needles in her legs			1
she underwent an @entity82 at @entity83 and the family were told a tumour - and possibly a second one - had shown up on the scans			0
in february 2011 , @entity3 underwent a seven - hour operation and then , starting in april that year , began chemo treatment to ensure the remainder of the tumour was not active			1
mrs @entity3 said : ' it was when we met the oncology consultant i knew exactly what we were dealing with			1
i just kept thinking , things do n’t happen to @entity97			0
' but @entity3 took it really well			2
she was n’t bothered about the chemo and got really excited about the aspect of wearing all sorts of different hats and wigs			0
' but despite losing her hair , @entity3 has only worn a wig twice			2
she returned home in april last year and started a 48 - week cycle of chemotherapy treatment , with breaks in - between and continued physiotherapy			0
local hero : @entity3 meets @entity113 star @entity112 , who plays barman @entity114 in the soap on holiday : @entity3 and @entity28 at @entity117 in @entity118 in june 2010 , two months before she started feeling ill she went for her final dose of treatment in june this year , and she will receive regular check - ups from now on to ensure the tumour does not become active again			1
her parents are now campaigning for greater awareness about brain cancer , one of @entity128 's biggest killers			1
her father thinks @entity3 could have been treated faster if there was more widespread knowledge about the disease 's symptoms			2
mr @entity40 said : ' through our experience we just ca n’t believe how little money and effort goes into raising awareness about brain cancer and the symptoms			1
' we honestly believed @entity3 had an eating disorder			2
yet brain tumours kill more women under the age of 35 than breast or any other cancer			2
it ’s shocking , when you look at the campaigns that go on for breast cancer			2
' we are so proud of her daughter			0
people do n’t understand how inspiring and motivating she has been			0
' we would have really struggled if she had n’t been the way she is - she ’s only worn her wig twice because she does n’t the chemo get to her			0
' @entity3 's father @entity40 is trekking the @entity161 to raise money for brain cancer research			1
he can be sponsored at @entity164			0
