by @entity0 published : 18:45 est , 21 february 2013 updated : 18:47 est , 21 february 2013 the government 's planning reforms have spectacularly failed to stimulate a new wave of house building across the country			1
figures showed that the number of new homes started last year in @entity9 was a massive 11 per cent lower than the year before - exacerbating the chronic shortages at a time when the population is on the rise			1
work was started on just 98,280 properties in 2012 - one of the lowest totals in recent years and less than half of the country 's estimated need			1
declining : the number of new builds is declining despite government efforts to boost the industry the disappointing figures come despite former planning minister @entity26 ' high - profile reforms to free up public land for building , to enable communities to identify parcels of land for building , and to help people get a foot on the housing ladder through new state - backed mortgage schemes			1
last night @entity38 , @entity39 's housing spokesman , said thousands of young people would be denied the chance to own their own home unless more houses were built			2
' @entity45 's failed housing policies are making the biggest housing crisis in a generation worse , not better , ' he said			2
' nearly 18 months on from @entity45 's promise to " get @entity51 building " , it 's clear he is failing			2
' we started to build 11 per cent fewer homes in 2012 than the previous year , less than 100,000 homes in the whole of @entity9 and only two fifths of what is needed to meet housing need			1
tough times : @entity38 said that the government is failing new buyers who want to get onto the property market ' this government 's failing housing and economic policies are depriving millions of people of a decent home			1
@entity69 families are locked out of home ownership			0
too many are struggling with the choice between paying rent and feeding their families because rents have soared			0
' too many people presenting as homeless , staying in bed and breakfast and sleeping on our streets			0
and too many building workers on the dole and young people out of work desperate for an apprenticeship			0
' figures show that in 2012 , annual housing starts totalled 98,280 - 11 per cent down from the 2011 figure			1
locked out : the number of homes that are available to new buyers is lower than before this compares to a recent high of 183,000 housing starts in 2006 , but numbers have fallen since the credit crunch to a low of 75,000 in 2009			1
the numbers recovered slightly but have now fallen back again			0
however , the number of homes completed rose slightly over the past year - up 1 per cent to 115,620 in 2012			1
a spokesman for the @entity101 said : ' the government is far from complacent , which is why despite the need to tackle the deficit we 're investing £ 19.5billion public and private funding in an affordable housing programme set to deliver 170,000 homes , putting £ 1.3billion into unlocking stalled sites and building the infrastructure we need and making enough formerly used , surplus public sector land available to deliver 33,000 new homes			2
' and to help aspiring homeowners get their foot on the housing ladder , the funding for lending scheme is helping improve the access to and availability of mortgages , while our @entity122 and @entity123 schemes are helping thousands of people buy newly - built homes with a fraction of the deposit they would normally require			0
' the @entity129 said the country needs to end its obsession with owner occupation and consider a range of housing options , including build to let			0
@entity135 , the organisation 's director of policy , said : ' against the backdrop of these figures we need to seriously think about how we 're going to build the homes this country needs to meet growing demand			2
' as things stand the owner occupied model just is n't delivering the required numbers , and we need to focus on a range of options			0
' to improve overall housing supply it needs to be affordable , does not require access to mortgage finance and not put undue strain on tight public finances			0
an institutional - funded professional rented sector , building to let , ticks all these boxes			0

the number of homes started in @entity9 last year was 11 per cent lower than the year before
just 98,280 properties were started , less than half of the country 's estimated need
this is despite the government 's reforms to encourage new builds
