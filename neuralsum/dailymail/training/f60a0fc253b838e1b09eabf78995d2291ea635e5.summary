@entity60 : thousands of delegates from across @entity3 were meeting this week to seal a power transfer in the @entity64 leadership costumes : the delegates mingled in @entity31 prior to the opening session of the congress pledges : @entity3 's government promised its people it would fight corruption , improve the despoiled environment and address other quality - of - life issues demanded by an increasingly vocal public looking for change the legislature , most of whose members belong to the party and are bound to vote as the leadership dictates , will approve a proposed streamlining of government ministries , as well as appointments			1
in reality , the decisions have already been made by the @entity81 leadership and party power - brokers behind closed doors			1
@entity3 's government has pledged to repair the country 's ravaged environment and boost public services under its new leadership , an acknowledgment that quality of life was sidelined during the outgoing administration 's decade of breakneck economic growth			2
in a policy speech opening the national legislature 's yearly session tuesday , soon - to - retire premier @entity104 detailed a list of problems that had grown in recent years and was being left to his successors			2

the unfinished agenda of @entity3 's past decade are now central concerns of the new leadership as it seeks to assuage a public that is looking beyond pocket - book issues , empowered by the @entity152 and increasingly vocal about the need for change			2
@entity104 acknowledged the responsibility he and other retiring leaders have for leaving such a tangle of problems , even as they have guided @entity3 to prosperity and power on the world stage			0
' some of these problems have built up over time , while others have emerged in the course of economic and social development , and still others have been caused by inadequacies and weaknesses in our government work , ' @entity104 said in a 100 - minute speech to the nearly 3,000 legislative deputies in the @entity14 , his last address before stepping down			0
though @entity104 delivered the address , it represents the priorities of the new leadership headed by @entity81 chief @entity179 and it underscores the inflection point many @entity3 feel the country has reached : the policies that delivered stunning growth are foundering in the ill - effects of corruption and environmental degradation , and many @entity3 believe benefits unfairly accrue to a party - connected elite			1
