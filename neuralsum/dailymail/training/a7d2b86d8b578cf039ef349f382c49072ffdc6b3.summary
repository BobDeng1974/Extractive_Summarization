by @entity0 , @entity1 correspondent almost half of new mothers are now over 30 as record numbers of older women choose to start families			1
and most of these women are married , in comparison with new mums in their 20s who are far more likely to be single or living with a partner			2
nearly 360,000 women in their 30s gave birth last year – 49 per cent of the total – and just under seven in ten were married , the @entity13 said			1
changing times : the proportion of women having children aged under 25 has fallen sharply while over- 35s has risen meanwhile 369,000 women under 30 gave birth but their family situations were less stable than their older counterparts on the whole , with almost two - thirds either cohabiting or single			1
the average age of new mothers also hit a historic high of 29.8 years , up from 29.7 in 2011			1
the figure has been rising since 1975 , when a woman typically gave birth at 26.4 years			0
now the average age of motherhood is higher than it was during the 1930s and 1940s , when it reached a peak of 29.3 years in 1944			1
the @entity13 said : ‘ the overall rise since 1975 reflects the increasing numbers of women who have been delaying childbearing to later ages			2
‘ possible influences include increased participation in higher education , increased female participation in the labour force , the increasing importance of a career , the rising costs of childbearing , labour market uncertainty , housing factors and instability of partnerships			0
’ overall , just over half – 53 per cent – of babies were born to married mothers			2
family : most parents are now aged over 30 , with fathers more likely to be older , the @entity13 said warning : midwives said older mothers were more likely to suffer from complications ( file photo ) among mothers in their 30s , 69 per cent were married , while only 37 per cent of under - 20s were married			1
this dropped to one in five among those aged between 20 and 25			0
the @entity13 report suggests young mothers are increasingly likely to be less well - off and in relationships that are more likely to break down , while older mothers tend to be in stable relationships and have reliable incomes			1
previous studies have found cohabiting relationships typically break up within three years , often creating single - parent families			0
by contrast , families of married couples are more likely to stay together , and are on average wealthier , healthier , and the children benefit from a better education			0
author on the family @entity92 said : ‘ there is a big divide opening up between better - off , better - educated women who wait until they are older and marry before having children , and younger and often poorer mothers who do not see marriage as a first step			2
they have children in more casual relationships			0
‘ we should be worried by this because it is clear from all the data that children whose parents are not married have a much higher risk of seeing their family break up			0
‘ we need reforms to encourage women to marry before they have children to give their children a better chance			0

average age of women giving birth is now 29.8 years , @entity13 reveals
proportion of over- 30s giving birth has *doubled* in a *generation*
babies born to older mothers are more likely to have married parents
