parents could soon be able to take their toddlers out on skateboarding trips with them - as a pushchair has been invented that combines the two			0
the wacky contraption consists of an elongated skateboard , known as a longboard , which has the seat section of a child 's buggy attached to the front of it			2
children between the ages of nine months and four - and - a - half years old can comfortably sit in the buggy while their parents can hop on the back and propel it along			2
the bizarre product dubbed the @entity22 has also been enhanced with a brake at the back and handlebars for steering behind the seat section			1
the product has been created by design studio @entity34 in @entity36 , @entity37 , for buggy brand @entity38			1
inventors behind the @entity22 hope it will be an environmentally friendly alternative to travelling in cities and that parents will choose it over a car or bus			1
around eight prototypes of the product have been invented and it is currently being tested and evaluated for health and safety measures			1
@entity34 , 42 , owner of @entity50 , said : ' last year we were approached by @entity38 and they had an idea to make a stroller you could stand on			1
' we met with parents o talk about it and came up with the idea of a stroller combined with a long board			0
the wacky contraption consists of a longboard which has the seat section of a child 's buggy attached children between the ages of nine months and four - and - a - half years old can comfortably sit in the buggy ' with just a stroller alone you can travel maybe half a mile and this offers a solution to go further without having to use a car or another form of transport			1
' it 's also environmentally friendly which is one of the main points behind it			0
' to make the prototype we used part of an existing stroller and had a longboard made out of wood and fibreglass to make it stronger			2
' it can hold children from about nine - months - old up to four - and - a - half years , with a maximum weight of around 2st 7lbs			0
' adults stand on the back and use the handles to steer or they can lean from side to side which also changes the direction			0
' we are currently thinking about safety features such as what kind of brake it needs , how to attach the children and board sizes			0
' it is difficult to say how much it will cost as it is not for sale yet but a good longboard costs up to £ 300 so it will be a bit more than that with the extra parts			1
' the product has also been enhanced with a brake at the back and handlebars for steering			0
