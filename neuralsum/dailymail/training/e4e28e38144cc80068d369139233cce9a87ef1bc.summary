the probes are at the preliminary stage , but @entity0 , in releasing yearly results monday , noted requests from the @entity44 and the @entity46 over the precious metals probe , the @entity50 said			1
a trove of leaked documents shows that @entity0 's @entity59 private bank turned a blind eye to illegal activities of arms dealers and blood diamond traders while helping rich people evade taxes , according to a report based on the documents that was published earlier this month			1
the data relate to accounts worth £ 650billion held by more than 100,000 people and legal entities around the world			0
what happened a former @entity0 employee - turned - whistleblower , @entity75 , gave the data to @entity77 tax authorities in 2008			1
@entity77 shared it with other governments and launched investigations			0
the @entity77 newspaper @entity81 obtained a version of the data and shared the material with the @entity84 , which analyzed the material together with @entity86 and the @entity87			0

why it matters though some of the details of such operations were disclosed previously , when @entity0 was fined in 2012 by the @entity2 for allowing criminals to use its branches for money laundering , the new information suggests @entity0 took an active role in assisting the wealthy in hiding their money from authorities			1
' the bank repeatedly reassured clients that it would not disclose details of accounts to national authorities , even if evidence suggested that the accounts were undeclared to tax authorities in the client 's home country , ' the consortium said			0
' bank employees also discussed with clients a range of measures that would ultimately allow clients to avoid paying taxes in their home countries			2
' @entity151 , a professor of accounting at the @entity153 , said this case was different than other recent tax scandals			0
' @entity0 has been complicit in clear tax evasion and law breaking rather than legitimate tax avoidance , ' he said			1
potential fallout the disclosures could see governments step up their efforts to prosecute tax evaders and the bank itself			0

' you are left wondering , as you see the enormity of what has been going on , what it actually takes to bring a tax cheat to court , ' @entity182 , chair of @entity184 's @entity183 , told the @entity87			0
@entity182 said the former chairman of @entity0 , @entity192 , must face questions about whether he was ' asleep at the wheel , or he did know and he was therefore involved in dodgy tax practices			2
' in @entity197 , an investigating judge is considering arrest warrants against some former and current officials of the @entity0 bank if cooperation in an investigation on the @entity59 operations does not improve			1
what @entity0 says @entity0 stressed that the documents were from eight years ago and said it has since implemented initiatives designed to prevent its banking services from being used to evade taxes or launder money			1
@entity210 , ceo of @entity0 's @entity59 subsidiary , said the new management had shut down accounts from clients who ' did not meet our high standards			1
' ' these disclosures about historical business practices are a reminder that the old business model of @entity59 private banking is no longer acceptable , ' he said in a statement			2

it is being carried out by the @entity44 with help from @entity46 @entity33 paid £ 290million in penalties to @entity2 and @entity9 regulators in june 2012 to settle libor rate - rigging claims			2

an electronic daily silver price benchmark is now administered by @entity279 and @entity280 , while the @entity281 provides twice - daily benchmark platinum and palladium prices			1
