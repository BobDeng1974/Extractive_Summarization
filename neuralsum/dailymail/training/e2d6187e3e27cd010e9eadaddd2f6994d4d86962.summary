' i never imagined that doing the right thing as a cop could cost me so much , ' @entity10 , 31 , told the @entity33			2

but on october 27 , 2011 , everything changed – the dream becoming a total nightmare , he claims			2

desperate to get off the street , @entity61 kicked in the door of a nearby house and took refuge			0
the house happened to belong to the girlfriend of a @entity2 policeman called @entity71 , who naturally dialled 911			1
@entity61 was subsequently picked up – but then @entity71 showed up , while off duty , and was seen by @entity10 having a conversation with another officer , sergeant @entity74 , who was still at the scene			1

it was obvious not just to any cop but to any person that saw it what had just transpired			0

and , says @entity10 , there was no let up			0
he claims that someone set up a fake @entity126 account in his name , sending ' confessions ' to reporters that he was committing adultery , officers refused to accompany him on patrol and he was even ordered to retreat from the arrest of a drug dealer by his boss because no one would provide assistance			0
what 's more , he said , his security clearance was revoked , he was demoted to night - shift patrol work and his colleagues began to threaten him ahead of @entity71 and @entity74 ' trial , the pair having been charged over the assault in october 2012			1
on one disturbing occasion a sergeant rang him and said ' you better pray to @entity147 that you 're not the star witness ' , @entity10 told the @entity33			1
the abuse was n't confined to work , either , he alleges			0
after @entity152 on november 2012 someone placed a dead rat on the windshield of his car , while parked on the driveway of his home			1
@entity10 says that at this point his wife became ' hysterical '			0
promises that the perpetrators would be rooted out by police chief @entity162 came to nothing , @entity10 said			1
' how do you expect people to trust cops when they let this happen ? ' he said			0
after a trial in february 2014 in which @entity10 testified , @entity71 was found guilty of assault and obstruction of justice and jailed for 45 days and @entity74 found guilty of misconduct and put on probation			0

he is suing the @entity2 police department for $ 2.5million			1
@entity10 's attorney , @entity184 , said : ' actions like those taken within the @entity187 tarnish the badge of law enforcement , add to the growing tension between police and community , and form an ever more divisive sense of trust within the public at - large			1
' @entity0 acted in good faith , as any responsible individual citizen would , and we are proud to represent him for his courageousness in standing tall against poor judgment and inexcusable actions of his colleagues and superiors			1
