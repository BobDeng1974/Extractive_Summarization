by @entity0 published : 01:51 est , 2 december 2013 updated : 16:45 est , 2 december 2013 before the start of the @entity6 series last summer , one of @entity3 ’s back - room staff privately voiced concerns about two members of the @entity10 set - up			1
@entity11 , soon to replace @entity12 as coach , was one			2
the other was @entity15 , the bullocking but injury - prone fast bowler who until this year had never played more than three @entity19 in a row because his body simply could n’t stand the strain			1
@entity11 has since been credited with helping the @entity10 to relax , replacing video replays on the team bus of the side ’s latest match with music and cans of beer			2
and @entity15 , far from breaking down , is now on the verge of a sixth successive test			1
no worries : @entity10 skipper @entity33 is thought to be fine despite having trouble with his ankle in @entity36 24 - @entity15 's wickets in the summer @entity6 series			1
he was second only to @entity39 ( 26 ) , despite playing one test fewer			2
@entity41 of @entity15 's top 10 dismissals are @entity43 , including @entity44 ( 6 ) and @entity45 and @entity46 ( both 4 )			1
19.58 - @entity15 's average in the summer , considerably lower than @entity3 's top bowlers : @entity49 ( 27.45 ) , @entity39 ( 29.03 ) , @entity50 ( 29.59 ) , @entity51 ( 29.60 )			1
since the previous five , starting at @entity54 in july , have brought him 29 @entity43 wickets at under 19 apiece , the concerns of the back - room staffer have proved worryingly prescient			2
and any hopes @entity3 might have had of @entity15 sitting out what could be a gruelling test for fast bowlers on @entity36 ’s drop - in pitch appear to have been dashed by the fast bowler ’s insistence that he intends to approach the second test ‘ all guns blazing ’			1
one school of thought before this series suggested he would be allowed to sit out one of the five tests in order to ensure he was still charging in at 90mph at the series finale in @entity71 in the new year			2
but @entity15 insisted : ‘ i am not going to miss a test unless i have to			1
i have said since the start i am here to play five @entity19			2
@entity75 [ @entity11 ] has not mentioned one word about me resting which is good			2
i am feeling good and ready to go			2
’ all guns blazing : @entity15 , with team - mate @entity79 looking on , is declared he is ready to go against @entity3 in @entity36 most of the focus since @entity83 ’s 381 - run win at @entity84 has been on @entity85 , who claimed nine wickets in the match with his pace and hostility			1
but @entity15 took five himself , and is in the process of establishing strangleholds over all of @entity3 ’s major batsmen			1
in his five tests this year , he has dismissed @entity44 and @entity45 four times each , as well as @entity95 three times and @entity46 twice			0
and the absence of another regular victim , @entity98 ( four dismissals ) , has created a vacancy at @entity101 which the @entity10 are hoping will turn into a weakness			0
‘ it is a great loss with @entity104 not there , ’ said @entity15			1
‘ it is going to be interesting to see who they put in there			0
hopefully it will be @entity46 in there early , as it will give us a chance to get him out			0
whoever it is , @entity117 or @entity45 , they are both good players			0
’ whole new ball game : skipper @entity33 is all smiles as he passes a rugby ball during an @entity10 nets session danger man : @entity85 will look to repeat his first @entity19 success against @entity3 when the two sides met again this thursday at the @entity126 at @entity84 , where @entity85 was the bowler who most troubled @entity98 , it was easily forgotten that @entity15 had exposed his discomfort against the short ball during the summer			1
but he had only generous words for his opponent , who flew home last week because of a stress - related illness			0
‘ @entity98 has gone now , ’ he said			0
‘ i will be disappointed if anyone brings that up on the field			0
it is not a nice thing he is going through			0
all the boys who have commented on it have said we want @entity98 back playing cricket			0
‘ i know the @entity10 team does , because he is one of their best players and we want to play against their best team			2
he has made a big decision to go home and i would love to see him back playing soon			0
the @entity3 team needs him , but world cricket needs him too because he is a world - class player			0
’ @entity155 keepers : @entity156 is the centre of attention as @entity83 warm - up ahead of thursday 's second test @entity98 ’s departure , however , has not dimmed the hosts ’ competitive spirit			1
a frailty has been noted among the @entity3 batsmen , and – drop - in pitch or not – @entity83 ’s fast bowlers intend to exploit it			1
@entity15 said : ‘ @entity169 has already said he is not going to change the way he bowls			1
no matter what kind of wicket you are on , if you are bowling that quick the bouncers are either going to go over your head – or hit you if they do n’t bounce			0
’ meanwhile , @entity33 was said to be ‘ ok ’ by @entity176 after appearing to roll his right ankle during monday ’s training session at the @entity126			1
the @entity10 captain , who made a century at the @entity180 , came through nets practice after repeatedly flexing his right ankle during fielding drills , and is not thought to be in danger of missing the second test			1
@entity185 may be over , but @entity85 is expected to keep his terrifying tache for the rest of the @entity6			0
the paceman , who sported a @entity190 - style growth while taking nine wickets at the @entity180 , tweeted : ‘ should i keep the @entity192 ? ? well if we can raise $ 50,000 by dec 3 , i will keep it for the rest of the ashes series ! donate to my mo space			0
’ meanwhile , former @entity10 paceman @entity198 believes @entity3 flattered @entity85 in @entity84			0
he tweeted : ‘ of the 229 balls @entity85 bowled at the @entity180 , only 10 would have hit the stumps			0
@entity3 will have seen that			0

@entity15 set to play sixth successive test for @entity83
ankle injury fears for captain @entity33 are allayed
