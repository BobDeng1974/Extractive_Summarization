so before any more of the passages are destroyed by buldozers or dynamite , photographer @entity7 decided to take the plunge , literally , to explore these underground trade routes			1
he had to make an enormous effort to obtain a permit from the @entity16 - run interior ministry because there is a ban on photography in this area for apparent security reasons			1
underground : @entity7 took the plunge into the tunnels that are under threat from @entity2 snapshot : @entity28 tunnel workers rest at the entrance of a smuggling tunnel dug beneath the @entity6 - @entity2 border once he had the permit , he headed straight to the area where i was stopped at several police checkpoints before finally getting to one of the smuggling tunnels			1
writing on @entity39 , he said : ' it took me a few minutes to take in the area and see the real situation with my own eyes , not as it is described by others			2
' hundreds of tunnel entrances were covered by tents in an attempt to hide the location and @entity2 army tanks were close by , guarding the border			2
' i was surprised and a bit frightened to see a 20 meter - deep hole , and was n’t so happy about going down into the dark			2
@entity53 encouraged me , saying that you descend on a rope operated by an electric generator , assuring me that the rope was strong enough to carry heavy construction materials			2
' i tied my cameras around my body and the adventure began			0
' relaxed : a @entity28 tunnel worker lights a cigarette for his colleague inside a smuggling tunnel and seem at ease despite the obvious dangers down you go : a @entity28 tunnel worker is lowered on a rope into a smuggling tunnel once into the tunnel , @entity72 is warmly greeted by the workers down there who are busy repairing walls and realises that there is a whole maze of tunnels , operated by different groups			1
' it was not an easy hour , ' he added			0
' it was very hot and humid , and shooting pictures was very difficult due to the weak light			0
even breathing was not as easy as i thought			0
' the workers did n't appear afraid of the @entity2 security forces ' clampdown on using the tunnels , and certainly were n't put off their coffee breaks			1
the tunnel network was established as a result of a blockade intensified by @entity96 after the @entity16 movement seized @entity6 from its rival @entity98 in 2007			0
rest time : @entity2 security forces have stepped up a crackdown campaign on smuggling tunnels between @entity2 and the @entity6 since july @entity2 security forces have stepped up a crackdown campaign on smuggling tunnels since @entity2 ’s @entity105 president @entity104 was toppled last june			1
they are used to transfer cheap fuel and commercial goods into the @entity28 territory			0
pro-palestine campaigners say the crackdown is having dire consequences on people living in @entity6 who are now effectively locked in			0
as a result of the clampdown the costs of food and building materials are said to have risen have risen			0
the crackdown has also dealt a blow to @entity16 , which for years has collected taxes from the movement of goods through the tunnels .			1
