the @entity0 is set to bring in the biggest shake - up of the @entity2 since 1999 when a raft of new proposals are put to the vote			1
the @entity0 session in @entity7 is expected to agree to scrap the current limit of 28 sports in the summer olympics but maintain a maximum number of athletes at 10,500 - a decision which will put pressure on some of the bigger sports such as swimming and athletics to reduce the number of events			1
there are also proposals to make bidding to host @entity2 more attractive and less costly - something that was brought sharply into focus when it was announced only @entity24 and @entity25 are bidding for host the @entity27			0
the proposed changes are part of @entity0 president @entity31 's @entity30 2020 recommendations the proposals to be voted on during the session on monday and tuesday are contained within the @entity30 2020 recommendations being put forward by @entity0 president @entity31			2
there could be opposition to some measures however - senior @entity0 members believe there could be calls to reintroduce visits by members to bidding cities			1
these were banned following the @entity46 corruption scandal in 1999 , the last time the @entity0 brought in such significant changes			2
the decision by @entity31 to maintain an age limit of 70 for @entity0 members - with a few limited exceptions permitted - may also provoke opposition			1
in february , @entity53 president @entity52 , who is also an @entity0 member , called the limit ' discrimination '			2
@entity31 proposed that the number of sports should increase but the number of athletes should remain the same @entity52 , 78 , said then : ' imposing an age limit is an act of discrimination			1
what needs to be changed can be done by a democratic way			0
' simply do not elect a member not because of age but because they are not able to do the work			0
it is not normal to impose age limits			0
' changes to @entity0 bidding rules could also make it easier for countries in very hot climates to win the right to host the summer games , by allowing it to be staged at different times of year to the traditional july / august slot , and with more flexibility in putting on some events in a different city or even different country			1
if passed , the new rules mean the contest for the @entity87 could feature two cities from the @entity89 including @entity91 capital @entity90			0
@entity53 president and @entity0 member said the proposed age limits for members was ' discrimination ' @entity0 member @entity97 , from @entity98 , said last month he expects one or two bids from the @entity89 for 2024			2
prince @entity100 said : ' we have already seen in the @entity102 we have an @entity104 country that looked to be a candidate city to host the @entity2 and for 2024 we expect other @entity89 countries that might consider putting themselves forward			0
' i would expect that we will find one or two countries will be putting themselves into the bidding process and it is a question of what they have and what it takes to meet the @entity0 requirements and whether they deserve the opportunity to host the @entity2			0

@entity0 set to announce shake - up of the games
number of sports , currently 28 , will be increased
but number of athletes will remain set at 10,500
this means some sports may have to reduce the number of events
