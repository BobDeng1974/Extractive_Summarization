officials are concerned that the black market for marijuana in @entity3 is undiminished following a series of violent incidents during illegal transactions of the drug			1
as the country 's first state to legalize marijuana , @entity3 is being closely observed to determine the effect of legalization on marijuana - related crime			1
under @entity3 law , it is legal to possess up to one ounce of marijuana , but authorities fear the measures could embolden illegal dealers and buyers , who believe they can escape prosecution			1
drug - related death : this photo provided by @entity27 shows @entity28 , 25 , who was shot dead trying to sell marijuana the old - fashioned , illegal way while no one expected the state 's first - in - the - nation recreational sales would eliminate the need for dangerous underground sales overnight , the violence has raised concerns among police , prosecutors and pot advocates that a black market for marijuana is alive and well in @entity3			1
a 25 - year - old is shot dead trying to sell marijuana the old - fashioned , illegal way			1
two men from @entity46 set up a warehouse to grow more than they would ever need			0
and three people buying pot in a grocery store parking lot are robbed at gunpoint			0
' it has done nothing more than enhance the opportunity for the black market , ' said lieutenant @entity56 of the @entity58 police vice and narcotics unit			1
' if you can get it tax - free on the corner , you 're going to get it on the corner			0
' marijuana crime : @entity65 , along with @entity66 and @entity67 was charged with felony first - degree murder , robbery and aggravated motor - vehicle theft in the death of 25 - year - old @entity28 it 's difficult to measure whether there has been an increase in pot - related crimes beyond anecdotal reports because no one at either the federal or state levels is keeping track of the numbers of killings , robberies and other crimes linked directly to marijuana			1
pot advocates say the state is in a transition period , and while pot - related crimes will continue , they will begin to decline as more stores open and prices of legal marijuana decline			1
' it 's just a transition period , ' activist @entity92 said			1
' @entity95 was illegal for the last 80 years in our state , and there are some remnants of that still around			1
certainly , much like alcohol , over time these underground dealers will fade away			2
' sales are due to begin in june in @entity104 , where authorities will be watching for similar cases			2
' there 's going to be a black market here , ' said commander @entity110 of the @entity111 , which covers an area outside @entity113			1
' there will be drug rip - offs and drug debts that have n't been paid			0
all of that is going to stay			0
' suspect : @entity28 was allegedly on his way to meet @entity66 ( pictured ) to ' conduct a marijuana transaction ' at 7 pm january 21			2
his body was discovered two months later under @entity3 's voter - approved law , it is legal to possess up to an ounce of marijuana			1
authorities are concerned that means illegal dealers and buyers believe they can avoid prosecution			2
these dealers and their customers also tend to be targets , if robbers know they are flush with cash			0
@entity135 , outside @entity136 , has seen ' a growing number of drug rips and outright burglaries and robberies of people who have large amounts of marijuana or cash on them , ' said district attorney @entity146			2
his district has seen at least three homicides linked to pot in recent months and a rising number of robberies and home invasions			0
among them was a february case in which a 17 - year - old boy said he accidentally shot and killed his girlfriend while robbing a man who had come to purchase weed			2
elsewhere , prosecutors say , @entity28 , 25 , was killed during a january drug deal when he was robbed and shot , and his body dumped in @entity163			0
the next month , a dealer mugged three people who were trying to buy marijuana from him in a @entity136 grocery store parking lot			2
such deals are the exception , said @entity92			0
the ' average customer ' prefers to buy in a well - lit , regulated store , he said , citing the roughly $ 2 million @entity3 made in marijuana taxes in january alone			1
whether dangerous or not , it can still be cheaper to buy pot from a drug dealer			0
voters who approved recreational sales in @entity3 also agreed to a 12.9 per cent state sales tax and a 15 per cent excise tax on it			1
local jurisdictions can also add their own taxes			0
medical marijuana is taxed , too , but at a much lower rate - a 2.9 per cent sales tax			1
those taxes mean an ounce of pot can go for $ 400 or more at a state - sanctioned store , depending on quality and potency			2
an ounce on the street can run between $ 200 and $ 280 , depending on how much a dealer wants to profit , @entity56 said			0
underground dealers also are not burdened by complex regulations and licenses			0
' those barriers to entry already create the potential for the black market , and then you add these taxes on top of it , and it makes it impossible to get rid of , ' said @entity136 attorney @entity207 , who helped write the pot legalization measure but opposed the taxes			1
@entity207 , who has long represented marijuana dealers facing criminal charges , said his clientele has hardly diminished			2
@entity56 's unit recently searched a warehouse where two men from @entity46 were growing ' so much more than they could ever need , ' he said			0
detectives charged them with possession of pot with intent to distribute			0
drug deal gone bad : @entity222 , along with @entity66 and @entity65 are charged with felony first - degree murder , robbery and aggravated motor - vehicle theft in the death of 25 - year - old @entity28 if some @entity3 drug dealers have lost business to legal retailers , some also have made up for it by transporting weed to other states			1
a @entity235 man was arrested in march after postal inspectors intercepted a package he was mailing containing a pound of pot. drug task force officers who later searched his home found scores of gallon - sized bags of marijuana and 76 plants			0
marijuana cases can be hard to prosecute and are not cost - effective , so police often prefer to focus attention on drugs like heroin and methamphetamine , @entity56 said			0
one result , he said , is the feeling among illegal dealers that because retail sales are legal , authorities are looking the other way			2
@entity258 , a public policy professor at the @entity259 , @entity260 , who is helping @entity104 set up its legal marijuana industry , said the black market 's survival has less to do with taxes than with a shortage of legal stores			1
@entity3 has more than 160 state - licensed stores , but they remain concentrated in the @entity136 area			1
many towns do n't have any			0
' when there are more stores and more products in the stores and prices settle down , then we 'll see , ' @entity258 said			0
' i would be very surprised if the illicit market can compete at all			0

the crimes have raised concerns that a black market for the illegal marijuana is *thriving* in the state
