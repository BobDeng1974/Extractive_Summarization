this man , known only as @entity1 , had his sentence for carrying a knife delayed so he could go on holiday , where he was involved in a fatal stabbing a convicted thug ’s sentence for carrying a knife was delayed so that he could go on holiday abroad – where he was then involved in the fatal stabbing of a @entity13 teenager			1
the 19 - year - old was given a ten - week curfew and ordered to wear a tag at all times by district judge @entity18			1
but @entity19 can now reveal he then permitted an 11 - day suspension , so the youth could go on holiday			2
four days later , the youth – referred to only as ‘ x ’ for legal reasons – was involved in a brawl outside a bar in @entity29 , @entity30 , during which @entity31 , from @entity32 , @entity33 , was fatally stabbed through the heart			1
@entity31 ’s mother , @entity35 , says she is ‘ shocked ’ by the revelation and one family source says , had the curfew not been suspended , her son may have still been alive , as @entity1 played a ‘ crucial role ’ in the brawl			1
@entity1 , who has been charged with affray by @entity45 police , was one of 17 @entity13 youths arrested in connection with the brawl			1
police in @entity29 are still unclear as to what triggered the brawl outside the @entity53 in the early hours of july 22 last year			1
@entity54 , a lawyer in @entity55 acting for ms @entity35 , said @entity31 and his friends and members of @entity1 ’s group were all inside the bar when an argument broke out , possibly over a girl			1
it appears that when @entity31 – who was in @entity30 to celebrate his 19th birthday – was leaving the bar , he was set upon by the group and stabbed			1
despite paramedics ’ attempts to save him , he died at the scene			2
within hours , @entity45 police had arrested 17 @entity13 youths in the resort , some with blood still smeared on their clothes			1
had the incident taken place in @entity13 , the entire group could have been charged with murder under the law of joint enterprise , in which all gang members are responsible for a murder even if one person struck the fatal blow			2
this concept does not exist in @entity45 law			1
the thug ( left ) has now been charged with affray after @entity31 died after a knife attack outside a club in @entity29 , @entity45			1
@entity89 ( right ) has been charged with the killing one of @entity31 ’s alleged attackers , @entity89 , 19 , from @entity92 , @entity93 , has been charged with murder , which he denies			1
two others – @entity96 , 19 , and @entity97 , 19 – have been charged with being accomplices to murder			2
five more – including ‘ x ’ – have been charged with affray			2
they have been allowed to return to the @entity13 until a trial date is set			0
@entity89 , 19 , from @entity92 , @entity93 , denies the murder the @entity19 has seen a confidential letter from the @entity105 to @entity107 mp @entity106 , in which justice minister @entity108 reveals judge @entity18 ’s extraordinary decision			1
‘ i am extremely concerned , ’ said @entity111 , the mp for @entity112			2
‘ this man was sentenced for the possession of a knife , and then allowed to go on holiday where he became involved in an incident where someone was stabbed to death			1
questions need to be asked			1
’ @entity1 appeared before judge @entity18 at @entity121 ’ @entity122 in @entity123 on july 17 last year			1
according to mr @entity108 ’s letter and a separate summary of the proceedings obtained by this newspaper from the court , @entity1 was arrested twice on the same day a week earlier in separate incidents in the @entity131 area of @entity93			1
he was charged with cannabis possession and for carrying a folding pocket knife with a 3in blade			1
@entity1 pleaded guilty to both charges in court			1
judge @entity18 did not sentence him for the cannabis possession but imposed a ten - week - long curfew , requiring he wear a tag and remain inside his house between 8pm and 6am each night			2
he ordered that the sentence start immediately , but @entity1 ’s lawyer asked if it could be suspended between july 19 - 30 so x could go on a pre-booked holiday			1
four days later , @entity1 was in @entity29 with at least eight friends			1
@entity147 , the chairman of the @entity148 , added : ‘ this is an extraordinary case			0
the judge ’s decision to suspend a curfew to enable a defendant to go on holiday has been most unwise			1
the lord chief justice should revisit sentencing guidelines to ensure these circumstances are never repeated			0
’ writing in this newspaper today , @entity31 ’s mother , a 43 - year - old housing officer , said : ‘ this is a complete shock			1
how can a judge allow a person convicted of such a serious offence to go on holiday before serving their sentence ? ’ since his return to the @entity13 , @entity1 has been arrested in @entity168 for possession of cannabis as well as a fraud - related offence			1
crime scene : police are still at a loss as to exactly what started the brawl outside the @entity53 ( pictured ) on july 22 last year but believe an argument may have started over a girl in may , police in @entity181 charged him with possession of heroin and crack cocaine			2
he is on bail while he awaits trial			0
this weekend judge @entity18 – who was appointed in 2004 and sits in courts in @entity93 – could not be contacted for comment			2
a spokesman for the @entity191 , which acts of behalf of judges , said : ‘ judges are obliged to follow sentencing guidelines			0
' court documents show that the defendant had immediately pleaded guilty to possession of cannabis and a knife			2
he had no previous convictions			0
he had been on bail since his arrest and had committed no further offences			0
’ my son was killed on his 19th birthday ... i need to know why , by @entity35 what does it mean to lose a child to a senseless murder ? how do i feel ? imagine your child , cold and unresponsive to your touch			0
imagine wanting to celebrate their birthday , only for it to be the date of their death			0
i sent my son on holiday , not to war			2
@entity31 was in @entity29 , @entity30 , celebrating his 19th birthday with friends and due home two days later			1
on july 21 , the day before his birthday , we spoke on the phone			0
he said he was having a good time			0
i told him i loved him and to take care			0
mother @entity35 ( left ) with her ' precious son ' @entity31 ( right ) who was stabbed to death on holiday next day i tried to call to wish him happy birthday but kept getting his voicemail			1
i was not worried , i assumed he ’d been out the night before and was sleeping			0
i headed off to work and , at lunchtime , went shopping			0
i was at the chemists when my world was destroyed			0
my nephew called with the news : ‘ @entity31 was injured in a fight			1
’ ‘ is he ok ? ’ i murmured			0
silence , then : ‘ no , i do n’t think so			0
’ in the middle of boots , in @entity243 , @entity33 , i started to scream and fell to my knees			0
a security guard came to my aid and soon my colleagues and two police officers were by my side			0
two more officers arrived and said @entity31 had been stabbed to death outside a club in @entity29 on his 19th birthday			1
in the immediate aftermath , the press described it as a gang - fight			0
but this was contrary to @entity31 ’s values and beliefs			1
he was charming and handsome – he could light up a room			0
he seemed confident , but was actually slightly shy and very humble			0
two days later , i went to @entity45 to identify his body			1
in the hospital mortuary , i held him , willing him to wake up , praying he would open his eyes when he realised @entity265 was there			0
i touched his wounds , kissed his face and held his hands			0
the nightmare was finally real			0
i returned to the @entity13 , and went to collect my daughter @entity272 , then five , from her grandmother			0
‘ where ’s @entity276 ? ’ she asked , looking behind me			2
i could not find the words to tell her , so just said he was n’t here			0
the disappointment in her face broke me			0
it is a year since @entity31 ’s precious life was cut short			1
his death was senseless , brutal and unnecessary			0
why would anyone want to hurt him ? how can people go on holiday armed with knives ? how could they leave him in the street to die ? last week , my local mp @entity106 told me one of the men involved in the brawl leading to my son ’s death was convicted of carrying a knife four days earlier			1
yet a judge suspended his ten - week - long curfew for almost two weeks so he could go on holiday			2
this is a complete shock			0
how can a judge allow a person convicted of such a serious offence to go on holiday before serving their sentence ? i am hurt and disappointed			2
hurt , because there is no deterrent for such offences			0
disappointed because it is a slap in the face for all the families of other young stabbing victims			2
it does not bode well for the future			0
judges must be tough on all knife crime , for the sake of society			2

thug , known as @entity1 , was due to be sentenced for carrying a knife last year
however judge delayed it so *criminal* could go on holiday to @entity29 , @entity45
while there he was involved in fatal stabbing of @entity31
mp @entity106 says questions need to be asked over @entity340 *'s* decision
