by @entity0 published : 07:14 est , 9 may 2012 updated : 09:00 est , 9 may 2012 more than 100 city bankers today won their @entity3 battle for £ 42million in unpaid bonuses from the @entity6 banking giant @entity5 they had accused the bank of broken promises over their share of a guaranteed bonus pool announced by @entity12 in august 2008			1
the case comes at a time of continuing political and public anger at fat cat bank bonuses			1
but mr @entity19 said while the subject of such bonuses was a matter of public interest , these claims depended on a contractual clause and did not involve the wider concerns in the banking industry today			1
more than 100 @entity28 investment bankers today won their @entity3 battle for £ 42m in unpaid bonuses from @entity5 the individual claims brought by 104 former @entity13 employees against the company and its new owner - which bought it in 2009 - ranged from £ 12,000 to £ 1.6milion			1
in january , @entity36 told mr @entity19 the bonuses should have been paid for the year ending december 31 , 2008 , from a guaranteed minimum bonus pool of £ 320million because of ' binding and enforceable contractual promises ' made between august and december 2008			1
they were to be allocated to front - and middle - office employees in the usual way , taking into account individual performance , and paid in full in cash in january 2009			2
' put briefly , those promises have not been honoured and that is why we are here today , ' he said			2
' although the defendants accept that the statements which we rely upon were made , they deny that they amounted to contractual obligations			2
' mr @entity55 said the pool was created in august 2008 in order to retain staff in the face of a mass exodus , and was formally communicated to them by dr @entity62 , then chief executive of @entity63			2
@entity64 , ceo of @entity5 , said : ' if the court rules that it was contractually binding , of course i will accept it and pay ' dr @entity62 said the pool would remain ' no matter what ' , irrespective of financial performance			1
mr @entity55 said the promises made by dr @entity62 were aimed at stabilising the investment banking division and had that effect - all of the claimant bankers did stay and continued to work hard			1
but , having allocated discretionary bonuses from the pool in december 2008 , the bank subsequently decided to ' move the goalposts ' and introduce a material adverse change ( @entity83 ) clause			2
@entity5 vigorously defended the claims , saying that @entity85 was entitled to reduce the bonuses in the light of the significant deterioration in the investment bank 's performance in late 2008			1
it said that the august announcement was neither intended to have contractual effect - nor had such effect - but amounted to no more than the provision of information as to the bank 's genuine intentions , while the claimants merely continued to do the jobs they were well paid to do			0
the judge said that he was satisfied that the promise made by dr @entity62 gave rise to a contractual obligation			0
the average pay of bosses at @entity107 ’s biggest public companies rose by 11 per cent last year to £ 3.65million , according to research published yesterday			1
the study , compiled for the @entity110 by @entity111 , the adviser to shareholders , looked at the annual reports of 60 of the companies in the @entity116			0
on average , a chief executive gets a basic annual salary of £ 840,000 , a long - term incentive plan of £ 1.14million , a cash bonus of £ 689,000 plus several other lucrative perks , according to the research			1
but the average worker in the private sector is losing ground , according to a report from the pay experts @entity128			0
the average pay rise handed out by bosses to their cash - strapped workers between january and @entity133 was 3 per cent , it says			0
it comes at a time when inflation is 3.5 per cent			0
the report found that 8 per cent of workers , who typically are employed in manufacturing , construction or the not - for - profit sector , had their pay frozen			0
if the claimants had not won on that point , they would have succeeded on the @entity83 clause issue which , he added , was introduced in breach of the implied terms of the contracts of employment			0
today , the judge said : ' i have come to the conclusion that the claimants are entitled to payment of bonuses provisionally awarded to them			0
' i would simply add that , whilst these claims arose in 2008 against the background of the major crisis in the international banking industry and whilst the subject of bonuses paid to those employed in the banking sector remains a subject of intense public interest , the issues to which these claims gave rise arose within a narrow ambit and concern the nature and existence of contractual obligations owed to the claimants by their employer			2
' they did not concern wider issues as to the structure of remuneration within the banking industry			0
' during the hearing , @entity5 ceo @entity64 said : ' if the court rules that it was contractually binding , of course i will accept it and pay			1
' however , a spokesman for the bank said later : ' we are disappointed with the court ’s decision and will seek leave to appeal			0
' the bank believes that the decision to reduce discretionary bonuses in light of £ 5.2billion of losses at @entity12 for 2008 was responsible and justified			1
' the main argument revolves around whether the announcement on august 18 amounted to a legally binding agreement			0
' it is the @entity63 ’s submission that there is every prospect that the @entity205 would come to a different view on this matter			0
' as well as being ordered to pay the bonuses , @entity5 could face a legal bill of up to £ 20million for a hearing lasting more than three weeks			1
but they immediately announced plans to appeal			0
later , @entity213 , a partner at law firm @entity214 , which represented 21 of the claimant bankers , said : ' we welcome the @entity3 's decision today confirming the @entity63 's contractual obligation to pay retention awards promised to our clients in exceptional circumstances in 2008			2
' @entity12 made repeated promises to employees prior to its sale to @entity5 in an attempt to avoid a mass exodus of staff - namely that they would be financially rewarded from a guaranteed retention pool for remaining at the bank and performing well			1
' we welcome the @entity3 ruling that these promises constituted a binding contract and , with the staff having performed their side of the contract , that the bank breached it by refusing to honour the payments it had promised			0
' this case is likely to have significance whenever employment contracts are varied , particularly on the basis of verbal commitments or actions .			2
