by @entity1 reporter published : 11:11 est , 17 august 2012 updated : 11:30 est , 18 august 2012 the medical world has long debated whether copper can help ease the pain of arthritis			1
while some sufferers swear by a bracelet , others use expensive insoles			0
@entity10 , however , reckons he ’s found the cheapest aid of all – 2p pieces glued to the inside of his shoes			1
happy man : @entity10 , 85 , a retired performer , is celebrating being able to walk again after supergluing two pence coins to the inside of his shoes the 85 - year - old has been crippled by arthritis for 15 years and could barely bend his knees without feeling excruciating pain			1
but he had a flash of inspiration after reading about the apparent benefits of walking on copper			1
unable to afford the £ 30 cost of specially made insoles , he came up with his own version by glueing four 2p pieces to a cheap shoe protector			0
those 2p coins minted before 1992 are 97 per cent copper			1
only four weeks later , the father of two – who was an entertainer during @entity35 – claims he has been ‘ cured ’			1
he said : ' at first my arthritis came and went , but in the last couple of years it got really bad			0
' i thought “ i wonder whether the copper in 2p pieces could help me ? ” after a few weeks i thought “ wow , this really works ”			1
' now walking is a pleasure and i can move around unlike before			0
' i am walking without any pain and i can lift my leg half way up my body and kick out			0
' cheap and cheerful : mr @entity10 has put 8p in each shoe and is reaping the rewards mr @entity10 , of @entity51 , @entity52 , was a teenager during the war and travelled around @entity55 barracks in the @entity56 and @entity57 performing the violin and singing as part of the @entity61			1
after marrying his wife of 61 years @entity63 , 81 , he went on to run his own business selling jukebox records , before retiring and filling his time with charity work			0
mr @entity10 lost his mobility when he developed arthritis in 1997 and was left struggling to bend his knees without being in terrible pain			1
when he saw the advert for copper insoles he tried putting 2p pieces in his socks – but the coins uncomfortably moved around			2
he later came up with the idea of glueing them on to some £ 3 insoles			0
copper is an essential nutrient for the body and critical for bone development and nerve function			2
at least 20 per cent of the population suffers from copper deficiency , particularly older people			2
some firms claim that putting copper next to the skin allows it to be absorbed and circulated through the body to relieve inflammation and pain			2
better than the real thing ? these copper soles inspired @entity10 to try his own because he could n't afford them professor @entity98 , medical director of @entity99 said : ‘ when copper comes into contact with sweat , copper salts seep from the insoles and some of these salts may be absorbed via the skin			1
‘ however there ’s no evidence that arthritis is caused by a shortage of copper in your body and it is not known whether the absorption of copper salts genuinely impacts on arthritis pain			2
’ formal trials examining the benefits of copper are now under way at the @entity123			0
professor @entity124 , of the @entity125 in @entity52 , said : ‘ i feel that copper has helped my arthritis			0
' i am convinced there is something in the copper or there is a tremendous placebo effect			0
' director of @entity135 , @entity136 , who invented the specialist copper insoles seven years ago , said : ' the problem with coins is they are not 100 per cent copper so this man will not be getting the full benefit of the mineral			0

@entity10 , 85 , read that copper could help him bend his knees so stuck some in his *trainers*
he said he could n't bend his knees but a month after wearing the shoes he is ' cured '
experts are split on whether his new soles are actually working
