by @entity0 schools are being forced to raid budgets earmarked for teaching and equipment to pay for @entity6 ’s free meals pledge			1
headteachers have rubbished claims that the policy is properly funded , saying they have had to dip into existing budgets to provide freezers , ovens and tables			1
one head is having to find £ 10,000 out of his existing budget to fund a fridge to store dozens of free sandwiches			1
another is still waiting to hear if a £ 65,000 kitchen extension will be built			0
the government has pledged £ 2.30 per pupil for free lunches , but heads are complaining the money is n't enough , with one having to use £ 10,000 out of his existing budget to fund them there have also been suggestions that schools could be forced to divert so - called ‘ pupil premium ’ funds – intended to support the poorest pupils – to help fund the scheme			1
mr @entity6 has insisted that ‘ the resources are there ’ for schools to provide free lunches for four to seven - year - olds from september			1
but headteachers are coming forward to warn they are having to make deep cuts elsewhere in their budgets to fulfil the duty			2
the free meals policy has provoked a fierce row in the @entity44 , with @entity46 officials giving the plan a ‘ red ’ rating over implementation concerns			1
the legal requirement for the meals to be hot has also been quietly dropped – meaning that some schools could ditch providing hot meals altogether so they have time to prepare basic cold food for all their pupils			2
the warnings from heads will worry education secretary @entity58 , who said in a leaked letter to the @entity60 last year that learning budgets must not be used to pay for the policy			1
however one head disclosed that even funding cold meals for pupils will take £ 6,000 from his teaching budget , on top of a £ 4,000 council grant , to buy a fridge to keep the food cool			1
@entity6 has insisted ' the resources are there ' to provide free lunches for four to seven - year - olds from september with £ 50,000 provided to fund the meals themselves , @entity74 , of @entity75 in @entity76 , said the policy amounted to ‘ £ 56,000 being spent to give children a sandwich ’			1
he added : ‘ give me £ 56,000 to spend in other ways and i could transform the educational chances of children at this school			0
’ the government will provide a flat rate of £ 2.30 for each meal			0
but mr @entity74 said the figures ‘ do not add up ’ for his school			0
‘ £ 2.30 would not cover a hot service			0
with the cold service we can just make it work , ’ he said			0
the @entity44 has announced £ 150million to help schools prepare their cooking facilities , on top of around £ 1billion to provide the meals themselves			2
but @entity98 , head of @entity99 , in @entity100 , said he was only receiving 50 per cent of the money he needs to fund new freezers and ovens			0
‘ i do n’t disagree with giving the meals			0
i do disagree with them saying it ’s fully funded , ’ he said			0
at @entity108 in @entity109 , a £ 65,000 kitchen extension is needed but headteacher @entity110 is still waiting to hear if it will be funded by the local authority			0
two primary schools in @entity114 have also been forced to deny that they were planning to use pupil premium money to fund the meals service .			2

@entity6 pledged free meals for four to seven - year - olds from september
*deputy* prime minister insists ' resources are there ' for the lunches
but heads say they are being forced to raid existing budgets for funding
