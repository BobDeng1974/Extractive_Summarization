but @entity21 soon made it clear that he wanted her to stop modeling			1

i was shocked because he ’d known me for three years and during all that time i ’d made no secret of my modeling			0
‘ he said it was disrespectful to pose for other men now we were a couple			0
’ at first she refused to quit but @entity21 made it clear there was no future unless she did			2
@entity13 says : ‘ i was young and in love and thought i had met the man i would spend my life with			1
i was reluctant but i knew all relationships come with some sacrifice			0
‘ if it was going to work i had to respect the fact that our cultures were very different and my career was a problem			0
’ she quit photo shoots and instead took on more hours at the supermarket			0
but it was n’t long before he was making more demands			0

he said i needed to pay more respect to the @entity10 culture for us to be together			0

she says : ‘ it felt like all the sacrifices i had made for the relationship were worth it because we were going to get out happy ending			2
‘ i was in love and now we decided to have a baby			2

when @entity21 ended all contact , a worried @entity13 began contacting his family , only to be told to leave @entity21 alone because he was already married she says : ‘ i was frantic with worry			1
my first thought was that he had been hurt			0

@entity13 says : ‘ i was so shocked i could not speak			2
i just stared at the screen thinking it must be a mistake			0
i thought i had known everything about him			0
after that all contact ended but @entity13 still treasured the idea of becoming a mother			1
but tragically she miscarried four months into the pregnancy blaming the stress			1
