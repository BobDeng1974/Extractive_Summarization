by @entity0 published : 20:35 est , 7 january 2014 updated : 07:29 est , 8 january 2014 the introduction of 5p plastic bag charge should be brought forward amid hopes it will drastically cut the number and raise £ 70million a year for good causes , say mps			2
current government policy means the 5p charge will not be introduced in @entity11 until october 2015 at the earliest			1
however , mps on the @entity13 ( @entity14 ) say they are ‘ disappointed ’ at the delay and want a speedier launch			1
current government policy means the 5p charge will not be introduced in @entity11 until october 2015 at the earliest @entity18 introduced a 5p charge in october 2011 , while @entity20 followed suit in april 2013 and @entity22 plans to do so in october this year			1
however , @entity24 ’s government has dragged its heels on implementing a charge , while it has also watered down the scheme for @entity11 , adding confusion and complexity			1
in the other nations , the 5p charge applies to all single use bags and across all retailers , regardless of the size of the business and number of stores			1
however , the charge in @entity11 will not apply to biodegradable or paper bags , while small shops employing less than 250 people will be exempt			2
@entity18 introduced a 5p charge in october 2011 , while @entity20 followed suit in april 2013 conservation and anti-litter campaigns have criticised the complex regime for @entity11 , saying it will be less effective in controlling the litter and waste caused by the bags			1
the big supermarkets are also critical , saying it will make their lives more difficult by having different rules for different parts of the @entity56			0
even the @entity57 , which represents corner shops , say it would be better if there was a single uniform scheme of bag charges that also applied to its members			0
the @entity14 committee is currently carrying out a short inquiry into the adoption of the 5p bag charge in @entity11 , however it has separately published an annual review saying it should be brought forward			1
the 11 man all - party committee is chaired by @entity72 mp , @entity72 , and includes five other conservatives			0
the review states : ‘ plastic bags are a major cause of seaborne pollution , and a serious hazard for marine life			0
‘ the government estimates that in 2012 , supermarkets gave out over eight billion single - use carrier bags across the @entity56 , equating to approximately 120 bags per person			2
‘ while the use of these plastic carrier bags in @entity11 has increased since 2010 , usage was cut dramatically by the @entity88 after charges were introduced in 2002			1
a similar charge in @entity20 has reduced carrier bag usage since april 2013			1
supermarkets in @entity18 reported a drop in use of up to 76per cent after a charging scheme was brought in two years ago			2
’ they add : ‘ we are pleased that the government has finally agreed to impose a charge for single - use plastic carrier bags in supermarkets and larger food retailers			1
however , we are disappointed that the charge will not come into effect in @entity11 until 2015 , despite evidence of its success in reducing plastic carrier bag usage in other parts of the @entity56 and @entity20			1
‘ reducing the number of single - use carrier bags which are given away is a quick win : reducing both waste and environmental pollution with little effort			0
‘ given the evidence elsewhere , we recommend the early introduction of the charge			2
’ environment minister , @entity118 , recently told @entity119 that the 5p for plastic bags will cut usage by 60 - 80 per cent and so vastly reduce pollution and litter			1
the resulting reduction in carbon emissions would be the equivalent of permanently taking up to 2.8million cars off the road , he said			0
the proceeds from the levy , which comes as victory for the @entity135 ’s @entity134 campaign , will be given to good causes			0
community organisations and charities will get up to £ 70million a year to deal with the impact of plastic pollution on wildlife and the environment			0
litter policy expert at the @entity144 , dr @entity145 , criticised the delay and complexity of the bag charging scheme planned for @entity11			2
‘ some totally superfluous and unhelpful exemptions have been brought in , which will cause confusion to retailers and consumers alike , ’ she said			0
she said the exemptions for paper bags and biodegradable bags are not justified , while the decision not to require charges at small stores is ‘ very worrying ’			0
‘ this could cause major confusion and headaches for retailers and for customers who wo n’t recognise what kind of business they are shopping in			0
surely giving a level playing field to all retailers is beneficial , ’ said dr @entity145			0
‘ we have a well understood and popular system already bedded in and working well in @entity18			2
having a different system in @entity11 is totally unnecessary and can only cause confusion all round			0

current government policy means the 5p charge will not be introduced in @entity11 until october 2015
@entity119 say they are ‘ disappointed ’ at the delay and want a speedier launch
@entity18 introduced a 5p charge in october 2011 , while @entity20 followed suit in april 2013
