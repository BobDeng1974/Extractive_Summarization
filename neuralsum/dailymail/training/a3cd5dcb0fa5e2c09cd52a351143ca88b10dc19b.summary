by @entity0 published : 10:22 est , 25 july 2013 updated : 01:20 est , 26 july 2013 what would @entity1 say ? a giant rooster - the symbol of @entity5 - has taken up a perch beneath the admiral 's statue in @entity9 , which celebrates @entity11 's 1805 defeat of @entity13 's armies			1
the 15.4ft fibreglass artwork took its place on the vacant @entity16 today and will stay up for 18 months			1
@entity18 's mayor @entity17 unveiled the ultramarine blue sculpture , named @entity20 , today alongside @entity22 artist @entity21			1
but it 's a nice humorous side - effect to have something @entity5 in a place that celebrates victory over @entity13 , ' @entity21 told @entity36 newspaper			1
she also said she hoped the double meaning in the work 's name would appeal to the @entity11 sense of humour			2
' i know they like to play games with language , ' @entity21 said , adding that her sculpture mocked male posturing in a square full of military statues			1
mr @entity17 told @entity48 : ' it is a ginormous blue @entity49 , as it 's called			1
' he also joked about @entity51 's plans to get internet providers to block pornography , saying : ' i think if you tried to @entity56 it in the future , the prime minister would stop you from finding it			0
' local conservation group @entity60 objected to the sculpture and had tried to block its display			2
' it is unrelated to the context of @entity9 and adds nothing to it but a feeble distraction , ' its members wrote in a letter to @entity69			0
the rooster is painted in ultramarine blue and made of fibreglass the large bird is a feathered friend for @entity9 's famous pigeons ' the only tenuous argument put forward is the artist ’s dubious claim that the “ cockerel is a symbol for regeneration , awakening and strength ”			2
' more to the point is that the artist boasts it is seen as “ a rude interruption to the grey formal architecture of the square ”			0
this is neither a happy nor pleasing criterion for the use of this most significant location			0
' @entity21 said @entity49 / @entity49 was a ' victory for feminism ' in the square			2
she told the @entity96 : ' i 'm a female sculptor			0
the man is the model			0
for thousands of years they 've made pictures of us , the women			0
i 've changed the role			0
' the statue was unveiled today on the @entity16 outside the @entity106 the newspaper 's contemporary art critic @entity107 said : ' @entity49 has a sense of mischief rather than posturing mockery			1
it is as much a celebration of the square as it is a satire			0
' the @entity16 was erected in 1841 for an equestrian statue that was never completed			0
it remained empty for a century and a half , and since 1999 has been occupied by artworks erected for 18 months at a time			1
they are paid for by the mayor 's office and @entity124			2
@entity21 's sculpture was chosen from a shortlist of six potential occupants			1
it follows works by the likes of @entity131 and @entity132 in finding a temporary home on the plinth			0
@entity20 will stay atop the @entity16 in @entity9 for 18 months the previous occupant , a boy on a rocking chair by @entity139 artists @entity140 , has been bought by the @entity141 in @entity142 , near @entity143 in @entity144			1
in 2009 , @entity146 's @entity145 saw 2,400 members of the public take it in turns to stand atop the plinth for an hour at a time			0
mr @entity17 said : ' @entity21 commands tremendous respect internationally and her giant blue bird will provide a striking new focal as well as talking point for @entity156 and tourists alike			1

sculpture called @entity20 by @entity21 will stay up for 18 months
it was unveiled today by @entity21 and @entity18 mayor @entity17
