by @entity0 for @entity1 graffiti has plummeted as youths take their anger away from spray cans and onto @entity8 , @entity7 's top police officer has claimed			1
sir @entity9 said social media has offered disaffected people a new platform to vent ideas which a decade ago ' would have been sprayed on the side of a building '			1
@entity7 officers have now seen vandalism , malicious damage and similar crimes halve in just five years , from 28,000 to less than 14,000			1
messy : graffiti on the walls of @entity22 in @entity23			1
@entity7 's top police officer has said daubings are becoming less common as disaffected youth take their grievances away from spray cans and onto @entity8 changing habits : sir @entity9 ( pictured ) said the number of traditional offences of vandalism is falling sir @entity9 told the @entity33 : ' social media in some instances has replaced graffiti as a way of making your views heard			1
' we have had to deal with offensive comments made on @entity8			1
my view is that ten to 15 years ago , that would have been sprayed on the side of a building			2
' the downward trend probably deserved to be studied for a university thesis , he added			0
despite the claim , graffiti has continued to be used as a way of getting political messages across			2
in protests against the rise in tuition fees in 2010 , students defaced @entity58 monuments including @entity59 and the statue of @entity61 with messages including ' education for the masses ' and ' * * * * the police '			0
and ' artistic ' graffiti has also seen a comeback , thanks partly the popularity of the mysterious @entity69 , whose career began in @entity71 and has brought him worldwide fame			2
political slogans : the statue of @entity61 in @entity58 's @entity75 after student protests in 2010 student anger : the lions of @entity58 's @entity80 also did not escape political slogans in 2010 protests political : the memorial to the 7/7 bombings in @entity58 was defaced on the attack 's ninth anniversary this year many artistic pieces of graffiti no longer form part of crime figures after councils and police began working with graffiti artists , handing them underpasses or walls where they can paint without fear of prosecution			1
when it came to gang slogans , sir @entity9 pinned the drop in offences on computer games			2
' we have a lot of success against gangs , ' he said			0
' some of it has been that the @entity110 and @entity111 generation is less of a gang generation			0
they are not out in the street so much			0
' you can correlate that with things like the general view that youth fitness is not where it was			0
' why ? because they are not out playing football to all hours of the day and night			0
they are inside on the @entity110 , but they are not outside , they are not doing the damage			0
' but he added : ' that takes us back to social media			1
people staying indoors may be committing some sorts of crimes like cybervandalism , but it is not visible to the rest of the community			0
' vandalism or art ? @entity69 's success has inspired others and taken his career as far as @entity143 ( pictured ) politics : campaigners defaced a string of pre-election @entity148 billboards			2
messages like this one now spread quicker on @entity8 - though a photograph of a real - life vandalised poster always helps sir @entity9 told the @entity33 , the force 's oversight body , that traditional vandalism , fire - raising , malicious damage , and similar crimes , had fallen dramatically in recent years			1
there were 13,453 such offences , most of which are against property , in april - june 2014 , committed across @entity7 in the first financial quarter of the year			1
that is down nearly eight per cent on the same period a year before , and the figure has more than halved since 2009 - 2010 , when it stood at 28,146			2
the chief constable added some of the fall was due to the force focusing on ' local policing and high - visibility patrols '			1
he said : ' we have seen a significant drop in anti-social behaviour and we see fewer complaints of drinking in public complaints			0
' some of these things tend to go with vandalism , graffiti and damage to property			2
' paint : despite graffiti artists being given designated walls , parts of cities remain daubed with gang slogans sir @entity9 also praised architects and designers for helping to make it harder to commit vandalism - and harder to break things			2
he said : ' i think we should also give credit to intelligent design as well			0
things are harder to vandalise than they used to be			0
' it is most cost - effective to build something that is difficult to vandalise , say a bus shelter , than it is to replace it			0
' police are now investigating more @entity8 crimes - although a recent investigation of racist abuse against an @entity212 - born @entity211 councillor , @entity210 , fell through after officers failed to obtain information from the social media giant			1
sir @entity9 stressed that abuse was abuse wherever it occurred			0
he said : ' when challenged , some people say ' i did n't say that , i put it on @entity8 '			1
well , it is the same as saying it			0
' @entity220 itself now has 571,610 followers on @entity8 - a rise of four per cent over the summer .			1

@entity7 's chief constable revealed offences have halved in just five years
' social media has replaced graffiti for making your views heard ' , he said
but officers have also investigated more posts on @entity8 and @entity236
