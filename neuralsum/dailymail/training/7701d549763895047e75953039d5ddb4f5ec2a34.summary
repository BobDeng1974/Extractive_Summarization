by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 19:11 est , 2 february 2014 @entity3 : 03:27 est , 3 february 2014 monday evening 's mouthwatering top - of - the - table clash between @entity5 and @entity6 could go some way to deciding who will win the @entity9			1
here @entity0 and @entity1 provide analysis on the game and discuss where they think it will be won and lost			1
how do @entity6 stop the @entity15 ? @entity5 have been scoring goals for fun so @entity6 will need to be organised and resolute			1
@entity5 will look to attack constantly so the @entity6 defence must keep up their concentration			1
prolific : @entity20 has already scored 24 goals for @entity5 this season double trouble city are one of the few teams to play with two strikers this season — though they did play just one when they last faced @entity6			1
defenders have become used to playing against a lone striker recently , so an old - fashioned double act provides a different challenge			0
@entity32 and @entity33 will relish it			0
@entity35 is missing , so his pace wo n’t hurt them but they will have a real battle with @entity20 and @entity40			2
city attack from every angle and love to whip crosses in so @entity32 and @entity33 will need to keep their shape , but their duel with @entity48 last week will have whet their appetite for a physical encounter			0
they can be sure of another titanic tussle			0
up for the challenge : @entity33 and @entity32 ( left ) will relish facing @entity20 and @entity40 the last time @entity56 took @entity6 to @entity5 was march 2007			1
the visitors won 1 - 0 with a @entity59 penalty			0
@entity5 ’s team featured @entity61 , @entity62 and @entity63			2
@entity5 finished 14th , 41 points behind @entity6			1
@entity65 finished the season as @entity5 ’s top scorer with eight			2
defensive screen @entity5 move the ball so quickly and try to get men between the opposition midfield and defensive lines as often as they can			2
@entity73 is a master in that position , so it ’s up to @entity6 to make sure they do n’t leave gaping holes and that the distance between defence and midfield is not too great			2
they need to protect their centre backs from the waves of @entity5 attacks and it will be up to the deeper midfielders to offer that buffer			2
@entity73 service : @entity73 is one man @entity6 must close down and not give any space to create chances verdict this has the makings of a classic game but @entity56 has a tactical dilemma on his hands			1
he was conservative playing away at @entity97 and @entity98 but that might not be enough here			0
if @entity56 gives his side the freedom to go for it , he has the players to cause @entity5 all sorts of problems , or he may choose to try and contain them			1
but the demolition job @entity5 are doing on other teams means the head - to - head encounters are now even more crucial			0
@entity6 have the players to win it and they ca n’t rely on other teams to stop @entity5			1
they have to do the job themselves			0
@entity112 is so consistent and i ’ve chosen a solid back four — @entity115 and @entity32 pick themselves			0
the midfield is full of pace and power , though @entity120 would play further forward			0
@entity73 and @entity121 offer more creativity and in the absence of the injured @entity35 , i ’d have @entity20 leading the line			1
solid foundations : @entity115 and @entity112 would be the heart of @entity1 's mixed team who will win the midfield battle ? @entity6 and @entity5 have two of the best midfields in the @entity9 , so expect fireworks			1
it ’s a crucial area of the pitch and whoever dominates the middle could win the game			0
win it on the wing for @entity6 to have success at the @entity141 , they will have to win the battle on the left flank			2
@entity144 : @entity5 's in - form man may be @entity20 , but @entity6 's is certainly @entity121 @entity121 is @entity56 ’s match - winner and it will be a fascinating contest between him and @entity148			1
the @entity149 will want to get forward as often as possible and run hazard into areas where he does n’t want to be			0
the risk with that is leaving space behind for the @entity155 to race into			0
@entity6 will likely play on the counter attack and if they can get the best out of @entity121 , then they have a real chance to win it			1
men in the middle the way @entity5 play , @entity6 should have an extra man in midfield			1
for 4 - 4 - 2 to work , you need two fit and powerful midfielders and , in @entity170 and @entity120 , @entity5 certainly have that			0
but if @entity6 get an extra man in there , do n’t be surprised if they try to take the sting out of the game with a deep - lying midfielder			1
@entity56 could use @entity176 or @entity177 , as he did against @entity97 last month , but , whoever he picks , the tactics of that protective role wo n’t change			2
muscle and finesse : @entity120 is the best example of a midfield powerhouse in the @entity9 tough job : @entity176 may be tasked with trying to stop @entity120 , @entity170 and @entity73 verdict @entity56 was very critical of @entity188 ’s defensive tactics last week but i ’ve no problem with sides defending like that away from home			1
it ’s only what @entity56 has done at @entity97 and @entity98 this season , and he could go the same way			0
i ’ve played in the middle and if you take command of that area of the pitch you can frustrate the opposition and the home fans			0
@entity56 has his favoured front players who he will want to win him the game but it will be in the middle of the park where the platform for victory is built for either side			1
@entity213 has come through a difficult period and is back in form , while @entity148 is a warrior and an easy pick			0
@entity5 ’s midfield two are a real force but with @entity73 further forward there ’s plenty of guile , too			0
hazard has to play , though i ’d have @entity222 and @entity35 , too , if they were fit			0
important players : @entity213 and @entity224 would both feature in @entity0 's mixed team			2

if @entity5 win they go back to the top of the @entity9
@entity1 says @entity6 have to somehow keep @entity20 quiet
he thinks @entity6 have to win to give themselves a shot at the title
@entity0 is sure @entity121 holds the keys for @entity56
former midfielder is *convinced* that 's where the game will be won or lost
neither man picks @entity243 in his combined team
