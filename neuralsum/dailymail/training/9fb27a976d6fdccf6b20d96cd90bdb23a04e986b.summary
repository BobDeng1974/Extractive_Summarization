these two sides will not be able to call each other @entity2 rivals for much longer but you suspect the fierce derby atmosphere witnessed here last night may endure for some years to come			2
this may have been an unwanted 5pm made - for - television kick - off but the intensity on display — both on and off the field — went some way towards eradicating any sunday night blues the crowd may have been feeling			2
even as the final whistle drew near , @entity15 centre @entity13 and his @entity17 counterpart @entity16 still somehow mustered the energy to scrap fiercely on the ground			1
the @entity15 player edged it			1
such was the nature of the game			0
@entity25 slides in to score his try during a stand - out performance for @entity15 against @entity17 despite an energy - sapping battle , @entity13 and @entity28 still had the strength for a late scrap in the end , it was @entity15 who deservedly recorded their second successive @entity35 win and they enter the autumn international period top of @entity37			1
@entity38 - bound @entity17 finished with their second losing bonus point but it was @entity15 who disappeared into the @entity42 night feeling as confident as they have done at any point this season			1
‘ i ’m delighted with that performance in so many ways , ’ said @entity15 director of rugby @entity46			1
‘ people will say when teams are physical against us we ca n’t play but the game ’s about mind - set			0
if belief was coursing through us i think we ’d have taken more of the chances we created but winning in the way we did will make us even stronger mentally			0
’ @entity59 captain @entity58 put in an excellent display as the @entity15 pack dominated at @entity62 the exceptional @entity25 , still on 23 years old , is surely an @entity59 star of the future it would appear after a slow start , which insiders put down largely to their willingness to give their @entity59 contingent a decent lay - off during the summer , the west @entity2 club are stirring			1
in man of the match @entity25 , they have a young lock who will surely grace the international stage soon			2
@entity74 ’ 24 - year - old @entity73 was one of @entity77 ’s uncapped picks last week but the hulking @entity25 — superb in the line out and athletic around the field — can not be far behind			2
quins are close to signing @entity84 lock @entity83 but , on this evidence , and the evidence of much of the past 12 months , @entity25 is a player with a very bright future indeed			0
@entity89 tries to kick in behind the @entity17 defence during the hard - fought @entity35 contest @entity93 celebrates as @entity94 runs in for his try , @entity17 only one of the game it was a superb solo effort from @entity98 , putting @entity17 8 - 6 ahead after just half an hour , but @entity15 hit back ‘ he ’s 23 and he ’s had two or three years at the coalface , ’ said @entity46			1
‘ he ’s a big man who will get used to his body and his best is two or three years down the line			0
he ’s just so big and it sometimes takes time			0
‘ but you can see it coming			0
he ’s a strong player who understands his game is to be physical			0
and he ’s a good lineout forward			0
it ’s nice that young @entity111 players are getting an opportunities			2
’ @entity46 ’s men outscored @entity17 by two tries to one , while @entity115 kicked five from seven			1
@entity94 ’s superb solo try had seen @entity17 take an 8 - 6 lead on the half - hour			1
but @entity25 latched on to a sweeping @entity15 move just before the break to gallop in from 20 metres			1
he continued to impress after the interval , thanks in part to some vastly improved throwing in from hooker @entity123 , as the visitors ’ pack squeezed @entity17 for all they were worth			1
@entity126 thunders into a @entity16 tackle as the visiting pack continued to find the edge over @entity17 @entity115 prepares to kick one of his three penalties as the @entity132 picked up 13 points in the win without captain @entity135 , who suffered a nasty viral infection which kept in hospital for much of last week , @entity17 ’ pack lacked drive and were outmuscled by a @entity15 eight full of outstanding performers , not least @entity59 captain @entity58			1
@entity17 director of rugby @entity141 said : ‘ we were second best in most areas and i thought we looked a flat , tired team today			2
@entity15 were by far the best team			2
we ’ve got no excuses			0
we came second best and i thought the score flattered us			0
that was a reality check for us			0
’ @entity46 was keen to play down concerns over the quad injury which saw prop @entity149 withdraw from the game after initially being named in the starting xv , while @entity141 also bristled at a question about the newly introduced @entity153 after @entity93 and @entity16 both returned to the field having left it looking noticeably groggy			0
@entity141 , who bristled at a question about head injuries , looks dejected as @entity17 lost their second game ‘ from my point of view and anybody ’s point of view at the club we ’d never put any player at risk , ’ said @entity141			1
‘ we ’ll certainly follow any protocol to the letter			0

young second row puts in superb display for @entity15
wasps pick up second losing bonus point in two games
@entity15 pack outmuscled @entity17 in the *absence* of @entity135
