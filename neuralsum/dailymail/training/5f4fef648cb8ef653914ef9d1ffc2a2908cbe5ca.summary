i completely blacked out when it happened			0
i ca n't remember anything			0
' all i know is i was playing out with my friends and the next thing i know i am on the floor crying with loads of people around me			0
' fortunate : the 10 - year - old , circled , suffered only minor injuries when he was hit , but police have warned that the collision could have been fatal			1
above , footage shows @entity5 left sprawled on the street after the collision @entity5 's mother @entity21 , 31 , said if the driver had been going any faster , he would have killed her son			1
the mother - of - three said : ' i just hope the police find who did this because we are the lucky ones really			1
the next person they hit might not be so lucky			2
' ' sleepless nights ' : @entity5 was lucky to walk away with only minor injuries but said that he relives the moment of the crash every time he closes his eyes the dinner lady , who works at @entity35 said she feared the worst when her neighbour 's children rushed to her door to tell her @entity5 had been hit			1

i do n't let @entity5 play out on the streets after 7pm anymore because you just do n't know what kind of people are out there			2
