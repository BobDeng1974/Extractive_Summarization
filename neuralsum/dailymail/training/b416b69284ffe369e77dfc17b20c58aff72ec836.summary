' that was the sort of woman she was , selfless , caring and the sort of woman who always put other people before herself , no matter how ill she was			0

' @entity13 decided that a mastectomy was her only choice and just three months after the birth of her twins she faced painful rounds of chemotherapy as she recovered			0

we did n’t hide it from the girls but we were careful about what we said to them			0
' having to tell them ‘ mummy has cancer again ’ was heartbreaking			0

' @entity13 did n’t want the girls to feel any anger that she had been taken away from them so soon , she just wanted them to know that she loved them dearly and wanted to spend as much time with them as she could			0
' @entity11 is a teenager and at the age where she is angry that her mum had gone but @entity13 did n’t want that for her , and so she encouraged us all to start counselling			2
' @entity11 wrote a poem to read out at @entity13 ’s funeral that showed just how much she would miss her mum , it took a lot of courage for her to do that			2
' life will never be the same without her but i have four incredible girls that i have to live for , i promised @entity13 that i would do that for her			0
' i lost a mummy with a heart of gold , a mummy who ’s smile i will always hold , i ’ll miss the way you tuck me in at night when i was upset you would hug me tight , you never had to speak for me to know you cared , that unspoken bond was just something that we shared , making me laugh was something you were good at too , the smile in your face cheered me up when i was feeling blue , sneaking off to @entity257 ’s when daddy was n’t there , he might laugh now or give me that stare , these were all the funny times , the best when you were here , although this has all changed i will still remember it dear , shopping with you is another memory i will hold close , the fun and laughter we had with this i will always raise a toast , remember that milk shake we had that froze straight through our chests , even though it was so cold it was still the best , when i used to struggle in school , you would know just how to help me through , i will miss that terribly about you , but i know you ’ll be my guardian angel mummy being there when i need you around guiding me through life as i will be getting older now , all these memories and so many more , i will always hold on to , but i know you have n’t left even though it may seem so , i know you ’re in heaven and closer than we all know , no need to worry so much about me mummy and i will try not to worry to because you ’re safe and happy which makes me happy too , i know you ’ll be with me mummy wherever i may go , @entity290 is looking after you now but i ’ll never forget you so .			0
