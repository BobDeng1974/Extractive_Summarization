by @entity0 published : 08:40 est , 17 march 2014 updated : 09:50 est , 17 march 2014 a ‘ miracle baby ’ has defied the odds to reach his second birthday despite being born with just a tiny amount of healthy brain			1
@entity8 discovered three months into her pregnancy that baby @entity10 had a catalogue of health problems including spina bifida , rare chromosome abnormalities and hydrocephalus - fluid on the brain			1
his condition was so serious that doctors warned mrs @entity8 , 42 , and husband @entity19 , 48 , that he would not survive			1
@entity20 ( pictured with his mother , @entity21 ) has amazed doctors by reaching his second birthday despite having a catalogue of serious health problems but despite the odds being stacked against them , the couple repeatedly refused a termination and two years on @entity10 is continuing to astound medical professionals			1
mrs @entity8 , from @entity29 , @entity30 , said : ‘ we wanted to give @entity10 a chance			1
‘ we are trying really hard to make day - to - day life as normal as we possibly can for him - we treat him just like any other child			2
‘ he is potty training now and he knows if he uses the potty then he gets chocolate			2
‘ it is amazing that he understands what it is and what he is supposed to do despite having only two per cent of his brain functioning			1
‘ he can also use a fork , spoon and a cup by himself			2
he knows a lot of different animals and will tell you to put the light on or off or to open the door			2
before he was born @entity10 's parents were advised to abort him because he has spina bifida as well as fluid on the brain and rare chromosomal abnormalities @entity10 's mother says that he has just two per cent of the amount of normal brain tissue he should have			1
image shows a scan of his brain - the dark area is all fluid and the grey area is the only normal brain tissue ‘ he chooses things and makes decisions			1
he never shuts up and he can sing as well			2
‘ it is absolutely amazing			2
to look at him you would n’t know there was anything wrong			2
’ when mrs @entity8 went for her 12 - week scan doctors discovered that her unborn baby had spina bifida , a condition which affects the development of the spinal cord			1
doctors also told the couple that the condition had left a massive hole in @entity10 ’s back which they said they would be unable to stitch up			1
during the pregnancy , the couple were regularly offered a termination but they stood firm , adamant that their son deserved the chance to live			1
@entity20 ( pictured with @entity90 star @entity89 ) was not expected to survive for long after his birth and his parents were warned he would not be resuscitated - so they were amazed to hear him cry @entity10 ( pictured shortly after his birth ) was allowed home when he was 10 days old but he had to return to hospital several times after suffering complications but realising that the odds of survival were extremely low , the family began organising the unborn baby ’s funeral			1
but when @entity10 was born on march 6 in 2012 , he took his first breath and began crying			1
he was paralysed from the chest down - but he was alive			1
doctors changed their mind and carried out a five - hour operation to stitch up @entity10 ’s back			1
mrs @entity8 said : ‘ the first thing we heard when he was born was him taking a breath and then crying , which was unbelievable			1
‘ we had been told that he would n’t be going down to the baby care unit because they were adamant that he would n’t take a breath and said it would be cruel to keep a baby alive on oxygen			0

@entity10 ( pictured with his mother , @entity21 , shortly after his birth ) is paralysed from the chest down @entity10 's mother , @entity21 , has set up a shop to raise money for @entity10			1
she was given a small business sunday award by @entity90 star @entity129 the space left by the brain in @entity10 ’s head is filled by cerebrospinal fluid ( @entity134 ) which is drained regularly by a fitted shunt			1
he passes this fluid out when he goes to the toilet			1
the fluid became infected when @entity10 was seven weeks old and he had the shunt removed			1
two and a half litres of fluid was drained manually using a needle in his head			2
the shunt was then replaced and the shape of @entity10 ’s head is now closely monitored			0
despite having so little healthy brain tissue , @entity10 can say a few words and he is now potty training @entity10 ( pictured shortly after his birth ) is susceptible to fits and to meningitis and his parents know that they have to take one day at a time with him @entity10 requires constant supervision , has to be massaged five times a day as well as undertaking regular sessions of physiotherapy and hydrotherapy			1
as he only has a tiny part of his brain , his parents and sisters @entity159 , 21 , and @entity160 , 17 , are forced to live day to day knowing that it could be the last time they spend with him			1
mrs @entity8 said : ‘ we do n’t know how long he will live but we wo n’t put a time on him			0
we just take every day as it comes			0
‘ we spend a lot of quality time with him and he gets a lot of attention			0
