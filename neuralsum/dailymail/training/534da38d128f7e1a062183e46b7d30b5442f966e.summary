when @entity1 had a suspected stroke due her to huge weight , she knew that she had to take drastic action			1
she immediately joined a slimming club and made serious changes to her lifestyle , but as she began to lose weight and get fitter a new motivation for dropping the pounds came along : a sexy date with a ' boudoir ' photographer			1
@entity1 's friend had encouraged her to take part in a boudoir shoot , and @entity1 knew that the only way she would dare to bare in her underwear was to carry on losing weight			1
it spurred her on to lose 7st 9lb , going from 18 stone 7 to a much slimmer 10 stone 10 , and drop six dress sizes in the process			1
' a friend had encouraged me to have the photoshoot done			1
i would never have dreamed of doing anything like that before			2
' but losing the weight really boosted my confidence and it definitely helped me carrying on losing the pounds			1
' @entity1 started piling on the weight when she was in her 30 's , and she 'd struggled with her weight on and off during her teenage years			1
' when i was very little , i was a podgy child , ' she said			2
' then i slimmed down a bit , but put weight back on in my early teens			1
by my late teens i 'd slimmed down to a size 12 , and when i was 25 i was actually a size 10			1
but then i put on some weight in my 30 's			2
the mother - of - one , who was a size 22 at her largest , was shocked into changing her lifestyle after suffering a suspected stroke ' by the time i married my husband in 2005 i was a size 16 , and then a year later , when i gave birth to our son @entity34 in 2006 my weight had crept up to about 17 stone			1
' in the following few years i was n't happy with my size , but i would comfort eat , and the weight piled on even more			1
' @entity1 would n't eat any breakfast , then she would tuck into pasties for a mid morning snack			1
she would have sandwiches and crisps for lunch , and then often she would have a takeaway for dinner			2
' i work as a carpenter making children 's play equipment , and my colleague would nip out mid morning and get pasties for us to snack on , and that was before i would eat any lunch			2
' i would snack on chocolate during the day , especially my favourite yorkie bars			2
when i ate chocolate bars at night , i could n't eat just a few pieces , i would wolf down the whole bar			2
and i would have takeaways several times during the week and at weekends too			0
i especially loved @entity92 and kebabs too			0
' @entity1 started losing weight when she swapped takeaways for salads and homemade dinners , but it was booking the sexy shoot that gave her the final motivation she needed to slim down but @entity1 's weight proved to be a problem when she was working on a child 's play cottage in a garden near @entity33			1
she said : ' i was working with my colleague @entity106 in the garden			0
i was inside the children 's play cottage hammering in some nails , and he was outside			0
suddenly i had tunnel vision and everything went dark			0
i had a splitting pain in the the side of my face above my eye and i felt really sick			0
' it was terrifying , i had no idea what was happening to me and i could n't get my words out properly either			0
i wanted to shout out to @entity106 to come and help me , but i could n't even remember his name			0
luckily he heard me banging about in the cottage and came to see what was wrong			0
' he helped me outside and got me to sit down , but i still felt really unwell			0
' when @entity1 started to feel better , she went down to the hospital where she was tested in the stroke unit as doctors thought she may have suffered a minor stroke			1
today , weighing 10 st 10 lb , @entity1 says doing the shoot was the best thing to happen to her she said : ' i was eventually given the all clear and i had n't actually had a stroke			1
but it gave me such a fright			0
the doctors told me that my weight had probably caused it , so it was really worrying			2
it had been such a terrifying experience that i knew that i had to something about it			0
' i felt that it was my fault , that i 'd felt so unwell and it was only me who could do something about it			0
' so in january 2013 , @entity1 , who is now single , joined her local @entity144			1
she swapped takeaways and chocolate bars for healthy breakfasts , salad lunches and homemade spaghetti bolognaise or cottage pie for dinner			0
' it was a great diet as i could eat as much as i liked , but it was healthy food and not all the sugar and salt in takeaways			0
' the weight started to fall off @entity1 , and when she had lost several stone , she was chatting with a friend , who made a suggestion			1
' my friend 's daughter had just done a modelling photoshoot , ' she said			2
' and my friend said i should do one too , to celebrate having lost all the weight			1
she encourage me to do a shoot in my lingerie to really boost my confidence			1
' i 'd never even imagined doing such a photoshoot before , and it was something that was completely out of my comfort zone			0
but i gave it some thought and decided that it would give me something to work towards			2
' so i booked the shoot , and carried on losing the weight and managed to hit my target weight of ten stone ten in march			1
the photoshoot was booked for june			0
' i was nervous when i arrived at the @entity183 studio but the photographer really put me at ease , and so did the make - up artist			0
' when i was overweight i did n't even like dressing up to go out , so the thought of stripping down to my underwear and being photographed was something i would have never thought i would ever contemplate			1
' but there i was stretched out in all my lingerie , and as the shoot went on , i felt more relaxed and less nervous			1
i was proud of my body after losing all the weight , but i still had loose skin and stretch marks too			2
but i was thrilled with the photos afterwards			0
i just looked at them and did n't even believe it was me at first ! i never imagined i could ever look like that			0
' when i showed the photos to family and friends they were amazed too			0
i 've lost a total of 7 stone 9 , going from 18 stone 7 to 10 stone 10			2
and i 've dropped from a size 22 to a 10/12			1
i still ca n't believe it when i catch sight of my reflection in shop windows as i walk past - i have to do a double take as i do n't realise its me			0
' i feel much healthier too , and i have n't had another funny turn like i had that time in the garden			0
i 've got much more energy for my job and playing with @entity34 too			0
if anyone had told me i would lose nearly eight stone and pose for a sexy photoshoot i would n't have believed them			1
but it 's been the best thing to have happened to me			0
