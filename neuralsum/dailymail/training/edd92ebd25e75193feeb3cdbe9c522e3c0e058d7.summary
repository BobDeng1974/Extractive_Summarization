by @entity0 last updated at 5:15 pm on 1st february 2012 an @entity2 comedian appearing on @entity3 found himself lost in translation today after using the word ' w * * * * r ' while discussing a stateside remake of @entity7			1
presenters @entity8 and @entity10 had asked funnyman @entity11 how he would pronounce one of @entity15 's favourite sayings ' lovely jubbly ' in an @entity2 accent			1
@entity11 replied : ' you would n't , because it 's like me saying w * * * * r '			1
fellow guest @entity24 ( right ) looks on with bemusement moments earlier , presenters @entity8 and @entity10 ( right ) had asked @entity11 how he would pronounce one of @entity15 's favourite sayings ' lovely jubbly ' in an @entity2 accent @entity11 replied : ' you would n't , because it 's like me saying w * * * * r ' while the w - word is offensive in the @entity37 , its derogatory connotation is generally unknown in the @entity38			1
@entity2 dictionary @entity39 defines ' w * * * * r ' as ' chiefly @entity37 , usually vulgar '			1
to @entity2 ears , the word just means ' a stupid person '			1
such is the mild nature of the swear - word in the @entity2 that it even appeared in a 1998 episode of @entity48 ( ' @entity49 ' ) , where it is uttered by @entity51 bass player @entity50 and mr @entity52			1
in 2008 , the episode aired twice before the watershed on @entity55 uncensored and received 31 complaints			2
amid shrieks of astonishment , the presenters immediately apologised to viewers			0
mr @entity11 , clearly taken aback , also said sorry - unaware of the offence he had caused			1
fellow guest , comedian @entity24 , could not help laughing and struggled to compose himself			0
mr @entity11 , who is described on @entity63 as ' looking like the underfed brother of @entity65 ' , is well known for his wry observations of @entity37 life			1
he has lived and worked in the @entity37 for many years and has often performed at the @entity68			0
but he had overlooked one of the most infamous swear words in the country			0
a @entity3 spokesman said : ' unfortunately , a guest used a swearword live on - air this morning			0
' both @entity10 and @entity8 apologised immediately and again at the end of the interview			0
we are sorry for any offence caused			0
' meanwhile , @entity81 users have been congratulating mr @entity11 by saying he ' just made my morning '			1
@entity83 tweeted : ' @entity11 saying ' w * * * * r ' on bbc breakfast did a better job of waking me up than my coffee haha			1
' @entity89 said : ' funny to see comedian @entity11 slip up on bbc breakfast and use the word			1
' and @entity93 said : ' if you just heard @entity2 comedian @entity11 saying ' @entity96 ' on @entity3 breakfast news just made my morning ... ... ... ... ...			1
! ! ! ! ! ! ' look out , @entity2 , the @entity99 are coming @entity15 rarely made it past @entity101 in his yellow @entity102			1
but the @entity99 could finally be taking their brand of market trading global , with a deal that is set to conquer @entity2			2
senior @entity2 tv executives have commissioned a pilot episode of the much - loved @entity37 sitcom , which starred @entity109 and @entity110			2
@entity15 , left , @entity111 , centre , and @entity113 , right , could feature in a @entity2 version of @entity7 being planned by tv executives the show could see @entity2 versions of @entity15 , @entity111 and @entity117 using expressions such as ' tool ' instead of plonker and ' awesome ' instead of lovely jubbly			1
and the loveable rogues are more likely to live in an apartment than a block of high - rise council flats			0
writers @entity126 and @entity128 , the team behind hit shows @entity131 and scrubs are understood to be working on a pilot			0
characters : @entity135 , left , from the @entity2 version of @entity137 could play @entity15 while @entity138 could portray @entity111 the show will centre on the the ' misadventures of two streetwise brothers and their ageing grandfather as they concoct outrageous , morally questionable get - rich - quick schemes in a bid to become millionaires ' , according to the @entity146			2
the sitcom was an enormous success in @entity37 , where it was broadcast on @entity150 between 1981 and 1991			0
highly - anticipated @entity152 specials were also shown until 2003 , when @entity15 finally made his millions by selling an antique watch			0
plonker - tool lovely jubbly - awesome dipstick - schmuck @entity155 - dope geezer - dude bird - babe perfect - ace terrific - neat easy money - pure gravy pound - buck @entity161 - joint @entity162 - all good @entity163 - primo one iconic scene showed @entity15 and @entity111 dress up as @entity165 , before turning up at a wake they thought was a fancy dress party			1
but the unique brand of @entity37 humour may not prove as popular with a @entity2 audience familiar with a different style of comedy			2
previous attempts to repackage popular shows such as @entity176 and are you being served for a @entity2 audience failed			2
even the office written by @entity180 initially received a lukewarm reaction from baffled audiences before it became a success			0
one of the few other shows to have become a success in the @entity2 was @entity186 , which was remade as @entity188 and ran between 1972 and 1977			2
@entity135 , who played @entity180 ' character in @entity137 , has said it would be a ' dream role ' to star in a @entity2 version of @entity7			2
' the @entity37 do sitcoms better than anybody else in the world			0
i think with the right scriptwriters and cast we could do @entity7 justice			0
if anybody wants to help me do a remake i 'd love it , ' said @entity135			2
there have also been suggestions that @entity138 , who played @entity204 in @entity205 , could star as @entity111			0
while @entity206 might play @entity117			0
this most likely setting for the show would be among the hustle and bustle of @entity211 - a city that is no stranger to wheelers and dealers such as @entity15 looking to make a living .			0

@entity11 had been asked to say ' lovely jubbly ' in an @entity2 accent
