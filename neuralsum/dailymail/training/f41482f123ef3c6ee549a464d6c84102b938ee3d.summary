in the car park lurked their target , cornered at last after a four - mile chase			0
the target ’s identity ? one rather unfortunate @entity13 blue cow , who had wandered out of her field earlier in the day			0
the escaped @entity16 was ' dispatched ' after it became aggressive near a primary school police marksmen were seen on top of a van near to the scene - they missed their target on the first shot but killed the cow on the second but her great escape turned into a full - blown armed siege , after @entity27 sent four marksmen , one sergeant , five unarmed officers and two @entity30 , travelling in five patrol cars and a police van , to track her down			1
back at base , a superintendent , a tactical adviser and three support staff oversaw the operation , which ended with the cow being killed			1
witnesses claim the first two shots missed , although officers insist they simply failed to bring the animal down			0
police were yesterday accused of being ‘ trigger happy ’ for their heavy - handed approach , with more than 2,000 people joining a @entity47 group set up in memory of the runaway cow			1
the @entity16 , generally a docile breed , was first spotted just before 3pm on monday , roaming in residential roads less than a mile from the centre of @entity53			1
children and school staff nearby were evacuated while the cow was dealt with police were called after members of the public said she had started to charge at them			1
a patrol car chased the animal for four miles and she became increasingly distressed , eventually jumping a fence into the car park of @entity64 at around 5pm			0
its 170 pupils had been evacuated earlier and moved to a safer area before leaving for the day , and only the head teacher and a few staff remained			0
police set up a 20 - metre exclusion zone and two of the marksmen were instructed to kill			1
the first two shots , fired from a distance , failed to bring the animal down			0
the van was driven closer and the marksmen shot twice more , eventually killing the cow			1
while some locals said they were pleased police had dealt with the animal before she harmed anyone , others said they were over-zealous			0
one , @entity85 , said : ‘ i ca n’t believe they felt they needed to take a sniper shot at a cow			2
it ’s not like it was a ravenous bear stalking @entity53			0
’ @entity27 said it had spoken to the @entity92 and the owner , who gave his permission for the cow to be shot			2
superintendent @entity96 said it was ‘ regrettable ’ the cow had been killed			2
‘ we tried everything we could to capture the animal but it became increasingly distressed , aggressive and unpredictable			2
‘ our first priority at all times was for public safety .			0
