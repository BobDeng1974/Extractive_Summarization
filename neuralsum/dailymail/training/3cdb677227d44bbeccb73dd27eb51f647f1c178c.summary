@entity1 head to @entity2 on tuesday for what they hope will be a victorious @entity6 campaign , and quick bowler @entity7 says they have to forget about former captain @entity9			1
the test skipper lost his one - day job last month after five straight losses , with @entity13 stepping up to lead the team down under			0
@entity7 admits to being ' gutted ' about what has happened to @entity9 , but says there can be no scope for looking back as @entity1 look to finalise their preparations ahead of the tournament which starts on february 14			1
@entity7 is fully focused on @entity1 doing well at the @entity6 next month ' @entity9 is one of my closest friends in cricket and i know he was absolutely shattered to be sacked as @entity1 one - day captain , ' @entity7 told the @entity26 ' to change the captain so close to the @entity6 was a big call but the selectors clearly felt @entity31 's form with the bat had been too poor for too long			1
' whether it was the correct decision remains to be seen			0
if we win the tournament then , obviously , the decision will have been vindicated			0
@entity9 was sacked as @entity1 captain after a run of poor form with the bat @entity13 will captain @entity1 as they go in search of @entity6 glory in @entity2 ' i 'm gutted for my mate			1
however , as brutal or heartless as it may sound , i ca n't go to @entity2 worrying about how @entity31 is feeling or wishing he was with us			0
' my only consideration is to focus on helping the team in the tri-series with @entity2 and @entity50 and then the @entity6 that follows			1
' @entity31 has a couple of months now to try and get over the disappointment			0
i 'm sure it will be hard watching the guys playing in the @entity6 on tv but he must look forward to the test matches in 2015			0
' @entity7 ( right ) says he is gutted for his close friend @entity9 but says he can not think about that at the moment @entity1 start their schedule with a warm - up clash against an @entity63 on january 12 , before meeting a prime minister 's xi two days later			2
that side was named by prime minster @entity67 on sunday , with former @entity2 batsman @entity68 named as captain			2
@entity70 - an outside fancy for the @entity6 is named - as are @entity2 internationals @entity73 and @entity74 .			2

@entity9 was sacked as captain after a run of poor form with the bat
