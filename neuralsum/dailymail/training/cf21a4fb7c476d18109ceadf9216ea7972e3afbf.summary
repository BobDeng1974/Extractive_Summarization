thief : building society cashier @entity1 , 23 , has been jailed after stealing from elderly savers a crooked cashier who stole £ 40,000 from pensioners ' savings has been jailed after she was exposed by two victims in their 90s			1
@entity1 hoped her victims would think they had ' lost their marbles ' and spent the money - which is what two of them , aged 94 and 96 , said they were told when they alerted building society staff			1
but the elderly pair refused to back down , and @entity1 was eventually brought to justice with her cocaine and drink habit exposed			1
the 23 - year - old stole £ 40,000 from the accounts of five @entity21 customers between may and november 2013 , @entity17 heard			1
she looked for the savings of people who rarely withdrew money , suggesting they had forgotten about them			0
that was until sharp - eyed @entity28 , 94 , spotted £ 20,000 missing from her account			1
she knew she had not spent the money because it was set aside for her funeral			1
although the retired barmaid used a wheelchair , she insisted on being taken to a branch near her @entity17 home to question the withdrawal			2
ms @entity28 has since died but her nephew @entity37 , 61 , said the building society ' kept insisting ' his aunt had withdrawn the money			2
' this woman did a lot of harm and will be inside for six months but if you asked people if they would do six months in prison for £ 40,000 , they would queue up , ' he added			2
' it 'll be like going into a holiday camp			0
' he said he did not blame his aunt 's death on @entity1 ' thefts but said ' it did n't help '			2
he added : ' it was always on her mind and she went into hospital three times			0
' @entity59 , a 96 - year - old widower , also saw £ 2,200 was missing when he received an annual statement in march 2014 - but said staff denied responsibility to him too			1
' they claimed i had lost my marbles and that i 'd spent it , ' he said			1
' i could not understand how this had happened because i had my paying - in books at home			2
' i did n't even know you could withdraw money from a building society without the books			0
' i was not very happy at all when they kept saying i had lost my marbles and spent it			1
helpless : two victims said staff at the building society insisted they spent the cash by mistake ( file photo ) ' they kept saying to my daughter that she needed to jog my memory			1
' but they were just messing about and keeping it hush - hush until they finally came out and said where it had gone			0
' mr @entity59 's daughter , @entity90 , 60 , a nurse , said : ' the building society were basically saying he was gaga and did n't know he had the money			2
' but this was the work of a despicable young woman in a position of trust , taking advantage of the elderly and vulnerable			0
' @entity1 , pictured in her mugshot , was described as a ' despicable young woman in a position of trust ' @entity1 , of @entity103 , @entity21 was jailed for 12 months yesterday for taking a total of £ 40,000 from customers ' accounts			1
she will spend half the sentence in prison			0
the court heard she had no assets to her name but claimed to have given £ 3,000 to her boyfriend			0
police asked him for a statement on this but he failed to make one			0
@entity1 also claimed to have handed more than £ 6,000 to a village pub. this has now closed and the former landlady said it was a £ 1,000 loan which had been repaid			1
other enquiries had been made into all @entity1 ' cash claims but judge @entity124 said : ' that still remains a mystery			1
' the court heard she had spent thousands of pounds of the money ' on drink and drugs '			0
@entity133 , in mitigation , said @entity1 was in the grip of cocaine and alcohol at the time but was now clear of both drugs			2
he added : ' she realises the hurt and distress she has caused as a result of her offending			0
' the @entity21 was bought out last year and is now part of @entity144			1
a spokesman said : ' employee fraud is extremely rare , but where it does happen , we take it very seriously , treating victims fairly and ensuring that those affected are not financially disadvantaged			0
' in this particular case , we took action as soon as we were alerted to the situation			0
' the suggestion that our branch staff were not taking customer concerns seriously is not a behaviour we recognise amongst our employees who pride themselves on excellent customer service			0
' we have a policy in place for the management of vulnerable customers who have the potential to become victims of financial crime and this is regularly communicated to our employees			0
