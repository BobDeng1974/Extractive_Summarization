one of the most legendary horror homes to feature in the movies : the house with the scariest basement in @entity4 , from @entity5 , appears to now be in a dreamlike state			1
the house that @entity8 haunted is actually on @entity9 in @entity10			1
it was a delightful suburban cottage when it appeared in the film , but it fell into neglect by the previous family who owned it who left the house to fall apart			1
it recent years it has undergone an extensive renovation turning it into something more akin to a dream home than haunted house			1
initially , the home bore a greater resemblance to the decrepit and decaying version in @entity8 's dream world than the original sunny suburban home that shows up in the early films			1
' it was horrible , ' @entity34 said			0
' it was the only house on the street that looked beaten up ...			2
the pool looked like it had n't been touched in 10 years - it was black			2
' paint was chipping and cracks were showing all over the home 's exterior , and the concrete patio in the backyard was breaking apart			2
asking price : the house sold for the full asking price of $ 2.1 million only seven years after the deteriorating house sold for $ 1.15 million all new : for the renovation , designers fused modern and traditional elements replacing every piece of wood and redoing the floor plan @entity68 dreams : the new owners will have their choice of three huge bedrooms each with its own private bath modern : the newly redone house is filled with state - of - the - art furnishing and appliances ' it had the weirdest vibe , ' @entity34 said			1
' you could feel the weird energy			0
there was a really oppressive odor			0
' so she burned some sage to get ready of the bad energy , and then completely dismantled the property			0
first , she burned sage to clear the energy in the house , she said			2
then , she took apart 90 percent of the entire home - walls , ceilings , the roof - and replaced them			1
inside , it 's now a striking piece of traditional / modernist fusion that neither @entity8 nor @entity96 would recognize , as shown in a 2012 listing for the property			0
it sold in 2013 for $ 2.1 million - a few hundred thousand dollars more than it cost director @entity101 to make the original ' nightmare ' movie			1
' i replaced every piece of wood and reconfigured the floor plan , ' recalled @entity34			0
' i ripped off half the house			2
' only a portion of the exterior shell of the house remained intact while she gut - renovated every room			1
shower scene : the house features 3.25 bathrooms without even counting the one in the guest house the work was so extensive that it took nearly a year to complete before she could officially move in			1
the front exterior of the house still looks mostly the same as it did in ' @entity5 , ' with a striking red door			2
cult followers of the classic horror film still recognize it today			0
' people stop and take pictures , and there 's a tour bus that goes by three times a day , ' @entity34 said			0
' sometimes people come to the door and say stupid things like , ' do you know what house this is ? ' ' she admits , the home 's fictional history of horror still has a very real effect on her			1
although there was no nightmare villain hanging out in the property , it still gave @entity34 the creeps			0
' i used to be afraid to go in the basement , ' she said			0
get cooking : this stocked kitchen is any chef 's dream hardwood : the home 's gorgeous hardwood floors run all over the new floorplan chef 's kitchen : there 'll be no need to have nightmares about dinner with this fully - renovated kitchen filled with stainless steel appliances long visit : invite friends to stay in comfort at the property 's beautiful one bedroom guest house the renovation features completely modern furnishings , stainless steel kitchen appliances , and hardwood floors throughout			1
the backyard is just as plush as the indoors , with a gorgeous garden and pool			0
basement chills : horror fans can take comfort in the fact that from the outside , the home looks almost exactly the same as it did in the films			0
but the inside is a totally different story			0

the house is in @entity10 - but only the exteriors were used in the film
it was in complete *disrepair* when it was purchased in 2008
it now looks to be *immaculate* after the entire home underwent a complete renovation and sold for $ 2.1 million
