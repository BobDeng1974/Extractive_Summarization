by @entity0 and @entity1 family feuds can drive people to take drastic action â€“ however most do n't go to the extreme lengths of building a house just to spite a sibling			1
this is @entity9 's skinniest house that was built by an enraged brother after he returned from war to find the land he 'd inherited had been mostly taken by his brother			1
the slender house measures just 10.4ft at its widest point and tapers to a mere 9.25ft at its narrowest			1
inside the home the narrowest interior point is just 6ft 2 inches and the ceilings are just 6 ft , 4 inches high			1
the skinny house in @entity9 , @entity23 , was built by an enraged brother after he returned from war to find the land he 'd inherited had been mostly taken by his brother the wooden house was erected with the main purpose of blocking out sunlight and spoiling his brother 's view of the nearby river it has the uncontested distinction of being the narrowest house in @entity9 , @entity23 , sitting at 44 @entity37 in the @entity39 area of the city			1
however whilst it now may attract tourists and can even be rented out , the story behind the house has a tumultuous beginning			1
as the story goes , two brothers who each inherited land from their deceased father got into a dispute shortly after the @entity49			0
whilst the second brother was away serving in the military , the first brother built a large home on the land , leaving the soldier a shred of the property			1
the back of the skinny house in @entity9 , @entity23 , ( left ) and ( right ) a door entrance , which rather unusually , is not found on the front of the property the number of the skinny house in @entity9 , @entity23 the first brother thought there was no room for his serving brother to build land on			1
but when he returned , he wanted to spite his brother for what he 'd done			0
so the wooden house was erected with the main purpose of blocking out sunlight and spoiling his brother 's view of the nearby river			1
the current owners once described to the @entity75 newspaper what it 's like to hold a party there			0
legend has it that in 1874 , two brothers got into a dispute after each had previously inherited land from their deceased father @entity84 said : ' we had a party of 10 one @entity87 , and when one person has to go to the bathroom , everyone has to move			0
' ms @entity84 , 44 , also explained how there are only five doors in the house and the bathroom and the living room are one of the few rooms actually separated by a door			2
each floor is a different room			0
the young daughter 's bedroom shares the third floor with a closet			0
the second floor is the living room and bathroom			0
the top floor is the couple 's master bedroom and home office			2
' instead of doors we have floors between each space and for guests we have to put a mattress down on the closet floor if they want to sleep			0
' with only 964 square feet to work with , any person staying the skinny house has to be creative with their space			2
the family is also used to being a tourist attraction , and has found people sitting in their backyard taking photos before			0
at its 6 ' 2 " narrowest , a tall person can touch the opposing walls with outstretched arms			2
@entity132 , @entity23 , is the home to potentially the first example of a spite house in the @entity135 - appropriately enough now known as @entity136			1
like the above example in @entity9 , it was again a case of two brothers feuding over land			1
after one steamed ahead and built his wooden house , with views over the nearby @entity145 , in 1716 his brother @entity146 constructed a home just 10ft wide as revenge			1
dispute : two brothers were also behind the spite house in @entity132 , @entity23 , pictured above an even smaller house was constructed in @entity153 , @entity154 , in 1830			2
the bright blue building measures just 7ft wide , and is inhabited to this day			2
before it came into being , the narrow space it now occupies was an alleyway , which would often be crammed with horse - and - cart traffic and unwanted loiterers			0
so owner @entity161 built the home , which extends 25ft back , to win himself some peace and quiet			2
roadblock : this house in @entity153 , @entity154 , ( centre , blue ) was built in 1830 to stop traffic using an alleway			0
it is just 7ft wide meanwhile in @entity171 , @entity172 , a @entity170 landowner managed to change the whole shape of his town with an inconsiderately - placed home			0
despite the city 's intention to lay out its streets in a perfect grid , the property developer insisted on setting out his home on a triangular piece of land , which planners had to build around			1
defiant : this house was built on a triangular plot of land , ruining plans to arrange @entity171 , @entity172 into blocks bone of contention : the roads are arranged into neat right angles until it hits the offending triangular point - forcing the road around one spite house in @entity196 came into being because of a land war with a church			1
in @entity202 , @entity196 , when reverend @entity201 died , his family were keen to memorialise him with a monument in the churchyard			0
but @entity206 authorities refused permission and instead suggesting the family donate their own land to the church and build the tower			0
incensed , the family instead built a house of their own on the land with a 40ft column sticking out of it , which was completed in 1904 .			0

the slender house in @entity9 measures just 10.4ft at its widest point
inside the home in the north of the city the narrowest point is just *6.2ft*
