by @entity0 published : 04:32 est , 25 november 2013 @entity2 : 08:30 est , 25 november 2013 for months , all eyes in the sky have pointed at the comet that 's zooming toward a blisteringly close encounter with the sun. and now @entity8 has released a high resolution image of the streaking comet that look like a swimming tadpole			1
it was captured by the h - 1 camera on board @entity8 's @entity14 on november 21			1
scroll down to watch the video appearance : @entity17 entered the view of @entity8 's @entity14 on nov. 21 , 2013 , where it can be seen with @entity21 , @entity22 and comet @entity24 the comet @entity17 shows up clearly , appearing to still be intact , reported @entity8			1
officially labeled as @entity26 / 2012 @entity27 , @entity17 can be seen in these images along with @entity21 , @entity22 and @entity29			1
the tails streaking out from behind both comets can be seen moving along with the steady stream of particles – called the solar wind – that flows out from the sun. the moment of truth comes thursday when the sun - grazing @entity17 , now thought to be less than a mile ( 1.6 kilometers ) wide , will either fry and shatter , victim of the sun 's incredible power , or endure and quite possibly put on one fabulous celestial show			1
streaking : @entity17 ( left ) appeared in the higher - resolution hi - 1 camera on @entity8 's @entity14 - a spacecraft			1
@entity48 ' clouds ' coming from the right are more dense areas in the solar wind , causing ripples in @entity24 's tail solar wind : the tails streaking out from behind both comets can be seen moving along with the steady stream of particles ¿ called the solar wind ¿ that flows out from the sun should it survive , @entity17 , pronounced @entity63 ' - sahn , would be visible with the naked eye through december , at least from the @entity65			1
@entity67 at times in november with ordinary binoculars and occasionally even just the naked eye , it already has dazzled observers and is considered the most scrutinized comet ever by @entity8			1
but the best is , potentially , yet to come			0
detected just over a year ago , the comet is passing through the inner solar system for the first time			1
still fresh , this comet is thought to bear the pristine matter of the beginning of our solar system			1
it 's believed to be straight from the @entity82 cloud on the fringes of the solar system , home to countless icy bodies , most notably the frozen balls of dust and gas in orbit around the sun known as comets			1
for whatever reason , @entity17 was propelled out of this cloud and drawn toward the heart of the solar system by the sun 's intense gravitational pull			1
the closer the comet gets to the sun , the faster it gets			2
in january , it was clocked at 40,000 mph ( 64,000 kph )			0
a composite image from the @entity104 's @entity103 telescope in @entity105 shows @entity17 streaking toward the sun on nov. 15			1
the image combines four different 30 - second exposures of the moving comet in different wavelengths by last thursday , with just a week to go , it had accelerated to 150,000 mph ( 240,000 kph )			1
on thursday , the comet will zip within 730,000 miles ( 1,175,000 kilometers ) of the sun , less than the actual solar diameter			2
in other words , another sun would n't fit in the missed distance			0
by the time @entity17 slingshots around the sun , it will be moving at a mind - boggling 828,000 mph ( 1,332,000 kph )			2
whether it survives or is torn apart , earthlings have nothing to fear			0
the place to see the ‘ comet of the century ’ is in a clear dark sky where the horizon is unobstructed , such as in the countryside			2
it can be seen with the naked eye , but binoculars will highlight details such as its tail , streamers and bumps in the surface			0
the comet is currently close enough to the sun that , tomorrow , it will close to sunrise before its head appears on the horizon			2
by the end of the november , it should be seen before dawn in the eastern sky			0
on 28th of november , @entity17 will pass within 1.2 million miles of the sun ’s surface before skirting around to where the comet will venture no closer to us than about 40 million miles ( 64 million kilometers ) , less than half the distance between @entity21 and the sun. that closest approach to @entity21 will occur dec. 26			2
then it will head away in the opposite direction forever , given its anticipated trajectory once it flies by the sun. @entity17 is named after the @entity160 , used by a pair of @entity163 astronomers to detect the comet in september 2012			2
but it officially is known as @entity17 , a designation indicating when it was discovered			0
take heart : the ' c ' means it is not expected here again			0
@entity8 wasted no time jumping on @entity17			1
the space agency 's @entity170 spacecraft observed @entity17 back in january from a distance of about 500 million miles ( 800 million kilometers )			2
since then , the observations have stacked up			0
among @entity8 's space telescopes taking a look : @entity176 , @entity177 , @entity178 , @entity179 , @entity180 or @entity180 , @entity181 , @entity22 - orbiting messenger , and the stereo twin spacecraft			1
' every spacecraft that has a camera , we 're turning on it , ' said @entity188 , @entity8 's science mission director			1
the comet , top right , has so far been photographed through telescopes and long exposures but is expected to be visible to the naked eye throughout december and january			2
it could be the brightest for 100 years the newly launched @entity197 spacecraft en route to @entity199 will gaze at @entity17 the second week of december , once its ultraviolet instrument is up and running			0
' that 's well after closest approach to the sun , ' the @entity203 's @entity202 , who 's in charge of the instrument , said in an email			2
so it 's not known ' whether we 'll see a comet , comet bits or the last wisps of comet vapor			1
' whatever happens , it 's bound to be interesting			2
the quip from my colleagues is , ` @entity220 are like cats : they have tails and do whatever they want			0
'' besides @entity17 , @entity8 is spying on @entity226 , another @entity82 cloud comet discovered in january by the @entity229 observatory of the same name			1
@entity231 will pass within tens of thousands of miles of @entity199 next october , so close that scientists believe the coma of the comet - its thin but expansive atmosphere - will envelop the red planet			1
@entity238 : @entity17 could prove brighter than @entity239 , pictured , which lit up the skies in 1997 ' it will be blanketed in water and dust and meteorites			0
it moves like 50 kilometers per second , blazing through the environment , ' said @entity245 , director of @entity8 's planetary science division			1
that 's more than 110,000 mph , ( 177,000 kph ) so the comet will be gone from @entity199 ' pretty quick			1
' siding spring - type events have happened before , @entity245 noted			2
' we 're just lucky in our lifetime ' to have the right spacecraft in the right place to observe the spectacle			0
the same applies to @entity17			0
add small sounding rockets to the list of paparazzi chasing the comet ; @entity8 fired up one from @entity260 on wednesday with an ultraviolet telescope that reached 172 miles ( 277 kilometers ) high before descending by parachute			1
consider all the ground observatories peering at the comet , as well as countless amateur astronomers and astrophotographers , and @entity17 has become the belle of the cosmic ball			0
' @entity220 evolve from the time they start brightening until they go all the way around the sun , and go back out , ' @entity245 said			0
' by having and leveraging these assets , it really gives us that view - that unique view - that we could n't get otherwise			0
' some sky gazers speculated early on that @entity17 might become the comet of the century because of its brightness , although expectations have dimmed over the past year			0
scientists expect to know @entity17 's fate fairly quickly			0
at least three spacecraft will be aiming that way in real time			0
if @entity17 survives , ' it 's going to fly right over the @entity65 , ' @entity245 said with clear excitement in his voice			0
it should be visible with the naked eye for 30 days			0
' so it 's really a holiday comet			1
you ought to be able to see it well past @entity291 , ' @entity245 said			0
' but it 's got to survive it , that 's the only thing about that			0
