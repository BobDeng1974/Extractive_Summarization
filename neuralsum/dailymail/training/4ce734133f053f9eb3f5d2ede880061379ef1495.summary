mp @entity0 , who is set to appear on this week 's @entity1 , which will come from @entity3 , north @entity4 , home to a large @entity7 community @entity9 's @entity7 community has criticised the @entity11 ’s decision to invite @entity0 on to this week ’s @entity1			1
the programme will come from @entity3 , @entity4 , which has the largest jewish community of any parliamentary constituency			1
last year mp mr @entity0 was interviewed by police on suspicion of inciting religious hatred after he declared his @entity19 constituency was an ‘ @entity21 - free ’ zone			1
he previously refused to debate with a student at @entity23 because he was @entity21			1
@entity24 , the @entity24 mp for @entity3 and @entity25 , said the invitation was ‘ deliberately provocative ’			1
he added : ‘ the @entity11 ca n’t have done it by accident			2
‘ given what ’s going on in the world it is a slap in the face for the local community			0
’ mr @entity24 and the @entity36 , which brings together major @entity7 organisations , have written to the @entity11 challenging the decision , and asking whether it is a ‘ responsible move ’			1
the @entity40 also attacked the decision to invite mr @entity0 – but said they were not calling on the @entity11 to retract the invitation			1
@entity43 , chief executive of the @entity40 , said : ‘ the @entity11 certainly has questions to answer for this inflammatory and cynical decision			0
‘ however , while some may feel it is expedient to shy away from difficult debates with hostile individuals , we look forward to the people of @entity3 and @entity25 having the opportunity to call @entity0 to account for his scandalous record of provocation and division			2
’ the @entity55 , a charity which monitors anti-semitism and organises security for schools and synagogues said : ‘ we ’re concerned that having it in @entity3 at this time has the potential to inflame community tensions in the areas between communities who normally get on very well			2
we would not want this to spoil that			0
‘ if the @entity11 did n’t understand the strength of feeling in the community about @entity0 , i think they understand it now			1
’ mr @entity0 was thrown out of the @entity74 in 2003 but made a comeback with the @entity76 in 2005 in @entity77			1
he returned to @entity78 in march 2012 after winning the seat of @entity80 in a by - election			0
mr @entity0 giving a speech to @entity83 in @entity19 last year , where he declared @entity19 as an ' @entity21 - free zone ' he was interviewed by @entity85 last august after saying at an event , which was filmed : ‘ we have declared @entity19 an @entity21 - free zone			1
we do n’t want any @entity21 goods ; we do n’t want any @entity21 services ; we do n’t want any @entity21 academics coming to the university or the college			0
‘ we do n’t even want any @entity21 tourists to come to @entity19 even if any of them had thought of doing so			0
we reject this illegal , barbarous , savage state that calls itself @entity21 - and you have to do the same			1
’ in february 2013 , he shocked an audience at @entity98 college , @entity23 by storming out on hearing his opponent was @entity21			2
to cries of ‘ racism ’ , he picked up his coat and stormed out			0
he later wrote on his @entity104 page : ‘ i refused this evening … to debate with a supporter of the apartheid state of @entity21			2
the reason is simple : no recognition , no normalisation			0
just boycott , divestment and sanctions until the apartheid state is defeated			0
’ mr @entity0 has met @entity114 and worked for the @entity116 propaganda channel @entity117			2
in 2009 , @entity118 , which runs the @entity119 and has been designated a terrorist organisation by the @entity121 and @entity122 , gave mr @entity0 a @entity124 passport			2
he gave them £ 25,000			0
this week 's edition of @entity1 , fronted by @entity127 , pictured , comes from @entity128 , home to a large @entity7 community in november 2012 , during an anti-israeli demonstration in his @entity19 constituency , he told those present : ‘ we do not hate @entity7			1
we hate @entity133 , we hate @entity21 , we hate murder and injustice			0
’ a @entity11 spokesperson said : ‘ @entity1 invites panellists who reflect a significant range of opinions on a number of different topics			0
' whilst mr @entity0 ’s views are entirely his own , as an mp he has a right to appear on the programme and has done so previously			1
