the assault , carried out with a metal rod , transfixed @entity7 with its brutality and led to nationwide protests calling for better policing and harsher punishments for violent crimes against women			1
in response , @entity7 ’s @entity47 passed legislation raising the maximum punishment for rape from life imprisonment to the death penalty , as well as criminalising offenses such as stalking and voyeurism			1
women ’s rights advocates say public discussion in the aftermath of the crime chipped away at the stigma associated with sex crimes , as well as the way some victims of assaults perceived themselves			2
in @entity5 alone for instance , more than 1,500 rapes were reported in 2013 – the highest in over a decade – and up from 706 in 2012			2
harassment reports jumped fivefold from the 2012 figure			2
@entity5 police say the increase is n’t due to rising crime rates , but to women ’s new - found willingness to report abuse			2
v for vindicated : neighbours of the victim show their support after her killers were sentenced to death in september celebration : well - wishers who have followed the case were present at the lower court in september to support the teenager 's parents justice @entity88 and justice @entity89 announced the verdict today at the @entity91 but the defence said they will now appeal in the @entity94			1

' @entity7 protesters hold banners and wear black ribbons during a rally in @entity5 in december 2012 , following the cremation of the victim in the @entity7 capital @entity7 protesters hold candles during a rally in @entity5 late december 2012 , after the death of a gang rape victim from the @entity7 capital however , @entity95 is still disappointed that this and many other rape cases in @entity7 are taking so long to get through the judicial system			1
he added : ' i have one complaint against our judicial system			0
the case has become a landmark case in our country and the whole world is watching the pace in which justice is being done			0
' the defence has already said they 'll be appealing to the @entity94 so i hope they move fast and not delay			0
' delaying it will deny justice to @entity96 , her family , me and the convicts			0
the more they delay the more affect it will have on us all mentally			0
' the defence lawyer said that justice has not been done			0
our judicial system gives him every right to put forth his side , but i have only one thing to tell him ' truth always prevails '			0
' if @entity96 is watching , which i am sure she is , she will get peace after this judgement			0
' a 1980 @entity94 ruling allowed the death penalty in murder cases where the ' collective conscience of the community is so shocked that it will expect the holders of the judicial power to inflict death penalty			2
