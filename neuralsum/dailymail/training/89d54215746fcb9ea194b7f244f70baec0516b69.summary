former @entity1 fighters who deserted the terror group have leaked a set of chilling letters purportedly containing the handwritten orders and commands of senior commanders			1
the notes contain orders for @entity11 militants to carry out suicide bomb explosions , to besiege villages in @entity14 and @entity15 and even to claim credit for last month 's terror attacks in the @entity19 capital , @entity20			1
each of the letters is signed with a purple stamp , indicating the province from which it was sent , and are understood to have been handed to @entity11 ' network of messengers and fighters , whose job it is to pass on or act upon the information contained in the letters			2
brutal : this letter dated august 22 last year refers to the distribution of ' relief goods ' - understood to be food and medical supplies			0
in it the commander of @entity40 province demands a militant named @entity43 ensures the supplies are only given to the @entity46 brothers [ fighters ] , not the suffering local population claim : the letter on the right contains an order for a militant named @entity53 to contact the @entity11 media office in @entity55 immediately in order to take responsibility for @entity20 ' @entity59 terror attack demonstration : thousands of @entity19 citizens are seen taking part in a solidarity march through the streets of @entity20 after last month 's terror attacks left 17 people dead			1
@entity11 later claimed responsibility for the atrocities the letters have not been independently verified and @entity11 are yet to comment on them , but they were originally published on a @entity71 account claiming to represent @entity11 ' @entity73 - affiliated enemy in @entity14 , @entity74 - also known as the @entity74			1
each of the handwritten notes was shared on the social media website with the hashtag @entity78 and came with an explanation that they had originally been given to jihadis who had fled @entity11 , according to @entity83			1
the men are now said to be fighting for @entity74 in the @entity14 province of @entity55 - an @entity11 stronghold - and are determined to expose the inner workings of the barbaric terror group which has seized control of vast swathes of @entity14 and @entity15 in its campaign of rape and massacre			1
one letter purportedly sent from @entity40 on january 13 contained an order for a militant named @entity97 to contact the @entity11 media office in @entity55 immediately in order to claim responsibility for the @entity59 terror attack in @entity20 six days earlier			1
another letter sent on may 13 last year contains a sickening order for a fighter named @entity105 to organise a suicide bomb attack on the ' disbelievers of @entity108 ' - a village near @entity55			1
the note insists ' one of the brothers from the [ @entity114 ] peninsula ' carry out the atrocity			0
giving orders : the letters have not been independently verified and @entity11 are yet to comment on them , but they were originally published on a @entity71 account claiming to represent @entity11 ' @entity73 - affiliated enemy in @entity14 , @entity74 - also known as the @entity74 bloodthirsty : the letter on the left was sent on may 13 last year and contains a sickening order for a fighter named @entity105 to organise a suicide bomb attack on the ' disbelievers of @entity108 ' - a village near @entity55			1
the note insists ' one of the brothers from the [ @entity114 ] peninsula ' carry out the atrocity militants : each of the letters is signed with a purple stamp , indicating the province from which it was sent			2
they are understood to have been handed to @entity11 ' network of messengers and fighters another letter purportedly sent by the @entity1 on august 22 last year refers to the distribution of ' relief goods ' - understood to be food and medical supplies			2
in it the commander of @entity40 province demands a militant named @entity43 ensures the supplies are only given to the @entity46 brothers [ fighters ] , not the suffering local population			0
each of the letters is signed with a blue stamp , which appears to indicate authenticity and the province from which it was sent			0
the vast majority of the leaked letters were sent between commanders in @entity40 and @entity55 provinces			2
@entity55 is also where the branch of the @entity73 - affiliated @entity74 terror group - who say they came in to possession of the letters when local @entity11 fighters defected - claim to be based			1
the letters are among the first indications of how the terrorist organisation operates			0
the brief , handwritten instructions recall the so - called ' pizzini ' @entity172 boss @entity171 used to communicate with the rank and file while on the run from the authorities in the 1990s			0
the emergence of the letters comes amid reports that @entity11 ' leadership has been decimated by months of sustained air strikes , leaving the terror group in chaos and isolating leader @entity184 ( pictured ) dead : among the dead jihadis is @entity188 ( left ) , a former @entity15 army lieutenant colonel considered @entity191 's number two and @entity11 ' most senior militant in @entity15			1
another former member of @entity194 's army turned @entity11 commander , @entity195 ( right ) , has also been killed the jihadi who murdered two civilians in @entity199 swore allegiance to @entity1 just nine minutes before his first attack			2
@entity202 declared his devotion to the terror group on his @entity206 page and then gunned down a film director at a free speech debate in @entity209			1
the 22 - year - old fanatic later killed a volunteer security guard at a synagogue before police shot him dead			0
last night it emerged that @entity199 intelligence service @entity215 was warned that @entity202 had become radicalised while in prison			0
a senior member of his former gang , called the @entity220 , said @entity202 had been released two weeks ago			1
@entity221 added : ' when he went inside he was a member of our gang			0
he lived his life with us			0
we would drive around , smoke hashish together , fight rival gangs			0
this is the @entity202 that i knew			0
' but when he came out he changed			0
he stopped keeping in touch with the @entity220			0
the emergence of the letters comes amid reports that the @entity1 's leadership in @entity14 and @entity15 has been decimated by months of sustained air strikes , leaving the terror group in chaos and isolating leader @entity184			1
@entity238 airstrikes , including those carried out by @entity241 warplanes , have killed more than 6,000 fighters since september , including more than half the militants serving on @entity11 ' ruling council			2
among the dead jihadis is @entity188 , a former @entity15 army lieutenant colonel considered @entity191 's number two and @entity11 ' most senior militant in @entity15			2
his death and that of as many as nine others on @entity11 ' 18 - man leadership council have forced @entity191 to promote local warlords to the status of regional commanders			2
this because his inner circle of trusted advisers and battle - hardened loyalists is becoming increasingly small the longer the airstrikes continue targeting the terror group			1
@entity191 has not been seen in public since july and there have been numerous unconfirmed reports that he suffered serious injury or possibly even death as a result of targeted airstrikes			0
the likelihood , however , is that @entity191 has been forced deep into hiding to avoid being targeted by jets that have destroyed more than 1,000 vehicles used by terrorists over the past five months			0
other senior figures within the terror group have not been afforded that luxury and still need to travel across the vast swathes of @entity14 and @entity15 that remain under @entity11 ' control			1
this forces them to make a decision whether to move as part of a large military convoy and risk being spotted by warplanes overhead , or whether to use cars that reduce the likelihood of aerial detection but leave them at risk of kidnap or killing at the hands if @entity11 ' rivals on the ground .			0
