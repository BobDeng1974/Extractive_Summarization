motorists ’ satisfaction with @entity3 ’s potholed roads has plummeted to a record low			2
fewer than one in three drivers say they are happy with the state of the roads - the lowest level since surveys began in 2008 - and the government ’s poor record on repairs is to blame for the abysmal ratings , a damning report by @entity7 watchdogs concludes today			1
it condemns as ‘ ludicrous ’ the @entity21 ’s patch - and - mend ‘ piecemeal ’ funding			2
they say this is making it difficult to maintain @entity3 ’s road network cost - effectively and is leaving millions of drivers frustrated			1
the government ’s poor record on repairs is to blame for the abysmal driver satisfaction ratings			2
file picture compensation pay - outs for damages caused by poor road conditions cost £ 31.6million last year alone			1
they condemned the decades of ‘ unpredictable and fluctuating budgets ’ for road maintenance and said ministers should realise that with potholes costing £ 52 to fill in – rising to £ 70 in @entity39 - ‘ prevention is better than cure ’			1
but they also attack local councils and the @entity44 for not even knowing where their drains are			0
the @entity47 said motorists were paying the price of such ignorance with ‘ pools , ponds and puddles that blight @entity55 roads ’ because of poor drainage maintenance by highways authorities			1
@entity59 chairman @entity58 blasted the @entity21 the powerful @entity59 ( @entity60 ) says the @entity21 ( @entity21 ) had slashed the roads maintenance budget , only to have to make repeated emergency injections of cash to deal with fall - out from floods and other problems			1
the report says that since maintenance budgets were cut by £ 1.2billion over four years from april 2011 , the committee said the @entity21 has had to provide extra funding on nine occasions , totalling £ 1.1billion			2
committee chairman @entity58 said : ‘ the department ’s piecemeal and stop - go approach to funding for road maintenance in recent decades has made it difficult for highways authorities to maintain roads cost - effectively			1
‘ there has been too much reactive work in response to flooding and other events and not enough focus on preventative work that is less expensive in the long term			0
’ she said : ‘ public satisfaction with the condition of our roads is at the lowest level since the surveying of this began in 2008			2
‘ in the last survey only 30 per cent of the public were satisfied with the condition of the roads and the speed and quality of repairs			2
’ mrs @entity58 said : ‘ the @entity21 ’s unpredictable and fluctuating budgets for road maintenance over decades have put value for money at risk			0
‘ it seems ludicrous that in 2010 the @entity21 cut road maintenance budgets by £ 1.2billion over the four years from april 2011 , but then it has intermittently given £ 1.1billion additional funding on nine separate occasions for various reasons , including in response to flooding or winter damage to the roads			1
’ the greatest problems are in @entity39 and the @entity117 , according to the @entity21			0
mrs @entity58 said : ‘ @entity118 must see that prevention is better than cure			0
it costs £ 52 to fill in a pothole , or £ 70 in @entity39 , yet it costs over £ 30million to pay and process compensation claims from road users for damages arising from poor road conditions			1
’ mps cited experts at @entity55 who say savings of up to 20 per cent are achievable when there is ‘ certainty of funding			1
’ the @entity44 , which is an executive agency of the @entity21 , is responsible for maintaining the strategic road network			0
file pictures mrs @entity58 said : ‘ whilst we understand the unpredictable nature of winter weather , too much road maintenance is inefficient because it is reactive and unplanned			0
‘ concentrating activity in the winter months is inefficient and costly			0
some local highway authorities are far too reactive to events , rather than anticipating , predicting and preventing disrepair			0
’ she noted : ‘ better information , better planning of funding and a pro-active stance on maintenance are what the @entity21 must promote to have a chance of pleasing unhappy road users			0
’ the @entity59 report says the @entity21 and the @entity44 are making some progress in improving the way in which road maintenance is carried out ‘ but more needs to be done			0
’ it notes : ‘ public satisfaction with the condition of our roads is at the lowest level since the survey assessing confidence began			0
’ the @entity44 , which is an executive agency of the @entity21 , is responsible for maintaining the strategic road network spanning 4,400 miles including almost all of @entity3 ’s motorways and its most important ‘ a ’ roads			1
the remaining 183,000 miles of local roads are maintained by 152 local highway authorities			0
public spending on maintaining @entity3 ’s roads in 2012 - 13 was £ 4billion			1
astonished that the @entity44 holds no information on 70per cent of its drainage systems , it said : ‘ a good understanding of the state of the roads is absolutely essential for planning cost - effective preventative maintenance ’			1
@entity47 president @entity178 said its own surveys showed that while its members are relatively satisfied with the state of motorways and trunk roads , one in five say local roads are ‘ terrible ’			2
he said : ‘ @entity185 reflects this public anger			0
’ ‘ it puts pressure on central government to work more closely with local government to carry out the basics			0
effective and regular road maintenance that gives the taxpayer value for money and does the job			0
’ he added : ‘ central government ’s stop - start funding over many years has simply patched up the @entity55 ’s roads			1
’ lack of ring - fencing of local authority funds for road maintenance has added to this ‘ sorry state ’ .			1
