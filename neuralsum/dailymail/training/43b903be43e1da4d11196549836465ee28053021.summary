by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 are on the brink of losing more first team stars with @entity5 and @entity6 holding discussions with @entity8 on tuesday over a double move			1
manager @entity10 reacted angrily on monday following the decision to sell @entity12 and @entity13 to @entity14 , claiming the moves away from the @entity16 were against his wishes			1
@entity5 was a crucial component of the @entity19 last term after joining for £ 1million from @entity21 , playing 49 times in total			2
royal approval : @entity6 ( left ) and @entity5 have held talks over a move to @entity8 @entity6 arrived from @entity27 for £ 2million in 2012 and along with @entity5 had become a crucial part of the @entity2 attack in the last year			2
a move to @entity8 would see @entity6 play in a second spell at the @entity32 having begun his career with the @entity8 in 2005 , making just a handful of substitute appearances before leaving for @entity36 three years later			0
for @entity10 , the loss of two forwards will be a major blow ahead of the new @entity19 campaign , and will only add fuel to the fire in his rift with club owner @entity44			1
although the departure of @entity12 and @entity13 will see the duo loaned back to the club for the 2014/15 campaign , the former under 21 boss was unhappy at the sales worth around £ 7million			1
dispute : @entity44 has hit back at @entity10 's claims he was left in the dark at @entity2 stars : but @entity12 and @entity13 were sold on the cheap to @entity56 side @entity14 ' the players were sold without my sanction ' , @entity10 said			1
' i ca n't defend the decision to sell them because it was n't my decision			0
i could sit here and lie and dress it up a little bit and cover the tracks of one or two individuals , but i 'm not prepared to do that			0
' however , @entity44 responded claiming : ' i would love nothing more than to hold on to our best young players			0
i gave both @entity13 and @entity12 lengthy new contracts in august 2013 and march 2014 respectively			0
' the manager and i openly discussed the proposed sale of @entity13 and @entity12 and he was aware of the negotiations throughout			0
