@entity0 toll : thousands will die because of the cold this winter - while millions say they fret over heating bills more than three million older people are worried about staying warm indoors this winter – with six million anxious about rising fuel bills , says @entity8			1
the charity said its research shows many are unaware of the potentially fatal consequences of living in poorly heated housing			2
cold temperatures endanger the elderly by increasing the risk of flu , chest infections and other respiratory problems , and their severity			1
being cold also pushes up blood pressure which may trigger heart attacks and strokes			1
almost one in four people ( 22 per cent ) taking part in the research did not know that a number of serious health problems are made worse or brought on by the cold			1
this rose to 29 per cent amongst people aged 80 and over			0
fewer than one in 10 @entity32 aged 65 and over are aware that strokes can be brought on by the cold in winter , with only 14 per cent recognising that the cold can impact on heart attacks			1
the survey marks the launch of @entity8 ’s spread the warmth winter campaign , which is aimed at cutting the 24,000 excess winter deaths that occur nationally each winter			0
@entity41 , charity director of @entity8 , said ‘ it ’s vital for older people to keep warm , both inside and outside their homes in the winter months			2
‘ being cold , even for just a short amount of time can be very dangerous as it increases the risk of associated health problems and preventable deaths during the winter			1
’ ‘ through our spread the @entity54 campaign , we are calling on everyone to recognise the importance of staying warm and well this winter and to think about older friends , neighbours and relatives as the temperature drops			0
’ living room temperatures should ideally be kept at @entity62 ( @entity63 ) and above whereas bedroom temperatures should be kept at a minimum of @entity66 ( @entity67 ) , according to international guidelines ( from @entity69 )			2
@entity70 , @entity71 general secretary , described price rises from energy companies as ' eye - watering ' but the survey of 1,100 @entity32 aged 65 and over found four out of five did not know the ideal living room and bedroom temperatures			1
among their major concerns this winter were staying warm at home cited by 28 per cent of respondents – equivalent to three million older people nationwide – and the soaring cost of energy bills , selected by 55 per cent			2
official advice issued last week told elderly people unable to afford fuel bills to heat only their living rooms during daytime this winter			0
cold temperatures endanger the elderly by increasing the risk of flu , chest infections and other respiratory problems @entity99 also suggests they keep the heating in their bedroom off until just before going to bed			1
@entity32 ’s biggest pensioners ’ organisation , the @entity103 ( @entity71 ) has launched an online poster campaign urging its 1.5m members to email energy secretary @entity107 over the number of older people that die every year of cold - related illnesses			1
@entity70 , @entity71 general secretary said ‘ every year over 25,000 older people die in this country from cold - related illnesses and the best the government can do is to tell people to put a jumper on			2
‘ most of the big six energy companies have now announced eye - watering increases in their charges and rather than tackle the scandal of fuel poverty , the government has instead redefined what it is , so as to cut down on the official number of those who can not afford to keep warm			0
‘ ministers have got to get a grip on the problem and start addressing the need for higher winter fuel payments , widespread insulation programmes and the introduction of a block on the right of energy companies to simply put up bills without any regard to the economic climate in which they operate			0
‘ it is a national scandal that ever year thousands of older people die from the cold			0
this has got to stop			0
’ @entity144 mp , @entity145 , said ‘ many older and vulnerable people all across the @entity8 face a choice between heating and eating this winter , and it shows how out of touch @entity150 is that the only solution he offers is advice on what room to heat			0
‘ that ’s why we desperately need a @entity159 government which will freeze energy bills to save money for 27 million households and 2.4 million businesses and reset the market to deliver fairer prices in the future			0
