by @entity0 published : 19:06 est , 4 november 2013 updated : 19:07 est , 4 november 2013 a new test for prostate cancer could spare thousands of men needless treatment which leaves them with debilitating side effects , researchers claim			1
the test can accurately pinpoint the less harmful tumours which do not have to be immediately removed by surgery or radiotherapy			2
prostate is the most common form of cancer in men			2
there are 41,000 new cases in @entity17 a year , mostly among the over- 65s			1
despite half of all prostate tumours being less harmful varieties , 90 per cent of patients have surgery because they are difficult to distinguish from deadly ones around half have a low - risk type of prostate cancer which is not fatal and is highly unlikely to spread to other parts of the body			1
yet due to a lack of effective tests , it is extremely difficult to distinguish between deadly tumours and less harmful ones			2
as such , more than 90 per cent of prostate cancer sufferers undergo surgery or radiotherapy which can cause incontinence and leave them infertile			1
but a team of @entity17 and @entity42 researchers believe a new test called @entity44 could spare thousands of men this treatment , enabling them to live normal lives			2
it costs £ 1,700 a time but the academics say by using it the @entity51 would save money as expensive radiotherapy and surgery could be avoided			1
the £ 1,700 test can determine whether a tumour is deadly or not and the makers say it will save money on expensive surgery and radiotherapy a trial of the test involving 1,500 men , which will be presented at the @entity65 conference in @entity66 , shows that it accurately distinguishes between fatal tumours and the less harmful			1
professor @entity68 , a scientist at @entity69 who is based at @entity71 , said : ‘ over-treatment of prostate cancer is a serious issue so it is essential that we have an accurate way of spotting those cancers that pose an immediate risk			1
‘ for patients with slow - growing tumours , it ’s far safer and kinder to watch and wait			0
we ’ve shown this test is accurate at telling apart these two different tumour types at different stages of treatment			0
’ the test works by analysing the genetic make - up of the tumour after a small piece has been removed			0
it then gives the patient a score from – 3 and +3 , with those at the top end suffering a more aggressive form			0
presently the test can only be analysed in a lab in the @entity42 state of @entity100 so doctors have been reluctant to use it as they have to send samples away			0
but researchers are carrying out further trials on its effectiveness and hope it will be considered by @entity109 , the drugs rationing body , for @entity51 use			0
dr @entity112 , of @entity69 and chairman of the @entity65 , said : ‘ understanding more about the nature of a patient ’s tumour could spare thousands of men from unnecessary treatment and the resulting side effects			0
’ last week , figures from @entity69 showed the amount of men dying from prostate cancer has fallen by a fifth in 20 years due to better diagnosis and treatment			1
however , campaigners say too many men are being failed because of the lack of effective tests .			0

there are 41,000 cases of prostate cancer in @entity17 every year
only half are deadly varieties which are likely to spread
but 90 per cent of patients have surgery because of *inadequate* tests
new £ 1,700 exam could save money by stopping needless *procedures*
