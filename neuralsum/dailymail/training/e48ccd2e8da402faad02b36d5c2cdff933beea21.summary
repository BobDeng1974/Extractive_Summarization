@entity0 came from behind to beat plucky @entity1 on monday night and set up an @entity3 quarter - final clash with @entity4			1
here , @entity6 's @entity5 rates every player for their performance at @entity9			0
@entity1 ( 3 - 4 - 1 - 2 ) @entity10 6 – sound performance but will be cursing @entity12 for getting in his eye - line for the first goal and then going down under little or contact for the penalty he converted			1
@entity19 7 – captain ’s performance from @entity19 and led by example but it just was n’t quite enough in the end			0
@entity19 ( centre ) put in a captain 's performance for @entity27 against @entity0 @entity28 7 – towering display summed up by a challenge on @entity31 in the second half , blocking the @entity34 ’s shot when he looked certain to score from close - range			1
@entity38 6 - @entity37 approach typified by his collision with @entity31 in the first half , but came under increasing pressure as the match wore on			2
@entity43 6.5 – his powerful running down the right - flank for @entity1 gave @entity47 plenty to worry about			0
@entity48 runs away from @entity0 defender @entity49 with the ball @entity51 6.5 – vital role sat in front of the back - four and one superbly - timed challenge on @entity55 brought a roar from the crowd			2
@entity48 6.5 – a veteran of @entity59 ’ cup upset at @entity61 under @entity62 five years , he could n’t be faulted before going off 15 minutes from the end			0
@entity64 7.5 – scored a memorable goal that sent @entity9 into raptures and almost grabbed a second in added time when his header was cleared off the line by @entity71			1
@entity27 left back @entity64 fires the @entity73 side in front in the @entity3 sixth round @entity64 jumps over the advertising hoardings to celebrate with his fans and team - mates at @entity9 @entity79 7 – @entity1 ’s man of the match , he produced a number of impressive set - pieces including one that went inches over in the second half			1
@entity87 6.5 – still a handful at 37 , @entity0 had two or even three players competing with him for high balls at times , and he was not surprisingly booked for flattening @entity93			1
@entity94 7 – @entity62 said that he ’d ruffle feathers and he certainly did			0
@entity1 ’s top scorer went close to another with a header in the second half			0
@entity94 fires a shot towards goal during the fifth round clash subs : @entity104 , @entity105 ( for @entity106 , 6 ) , @entity107 ( for @entity108 75 , 6 ) , @entity109 , @entity110 ( for @entity111 , 6 ) , @entity112 , @entity113 booked : @entity111 , @entity108 , @entity64 , @entity114 @entity0 ( 4 - 1 - 3 - 2 ) @entity115 5.5 – the @entity116 has been @entity0 ’s best player this season but he will be unhappy at the way he allowed @entity64 ’s deflected effort to spin through his grasp when @entity1 took a shock lead early in the second half			1
@entity115 will be unhappy at the way he allowed @entity64 's deflected effort spin through his grasp @entity125 6.5 – the man who deflected @entity64 ’s shot , and the @entity128 could be faulted for not getting tighter on his opponent as he tried his luck from range			2
helped set up @entity31 ’s goal though			0
@entity133 5.5 – looked uncomfortable again with the awkward combination of @entity87 ’s power and @entity94 ’s sheer persistence causing him plenty of problems			0
@entity49 6 – the @entity139 also had his hands full with @entity1 ’s front two and was booked for bringing down @entity94 in the second half			0
@entity47 6 – back after suspension but is still yet to offer the kind of marauding presence @entity0 hoped they were getting when they signed him for £ 28m in the summer			0
@entity147 7 – screened the @entity0 defence capably and it was his determination to keep possession and pass that led to the equaliser			0
@entity93 6.5 – given only his third start since the beginning of december and the man who came up with the breakthrough goal against @entity155 in the third round struck again here			1
@entity93 celebrates after equalising at @entity9 as @entity0 went on to win @entity31 7 – found that his powerful presence was less effective against the @entity73 side , and ended up with a bloody nose after a clash with @entity38 , but came up with @entity0 ’s crucial second goal			1
@entity164 8 – the only one to try and take the game by the scruff of the neck when @entity0 were in trouble , showing real character to go with his undoubted talent on a difficult night			2
@entity31 smashes home the visitors ' second to set up a quarter - final clash with @entity4 at @entity61 @entity164 was vastly improved at @entity9 - he showed character to go with his undoubted talent @entity12 6.5 – back up front but the @entity0 skipper was a little subdued as his team had to come from behind before he won and converted the penalty for @entity0 ’s third			1
@entity180 5 – failed to get on the end of @entity55 ’s freekick early on and replaced with half an hour remaining after another mediocre display			2
no surprise @entity0 prospered after his departure			0
@entity180 struggled once again and was replaced by @entity71 in the second half subs : @entity189 , @entity190 , @entity191 , @entity192 , @entity71 ( for @entity180 60 , 7 ) , @entity193 , @entity194 booked : @entity49 referee : @entity196 @entity197 man : @entity164			1

@entity0 beat @entity27 3 - 1 in the @entity3 fifth round
@entity93 , @entity31 and @entity12 score for @entity0
@entity64 had put the @entity73 side into the lead at @entity9
@entity180 was substituted after an hour and was *disappointing* again
@entity164 drove @entity0 forward and was their star man
