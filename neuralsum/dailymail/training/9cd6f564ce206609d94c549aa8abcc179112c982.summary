a tourist had to be rescued from one of @entity3 's highest mountains after attempting to climb the peak wearing flip - flops			1
the walker and two friends were exploring 4,006ft @entity8 in @entity9 near @entity10 to " see the snow " when he slipped and hurt his ankle on wednesday night			1
a team from @entity15 were called out and said they were " amazed " to see the casualty 's choice of footwear			1
painful lesson : the unnamed tourist , pictured left , had to be stretchered off the mountain by rescuers they reported that one of the injured man 's companions was bare - foot when they saw him and the other was wearing trainers			1
members of @entity15 stretchered the injured man to the mountain 's gondola lift and then on to a waiting ambulance which took him to the @entity35 at @entity10			1
it is understood the trio had taken the gondola up the mountain - a sister peak of the @entity43 's highest mountain , @entity44 - on wednesday and then walked to the goose area which still has pockets of snow			1
rescue team leader @entity48 said : ' we found them 20 minutes from the top of the gondola - which the staff especially kept open for us to get up			1
the were on the grass			0
we do n't know if they actually had reached the snow or were on their way back from it			2
there is still plenty of deep snow on the hill			2
' but they said they wanted to stand on snow in @entity3			1
we do n't know if they actually did			0
the grass was wet enough to have an accident - especially in flip - flops			0
' big draw : the group were exploring 4,006ft @entity8 in @entity9 near @entity10 to " see the snow " mr @entity48 said his team were amazed at the group 's choice of footwear : ' people really need to wear the right shoes			1
it is still wet in places on the hill and ironically the chap who had bare feet was probably better off than his companions ' ' one of our team members , @entity84 , actually hurled one of the flips - flops and told the guy ' that 's how much use they are on the hill ! ' he went and got it back for him but the bloke got the message			1
we believe they were from abroad and were tourists			0
' i know in some countries they wear flip - flops to climb hills but we told them next time they come back to @entity3 to stand on snow wear something more appropriate - like a good pair of boots			2
' they said they were sorry for ' all the fuss			0
'' despite the onset of summer , a snow warning was issued to climbers and walkers on neighbouring @entity44 , @entity43 's highest mountain , and other @entity3 mountains only two weeks ago			1
but the @entity118 warned that ' winter is still lingering on the roof of @entity3			0
' team effort : images on @entity15 's website show a rescuer carrying a stretcher and the rescue team 's doctor , @entity128 , making their way up the mountain @entity131 , the @entity132 with the 12,000 - strong @entity133 , advised those heading to climb 4409 - ft @entity44 to be aware of the late lying snow beds and " be cautious			1
" ' walking on snow in summer can really add to your day out on the hill and be a lot of fun if the snow is relatively flat			2
however , be warned : if you take a slip and start to slide - is there a chance that slide could take you over the edge ? ' she said			0
' there are still large cornices - ledges of snow hanging over the edge of the cliff face - on @entity44 and many other @entity152 ( mountains over 3000 ft )			2
' care should be taken to avoid these and stay on the rocky terrain - particularly in misty conditions when it might be difficult to see the edge			0
' ms morning added that a particular risk was in the underfoot conditions			0
the @entity3 mountains hold snow long into the spring and early summer			2
these snow patches will often be hard and located high up on the shady , north side of the mountain			2
hill walkers are advised to treat these old snow patches with caution , particularly if the ' run out ' below is over steep ground			1
@entity171 , the @entity173 's hill walking officer , said : ' when spring arrives a lot of people feel the pull of the mountains and want to get outdoors again			0
but sometimes people get caught out at this time of year			0
while it may feel like spring has sprung at low levels , up on the mountain tops it can be a very different story			0
' if you 're going into the hills remember you may encounter the white stuff - anything from the odd patch to large areas			0
so be prepared ! '			0
