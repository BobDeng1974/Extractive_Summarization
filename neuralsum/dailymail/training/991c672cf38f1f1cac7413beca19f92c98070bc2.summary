the @entity1 is sending three warplanes to help locate the @entity4 schoolgirls taken by an @entity6 terror group , it has been reported			1
four months ago @entity7 , which is fighting to reinstate a medieval @entity9 caliphate in religiously mixed @entity4 , abducted more than 200 schoolgirls from the village of @entity12 and they remain missing			1
now , three @entity1 @entity13 outfitted with surveillance equipment are being deployed to the @entity16 nation to fly reconnaissance missions over the region the group is known to operate in			1
according to the report , the mission is dependent on a nearby nation giving them permission to use a runway			2
an @entity37 spokesman did not deny the report about the deployment of the planes , adding : ' the @entity41 continues to work with the @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity4 , its neighbours and international partners to provide advice and assistance to the @entity48			1
' together with our allies we have provided continuous surveillance support to the @entity4 authorities , including satellite imagery			1
we are still in discussion with partners on the deployment of further surveillance capability			2
' earlier this month suspected @entity59 fighters have abducted dozens of boys and men from a village in northeast @entity4 , according to witnesses			1
after loading them onto trucks and driving them off more 97 people are now missing			0
engines : two rolls @entity70 turbofans			0
aircrew : 2 the @entity79 pod , substituted in place of weaponry , is one of the most advanced reconnaissance sensors in the world and greatly increases the effectiveness of the aircraft in the reconnaissance role			2
its introduction into service gave the @entity91 the ability to transmit real - time , @entity94 ( @entity95 ) to commanders or to view this in cockpit during a mission			0
the stand - off range of the sensors also allows the aircraft to remain outside heavily defended areas , thus minimising the aircraft â€™s exposure to enemy air - defence systems			0
source : @entity1 @entity7 leader @entity108 in a video he sent taunting the @entity4 government over the kidnapping of the girls from their boarding school dormitory in april several witnesses who fled after the raid on @entity117 , a sandy fishing village near the shores of @entity120 , said militants clothed in military and police uniforms had burned several houses			1
' they left no men or boys in the place ; only young children , girls and women , ' said @entity130 , sobbing softly and looking exhausted after a 110 mile road trip on the back of a truck to @entity134 , capital of the northeastern state of @entity136			0
' they were shouting ' @entity137 ' ( @entity138 is greatest ) , shooting sporadically			0
' they started parking our men and boys into their vehicles , threatening to shoot whoever disobey them			0
' firefighters and rescuers extinguish a fire at the scene of a bomb blast at @entity153 in the central city of @entity155 , @entity4			1
@entity157 car bombings attributed to @entity158 in may killed at least 46 people they said six older men were also killed in sunday 's raid , while another five people were wounded			0
@entity7 , seen as the number one security threat to @entity167 's top economy and oil producer , has dramatically increased attacks on civilians in the past year , and the once - grassroots movement has rapidly lost popular support as it gets more bloodthirsty			1
its solution - kidnapping boys and forcing them to fight and abducting girls as sex slaves - is a chilling echo of @entity179 rebel @entity177 's @entity176 , which has operated in the same way in @entity179 , @entity181 and @entity167 for decades			0
the kidnappers overpowered local vigilantes who had no support because this is no military presence there , the villagers said			2
@entity188 , another villager who fled to @entity134 , said the invaders had taunted the men for being unable to defend themselves			0
plight : a woman attends a demonstration in @entity194 , @entity4 , in may urging the government to increase efforts to rescue the hundreds of abducted students from a secondary school ' they were shouting ' where is your pride ? you people used to be warriors			1
today you are all just women , not as brave as we thought ' , ' he said			0
he said that from his @entity209 clan alone , some 47 people were missing and feared to have been abducted			2
the raid shows how mobile @entity7 units can be			1
after a military offensive in may last year broke their hold on the area around @entity120 in the far northeast of @entity136 , the rebels relocated to the south of the state , near the @entity220 border nearly 300 km ( 190 miles ) away			2
@entity12 , where the girls were taken from , is in this area			0
their re-appearance in the area demonstrates their ability to move across vast swathes of northeastern @entity4 without being intercepted by the military			1
@entity4 forces are overstretched against a determined foe			2
in the past week they have fought gun battles with @entity158 in two key towns in the south of @entity234 , the security sources said , and the garrison town of @entity237 , which the militants sacked a month ago .			0

planes will fly reconnaissance missions over @entity4 , it has been reported
fighter bombers to supply vital intel to the @entity4 military
comes four months after @entity7 abducted more than 200 schoolgirls
