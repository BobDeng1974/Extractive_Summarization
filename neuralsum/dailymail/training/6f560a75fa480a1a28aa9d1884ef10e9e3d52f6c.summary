some premature babies should start school a year late to give their brains time to develop , experts have claimed			1
the call follows a study which found that boys and girls born early are 50 per cent more likely to fail the reading , writing and maths tests given at the end of their second year in school			1
children born before 37 weeks of pregnancy are also more likely to be diagnosed as having dyslexia , deafness and other problems that class them as having special educational needs			0
struggling : a study found many of the learning difficulties experienced by premature children are simply due to them starting school too early however , the @entity26 study found that some of their learning difficulties are simply due to them starting school too early			1
campaigners argue that if they started school on the date they were due to be born , rather than the date they actually arrived , they would do better			2
children in @entity34 generally start school in the september after their fourth birthday			2
this means that a child born several weeks prematurely on august 31 would begin a year earlier than they would have if they had been carried to full - term			0
the researchers analysed medical and education information gathered on almost 12,000 children born in the @entity45 area			0
more than 700 were born prematurely			0
overall , the premature children were more likely to do badly in the tests given at the end of the second year of primary school			1
campaigners argue that if children started school on the date they were due to be born , rather than the date they actually arrived , they would do better plus , 35 per cent had special educational needs			1
this compares with the 23 per cent of their full - term classmates			0
strikingly , the study found that those children who were born close to cut - off date for staring school – and so started their education earlier than they would have otherwise done – did worse			2
this suggests their problems were n’t solely caused by damage done by their early birth			0
instead their brains were still maturing and they might have done better if they ’d started school later			0
researcher dr @entity70 said that up to one in six premature babies start school early			1
he said : ‘ it is easy to look at a premature child ’s date of birth and think that is how old they are but they are not that old			0
‘ these children are going to school in some cases a year earlier than they would have done			2
‘ development does n’t speed up just because you are born earlier			0
they still have to go through all the developmental stages			0
’ the study , published in the journal @entity86 showed that it was not just very premature babies that suffer , with some of those born just five or six weeks early doing badly when starting school			1
previous research has shown that summer - born children , who , like some premature babies , are young for their year , do worse at school and are less likely to get a place at university			2
@entity94 , of the @entity95 , which believes children are being pushed into formal education too young , said : ‘ it is now evident that not only are summer - born children particularly disadvantaged by an early start to formal learning but also pre-term infants – and we show that such early disadvantage is likely to then impact onto the whole of their school lives			1
’ sir @entity108 , a retired professor of child health and a former @entity110 , said : ‘ education experts must look at these data and argue for a change in policy so that the school entry age for children born prematurely is based on their expected due date rather than their premature date of birth			1
’ however , dr @entity70 said that more research is needed to rule out possibilities such as premature children being stigmatised or bullied if they start school late .			1

@entity26 study finds that some learning difficulties are due to premature children starting school too early
