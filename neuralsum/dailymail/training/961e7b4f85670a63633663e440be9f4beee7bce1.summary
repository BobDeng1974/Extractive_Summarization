@entity1 usually spends his time plucking sea bass from the ocean			2
but , having recently bought a metal detector and taken up treasure hunting as a hobby , he struck gold in a field in @entity21 , @entity2 , finding 15 bronze and silver coins that may have been lying there for 2,000 years			1
mr @entity1 , 41 , began his hobby when he purchased the detector for £ 300 from a friend who wanted to upgrade his own			1
after scouring the field , he unearthed the first coin and , initially , that seemed to be it			2
' i had a quick search and could n’t find anything else , ' he said			0
' i had to go home for sunday roast			0
but i went back the next day , and that ’s when i came across more			0
' the machine was giving off such faint , intermittent signals that his friend did not think it was worth the effort of digging , but he persevered ,			0
and the rest is history			0
he followed the required procedure in reporting the discovery under the @entity48 , which encourages the voluntary recording of archaeological objects found by members of the public in @entity53 and @entity54			0
the local finds liaison officer realised its significance immediately			0
although its financial value is low – just a few hundred pounds - the hoard is historically very important			0
exciting discovery : two of the @entity62 coins found by mr @entity1 , 41			1
these show the head of @entity65 pot luck : mr @entity1 made the amazing discovery just weeks after he bought a metal detector from a friend for £ 300			2
the piece on the left shows the bare head of @entity73 impressive haul : in total , mr @entity1 came across 15 coins - thought to have been dropped by a soldier some 2,000 years ago			1
the coin on the left features the head of @entity81 , the @entity82 of beginnings and transitions @entity85 , a @entity11 expert , said the moeny is likely to have been dropped by a soldier at the time @entity88 first came to the country			1
' these coins are likely to be close in date to the conquest of @entity92 in ad 43			0
they almost pinpoint the time when the @entity88 were first in @entity92			0
it ’s one of the earliest things we have			0
this is a very exciting discovery			1
' the coins - three different currencies all circulating in @entity92 in the middle of the first century @entity102 - include large bronze coins of the roman emperor @entity73 issued between ad 41 and 50			2
proud : mr @entity1 is going to make a trip to the @entity11 , where his haul , believed to be worth a few hundred pounds , is being displayed ' hoards which can be dated with confidence to the early years of the @entity110 conquest are incredibly rare , ' said ms @entity85			1
the coins amount to 4.25 denarii which would have paid for about a week ’s food for a soldier - one denarius would have bought eight loaves of bread			1
the question of how and why coin hoards were buried in the @entity62 period is currently being investigated by a new research project at the @entity11 and @entity121			2
mr @entity1 is planning to visit the @entity11 , where the coins have just gone on show in the @entity124 .			1
