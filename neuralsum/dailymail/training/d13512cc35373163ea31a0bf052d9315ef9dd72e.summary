by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 have curbed their spending this summer , but manager @entity4 is safe in the knowledge that the club ’s board will back him to the hilt should he want to splash the cash			1
the @entity10 , who travel to @entity12 on saturday , surprised many by finishing 10th in the @entity14 last season after spending £ 2.5million on @entity17 striker @entity16 among others			1
and while that initial financial outlay has subsided somewhat — a decision the manager insists was made by himself rather than those above — they are confident of mixing it around the play - offs			0
content : @entity2 boss @entity4 is pleased with the club 's dealings this summer ‘ we ’ve got a stronger squad and we ’re in a better place this time than last year , ’ he said			1
@entity4 did lose top scorer @entity30 to @entity31 for £ 3m this summer , but wisely reinvested some of that fee on striker @entity34 from @entity35			1
signing the 22 - year - old typifies his management in that @entity2 are a club who look to nurture			2
‘ we believe we have a very strong squad at a good age , ’ @entity4 added			0
‘ it ’s difficult to find better players than we have with the budget constraints we ’re under			0
if you ca n’t find an improvement , why bother bringing anyone in ? you ’re better developing the players rather than bringing new people in			0
that ’s always been my methodology			0
’ transfer : @entity34 , above , joined the club from @entity35 after @entity34 was sold to @entity31 for £ 3m it ’s certainly astute given that @entity2 have twice collapsed into insolvency — in 1997 and 2008 — before owner @entity57 overhauled the club and funded a tilt at only their second ever spell at @entity61			1
@entity4 puts the rise down to strong communication between boss and board , intimating that it is now time to kick on further			2
asked if money would be made available in january should the club be in a position to reach the top six , @entity4 said : ‘ when the time comes that we feel we need to go to them then i ’m sure they ’ll back us			2
‘ they ’ve never turned me down through a disagreement on a recruitment purchase			0
