mr @entity0 , 63 , had been sitting directly below the fallen section of the @entity6 ’s ceiling and was among the most seriously injured of the 76 casualties			1
yesterday he said it was ‘ miraculous ’ that he had survived - and that it ‘ beggared belief ’ that more people had not been seriously hurt			1
‘ my wife did say she heard some cracking from above but i did n’t hear anything , i was focused on the stage so it all came completely out of the blue			2
‘ i had no inclination whatsoever that anything was wrong			0
‘ i felt a very hard blow to the head and one to the arm , my wife says i just took her hand , stood up and walked out but i do n’t remember anything			2
‘ the next thing i knew we were in the foyer and there were police everywhere			0

wounds : mr and mrs @entity61 were recovering at home today after the incident when the ceiling began to collapse they were pelted with rubble and plaster from above			1

mr @entity0 was left with a suspected broken arm and a deep gash to his head			1
he was eventually discharged at 4am with 12 stitches in his head and another five in his arm			1
he said : ‘ the cut in my head was very deep and it was full of debris so it took the doctors a really long time to clean it all out			2

mrs @entity61 , a former ladieswear assistant , escaped with minor injuries and , although badly shaken by the experience , did not require hospital treatment			0
@entity93 : it took doctors until 4am to remove all the debris from mr @entity0 's head , leaving him with 12 stitches the couple were collected by two of their three grown - up sons who rushed down from @entity50 to drive them home			1
speaking about seeing the pictures of his bandaged and bloodied head in the news mr @entity0 , a retired corporate sales manager said he did n’t initially realise how bad his injuries were			1
recovering at home yesterday he added : ‘ i wondered why everyone was staring at me , it hurt a lot but i must have been in shock because i did n’t realise how bad it was			2
‘ i ’m very sore today and have a terrible headache but i suppose that is to be expected			0
‘ it ’s ironic because the tickets were given to us as a gift by my wife ’s brother			0
if i had bought the tickets we would have got the cheap ones up in the stalls and we would have been alright , so they are feeling very guilty indeed			0
‘ we come down to go to the theatre once or twice a year so although this is not the sort of thing you expect when you book tickets i do n’t think it will put us off			0
‘ the emergency services were superb and coped extraordinarily well under the circumstances			0
‘ it just seems to me that we were very lucky with how things went , it beggars belief how much worse it could have been			0
