no receipt : @entity1 has never been asked for a receipt from @entity3 despite cleaning the windows at his @entity6 home once a month @entity3 was accused of ‘ total hypocrisy ’ last night after his window cleaner revealed he has never asked for a receipt in 17 years			1

the firm cleans the windows at the three - storey @entity34 family home once a month , charging £ 12 each time			1

but she added : ‘ i ’m not doing anything wrong here , i ’m just telling you the facts and i do n’t give him a receipt and he does n’t ask for a receipt			2
’ mrs @entity36 said the well - established family firm had never been asked for a receipt by any of its customers			2
instead they simply take cash or cheque or write their customers a note to inform them money is due			0
her son @entity56 , 34 , who cleans the @entity57 ’ windows , said : ‘ it only takes me about ten minutes to do , it ’s no problem			0

‘ i see a cleaner sometimes , but i have never seen either of them or even met them			0
’ conservative mp @entity67 last night said it was ‘ absurd ’ to expect people to get receipts for everything and it was hypocritical of mr @entity3 to suggest it			1
' total hypocrisy ' : the @entity10 has been slammed by @entity75 mp @entity67 , who said it was ‘ absurd ’ to expect people to get receipts for everything and it was hypocritical of mr @entity3 to suggest it he said : ‘ having lectured the nation on the need to demand receipts , it turns out he does n’t even do it himself			1
‘ it is total hypocrisy from a man who wants to be considered as a potential chancellor			0
’ he added : ‘ this idea from @entity3 was ludicrous from the start – you ca n’t expect people to demand a receipt for every minor job they have done			1
it is basically suggesting that every small trader is dodging tax , which is a slur			0
’ work and pensions secretary @entity99 said mr @entity3 ’s comments suggested @entity101 was planning a ‘ @entity105 ’ state where people ’s every action was monitored			2
even @entity101 business spokesman @entity106 admitted : ‘ i have to confess i do n’t keep a receipt for every single thing that i get people to do			0
’ a spokesman for mr @entity3 last night said his practice of demanding receipts applied only to jobs where he pays in cash			1
he pointed out that mr @entity3 pays his window cleaner by cheque and receives handwritten invoices every few months			1
the spokesman said : ‘ as @entity3 said , he asks for receipts when paying in cash for work done so that , as @entity10 , he knows he has a written record			1
‘ @entity123 to say , a cheque obviously means both sides have a written record of the transaction			0
‘ @entity3 ’s window cleaner sends a bill every few months and he pays them by cheque			1
he ’s done this for 17 years with the same local business			0
’ the controversy began on sunday when the question of what constitutes tax avoidance was discussed during a @entity139 interview			0

’ on sunday @entity3 said he always asked for a receipt because it was the ‘ right thing to do ’			2
but he and his wife @entity24 were among mps criticised when the parliamentary expenses scandal erupted in 2009			0
between 2005 and 2007 they ‘ flipped ’ their second home designation to three different properties – including their @entity161 home and a constituency property in @entity6 , @entity23			2
the @entity161 home ... and the constituency home under the old expenses system , mps could designate either a @entity161 home or a constituency property as their second home			0
they could then change the designation of their second home – nicknamed ‘ flipping ’ – and increase the amount they could claim for mortgage interest payments			0
together they claimed a total of £ 24,400 on their second - home allowance			0
a @entity178 mp said it was wrong for them to claim the @entity161 property as their second home when they spent most of their time there , but they were cleared by the standards commissioner in 2008 .			0
