wipe - clean plastic bank notes earmarked to replace paper cash are a ' breeding ground ' for superbugs , scientists claim			2
more durable than the cotton currently used for £ 5 - £ 50 notes , polymer provides a welcome home for diseases such as @entity10 and the @entity12 superbug			1
the findings completely contradict @entity14 claims that hygiene lies at the core of their proposal			1
a team of scientists claim polymer holds bacteria for 24 hours and is easily rubs off on human hands in a bombshell study on currency and bacteria , @entity27 and @entity28 scientists lathered seven currencies with bacteria including the euro , @entity33 dollar , @entity35 kuna , and @entity37 's polymer leu			1
while the euro proved the cleanest - with no sign of passing bacteria - polymer leu notes held traces of @entity12 for up to 24 hours , 21 hours longer than any other currency			1
dr @entity42 , who led the research at the @entity44 and @entity45 in @entity46 , told the @entity47 : ' banknotes containing plastic substances are more likely to carry and transmit bugs			1
' we never become ill just taking bugs from banknotes			1
but we should take into account that we can be contaminated and we should clean our hands after touching them and other probable contaminated material			2
' team member @entity58 , of @entity59 in the @entity28 , said : ' i was amazed to see that some currencies act like breeding grounds for bacteria while others seem to be auto - sterilised			1
' going ahead with a two - month consultation to gauge public opinion , the @entity14 is undeterred by the research			1
the @entity14 is determined to continue with their two - month roadshow around the @entity69 a spokesman told @entity71 is enthusiastic about the project , but refused to comment on dr @entity42 's study			1
he said : ' polymer banknotes are cleaner , more secure and durable than paper notes			1
they are also cheaper and more environmentally friendly			2
' they will last longer , if you spill something on it you can wipe it clean , and they fee so much smoother			2
' they can even go for a wash cycle if you leave one in your pocket			0
' we still need to see exactly what people think of it , which we will do on the roadshows			0
but essentially they are much cleaner			0
' the @entity14 claims the smaller polymer notes wipe clean and could even survive the washing machine			1
the new notes last for more than twice as long , stay cleaner as they are resistant to dirt and moisture and are almost impossible to tear			0
the move will save the bank more than £ 100million over a ten - year period because of the new banknote ’s improved durability			0
a typical £ 5 note currently lasts for two years			0
the new ones would last for just under six years , it was announced yesterday			0
in a two - month consultation , representatives of the @entity14 will take model versions to shopping centres around the country to gauge the public 's verdict before a final decision is made in december			1
if they feedback is overwhelmingly negative , they will scrap the plans			0
if successful , the first £ 5 , featuring @entity121 's face , would be rolled out in 2016			0
the new notes will be slightly smaller than the current note - currently 135mm by 70mm , the new £ 5 will measure just 125mm by 65mm			0
but they will continue to maintain ‘ tiered - sizing ’ – meaning that the higher the denomination , the bigger the note will be			0
@entity14 chief @entity128 is enthusiastic about the polymer notes , already used in his native @entity130 the @entity14 has tested the polymer notes in a 90 - degree washing cycle which seemed to have only ‘ a minimal effect ’ , unlike the current notes which can be ‘ substantially degraded ’			1
they then ‘ submerged them in liquids , including red wine , ’ and found they could be wiped clean , unlike a normal note which stains or disintegrates			2
polymer notes are already used in more than 20 countries , including @entity143 , @entity144 , @entity145 , @entity146 and @entity147 as well as in @entity130			2
question remain unanswered over how cash machines will work with the new cash			0
but a spokesman for @entity152 , the company which is behind 66,000 of @entity69 ’s atms , said : ‘ the atm industry will work closely with the bank to ensure their effective introduction			0
’ the public consultation on the introduction of the new notes is due to finish on 15 november and a final decision will be announced in december .			0

polymer ' more likely to carry and transmit bugs ' according to study
*experts* in @entity27 and @entity28 research team found @entity12 superbug sticks to polymer for 21 hours longer than any other currency
@entity14 refused to comment on the findings
