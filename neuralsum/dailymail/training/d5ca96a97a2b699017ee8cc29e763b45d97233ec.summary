just for kids ? @entity1 and her daughter @entity2 , in april 2011 pity the friends and family of @entity1			0
not only do they get a choice of one lump or two when they visit her house for tea , they also get a choice of milks — soy , skimmed or the bikini model ’s own			0
‘ come on , it ’s normal ’ , announced @entity1 , 35 , who has breastfed both her young daughters @entity17 , aged five , and hero , two			0
‘ i made everyone try mine			0
it tastes just like those probiotic yoghurt drinks			0
@entity24 — not as sweet as condensed milk			2
’ while most people would raise their eyebrows at the suggestion that stirring their host ’s breast milk into their tea is ‘ normal ’ , @entity1 ’s comments have highlighted how , in some quarters , breast milk is no longer considered just for infants			1
there is , of course , the inevitable ‘ yuck ’ factor about the idea of drinking a bodily fluid that does not come pasteurised in a carton , like cow ’s milk			2
not to mention the feeling that turning a mother ’s milk into just another food commodity cheapens and dishonours it , betraying the unique bond between the parent and her child			2
but the unique combination of antibodies , living cells , enzymes , hormones and fatty acids in human breast milk has persuaded some enthusiasts that it is a superfood we just ca n’t afford to ignore			1
because , cringe - inducing as it might be , a growing number of adults are drinking breast milk , convinced that the health - giving benefits it provides infants with could prove an elixir of life for grown - ups , too			1
in the @entity72 its health - giving properties are taken so seriously that patients with cancer , digestive disorders or immune problems can obtain breast milk on prescription from a milk bank			1
all over the world , studies are being carried out to see how it can help with more advanced illnesses			0
in @entity85 , scientists use it to source stem cells to help in the possible treatment of diabetes and parkinson ’s disease			0
meanwhile , in @entity92 , components are being cultivated as possible ‘ brain nutrients ’ to boost mental function in cases of dementia , stroke or brain injury			0
there are also trials underway in @entity101 for a breast milk - based acne cream			1
but while studies are looking to isolate some of breast milk ’s amazing properties , there is growing concern about the unregulated market that is growing up around it on the internet			1
since the first website offering breast milk for sale started in 2010 , the trade has steadily grown , with thousands of pounds worth of unchecked samples now bought and sold every day			1
bikini model @entity1 said breast milk tastes like ' a probiotic yoghurt drink ' in @entity121 , there are 17 officially accredited @entity123 milk banks , to which lactating women can make donations to help mothers unable to produce milk of their own			1
but rather than give away milk for free , many mothers are using community forums , including @entity131 , to make some quick cash			2
a quick glance at one @entity121 - based website shows dozens of women , from @entity136 to @entity137 , willing to sell breast milk — fresh or frozen — for around £ 6 for 200ml			1
supplies are not just bought by mothers who are unable to breast - feed , or who want to return to work and are no longer able to commit to the gruelling schedule breastfeeding demands			2
there is also demand from women and men who claim it will help combat medical conditions , as well as fans of a dubious culinary trend for using breast milk in products like cheeses and ice creams			1
the women who sell their milk online are mothers like @entity160 , 21 , from @entity161 , who last year sold supplies to make extra money while on maternity leave from her admin job and looking after her baby			2
‘ i had one call from a lady who wanted my breast milk for her husband , who she said was suffering from multiple sclerosis , ’ says @entity160			1
‘ apparently , the nutrients and antibodies in breast milk can help people with @entity177 , but just the thought of it made me feel a bit queasy , so i said no. ’ but while some people see it as a panacea to all ills , there is also a risk of infection			1
in samples donated to milk banks in the @entity72 , one study found 3.3 per cent of donors had samples rejected after their blood tests showed up syphilis , @entity196 and hepatitis b and @entity198 , director of a @entity72 milk bank , warns : ‘ women are convinced that breast milk is somehow different from blood , and that there are n’t any risks in sharing it with another woman ’s baby			1
in the @entity72 the health - giving properties of breast milk are taken so seriously that patients with cancer , digestive disorders or immune problems can obtain breast milk on prescription from a milk bank ‘ but it ’s an incredibly risky practice			1
breast milk is a body fluid			1
would you consider cutting open a vein and giving a direct transfusion ? ’ disturbingly , websites trading in breast milk make no provision for screening of donations			1
experts at @entity230 say that it ’s particularly important that samples are screened for anyone who is tempted to take breast milk in an effort to repair their immune system after chemotherapy			1
a spokesman said it would be ‘ crucial to make sure it was tested for any viruses ’			2
quite separately , breast milk has also become the latest trendy ingredient in the continuing search for increasingly outré foods			1
the internet is overflowing with recipes for everything from breast milk crepes to rice pudding			1
businesses selling breast milk products include a trendy @entity255 ice cream emporium , the @entity256 , which recently launched ‘ @entity258 ’ ice - cream — a dessert made from human breast milk , mixed with vanilla and lemon , then frozen and served in a martini glass with a rusk			1
it was briefly banned by @entity266 because of health concerns , but has now been reinstated			2
child development expert dr @entity268 of the @entity269 doubts that products made with human milk have much benefit for healthy adults , other than novelty value			2
she says : ‘ human milk has been honed over thousands of years to provide babies with optimum nutrition			0
it also contains antibodies and human growth hormones , which babies need in order to support their immune system and promote their best growth			0
breast milk has also become the latest trendy ingredient in the continuing search for increasingly outré foods ‘ however , ice cream and certainly cheese production involves processing the milk , so it ’s unclear if it will still retain the properties in fresh breast milk			1
in any event , adults will not specifically “ need ” the ingredients found in breast milk as they have got mature immune systems			1
’ breastfeeding expert @entity299 , founder of milkmatters.org.uk , believes that a lot of our squeamishness over adults drinking breast milk simply derives from the idea breaking cultural norms			1
‘ most of us in the @entity121 are happy to drink cow ’s milk — from a random muddy cow in a field , but not the same species , which is a bit odd			0
yet some @entity315 cultures find our mass consumption of dairy products , like cow ’s milk and cream , icky			0
‘ i am more concerned that women selling breast milk for profit could result in fewer voluntary donations to the @entity123			1
premature babies who could otherwise be saved with it , may have to go without			0
’ retired midwife and breast - feeding specialist @entity326 , author of what to expect when you ’re @entity331 , says it ’s disturbing that breast milk is no longer respected and reserved for its natural purpose			1
in addition , she worries that the breast milk trade is fuelling the idea that all healthy women are overflowing with milk , and that there is something wrong with those who are not			2
trendy @entity255 ice cream emporium , the @entity256 , recently launched @entity344 ¿ ice - cream ¿ a dessert made from human breast milk , mixed with vanilla and lemon , then frozen and served in a martini glass with a rusk ‘ lots of mothers hardly have enough milk to feed their babies as it is , let alone to sell online , ’ says @entity326			1
‘ just like prize dairy cows , some women are genetically blessed with that ability			0
others can only produce small amounts			0
selling your milk online is a way for some women to boast that they ’re good at something other mothers struggle with			2
there is a lot of competitiveness out there			0
’ @entity326 believes the mass market in human milk also distracts from the real issue : that not enough women are breastfeeding in the first place			2
‘ in this country , 65 per cent of babies are bottle - fed by the time they are six weeks old			0
twenty per cent of women never try , ’ she says			0
furthermore , by diverting breast milk from the very infants it is meant for , we could also be interrupting the bonding process			2
after all , the simple act of a mother breastfeeding her child not only gives her child the healthiest start in life , the release of the hormone oxytocin in the mother ’s body also creates a bond between them — something that should surely be sacrosanct			0
indeed , across civilisations and throughout history , breastfeeding has been considered to be the most intimate of acts ; one which many mothers find deeply moving and personal			0
as @entity326 says : ‘ let ’s not forget that breast milk is , first and foremost , for babies			2
it ’s a shame to commercialise something so precious and important in our children ’s lives			0
’ the story of the @entity413 may be familiar to churchgoers the world over			0
but it does n’t usually involve an anteater			0
this rare biological phenomenon is the talk of the town in @entity421 , where a female anteater called @entity423 has given birth despite not having mated for 18 months			0
as the anteater ’s gestation period is just six months , staff at the @entity428 were initially baffled by the arrival , thinking it something of a miracle			0
they have since discovered that @entity423 had an ‘ embryonic diapause ’ whereby an egg fertilised during her mating period was put ‘ on hold ’ in her uterus			0
fortunately , the infant anteater @entity440 has suffered no ill effects for his time in storage .			0

some believe it is a superfood we just ca *n't* afford to ignore
patients with health problems in @entity72 can obtain it from milk banks
but concern growing for growing market of breast milk sold online
unchecked samples can contain viruses
