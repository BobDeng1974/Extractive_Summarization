the study 's lead researcher said the results are a ' surprise ' , but it 's no excuse to pile on the pounds for years we have been told that the first step to staying healthy is to keep to a healthy weight - that means making sure your @entity9 is within the normal range of 18 to 24			1
few people are advised to gain weight , unless their @entity9 is below 18 , but could that change ? a study published last week suggests that overweight people are less likely to develop dementia			1
the researchers , drawn mostly from the @entity19 , analysed the medical records of nearly two million people for up to ten years and found that those who were overweight ( with a @entity9 of 25 to 29 ) had an 18 per cent lower risk of dementia compared to those with a healthy @entity9			1
remarkably the obese ( with a @entity9 of 30 plus ) did even better ; they were 24 per cent less likely to develop dementia			1
being underweight increased the dementia risk by 39 per cent			1
dr @entity27 , a clinical epidemiologist and the lead researcher , called the results a ' surprise ' , but said it was no excuse to pile on the pounds : ' this is a robust and reliable study that opens up an avenue in the search for factors that protect against @entity39 's			2
' but these results are not that extraordinary			0
three years ago , an even larger study , published in the @entity41 , reported that overweight people tended to live longer than those of normal weight			1
the study analysed 100 trials involving three million people			2
it found that being overweight ( a @entity9 between 25 and 29 ) reduced the risk of premature death by six per cent compared with someone of a normal @entity9			1
more surprising was that even if someone was at the lower end of obese ( @entity9 of 30 to 34.5 ) their risk of premature death did n't go up			1
being obese started to reduce lifespan only when your @entity9 went above 35 - here the risk of dying earlier climbed to 29 per cent greater than those with a normal @entity9 , according to the study , headed by dr @entity60 , of the @entity62 government @entity61			1
so could being cuddly fat , rather than hugely overweight , protect you against dying early ? being overweight ( a @entity9 between 25 and 29 ) reduced the risk of premature death by six per cent professor @entity64 , a gp and chairman of the @entity67 , says something called the obesity paradox is at work : ' obesity increases your chances of developing disorders such as heart disease and type 2 diabetes but once you 've fallen ill , being a bit overweight seems to have a protective effect			1
' the obesity paradox had been called ' surreal and unsettling ' , but it does seem to be real			0
we need to understand it			0
' @entity81 , a gp and author with an interest in obesity , claimed in his recent book @entity85 that being overweight was beneficial			2
he is suspicious of the word ' paradox ' when used with a medical hypothesis : ' it is usually a way of describing something that contradicts your theory			0
for instance , people who believe high cholesterol causes heart disease use the phrase ' cholesterol paradox ' to explain why countries with high levels of cholesterol have low levels of heart disease			2
they should admit their theory is wrong			0
' he says that what counts as a normal or ' healthy ' @entity9 has been miscalculated : ' it would make sense if normal was what is now called overweight			1
' millions would then not be pushed into losing weight when they did not need to or when it might be harmful			0
the number of @entity115 who go on a diet in any given year these ' paradoxical ' results suggest that @entity9 is too crude a tool on its own to make decisions about what a healthy weight is			2
it can misclassify athletes packed with muscle as overweight or even obese			2
equally , current @entity9 categories give the wrong picture for what might be called the ' fit fat ' ; people who may have a lot of fat but also eat well and exercise regularly			1
their @entity9 may classify them as obese , but other markers ( blood sugar , fat levels in their blood and blood pressure ) can all be in the super healthy range			1
apparently healthy - weight people with little muscle mass because they rarely exercise also make @entity9 an unreliable indicator of health because rather than storing their fat under the skin , they may carry it in their abdomen , wrapped around their organs and pumping out chemical messengers and hormones linked to diabetes , heart disease and cancer			1
a tape measure is said to be one way to spot if you have this dangerous fat , but leading obesity expert professor @entity156 , chair in obesity research and management at the @entity160 , disagrees : ' a tape measure still wo n't tell you whether your stomach fat is unhealthy			0
symptoms such as hypertension , diabetes or sleep apnoea are far more informative			0
' current @entity9 categories give the wrong picture for what might be called the ' fit fat ' all this suggests it is not a good idea to advise someone to lose weight just on their @entity9			1
professor @entity64 says : ' i 'd never do that ; i 'd need to know about their diet , how much they exercise , what their blood pressure and blood glucose levels were			0
' he welcomes the latest @entity39 and obesity research because it should make people more aware of the complexities of the fat debate : ' we 've got too stuck in the idea that when it comes to weight , one size fits all			2
' why fatter people should be better protected from @entity39 's is guesswork , but evidence suggests having more fat reserves when you fall ill is associated with better recovery			1
' heavier people have better survival rates , ' says dr @entity60			0
' if you get pneumonia and lose 15 lb , it helps to have 15 lb spare '			0
fat is a vital source of the energy needed for recovery and also helps the immune system			2
professor @entity64 says : ' those who are elderly or suffering from long - term conditions should be advised to become fitter , but not to lose weight			0
' one of dr @entity60 's fiercest critics is professor @entity217 , chair of nutrition at @entity219			0
he , too , is concerned that @entity9 does not provide the whole picture of someone 's health but has described dr @entity60 's research as ' rubbish '			2
he is particularly worried her claims could ' undermine public policies to curb rising obesity rates '			0
he says they could be ' hijacked by special interest groups such as soft drink manufacturers and food lobbies '			0
there is no doubt that being obese , and to a lesser extent overweight , is linked to a raised risk of cancers , diabetes , and other chronic disorders			1
while you might not die prematurely , at the very least you are likely to have a poor quality of life ; diabetes complications can include blindness , ulcers and amputations			0
nonetheless professor @entity64 believes the new findings can not be ignored : ' we need to use them to improve the advice and support we give to patients			0
it 's not right to try to discredit them for political reasons			0

a study suggests overweight people are less likely to develop dementia
those who had a @entity9 of 25 to 29 had an 18 per cent lower risk
having more fat when you fall ill is associated with better recovery
remarkably the obese ( with a @entity9 of 30 plus ) did even better
