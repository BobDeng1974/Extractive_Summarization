by @entity0 the mystery of how life flourished on @entity3 could soon be solved by rocks on the moon , according to scientists			1
a team of physicists have simulated the conditions of chunks of rock smashing into the moon to discover whether any microscopic fossils could survive			1
they say that just one finding on the lunar surface could offer experts a glimpse of how ancient life on our own planet formed			1
the truth is out there : finding fossilised algae from @entity3 on the lunar surface , which travelled there by meteorite , ( illustrated ) could offer scientists a glimpse of ancient life on our planet - and some experts believe it may be possible to find such evidence with a lot of searching a number of meteorites discovered on @entity3 were created by impacts on the moon and @entity40 , and suggest that cosmic bodies regularly throw rock debris at each other			1
with this in mind , scientists wanted to test whether similar fossils could be discovered intact on the satellite			0
professor @entity50 from the @entity51 led the experiment to examine whether microscopic diatoms - a type of algae - could withstand a trip from @entity3 to the moon , @entity49 reported			1
powdered rock containing fossils was added to water and then frozen to make an artificial meteoroid			0
scientists then used a gas - powered gun to fire it into a water at speeds of 500 metres per second and 5km a second , replicating the impact of a body of rock hurtling through space before hitting the moon , according to the study , which was published in the journal , @entity75 @entity50 , of the @entity51 , has led an experiment to examine of microscopic diatoms could withstand a trip to the moon from @entity3 and thinks that they could			1
raw diatoms are pictured ( a and b ) , fossilised versions that were shot ( c and d ) and fossilized versions without the impact ( e and f ) while none of the fossils in the homemade meteoroid survived the impact in one piece , reserahcers did find that some tiny fragments of the fossils were identifiable			0
this , they say , could mean minute fossil remains may lay hidden on the moon inside meteorites			0
professor @entity50 told the publication that the fact they found anything at all is promising and that he hopes fragments on the moon may be better preserved than those on @entity3 , as the satellite is less geologically active			2
he said : ' there is a good chance even if you found fragments , there would be things you have not seen before			0
he added that if these fragments could be dated , they would offer information about early life on @entity3			2
however , while rock samples have been collected by lunar missions , no - one has found an @entity3 meteorite on the moon			1
it would be harder for a chunk of rock to travel from @entity3 to the moon because of our planet ’s dense atmosphere and high gravity , but ‘ not impossible ’ , according to @entity134 , of the @entity135			1
scientists think there is a change of finding rock on the moon that contains fossils and @entity141 at the @entity142 said that discovering them would be amazing and ' we should hurry back to the moon '			1
an image of the @entity3 taken from the moon is pictured this is an illustration of the two asteroids colliding between @entity149 and @entity40 470 years ago scientists are currently examining a meteorite found in a quarry in @entity153 to unravel why @entity3 thrived in the @entity155 period , 470 million years ago			1
the fossilised space rock is thought to be the remains of one of two asteroids that crashed between @entity149 and @entity40 , the debris of which later bombarded @entity3 and kick started the variation of life			2
while other space rocks have been found at the site , this one could prove to be the ' missing link ' and could reveal more about the evolution of life on @entity3			2
it is thought that the meteorite is one of many that bombarded our planet over 500 million years ago , when a small asteroid crashed into a larger one between @entity149 and @entity40			0
this impact resulted in the creation of many fragments that eventually bombarded @entity3 470 million years ago			2
these fragments are known as l chrondrites , and they are the second most common type of meteorite on the planet			0
it 's believed these impacts may have kick started the resurgence of biodiversity on @entity3 , when life became more varied and complex			0
this occurred during the @entity155 period , prior to which biodiversity had gone through a lull			0
however , while the meteorites are thought to be the remains of the larger asteroid , scientists had been puzzled as to why there was no sign of the smaller asteroid			0
now they think the sample in @entity153 could belong to smaller rock , adding weight to the scientific theory .			0

physicists at the @entity51 simulated whether it is possible for fossils to survive the impact of hitting the moon
they made their own meteoroids and fired them into *war* with a gun , to replicate a powerful impact on the lunar surface
they are hopeful that they could and that just one finding of fossils from @entity3 on the moon could offer a glimpse of ancient life on our planet
many rock samples have been collected from the moon , by no fossils from @entity3 have been found so far
scientists have said it is ' not impossible ' that the evidence is there on the moon and one has called for further *exploration*
