and they have two dogs too			0
’ it was a lot to take in			0
' speaking about @entity9 's kids , @entity12 declared : ' all he did was make them a bunch of money , but it was n’t even about the money			1
it was the custody battle and the mother being controlling			0
” while @entity12 says she thinks a reconciliation will happen between kit and at least some of his children , she is certain the last person to make up with his father will be @entity1			1
' @entity1 would be the last to reconcile with him , ' she said			2
@entity1 was managed by his parents from the start of his career when he was just four until 1995 when they split and he ' retired ' , aged 14			1
longtime love : @entity9 and his partner of 20 years @entity25 family man : @entity9 - seen with a young @entity1 - is estranged from all of his children by that time he had earned an estimated $ 50 million , which had largely been put into a trust fund , with 15 per cent paid to his managers			1
a huge legal battle between @entity9 and @entity124 ensued over both custody of @entity1 and his fortune , which ended up with him ‘ divorcing ’ his parents			1
after the bitter fight was over @entity9 , a highly charged character , appeared to accept defeat			2
while @entity124 and his children stayed in @entity183 , he retreated to the @entity184 and started over again with @entity25 , who he had known since the 1970s			1
a former actor himself , @entity9 let his once dark hair go grey and long and complemented it with a large beard as he settled into small town life in @entity75 , thousands of miles away from the bright spotlights and fast pace of @entity183			2
@entity12 claims that @entity9 - known in the 1990s for his hard - nosed business tactics - is in fact , now humble , and quickly dismisses the question of whether his family helped with medical bills , saying : ' he ’s not had a penny from his family , ever			1
he and @entity25 are retired so they ’re on social security , and that ’s it			2
they live like normal people			0
father 's footsteps : @entity9 ( left ) was an actor and his son took after him on stage : @entity9 ( far right ) attends @entity212 's 32nd birthday party in 1962 with the @entity214 cast @entity12 claims that one of the most heart - breaking things for @entity9 , who has made a good recovery , is not being in contact with his daughter , @entity87 , following the death of his other daughter @entity223 after she was struck by a car in 2008			1
she said : ' i know he really wants to speak to his daughter			0
he was heartbroken over @entity223			0
' she added the warning : ' family is everything and he ’s not going to be around forever			0
they ’ll regret it when it ’s too late			0
' when asked if @entity9 would appreciate @entity1 ’s joke band , @entity115 , @entity12 thinks it unlikely , although she ‘ likes ’ the group herself on @entity237 and finds them funny			1
she says she would even consider approaching @entity1 at one of his shows in an attempt to reunite him with his father			0
she said : ' the band , it was kinda funny and kind of stupid , maybe there ’s a reason he did that , i do n’t know			0
i would go and see them			0
i would probably introduce myself to him			0
maybe i could persuade him [ to get in contact with kit ] , but i doubt it			0
modest : @entity25 's @entity75 home			2
she has been by @entity9 's side for the past 20 years ' kit would n’t want to see them , he would n’t like that type of music			1
he does n’t even like it when i put my music on in the car			0
' admitting she may face the ire of the fiercely private @entity1 family for speaking out , @entity12 said she did not care as she was one of the few people to care for kit			1
after a few months of recuperation , kit left to stay with his sister , die hard actress @entity267 , 66 , in @entity268 on his own , but @entity25 ' “ could n’t handle being apart ' from him so they rented a small house close to @entity267 ’s so she could look after them and take them to medical appointments			1
@entity12 added : ' kit is 95 per cent better			2
he ’s able to talk for the most part now			0
he can drive again and he can cook , which he loves to do			0
famous : @entity1 remains most famous for his childhood role in @entity2 in 1990 spirited : @entity1 fights off @entity279 in @entity2 ' @entity280 is wonderful , she ’s really been a big help with him , doing therapy and getting him hooked up with doctors , him and @entity25			1
' i have the best relationship with them , @entity9 is basically my stepdad			0
they ’ve always been really nice to me , that ’s why i ’ve never understood all the things people have said about @entity9 , he ’s just a wonderful , kind , generous guy			0
' kit ’s recovery means he is now able to continue caring for @entity25 and they are hoping to return to normal life in @entity75			2
it has also given his family another chance to make amends and hopefully this @entity55 he can have more of a connection to his most successful son than simply seeing him as he was 24 years ago in @entity2 .			2
