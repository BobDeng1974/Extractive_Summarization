a pet refuge in @entity1 has said it wants to adopt @entity2 , the dog whose owner willed him to be put down after her death			1
but @entity8 's cousin , the executor of the estate , has n't decided to spare the @entity12 shepherd 's life , @entity6 reports			2
in the meantime , volunteers and workers at the @entity15 have fallen in love with @entity2 - but are powerless to save him if @entity8 's cousin decides he should die			1
cruel fate : @entity2 is due to be euthanized after his owner stipulated that he should be with her for eternity after her death last month when ms @entity8 died at her home in @entity26 , @entity27 , she stipulated in her will that @entity2 should be given to her cousin , who is the executor of her estate			1
if the cousin did n't want to take him , then he should be sent to the @entity32 in southern @entity1			0
ms @entity8 's cousin has no interest in keeping @entity2 , @entity34 , the attorney in charge of the will , told the @entity37			1
and ms @entity8 neither contacted @entity32 refuge nor did she set aside money to send her pet to the shelter			2
so now @entity2 is in danger of falling victim to the final provision of ms @entity8 's will - that he be euthanized and cremated and his ashes mixed with ms @entity8 's			1
the @entity32 issued a statement to @entity6 on tuesday saying : ' we want to save @entity2 's life and bring him to our sanctuary , but the decision to send him to us or have him put down and cremated is out of our hands			2
@entity2 is currently being boarded at the @entity15 while he awaits his fate			2
several families have offered to adopt him ' the decision needs to be made by the person designated in ms. @entity57 's will and we are hopeful that she will agree			0
please be patient as we educate her about @entity32 life - saving mission and demonstrate that @entity2 will be in good hands			0
' ms @entity8 's cousin still has n't decided to send @entity2 to the shelter			1
hundreds of people have tweeted out with the hashtag # savebela since the story of his plight went public			0
dozens of families have offered to adopt the pooch			0
however mr @entity34 , ms @entity8 's lawyer , says only the executor of her estate has authority to decide his fate			1
' the dog was owned by my client and now it ’s part of her estate , ' @entity34 told @entity77			0
' and those are her wishes , as far as the future of the dog is concerned			0
outsiders do n’t have the grounds to rewrite the provisions of my client ’s will and impose what they want			0
' under @entity27 law , pets and other animals are considered property			1
owners must treat them humanely , but otherwise get allowed to decide whether they live or die			1
@entity8 died on november 25 - but before her death she made arrangements with her lawyer and a close friend to ' dispose ' of all her property - including @entity2			1
mr @entity34 told @entity77 that the dog is aggressive and that ms @entity8 kept a record of his aggressive behavior before she died			2
when she passed away at her home , @entity2 fiercely guarded her body and would not let anyone enter the house			0
however , volunteers who have worked with @entity2 since he was taken to the shelter say that he has n't shown signs of being overly aggressive , according to @entity6 .			0

@entity8 died on november 25 and stipulated in her will that her dog @entity2 be euthanized , cremated and his remains mixed with hers
her lawyer says he is *upholding* the conditions of her will and that no one can *disrupt* her dying wishes
animals are considered property under @entity27 law and owners can decide whether they live or die
