@entity1 teenager @entity0 sensationally has turned his back on @entity3 – earning a sharp rebuke from the man whose rule change fast - tracked the former @entity8 striker into the international game			1
@entity10 kid @entity0 has been tipped for the top and , having featured for @entity3 at @entity12 and under - 21 level , was to be a key player in the @entity16 under - 19 elite round qualifiers starting in @entity17 tomorrow			1
but the 18 - year - old , who has n’t featured for his adopted nation since a 6 - 0 hammering by @entity22 in @entity23 last august , withdrew with a mystery injury – despite starring in last week ’s @entity25 win over @entity27 at @entity28			1
snub : @entity10 teenager @entity0 has turned his back on playing for @entity3 hope : many behind the scenes believed that he could take @entity33 football by storm the @entity35 have repeatedly pleaded with @entity0 , whose family arrived in @entity37 via @entity38 as refugees when he was just 10 , to turn up to squad after squad – but he has made it clear that he ’s not interested			1
his decision to quit @entity3 will come as no surprise to anyone at @entity8 , with @entity0 ’s departure to @entity10 in 2011 still a source of some rancour – especially as the late @entity49 had spoken on behalf of the @entity0 family when they were threatened with deportation			1
and the man whose foresight allowed @entity0 into the @entity33 international set - up believes the forward has been guilty of an equally poor attitude by ditching his adopted nation			2
as @entity35 chief executive , @entity59 pushed through a change allowing youngsters who had gone through a country ’s education system to represent their adopted nation			1
@entity59 told @entity66 that he was saddened – but not surprised – to learn of @entity0 ’s decision , saying : ‘ he is a real talent , of that there is no doubt			1
there ’s a reason he was capped at age groups several steps beyond his actual years – he is a great talent			0
‘ but i felt his attitude was wrong when he left @entity8 , to be honest			0
@entity8 did a lot for him , helped his family , helped him enormously			2
‘ i felt it was a slap in the face , leaving @entity8 the way he did and throwing in his lot with @entity10			2
i was personally disappointed with that , because i thought he should have shown more loyalty			0
‘ with that in mind , i ’m not really surprised that he ’s done the same thing to @entity3 – although i find it hard to understand why he ’s done it			2
dejected : @entity35 chief @entity59 changed the rules to allow @entity0 to play for @entity3 in the first place composed : @entity0 had been likened in some quarters to @entity96 legend @entity95 under - 16 : 3 caps ; 1 @entity98 : 18 caps ; 7 @entity100 - 19 : 5 caps ; 3 @entity100 - 20 : 1 cap ; 0 @entity100 - 21 : 4 caps ; 2 goals ‘ just like @entity8 did a lot for him , @entity3 did a great deal for him and his family			1
on a football level , we gave him an opportunity to express himself in international football , getting great experience and benefiting his career prospects enormously			2
' you ca n’t tell me it did n’t help him			0
on top of that , his family came to @entity3 as refugees and were treated well			1
‘ if he does n’t want to play for @entity3 , well , you just have to accept it			1
the one thing you need at international level is motivation on the part of the individual			0
‘ people have to be fired up and want to play for their country , to feel pride in the jersey – to feel like they belong to the country and have a stake in its success			0
‘ if you ’ve got someone - like @entity0 – who does n’t want to play for @entity3 , the only option is to reject him immediately			1
if he can not commit to playing for this country , we should n’t have anything to do with him			0
‘ i do n’t know what he is thinking now because , under the rules , he can not play for any other @entity141 , so it ’s not as if he can play for @entity17			2
’ @entity59 said that @entity0 was never the driving force for the rule change , insisting : ‘ his name was put forward when the rules were being changed – him and @entity147 at @entity148			1
‘ but the rules were n’t changed for the benefit of any particular player , people just mentioned both of these guys as potential early beneficiaries of any change			2
‘ i had nobody in mind at all			0
we just took the decision , the four @entity141 , that we would not comply with the rules making it easy to change nationalities just like that			0
‘ were collectively keen to stick to the restrictions on eligibility – parents , grandparents or being born in the country			0
‘ but i felt that it would be only fair to a kid whose family had settled here that they should be allowed to play for @entity3			1
if they had gone through the education system because they ’d emigrated here , and if they held a @entity179 passport , i thought we should be free to consider them			0
‘ so i put the new rule together and put it before the three other @entity141 , who agreed , then we got it past @entity183			0
’ mover : the teenager moved from @entity8 to @entity10 in 2012 bright spark : and starred during @entity10 's @entity25 win over @entity27 capped for the under - 17s at the age of 14 and @entity3 ’s youngest ever under - 21 cap while just 16 , @entity0 was likened to a young @entity95 by @entity35 performance director @entity191			1
instead of turning out for @entity193 ’s young squad in qualifiers against @entity17 , @entity195 and @entity196 , he will be in @entity197 to represent @entity10 at @entity198			2
@entity35 chiefs insist the door is still open for @entity0 if he changes his mind and @entity193 is refusing to rule out a return for him - or @entity204 ’s @entity203 - 19 stars @entity205 and @entity207 , who were previously approached to play for @entity3			1
he said : ‘ the doors are never closed			0
i can understand @entity205 and @entity209 because they are @entity211 - born players			0
‘ i spoke to them and i ’ll speak to them when we see them down there , but the door is always open to them			0
we never close the door and that ’s the same with everybody			0

@entity0 had played at almost every youth level for @entity3
@entity35 chief @entity59 changed rules so youngster could play for them
arrived in @entity37 with his family as refugees aged just 10
starred for @entity10 in @entity25 final win over @entity27
