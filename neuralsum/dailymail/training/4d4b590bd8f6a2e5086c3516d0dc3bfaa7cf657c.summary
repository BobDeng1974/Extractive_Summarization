a couple whose car was damaged by a pothole have won a victory over the local council – who lied to avoid paying compensation			1
@entity7 , 59 , drove over the 3ft - wide hole and the collision blew out the tyres on her @entity11			1
when her husband @entity13 , 49 , arrived at the scene , the road was ‘ littered ’ with cars that had hit the hole			0
@entity7 and @entity17 beside the repaired pot hole in @entity19 , after it damaged their car but when they reported the incident to @entity26 in january last year , the authority claimed to have no knowledge of the road defect and refused to pay compensation for the damaged vehicle			1
the couple decided to fight the ruling and are now celebrating victory after a court ordered the council to pay them £ 311			1
@entity36 heard the authority had already been informed of the dangerous pothole , in @entity19 , and had recorded it as a priority case to be fixed within five days			1
the authority had actually been informed of the dangerous pothole but claimed to have no knowledge of it but the repairs were not carried out and council chiefs claimed to have no knowledge of the problem			1
district judge @entity48 told the court : ‘ there are clear problems with the way the council deals with dangerous potholes			1
’ following the year - long legal battle grandfather - of - two mr @entity13 urged other road users to fight councils for compensation			1
the electronics engineer yesterday described the case as ‘ a nightmare ’			0
he said : ‘ when i got to @entity19 i found the road just littered with cars that had hit this hole – you could n’t avoid it			0
' every one had damaged their tyres			0
i called the police in the end because it was obviously dangerous			0
’ the council denied being told of the pothole , but ‘ they clearly had ’ , mr @entity13 said			2
‘ we were told that people had reported it and since it is dangerous they should have fixed it straightaway			0
but they still tried to claim it was n’t a problem			0
they even sent us a group of reports that were obviously for a different hole			0
’ bureaucrats at the council headquarters ( above ) said they had no knowledge of the pothole so could not pay out any compensation the collision blew out both the front and rear tyres on her @entity11 ( stock image ) this is not the first time a council has tried to wriggle out of paying compensation			1
@entity100 damaged his car driving over a pothole , he decided that @entity104 council should foot the repair bill			1
but rather than admit fault , officials said they knew nothing of the hole and said his poor driving must have been to blame			2
they dismissed the 62 - year - old grandfather ’s claim that they should pay the £ 500 bill to fix the wrecked suspension on his @entity116			1
but mr @entity100 used a @entity118 request , he found out that a council worker had reported the 18in by 6in hole during an inspection three months earlier – but the council had ignored it			2
the hole was even recorded as a priority case that should be repaired within 28 days , but it was never fixed			0
but even after mr @entity100 , a retired @entity127 project manager , told @entity104 of his findings , it still refused to pay up – and the disagreement went to the small claims court			0
at a hearing at @entity133 , a judge ruled in favour of mr @entity100 and ordered the council to refund him £ 500 , plus costs of £ 115			1
he added : ‘ they then bombard you with all sorts of documents and hope they will confuse you into just going away			0
‘ it ’s just not acceptable … these potholes are dangerous for any road users			0
a cyclist could be sent flying off their bike and die			0
’ the couple from @entity148 , @entity149 , are calling on councils to change their policies on fixing road defects			0
most authorities promise to repair dangerous potholes within five days of inspection , but before 2010 there was a policy of two - hour or 24 - hour repairs for ‘ critical ’ problems			2
the pair said the pothole in @entity19 was so dangerous it should have been fixed on the same day			2
miss @entity7 , a medical receptionist , told the court : ‘ this defect was , without any doubt , a serious road hazard and should have been repaired immediately following inspection given its size and location			2
’ @entity26 refused to comment			2
the legal victory comes just one month after the @entity170 reported that 62 - year - old @entity100 forced @entity104 to pay £ 615 for his car repairs after he proved they had ignored potholes			1
a council worker had reported the 18in - by - 6in hole that damaged his car three months before the incident but it was not fixed .			1

@entity7 drove over the 3ft - wide hole while driving through @entity180 and the collision blew out both the tyres on her @entity11
@entity26 said as they had no knowledge of the pothole and therefore could not pay out any compensation
but it later *emerged* that they had been informed of the dangerous pothole
@entity36 ordered the council to pay £ 311 in costs
