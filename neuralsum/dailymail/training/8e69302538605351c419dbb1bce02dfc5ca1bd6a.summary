click here to see why @entity1 will make history for @entity3 at the @entity4 going up against the @entity3 is always an exciting challenge — especially when you face guys like @entity8			1
he is a fantastic winger and some people have said he is even better than @entity11			2
but @entity11 will always be the man in my opinion ! @entity8 is an exceptional athlete who gets himself in the right place at the right time			1
he takes his chances very well and pops up where people do n’t want to see him			2
his scoring record speaks for itself but it ’s unfair to compare him to @entity11 , because who knows how good @entity11 could have been with all the facilities we have in the modern game ? the @entity3 squad is oozing quality and @entity8 is just one example			1
@entity28 is a player i love to watch and he ’s shown his quality by switching straight back from rugby league to international rugby union			1
@entity33 can not wait to face @entity3 at the @entity4 on saturday @entity33 ( third right ) and team - mates react after a poor performance against @entity37 in their previous @entity38 then there ’s @entity1 , the face of the @entity3			1
he will captain the side for the 100th time on saturday and that sums up the man … most players do n’t get up to @entity46 , let alone as skipper			1
they do have an aura about them because they are the world ’s best team			1
it ’s the same with any sports team who are at the top of their game			1
we just have to go in with confidence and belief in our own abilities , which is something we all have			2
over the past few games they have shown they ’re human and they do make mistakes			2
i guess what sets them apart is that even when they ’re on the back foot , they still manage to grind out the results			2
hopefully we can push them over the edge			2
on a personal note , i ca n’t wait to face the haka again			1
some people say it gives @entity3 an unfair advantage and should be banned , but it ’s a tradition of the game and i think it should carry on			1
it ’s supposed to be intimidating , but if you ca n’t handle it then you ’re probably not going to be able to manage a game of international rugby either			0
i first faced it in 2010 — it was quite daunting as an 18 - year - old lad but it ’s just part of the game			0
@entity8 has been compared to @entity3 rugby legend @entity11 @entity1 will make history by captaining the @entity3 for a 100th test on saturday @entity95 coach @entity94 ( right ) leads a training session after the ' disappointment ' of the @entity37 win @entity37 had their own war dance last weekend , but the less said about that game the better			1
it was a tough day for everyone involved and we know we did n’t perform well			0
@entity94 was like a disappointed dad in the changing room afterwards			0
it was one of those ‘ i ’m not angry … i ’m disappointed , ’ moments			0
our basic skills were n’t there and we got turned over 22 times			0
that ’s not acceptable in international rugby ; it was schoolboy level and we let ourselves down			0
now we pick ourselves up and get ready to raise our game against the @entity3			1
we had a funny quiz on monday night that was organised by @entity119			0
it was a chance to get all the boys together and have a laugh			0
i was put in a team with @entity125 , @entity126 and @entity127			1
on paper we should have won it but we only managed fourth place			0
the team captained by @entity132 took the trophy in the end			1
i ’m not quite sure how that happened ! @entity136 and @entity137 , the huge @entity139 centre , swapped shirts after the game on saturday			2
@entity136 likes to think he ’s the big man but @entity137 beat him there			0
he was massive ! it ’s safe to say @entity137 ’s shirt might be a bit baggy on the @entity146 ! @entity33 is a massive fan of @entity3 's war dance the haka , performed here against @entity151 @entity136 ( right ) met his match when he swapped shirts with @entity37 's @entity154 ( left ) we ’ve been following the progress of the @entity95 football team in camp			1
they ’re doing really well at the moment — drawing 0 - 0 with @entity161 on sunday — and that ’s good to see			0
i ’m not the biggest football lover but if i had to pick a team then it would probably be @entity167			2
@entity168 and @entity127 are the biggest fans in the squad and i ’m sure they would love it if @entity172 came to visit one day			0
some of the lads have got together to create a cookbook for charity			0
@entity176 tried making ‘ @entity126 ’s @entity177 ’ the other day and the feedback was pretty good			0
i ’m not much of a cook myself but my special recipe is carrot cake			0
we get most of our food provided for us but @entity184 thinks he is a bit of a @entity186			0
really he ’s more of a @entity188 job ! @entity95 players watched @entity172 help his country to a 0 - 0 draw against @entity161 in @entity193 qualifying			1

wales take on @entity3 in @entity196 on saturday
@entity198 @entity33 is looking *forward* to taking on the ' best team in the world ' *including* players @entity8 and @entity28
the @entity95 wing is a massive fan of the @entity3 ' war dance the haka
