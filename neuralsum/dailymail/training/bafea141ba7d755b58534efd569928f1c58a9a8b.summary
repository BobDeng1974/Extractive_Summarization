by @entity0 published : 19:59 est , 22 january 2014 updated : 22:33 est , 22 january 2014 they are a stunning insight into how @entity5 's most iconic products came to be			1
the amazing images show the unique transparent prototypes used by @entity5 's engineers as they worked out how to create the firm 's best known machines - and some of its flops			1
it comes as @entity5 's @entity14 celebrates its 30th birthday			1
it was never made in this format , but this early unit was built especially for @entity21 in a transparent briefcase so he could take it to show customers			1
@entity5 's first @entity14 was introduced by @entity21 on january 24 , 1984 , two days after the @entity25 - directed tv commercial introducing the idea of the @entity14 appeared during the @entity27 between the @entity28 and the @entity30 @entity29			1
the first mass - market personal computer featuring a graphical user interface and mouse , the first version boasted 128k of memory and sold for $ 2,495			2
the brand continues until this day , with @entity5 's @entity39 , @entity40 and @entity41 on sale			2
the amazing prototypes were tracked down by software engineer @entity44 , who spent four years on the project , taking 150,000 photos in total , buying 500 products and persuading collectors to give him access to 50 - 60 prototypes			1
' the project started in 2009 , when i was reminiscing about an old game , @entity52 , ' he told @entity55			2
' i went onto @entity56 to buy it , and then looked for an @entity58 to play it on - and thought it would be cool to see them all in the way @entity5 show them today in their promo photographs			2
' the @entity66 , the fourth model in the @entity58 of personal computers , was @entity70 's first attempt at a portable computer			2
it went on sale in 1984 for $ 1295			0
the finished version of the @entity66 , which was designed to be easily carried around @entity44 then worked with photographers to learn how to take photographs in an ' @entity5 ' style , before beginning his quest to try and photograph every @entity5 machine			1
he said collectors were keen to show off their devices			0
' the underlying theme is that these collectors love their treasures and were more than happy to have them documented for the world to see			0
part of the @entity87 2 , released in 1988 , which was the firm 's first attempt at a touchscreen machine - but flopped the @entity87 , first launched in 1993 for $ 699 the final version of @entity5 's @entity87 ' and of course , they contributed to my own personal quest to photograph every product that @entity5 has ever produced and brought my dream just that little closer to reality ' all the prototypes were really interesting , the whole transparent design was fascinating , ' he said			1
the products include everything from @entity5 's first @entity14 machines to the @entity105 ' it 's first attempt at a handheld tablet - like device			1
the device was a failure , but laid the groundwork for @entity5 to pursue the area , eventually culminating in the @entity113 and @entity114 we know today			0
@entity44 said the prototypes were needed because of the way @entity21 worked			1
' @entity5 worked in a different way to most firms , @entity21 would say i want it to look like this , so they would built these transparent machines and shove the guts into the design - in most other firms it was the other way round			1
' ' a very large number of those machines used these prototypes , and they were so engineers could see where every component was			1
the @entity14 portable , the first battery - powered @entity14 , was released on september 20 , 1989 with a mono screen , and sold for $ 6,500 the finished version of the @entity137 , which weighed 16 pounds ( 7.2 kilograms ) and was 4 inches ( 10 centimetres ) thick			1
the profile was the first hard drive produced by @entity70 in 1983 , initially for use with the @entity5 personal computer			0
the original model had a formatted capacity of 5 mb ' people took them home , many many years ago , and i managed to track them down			1
they do still leak out , but less and less			0
this week sees the 30th anniversary of the @entity14 , @entity5 's most famous computer - and the name which is still in use today in the @entity39 and @entity40 lines			1
' the @entity14 was the machine that brought @entity5 to the fore , @entity14 was so compact , such a different experience , ' said @entity44			1
' the @entity14 brand has stayed all the way through , and it all stems from the @entity14			1
' the @entity157 was a personal digital assistant designed for schools , and was introduced on march 7 , 1997 for us $ 799			0
another image of the @entity157 , @entity5 's educational machine the final design of the @entity157 , which was the first @entity5 design tho keep the translucent look of the company 's prototype devices			0
' i received an email one day on my website from an ex @entity5 engineer telling me how much he loved the site			0
' he included his phone number so i gave him a call and we got to chatting about his history			0
' he started to tell me about a storage locker he has in @entity177 that he had n't opened in 20 years and ' thought he might have some interesting stuff in there '			2
' i hopped on a plane and flew out to meet him and it turned into a scene straight out of ' @entity183 ' - i was rummaging through this massively cluttered storage unit pulling out piece by piece and asking him if he understood how much these things were worth - he literally had no idea			0
' @entity189 , an early @entity5 engineer , also has a large prototype collection and he allowed me to visit him in @entity191 , take all of his machines to my hotel room and photograph for a day , then bring them back			2
' he also got hold of a very rare @entity197 and allowed me to photograph that - as it turns out that @entity14 belongs to @entity199 who is running the 30th anniversary event this weekend ( mac30th.com )			1
' there is another very prolific collector of prototypes over in @entity205 and this guy has a massive collection			0
each of the devices is a top secret internal prototype that staff were - supposedly - not allowed to take outside the office ' he recently quit the software business and decided to become a cop - i went to visit him and showed up in my rental car - we both packed all of his gear into my car and then i turned to him and said ' ok let 's go ' ( i had rented a professional photo studio 10 miles from his office ) and he said ' no that 's ok - i have stuff to do today - i 'll see you later '			0
' i am certain that i would have had hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of rare @entity5 gear and he was happy for me to just drive off with it			2
' finally , there was one item that was being auctioned on @entity56 ( the @entity232 drive ) and it sold for nearly $ 5000			0
' i contacted the winner who was overseas in @entity235 and asked if there was anyway i could photograph it before it left the @entity239 - he agreed to have the seller ship me the drive , photograph it , then ship it across to the seller			0
' it 's quite amazing that he agreed to do that having never met me but he loved the website so much that he wanted to contribute			0
the first version of @entity5 's @entity41 laptop line , which is still on sale today			0
it revealed the components of the laptop from the screen to keyboard			2
another shot of the @entity41 , showing the two halves of the machine the @entity41 keyboard , showing the more recognisable machine coming together the final design of the @entity41 , which thankfully was thinner and lighter than the boxy prototypes .			0

revealed as the @entity14 celebrates its 30th anniversary
transparent machines were built by engineers so they could see where to put *electronics*
@entity44 spent four years tracking down the rare machines for his book iconic
