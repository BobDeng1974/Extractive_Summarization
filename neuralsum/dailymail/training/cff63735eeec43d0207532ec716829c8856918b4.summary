by @entity0 the sound of parents screaming from the touchline has long been a part of children ’s football			2
but last weekend , the din gave way to deafening silence for a campaign against intimidation			2
it was the first brave new step in a bid to stamp out touchline hostility and intimidation that has plagued junior football for years and led many to walk away from the game			1
the @entity17 , planned by @entity18 , saw 1,000 games played in almost total quiet			1
silence : the @entity17 , planned by @entity18 , saw 1,000 games played in almost total silence			1
it was the first brave new step in a bid to stamp out touchline hostility and intimidation that has plagued junior football for years and led many to walk away from the game ‘ it was an incredible thing , ’ said @entity28 , @entity29 welfare officer , whose idea it was			1
‘ @entity33 were the sounds of adults screaming and shouting their advice from the touchline , like a bunch of baying sea lions			1
‘ instead the children were able to play the game without the touchline shouting and pressure that has , frankly , become part of the junior game			2
’ the initiative aims to change the rowdy environment of junior football matches so children have the ability to learn the sport more naturally			0
it aims to stamp out the bullying advice they often receive where one parent is screaming for them pass the ball while another is calling for them to shoot			0
some 2,000 teams from 200 clubs signed up			0
@entity61 , whose 11 - year - old son plays for a team that took part said : ‘ some matches were absolutely ridiculous – the crowd was more like a baying mob and it can be a really intimidating thing to put your children through			1
‘ there was a lot of bullying form the touchline with parents scoffing at children and telling them how they should be playing			0
refreshing : @entity28 , @entity29 welfare officer , came up with the idea after he watched an under - nines match last year and saw how terrified one boy was			1
he said : ' gone were the sounds of adults screaming and shouting their advice from the touchline , like a bunch of baying sea lions			1
it was so refreshing ' ‘ i think the @entity17 was an excellent idea and not before time			0
’ mr @entity28 came up with the idea after he watched an under - nines match last year and saw how terrified one boy was			1
he said : ‘ he was absolutely petrified by the experience			0
all the adults were shouting and baying and it was an intimidating and hostile environment			2
' afterwards his father came over and said : " this is not right			0
" ‘ i agreed with him and immediately set about thinking how we could make the environment less hostile for people just learning the sport			0
' coaches also had to be quiet , although there were concerns about how they would instruct players as a result			0
it is now hoped that other @entity29 bodies could take up the idea			0
but it was n’t only the crowd that was asked to remain quiet during @entity17 , even the coaches had to button their lips			0
mr @entity28 said : ‘ there was some opposition to that and after the matches there were some concerns that coaches were n’t able to coach the players and there were some parents who were frustrated by not being able to offer their encouragement			2
‘ but the aim of the weekend was to show how junior football matches can be marred by the type of hostility and intimidation that have become a norm			1

silent weekend was planned by @entity18
new step to try and stamp out touchline hostility and intimidation
@entity28 came up with the idea after seeing how a nine - year - old was left terrified after shouting and baying from the *sidelines*
