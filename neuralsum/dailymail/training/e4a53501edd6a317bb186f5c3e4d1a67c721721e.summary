more than 110,000 people are living with funeral debt in @entity2 - according to @entity4 mp @entity3 families are burying dead relatives in their gardens because of the rising cost of funerals , a @entity4 mp has claimed			1
@entity3 said some people are being forced to sell possessions or take out pay - day loans to fund a proper send - off			1
others are holding diy funerals or choosing cut - price cremations with no formal service , she claimed			1
according to research , the average cost of a funeral has reached more than £ 3,500 – nearly twice the level a decade ago			1
in some areas , the figure can approach £ 7,000 because of a lack of burial space			2
the mp for @entity27 said one fifth of the 500,000 families bereaved each year struggle to afford the cost of a funeral , with more than 100,000 in the country now owing funeral debts			1
she said the problem will get worse as the price of a service accelerates faster than inflation , with the average cost standing at £ 3,551			1
in some areas of the country the price may approach £ 7,000 due to issues over burial space availability , mps heard			0
she told the @entity46 : ‘ everyone who loses someone close to them wants to give them a decent send - off , but sadly fewer and fewer people are now able to afford even a basic funeral			2
‘ as well as rising debts , we ’re also seeing people turn to alternatives to the traditional funeral			1
' some are holding do - it - yourself funerals and even having to bury their relatives in their back garden			0
‘ a number of companies are offering cut - price funerals including direct cremations that have no formal service			0
’ the @entity4 mp pressed ministers to tackle ‘ funeral poverty ’ by holding a @entity2 - wide review of funeral service costs and to reform a @entity73 social fund designed to help low - income households			1
funeral directors should also be required to let people know the price of a ‘ simple service ’ to make it easier for people to choose an affordable service , the @entity27 mp said			1
home burials are legal in @entity2 if the householder owns the freehold , but estate agents estimate having a body buried on a property can reduce its value by £ 50,000			0
mrs @entity3 , who is calling for a review of funeral poverty , said research by insurer @entity93 estimates that 110,000 are living with funeral debt , with each person owing over £ 1,300 on average			1
the average cost for a cremation funeral is £ 3,163 , including £ 654 for the cremation and £ 2,224 for the funeral director			1
a burial funeral costs on average £ 3,933 , including £ 1,584 for the burial			1
ms @entity3 told the @entity46 : ‘ one woman from my area approached the @entity105 with unmanageable debts			2
funerals are rising in cost leaving many poor families unable to afford them			1
this has caused some people to bury their relatives in their back yard ‘ she had been unable to get the money together to pay for a headstone for her brother 's grave			0
‘ she ended up applying for a payday loan and the cost of repaying this debt had quickly got out of control			2
sadly her story is not an isolated one			0
‘ @entity93 estimates that 110,000 people are living with funeral debt , with each person owing over £ 1,300 on average			1
‘ as well as rising debts , we 're also seeing people turn to alternatives to the traditional funeral			2
‘ some are holding do it yourself funerals and even having to bury their relatives in their back garden			0
‘ a number of companies are offering cut - price funerals including direct cremations that have no formal service attached to them			0
‘ increasingly bereaved individuals who simply can not afford a formal service are faced with having to opt for a public health funeral - or what used to be referred to as pauper 's funerals			2
' ms @entity3 said a review of funeral poverty costs would need to consider the amount of burial space available , how deaths are registered , the impact of competition between private and local authority crematoria , and the support offered via the benefits system to people who can not afford a service			1
addressing state support from the @entity165 ( @entity165 ) for low - income households , the mp said the social fund is ‘ well overdue for reform ’			0
she said : ‘ the system does n't function well at the minute and even encourages some households into debt			0
‘ applications are lengthy and confusing and especially for somebody who is just bereaved			0
they can also take around 17 days to have an outcome			0
‘ @entity165 also requires an invoice to claim , which means that people who want to arrange a funeral quickly have to agree their costs before they even know if they qualify for help or not			2
‘ this is worrying when we know 50 % of claims are rejected - about 30,000 a year			0
’ ms @entity3 asked for the need for an invoice to be removed , saying that this would allow people to check their eligibility before committing to funeral costs			1
she also suggested the @entity165 streamlines the process to result in quicker decisions			0
ms @entity3 was given permission to bring in the @entity192			2
she asked for it to be given a second reading on january 23			0
it is unlikely to become law in its current form without government support or sufficient parliamentary time .			0
