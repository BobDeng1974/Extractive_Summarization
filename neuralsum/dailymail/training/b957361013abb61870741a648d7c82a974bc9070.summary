by @entity0 published : 03:46 est , 26 september 2012 updated : 08:36 est , 26 september 2012 @entity1 , departing @entity2 executive who said @entity2 senior executives have affairs with each other a departing @entity2 chief has criticised the culture of its @entity9 - based staff claiming senior executives ' marry each other and have affairs with each other '			1
@entity1 , who leaves her position as chief operating officer today after 37 years , also warned the @entity2 could too easily become ' arrogant ' , ' above itself ' and ' forget about everyone else			1
' speaking at a conference yesterday , she offered advice to @entity19 , the man who beat her to become the new director - general			1
at the end of her speech at the @entity26 and @entity27 conference : ' my advice would be to make sure the @entity2 is confident but not arrogant			1
' that is easier said than done			1
' it 's quite easy for the @entity2 to get a bit above itself and forget about everyone else			1
' her comment about executives having affairs with each other was in response to a question about the @entity2 shift from @entity9 to @entity40			2
when miss @entity1 was asked if more of the @entity2 would move , she said : ' that was certainly the policy last year , so i assume it 's going to happen			1
' she said that units like those in @entity40 with a few thousand people were ' much more likely ' to be outward - looking that those with 10,000 people in one building , ' when they all eat and drink with each other and marry each other and have affairs with each other and so on			2
' about a sixth of the corporation 's output is now made in @entity40 it was announced last year that a further 1,000 posts were to be moved north , including the entirety of @entity62			1
some senior insiders now fear this might not now take place after a reluctance for employees to move from homes in @entity9 and a failure to attract high profile guests on certain shows			2
@entity72 in @entity40 , where miss @entity1 spoke at the @entity73 yesterday miss @entity1 - who last year earned almost £ 330,000 - had been expected to leave the corporation after losing out to mr @entity19			1
however she is leaving the corporation sooner than expected , amid reports of an ' awkward ' relationship between her and mr @entity19			1
the 58 - year - old ’s post is being axed and the @entity79 she ran is being dismantled to save money			2
the @entity2 is facing budget cuts of 20 per cent , with around 2,000 job losses , as a result of a tough licence fee deal with the government			2
miss @entity1 first joined the @entity2 after starting as a trainee journalist in 1975 and was a key player in the licence fee settlements in 2007 and 2010			1
she will leave next week with a £ 1.71million pension pot and could get up to 12 months of redundancy pay			2
@entity19 , who started his position as director - general last week and is set to reshape the @entity2 radically since the @entity2 began publishing the expenses claims of its top executives , her taxi claims have received attention with her regular use of cabs costing thousands of pounds of licence fee money each year			2
in a written transcript of her speech she said : ' it is always when the @entity2 loses sight of what it is here for that it runs into trouble with @entity108 payers			0
' the news comes after @entity110 yesterday revealed that a @entity2 site offering ' in depth analysis ' and research is available to everyone in the world except @entity117 licence fee payers			0
the @entity119 site is heralded as the new international technology , science , environment and health site , but is n't available to people in the @entity117 because it is an arm of the @entity2 that is not funded by the licence fee			0
this means , that despite @entity117 forking out almost £ 150 a year for a tv licence to fund the corporation , they are excluded from the international content			1
but @entity132 say it is the same ' genre ' of content already provided for @entity117 citizens - though the stories are not the same - and it was created for audiences outside the @entity117			0
the @entity119 website can only be accessed from outside of the @entity117 mr @entity19 , who started his position as director - general last week , is set to reshape the @entity2 radically and has been working with the accountancy firm @entity142 in recent weeks			0
the new @entity2 boss has hired consultants to help him reduce waste and slash the number of managers at the corporation			1
he is understood to have spent weeks hold up in an office looking at how to cut unnecessary waste and bureaucracy			0
earlier in miss @entity1 's speech she also criticised @entity154 , of @entity155			1
she said : ' @entity154 complained about government media regulation in the @entity117			0
he complained that because it was publicly funded the @entity2 was a threat to independent journalism , arguing that profit was the only reliable guarantor of independence			0
a lot has happened in those three years - need i say more ? ' she added : “ at this year ’s @entity166 , his sister expressed a different view , calling for profit to be pursued ‘ with a purpose ’			0
' but just because the @entity2 is a public service broadcaster does n’t automatically give it the moral high ground either			0
we have to be clear about our values			0
' they define us in our audiences mind , not just in the @entity117 but around the world			0
the particularly important point is ‘ trust ’			0
lose that and you have lost everything			0

@entity1 said the corporation could too easily become ' arrogant ' and ' above itself '
