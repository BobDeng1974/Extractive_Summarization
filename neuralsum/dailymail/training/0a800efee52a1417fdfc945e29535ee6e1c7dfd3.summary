sir @entity0 , who has died aged 88 , was @entity1 ’s first knight , and the holder of another unique distinction : he is the only man to have driven to a world title in a car he designed and built			1
but even before that feat in 1966 , he was assured of a place in motor - racing folklore , having pushed his car to the first of his three world titles in 1959 after running out of fuel 100 yards from the end of the @entity15 @entity14 at @entity16			1
with the rules forbidding anyone else from helping him , his strong frame proved equal to the task			0
@entity0 ’s success as a wily , combative driver , combined with his acumen as the owner of his eponymous team , elevated him to the status of sporting royalty in his native @entity28			1
his bust is displayed at the entrance to the paddock at the @entity28 @entity14 in @entity32 each year			2
in black and white : sir @entity0 , pictured here in 1969 , won three @entity1 titles in a glittering career on the road to glory : the @entity28 , competing in 1965 , is the only man to win a title in a car he built his death at his house on the @entity42 , after a long battle against kidney disease , was met by tributes from fellow racers from motor - racing ’s dangerous era			1
sir @entity49 said : ‘ my career would have been considerably less without him			0
every race — and i ’m talking 50 - odd times a year — we would fight against each other			0
‘ i remember in @entity55 in the early fifties , we were contending the @entity55 @entity14 , and i had a problem with my back axle			0
the first person who came up was @entity0 and he said , “ take it off my spare car , ” knowing very well that there was a good chance i might beat him			2
‘ that sums him up — a real sportsman and a good @entity28			2
’ sir @entity68 , whose career overlapped with @entity0 ’s , said : ‘ he was an extremely talented driver and deceptively fast			1
he was also a very aggressive driver and probably one of the most difficult to overtake			0
’ legend of the sport : @entity0 , seen here at the unveiling of his bust at the @entity76 , has died @entity77 : ' rip sir @entity0			1
what an amazing driver and man ‪ # ‎ legend ' ‬ @entity81 : ' sorry to hear about sir @entity0			1
a great @entity28 who inspired many @entity28 to pursue our dreams			2
' @entity85 : ' rip sir @entity0 ' @entity86 : ' @entity87 sir @entity0 ' @entity88 ‏ : ' our thoughts and prayers are with the family and friends of sir @entity0 , a true legend of @entity1			1
' @entity94 ‏ : ' sad news on the passing of sir @entity0			1
a great champion and grandfather of a family racing dynasty			0
' @entity100 ‏ : ' sir @entity0			1
may you rest in peace			0
' @entity104 ‏ : ' really sad news with the passing of sir @entity0 , a @entity107 , and great man			1
my thoughts go to all his family			0
' @entity112 ‏ : ' sad news about sir @entity0 passing away			1
a true legend & created a great racing dynasty of fast sons & grandsons ! # rip # @entity117 ' @entity0 , the grandson of a @entity119 emigrant to @entity120 , was born in an outer @entity122 suburb in 1926			2
his father was a grocer and taught @entity0 to drive as soon as he could reach the pedals			2
by then he had already taken an interest in the mechanics of his father ’s trucks and cars , a fascination with machinery that was to endure			0
after leaving school at 15 , @entity0 got a job in a local garage and studied engineering in the evening			2
he served during the war as an engineer in the @entity139 and opened a motor repair shop on demobilisation			0
having first raced on dirt tracks in @entity28 , @entity0 travelled to @entity143 in the mid- 1950s			1
he won the first two of his three world titles with @entity146 , before manufacturing his own winning car — the @entity148 — with the help of his compatriot @entity150			1
he was 40 by then and had been written off by many cognoscenti as past his best			0
to make this point someone sent him a long beard and walking stick , which he wore , as a joke against himself , on to the grid at @entity157 that year before driving to victory from pole position			0
it was a humorous touch from a taciturn , even shy , man			0
@entity0 won also two constructors ’ championships , in 1966 and 1967			1
he competed in 126 grands prix during a 15 - year @entity1 career , winning 14 races			1
he retired in 1970 , when he was 43 , bowing out after winning at @entity168 , @entity169			0
he would have continued but his first wife @entity170 and the family implored him to stop			0
picture that : @entity0 , at his home on the @entity42 in 2009 , will be remembered as a legend of the sport ‘ @entity0 ’ , as he was called , sold the @entity0 team to @entity176 yet it continued for 30 years , including under the ownership of @entity178 , for whom @entity179 won two world titles			1
he regretted severing his ties with @entity1 so abruptly			2
despite his immense achievement , which earned him a knighthood in 1979 , few commentators quite rank @entity0 among their golden handful of finest drivers , alongside the likes of @entity188 , @entity189 and @entity190			2
longevity : @entity0 's career in @entity1 spanned 15 seasons - he was 44 when he finally retired from the sport but it is impossible to imagine a current driver owning , managing and driving for his own team			1
as @entity198 , the @entity199 chairman , said this feat ‘ will surely never be matched ’			0
‘ @entity28 has lost a legend , ’ reflected @entity28 prime minister @entity201			2
@entity0 ’s youngest son , @entity203 , said : ‘ he lived an incredible life , achieving more than anyone would ever dream of			0
’ he leaves his widow , @entity207 and three sons , @entity203 , @entity209 and @entity210 , all of whom pursued motor - racing careers			0
his grandsons , @entity215 and @entity216 , are also racers , keeping alive an illustrious tradition into a third generation .			0

sir @entity0 died at his house on the @entity42 on monday *morning*
the @entity28 won three @entity1 world titles in 1959 , 1960 and 1966
he won 14 races and competed in *128* grand prix before retiring , aged 44
@entity228 has described @entity0 as an ' outstanding driver '
