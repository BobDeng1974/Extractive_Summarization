by @entity0 published : 18:00 est , 23 july 2012 updated : 03:44 est , 26 july 2012 @entity1 , seen here playing in a previous @entity2 , has been banned for taking part in future events radio dj @entity1 has been ' barred for life ' from golf ’s most glamorous celebrity tournament – after apparently giving himself too generous a handicap to help him win last year 's tournament			1
the broadcaster won the @entity2 last october with professional playing partner @entity11 but their 40 - under par performance over four rounds raised eyebrows			1
and now three months before he was due to defend the title he won last year , it has emerged that he will not be allowed to defend his title			0
@entity1 , 46 , and event organisers refused to fully explain why he has been banned but it emerged last night that it may be the result of @entity1 ’s handicap for last year			1
his handicap was 10 - meaning he can take ten shots off his actual score to give a ' net score ' that counts towards the final result - and he claimed after the win that he was given the impression organisers believed it was too high to reflect his ability			2
those who saw him play suggested that he should not have been allowed so many shots			0
@entity1 said this weekend : ‘ sadly , i will not be defending my title this year			0
why ? it transpires i ’ve been barred for life			0
‘ i could go into why but frankly it ’s all a bit of a bore			0
suffice to say , if we were kids in the playground , the boy who owns the ball just took it home in a huff because his team did n’t win			0
’ the annual event pro-am event sees teams of one professional and one celebrity playing rounds at each of the @entity50 at @entity51 , the championship course at @entity53 and world - class @entity55 , in @entity56			1
celebrities such as actors @entity58 , @entity60 and @entity61 regularly participate in the @entity63 event			1
and yesterday , @entity1 was still featuring on the tournament ’s website - and talking with delight about the victory			2
this time last year , writing in his column in the @entity73 ’s @entity72 magazine , the broadcaster revealed there had been ‘ rumblings of dissent ’			1
he wrote : ‘ along with congratulations , there were rumblings of dissent			2
the gloaming was dark with talk of my handicap being too high for my ability			2
’ life ban : @entity1 , pictured here with his wife @entity86 at last years tournament , said he thought of setting up an alternative tournament the @entity89 always attracts its fair share of celebrities , including actors and keen golfers @entity61 and @entity94 @entity1 play in the tournament off a handicap of ten , meaning he expects to go round a golf course in ten shots over par. in the @entity103 tournament the team score for each hole is the lower score of each pair , with the handicap taken into consideration			1
as the pairings are made up of one amateur and one professional , the amateurs receive a stroke allowance equal to two thirds of their handicap , suggesting @entity1 normally plays off 15			1
for the tournament he would have been given one shot on the course 's ten hardest holes ( those given a stroke index 1 to 10 ) each round - or a total of 40 over the whole tournament			2
so on a par 5 , @entity1 and @entity11 might have both taken four shots , but if it was recognised as one of the six hardest holes , @entity1 ' score would be a net three - or two under par for the hole			0
this is how they were able to run up net scores of 66 , 57 , 64 and 61 ( against par of 72 ) for a total of 40 - under pair , leaving organisers suggesting that a handicap allowing @entity1 24 shots was a little generous			2
but he is not alone , suspect high handicaps are the subject of much debate in golf clubs around the country			0
players who claim to have a higher handicap than their ability suggests are branded ' bandits '			2
the broadcaster also revealed he was the butt of jokes and asked : ‘ where did you get your handicap ? @entity153 ’ and ‘ where did you leave your sombrero ? ’ ‘ they were references to my ' bandit ' status , ’ he added			1
@entity1 went on : ‘ ok , so we finished 40 under par , which i ’ve never heard of before , but that was combination of mine and @entity11 ’s best score on each hole			0
‘ and when you consider the leading professional finished 22 under , i do n’t think that ’s entirely incredible			0
’ @entity169 with @entity170 and her son @entity171 during the event last year @entity173 and @entity58 have also taken part in the celebrity pro-am event but @entity1 ’s banishment has still come as a ‘ shock ’ because he had booked his holidays to coincide with this year ’s tournament			1
the former @entity181 friday star said : ‘ because of @entity183 ’s complicated schedules i have to book my holidays a year in advance			0
so i now have two weeks in october and nowhere to go			0
’ in spite of the ban , the broadcaster kept joking , suggesting he is considering setting up a rival competition for his golfing and celebrity pals			1
he said : ‘ any sour grapes ? not really			0
but it crossed my mind to set up an alternative tournament on the exact same dates			0
‘ i think i ’ll call it the @entity198			0
’ a spokesman for the @entity2 said : ‘ we have no comment to make			1
’ and a spokesman for the @entity203 added : ‘ we have no involvement in the celebrity invitations for this tournament			1
’ actor @entity60 is a regular fixture at the golf tournament			1
