@entity0 , chairman of the @entity1 , said @entity3 's ' credibility is on the line ' @entity3 's credibility suffered a major blow yesterday when scathing mps said the inspectorate was partly to blame for the @entity9 child sex abuse scandal			1
the education and child protection watchdog had given a clean bill of health to the town where as many as 2,000 children were exploited by gangs			1
yesterday a parliamentary committee probing @entity3 ’s work there called for urgent inspections of every council in the country with responsibility for child protection – to ensure large - scale abuse is n’t being ignored elsewhere			1
@entity0 , chairman of the @entity1 , said @entity3 ’s ‘ credibility is on the line ’			1
the @entity28 mp added : ‘ the perpetrators bear ultimate responsibility for the sexual exploitation of children in @entity9 but the ineffectiveness of @entity3 ’s inspections contributed to a failure to expose the extent of the problem			1
’ the fierce attack came on the day a second group of mps found flaws in @entity3 ’s handling of the @entity44 affair , in which @entity46 schools were accused of fostering religious extremism			1
the @entity48 said little evidence of radicalisation had been found and ‘ confidence in @entity3 has been undermined , and efforts should be made by the inspectorate to restore it ’			0
meanwhile , the @entity9 report pointed to @entity3 inspectors repeatedly labelling child protection in the town as ‘ adequate ’ – yet they were tied to their paperwork and had no idea what was really going on			1
instead , the inspectors simply accepted what they were told by local officials , and did n’t ask searching questions			0
‘ @entity3 does not appear to have probed beyond what it was told , and it failed to penetrate the professional jealousy and incompetence that distorted the operation of children ’s social care in @entity9 , ’ stated the report			2
it also described @entity3 ’s habit of calling the efforts of councils like @entity9 adequate as ‘ ambiguous ’			2
while @entity3 thought ‘ adequate ’ meant that improvement was needed , outsiders , including councillors , thought it meant ‘ satisfactory ’			0
‘ @entity9 appears to have gone a step further and interpreted it as indicating a strong performance			0
’ the @entity40 added that @entity3 was operating in a way that meant its different inspectors and departments did not discuss their findings with each other – and inspections of councils like @entity9 were ‘ too short and narrowly focused ’			2
they relied on paperwork – rather than actuality – and on what they were told by councils , who did not pass on concerns raised by whistleblowers and others			0
the education and child protection watchdog had given a clean bill of health to the town ( pictured ) where as many as 2,000 children were exploited by gangs ‘ we conclude that the experience of whistleblowers at @entity9 was the antithesis of what a good whistleblowers policy should be , ’ the @entity40 said			1
they called for @entity111 – who was sent in by the government to examine @entity9 ’s failures after the scandal broke – to carry out a second inquiry to check that the town is working more effectively			0
a similar inquiry should be held into @entity118 , they said			0
and they were ‘ uneasy ’ about the way in which @entity3 polices itself as it ‘ may not be sufficiently accountable for its performance ’			0
last night an @entity3 spokesman said : ‘ we welcome the report and the committee ’s recognition that the changes we have made since 2012 strengthen our ability to uncover where children are at risk			2
we know we did n’t get it right historically in @entity9 and have apologised for those mistakes			0

as many as 2,000 children were exploited by gangs between 1997 and 2013
mps probing @entity3 's work there said the body 's ' credibility is on the line '
they want inspections of all councils with child protection responsibilities
attack came after fellow mps found flaws in @entity3 ’s handling of @entity44 affair
