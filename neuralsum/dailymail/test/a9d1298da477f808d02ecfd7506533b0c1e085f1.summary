when @entity1 talked about @entity2 and @entity3 as coaches on the pitch last week , it actually revealed far more than you might at first imagine			1
football intelligence is something very few people are truly blessed with			2
@entity10 was highlighting these two because of their superior football intelligence			2
the backdrop is a season at @entity15 where @entity17 football looks likely , but at the same time it is fair to say @entity19 have only been truly convincing in a few isolated games			1
@entity1 has identified @entity2 ( left ) and @entity3 as two of his most bright players @entity10 demands a level of ' football intelligence ' from his players at @entity19 @entity19 now have a eight - point cushion over @entity27 and are in good shape to make the @entity17 @entity10 revealed why @entity19 have almost stumbled into the top four this season when he praised @entity2 and @entity3			1
he basically said too many players at @entity19 are n’t very bright			1
in fact they ’re pretty thick			0
of course there are exceptions : @entity34 is a cultured , classy individual on and off the pitch			1
@entity2 and @entity3 have football intelligence in abundance : hence @entity2 slipping seamlessly in and out of the centre - half position mid-game at times this season , and @entity3 slotting into whichever position @entity10 asks him to occupy			1
the @entity41 can trust these players			1
let me give you a couple of examples : last summer his first encounter with @entity48 was to set up a separate training regime for the teenager because he was so unfit			1
@entity48 admitted his manager was right and accepted he need to step up his mentality at his new club			2
@entity54 midfielder @entity34 is another cultured , classy player in @entity19 's team @entity3 showed plenty of intelligence to turn and volley home @entity19 's second goal on saturday @entity48 had to take part in extra pre-season training sessions to reach the necessary fitness levels imagine signing for @entity19 and being so unfit you ca n’t take part in pre-season training sessions			1
that ’s what happened to @entity48			2
@entity67 played well on saturday but at one point in the first - half with @entity19 pressing he launched a ridiculous pass from the right - wing position , back into his own half			1
it sailed over @entity75 ’s head and the @entity77 international had to chase back to retrieve it			0
it was a poor pass – that can happen			0
but choosing to make that pass in the first place was inexplicable			0
@entity10 was clearly frustrated on the sidelines by this poor in - game management from a top player			0
look at @entity86 bulldozing his way into challenges and getting nowhere near the ball			2
i ’m convinced that ’s part of the reason he gets so many injuries			0
@entity95 is a good footballer , but he ’s had several seasons of being turned into a target man by @entity98			0
he had any football intelligence hammered out of him			0
he regressed – he became not very bright			0
@entity67 score twice against @entity101 but also played a notably poor pass to @entity75 @entity86 makes himself prone to injuries by crashing into tackles @entity95 had his football intelligence hammered out of him by the disastrous @entity98 regime a continental colleague told me that @entity10 is frustrated by the lack of football intelligence he has found in the squad at @entity15			1
this is a guy used to working with erudite thinkers of the game at @entity115 , @entity116 and @entity117			0
at these clubs there is a true football philosophy built up over years that has stood the test of time and stands proud despite managers coming and going			0
@entity10 walked into @entity19 and found a club shorn of its direction			2
the dictator sir @entity126 was gone and any philosophy died with the departure of @entity126 , and then @entity98 's reign set the club back further			0
the @entity19 job is clearly far bigger than just signing @entity132 and thinking everything will be fine			2
and this issue of a lack of football intelligence in the squad and at the club needs a long - term solution			1
but at 63 has @entity1 got the time to impose a new philosophy on the club , to teach that intelligence needed ?			0

very few @entity19 players possess the intelligence demanded
@entity2 , @entity3 and @entity34 can claim to have it
the @entity41 *suggested* some of his other players lack brains
@entity48 was *n't* fit enough when he arrived last summer
@entity86 *thunders* **senseless*ly* into tackles and gets injured
even @entity67 is *guilty* of playing *senseless* long balls
@entity157 : @entity158 only turn it on when the pressure is off
@entity157 : @entity162 would be earning the same as @entity163 if he signed *£* *100,000* - a - week deal at @entity27 *...* that 's the real issue here
