marry me ? @entity1 was overwhelmed to receive marriage proposals from jihadists after revealing that she was a @entity4 a tattooed , blonde woman who grew up a @entity6 in @entity7 has been overwhelmed by marriage proposals from @entity10 fighters in @entity11 and @entity12 after one of her social media posts went viral			1
@entity1 , a foreign policy researcher , caught the attention of thousands by joining a @entity17 trend pointing out the difference between mainstream @entity19 and the jihadists bringing war and devastation to the @entity23			1
but she was shocked to find @entity10 jihadists appreciating her message - in which revealed herself as an unlikely convert to @entity19			1
the fighters , presumably besotted by her bright blue eyes and platinum blonde hair , were so taken with her that they started to send marriage proposals			0
miss @entity1 was brought up a @entity31 in @entity7 , uses @entity33 slang such as ' y'all ' - and admits nobody would guess she was a @entity4 at first sight			1
she now works for the @entity37 in @entity38 the message which captured the attention - and hearts - of so many was first posted to just 60 people			1
but within a day it had been reposted more than 11,000 times , gaining her thousands of new followers in the process , many of whose profile pictures showed them posing in front of the black flag of @entity10			2
the jihadists - many of whom post pictures of the group 's atrocities and try to tempt others to join their fight - then started reaching out to miss @entity1 , and even proposing			2
one of her new - found followers poses with a sword in his profile picture , and has tweeted pictures showing @entity10 beheading victims , as well as images of @entity64			0
and , despite the obvious enthusiasm for miss @entity1 's appearance , some of her new fans tried to impose their own interpretations of @entity19 onto her , saying she would look better with her head veiled			2
in the posts , @entity4 apologize for things which either they had nothing to do with - such as the outbreak of the @entity95 - or which are not bad , such as scientific or mathematical advances pioneered by @entity19 scholars			0
fan : this man , who poses on his @entity17 profile holding a sword and spreads images of @entity10 atrocities , is now among those who follow miss @entity1 but her apology , miss @entity1 instead revealed her own conversion story - how she had started to read the @entity107 for her work on terrorism - and ended up converting			1
she said : ' sorry i read the @entity107 to learn abt terrorist beliefs but ended up converting to @entity19 b / c of what it said			0
# muslimapologies # sorrynotsorry ' the response - presumably because of her @entity77 appearance - was overwhelming , propelling her into the consciousness of @entity10 militants on the front lines			0
writing about her bizarre rise to fame for the @entity122 magazine , she described how men from @entity124 as well as @entity10 - controlled lands started making approaches			0
she said : ' one guy told me how beautiful i would look in hijab ( in other words , how beautiful i would look once i covered myself up and stopped looking like an infidel )			0
another just straight up asked me to marry him			0
' miss @entity1 also found that her image - which some @entity4 blurred to adhere with their modesty rules - was being used to tout her as an @entity10 supporter , despite her obvious contempt for the group			1
she said : ' i , for one , do not appreciate having my conversion story used to attract more people to a repugnant ideology that spawns suicide bombings and beheadings			2
' however , she said she hopes her messages on @entity17 might encourage her newly - acquired fanbase to read the @entity107 further , which she believes might make them reconsider their jihad			0
disgust : miss @entity1 expressed her distaste at how her story - and image - are being used to imply that she supports the extremists in the @entity23			1
