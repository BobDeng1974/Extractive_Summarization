by @entity0 published : 08:47 est , 15 february 2013 updated : 15:51 est , 15 february 2013 @entity1 has been hit with its first lawsuit over the ' horrifying ' conditions passengers were forced to endure when the @entity6 cruise became stranded following an engine fire			1
@entity8 of @entity9 , @entity10 filed the suit less than 24 hours after arriving on dry land in @entity13 , @entity14 , alleging that she was forced to wade through human feces from overflowing toilets			0
her suit also claimed @entity1 failed to provide a seaworthy vessel and sanitary conditions			2
she suffered physical and emotional harm , including anxiety , nervousness and the loss of the enjoyment of life , according to the complaint filed in federal court in @entity28			2
whether lawsuits will be successful has been doubted by legal analysts , who have speculated passengers will find it difficult to sue carnival for any damages thanks to a legal structure shielding operators from big - money lawsuits			1
they 're home : the @entity6 cruise ship , which was at sea for an extra five days after an engine fire , is towed towards the dock as spectators watch at the port of @entity13 , @entity14 many will have unknowingly signed @entity1 's contracts prohibiting them from class action lawsuits , while the small print also bans them suing on the grounds of emotional distress , lawyers explained			1
it comes as the company offered each customer a compensation package and issued an apology on thursday - which many disgruntled passengers deemed too flimsy and too late			1
there has also been no sign of @entity1 chairman and ceo @entity62 , who was criticised in january last year for failing to travel to @entity64 and take personal charge of the @entity67 crisis			1
it seems he has not learned from his mistakes , as he has failed to publicly comment on the @entity6 incident and was not on the scene as the massive vessel docked in @entity13 , @entity14 on thursday			0
where is he ? @entity76 chairman @entity62 , pictured next to president @entity77 at a @entity79 game on tuesday , has still not made a public comment about the disaster arduous : the ship was pulled to shore by tugboats after an engine fire knocked out the power on sunday carnival has offered all guests : no doubt adding insult to injury , he was last seen on tuesday at the @entity93 as he watched a game between the @entity95 and the @entity79 , which he owns			1
his glaring absence could make customers more likely to lash out against the company in the courts			0
but for all their grievances , they may struggle to sue the operator , which has headquarters in both @entity105 and @entity106 , for any damages , analysts have speculated			2
tickets issued by @entity1 and other cruise companies contain language limiting how much a passenger can recover in a suit			1
@entity113 , with @entity28 - based @entity114 , told @entity115 : ' over decades the lawyers for cruise lines have drafted these contracts to really strip away all the rights of cruise passengers			1
' @entity113 said he has been contacted by @entity6 passengers about potential suits , but he said he expects few will make it to court			2
' there are certainly people who want lawsuits to be filed , ' he said			0
' but if you have received full compensation for the cruise , cruise credit , a little cash compensation on top of that - we certainly would n't be trying to do any better than that because the rights of the passengers are restricted			1
' great escape : passengers cheer after disembarking from the @entity6 cruise ship on thursday relief : @entity143 holds a sign referencing how passengers had to relieve themselves in red bags on dry land : @entity148 kisses the ground after stepping off the @entity150 in @entity13 he added that being upset by a journey is not grounds to sue - but becoming ill or injured is			1
while there have been no physical injuries , if a person contracted a disease from unsanitary conditions on the ship , they could argue for physical injury , maritime trial attorney @entity153 told @entity162			1
and due to the conditions on board , many could have been at risk of these diseases			0
' i think that a case can be made that everyone on that ship is at risk of actual physical injury , ' he said , adding that the cruise line will no doubt want to diffuse the situation as quickly as possible			1
' do these people want to take what @entity1 is offering and get on with their lives , or do they want to get into a long legal struggle that may not yield the results they want ? ' he said			2
@entity181 , an experienced maritime lawyer based in @entity28 , added that @entity1 has printed a prohibition on class action suits in its tickets , which would have only been typed in the small print			1
damage control : @entity76 president and ceo , @entity187 issues an apology on thursday night a @entity192 statute prohibits operators from putting such language on tickets , but @entity1 is incorporated outside the @entity192 , partly in @entity196 and @entity197 , he said			2
@entity1 said passengers will be reimbursed in full plus transportation expenses , a future cruise credit equal to the amount they paid , plus a payment of $ 500 a person to help compensate them			1
but @entity206 , a 50 - year - old from @entity207 who spent her birthday on the ship , scoffed at the compensation offer			0
' there are lost wages , i 've got a baby sitter at home and i had to take off work , ' she said			0
' the stench was awful			0
a lot of people were crying and freaking out			0
' some litigation could rest on the outcome of an investigation into the fire , which started in the engine room last sunday and knocked out the ship 's power			0
' @entity227 ' : passengers were forced to create makeshift shelters outside to escape the stench inside extreme situation : they moved beds to higher levels to escape sewage sloshing about in lower rooms ' restroom ' : a bag of human waste lies in a box on the outdoor deck of a room on the cruise ship there are questions over why the incident took out power on the 14 - year - old ship , which had mechanical troubles last month that delayed a similar cruise to @entity251			2
@entity254 officials said the two episodes were not related , but their proximity could help customers in their pursuit of compensation , experts said			2
many may fight for it following the disgusting conditions they were forced to endure , but @entity1 's chief executive @entity187 attempted damage control by stepping on the vessel last night			0
' i know the conditions on board were very poor , ' he told reporters			0
' i know it was difficult			0
i want to apologize for subjecting our guests to that			0
' we pride ourselves with providing our guests with a great vacation experience and clearly we failed in this particular case			0

legal analysts have cast doubt over whether lawsuits will be successful
passengers ' contract with @entity1 says they can not sue for emotional distress - only for physical injuries
@entity254 included a prohibition against class action suits in the small print
cruise line has offered passengers full reimbursement , transportation costs , a future cruise for the same cost and an extra $ 500
apology from @entity297 but no sign of carnival chairman @entity62
