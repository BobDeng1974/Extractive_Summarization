by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 19:18 est , 13 march 2013 updated : 04:05 est , 14 march 2013 millions of families will be no better off in 2015 than they were in 2000 due to a devastating attack on household finances , according to @entity6 ’s leading think tank			1
the average worker will have suffered the worst squeeze on incomes in memory by the time of the next general election , warns the @entity13			0
its bleak assessment comes less than a week before the @entity16 and piles pressure on chancellor @entity18 to take radical action to jump - start the economy			2
strain : there has been no real growth in income since 2000 , says the @entity13 , putting pressure on ordinary hard - working families there are record numbers in work in @entity6 , with nearly 30million in employment even despite the mounting risk of a triple - dip recession			1
but workers ’ real pay – what they earn after inflation – is plummeting as families around the country are hammered by paltry pay rises , soaring household bills and inflation , tax hikes and benefit cuts			1
speaking to the @entity45 , @entity13 director @entity44 said the 15 - year assault on living standards was unheard of			1
‘ it is unprecedented that people are getting worse off year on year , ’ he said			2
‘ and we reckon that by 2015 the average person will be no better off than they were at the turn of the century			0
fifteen years without real income growth is unprecedented , at least in living memory			1
’ average incomes continued to rise , albeit slowly , even after the start of the credit crunch in 2008			0
anger : off - duty police officers take part in a protest against wage caps , pension reforms and other austerity measures but real pay fell by 3.7 per cent in the 2010 - 11 tax year – the biggest drop since 1981 , according to the @entity13			2
spending power fell again last year and is set to fall this year and next with living standards only expected to start rising again in 2014 - 15			1
it means that once the higher cost of living has been taken into account , the average worker in @entity6 will have no more to spend in 2015 than they did at the turn of the century – signalling a decade - and - a - half of pain for millions of households			1
mr @entity44 said not all of the squeeze was down to the government as it tries to balance the books			0
squeeze : the @entity13 says 15 years without real income growth is ' unprecedented ' ‘ the really key thing about what has been happening over three years is that real earnings have been falling , ’ said mr @entity44			0
‘ this squeezed middle is squeezed because their earnings are falling – not because of higher taxes or lower benefits			0
’ inflation has been above the 2 per cent target since late 2009 and the @entity95 does not expect it to return to that level until 2016			0
there is also pressure from the increase in vat to 20 per cent , the loss or cut in child benefit for more than one million families and changes to tax credits			2
of those changes , mr @entity44 said : ‘ families with children have been hit significantly harder than families without children			0

tax and bill rises and benefit cuts hitting ordinary @entity6 hard
think tank says fall in living standards is ' unprecedented '
government *budget* - balancing is behind the decade and a half of strife
