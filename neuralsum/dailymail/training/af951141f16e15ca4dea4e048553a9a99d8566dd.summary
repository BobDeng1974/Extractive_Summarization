it was in 1998 that a @entity2 quarter - final defeat by @entity3 began a round of soul - searching in @entity6 football			1
it was in 2000 , after being eliminated at the group stage in the @entity10 ; or maybe it was four years later , when the same thing happened			1
that was when @entity13 and @entity14 implemented the reform of @entity6 football , from the roots up			1
yes , but what about 2009 when the under 21 team won the @entity10 ? surely , that was the key to it all ? so , how about none of it , or all of it , but in evolutionary stages ? how about instead of looking for one @entity27 moment that transformed @entity6 football - a flash of genius , a bright idea to be copied by @entity31 from the wilderness - we acknowledge that what sets them apart is that they are in a constant state of self - evaluation , while never allowing the free pass of treating a @entity2 as a dry run			1
@entity31 , who preciously imagine themselves to be in the same rebuilding stage as @entity45 once were , have meanwhile dumbed down expectations to a level that just qualifying is considered an achievement			1
@entity61 , the @entity62 general secretary , said @entity63 had done enough to justify two more years by simply getting to @entity47			1
that would never happen in @entity45			2
as for @entity66 ’s wish for @entity31 to be judged in 2022 in @entity67 - nine years away when he said it - there must have been guffaws in the fancy home of the @entity6 federation			1
why are @entity45 successful ? because they expect to be successful , they demand success - because their ambition is huge			1
if there is a problem it is addressed , but never at the expense of a major tournament			0
@entity13 and @entity14 revitalised the game in @entity45 , but they did not do so for the benefit of some distant point a decade away			1
not great expectations : for @entity88 and @entity89 's @entity31 , qualifying is considered enough launchpad : @entity91 celebrates scoring @entity3 's third goal to knock @entity45 out of the @entity93 at the quarter - final stage low ( left ) and @entity13 ( right ) and keeper @entity95 after @entity45 won third in the 2006 @entity2 when they began tackling the problems in the @entity6 game , issues of identity , style and youth development , they did so with a home @entity2 that was two years off in mind			1
there was , obviously , a longer game involving the identification and production of young talent that has come to fruition , spectacularly , at this @entity2 - but @entity13 ’s aims were as much short - term , because he knew his employers , and the country , would not accept that a tournament could be thrown away as a planning exercise			1
‘ i was always looking long - term but i knew we would be measured by our success at the 2006 @entity2 , ’ @entity13 said			1
‘ i was basically doubted for the two years i was coach			0
‘ we lost 4 - 1 to @entity119 in a friendly game three months before the tournament and everybody wanted my blood			0
we had another game three weeks later against the @entity125 , which we won 4 - 1 , and that victory saved my job			0
‘ the federation had been ready to make a change			0
they wanted the conservative approach again , not the revolution			0
but i kept being positive , explaining this was how i wanted us to play			0
i did not know if we would master it in time for the 2006 @entity2 but we would give it a shot			2
‘ we had the players for four weeks before the tournament and were able to get our thoughts across			0
they agreed to train the way we wanted them to , and to do extra work			0
soon they started to believe in the system			0
’ so , just to recap : the @entity6 were prepared to abandon reform because they feared not doing well in a @entity2 - and @entity45 has a different concept of doing well , too , when you consider one of the bouts of introspection was caused by only reaching the quarter - finals			1
might this also explain why they are such serial achievers ? imagine if @entity31 ’s recent @entity2 record read final , semi-final , semi-final , final			1
would revolution have been in the air ? the @entity62 is an organisation that introduced its own awards ceremony on the back of getting out of the group at the @entity10 in 2012			0
@entity13 ’s blueprint involved a very attack - minded style of play , moving the ball from front to back as fast as possible , but on the floor			2
he talked of giving the national team an identity : dynamic football			0
has that been the way @entity45 have played here ? the 7 - 1 scoreline against @entity47 would suggest so , but that is n’t the whole tale			1
were @entity45 dynamic against @entity171 in the quarter - final ? no , they played a slower , possession - based game , and won from a set - piece goal			1
indeed , @entity45 have scored more goals from set - pieces than any other team at the @entity2 , five by the time @entity40 volleyed in the first against @entity47 on tuesday			1
how so ? enter @entity181			0
picking battles : while leading a revolution as @entity45 coach , @entity13 still had to get results adaptable : current @entity45 boss @entity14 favours a dynamic style , but knows well when it 's not suitable young stars : @entity189 ( right ) celebrates captaining @entity45 to under - 21 @entity10 glory @entity191 has been assistant coach to low since he succeeded @entity13 in 2006			1
for several years now , he has been bemoaning the quality of @entity45 ’s set - piece play			1
@entity14 did not have the issue high on his agenda			2
the pair used to have bets about whether the team could even score from a corner , a good - quality bottle of red wine to the winner			0
then the head scout @entity203 returned from the @entity204 in @entity47 with the news that set - piece play was going to be absolutely vital at the @entity2 in 2014			1
if the conditions were tiring it would n’t be possible for @entity45 to play their normal , high - tempo way in every match			2
they would have , at times , to play slower , possession football and use the breaks in play to their best advantage			0
this was what @entity181 had been waiting to hear			0
he asked @entity14 for extra sessions geared to set - piece work			1
low , moaning and sceptical but trusting of his lieutenant , agreed			0
one imagines @entity181 has quite an impressive collection of @entity223 now			0
the second goal in the 4 - 0 win against @entity226 , the 2 - 2 equaliser against @entity228 , the only goals of the games against the @entity125 and @entity171 , and the opener against @entity47			2
not a bad run for a team that can not score from set - pieces			1
@entity235 , set piece , match : @entity239 ' headed winner against @entity171 is among five for @entity45 from dead - ball situations , more than any other team in the @entity2 mastermind : @entity45 's assistant coach @entity191 championed the importance of set pieces in @entity47 defected : after @entity31 's exit from the @entity2 , these fans lent their support to @entity45 against @entity171 low has also reset the balance between attack and defence , particularly now the brilliant @entity41 has been restored to his full - back role			1
using goalkeeper @entity254 as a glorified sweeper is another innovation that underlines the intellectual ambition of @entity6 football			0
having as good as invented the role through @entity260 in the first place , @entity45 now drive through the next evolutionary step			2
and yes , there are also landmarks in the development of this team - @entity13 ’s 2006 side is one , and the 2009 under 21 champions that his youth development revolution helped forge are another			2
against @entity47 , the starting line - up only included two players - @entity40 and @entity272 - who were not either members of the squad in 2006 or 2009			2
yet innovation and expectation is every bit as important			0
in 1972 , @entity45 came to @entity278 to play @entity31 in a @entity280 quarter - final			1
at that time , both countries had won a single @entity2			2
indeed , @entity45 had only recorded their first win over @entity31 in 1968 , in a friendly			1
that night , though , @entity31 were played off the park			2
the match is remembered for a stunning performance by @entity287 , but that was n’t the half of it			0
@entity291 and @entity292 , the full backs , kept switching flanks			0
@entity296 football had never seen anything like it			0
even now , it would be considered revolutionary			0
‘ they seem to have stood still , ’ was coach @entity301 ’s damning verdict on @entity31			2
and that is the essence of @entity6 success			0
it is not in one movement , one big idea : it is that they never stand still , they always expect , and they never throw a tournament away			0
final , semi-final , semi-final , final : and that , remember , was in the rebuilding stage .			2

@entity45 has endured a series of set - backs in recent decades that have incited soul - searching within their football ranks
they include the @entity93 quarter - final defeat by @entity3 , and going out in the group stage of the 2000 and 2004 @entity325
but there is no one @entity27 moment that was the *catalyst* for their changes
@entity13 and @entity14 led a grass roots football - up reform
but were expected to deliver results in big tournaments along the way
since 1998 , @entity45 have reached two @entity2 finals , two @entity2 semi-finals , a @entity342 final and a @entity342 semi-final
@entity63 was kept on as @entity31 manager for two more years after @entity31 failed to reach the knockout phase at @entity47 2014
@entity45 are *favourites* to beat @entity349 in *sunday* 's @entity2 final
