by @entity0 in @entity1 published : 02:33 est , 12 september 2013 updated : 14:50 est , 12 september 2013 vital weapons shipments from the @entity3 have begun to arrive in rebel fighting units that oppose the regime of dictator @entity6 in @entity7 , according to sources on both ends of the transactions			1
the light arms , ammunition and other small , trackable armaments – likely grenades , mortars and shells – are coming via clandestine @entity18 operations in a significant escalation of @entity3 involvement in the 30 - month - long civil war			1
the @entity22 promised in june that it would arm @entity24 forces who were not aligned with @entity27 radical groups , authorizing the @entity18 to do the heavy lifting and manage the pipeline			1
but news of the weapons ' long - awaited delivery comes at an awkward moment , a day after president @entity34 pledged to pursue diplomacy instead of military action			2
reinforcements : rebel fighting units like this one in the @entity7 city of @entity40 are starting to receive weapons from the @entity3 in a significant escalation of @entity3 involvement in the civil war assad in the sights : light arms , ammunition and other small , trackable armaments - likely grenades , mortars and shells - are coming via clandestine @entity18 operations , according to sources on both ends of the transactions the @entity54 reported late wednesday night that the @entity18 has expanded its clandestine network of bases in bordering @entity57 and @entity58 over the past year , initially to help allies like @entity60 and @entity61 to send weapons across the @entity7 border			1
now those installations are the conduit for @entity3 military hardware destined for moderate rebel factions organized under the banner of the @entity69			1
that fighting force , outnumbered and outgunned , is led by gen. @entity71 , a former @entity7 @entity72 commander who defected in 2012			2
opposition fighters have sustained heavy losses while they waited for the @entity3 to send the cavalry , in often gruesome battles that have killed more than 100,000 and turned 2 million civilians into refugees			1
last week a career @entity3 intelligence official told @entity81 that the delay was in part due to a turf battle between the intelligence and diplomatic communities in @entity1			1
bad timing : news of the long - awaited weapons delivery comes at an awkward moment , a day after president @entity34 pledged to pursue diplomacy instead of military action backing a tyrant : a @entity7 woman holds a portrait of president @entity6 as pro-regime supporters parade their cars in @entity98 to celebrate the leader 's 48th birthday on september 11 speaking on condition of anonymity , the source said that while higher - ups in the @entity106 understood that @entity18 officials would be in charge of shipping arms to border stations and transporting them into @entity7 , they wanted a say in the delivery timetable			1
' it was disheartening , ' the source said , ' to see the @entity24 guys gasping for breath while the brains at @entity118 [ where the @entity106 is headquartered ] talked about choosing the right moment to turn the tide			0
' the @entity106 replied that it ' can not detail every single type of support that we are providing to the opposition or discuss timelines for delivery			0
' ' [ b ] ut it ’s important to note that both the political and the military opposition are and will be receiving this assistance			2
' news that @entity3 weapons are making it to rebel fighting groups will provide the latest in a whiplash - inducing series of developments in @entity1 since a chemical weapons attack killed more than 1,400 @entity7 on august 21			1
less than two weeks ago , @entity34 asked a vacationing @entity137 to approve a resolution authorizing him to launch military strikes in retaliation			2
after a week 's reflection , the @entity141 - controlled @entity22 watched warily as the @entity144 - controlled @entity143 rushed through committee hearings and was poised for a floor vote			0
not in favour of military action : nearly half of those polled said the @entity3 does not have an obligation to punish regimes like @entity7 that use chemical weapons to kill civilians then in what a @entity22 official later conceded was a ' major goof , ' secretary of state @entity155 answered a reporter 's question during a press conference monday in @entity162 by quipping that if @entity6 wanted to avoid a @entity3 attack , he could ' turn over every single bit of his chemical weapons to the international community in the next week			1
' ' he is n't about to do it , ' @entity155 quickly added , ' and it ca n't be done , obviously			0
' but @entity169 , a key @entity6 ally with a strategically irreplaceable naval base on @entity7 's @entity172 coast and a continuing series of its own arms deals in play , leaped into the diplomatic opening			0
in the space of hours , the @entity169 and @entity7 foreign ministers said publicly that @entity155 's ' proposal ' was to their liking			0
the result was an historic backpedal by the @entity22 on the day the president was expected to argue in favor of military force in a series of six television network interviews , and a day before a scheduled prime - time public address			2
now @entity169 president @entity189 has emerged with a diplomatic coup , promising to help @entity6 surrender his suddenly declared chemical weapons stockpiles on what the @entity22 conceded wednesday is an unspecified timetable			0
@entity34 was left tuesday night to tell the @entity3 people that he had asked @entity137 to put his war - powers resolution on the back burner while international negotiations play out			1
what @entity34 surely knew when he first asked @entity137 to approve military intervention – although the public was n't informed – was that @entity3 military hardware was already crossing the @entity7 border			1
it 's unclear whether , at the time , the @entity22 told key members of @entity137 what the @entity18 was doing			1
@entity207 sen. @entity206 , the ranking @entity141 on the @entity208 , crafted the war powers resolution with his @entity144 counterpart , @entity211 sen. @entity210 , the committee 's chairman			2
yet three weeks ago @entity206 was embarrassed when @entity7 on the @entity57 border begged him for the speedy dispatch of @entity3 weapons			1
' it was humiliating , ' he told the @entity54			0
' the president had announced that we would be providing lethal aid , and not a drop of it had begun			0
they were very short on ammunition , and the weapons had not begun to flow			2
' ' there 's been a major disconnect , ' @entity206 said on sept. 2 , between what the administration has said it 's doing relative to the rebels and what is actually happening			0
the pipeline has been incredibly slow			0
it 's really hurt morale among the @entity7 rebels			0
' on wednesday morning at a @entity238 breakfast in @entity1 , @entity236 @entity141 sen. @entity235 hinted after @entity34 's prime - time address that he believed the moderate @entity7 opposition was still playing a waiting game with the @entity3 ' i guarantee i 'm going to hear from gen. @entity71 today , ' @entity235 said , ' and he 's going to say , " have you abandoned us ? have you abandoned us ? are n't you going to help us ? " ' ' and my answer is going to have to be , " general , i will do everything i can to try and get support for you			1
" ' word of warning : @entity169 's president , @entity189 , says a @entity3 strike will bring more violence other nations have been supplying and resupplying the @entity24 rebels while the @entity3 dithered , most significantly the @entity60 and @entity61 shipments that the @entity18 was facilitating through its stations in @entity57 and @entity58			1
but the @entity34 administration will continue to face tough questions about why its june 2013 promises took three months to fulfill			0
a month after that pledge , @entity155 met at the @entity265 headquarters with @entity266 , a former @entity7 political prisoner who now leads the @entity267 , the largest @entity268 - backed opposition group			0
@entity266 said in a statement on july 26 that his people 's situation was ' desperate ' without sufficient weapons to hold its positions in @entity98 suburbs , and in the more distant provinces of @entity277 , @entity40 and @entity278			0
opposition forces , he said then , needed swift @entity3 action ' to push the international community to demand a political transition			1
' in the late spring , the @entity34 administration 's daily drumbeat on @entity7 included assertions that @entity3 involvement was aimed at forcing @entity6 from power			1
' we have been making clear as a matter of @entity3 policy that we believe that @entity6 must not continue to rule @entity7 , ' @entity22 press secretary @entity289 said during a briefing on may 29			2
' we are unapologetic , ' he added , ' about a policy position that calls for a future in @entity7 that does not include a tyrant who has demonstrated his willingness to murder his own people			0
' but in the week following the aug. 21 chemical weapons attack , @entity289 began to provide fuel to skeptics who feared @entity3 promises of concrete help for rebel groups would go unfulfilled			2
' i want to make clear , ' he told reporters on aug. 28 , ' that the options that we are considering are not about regime change			0
they are about responding to a clear violation of an international standard that prohibits the use of chemical weapons			0
