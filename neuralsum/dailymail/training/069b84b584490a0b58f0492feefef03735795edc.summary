@entity0 was once famed for its spectacular heritage sites , but new satellite imagery shows at least 290 cultural monuments have been destroyed or damaged since the outbreak of war in 2011			1
@entity0 is home to archaeological treasures that span thousands of years of written history , from the @entity9 ruins in the desert oasis of @entity11 to the towering @entity13 castle known as the @entity14 near the @entity16 coast			2
the nation 's capital , @entity19 , is also one of the oldest continually inhabited cities in the world			2
as evidence emerges of the extent of the devastation caused by the civil war , experts also claim ancient treasures dating back three millennia have been plundered and are being sold on the @entity31 black market and @entity32 to fund @entity34 terrorists			1
classical - period site @entity62 in eastern @entity0 , which was founded in the third century @entity63 and boasts one of the world 's earliest churches , is one of dozens of sites now covered in looters ' pits			1
valuable artefacts such as @entity9 busts are now being touted in @entity31 and the @entity73 and a @entity75 coin collection from @entity0 has even appeared on @entity32 , according to experts			2
@entity78 , who founded @entity79 , said : ‘ we have seen a great deal of evidence of ancient @entity0 artefacts making their way into the @entity31 and the @entity73 , ’ he said			2
‘ recently a middle - man approached me with a catalogue of important objects we believe were taken from sites within the @entity0 war zone			1
some with evidence of dirt still on them were being offered for sale			2
' any respected dealers should not touch them , as dealing in looted works from war zones could directly fund terrorism			1
‘ we feel that @entity0 has potential for the worst looting we have ever witnessed and it represents the biggest cultural threat since the @entity104			2
’ @entity0 archaeologist @entity105 said he recently saw coins dating from @entity107 , believed to have been smuggled from @entity0 , being sold on @entity32 with a guide price of £ 73			0
‘ the advert said the coins came with some original find dirt , which was a real give away , ’ said the professor of @entity111 history at @entity112 , @entity113			0
‘ these types of objects are now starting to appear much more online , especially on the dark net			0
’ @entity120 also provided satellite images of @entity122 , in the ancient oasis city of @entity11 , showing how it had changed between 2009 and 2014 the archaeological site of @entity62 near the western @entity0 village of @entity126 on september 4 , 2011 ( @entity127 ) and on on april 2 , 2014 ( r ) appears to show significant damage to the landscape as a result of the war a picture taken on march 14 , 2014 , shows the courtyard of the sanctury of @entity135 in the ancient oasis city of @entity11 , an ancient @entity137 in central @entity0 rebel fighters fire machine guns on the frontline during the battle against pro-government forces for control of the @entity145 region , just north of @entity50 ancient treasures have been plundered from @entity0 sites inlcuding in @entity11 , northeast of @entity19 ( pictured with a @entity0 policeman ) and are being sold on the @entity31 black market and @entity32 looters tasked by @entity57 have sunk several large pits in the ancient @entity153 city @entity154 , eastern @entity0 , which dates back to 2900 bc. they have destroyed key structures within the famous ' palace of @entity157 ' , which was stormed by @entity158 in the mid- 18th century @entity63 ‘ the situation is much more critical now particularly in areas under the control of @entity57 , ' said professor @entity105 , who is part of a group that monitors the scale of looting using satellite imagery and undercover activists on the ground			1
' it is now becoming a lucrative enough enterprise for them to kill to preserve it			0
‘ at first when @entity57 entered these areas , they sanctioned the plundering of ancient sites as long as they were given a percentage and this encouraged more people to dig up the sites			1
‘ but now @entity57 has started to bring in its own contractors			0
they are using heavy machinery and bulldozers to excavate , destroying these important sites			1
‘ the cultural heritage of @entity0 is being pillaged at an ever - accelerating rate			0
to see it destroyed like this for the sake of profit is very upsetting and distressing			1
‘ when you destroy this cultural heritage and the shared past , then you also destroy any chance of a future			0
’ the renowned @entity13 castle @entity14 near the @entity0 - @entity195 border has also been damaged extensively in the conflict the minaret of a famed 12th century @entity199 mosque is shown before it was destroyed by shelling in the northern city of @entity50 more than 80 archaeologists and scholars from around the world have signed an open letter calling on the @entity37 @entity205 to ban illicit trade in @entity0 antiquities			1
@entity208 from @entity210 ’s @entity209 is supporting the ban and said he was calling upon those in the arts market to not trade in @entity0 antiquities as it could fund terrorism			0
@entity216 , who set up @entity218 's @entity217 , said many valuable objects are going into vaults in @entity221 and @entity222 where they will be held for several years			0
‘ i ’ve seen reports of increased objects entering the @entity73 market and that is probably because they monitor the input so rigorously			0
‘ at the moment if artefacts enter the @entity31 market , they will be the everyday items			0
the important objects such as the mosaic floors we will only start seeing in 10 or 15 years time after the conflict			0
‘ in @entity31 the policing of illicit trade in antiquities is totally inadequate			0
there are a maximum of four officers covering that type of crime , so they are very stretched			0
’ a new report by the @entity120 ( @entity120 ) has revealed the extent to which some of the world 's most historic sites have been damaged			1
it has long been known that @entity0 's archaeological sites have been looted and its historic buildings damaged since the country 's conflict began in march 2011			1
however , analysing satellite images of 18 cultural areas , @entity120 determined that 24 sites were totally destroyed , another 104 sites were severely damaged , 85 moderately damaged and 77 possibly damaged			1
the 12th century @entity14 castle is among the nearly 300 cultural sites that have been damaged by the ongoing violence in the country the ancient oasis city of @entity11 , northeast of @entity19 , is considered one of @entity0 's most important cultural sites the evidence provides ' alarming testimony of the ongoing damage that is happening to @entity0 's vast cultural heritage ' , @entity120 said			1
' @entity271 and international efforts for the protection of these areas need to be scaled up in order to save as much as possible of this important heritage to human - kind			0
' @entity278 in @entity50 , @entity19 , @entity11 and the @entity14 have all sustained major damage , according to @entity120			2
sites across the country have been exposed to different threats			2
in some places , shelling and other military activity are responsible for the destruction , while in other places illegal excavations and civilian construction are to blame			0
the report offers before and after photographs from several sites that indicate the scale of the loss			1
photos of @entity50 show grey craters and mounds of rubble around the city 's famed citadel where historic buildings , including the @entity303 hotel , used to be			1
heavy damage is also evident to the @entity305 , which has lost its 11th - century minaret			2
images from the ancient city of @entity62 and @entity11 show extensive looting , with the ground peppered with holes from unauthorised digging			1
a @entity314 spokesman said that @entity315 had not come into contact with any items from @entity0 , while @entity32 said : ' we provide guidance to @entity32 sellers in our help section to make sure that any artefacts they may try to sell comply with the guidelines issued by the authorities , and are always ready and willing to investigate any listings causing concern			0
' we work with experts and will remove items from sale based on their advice			0
