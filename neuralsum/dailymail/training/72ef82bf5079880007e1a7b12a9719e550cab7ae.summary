a man who collects @entity2 cars has transformed the classic @entity5 vehicles into a monster truck , a limousine , a hovercraft , a convertible and a @entity10			1
@entity11 , a software engineer from @entity12 , @entity13 , is fanatic about the two - door sports car and owns five custom creations - including a stretched @entity16 - and three stock deloreans			1
the 50 - year - old has re-modeled the stainless - steel shape of the iconic cars into bizarre and brilliant automotive creations in an ongoing , 14 - year series of projects			0
@entity11 's first custom creation - a huge monster - truck , dubbed the @entity38 , is based on a 1981 @entity40 's body but mounted onto the running gear of a 1979 @entity42			1
the huge hybrid is fitted with custom wheels and 44 - inch tall tires , twice the size of the average cars and a v8 motor			0
the @entity10 : the car enthusiast will only use damaged deloreans for his projects , as there were under 10,000 of the @entity2 model ever made before the company went bankrupt			1
the convertible : he said , ' i have so many different ideas for custom deloreans , i 'm not sure if time , money or age will stop me from building them but as long as i 'm able i 'll continue to build them ' @entity11 said : ' even though the monster truck is a huge project , it actually only took me and my team a month to build it			1
' we married the two vehicles together , @entity2 body and 4x4 chassis , and then we did a few monster - sized upgrades			2
' the car enthusiast will only use damaged deloreans for his projects , as there were under 10,000 of the @entity2 model ever made before the company went bankrupt			2
the @entity2 limousine stretches the length of a school bus with six distinctive gullwing doors and uses parts from as many as six different damaged cars , all on a custom fabricated , stainless steel stretched frame			0
his hero : the projects started after @entity11 met the car 's founder @entity40 at the @entity45 in 2000 and showed him some of his ideas and sketches the original : his delorean obsession pre-dates the @entity5 movies to when he first saw the @entity2 prototype as a young man in the 1980s ( pictured , in a scene from 1990 's @entity111 ) it is 26 feet long and it took @entity11 several years to acquire all the parts needed from numerous damaged deloreans			1
@entity11 said : ' it 's got three pairs of gull wing doors , so we have six fully operational doors on there , and having six standard - sized gullwing doors has never been attempted , as far as i know , on any kind of limousine			2
' probably for good reason , since gullwing doors are very difficult to try to align exactly right			0
' @entity11 from @entity12 , @entity13 , built a custom hovercraft using the stainless steel panels of the @entity2 and a hovercraft cushion which allows the @entity2 to float over any surface			1
his delorean obsession pre-dates the @entity5 movies to when he first saw the @entity2 prototype as a young man in the 1980s			0
@entity11 said : ' my friends all know me as the guy with the @entity2 , all my co-workers know me by the guy with the deloreans			0
' my family obviously knows i 've been rather obsessed with deloreans since i bought my first one back in 1985			0
' i have so many different ideas for custom deloreans , i 'm not sure if time , money or age will stop me from building them but as long as i 'm able i 'll continue to build them			0
