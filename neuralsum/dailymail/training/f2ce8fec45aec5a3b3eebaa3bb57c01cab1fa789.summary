by @entity0 published : 17:52 est , 7 february 2014 @entity2 : 19:47 est , 7 february 2014 when you ’re at the wrong end of the table training ground fights become big news			1
they happen regularly at every club but when you ’re struggling , you can guarantee snippets of a bust - up will get out			1
i lost count of the number i saw over the years			1
some of them lingered , and grudges have started as a result and the players concerned never get over it			1
most of them were forgotten in an instant and accepted as part of the game			2
you shake hands , move on			2
does n't look good : @entity27 dispensed with manager @entity28 on tuesday after a poor run change of tune : nobody had a problem with @entity28 's relaxed training methods when @entity27 were winning usually they blow up from a bad challenge in a game but the game is less physical now and consequently there are fewer heavy tackles flying in during training sessions as the game now has an emphasis on interceptions			1
little flare - ups and arguments , even when team - mates are playing on the same side , happen all the time at all levels of the game			1
i have played in a few media games now and seen some classic head throws			2
in that lovely stadium in @entity53 , i lost it myself with @entity56 ’s @entity55 when he failed to pass			1
so it ’s amusing , even now i ’m in the media , that training ground bust - ups always seem to fascinate the press , and the public of course			1
let 's be friends : new interim manager @entity65 makes up with @entity66 after a previous disagreement happier times : @entity69 and @entity66 celebrate winning the @entity70 under @entity28 in 2013 before he was brutally axed by @entity27 this week , @entity28 had to deal with a training ground bust - up between @entity66 and @entity65 , who has now interestingly been appointed interim manager			1
i wish him all the best			0
@entity28 made the point that nothing came out of @entity77 on their way to the title last season , but as they ’ve had their struggles in @entity84 ’ first season , stories have come out of the training ground			1
invariably , these scrapes are nothing but when they become an issue the manager has to be seen to deal with it			1
otherwise the suggestion is that he has lost control of the training ground			1
fired up : @entity98 convincingly beat @entity27 in @entity28 's last match in charge of the @entity101 it has been a tougher second season for @entity27 and there were rumours that @entity28 was going to leave at the end of the season			1
perhaps that influenced the board ’s decision with their team now just two points above the relegation zone and struggling to hurt teams and score goals			1
they want to appoint a long - term successor now and halt the alarming slide			2
but the way the club have got rid of @entity28 has really surprised me			1
his relaxed style of management , not being on the training ground every day , was not a problem when @entity27 were winning			1
i doubt he has managed the club any differently from day one			0
but it is scrutinised and criticised when you ’re not winning			2
split : @entity27 chairman @entity129 ( left ) was the man responsible for telling @entity28 his was sacked the supporters ’ trust has a 20 per cent stake in the club and a say in how it is run			1
so they do consult with chairman @entity129 , who was the one to inform @entity28 he was sacked			1
but in doing so they have totally severed the ties with a manager who guided @entity27 to a @entity70 win less than a year ago and took them back into @entity140			1
he was being linked with the @entity143 job in the summer			0
last season i saw @entity27 quite a few times and for the first six months they were brilliant and good to watch			1
under @entity148 there was a lot of possession and passing football but they posed more of a threat under @entity28 , especially with the addition of @entity154 , who was arguably the signing of last season			1
he was certainly the best value for money			0
missed : @entity27 have struggled without the regular goal supply of injured striker @entity154 ( centre ) it has not helped @entity27 that @entity154 has been missing for so much of this season and quite often , when he has played , he has not been fully fit			1
@entity154 scored 22 goals in all competitions after his move from @entity166 but this season he has scored just four and played in 15 games			1
he has been a big miss and his return could n’t have come at a better time			2
they have had to rely on another new signing in @entity173 for their goals and he has scored seven in the @entity177 , most when @entity27 have been out of games			1
he has only scored one when they ’ve won , and that was a penalty			0
on target : @entity173 has performed well in @entity154 's absence , but @entity27 have still laboured strikers will tell you that goals are goals , and they all count			1
i was no @entity187 , but i prefer to see them scoring when they really matter , particularly when a team is struggling			0
the dressing room door slammed shut			0
i had my eyes to the floor			0
i knew what was coming			0
and i knew i was getting it			0
it may have only been a reserves game we ’d just lost but it was @entity200 v @entity199			2
it was still a derby			0
and @entity202 did not want to lose it			0
but he did lose it with me , and rightly so			0
fiery temper : then @entity200 boss @entity202 criticised me heavily in front of team - mates when i played for the @entity208 it was a close game , heading for a score draw and we were injury - time			1
i was playing at centre - back , brought a ball down near the edge of our area , and flicked it across to my central defensive partner			2
i did n’t hit it hard enough , a nippy teenage striker sneaked in and scored the winner			0
he opened the tirade with a few choices in rapid succession			0
‘ you ’re the most experienced player out there , ’ he shouted			0
‘ you still just boot it in the stands			0
’ and so it went on for a good few minutes			0
every word , every insult was justified			0
around me were young lads just starting out			0
i was old enough to be a couple of their dads but that did n’t bother @entity202			0
it was no different to a rollicking i ’d have got 20 years ago			0
play the right way : @entity202 would always encourage his midfielders to enjoy the game and to pass it around no doubt like his father , @entity202 can be hard and he can cut players down with one comment			2
i liked his management style , the way he worked and the things he said to me			2
he wants his team to play in what i would deem the right manner , and to go out and express themselves			0
whenever i played in his four man midfield , he always told us to go out and enjoy ourselves and do n’t hold back			0
he got that into the players every day and would stop a session if a player was holding back and not doing things naturally			2
@entity259 were awful on tuesday , there ’s no getting away from that			0
but @entity261 thoroughly deserved their victory , their second at a @entity177 ground after beating @entity265 in the third round			2
of course the priority is wins in their @entity270 relegation battle			0
@entity271 was sacked after 10 games because @entity261 were in the bottom four			2
like @entity273 and @entity274 in this division , @entity261 and the supporters believe they should be in the @entity277 , at @entity278 - up @entity279 villain to hero in a week			2
his tactical masterclass at the @entity282 has thrown the title race wide open			0
and was nearly as good as @entity284 ’s at @entity285			0
all right , it was one of the best we ’ve seen			0
but did we really expect anything else ? masterclass : @entity290 boss @entity279 reminded everyone of his tactical genius against @entity293 thumbs - down @entity295 ‘ supporters ’ it is disgusting that @entity297 can not go to a football match in peace			1
the people responsible for spitting and throwing coins at the @entity303 manager have no place in football grounds			1
targeted : @entity303 boss @entity297 was spat at and pelted with coins by @entity295 fans watching a game at @entity310			2

training ground bust - ups happen all the time in football and do n't indicate a manager has lost control of his players
@entity28 had to deal with one between @entity65 and @entity66 before he was sacked as @entity27 boss
@entity65 has now been appointed as interim @entity321 manager
@entity28 's relaxed managerial style was n't a problem when @entity27 were winning more matches
@entity27 have really missed the injured @entity154 's regular supply of goals this season
