@entity0 is not a name many of us have heard before			0
he played for @entity3 and is the youngest player ever to represent @entity5			0
that apart , the 24 - year - old centre forward has lived his professional life pretty much in the shadows			0
shortly after five past eight , however , the @entity10 forward found himself thrust centre stage in this replay rather sooner than he would have aniticipated			1
it is a moment that will stay with him for a rather long time			0
@entity16 breezed past @entity10 in their @entity18 fourth round replay at @entity19 on tuesday night @entity20 and @entity21 both scored in the first half as @entity16 sealed their place in the fifth round of the @entity18 @entity16 set up a fifth round tie against @entity26 after seeing off @entity27 in their fourth round replay at @entity19 @entity29 came off the bench to add a third goal for @entity16 in the second half at @entity19 @entity0 had an excellent opportunity to give @entity10 the lead in the first minute but hit the outside of the post @entity0 and his @entity10 team - mates react in despair after seeing his shot flick the outside of the post and go wide @entity16 : @entity40 6 , @entity41 7 , @entity42 6 , @entity43 6 , @entity21 6.5 ( @entity44 81 ) , @entity45 6 , @entity46 7 , @entity47 7 ( @entity48 71 , 6.5 ) , @entity20 7 , @entity49 6.5 ( @entity29 66 , 7 ) , @entity50 7.5			1

ratings by @entity78 less than a minute had gone — kick off having been delayed by traffic issues — when @entity16 ’s @entity45 rather inexplicably played a pass directly into @entity0 ’s path to set him clean through on goal			1
the pass could not have been more perfect for a centre forward had @entity45 played it there on purpose			0
it sent @entity0 clear with time to spare			0
it gave him time to think and perhaps this was the problem			0
had the @entity27 player needed to rely on instinct , maybe he would now be telling his friends about the night he stunned @entity19 with a goal in front of the @entity94			1
instead , @entity0 eased forward rather unconvincingly towards @entity10 goalkeeper @entity95 and could only place his shot against the left upright			1
it was a decent effort , certainly nothing to be ashamed of			0
but in that moment a career defining opportunity had come and gone			0
such are the margins between notoriety and humdrum anonymity in the @entity18			1
‘ he did everything right , ’ said @entity0 ’s manager @entity104 afterwards			0
had he done so , he would have scored			0
even if that had happened , @entity27 would not have won this game			1
money candidly acknowledged as much in his post-match interviews			0
@entity10 were too strong , too organised and purposeful			1
the team from @entity113 would have led at the most famous football stadium in @entity115 , though , and that would have been a story all on its own			0
kick - off in the @entity18 fourth round replay at @entity19 was delayed by 20 minutes due to traffic problems @entity121 midfielder @entity20 opened the scoring for @entity16 25 minutes into the game at @entity19 @entity20 flicked home @entity126 's cross from six yards out to give @entity16 the lead over @entity27 the @entity128 watches his effort loop up and into the back of the net to give his side the lead at @entity19 @entity20 finished off @entity47 's cross from six yards out to break the deadlock and put @entity16 ahead the @entity128 runs away to celebrate his goal with @entity50 in the 25th minute of the @entity18 fourth round replay @entity20 's opening goal as shown by our match zone graphic			1

as it was , that fleeting passage of play transpired to be @entity27 ’s best of the night			1
they spent the majority of the next 89 minutes in their own half and although @entity10 were not always fluent , the home team were efficient enough			1
they were two - nil up and seemingly already in the next round by half time			1
as is often the case this season , @entity10 ’s early football was not that exciting			1
set up this time by a coach still searching for the right system in some kind of 4 - 1 - 4 - 1 formation , @entity10 were rather dysfunctional for 20 minutes or so			1
not until @entity46 — playing deeper than @entity50 — drove a shot at goalkeeper @entity57 in the 18th minute did they have an effort on target			2
@entity166 defender @entity21 doubled @entity16 's lead over @entity10 in the 32nd minute at @entity19 @entity21 headed in a cross beyond the reach of @entity27 defender @entity57 on the line to put @entity16 2 - 0 ahead @entity21 looks to the heavens as he celebrates scoring @entity16 's second goal against @entity10 after opening the scoring , @entity20 has now been involved in 15 goals in his last 15 @entity18 matches - scoring six and assisting nine			1
indeed , a minute or so before they took the lead , @entity10 ’s body language began to look a little suspect			2
when @entity20 did eventually nudge them ahead in the 24th minute , it was a goal that had arrived at just the right time			2
a nice pass infield from the impressive @entity41 — playing at right back — began the move and eventually @entity126 was provided with possession in space down the left			0
the @entity166 had endured a patchy evening but the cross he lofted to the far post was perfect for @entity50			2
when the big midfielder nodded the ball down , @entity20 was alert enough to poke it high in to the net from about four yards			2
after almost 115 minutes of play against a team from the bottom rung , a goal was greeted with some relief by @entity10			2
within ten minutes they had another			0
@entity29 came off the bench to score @entity16 's third goal in the 73rd minute to finish off @entity10 @entity29 fired home from the edge of the area as his low shot found the bottom corner with 17 minutes to play in the replay @entity29 jumps in the air to celebrate after scoring the third goal for @entity16 in their fourth round replay this time @entity50 peeled away to collect an overhit corner and when his shot was blocked @entity209 chipped the ball towards @entity21			1
he headed home to give @entity10 breathing space			2
@entity27 by now looked beaten but by no means bowed			2
as was perhaps to be expected , though , @entity10 ’s football became more expansive as the game wore on			2
@entity46 brought a save from @entity57 with a crashing volley in the second half while @entity49 was denied by the goalkeeper at the foot of the post			0
for @entity27 it was beginning to shape up into a long night			2
@entity16 striker @entity209 unleashes a header at goal during the first half of the @entity18 fourth round replay @entity10 's @entity66 , who used to play for @entity16 , beats @entity42 in the air @entity10 's @entity0 goes to the ground to tackle @entity16 's @entity230 midfielder @entity50 @entity10 midfielder @entity63 tries to skip away from @entity16 's @entity166 defender @entity21 @entity16 's @entity166 winger @entity126 tries to break down the @entity10 defence sir @entity233 used to claim he instructed his @entity10 teams not to ‘ humiliate ’ lower - league opposition at home but there was not much chance of @entity237 delivering similar instructions			1
it has , after all , been a while since this @entity10 team took anybody apart			2
other chances came and went as the game meandered on and @entity57 saved spectacularly from @entity47			0
with 17 minutes left , however , he could do nothing as @entity10 substitute @entity29 fired an accurate , low shot from 20 yards			1
@entity0 did eventually manage an effort on target for his team — @entity40 fielding a header as the game approached its conclusion			0
the @entity27 striker ’s night , though , ended with a neat pass through to @entity64 in injury time , his team - mate shooting wide			1
@entity0 ’s best contribution of the whole match was rather more accurate than his first .			0

@entity16 move into the fifth round of the @entity18 with win over @entity10
@entity237 's side see off @entity27 3 - 0 at @entity19 in fourth round replay on tuesday
@entity20 and @entity21 scored in the first half before @entity29 added a third
@entity10 will face a trip to @entity271 in the fifth round on monday 16 *february*
