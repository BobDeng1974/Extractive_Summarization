a virus that starts off like the common cold could be responsible for leaving more than 100 children with paralysis			1
last summer , more than 1,000 children and teens across the country were hospitalized with symptoms that appeared to be caused by a particularly nasty strain of enterovirus			1
while some of the children showed only minor symptoms of the virus - such as runny nose , sneezing and coughing - others suffered weakness of the limbs to complete paralysis doctors caring for the sick children connected the illness early on to a pathogen called enterovirus d - 68			2
a new study published on monday has strengthened the connection between enterovirus @entity26 and the sudden paralysis of more than 100 children in the last year a new study published monday in the journal @entity31 backed those initial opinions , after following the progress of 25 children in @entity35 and @entity36 who experienced paralysis			1
enteroviruses are a type of virus that use a single strand of @entity42 to replicate themselves inside the cells of mammals			0
among other enteroviruses are polio , the virus that causes @entity48 along with others that cause a range of respiratory illnesses			2
@entity53 is among the most recently idenfitied and was first spotted in @entity35 in 1962			0
it can cause mild to severe respiratory illness and is likely to be spread by inhaling virus particles when an infected person coughs , sneezes , or touches a surface			0
in previous years only small numbers of @entity62 infections have been reported but that has increased during 2014 , according to the @entity64 and @entity65			2
it has caused severe illness in a number of children and has even been implicated in some deaths			2
the incidence of infections has fallen off considerably since october but public health officials warn that infections seem to spike during the late summer and autumn			0
researchers now suggest that the children were infected with a mutated form of @entity77 , which first appeared four years ago			1
@entity78 has five to six coding differences that make it different from other strains commonly found in the @entity82 , and that these differences cause nerve - damaging symptoms similar to polio			1
and like polio , the nerve damage appears to be permanent - since none of the children have fully recovered			1
' this is starting to look more like polio unfortunately where the paralysis appears to be permanent or semi-permanent			2
this is why there is such an urgency for more research to investigate this ' researcher @entity95 , an associate professor at the @entity96 , said according to the @entity97			0
however , the study has not definitely proved the connection between @entity78 and the paralyzed children , since researchers could not find the strain in the patients ' spinal fluid			1
the researchers however , theorized that that was because the samples were taken too late			2
' this is a virus that causes the common cold , ' @entity95 told @entity111			0
' parents do n't bring their kids in until they are really sick			0
by that time , typically , the viral levels may be very , very low or undetectable			0
' they looked for other viruses , bacteria , fungi and parasites that also could have caused the symptoms but none were present			0
researchers were also not able to answer another mystery of the enterovirus - why some children only came down with minor symptoms and others lasting paralysis			1
included in the study were two siblings that both came down with an 100 per cent genetically - identical strain of the virus in the past year			1
one of the siblings experienced paralysis while the other only suffered upper respiratory symptoms			0
with enterovirus season just a few months away in late summer , researchers are saying it 's extremely important that more work be done to unravel the @entity78 mystery and make grounds to develop a vaccine to fight the dangerous virus			1
@entity147 continues to monitor the patients infected with enterovirus , and have even set up a special clinic for the victims .			0

researchers now believe mutated strain of enterovirus @entity155 caused more than 100 children to suffer sudden paralysis in the last year
the @entity78 strain first popped up four years ago and has coding differences that make it similar to polio
none of the children monitored in the new study have fully recovered - suggesting the paralysis is permanent
