by @entity0 published : 17:31 est , 7 october 2013 updated : 09:26 est , 8 october 2013 angry : @entity1 blasted the terms ' chick - lit ' and ' women 's fiction ' for needlessly categorising texts it has become one of the publishing world ’s most popular genres			1
but do n’t label @entity1 ’s books as ‘ chick lit ’ - it makes her ‘ really angry ’			1
the author , 54 , also criticised the use of the label “ women ’s fiction ” by publishers - and said having fiction prizes for women was ‘ an anachronism ’			1
she said women are ‘ proving themselves as writers ’ and there it was no longer necessary to have a ‘ special place ’ to celebrate their efforts			1
‘ there is n’t a need , ’ she said			0
‘ maybe it ’s going too much the other way , maybe there should be men ’s prize			1
’ she said the label “ women ’s fiction ” was championed by marketing teams at publishing houses but that she disagreed with her work being put into that category			1
‘ i do n’t see myself like that , ’ she said			0
‘ my books are full of civil wars and disease and people dying - it ’s not really “ women ’s fiction ”			1
’ mrs @entity1 , who is married to @entity45 editor @entity44 , said she believed the term came ‘ partly from a desire to somehow make bookshops more manageable ’			0
‘ we have crime , we have erotica - there ’s always a desire to split and categorise and give titles			1
but “ women ’s ” is 50 per cent of us ...			1
we do n’t have “ men ’s ” fiction , ’ she said			1
speaking to an audience at the @entity59 , she said : ‘ i personally really get angry when somebody describes my work as “ chicklit ”			1
‘ it can be very annoying for a writer to be described as something when they just want to be a writer			0
’ she blamed publishers ’ marketing departments for spreading the term			1
‘ we do n’t really have control at the marketing end of things			2
as writers we do n’t necessarily have a choice , ’ she said			0
‘ it ’s the people who want to sell our books			0
’ but she added she did not imagine the situation changing in the future			0
‘ i do n’t think women are going to rise up and say “ take our names off the cover , we do n't want to be seen as women ” , ’ she said			1
mrs @entity1 also explained that she did not consider audience when she sat down to write a novel			0
‘ when i ’m writing i do n’t think i ’m writing for women at all , i do n’t think about who i ’m writing for			2
‘ i think it ’s something that happens a little bit down the line			0
’ @entity93 with husband , private eye editor @entity44 , who attended her talk , and children , @entity99 and @entity100 she revealed her literary heroine was @entity100 , the author of @entity102 , because she treated ‘ place as a character ’			1
but she added : ‘ the writers i would love to write like but would n’t dream of emulating are men			2
’ she listed @entity107 , @entity108 and @entity110 author @entity109 as her favourites			2
she appeared at the festival alongside author @entity113 , who agreed ‘ it was not essential ’ to have special prizes and categories for women writers			1
one of miss @entity113 ’s works features in mrs @entity1 ’s new collection of 100 short stories by women , @entity122			2
the collection focuses on ‘ love , loss and lives of women ’			2
mrs @entity1 said she preferred short stories written by women because they ‘ go straight to the heart of emotion more easily ’			2
but she added her decision to compile the collection was ‘ partly pragmatic ’ and she hoped a collection of men ’s short stories would follow			2
' when i 'm writing i do n't think i 'm writing for women at all , i do n't think about who i 'm writing for , ' she said she added : ‘ there ’s no doubt women and men write differently			1
i do n’t think either necessarily write better , but they do write differently			0
’ mrs @entity1 added it had ‘ never even crossed her mind ’ to include her own work in the collection			0
she is best known for her bestselling first novel , @entity146 , which is set in @entity147			0
the book sold over a million copies and was the @entity151 and @entity150 2006			0
mrs @entity1 worked in publishing and journalism before becoming an author			0
she has two children with husband @entity44 , who is a panellist on the long - running @entity157 show @entity156			0
mr @entity44 was in the audience at the festival to support his wife .			0
