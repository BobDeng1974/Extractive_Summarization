girl in the dark by @entity1 has had to endure since 2005			1
she was enjoying a successful career as a civil servant , a new flat , a thriving social scene — and then her life was knocked sideways			2
one day , she noticed that , when she sat at her computer , her face burned			2
within a year , her entire body had developed a mysterious sensitivity to light , with no diagnosis and , therefore , no likelihood of a cure			1
this is an extraordinary memoir of horror , endurance , resourcefulness and despair			1
it is also a love story — because without her boyfriend ( now husband ) @entity50 , it is impossible to see how @entity1 would have survived			1
their relationship was relatively new when her problems began and , realising she could no longer live alone , @entity1 asked if she could move into his house			1
they plan one wedding , call it off ( for medical reasons ) , then get married in 2007 , at the end of a december day			0
she writes , ‘ my love has saved me ’ , yet feels torn between her need for @entity50 and the knowledge that ‘ i am sucking the light from @entity50 ’s life , leaving him a twilit , liminal creature , single yet not single , who at social events sits alone among couples , a strange absent presence always at his side ’			2
she wrestles with the knowledge that she is ‘ occupying this lovely man , while giving him neither children nor a public companion nor a welcoming home ’ — but she sets that gloomy truth against their mutual love : ‘ the miracle which i live with , every day			0
’ @entity1 structures the memoir with inventive skill , in a series of short chapters that flash backwards and forwards , so that , sometimes , you lose your sense of time — just like the narrator , imprisoned in her dark room			1
the detail can be full of gallows humour			0
in october 2005 , @entity1 is travelling by train to see a dermatologist , ‘ wearing a dark red coat , an oversized hat with a big peak and a mask			1
cut from a dark red satin scarf , using a double layer for improved light protection			2
’ the woman opposite her glares suspiciously , and then ‘ picks up her child and walks to the other end of the carriage ’			0
remember , this is just three months after the 7/7 bombings and , masked like @entity114 , @entity1 looks bizarre			1
such episodes are entertaining — even as they make you catch your breath in empathy			0
@entity1 enjoys talking books ( the more exciting the better ) , but listening to music is too heart - breaking — even though both her parents were professional musicians and she plays the piano herself			1
the list of all the alternative therapies she has tried is almost funny			0
at one point , a healer has the nerve to tell her there can be ‘ a benefit to having an illness ’ — and the girl in the dark wants to leap up ‘ and smash the woman in the face ’			0
she points out , very wisely , that some people have ‘ an obsessive need to find meaning and pattern in human lives ’			0
they can not accept that something so randomly terrible can happen to another human being — whereas , of course , the proofs of ‘ casual brutality ’ come every day			0
yet the sheer joy @entity1 finds in a thoughtful present from her husband ( a draught excluder in the shape of a funny sheep with long , spread legs ) , as well as the wisdom accrued from her ordeal , is evidence of that power within the human spirit that keeps hoping — with every breath			1
girl @entity159 is beautifully written			0
the author ’s intelligence shines on every page , and her will to survive ( despite those black thoughts in her dark room ) is inspiring			2
the miracle of the girl in the dark is the generosity that illuminates the lives of others by sharing her story .			0
