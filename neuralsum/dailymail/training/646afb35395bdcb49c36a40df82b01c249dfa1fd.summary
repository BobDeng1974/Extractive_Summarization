the internet almost collapsed under the weight of the numerous meme 's created in honor of him as he became universally known as the @entity16			1
now 19 months - old and living at the @entity18 in @entity19 , this is the first time that @entity4 has been seen since last year - as he passes his time alone playing with his @entity21 stuffed toy as he ' learns to be a monkey again			1
' twelve months on : @entity4 the @entity3 macaque is making progress at the @entity18 in @entity19 since he was catapulted to global fame as the @entity27 up until the day that he escaped his human mom , @entity28 , @entity4 had spent most days dressed in snazzy clothes and a diaper , traveling everywhere with her			1
taken into the custody of the sanctuary the day he was found inside the @entity16 store , @entity4 's rehabilitation has been tough			1
' when he came to us , he was lacking in confidence and unsure how to act around other monkeys , ' said @entity38 , chair of the sanctuary ’s board of directors in an interview with the @entity42			2
' through being able to see and interact with the other guys , he ’s growing into a healthy , confident adolescent			2

' i just need to win him back			0
i just need him to be back home			0
' sadly since his re-housing , @entity4 has not be introduced to other primates at the sanctuary because they did n't want to run the risk of being liable to @entity28 if he was attacked			1
however , that decision may cost @entity4 the opportunity to ever safely interact with members of his own species			1
' currently , we ’re not sure about that , ' said @entity38			0
' of course , we would love to have a partner for him to interact with			0
' motherly ? @entity7 animal control officials originally claimed @entity56 abused @entity4 , even threatened to remove his teeth , but have since dropped those charges monkey business : the real estate lawyer took @entity4 with her to the office , left , and dressed him up in a devil costume for @entity96 , right , deadly : experts say it is not only illegal to have a monkey for a pet , but also could be dangerous because rhesus macaques like @entity4 can carry the herpes b virus however , in one sign of progress , @entity4 is able to see other macaques and has been mimicing their noises			1

in december last year , @entity4 captured worldwide attention after he somehow let himself out of a parked car and ambled around the @entity6 parking lot dressed in a stylish shearling coat and diaper			1
in september , @entity133 judge @entity132 ruled that while the monkey may have worn clothing and slept in his former owner 's bed , he is still a wild animal and therefore should not be returned to her			2
close ties : the mother of two said her relationship with @entity4 started out as a baby - sitting gig but turned into ' fatal attraction ' after she was unable to return him to the breeder because he was crying for her heavy burden : @entity56 explained that caring for a monkey is very demanding because he needs to be bottle fed and that @entity4 has ' anxiety disorders ' animal kingdom : besides @entity4 , @entity56 also has a pet macaw , which unlike the primate , is legal to own in @entity19 @entity56 's lawyer 's office said she would not be commenting on the decision that left her distraught			1
allegations she physically abused the monkey were dropped earlier in the year			2

@entity4 was taken to @entity18 where he has been living ever since was picked up at the @entity6 in @entity7			1

political adviser : on this occasion the famous macaque helps out @entity7 's mayor @entity183 ‘ i think when i had my two children i did n't have time to mother them			1
i was more focused on building my practice , ’ @entity56 said on the stand , according to @entity185			0
‘ having @entity4 ... was like the chance to experience motherhood again			1
’ at this trial @entity56 reportedly broke down repeatedly and told the court @entity4 has ‘ anxiety disorders ’ and that she took him everywhere she went			2
‘ i treated him like a son			0
it sounds bizarre to some people , but that ’s how we treated him , ’ @entity56 said			0
on the other side of the debate were @entity203 who contended that @entity4 could be a threat to public safety			2
@entity208 supervisor @entity207 also testified to the fact that it is illegal to keep a monkey within the city of @entity7 , but that @entity4 ’s case has prompted the city to consider changing the law			1
internet star : @entity4 is superimposed as a @entity218 figure in touch with @entity220 @entity56 said the monkey was near her at all times , including while she slept and showered			2
‘ at the beginning , i was told that was the best for him because generally , monkeys live off the back of the mom , ’ she said			0
‘ he always had to be within my view , ’ she continued , adding that he would ‘ get into a panic attack ’ the moment she was out of sight			0

@entity243 : @entity4 becomes part of an internet meme based on the @entity247 film ‘ he is more than a handful : needs to be baby bottle fed night time and needs at least 3 diaper change a day , ’ @entity56 wrote in the comments			2
‘ he has to be with me all the time which means he goes with me to the office , sleeps with me , eats with me , showers with me , goes shopping with me			0
it is more than a human baby so yes , not everyone can handle a baby monkey			0
he is now 6 months old only and is expected to be around 4 feet tall			2

@entity4 launched to global fame exactly one year ago today when he was found wandering around a @entity7 @entity16
he was taken to the @entity18 in @entity19
his owner launched a *bitter* legal battle to gain custody of him - which failed
he is now 19 - months old but sadly lives on his own because he was kept away from other macaques *due* to the legal battle with his owner
his best friend is a *purple* @entity21 doll
