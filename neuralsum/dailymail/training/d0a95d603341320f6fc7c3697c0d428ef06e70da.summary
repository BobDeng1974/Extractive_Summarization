what appears to be the first ' true - colour image ' of comet @entity2 has been revealed by @entity5 scientists			1
and in a surprising twist , rather than being the ' charcoal black ' that @entity8 expected , the image suggests the ancient comet is in fact a dusty red			1
up until now , all of the spectacular images of the comet seen by the public have been taken by @entity5 's @entity17 , which can only capture images in grey - scale			1
up until now , most of the spectacular images of the comet have been released in gray - scale but the latest image , which is being described as ' true - colour ' by @entity32 , reveals what the comet would look like if it was to be viewed by the naked eye			1
the image is due to be released at the @entity24 meeting in @entity25 on december 15			1
it was taken by an instrument dubbed @entity27 , which is a dual imaging system operating in the visible , near infrared and near ultraviolet wavelength ranges			0
while it does n't have colour sensors , it does have filter wheels to allow engineers to select of imaging wavelengths in red , green and blue			0
' darker than coal : in september , the @entity49 instrument on @entity5 mapped the comet 's surface , recording the first far - ultraviolet light spectra of the comet 's @entity55 the data , the @entity49 said the comet is unusually dark - darker than charcoal - black - when viewed in ultraviolet wavelengths			1
pictured is an artist 's impression of what they believed it may look like each photo can then be combined to create a ' true colour ' image			1
the latest image is blurred because the comet moved between exposures			2
a summary accompanying the image says : ' will discuss the colour variegation observed on the comet surface and its relationship to surface morphology and cometary activity '			2
according to @entity80 , this suggests the image is a colour composite made to emphasis various features on the comet 's surface , rather than being ' true colour '			1
in september , the @entity49 instrument on @entity5 mapped the comet 's surface , recording the first far - ultraviolet light spectra of the comet 's surface			1
from the data , the @entity49 said the comet is unusually dark - darker than charcoal - black - when viewed in ultraviolet wavelengths			1
back from the dead : @entity93 ( pictured ) broke hearts earlier this month when , in its dying moments , it managed to send back valuable data from comet @entity97 – @entity98 @entity93 broke hearts earlier this month when , in its dying moments , it managed to send back valuable data from comet @entity102			2
but , all is not lost			0
@entity5 engineers claim the plucky probe could come back to life as soon as march next year , as comet @entity102 gets closer to the sun. the probe is currently receiving an hour of sunlight during the comet 's 12 - hour day , with its batteries frozen in temperatures of -170 ° @entity114 in a recent @entity117 ' ask me anything ' session , engineers at mission control said : ' @entity93 needs to be heated until we can think of starting to charge the battery			2
the batteries were meant to be recharged by solar panels , but because @entity93 hopped a couple of times after the first touchdown , it ended up in shadow			0
' it is like trying to power your house with solar panels when you live in @entity135 just below the @entity136 during the winter , ' said @entity138 , @entity93 systems engineer			0
engineers claim the seasonal change toward spring in @entity93 's hemisphere will bring the probe into much more sunlight over the next few months			0
that , coupled with the fact that the comet is getting closer to the sun , should warm up the batteries enough to keep them charged			0
@entity149 , manager of the @entity93 lander , added that he was ' very optimistic ' that it would soon wake up			0
the amount of science that the team will be able to do will depends on how long it takes to recharge the batteries , he said			0
' we 're a bit surprised at just how unreflective the comet 's surface is and how little evidence of exposed water - ice it shows , ' said @entity163 , @entity49 principal investigator at the time			2
this finding contradicts this latest picture of comet @entity167 , and @entity8 has yet to confirm whether this is a ' true colour ' image			1
for several months , there has also been controversy over why colour images , and other data , from @entity5 's comet have been kept behind closed doors			1
' the scientists who develop the instruments that are put on @entity5 have the right to use the data for their own purposes for six months – we have difficulties to even get pictures from them , ' @entity176 , @entity5 mission director told @entity185			2
' after six months , they will be open to the science community			0
but they are very , very cautious			0
' mr @entity176 says , ' there must be something big ' in the image which has caused the secrecy up until now			0
he believe data from @entity5 could help explain how the solar system formed 4.5 billion years ago			0
there has also been some controversy over why colour images of @entity5 's comet have been kept behind closed doors			1

an artist 's impression of @entity5 and @entity102 are pictured			0

up until now , images of the comet seen by the public have been taken in the grey - scale using @entity17
the image will be released at the @entity24 meeting in @entity25 on december 15
@entity8 has yet to confirm if this is ' true colour ' or if the colours were used to *highlight* *geographical* features
scientists had *previously* said comet was ' blacker than charcoal ' following data from the @entity49 instrument
there has been some controversy over why such colour images of the comet have been kept a secret
