help is at hand : the £ 200 over-the - counter medical device is a vibrator ( white object pictured ) that aims to desensitise the penis as part of a six - week training programme - it also comes with a lubricant the @entity56 was invented by @entity2 doctor dr. @entity57 to provide what he describes as a ' practical , affordable and effective solution for men looking to learn to control their climax , delay time to ejaculation and improve their sexual confidence and sexual satisfaction '			1
it was brought to the market jointly by @entity67 and @entity68 , a @entity2 psychotherapist , as an alternative to psychosexual therapy , which they say can be time consuming , emotionally demanding and expensive , costing between £ 600 and £ 4,000			2
the makers say the benefits of @entity17 programme are that it works instantly , has no side effects and offers a permanent solution			1
but does it really work ? in a @entity82 teaching hospital run clinical trial , 61 per cent of men reported lasting 11 times longer during intercourse after using @entity17			1
in @entity85 , a further trial demonstrated an improvement of 72 per cent in lifelong sufferers of premature ejaculation with no side effects and continued improvement six months later			1

' premature ejaculation is an issue lots of men experience at one time or another , and avoiding addressing the issue only leads to sufferers feeling further isolated			0
' the @entity17 training programme is a lasting , affordable solution that has been developed , researched and refined to help the seven million men in the @entity15 , who struggle with early or premature ejaculation			1
' claims to treat the problem by desensitising the most sensitive parts of the penis just enough to allow sufficient control over ejaculation thus delaying climax for a reasonable period of time			2
to do this , it uses a discreet hand held device as part of a six - week training programme			0
the device is used three times a week in conjunction with the start stop technique			2
users place the device just under the head of the penis then stimulate the penis			0
once they reach the point of near - climax , they stop before ejaculating by removing the device from the neck of the penis			0
this exercise is repeated twice more – with completion to ejaculation the third time if desired ( as stated , this full process is completed three times a week )			2
the process is the opposite of masturbation as it aims to not allow ejaculation .			0
