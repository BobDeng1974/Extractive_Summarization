airborne surveys of the @entity1 appear to have found a puzzling new source of greenhouse gas - methane seeping directly from the @entity1 a report in @entity5 suggests that as well as huge ' surges ' of methane being released by melting permafrost , the gas might be being released from the ocean itself			1
methane is a potent greenhouse gas - and this unpredictable effect makes the climate puzzle even more complex			1
as more glaciers and permafrost melt , the effect could become even more severe ' uncertainty in the future atmospheric burden of methane , a potent greenhouse gas , represents an important challenge to the development of realistic climate projections , ' say the scientists			2
' the @entity1 is home to large reservoirs of methane , in the form of permafrost soils			1
furthermore , methane is produced in the surface ocean and the surface waters of the @entity1 are supersaturated with respect to methane			1
' until now , it had been unknown what happened to this oceanic methane			2
now it seems that some at least is being released into the atmosphere - causing unknown and unpredictable effects on the environment			0
' the fate of this oceanic methane is uncertain , ' say the scientists			0
' we use airborne observations of methane to assess methane efflux from the remote @entity1 , up to latitudes of 82 ° north			1
the methane near the surface of the ocean is not accompanied by carbon monoxide - indicating that it does n't come from man - made combustion processes			1
@entity56 @entity55 : the melting of ' permafrost ' under the sea has led to huge releases of methane - far more abrupt and intense than anything on land ' we estimate that sea – air fluxes are , comparable to emissions seen on the @entity55 shelf			2
we suggest that the surface waters of the @entity1 represent a potentially important source of methane			1
' ' while working out the past history of climate change is relatively straightforward ( especially for the past fifty to one hundred years , for which we have direct measurements ) , predicting its future is more difficult – and one of the uncertainties is the role of the potent , but less - common greenhouse gas , methane , ' said @entity82 , which reported the research			1
it 's already known that methane is being released into the atmosphere - both from the @entity55 permafrost , and , as more recently discovered by survey ships , from the sea bed			2
a @entity91 research ship recently made a terrifying discovery - huge plumes of methane bubbles rising to the surface from the seabed			1
' we found more than 100 fountains , some more than a kilometre across , ' said dr @entity99 , ' these are methane fields on a scale not seen before			0
the emissions went directly into the atmosphere			0
' earlier research conducted by @entity99 's team had concluded that the amount of methane currently coming out of the @entity108 is comparable to the amount coming out of the entire world ’s oceans			0
now @entity99 thinks that could be an underestimate			0
the melting of the arctic shelf is melting ' permafrost ' under the sea , which is releasing methane stored in the seabed as methane gas			2
these releases can be larger and more abrupt than any land - based release			0
the @entity108 is a methane - rich area that encompasses more than 2 million square kilometers of seafloor in the @entity1			1
methane bubbles trapped in ice : normally , bubbles from the seabed turn into carbon dioxide before reaching the surface , but the @entity108 is so shallow the methane travels directly into the atmosphere ' earlier we found torch or fountain - like structures like this , ' @entity99 told the @entity135			1
' this is the first time that we 've found continuous , powerful and impressive seeping structures , more than 1,000 metres in diameter			0
' ' over a relatively small area , we found more than 100 , but over a wider area , there should be thousands of them			0
' @entity99 's team used seismic and acoustic monitors to detect methane bubbles rising to the surface			2
scientists estimate that the methane trapped under the ice shelf could lead to extremely rapid climate change			0
current average methane concentrations in the @entity1 average about 1.85 parts per million , the highest in 400,000 years			1
concentrations above the @entity108 are even higher.the shelf is shallow , 50 meters or less in depth , which means it has been alternately submerged or above water , depending on sea levels throughout @entity161 ’s history			0
during @entity161 ’s coldest periods , it is a frozen arctic coastal plain , and does not release methane			0
as the planet warms and sea levels rise , it is inundated with seawater , which is 12 - 15 degrees warmer than the average air temperature.in deep water , methane gas oxidizes into carbon dioxide before it reaches the surface			1
in the shallows of the @entity108 , methane simply does n’t have enough time to oxidize , which means more of it escapes into the atmosphere			0
that , combined with the sheer amount of methane in the region , could add a previously uncalculated variable to climate models .			0

methane detected near surface of @entity1
makes warming predictions even more difficult
gas is not accompanied by carbon monoxide - so does n't come from man - made combustion
