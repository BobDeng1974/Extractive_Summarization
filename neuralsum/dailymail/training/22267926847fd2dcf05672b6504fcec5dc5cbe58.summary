by @entity0 police in @entity2 are being given three years to get their fitness up to scratch plus free doctors trips in a bid to combat the rise of overweight officers			2
@entity2 police commissioner @entity8 has promised to help his staff get into shape so that they can pass the new fit for duty tests every two years from 2017			1
in a bid to battle the bulge amongst the ranks , any officer that is found to be unfit after the fitness test will be sent to see dieticians , sport psychologists and health counsellors – for free			1
fit for duty : every @entity2 police officer will have to undergo a new fitness test , seen here , from 2017 fighting fit : @entity26 has already completed the fitness test after trying it out			1
in the photo on the right he is shown testing the ' remove the problem station ' which measures officers ' ability to carry evidence ' by paying for them to go to the doctor , it perhaps helps identify issues that they need to take responsibility about themselves , ' commissioner @entity8 told the @entity42			1
but the @entity43 says free doctors ' trips are not enough – they also want tax deductions on gym memberships and rostered exercise time for their staff			1
previously , @entity2 officers have only had to pass a fitness test while training at police academy			2
however , in three - years ' time ' everyone from the most junior constable to the commissioner of police ’ , will have to prove their health , commissioner @entity8 said			1
fighting the flab : @entity2 police commissioner @entity8 has promised to improve the fitness in his force under control : the control the problem station simulates a physical take down and subsequent cuffing procedure the tests will involve all the normal things you would imagine police should already be able to do , including tasks such as climbing over and crawling under fences			1
@entity70 , a 200m foot chase and cuffing a ' violent offender '			0
the @entity43 has raised concerns about ' what processes will be put in place to assist police to get to and maintain the required fitness level '			2
they want to know whether police will be given rostered time to achieve the fitness goals and if there will be any ' financial incentives for members to pass the test '			1
in an article in the @entity87 they explained that they want to know ' what officers may be able to claim as a tax deduction ( such as gym membership and sporting equipment ) , and the specifics of the exemption policy and how it will be handled '			2
on top of it : participants bring the takedown dummy to the ground twice on each side of the body , then safely cuff the @entity103 ensuring the handcuffs are double locked			0
timing stops once the @entity103 is rolled into the recovery position get to the problem : this test station simulates a 200m foot chase			0
it includes changing direction , jumping a 1.5 metre ditch , negotiating a doorway , climbing and descending stairs , negotiating knee high ( 50 centimetre ) hurdles , clearing a fence , and crawling through a narrow space			0
participants complete four laps of the course in a ' figure 8 ' pattern			0
on the first two laps , participants climb over a 1.5 metre fence , and on laps three and four crawl through a crawl space they said these issues have not been addressed yet so no policy has been implemented			0
the article goes on to explain how @entity132 was the first state to bring in a fitness test			0
' their test includes a beep test , push ups , a swim , and a speed and agility test ... and a lot of people were failing it , ' they wrote			0
@entity144 will introduce a test that is specific to their duties			0
' we obviously do n’t expect our police to chase people for kilometre after kilometre ; i suppose having that level of endurance and fitness is just not reflective of the genuine occupational requirements of the job , ' the journal said			0
the challenge : any officer that is found to be unfit after the fitness test will be sent to see dieticians , sport psychologists and health counsellors - for free but they highlighted the need for upper body strength and being nimble enough to crawl and climb			1
the first fitness tests will begin from 31 december 2017			2
commissioner @entity8 was unavailable for comment when contacted by @entity170 on monday			1
the proposed ' deployment readiness test ' is completed in three distinct stations : anyone with police powers will have to pass the test .			0

commissioner @entity8 is introducing fit for duty tests from 2017
unfit officers will be sent to see dieticians and sport psychologists for free
@entity43 want tax deductions on gym memberships
and ' financial incentives for members to pass the test '
