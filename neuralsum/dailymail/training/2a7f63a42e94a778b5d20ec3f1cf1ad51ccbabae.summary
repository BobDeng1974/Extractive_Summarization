before his attack on @entity7 , @entity9 set off a car bomb outside government buildings in @entity50 , killing eight people on july 22 last year			2

' @entity147 said on several occasions that what i had done was bestial and i got the impression from him that he saw me as a wild animal that had to be locked in and drugged at whatever cost			0
' ' has an event that has traumatised a nation also traumatised @entity147 and @entity156 to such an extent that they must be regarded as having a conflict of interest ? can two court - appointed psychiatrists that are so emotionally affected by july 22 mean that they are not able to be objective ?

that is due to be published on tuesday .			0
