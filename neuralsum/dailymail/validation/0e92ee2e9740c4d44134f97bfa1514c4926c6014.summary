the latter especially will be full of some of the greatest players in the world all trying to create something special to give their fans a reason to cheer			0
but the likes of @entity15 and @entity16 will do well to match the finish of @entity19 second division footballer @entity18 on sunday			2
the cross comes in from a fellow teammate during the @entity19 division two game at the weekend the ball is slightly behind @entity18 so he attempts an audacious scorpion kick from outside the box @entity18 makes a perfect connection which leaves the opposition back - peddling into his own net the goalkeeper can do nothing about the effort and is left crouched over the line in his own goal the goalkeeper and defender react to the wonder goal that had fans cheering in the @entity19 second division @entity40 is joined by his fellow teammates as he enjoys the celebrations for his wonder goal @entity18 , who plays for @entity44 , stunned fans when he scored a volleyed scorpion kick from outside the box against @entity47			1
the stunning effort left the opposition goalkeeper back - peddling into his own net , but there was no way he was keeping it out			1
it was a goal fit enough to win any game , but unfortunately it only secured @entity18 ’s side a point .			0
