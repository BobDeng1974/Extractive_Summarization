show of strength : the @entity2 army fired test missiles during a live fire exercise broadcast on state television as it continues to crackdown on its people @entity31 : the display of military manoeuvres was meant to deter international action similar to that which took place to oust @entity39 leader @entity38 the country 's main opposition group the @entity40 ( @entity40 ) said 250 people had been killed in total on monday and tuesday in ' bloody massacres ' , and that the @entity45 and @entity46 must intervene to protect civilians			1

around 70 of those shot dead were believed to be army defectors			0
critics are deeply sceptical that the agreement to allow the monitors in is anything other than further stalling as international pressure on president @entity69 grows			1
the high toll for two days of violence , among the highest since march , has reinforced that scepticism			0

manoeuvres : the @entity2 army has been ordered to attack civilians as the brutal regime ignores international calls to end the bloodshed @entity136 : demonstrators protest against president @entity69 in the @entity139 district of @entity140 autocratic : @entity2 troops using heavy machine guns and artillery killed 111 people in @entity14 in just 24 hours brutal : supporters wave flags in front of a mural of president @entity69			1
