dehydration is defined as a shortage of water in the body ¿ but the @entity4 decided the statement could not be allowed drinking water does not ease dehydration , the @entity6 has ruled – and anyone who disagrees faces two years in prison			1
the decision – after three years of discussions – results from an attempt by two @entity16 academics to test @entity6 advertising rules which set down when companies can claim their products reduce the risk of disease			1
the academics asked for a ruling on a convoluted statement which , in short , claimed that water could reduce dehydration			0
dehydration is defined as a shortage of water in the body – but the @entity4 decided the statement could not be allowed			0
the ruling , announced after a conference of 21 @entity6 - appointed scientists in @entity34 and which means that bottled water companies can not claim their product stops people ’s bodies drying out , was given final approval this week by @entity41 president @entity40			1
yesterday , @entity43 mep @entity42 said : ‘ this is stupidity writ large			2
the euro is burning , the @entity6 is falling apart and yet here they are worrying about the obvious qualities of water			2
if ever there were an episode which demonstrates the folly of the great @entity53 project , then this is it			0
’ under @entity60 law , advertisers who make health claims that breach @entity6 law can be prosecuted and face two years in jail			1
the decision was being hailed as the daftest @entity64 edict since the @entity6 sent down laws on how bendy bananas should be			1
@entity68 mep @entity67 said : ‘ i had to read this four or five times before i believed it			1
careful consideration : @entity41 president @entity40 gave final approval to the 21 scientists ' ruling this week ‘ it is a perfect example of what @entity64 does best			1
spend three years , with 20 separate pieces of correspondence before summoning 21 professors to @entity34 , where they decide with great solemnity that drinking water can not be sold as a way to combat dehydration			0
’ he added : ‘ then they make this judgment law and make it clear that if anybody dares sell water claiming that it is effective against dehydration they could get into serious legal bother			1
‘ this makes the bendy banana law look positively sane			1
’ the statement on which the eminent @entity6 experts ruled claimed that ‘ regular consumption of significant amounts of water can reduce the risk of development of dehydration and of concomitant decrease of performance			1
’ however the @entity34 gathering ruled : ‘ the panel considers that the proposed claim does not comply with the requirements for a disease risk reduction claim			2
’ it declared that shortage of water in the body was just a symptom of dehydration			0
dr @entity116 and dr @entity117 of the @entity118 and @entity119 at @entity120 said they were unhappy but not surprised			0
‘ we fear there is something wrong in the state of @entity53 , ’ professor @entity116 said			2
he added that the academics had been trying to test the working of @entity6 food and advertising rules			2
‘ it was free of charge , there was no apparent red tape attached and it gave food business operators , whom we regularly advise , a chance to advertise their products in a new way , ’ he added			0
‘ we thought we should give it a try and see what would happen			0
‘ but over almost four years , it became clear that the procedure was anything but straightforward			0
any company depending on the claim would long have gone out of business			0
what is our reaction to the outcome ? let us put it this way : we are neither surprised nor delighted			0
’ he said : ‘ the @entity41 is wrong ; it should have authorised the claim			1
that should be more than clear to anyone who has consumed water in the past , and who has not ? ’			0
