single for 13 years following a bitter divorce , @entity0 , 56 , from @entity1 , thought she would never be loved or wanted ever again			1
so when she met a ' perfect ' man named @entity5 , 62 , on an online dating site , ms @entity0 was overjoyed			1
but when , after a whirlwind romance , the couple married in what she describes as a ' dream wedding ' , she soon discovered that mr @entity5 was n't quite what he seemed			1

her story began in september 2011 , when , encouraged by friends , she decided to try internet dating and set up an account with online match - maker , @entity34			2
several men got in touch , among them mr @entity5 , whose persistent emails and seeming kindness caught her eye			1
fantastic : ms @entity0 says her wedding day was ' fantastic ' and wonderful in every way the pair began speaking regularly on the phone			1
' it felt nice to have someone phoning and having someone to talk to about all my troubles , ' remembers ms @entity0			1
' it did feel good			0
he 'd tell me about his occupation , his home , his marriage and what had happened in his marriage			2
' overjoyed : ms @entity0 was delighted when @entity12 popped the question after a few months of dating mr @entity5 was , he said , in the process of divorcing his wife of 40 years and told lurid stories about her drinking habits and vindictive behaviour			1
completely taken in , ms @entity0 agreed to meet him in person for the very first time and , despite feeling nervous ahead of the date , said it proved to be a revelation			1
' it was just nice to go out and have some real company , ' she says			0
' we had a chat and a laugh			0
' three months later , the couple decided to book a romantic weekend break in @entity79			0
' he said , " i 've got some time off and i can come down			0
do you fancy a weekend in @entity79 ? " ' i thought yeah , why not			2
he was being so nice to me so i thought yes , there is something here , i am falling for him			2
' her joy was made complete when mr @entity5 proposed and suggested taking her to buy an engagement ring the very next day			1
' i was gobsmacked at first , so i said let me think about it and i 'll let you know , ' remembers ms @entity0			1
' i was just so shocked			0
' despite her misgivings , ms @entity0 said yes and threw herself into planning her dream wedding			1
' it was a lovely time , ' she remembers			0
' i could n't knock him that way			0
he did make it special for me			0
he made it feel as if i was part of his life			0
' i was just shocked because i thought nobody wanted me			2
it made me feel safe , secure and wanted			0
' ms @entity0 had been living with her son @entity107 but at mr @entity5 ' prompting , she found a home in @entity79 for the pair to live in			1
' he was working away during the week and at weekends , he would come home , ' says ms @entity0			1
' it was nice to have my own space			0
i could do what i wanted to do during the week			0
' soon , the couple 's big day arrived			2
' i had a fantastic wedding day , from the moment i got up to when i came down and met my friends , ' says ms @entity0			1
' they all supported me , they knew what i 'd been through and it was a fantastic day			0
' but less than two weeks after the wedding , mr @entity5 , a lorry driver , began acting strangely , spending some weekends away and turning his phone off for days at a time			1
' he had these excuses like he was working in a prison , he had had to turn his phone off or his battery went flat , ' she says			0
' i thought , no , you do n't have your phone off all that time			2
but i just went along with it because i thought , maybe he is right			2
rather than have an argument , let 's just go along with it			0
' charged : @entity12 has since been prosecuted for bigamy and was sentenced to 200 hours of community service painful : ms @entity0 says in the aftermath of the break - up , she felt so low she was almost suicidal the situation continued for eight months with ms @entity0 still unwilling to confront her husband about his elusive behaviour			1
then , one day , a letter arrived			1
it turned out to be from mr @entity5 ' son who claimed he was already married and living a double life			1
when shown the letter , mr @entity5 denied everything and , for a while , ms @entity0 believed him			1
but a few weeks later , an email appeared in her inbox with the subject line : ' bigamist '			2
it turned out to be from a woman who claimed to be dating mr @entity5 and repeated what the letter had said			1
' i phoned @entity12 and a lady answered , ' remembers ms @entity0			1
' i asked if @entity12 was there and she said yes			0
' then i asked her who she was and she said , " i 'm his wife "			0
i asked her how she could be his wife and said , i 'm his wife too			0
' heartbroken and furious , ms @entity0 demanded to speak to mr @entity5 , who finally admitted the truth about his double life			1
callously , he told her that not only did he not want to be with his wife , he did n't want to be with her either and would rather be with his mistress instead			0
moving on : ms @entity0 says she still can not understand why mr @entity5 insisted on marrying her nothing : she says she was devastated to discover that her life with mr @entity5 meant ' nothing ' to him a tearful ms @entity0 told him that she never wanted to hear from him again before slamming down the phone			1
but worse was to come			0
mr @entity5 immediately stopped paying the rent on their home , leaving ms @entity0 to be confronted by their angry landlord and given just 20 hours to pack up and leave			1
' it was devastating , ' she says			0
' it just broke my heart			0
in two weeks , i lost my husband , i lost my home , i lost everything			2
' i lost my identity because one moment i thought i was mrs , and the next minute , i did n't know what i was			2
' ms @entity0 , who remains angry about what happened to her , got so depressed that she even contemplated suicide			1
' at the time , i did n't want to live			0
i just wanted to smash my car up because i felt so low			0
' some closure came when , 12 months after the revelations emerged , mr @entity5 went on trial for bigamy and was handed 200 hours community service			1
but she remains baffled by his behaviour			0
' he could have just carried on seeing me			0
but he wanted to get married			2
he wanted to get married			2
' and the consequences of his double life have been devastating			0
' i thought i had a marriage and i did n't have a marriage , ' she says			2
' i thought i had a home , i thought i had a husband but it meant nothing			2
everything we went through meant nothing , '			0
