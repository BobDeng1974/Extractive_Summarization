if @entity1 is right and @entity3 ’s poor little players are scared to play at @entity4 , then @entity0 needs to get them up the @entity5 to @entity6 as soon as possible			1
@entity1 ’s comments are laughable and epitomise one of the biggest problems at @entity3			1
players join @entity3 for an easy ride , a quiet life			1
it ’s been happening for years			0
it ’s not a criticism of them , but @entity3 fans have been far too easily pleased over the years			1
when @entity36 scored a few and showed everyone his hilarious diving celebration he became a legend			0
@entity15 was brilliant , and so was @entity41			0
@entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 and @entity45			0
@entity47 – what a finisher ! how about @entity49 ? and @entity50 ? some great players , but not one league title at @entity3 for any of them			1
and yet they ’re all regarded as @entity3 greats			2
@entity15 celebrates after scoring for @entity3 against @entity54 in may 2013 @entity55 celebrates after @entity3 beat north @entity57 rivals @entity56 3 - 1 in the @entity58 semi-final in 1991 @entity47 takes a penalty during a @entity62 match against @entity63 at @entity4 in 1991 players know that they do n’t have to do too much to become a club legend at @entity4			1
some of them do n’t even have to win any sort of trophy			0
and so when @entity3 fans display their frustration at the ineptitude of the current team – they ’ve lost four of their last five home games in the @entity22 – @entity1 starts crying			1
he claims to be speaking on behalf of the players so we are left to assume that all the players are upset about it , the poor lambs			0
@entity1 is a player who did n’t even start on sunday because he was so useless in the previous game , and when he was due to come on as a substitute he was n’t ready			1
@entity83 ( left ) diverts in a cross to put @entity19 2 - 0 up against @entity3 on sunday and yet he is upset that the fans are expressing their unhappiness			1
spurs have n’t won the league title for well more than 50 years			0
they ’re meant to be a cup team but have n’t won the @entity58 for more than 20 years			0
they have had one season in the @entity93			0
the support of the fans has been brilliant in that time , but the side effect is that players and board members have all realised they only have to do the bare minimum , and they ’ll either be seen as heroes or the manager will be sacked			2
there is no accountability at @entity3			2
@entity3 duo @entity104 ( left ) and @entity105 both show their dejection after @entity19 went 2 - 1 up there is , however , a culture and history of underachieving			1
and a habit of getting some crucial decisions badly wrong			0
@entity3 supporters have had to live in the shadow of @entity56 for too long			1
even now when the @entity114 are as bad as they ’ve been under @entity115 , @entity3 are still some way behind			2
that must hurt @entity3 fans , and i feel for them			2
but it ’s up to the @entity3 faithful to mobilise themselves and ask serious questions			2
the fans are the true owners of the club : @entity126 , @entity127 , @entity128 , @entity0 , @entity1 and all the rest will come and go			1
generations of fans will be there for ever			0
@entity126 ( left ) and @entity0 have a chat during @entity3 ' 3 - 0 defeat by @entity135 earlier this season @entity3 manager @entity127 ( second right ) watches his side go down to @entity19 on sunday now is the time for @entity3 fans to ask what the club identity really is and in which direction it is going			1
they need to stop at nothing to find out what the ultimate goal of the club is , and how they plan to get there			0
or are @entity126 and @entity0 happy to just stay in the @entity22 and pretend to challenge ? get some answers @entity3 fans			2
otherwise you ’ll end up in @entity6 questioning your status as a big club			0
booing the players is short term and ineffective			0
@entity1 ’s empty tears are just a distraction from the real issues at this underachieving club			1

@entity1 *blasted* @entity3 supporters for booing the team
the @entity4 club lost 2 - 1 at home to @entity19 on sunday
players know they do **n't** have to do much to become a legend at @entity3
@entity127 *'s* side have lost four of their last five home league games
@entity1 did **n't** even start on sunday because he was so useless in the previous game
