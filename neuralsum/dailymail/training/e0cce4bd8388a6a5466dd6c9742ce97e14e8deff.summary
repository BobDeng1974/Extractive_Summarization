throwing up : woods , who said he was on antibiotics to battle a bug that had observers wondering if he could start , let alone finish , the round , could barely speak after playing a quick 18 woods , ranked 24th , would like to challenge @entity104 at @entity105 in april as the current world number one tries to win his third consecutive major and complete a career grand slam			1
