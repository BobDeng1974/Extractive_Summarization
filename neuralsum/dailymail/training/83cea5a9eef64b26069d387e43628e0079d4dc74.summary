re-usable toilet water : the airport 's design reduces energy consumption while rainwater is recycled in toilets and used to water indoor plants boom years : the airport 's lack of commercial interest is in stark contrast to other travel hubs in @entity5 where , in the first 10 months of 2013 , passenger traffic rose 11 per cent to 297.6 million foreign interest : the boom is in part down to the industrialization of domestic travel but also thanks to increased interest from overseas the terminal resembles a giant white aeroplane covered in a perforated , honeycomb - like skin of metal and glass that admits maximum sunlight , reducing energy consumption while rainwater is recycled in toilets and used to water indoor plants			1
