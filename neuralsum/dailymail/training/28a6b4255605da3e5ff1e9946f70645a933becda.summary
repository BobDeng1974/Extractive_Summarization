@entity7 , a 4 - year - old tortoiseshell , was separated from her owners @entity10 and @entity11 at an @entity13 rally in @entity14 , @entity15 , in early november			1
two months later , on @entity16 , @entity7 was found in a family ’s backyard about a mile from the @entity20 ’ house in @entity21			1

separated : @entity7 , a 4 - year - old tortoiseshell house cat , was separated from her owners @entity10 and @entity11 at an @entity13 rally in @entity14 , @entity15 , in early november reunited : two months later , on @entity16 , @entity7 was found in a family 's backyard about a mile from her owners @entity10 and @entity20 ' house in @entity21 the @entity20 cried when they saw @entity7 , who instantly relaxed when placed on mr @entity30 ’s shoulder			1
her owners are still unsure of how she found her way home			2
‘ her pads on her feet were bleeding , ’ ms @entity11 said			0
‘ her claws are worn weird			0
the front ones are really sharp , the back ones worn down to nothing			0
’ even scientists are baffled by how the house cat managed to travel nearly 200 miles back home			1
‘ are you sure it ’s the same cat ? ’ @entity44 , director of the @entity46 ’s @entity45 , told the @entity47			2
in other cases where missing cats allegedly were found by their owners weeks and months after disappearing , @entity44 has suspected , ‘ the cats are just strays , and the people have got kind of a mental justification for expecting it to be the same cat			1
’ but in addition to the unique black - and - brown harlequin patterns on @entity7 ’s fur , she also had an implanted microchip to allow people to identify her			2
‘ i really believe these stories , but they ’re just hard to explain , ’ said @entity61 , a behavioral ecologist at the @entity63			0
‘ maybe being street - smart , maybe reading animal cues , maybe being able to read cars , maybe being a good hunter			0

’ long journey : @entity7 traveled 200 miles from @entity71 back home to @entity21 dr. @entity44 says @entity7 may have gotten a lift and perhaps hid under the hood of a truck heading down @entity15 's @entity76			1
however , the condition of her paws suggests @entity7 was not driven the entire 200 miles , nor did she travel easily			1
scientists say it is more common , although still rare , to hear of dogs returning home			2
dr. @entity44 said dogs may have inherited their genetic relative wolves ’ ability to navigate using magnetic clues			0
it is also possible that dogs get taken on more family outings , and that lost dogs are more easily noticed by people along the way , scientists say			2
cats , on the other hand , typically navigate well around familiar landscapes , memorizing locations by sight and smell , dr. @entity44 told the @entity47			0
all in all though , there is little scientific knowledge about cat navigation			0
migratory animals such as birds , turtles and insects have been studied more closely			0
many of them use magnetic fields or orientation by the sun to navigate			0
holly the house cat hardly seemed an adventurous wanderer , her owners say , though her bloodline may have given her a genetic advantage			1
her mother was a feral cat that had been roaming the @entity119 ’ mobile home park , and @entity7 was born inside somebody ’s air - conditioner			1
at about six weeks old , @entity7 padded into their carport and jumped into the lap of mr. @entity30 ’s mother , ms @entity11 said			2
