by @entity0 published : 05:53 est , 12 june 2013 updated : 05:57 est , 12 june 2013 dr @entity1 , 75 , died after his trouser leg became caught in a passing car as he crossed the road in @entity5 , @entity6 a family doctor who was honoured by the @entity8 fell to his death in a freak road accident after his trouser leg became entangled in the wheel of a passing car			1
@entity13 dr @entity1 , 75 , was crossing the road to attend prayers at his local mosque when his clothing became caught under the front passenger wheel of a passing @entity19			1
dr @entity1 shouted to the driver to stop - banging his hands on the side of the car - but he fell backwards , hitting his head on the kerb , and died in hospital five days later			1
details of the tragedy emerged at an inquest into dr @entity1 ’s death where his family criticised police for their investigation			1
the @entity13 , who received an mbe in 1999 for his voluntary work , was still practising and in 2009 had received an award from then home secretary @entity39 for being one of the ' unsung heroes ' of the @entity43 community in @entity44			2
his wife , @entity46 , who was also a doctor had just retired , and two of their three children were also @entity50 , the inquest heard			2
the tragedy occurred in september last year after dr @entity1 , who moved to @entity44 from his native @entity52 in the 1960s , began his regular friday journey to prayers from his surgery in @entity5 , @entity57			1
he was on his way to @entity59 when he stepped off the pavement on @entity61 and became entangled with the @entity62 which was moving off from the junction at a roundabout			2
driver @entity65 , a school worker , was waiting to move off and told the inquest she had been looking to her right and had not seen dr @entity1 on her left			1
she told @entity69 : ' i came to a stop at the roundabout			2
i indicated to turn right and looked to the right , another vehicle indicated to go left			2
the inquest heard that dr @entity1 was at a roundabout in @entity5 , pictured , when the accident happened ' i started to set off			1
i am confident i had n’t noticed him			2
as i set off i saw him , he put his hands on the side of my car where the mirror is , below the wing mirror at the side of the car			2
he shouted " stop "			0
' he seemed to lose his balance , he seemed to fall and stumble to the ground , he was n’t at the front of the car ' he was off the footpath , he must have been standing in the road			0
' i just stopped , i had just moved slightly			0
he seemed to lose his balance , he stumbled and he fell to the floor			2
' she added : ' i did n’t look to my left			0
you give way to the right			0
it was a roundabout - you do n’t expect pedestrians to step off a pavement on a roundabout			0
it was n’t a pelican crossing			0
' she added that her wheels must only have ' turned twice ' , and that after the collision she got out of her car and saw dr @entity1			1
driver @entity65 , left , is not blamed by dr @entity1 's wife @entity46 or daughter @entity112 , for the accident another witness @entity114 said : ' he stepped off the kerb in front of the lady in the car			1
the traffic was clear and she moved gradually forward			0
' he put out his arms onto the bonnet and fell back and his head hit the road			2
i could see his trouser leg was trapped under the car			0
' police later said mrs @entity65 was not to blame for the tragedy			1
but dr @entity1 ’s daughter @entity130 , who is also a doctor , criticised the way the investigation was carried out after she discovered it had taken four weeks for the driver of the @entity62 to be interviewed			1
she said : ' the investigation process i feel has been inconsistent , incomplete and inadequate			0
it just makes me feel that the evidence available could have been better			0
despite his advanced years , dr @entity1 was still working as a family gp at this surgery in @entity5 , @entity6 dr @entity1 's wife @entity46 , left with relative , was a doctor , as are two of their three children , the inquest heard ' i was always on the back foot looking for witnesses because the key is getting them at the time			1
i ’m just so upset			0
' @entity57 coroner @entity149 returned an accidental death verdict and said : ' i believe dr @entity1 felt that he had sufficient time to cross that road			1
' the contact between mrs @entity65 ’s vehicle and dr @entity1 is accepted as being slight , the car stopped almost immediately and somehow dr @entity1 ’s trouser leg was caught underneath the car			1
' it is very difficult to say exactly how that happened but as a result he was unable to move out of the way with any degree of safety , and as a result of that he clearly overbalanced causing his fatal injury			0
' dr @entity1 was chairman of a number of a number of local community groups and a former vice-chairman of the @entity170 of the @entity172 ’s @entity171			1
after the case dr @entity1 ’s son dr @entity173 said : ' his death was not only a tragic loss for the family but the @entity52 community			1
' we bear no vengeance towards the lady involved			0
' ' at his funeral there was a quiet dignity which is how he led his life and which i hope we composed ourself the same today			0
we tried to compose ourselves in a way that he would have himself , with the same quiet dignity as my father would have wanted			0
' it is not to say that the wounds are not still very very fresh			0

dr @entity1 , 75 , of @entity5 , @entity57 , was on his way to local mosque
clothes became entangled in @entity19 driven by @entity65
he fell and hit his head and died five days later in hospital from injuries
family and police do *n't* blame mrs @entity65 for the tragic accident
