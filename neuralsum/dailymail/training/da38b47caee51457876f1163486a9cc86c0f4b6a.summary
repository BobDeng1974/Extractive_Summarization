established in honour of @entity4 legend @entity3 , who died almost eight years ago , his annual award is voted for by you			1
it celebrates the sporting genius and @entity9 spirit so beloved of ‘ @entity10 ’			1
this year you picked @entity13 ’s @entity12 — now we invite you to nominate a sportsperson for next year			0
here are some suggestions from our writers ... @entity3 began writing for the @entity18 in 1960 and worked for them for nearly 50 years @entity21 - @entity20 i would like to nominate a very modern and very proud @entity23 in @entity20 because i think @entity3 would like the cut of his jib			1
not only would @entity26 , who loved his cricket , appreciate the almost @entity29 , left - handed strokeplay and off - spin bowling , but he would like @entity20 the man			1
above all , i think @entity3 would value how @entity20 is a fantastic role model for @entity33 muslims at a time when there are such atrocities going on in @entity37 and @entity38 in the name of @entity40			1
@entity20 bats during the sixth one day international match between @entity43 and @entity44 earlier this month @entity46 - @entity45 @entity45 , for the courage to go again after a tough fight with @entity49 , not hide behind the first win			1
that gave our public a spectacular event in front of a record - breaking crowd at @entity57 and one of the most phenomenal knock - outs in the history of the prize - ring			1
all on the 40th anniversary year of @entity63 and @entity64 rumbling in the jungle , which @entity66 was so delighted to cover — and did so with customary panache			0
@entity45 knocks down @entity49 to win the @entity68 and @entity70 fight @entity4 invites you to cast your vote now @entity73 - @entity74 @entity74 defied serious illness and injury to win an emotional 800 metres @entity78 silver medal on home turf in @entity80 — 28 years after her sprinter father , @entity81 , collected the last of his five @entity78 honours			1
the @entity83 then added @entity85 silver in @entity86 and also broke the two - minute barrier for the first time in 2014			2
at a time when @entity33 female middle - distance running is thriving , @entity74 has stood out — competing with style , heart and conviction			2
it ’s amazing what you can achieve with a hole in your foot			0
@entity100 - @entity99 i remember @entity26 once describing the @entity102 as the best sporting show on earth , and how he would have loved this year ’s contest at @entity106 and having conversations with @entity85 ’s captain , @entity99			1
it would have been a mutual love - in , for the @entity111 enjoys picking the brains of sports writers			1
i can picture the pair jabbering away on all sporting topics , with a @entity117 press officer in the background looking at his watch , wondering how on earth he was going to get @entity99 to his next assignment on time			2
@entity74 celebrates winning sliver in the 800m at the @entity78 in august @entity85 @entity102 captain @entity99 get soaked with champagne by members of his team @entity128 - @entity129 having been cursorily dumped by fiance @entity130 in a phone call lasting a few minutes , @entity129 could easily have collapsed in a heap			1
her response was quite the opposite , renewing her commitment to tennis to the extent that she arrested her career slump and reached the final of the @entity140			0
she also entered the @entity141 when she was due to be married , raising money for charity			0
and all the time she managed to stay classy about her one - time partner , despite the enormous hurt			2
@entity3 would have been much impressed by the dignity and determination she showed , inside and out of the sporting arena			1
@entity129 celebrates at the finish line of the @entity141 with @entity150 2008 - @entity151 ( @entity152 ) 2009 - @entity153 ( @entity154 ) 2010 - @entity155 - hill ( @entity156 ) 2011 - @entity157 ( @entity158 ) 2012 - @entity159 ( @entity160 ) 2013 - @entity161 ( @entity162 ) @entity163 - @entity164 during 2013 it was ludicrously suggested by some that @entity164 was tarnishing his legacy by not retiring and avoiding what had become quite frequent defeats against lesser men			1
those views showed no regard or respect for @entity164 ’s deep love of his sport			0
of course he ’s a determined competitor , but that ’s only ever been part of the story			0
therefore , to see him retain that smile and joy this season while simultaneously going so close to regaining the world no 1 spot has been special			0
no - one should be wishing away his career because there might not be another one like him			2
@entity164 plays the ball to @entity188 during the @entity189 ' @entity191 - @entity190 sometimes major breakthroughs take a while and it makes them all the more spectacular when they do happen			2
@entity190 was 40 and had been running competitively for 24 years when she won her first major title — 10,000m gold at the @entity196 this summer			0
just weeks earlier this mother from @entity198 fought the might of the @entity201 distance runners to clinch 5,000m bronze at the @entity78 , having given birth to her second child @entity204 just 10 months beforehand			0
@entity190 ’s story is not only inspiring to people who love running but it gives encouragement to ordinary mothers that they can achieve amazing feats			0
not that @entity190 would think of herself in those terms — she is so humble			0
@entity190 and husband @entity213 , also her coach , are targeting a fifth @entity214 in @entity215 , with no lottery funding			0
you would n’t bet against her			0
@entity190 celebrates with the @entity33 flag after winning the 10,000m gold at teh @entity85 championships			2
