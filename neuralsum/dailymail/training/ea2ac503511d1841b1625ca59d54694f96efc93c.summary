by @entity0 more than 66 million years ago , a fearsome beast roamed the planet that was so ferocious it has been dubbed the ' chicken from hell '			0
standing 10ft tall , the creature got its name because of a chicken - like crest on its head , feathered wings , long talons , a dangerous beak and a powerful tail			1
its official name is @entity15 and palaeontologists from the @entity17 discovered three partial skeletons of the animal in ancient rocks in @entity21			1
standing 10ft tall , the @entity15 creature , illustration pictured , got its name because of a chicken - like crest on its head , feathered wings , long talons , a dangerous beak and a powerful tail			1
palaeontologists from the @entity17 discovered three partial skeletons of the animal in ancient rocks in @entity21 name : @entity15 - after a bird - like demon in ancient mythology			1
height : 10ft ( 3m ) weight : 45 stone ( 286kg ) age : the dinosaur lived around 66 million years ago			1
features : the dinosaur had a crest on its head , feathered wings , long talons , a dangerous beak and a powerful tail			1
diet : vegetation , small animals and eggs			0
found : in ancient rocks in @entity21			1
piecing the three fossils together , they found the separate parts formed an almost complete skeleton of a dinosaur			0
@entity57 , a biology postdoctoral fellow at the @entity17 , said : ‘ it was a giant raptor , but with a chicken - like head and presumably feathers			1
‘ the animal stood about 10ft tall , so it would be scary as well as absurd to encounter			2
’ @entity64 , of the @entity65 in @entity66 , added : ‘ we jokingly call this thing the ' chicken from hell , ' and i think that ’s pretty appropriate			0
‘ so we named it after @entity15 , a bird - like demon in ancient mythology			1
’ the findings , published in the journal @entity77 , describe a 45 - stone beast which roamed the @entity79 66 million years ago , at the same time as the most fearsome predator , @entity80			2
resembling a gigantic flightless bird , @entity15 had a slender neck and hind legs , similar to an ostrich			2
piecing the three collections of fossils together , pictured , researchers found the separate parts formed an almost complete skeleton of a dinosaur			0
the fossils have preserved only bones , but close relatives of this dinosaur have been found with fossilised feathers , strongly , suggesting the new creature was feathered too the fossils have preserved only bones , but close relatives of this dinosaur have been found with fossilised feathers , strongly suggesting the new creature was feathered too			0
the dinosaur was an omnivore , eating vegetation , small animals and perhaps eggs , but the scientists think it may have been built to defend itself from larger predators			0
two of the three skeletons have signs of injuries , suggesting the species was a fighter			2
one has a broken and healed rib , and the other has evidence of trauma to a toe			0
dr @entity57 continued : ‘ these animals were clearly able to survive quite a bit of trauma , as two of the specimens show signs of semi-healed damage			0
‘ whether these injuries were the result of combat between two individuals or an attack by a larger predator remains a mystery			0

@entity15 was a fighter and had a chicken - like crest on its head
it also had feathered wings , talons , a dangerous beak and a powerful tail
palaeontologists from the @entity17 discovered three partial skeletons in ancient rocks in @entity21
the animal *measured* 10ft ( 3m ) tall and weighed 45 stone ( 286kg )
