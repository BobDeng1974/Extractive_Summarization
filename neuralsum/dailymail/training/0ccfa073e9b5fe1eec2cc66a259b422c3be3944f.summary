@entity0 has been left red - faced again after a fresh security breach was discovered in the @entity3 's software the day after it released an update fixing the last one			1
the new vulnerability differs from the passcode bug fixed by the latest @entity9 update but it too gives unauthorised access to the phone 's contacts and photos			1
it emerged after the @entity16 firm released @entity17 , which put a stop to hackers who discovered a simple combination of button presses to bypass the phone 's lock screen			1
hacked : a new flaw in @entity9 has been revealed which can allow hackers access to @entity3 owners ' pictures and contacts , just a day after @entity0 released a software update to fix a previously discovered vulnerability the new lock screen bug is slightly less complicated and involves ejecting the @entity3 's sim card while using its built - in voice controls to make a phone call			1
it was revealed by @entity38 user videosdebarraquito , who posted a video detailing the procedure			0
that 's the same phone enthusiast who spread the word about the earlier exploit , again via @entity38			0
the latest video shows the exploit executed on an @entity3 but it seems the bug applies to most modern iphones , ars technica reported			0
the hack involves activating voice dialling mode from the lock screen and instructing the phone to make a call , then ejecting the sim card at just the right moment			1
that brings up the phone 's dialling pad , from where the contacts list can be accessed and , via that list , the owner 's photos			2
insecure : the phone 's contact list can be accessed and , via that , the photo gallery precaution : turning off the ' @entity71 ' feature will keep personal information safe , but if @entity73 is enabled for lock screen use the exploit does n't work either @entity75 replicated the hack on the same model phone , while @entity78 managed it on an @entity79 but not an @entity80			0
@entity3 5 users should still beware , however , since @entity84 site @entity82 claims to have carried out the hack on @entity0 's latest smartphone offering			2
@entity73 does not appear to be the culprit allowing unauthorised access to the phone , instead the exploit is carried out through @entity0 's @entity90 feature which predates the virtual assistant			1
@entity92 recommends turning off the ' @entity71 ' feature to keep personal information safe , but if @entity73 is enabled for lock screen functionality the exploit does n't work either , according to ars technica			0
the video detailing the hack was published just yesterday but has already attracted more than 120,000 views			0
@entity0 has yet to comment .			2
