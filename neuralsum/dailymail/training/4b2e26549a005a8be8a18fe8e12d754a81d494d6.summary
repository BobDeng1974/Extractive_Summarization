@entity0 is occasionally regarded as a creative way for children to keep themselves entertained , allowing them to build fantastic worlds and let their imagination run wild in a fun environment			1
but experts have warned that playing the game is actually inhibiting the imagination of children , and encourages ‘ labour ’ over ‘ love ’			1
research suggests that putting children into such ‘ structured ’ play time can affect their development - and parents need to give them more free time to let their imagination run wild			1
a @entity22 - based study says kids need more unstructured entertainment			1
it says giving children access to games and tv can inhibit their development of social skills			1
the study says games like @entity0 ( shown ) ultimately encourages ' labour ' and monotonous tasks over ' love ' and having fun in an article on @entity39 , @entity40 from @entity22 - based @entity41 and @entity42 from @entity43 explained that @entity0 can discourage imagination in children			1
‘ in @entity0 , kids can build and explore new worlds and manipulate them with unprecedented control and precision , ’ they write			2
last week @entity51 announced its biggest selling apps of the year , with @entity53 and @entity0 both topping the best - seller charts from the @entity55			2
@entity53 's dedicated chat app was the most downloaded free app for iphones in 2014 , ahead of other social networking apps @entity60 , @entity61 and @entity62			0
the official @entity53 app was also fourth in the list , while dating app @entity66 came in tenth place			0
@entity0 , the game that allows players to build their own world from scratch using the game 's signature blocks , was the most popular paid - for app for both @entity74 and @entity76 devices for the second year running			2
it beat 7 minute workout challenge on @entity74 , and @entity78 2014 on @entity76			0
the mobile version of classic console title @entity80 : @entity82 and puzzle game @entity84 also made the top 10 on both @entity76 and @entity74			0
‘ the underlying creativity is baked into the program - the combinations , tools and materials - so the players have only one task to complete : design ever more complex structures			0
’ ‘ though this seems like the pinnacle of an imaginative play experience , the kids we studied said they felt “ edgy ” and “ irritable ” after @entity0 sessions			2
’ they continued that the game , once kids have mastered it , becomes ‘ less about open - ended play and more about working to complete the never - ending stacks of buildings			0
’ what their study says is that children play the game simply to eat up time and alleviate boredom , rather than finding more imaginative ways to stimulate themselves such as playing outside or inventing their own make - believe games			1
they say that children must be given more opportunities to have ‘ unstructured ’ play time at an early age away from video games and television , so that they learn the skills to overcome frustration			1
otherwise , as found in their study , they will become irritable and confused when presented with free time , which can apparently lead to difficulties interacting with other children			0
what their study suggests is that children play the game simply to eat up time and alleviate boredom , rather finding more imaginative ways to stimulate themselves ( stock image shown ) such as playing outside or inventing their own make - believe games speaking to @entity139 , child health education specialist dr @entity136 from @entity138 agreed that there is concern at the amount of time children of a young age are spent in front of a computer or television			1
he explained that in these scenarios , children are increasingly told how have to have fun , rather than come up with ideas themselves			2
in order to properly develop their social skills with others , he says that it is imperative that children are allowed to become bored with no easy form of entertainment			1
‘ children really must be given the gift of boredom , ’ he said			2
‘ boredom and under - stimulation are two fears of modern aspirational parents , and this is a terrible misnomer			0
‘ it is absolutely necessary for children to become bored so they can learn early on how to stimulate themselves , and how to seek stimulation			0
’ he suggests that children under the age of three should not be encouraged to use television or computers at all , to allow their brains to benefit from free time			0
at higher ages he says brief exposure if okay but it is ‘ all about the amount ’ and parents should monitor closely the time they spend in front of a screen .			0
