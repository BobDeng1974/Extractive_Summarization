by @entity1 reporter published : 19:58 est , 19 july 2013 updated : 19:58 est , 19 july 2013 elected police commissioners are showing a ' worrying ' ability to evade rules when sacking chief constables , mps have warned			1
protections in place that allow police chiefs to fight their corner if they are being forced out appear to be being side - stepped , according to the @entity12 committee			0
it says the early indications are that it is ' very easy ' for a police and crime commissioner ( @entity18 ) to remove a chief constable for reasons of an ' insubstantial nature ' and even the home secretary is powerless to intervene			2
singled out : gwent commissioner @entity23 was criticised for ' persuading ' chief constable @entity24 to retire , bypassing the formal process mps warned it was further evidence that the checks and balances on @entity30 are ' too weak '			1
they were particularly critical of gwent commissioner @entity23 who ' persuaded ' chief constable @entity24 to retire earlier this year , which meant the formal process was bypassed			1
the committee said the reasons given for the decision were ' unsubstantiated by any concrete examples '			0
it also rounded on him for criticising the grilling he received about the move at the hands of @entity43 mp @entity42 , who represents the @entity44 in @entity45			0
' we were disappointed that , shortly after we took evidence from mr @entity23 , he took to @entity50 to criticise a member of the committee for asking questions that he believed had been prompted by @entity26 , describing the proceedings as ' sad really ' , ' the report said			2
mr @entity54 even described mr @entity42 as a ' plant of @entity26 '			2
this disdainful attitude towards scrutiny by @entity58 , as well as an indication of a clear over-sensitivity to criticism , from a politician elected by less that 8 % of the electorate , who had managed to side - step the statutory arrangements for local scrutiny of his decision to sack the chief constable , is further evidence , if any were needed , that the checks and balances on police and crime commissioners are too weak			1
@entity30 , which replaced existing police authorities in 41 force areas across @entity77 and @entity78 , were handed the power to set force budgets and hire and fire chief constables			1
just 15.1 % of registered voters took part in the november 2012 @entity18 election - the lowest recorded level of participation at a peacetime non-local government election in @entity88			0
concern : @entity90 said it was ' worrying ' that @entity18 seem able to side - step statutory process mps said it should ' not have come as any surprise ' that there were a number of high - profile clashes between commissioners and chief constables following the reforms			1
@entity103 chief constable @entity102 was suspended by @entity18 @entity104 but was reinstated following a @entity106 judgment that described the decision ' irrational and perverse '			2
commissioners remove chief constables by ' calling upon ' them to resign or retire but they must first give a written explanation of the reasons for the proposal and then consider any response			1
police and crime panels must make a recommendation to the commissioner within six weeks backing or opposing the plan and may consult @entity117			0
neither of the two chief constables removed had ended up going through the process , the committee said			1
@entity90 said : ' it is worrying that @entity18 seem able to side - step the statutory process for dismissing a chief constable			0
police and crime panels should make more active use of their powers to scrutinise decisions such as this			0
' ' we will be returning to this area when we carry out our next major inquiry into @entity18 , towards the end of this year			0

@entity26 warn that the checks and balances on @entity30 are ' too weak '
pccs were handed the power to hire and fire chief constables last year
