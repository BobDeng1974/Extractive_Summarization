@entity0 has been accused of a ‘ cavalier and unsympathetic ’ attitude towards @entity2 after failing to include @entity3 in a landmark @entity5 television history of the world			1
@entity7 , including @entity8 , the former archbishop of @entity9 , say the @entity5 is guilty of ‘ a glaring oversight ’ for excluding @entity11 from the series			1
@entity8 said : ‘ any historical enquiry worth its salt takes seriously the life and ministry of @entity3 when considering the impact of the @entity2 faith on world history			1
lavish : @entity20 conquers @entity21 in the @entity5 production ( pictured ) ‘ this glaring oversight confirms a widely - held suspicion that the @entity5 tends to be cavalier and unsympathetic in its treatment of @entity2			1
’ the new eight - part series – presented and written by mr @entity0 – contains only a handful of references to @entity3 and makes no attempt to tell the story of his life or to explain his teachings			1
in coming weeks mr @entity0 will visit more than 60 historic locations but none has any association with @entity3 ’s life and death			1
the omission of such a pivotal figure from the series , which is a co-production with the @entity41 , is in stark contrast to the treatment of other faith leaders			2
in tonight ’s episode , mr @entity0 visits the @entity47 town of @entity48 , a place of pilgrimage for @entity51 , to explain the origins of that particular faith			0
and next week , he tells the story of the @entity47 warrior @entity55 , who converted to @entity51 and helped spread the faith			0
the series has been written by @entity0 ( pictured ) the rest of the series charts history to the present day , focusing on figures from the conqueror of @entity21 , @entity63 leader @entity20 , to @entity64			2
the series does not sideline @entity2 but instead chooses to begin its history of the faith after @entity11 ’s death in @entity69			1
it provides an outline of the conversion of @entity73 and recreates the death of the female martyr @entity75 in 203 ad			0
bishop @entity76 , the former @entity76 , said he could not see how the @entity5 could justify the ‘ crucial omission ’ of such a ‘ central figure ’ in human history			1
he said : ‘ in the series @entity0 notes there are two billion christians in the world , but does not say why			0
it would have been good to know			0
’ last night , mr @entity0 said : ‘ i have absolutely no doubt that @entity3 was a historical figure			2
i am sure that of all the great founders of the world religions he is the most historical			0
‘ but part of the problem we face is striking that balance between stories everyone knows and giving people stories they do not know so well			0
’ mr @entity0 said the programme had decided to begin its history of @entity2 with @entity73 as he had been crucial to the transformation of @entity2 into a major religion			0
a @entity5 spokesman said : ‘ @entity0 ’s @entity104 is not a religious programme nor a history of religion			2
the series tells the story of the evolution of civilisation			0

@entity7 say the @entity5 is guilty of ' a glaring oversight ' for excluding @entity11
eight - part series contains only a handful of references to @entity3
