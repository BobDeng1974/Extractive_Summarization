laboratory beef could surpass the real thing within 10 years to solve environmental and animal welfare problems , while remaining just as tasty , a @entity1 scientist says			2
@entity5 , professor of physiology at @entity7 in the @entity1 , 18 months ago oversaw the creation of the first ' cultured beef ' burger made of stem cells from cow muscle tissue			1
he says beef producers already recognise the looming obstacles for the industry , such as how to sustainably and effectively feed the world 's population , including the growing @entity19 middle class , which is projected to reach 3.2 billion people by 2030 and to double the region 's food consumption by 2050			0
@entity5 , professor of physiology at @entity7 in the @entity1 , 18 months ago oversaw the creation of the first ' cultured beef ' burger made of stem cells from cow muscle tissue ' they recognise the same problems , probably better than anybody else , and they see there could be alternatives , ' professor @entity5 told reporters in @entity32 on friday , where he was a guest speaker at the @entity35 annual conference			1
he says consumers will eventually drive the demand for laboratory beef and producers will have to fall in line			0
initially , it will be considered a luxury product , with an appeal to those with environmental and animal welfare concerns			1
' the more traditional meat consumer , and probably also richer and younger segment , will tap into this much sooner than people in @entity50 and @entity51 , who for the first time ever can afford meat and will go for the lower cost traditional meat sources , ' he said			0
he told the @entity35 annual conference in @entity32 on friday that he predicted lab - made meat would be competing with traditional beef in about 10 years time the first cultured beef patty cost a whopping 250,000 euros , but within 10 years production could be scaled up to compete with traditional beef in cost , especially if beef prices continue rising , professor @entity5 said			1
one stem cell can make 10,000kg of beef , so the capacity is huge , he said			0
farmers will be able to adapt production systems to incorporate cultured beef , which will eventually piggyback on the industry 's resources , distribution networks and access to consumers			2
but the two forms of beef production wo n't really be able to co-exist , professor @entity5 said			0
he claimed it will initially considered a luxury product , with an appeal to those with environmental and animal welfare concerns ' if this technology produces exactly the same product with less resources and ... less animal welfare issues , then i think the consumer will eventually decide for us , ' he said			1
taste remains the biggest issue : the lab burger currently tastes ' okay , not great ' , but fat tissue is being added to improve the flavour			2
' it 's essentially the same tissue in the end , so the taste has to be similar , ' he said .			0

prediction was made by @entity1 professor of @entity99
he oversaw the creation of the first ' cultured beef ' burger made of stem cells from cow muscle tissue 18 months ago
*mr* @entity5 said lab - made meat will be considered a luxury product and appeal to people with environmental and animal welfare concerns
it is still being *perfected* by scientist who are adding fat tissue to improve taste
