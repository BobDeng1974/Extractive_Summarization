two 160 million year old fossils found in @entity1 are from the earliest known tree - dwelling and subterranean mammals ever discovered			1
with claws for climbing and teeth adapted for a tree sap diet , @entity4 is the earliest - known tree - dwelling mammaliaform ( long - extinct relatives of modern mammals )			1
the other fossil , @entity12 , is the earliest - known subterranean mammaliaform , possessing multiple adaptations similar to @entity16 golden moles such as shovel - like paws			0
the other fossil , @entity12 , is the earliest - known subterranean mammaliaform , possessing multiple adaptations similar to @entity16 golden moles such as shovel - like paws			0
the earliest mammals are thought to have appeared roughly 200 million years ago , arriving on the scene during the @entity23 with dinosaurs ruling the land and flying pterosaurs keeping an eye out for a quick snack			1
the earliest - known bird did notappear until about 150 million years ago			0
where they were found @entity4 , an omnivore that lived about 165 million years ago , possessed paws with curved claws for climbing , limb dimensions characteristic of other tree - dwelling mammals and flexible elbow , wrist and ankle joints good for scrambling up trees with agility			1
its spade - like front teeth , similar to some @entity43 monkeys today , allowed it to chew into bark and eat tree gum or sap			2
@entity47 , a mole - like insect - eater that lived about 160 million years ago , boasted shovel - like paws for digging , teeth similar to later burrowing mammals that forage underground and sprawling limbs ideal for underground movement			1
@entity55 paleontologist @entity54 called @entity47 a " dead ringer " for today 's @entity16 golden mole			0
traits in @entity47 's fingers are so similar to that mole that the researchers suspect the same genes may be responsible even though the two creatures belong to different branches of the mammalian family tree and are separated by 160 million years			0
the earliest mammals are thought to have appeared roughly 200 million years ago , arriving on the scene during the @entity67 with dinosaurs ruling the land and flying pterosaurs keeping an eye out for a quick snack			1
the earliest - known bird did not appear until about 150 million years ago			0
" before the 2000s , it was generally thought @entity67 mammals could not diversify much in the dinosaur - dominated ecosystem , " @entity54 said			2
the fossil of of @entity12 as preserved in split rock slabs with dense and carbonized furs around its skeleton @entity47 , a mole - like insect - eater that lived about 160million years ago , boasted shovel - like paws for digging , teethsimilar to later burrowing mammals that forage underground andsprawling limbs ideal for underground movement			1
but @entity54 said this notion has been undercut by discoveries in recent years of fossils of many @entity67 mammals with numerous specializations including swimming , tree - living and digging			1
" simply put , our distant mammalian relatives explored ecological niches that were just as varied and interesting as many modern mammal groups , " @entity54 said			0
@entity99 and @entity47 both belonged to a long - extinct early mammalian order called docodonts			0
@entity102 , another docodont living at about the same time in the @entity104 whose fossil was unearthed in @entity1 in 2006 , had beaver - like traits tailored for an aquatic lifestyle			2
the fossil of @entity4 , an omnivore that lived about 165million years ago @entity4 , an omnivore that lived about 165million years ago , possessed paws with curved claws forclimbing , limb dimensions characteristic of other tree - dwellingmammals and flexible elbow , wrist and ankle joints good forscrambling up trees with agility			2
the research was published in the journal @entity120			0
stem mammaliaforms ( also known as “ stem mammals ” ) are long - extinct relatives the newly discovered fossils show stem mammaliaforms had very diverse feeding and locomotor functions , and a much wider ecological divergence as a whole , despite the dominance of dinosaurs in the @entity67 .			2

fossils found in @entity1 reveal two shrew - sized creatures
represent the oldest - known tree - climbing and burrowing mammals
lived during the @entity67 with dinosaurs ruling the land and flying pterosaurs in control of the skies
