when two famous @entity2 actors agreed to pose as disabled police officers and stop people for ' speeding ' , it seemed like an innocent enough prank			1
but the charity video went horribly wrong when one of the men they flagged down suffered a heart - attack , upon hearing it was a candid camera stunt			1
the men have since claimed they intended to gauge people 's reactions to being pulled over by disabled policemen , in a bid to raise awareness			1
@entity35 , 48 , and @entity25 , 50 , were given suspended sentences in october last year for their involvement in the prank			1
a district court in the @entity2 capital @entity41 has since acquitted the actors of the crime of impersonating a police officer			1
mr @entity35 told the appeal court : ' it was not our aim [ to harm someone ] and i am really , very sorry about it			2
' i thought that we were doing something good and we thought that everything would be all right			0
' fellow actor @entity25 said : ' i agree			0
the aim was to help disabled people and we did it in good faith			0
' the charity video , which was filmed in 2012 in @entity41 , was due to air on @entity2 national television			1
the court in @entity41 initially found both actors guilty of using impersonating the police because they wore uniforms and were carrying out police activities			0
stunt : @entity35 ( left ) , 48 , and @entity25 ( right ) , 50 , dressed as police officers in a tv prank for a @entity2 television station - to gauge people 's reaction to being pulled over for speeding the charity video , which was filmed in 2012 in @entity41 , was due to air on @entity2 national television			1
they replied by pointing out that the police uniforms were not real , and they thought it was obvious it was just a sketch and not a real police action			0
mr @entity25 slammed the @entity2 television station for failing to protect them , saying : ' i would like to advise all my colleagues to take lawyers to dressing rooms of televisions or film studios			2
otherwise the same thing will happen to them			0
' and mr @entity35 followed : ' i am really sorry about it			0
i did not expect that people would n't recognise us			0
' after the verdict overturning the conviction was announced , the public gallery erupted into cheers of support from fans of the pair and family .			2
