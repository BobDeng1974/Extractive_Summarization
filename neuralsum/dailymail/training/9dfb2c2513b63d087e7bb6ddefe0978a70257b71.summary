by @entity1 reporter published : 11:07 est , 23 july 2013 updated : 11:07 est , 23 july 2013 sent anonymously to the @entity4 , this cardboard box of human remains has helped to shed fresh light on a mystery that has endured for almost 40 years			2
a note inside - from a sender identified only as ' @entity9 ' - asked the newspaper to find out who the bones belonged to , and pointed it towards the disappearance of two young couples who vanished at sea back in 1976			1
@entity16 , 24 , and his sister @entity17 , 20 , together with their respective dates @entity20 , 16 , and 26 - year - old @entity21 , set out on a fishing trip off @entity23 , @entity24 , over the @entity25 weekend , and never returned			1
lasting mystery : mailed by somebody using the name ' @entity9 ' , the cardboard box that arrived at the @entity4 offices was found to contain two human skulls the @entity32 discovered 24 - year - old @entity16 's motorboat floating partially submerged off the coast of @entity35 , with two pairs of shoes , @entity17 's purse and some soft drinks the only trace of those that had been on board			1
the boat was later found to be still seaworthy , and three life jackets and a distress flare were recovered unused			2
the foursome 's baited fishing rods were still attached to the side of the vessel			1
it was concluded that both young couples had succumbed to the icy temperatures of the @entity53 after their boat got into trouble , but the families of the missing four never gave up hope that the missing boaters would be found			1
' we feel their has been foul play , ' @entity59 , @entity16 and @entity17 's brother , told a newspaper in june 1976			1
their relatives - conscious that all four were strong swimmers - scoured the shoreline of @entity68 , before expanding their search further , giving television interviews and eventually seeking the advice of psychics as years went past with no clues			2
clues : the package included official paperwork related to the foursome 's disappearance , and a message insisting ' this is not a @entity82 prank ' a leg recovered by a fishing trawler towards the end of 1976 was still inside a high leather boot that contained @entity16 's wallet , and his family buried it in @entity90 in @entity91			1
but it was not until the mysterious package arrived at the @entity4 offices last autumn - containing remains from two humans , paperwork connected to the vanished boaters , and a note which insisting ' this is now a @entity82 prank ' - that more emerged about the foursome 's fate			1
paperwork inside the box indicated that the medical examiner suspected one of the skulls could belong to either @entity20 or @entity109 - but in the days before dna testing he had no way to be sure			1
the other set of remains were thought to belong to a native american woman			0
the remains would have been disposed of were it not for an employee at the state crime lab who decided to send them to @entity9 for safekeeping , according to the @entity4 's report			0
' please see that justice is now done for the sake of these two victims , ' @entity123 wrote			0
in the wake of the arrival of the box @entity128 and @entity4 reporters embarked on separate investigations into the disappearance of the boaters			0
hope through the years : police used dna testing to identify one set of remains as those of @entity20 , the 16 - year - old sister of @entity140 ( pictured ) , who never gave up hope that his sibling might have survived disappearance : @entity16 and @entity145 and their dates @entity20 and @entity21 vanished during a boating trip off @entity24 on @entity25 weekend in 1976 using a dna sample collected from a single tooth remaining in the unidentified skull suspected to be that of one of the missing boaters			1
in december , genetic material was collected from @entity16 and @entity17 's sister @entity156 , @entity20 's brother @entity157 , and @entity158 , sister of @entity21			0
after an agonising six month wait , investigators contacted mr @entity140 to inform him the school was that of his sister , @entity162			0
' until i got the phone call			0
i always kind of expected to see her walking down the street , ' he says after notifying the families involved , the case was closed again , but not before samples collected from the relatives of the unaccounted for boaters , @entity145 and @entity21 , were logged in a missing person 's database in case their remains should ever be unearthed			2
the other remains inside the box were found to be between 400 and 500 years old and from two different people			0
a state archaeologist is now trying to establish which @entity182 tribes the remains can be traced back to			0
efforts to trace @entity9 by both police and the @entity4 have proved fruitless			0
the family of @entity21 accepts he probably died in the boating accident , but long for the sense of ' closure ' that physical evidence has brought to the @entity20 's relatives			2
' i wish there was a way we could have put it to rest and we never did , ' @entity21 's older sister @entity192 said .			0
