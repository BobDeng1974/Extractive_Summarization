by @entity0 for the @entity1 @entity2 and @entity3 last night accomplished a task that proved beyond them in the previous 25 days — talk to one another			1
the two @entity8 men have spoken publicly — and to their engineers — about each other since the latest hiccup in relations happened at the last race in @entity14 on july 27 , when @entity2 refused to follow a team instruction to let @entity3 pass			1
@entity3 described @entity2 ’s stubbornness as ‘ not good ’ — strong words coming from @entity20 ’s @entity19			1
but @entity2 , speaking ahead of sunday ’s @entity21 , is not in a mood to apologise			1
tension : @entity2 and @entity3 are not on the best of terms currently ‘ i do n’t feel i owe him anything , ’ said the @entity26 , who is 11 points behind @entity3 in the drivers ’ championship			1
‘ i ’m not sure we need to talk			2
i was n’t really involved much in his race and he did not get close enough to overtake			1
they said do n’t hold him up , but he was never on my tail			0
‘ i made it hard for him to pass			0
‘ there was not right or wrong			0
i ’m not upset with the team and they are not upset with me			0
i like to think i handled it quite well			0
i heard someone said i defied team orders			0
‘ it ’s different when you ’re sitting in the car and someone tells you that you need to react			0
you are not in as clear a moment as when you ’re sitting here at the table			0
the team know i was right			0
’ staying quiet : @entity3 does n't want to heat up the fued anymore by adding more details @entity3 , true to his diplomatic mien , said : ‘ i gather it was a bit of a mess ( in the media ) after @entity14 so it ’s best i do n’t add too much and not give too many details			1
’ he did not excuse @entity2			1
it is difficult to apportion total blame , for while @entity2 should really follow instructions from the pit wall , the order was arguably unrealistic given the two drivers ’ proximity in the standings and , as @entity2 argued at the time , the fact that @entity3 was not right on his team - mate ’s gearbox			1
@entity76 ’s @entity75 , of @entity77 , will sit out this race because of ‘ contractual issues ’ , terminology which was widely perceived here as code for ‘ run out of money ’			2
he pays for his seat — worth an estimated £ 5million — through his father @entity85 , an insurance magnate			0
defiant : @entity2 insists he did nothing wrong by not letting @entity3 pass him @entity75 , 23 , turned up at @entity87 in a black 4x4 and posed for photos with supporters , hoping to thrash out a last - minute deal to allow him to drive			1
it was not to be , and his place will be taken , for this race at least , by @entity94 , a 21 - year - old @entity95 with @entity97 experience			2
‘ although it was not our intention to offer @entity94 the possibility to race this season , in light of the circumstances we are pleased to be providing him with the opportunity to make his debut , ’ said @entity77 team principal @entity98			2
‘ naturally we hope to resume normal service with respect to our established race driver line - up as soon as possible			2
marussia are a team without a big budget even if their owner is venture capitalist @entity116 , a @entity117 billionaire .			0

the pair have now spoken to one another for the first time since an argument at the last race in @entity14 on july 27
however they are still no sooner to *settling* their *dispute*
@entity2 remains 11 points behind @entity3 in the drivers championship
