it 's not too late to play @entity1 ! there 's £ 1,000 to be won every week by the highest - scoring manager ! as the @entity6 season gets going , @entity4 take a look at players new to the top flight with the potential to light up @entity12 's top tier over the coming campaign			1
@entity14 in a nutshell the domino effect of @entity17 taking @entity18 to @entity19 saw @entity20 seek a replacement			1
that prompted manager @entity23 to bring in a right - back by the name of @entity14			1
the 25 - year - old from @entity27 , arriving for a cool £ 5million , gave those in @entity29 a taster of what he is capable of with @entity32 at the @entity33 in @entity34			2
there , he brought his total caps to 21 since making his debut against @entity38 in september 2012			0
from @entity39 to @entity40 to the senior level under now - @entity43 manager @entity42 , @entity14 looks a player the 52,000 at @entity45 can get excited about			2
new boy : @entity32 right - back @entity14 moved to @entity20 from @entity27 for a cool £ 5million all smiles : the 24 - year - old is an attacking full - back and is expected to fit straight into @entity20 's defence looking up : @entity14 is quick and likely to excite the 52,000 at @entity45 with his overlapping runs @entity18 would cost you £ 5.1m in our @entity1 game			1
click here and start picking now ! @entity56 , @entity57 ? @entity14 is designed to replace his @entity59 counterpart , but what do the statistics say ? look away @entity19 fans - and do n't shoot the messenger - but @entity14 wins in almost every department from last season , according to @entity66 , who kindly did the math. looking at everything from passing to tackling to chances created , @entity14 scores 23.38 points compared to @entity18 's 14.69			1
he also wins in the defensive market - 9.87 to 8.99			0
@entity14 completed an average of 38.20 passes per match with an 82 per cent success rate - @entity18 made just 25.14 passes with 73 per cent finding their destination			1
assists ? five to three			0
minutes on the pitch ? 2,644 to 2,491			0
@entity18 does win the occasional battle , though			2
the former @entity20 defender wins in tackles by the skin of his teeth - 2.45 to 2.20			2
but , in doing so , he commits more fouls - 1.41 to 0.83			0
make of these what you will , but @entity14 looks the safer bet on paper			2
tackle : @entity14 ( left ) is not afraid to make a challenge and is eager to add to the attacking element of teams why pay top dollar for an overly - expensive defender when you can get @entity14 for less than £ 5m ? 1			1
£ 7m - @entity98 , @entity99 2			2
£ 6.9m - @entity100 , @entity101 3			0
£ 6.8m - @entity102 , @entity101 4			0
£ 6.7m - @entity103 , @entity19 5			0
£ 6.6m - @entity104 , @entity99 53			0
£ 4.9m - @entity105 , @entity20 but how will he get you points ? @entity14 , a rare breed of a defender , loves to get forward while also fulfilling his duties at the back			1
not only will he get you those appearances and clean - sheet points , the @entity112 will chip in with the occasional goal and assist too			0
last season , @entity14 scored twice ( that would be 10 points apiece in @entity4 's @entity1 game ) and nabbed five assists ( three apiece )			1
not a bad return for a full - back			1
it appears the @entity126 star has been given licence to do the same at @entity20 by @entity23 , so do you fancy a gamble on the attacking full - back that costs just £ 4.9m ? so , @entity131 would cost you more ? take your pick			1
@entity134 's @entity133 , @entity136 's @entity135 and @entity138 's @entity137 all cost more than @entity14			2
in the list of defenders by price , @entity14 falls 51st			0
can you afford not to pick him as a substitute ? going @entity112 : @entity14 played five times at the @entity144 in @entity34 for @entity32 under @entity42 is he experienced enough for the @entity6 ? judging by @entity34 2014 , he is			1
@entity14 had to rise through the ranks to earn that orange shirt , and did so impressively			0
@entity147 is n't the easiest man to please after all			0
not to mention , he 's confident			0
@entity14 describes his transfer to @entity20 as the ' perfect move '			1
the right - back , having also been linked with @entity152 , @entity19 and @entity43 in the past , shows no signs of weaknesses yet			2
he 's there to bridge a gap , and should do so fittingly			0
click here to @entity158 for your team ! you 're not too late ! step - up ? @entity14 has better league statistics than outgoing full - back @entity18 had last season			1

@entity14 costs just £ *4.9million* in @entity4 's @entity1 game
the @entity20 right - back is a replacement for @entity18
