by @entity0 @entity2 's pelicans follow him around the shop for hours a day they 're often @entity2 's first customers through the door and the last to leave at the end of the day , but they are n't people , they 're pelicans			1
mr @entity2 's bait and tackle shop at @entity11 , on the @entity13 mid-north coast , three hours north of @entity14 , is anything but you 're ordinary fishing store			1
not only is the @entity19 constantly inundated with keen anglers looking to buy the bait to their next catch , it 's also being overrun by some eager and inquisitive pelicans eyeing off the delicious smorgasbord of tasty treats			0
mr @entity2 said the pod of four pelicans have been walking through his door off and on ever since he began nursing an injured pelican , ' @entity30 , ' back to good health a few years ago			1
' she now follows me around the shop for hours each day , ' he said			2
' she might follow me in to the kitchen or just look outside the window to see what 's going on			0
' ' @entity30 turned up crook and i nursed her back to health			1
the 57 - year - old , whose business has become somewhat of a sanctuary for injured pelicans , also nursed a @entity52 with a clipped wing back to health which had a ' sort of grey looking texture			1
' over the years there has also been ' @entity59 , ' who had a bent nose similar to a friend of mr @entity2 's who died , and another with a broken wing he had to amputate			1
mr @entity2 said when he saw ' @entity64 ' turn up on his doorstep he thought it was a reincarnated version of his friend			2
' we thought he had reincarnated as a pelican when he came to see me			0
' a pod of pelicans walk in for a look and to escape the rain during a wet day at @entity11 on tuesday mr @entity2 's visitors often squabble over who is going to be fed first mr @entity2 , originally from @entity14 , settled in @entity11 30 years ago because he loved its laid back lifestyle , surf and was a mad fisherman			1
' we used to always holiday in @entity11 , before i started the partnership in the business with my wife			0
' ' i always liked it here , always surfed and spent a few years travelling and surfing around the place			0
' he said only in recent years has he invited pelicans to ' waltz into the shop '			2
' they 're sometimes just there waiting for me when i open the shop			2
' once through , they gaze at the smorgasbord of available baits as if looking at a menu in a restaurant waiting to be fed. ' @entity100 is their favourite			0
asked if he ever gets sick of them walking around , he said : ' they can be like a child sometimes , they 're a bit naughty '			0
' the only time i really can keep them away is with the dogs , but i can assure you i do nothing to hurt them			0
