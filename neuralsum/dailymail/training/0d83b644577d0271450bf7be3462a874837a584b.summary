the award stated : ' despite the ferocity of the insurgent 's resistance , @entity1 refused to be beaten			1
' his total disregard for his own safety in ensuring that the last grenade was posted accurately was the gallant last action of a soldier who had willingly placed himself in the line of fire on numerous occasions earlier in the attack			1
' this supremely courageous and inspiring action deserves the highest recognition			0
' the @entity7 has been awarded just ten times to @entity50 soldiers since the @entity51			1
the posthumous honour to @entity53 , of the @entity54 the @entity10 , is just the second from the 12 - year conflict in @entity27			1

capt @entity107 said that with heavy fighting taking place elsewhere on the outskirts of the village , the compound ' had to be cleared '			0
he said a number of options were ruled out before @entity18 volunteered to try to ' post a grenade ' into the room where the insurgent was hiding capt @entity107 said there was no chance of help from a combat helicopter supporting the operation , or any point using a portable rocket launcher because his own men would be caught in the resulting blasts			2
using grenade launchers was also ruled out because trees near the doorway of the @entity12 fighter ’s position were blocking their line of sight			1
' @entity53 suggested that if he moved along a low wall , he would be out of line of sight , ' said capt @entity107			2
' he was confident he could get the grenade in the doorway , allowing me and capt @entity156 to assault the position			2
' across the compound , @entity158 saw his friend ' @entity161 ' ' crawling along the wall on his belt buckle '			0
as @entity18 got near the doorway , covered by the low wall , @entity158 saw bullets pepper the ground inches from his friend and he called out ' @entity161 , get out of there '			0

capt @entity107 , waiting a few yards away , said both he and capt @entity156 were surprised when they realised the explosion had gone off by @entity18 ’s position			0

he said there were ' no signs of life ' from @entity53			2
the insurgent was killed some minutes later when he was flushed out with grenades and shot			0

he added that there would have been ' virtually instantaneous loss of consciousness '			0
dr @entity205 also noted bruising to the heart caused by the blunt trauma of a bullet impacting on the soldier ’s body armour			2
@entity216 , an expert on the @entity218 body armour @entity50 soldiers wear into battle , said the protective plate at the front of @entity18 ’s vest had been fractured by a bullet , but it failed to penetrate			0
the bullet was of the calibre fired from ak47 - type weapons favoured by the @entity12			1
mrs @entity15 , giving her verdict , said : ' @entity1 bravely volunteered to throw the last grenade			1
' he crouched down by a wall and sadly his body armour was struck by a single gunshot which knocked him to the ground			0

instituted by @entity250 in 1856 , the @entity7 is awarded for ' most conspicuous bravery , or some daring or pre-eminent act of valour or self - sacrifice , or extreme devotion to duty in the presence of the enemy			1
' it is hand - made from bronze cannon captured from the @entity244 at the siege of @entity262 in 1854 - 55 during the @entity245			0
the bronze cross , which has a crimson ribbon bears the inscription ' for @entity266 ' , is cast from the metal of @entity244 guns captured at the siege of @entity262 during the @entity245 , the campaign in which the first medals were awarded			0
the @entity7 may be awarded to all ranks of the services - and also to civilians - to recognise gallantry in the presence of the enemy			1

the @entity249 , which stands equal to the @entity7 as an award , recognises acts of gallantry by members of the @entity313 or civilians in situations for which the @entity7 is not appropriate			2
