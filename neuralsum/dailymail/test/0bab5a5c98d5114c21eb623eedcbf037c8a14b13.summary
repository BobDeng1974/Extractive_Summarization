young professional footballers can be an easy target with some of their behaviour but on thursday afternoon it was refreshing to sit down and talk with @entity4			1
he struck me as a thoroughly decent young man who lives his life the right way			2
he is a credit to his family and his easy - going manner means he must a dream to work with			2
we discussed life at @entity16 , scoring against @entity17 and his @entity19 dreams			1
you can watch the full interview on @entity23 on @entity24 today at 12.10pm and @entity25 ’s semi-final with @entity16 live on @entity24 from 5.05pm			1
@entity4 talks to @entity28 's @entity27 ahead of @entity16 's @entity19 semi-final against @entity25 @entity27 : you ’ve played at @entity30 many times and you ’ve played in a semi-final as well but you ’re now one step away from an @entity19 final			1
does that bring extra nerves ? @entity4 : not really			1
i think we ’ve basically just got to play the game , not the occasion			2
the team was in this position last year and coming up against @entity43 proved to be one of the toughest games of the season			2
against @entity25 today is going to be another tough game			1
we ’ve just got to approach it the right way and we want to get through to the final			2
@entity4 expects a tough test as @entity16 face a @entity53 side at @entity30 for the second year in a row @entity55 : how are you settling in ? you seem to have been here all your life almost and you ’ve only been here seven or eight months			1
@entity4 : the staff at the club , at the training ground and everyone has been very welcoming			1
the fans have been brilliant			2
my team - mates are class and i ’m just really enjoying my time here			2
i ’ve settled in very well			2
it ’s a transitional year for me , getting to know new players , new team - mates , new systems and new ways of going about things at a different club			2
i think i ’ve put in a few good performances			2
i ’ve been unlucky on the club front with goals and that ’s something i know will come in abundance when i get to know everything spot on with the club and i ’m pretty sure that will happen			2
the @entity16 striker thinks he has been unlucky in front of goal , but wants to play in a more central role @entity55 : you talk about goals , you ’re playing in a wide position			1
what ’s your favourite position ? @entity4 : it ’s no secret i prefer to play down the middle			1
but the formation we play at @entity16 , you ’re playing on the left or the right			1
we ’re always interchanging , playing in a three - man attack			2
it ’s much easier doing that than playing left midfield or left wing in a four - man midfield			1
@entity55 : @entity100 has worked with lots of strikers over the years and been able to develop them			0
what ’s the area that he ’s working on most with you most of all ? @entity4 : we talk about the game , we analyse performances and on the training pitch we ’ve also got the other staff here so after training we do a bit of individual work so that happens every day			1
you are always looking at ways to improve as a player , to develop and i feel like i am developing well as a player			0
@entity4 , who says he has been made to feel very welcome at @entity16 , holds of @entity122 in training @entity55 : is it your movement he works on ? is it holding up the ball ? finishing ? or is it a combination ? @entity4 : it ’s a combination of everything			1
you do n’t just work on one thing			0
every single day all the lads after training go out and do finishing			0
@entity55 : does that become competitive ? to see who can score the most goals ? @entity4 : yeah it does ! it gets competitive but it ’s obviously all fun			1
but at the end of the day nobody wants to come last			0
we work on a lot of areas of our game			0
like his team - mate @entity146 , @entity4 is often forced out wide , despite preferring being a central striker @entity55 : in the last round you put out @entity17			1
how did it feel to score at @entity151 ? @entity4 : it was a weird occasion for me going to back to @entity151 on the away side			1
the weirdest thing was warming up on the other side of the pitch			0
it just felt a bit weird			0
but you have to treat it like it ’s any other game and play the game , not the occasion			0
obviously i was going back to a club that brought me up and going back to the fans that supported me for years , playing against old team - mates , my old friends , it was a weird occasion			1
but i scored the goal , a big goal to get us through to the semi-final			0
so it was a spur of the moment to celebrate			0
the @entity177 international scored the winning goal on his return to @entity151 in the quarter finals last month @entity55 : did it cross your mind not to celebrate ? @entity4 : leading up to the game i had no plans whatsoever			1
i just wanted to play the game , get it over and done with and get through to @entity30 and get to the semi-final			1
i scored the goal and whatever i did i would have been criticised – criticised if i celebrated or criticised if i did n’t			0
it was just spur of the moment			0
@entity55 : against @entity17 you seemed extra motivated			1
was it anything to do with @entity196 ’s comments before the match ? @entity4 : i did n’t see the comments			1
going into every game i want to be motivated			0
playing against @entity17 – i did it earlier in the season at the @entity202 – and then it was a bit different this time going back to @entity151			1
there was motivation there but i ’m motivated in every game			0
i want to do well for my team , try and win the game and in that case get through to the semi-final			0
listen , everyone is entitled to their own opinions , some you like , some you do n’t like but that ’s just football and it ’s life			0
@entity4 celebrates in front of his old fans , a decision he says was entirely spur of the moment @entity55 : i think you showed a lot of mental strength going into that situation			1
it ’s always difficult going back			0
@entity4 : you ’ve got to be strong mentally living the life and being a professional footballer			1
there ’s a lot of people out to get you and whatever you do , everyone ’s watching			0
you ’ve just got to be switched on 100 per cent of the time			0
that ’s just the way i ’ve been brought up			0
my parents are lovely , caring people and they look after me well , they brought me up well and it ’s the same with me and my brothers that ’s credit to them			0
the striker has quickly become a favourite at the @entity202 , and he thanked the fans for their support @entity55 : this weekend it ’s @entity25			1
have you looked much at their team ? @entity4 : you get to watch a few games throughout the season			1
i know they ’ve got players with @entity256 experience			0
i ’ve seen them a couple of games this season being a bit direct			0
[ @entity263 ] @entity262 ’s a player they look for quite often from the back and the wingers will be coming inside to get the ball and flick - ons			0
@entity269 plays a bit more inside and [ @entity272 ] @entity271 is a bit more out and out on the right wing			2
@entity4 has been working hard in training to try and improve his finishing , along with his team - mates @entity55 : good knowledge … @entity4 : yeah i know quite a lot about football ! @entity55 : as a centre forward or a winger , do you look for the weaknesses in the opposition ? @entity4 : you ’ve got to analyse the positives and negatives in every single team			2
you look at that and obviously see where you can nullify their attack and see where their weaknesses are at the back			0
the @entity295 forward picked out @entity262 as one of @entity25 's most dangerous players @entity55 : how much would it mean to you to get to the @entity19 final ? @entity4 : it would mean a lot			1
i ’ve been in this position before with @entity17 when we played @entity304 in the semi-finals a few years back and we lost on penalties			2
i remember the situation , i remember how i felt that day and that ’s something i do n’t want to feel again			0
i just want to get to the next stage , get to the final			0
this is a very important game so we ’re all looking forward to it , we ’re going to approach it like it ’s any other and play the game not the occasion .			0
