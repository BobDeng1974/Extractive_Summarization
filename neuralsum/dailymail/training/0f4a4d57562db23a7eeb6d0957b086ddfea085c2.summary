@entity0 yesterday rounded on the ‘ powerful forces ’ and ‘ vested interests ’ he believes are plotting to stop him entering @entity3			1
in a highly charged speech designed to draw a line under weeks of turmoil in @entity7 ranks , mr @entity0 risked accusations of paranoia as he insisted : ‘ when powerful forces try to tell me “ no way ” , i answer : “ who says ? ” ‘ i ’m willing to put up with whatever is thrown at me			1
’ mr @entity0 ’s speech in @entity16 amounted to a passionate defence of his ability to lead his party and the country after some discontented @entity21 suggested privately he should be replaced			1
although only 13 per cent of people think he is up to being prime minister , mr @entity0 insisted he had the ‘ resilience ’ and ‘ thick skin ’ to do the job			1
he promised to talk more about the issue of immigration – which he forgot to mention in his disastrous party conference speech , along with the deficit – and attacked firms for ‘ exploiting ’ cheap migrant labour to undercut wages of @entity24 workers			1
he also launched a fierce attack on @entity23 , which has eaten into @entity7 ’s core working - class vote in some areas , suggesting the party was prejudiced against working women , foreigners and gays and lesbians			1
mr @entity0 pledged to tackle a ‘ zero - zero economy ’ , saying many ordinary workers were on so - called zero - hours contracts while the rich ‘ get away with zero tax ’			1
mr @entity0 delivered his speech to @entity7 activists at @entity63 at the @entity64 , hitting back at his critics mr @entity0 suggested establishment enemies were ranged against him , while the @entity67 ' think that @entity24 does best when the most powerful do best ' mr @entity0 insisted he has the resilience to win the election , as he took aim at vested interests he blames for opposing his plan for change senior @entity7 figures insisted last night that ‘ @entity75 would freeze over ’ before they joined forces with @entity77 after the election			1
on wednesday , the @entity23 leader said he would be prepared to prop up a @entity7 government if @entity0 failed to win a majority and @entity23 secured about ten seats			1
mr @entity77 said he would ‘ do a deal with the @entity84 ’ if it ‘ got me what i wanted ’ – apparently a reference to his demand for a referendum on @entity24 ’s membership of the @entity90 last night a senior @entity7 figure dismissed the idea , saying ‘ @entity75 would freeze over ’ before @entity7 did a deal with @entity23			1
‘ the @entity67 have no answers to the discontent people feel , ’ he said			2
‘ @entity23 have wildly wrong answers to that discontent			2
and who knows what one can say about the @entity100 ? ’ quoting a phrase used by @entity102 in his farewell conference speech in 2006 , he insisted : ‘ friends , i say we can take this lot apart – and it is time we did			1
’ mr @entity0 added : ‘ no vested interest , whoever they are and however powerful they are , from banks to energy companies , should ever be able to hold our country back			1
’ aides suggest a shadowy network of @entity118 institutions , energy companies , media magnates , payday lenders and hedge funds is determined to stop him winning power			0
they insisted mr @entity0 did not blame them for his recent difficulties , but he was determined to confront powerful establishment figures			2
@entity0 's net satisfaction ratings have slumped 10 points to -44 , the worst for any main party leader six months before a general election , according to @entity133 data dating back to the 1970s the @entity33 have pulled into a three - point lead , their biggest margin over @entity7 since 2010 shadow health secretary @entity136 , touted as a potential leader , said mr @entity0 was prepared to ‘ stand up for ordinary people against vested interests ’			1
‘ that is what has defined his leadership of the @entity7 , against energy companies ... against the banks , and yes , against parts of the media , ’ he said			1
‘ and for those reasons there are people out there who do n’t want him to win			0
’ @entity33 chairman @entity151 said : ‘ @entity0 and those in his bunker may have convinced themselves his difficulties are all the result of some sort of conspiracy			2
but the truth is , it ’s the voters he has the real problem with			0
’ a @entity33 source added : ‘ i ’m surprised @entity0 was n’t wearing a tin - foil hat today			2
his conspiracy theories are out of control			0
’ mr @entity77 last night responded to mr @entity0 ’s attacks by challenging him to a live tv debate , telling the @entity7 leader : ‘ come and have a go			1
’ @entity171 ' vested interests ' @entity172 : no vested interest , whoever they are and however powerful they are ... should ever be able to hold our country back			0
between now and the election they are going to use every tactic to try to destabilise , distract us and throw us off course			0
' reality : shadow health secretary @entity136 says these ‘ vested interests ’ include the right - wing media – accused by @entity7 of concocting stories of a leadership crisis			1
in fact , the turmoil was triggered by a savage attack on mr @entity0 by the @entity192 magazine , which labelled him an ‘ old - style @entity194 socialist ’ ; and the @entity192 - leaning @entity195 , which reported that @entity7 backbench @entity21 had called for him to quit			1
it was fuelled by @entity198 , which claimed 20 @entity200 members were on the brink of calling for mr @entity0 to step down			2
@entity202 ? @entity172 : we have n’t had the best couple of weeks			2
disunited parties are parties that the public worries about and i understand that			0
reality : so which is it – is the @entity7 disunited , as he appears to concede , or is it all a great conspiracy by the media and the shadowy ‘ vested interests ’ ? his remarks are certainly a sharp u-turn on last week , when he claimed there was no discontent in the @entity7 ranks			2
last thursday , he told the @entity195 : ‘ i do n’t accept that this matter [ concern over his leadership ] arises			0
honestly , this is nonsense			0
’ the ' @entity223 ' @entity172 : people are asking why they are on zero - hours contracts while some of those at the top get away with paying zero tax			0
the zero - zero economy , we need to change			0
reality : not only is the zero - zero economy an ugly , wonkish soundbite – it ’s disingenuous			0
there is no legal way for a high - earning individual in @entity24 to pay no tax unless they have donated all their earnings to charity			2
the people in @entity24 who pay no income tax are people whose salary is less than £ 10,000 ( many of whom will be on zero - hours contracts )			0
it took the @entity33 / @entity248 to raise the threshold for the personal tax allowances immigration @entity251 @entity172 : it is n’t prejudiced to worry about the effects of immigration			0
it is because of the real impacts it has			0
reality : only last month , @entity7 led criticism of @entity33 defence secretary @entity259 when he warned communities feel ‘ swamped ’ by mass immigration – despite it being a view shared by @entity7 ’s own ex-home secretary , @entity263			0
shadow foreign secretary @entity264 accused mr @entity259 of not being ‘ responsible ’			0
@entity7 continues to resist any changes to @entity90 free movement .			0

@entity7 leader uses make or break speech to get leadership back on track
admits his ' *mettle* has been tested ' by a ' difficult couple of weeks '
takes a swipe at @entity23 for wanting to take @entity24 back to an ' unjust past '
@entity133 survey : @entity67 on *32* ****%**** , @entity7 *29* ****%**** , @entity23 *14* ****%**** , @entity100 9 ****%****
@entity0 's net satisfaction rating slumps 10 points to -44 per cent
figure is worse than anyone who has ever run for prime minister
