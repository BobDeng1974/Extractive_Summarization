it was one of the most audacious missions of @entity2 that saw false information about @entity4 plans to invade @entity5 planted into the hands of a @entity8 intelligence officer			1
and today a @entity10 flag from @entity11 - which had a crucial role in the clandestine mission known as ' @entity14 ' - has emerged , 70 years after the famous event			1
in april 1943 the senior crew of the @entity18 submarine dropped the body of a @entity21 tramp , dressed up as a uniformed commando , a mile off the @entity24 coast			1
a piece of history : a @entity10 flag denoting a @entity18 submarine 's clandestine mission known as ' @entity14 ' has emerged after 70 years secret mission : the corpse of @entity21 tramp @entity32 was dropped into the sea near to @entity24 by @entity11 's commander lt @entity35 - a moment imagined in the film @entity38 , above false identity papers showed the corpse to be that of major @entity14 of the @entity43 and attached to his wrist was a briefcase containing secret bogus plans			1
the highly - sensitive papers falsely stated the @entity48 planned to invade @entity5 through @entity49 and @entity50			1
as planned , when the body washed ashore in southern @entity24 the documents ended up in the hands of a local @entity8 intelligence officer			1
as a result the @entity8 high command diverted troops to @entity50 and @entity49 - away from @entity58 where the @entity48 successfully invaded two months later			1
it gave the @entity48 a foothold on @entity62 ’s fortress in @entity63 for the first time since @entity65			0
' @entity14 ' : mr @entity32 's body , pictured , was taken from a @entity68 hospital and kept aboard the @entity11 in a canister - which most thought held a meteorological device the extraordinary deception was later the basis of the film @entity38			1
to mark the special operation the flagman on @entity11 added a dagger emblem to the submarine 's @entity10 to go alongside five others for clandestine missions			1
it was tradition for @entity18 submarines to have its own skull and cross bones after a @entity88 famously compared submarine warfare to piracy			0
emblems were added to the flags each time the submarine sunk an enemy or completed a mission			0
one of the other daggers on the flag signified a bizarre special operation which involved the entire crew speaking in @entity100 accents to appease an @entity103 - hating @entity102 general they were rescuing			2
general @entity105 refused to board a @entity107 craft and so the sub hoisted the @entity109 and pretended to be @entity100			0
the @entity11 's @entity10 was kept by a junior rating , whose role was to update it , after it was replaced by a new one in 1944			1
he handed it on to his son who has now made it available for sale at auction and is estimated to fetch £ 10,000			1
@entity119 @entity118 , of @entity120 of @entity121 , @entity122 , where the flag is to go on sale said : ' it is rare for these @entity10 to come on the open market because most of them went to the submarine captain or ended up at a museum			2
' it is hard to value it because they are so rare but this one does carry a premium because of the association with @entity14			2
imagined : a scene from film @entity38 shows the body being carried through the streets the plan was the brainchild of an eccentric 25 - year - old @entity142 flight lieutenant named @entity143 - who took it to the chief of @entity146 , naval lieutenant commander @entity147			2
@entity148 of the @entity149 was a group so secret that only 20 people even knew of its existence			0
codenamed @entity14 by @entity147 - as a bleak joke on the fact that it hinged on the discovery by the enemy of a corpse - the cunning scheme was hatched in a tiny basement beneath the @entity159 in @entity160 which had once been used as a wine cellar			1
it was a plan that was to make history - but first it had to be approved by @entity166 's inter-service @entity164 ( named after the @entity167 , or double cross ) , which oversaw the use of double agents			0
@entity143 told the @entity164 that his plan was simple - they would obtain a body from a @entity68 hospital , dress it up in a military uniform , fill the corpse 's lungs with water , provide it with misleading documents , and then drop it from an aircraft so that it washed up on the coast of @entity24			1
the plan was all the more important as @entity107 's prime minister @entity182 , above , had agreed with the @entity100 president @entity183 in january 1943 that - in the wake of the @entity4 success in @entity187 - the next step would be to attack @entity58 , as the first step to the invasion of @entity5			1
the troops would then aim to take on the rest of @entity63 from the country			0
however , as @entity182 himself famously remarked , ' everyone but a bloody fool would know ' that their objective was to attack @entity58 - and so the clandestine plan was hatched			2
it was hoped that if the @entity8 and their @entity5 partners could be made to believe the @entity48 were going to attack @entity49 , some 500 miles to the east , and @entity50 , the @entity8 might divert some significant part of their forces , which would help the invasion succeed			1
attack : @entity100 soldiers landing on the coast of @entity102 in the @entity209 landings june 6th 1944 - a year after the successful ' @entity14 ' mission so , at 4.30am on april 30 , 1943 , @entity11 surfaced a mile off the @entity24 coastal town of @entity212 , and the vessel 's commander lieutenant @entity35 and a few senior officers gently pushed the body into the sea			1
the body was supposed to be that of major @entity14 of the @entity43			2
it was found washed up by a fisherman at 9.30am and was reported to @entity8 agent @entity223			0
as well as the ‘ top secret ’ documents , love letters from the body 's pretend fiancee were also placed on his body			0
by doing so , the men from the @entity231 believe they saved the lives of some 40,000 @entity107 servicemen and women			0
' the flying of a @entity10 on a submarine is a @entity107 tradition that still goes on today and whenever an operation has been completed a new emblem is stitched on to it			0
' the provenance for this one is excellent			0
the vendor ’s father served aboard @entity11 as a junior rating but it was his remit to look after the @entity10 and update it			2
man with a plan : lt commander @entity249 , section chief of @entity149 group @entity148 , pictured , worked with @entity142 lieutenant @entity143 to create the corpse 's identity ' a new @entity10 was taken into service when the submarine had a new captain in march 1944 and this one was preserved by the vendor ’s father who took it with him on leaving the vessel			0
' @entity11 was chosen to take part in @entity14 because of its previous success with special operations			2
its commander , lieutenant @entity35 , knew the truth of the operation but he had to tell his men the canister carrying the body of the dead tramp , whose real name was @entity32 , contained a meteorological device			0
at 4.30am on april 30 , 1943 , @entity11 surfaced a mile off the @entity24 coastal town of @entity212 , and lt @entity35 and a few senior officers gently pushed the body into the sea			1
it was found washed up by a fisherman at 9.30am and was reported to @entity8 agent @entity223			0
as well as the ‘ top secret ’ documents , love letters from the body 's pretend fiancee were also placed on his body to give the deception more credence			0
after the war @entity11 was broken up			2
its conning tower was preserved as a memorial at @entity290 in @entity291 , @entity292 , @entity100			0
it is the only shore installation in the @entity100 where the @entity18 ensign is allowed to be permanently flown			0
the @entity10 flag , that measures 31ins by 48ins , is being sold by @entity298 on november 6 .			1

@entity10 flag from @entity11 has appeared after 70 years
craft had a crucial role in mission - codenamed ' @entity14 '
saw body of a tramp , dressed as a uniformed commando with a briefcase full of bogus ' secret plans ' tied to his wrist , *dumped* off the coast of @entity24
