by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 11:05 est , 12 december 2013 updated : 12:38 est , 12 december 2013 what would make the perfect @entity3 present for the prime minister after the week he has had ? a photo frame for the latest selfie ? a beginner ’s guide to contempt of court ? a shopping spree to spend his £ 7,400 mp ’s pay rise ? in fact @entity14 has revealed he has much simpler tastes and is looking forward to some peace and quiet over the festive break			1
and some squidgy tennis balls			1
new balls please : @entity21 fan @entity14 has revealed he wants squidgy tennis balls for @entity3 in recent days mr @entity14 has found himself making headlines for all the wrong reasons			1
news outlets around the world carried pictures of him posing for a selfie with the @entity30 prime minister and @entity32 president during @entity34 ’s memorial service			2
and today he has been rebuked by a judge for backing tv cook @entity36 in an ongoing court case			2
but as he come under fresh pressure to reject a planned 11 per cent pay hike for mps , the prime minister has admitted that he hopes that the @entity3 holidays will bring some respite from his frantic schedule			2
mr @entity14 , a keen tennis fan , said he had started playing the sport with his son @entity45 , seven , and wanted balls that would not travel too far when you ‘ really whack ’ them			1
the prime minister is looking forward to a festive break from the cut and thrust of political life speaking to @entity53 and @entity54 about what he wanted for @entity3 he said : ‘ a bit of peace and quiet would be quite a nice thing but you can never bank on that in this job			1
’ he added : ‘ i want some squidgy tennis balls			1
i have started playing tennis with my son			2
‘ i would like those ones which you can really whack and they do n't go very far			0
‘ if @entity68 's listening , you can get them down the chimney pretty easily and there will be a very happy recipient at the other end			0
’ mr @entity14 was yesterday forced to defend his decision to pose for a light - hearted ‘ selfie ’ in the middle of @entity34 ’s memorial service – by claiming he was only being polite			1
the prime minister said the snap with @entity32 president @entity81 and @entity30 leader @entity82 was proof that even in death @entity34 was ‘ bringing people together ’			2
miss @entity82 is the daughter - in - law of former @entity87 leader @entity86 , and when she asked for a group photo it was ‘ it was only polite to say yes ’ , mr @entity14 told @entity40			1
mr @entity14 was challenged over the photo at @entity79 ’s questions by @entity93 mp @entity92 , who asked him : ‘ has the prime minister had the opportunity to discuss international mobile phone usage with any other @entity97 heads of government over the last day or so ? ’ to laughter from @entity40 , mr @entity14 replied : ‘ you could say , in a roundabout way			1
perhaps in my defence , you should always remember that the television cameras are always on			0
‘ but in my defence i would say that @entity34 played an extraordinary role in his life and in his death in bringing people together			0
' so of course when a member of the @entity86 family asked me for a photograph , i thought it was only polite to say yes			0
' the polite thing to do : @entity14 has defended posing for this selfie during @entity34 's memorial service , saying it was proof the late leader was still ' bringing people together ' deputy prime minister @entity120 also came to mr @entity14 's defence today			1
speaking on his radio phone - in on @entity123 , mr @entity120 said : ' i know some people are n't happy about it			0
i think it was a bit of friendly light - hearted joking around by the three of them			0
i personally do n't feel that people should be too censorious about it at all			0
' he added : ' it was a very celebratory atmosphere , it was a real celebration of the man 's life			0
there was dancing , there was singing , the crowd was in a very jubilant mood			0
' so it was n't as out of keeping with the setting as i think some people have suggested			0
