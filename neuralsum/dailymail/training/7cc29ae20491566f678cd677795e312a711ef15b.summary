by @entity0 the @entity1 is suspending its programs in @entity4 because of security concerns and is pulling more than 50 volunteers out of the country until threat levels decrease , the @entity1 and @entity2 said on thursday			1
a statement to @entity0 from the @entity2 said that the @entity1 ' has been closely monitoring the security environment in @entity4 ... and has decided to officially suspend the program in @entity4			1
' the @entity1 will monitor the security situation and determine when volunteers can return , it said			0
the decision comes amid a tightening of security by the @entity18 in @entity4 , which has seen dozens of grenade and gunfire attacks the last two years			2
earlier this year the @entity21 increased the number of security personnel at the embassy and put armed @entity25 behind sandbag bunkers on the embassy roof			1
too dangerous : @entity1 volunteers in @entity4 are being told to leave the country as gun violence is on the rise the @entity2 also reduced the number of @entity21 personnel here by moving a regional @entity35 office out of the country			1
the decision to suspend the @entity1 program has been in the works for a while but was not announced publicly			0
@entity21 warnings about the high risk of terror attacks in @entity4 always ruffle the feathers of @entity4 leaders , and the @entity2 and @entity1 statements underscored the long @entity21 - @entity4 relationship and the hundreds of millions of dollars the @entity21 pours into @entity4 every year			1
but it was clear that given the grenade and gunfire assaults , as well as the massive attack on @entity53 last year that killed at least 67 people , the government felt that its @entity1 volunteers — who live in far - flung villages with little security protection — were vulnerable			1
underscoring the danger of random violence , a police officer in the coastal town of @entity62 confirmed that a foreign woman had been shot and killed thursday while walking the city streets , the second foreigner killed this month in the area			0
recent @entity1 volunteers in @entity4 said they felt the @entity21 government program did a good job of keeping them updated about security , including the sending of security text messages , but they acknowledged that security was deteriorating			1
there to help : the @entity1 hopes the volunteers can return ' to support the country in meeting its development goals ' ' some volunteers were n't very pleased with the level of security they provided , but i 'm not sure what they were expecting			2
we do n't have security guards to protect us , and it 's @entity4 , so sometimes bad things happen regardless of any preventative measures , ' said @entity90 , a 28 - year - old volunteer in @entity4 from 2009 - 11 now studying at the @entity91			2
the @entity1 , which was founded in 1961 after the suggestion of then - sen. @entity93 , has some 7,000 volunteers in 65 countries working on education , health and environmental issues			0
nearly 50 percent of the program 's volunteers are in @entity101			0
the program has had to pull volunteers out of dangerous situations before , including in @entity105 in 2004 and in @entity4 after the 2007 - 08 election violence			2
the @entity1 also suspended its program in @entity108 in april			0
@entity90 was initially placed in western @entity4 with a public health program but his house was broken into and his belongings stolen , so the program moved him to another province , where he stayed for two years			0
sad to leave : @entity1 volunteers feel as though the @entity21 has done well protecting them thus far but that dangers are on the rise and it 's in their best interest to leave ' they taught us to be smart about our surroundings and to trust the hairs on the back of our necks to sense whether it was a safe situation or not			1
and some things like bombings or grenade attacks , you just ca n't prepare for other than leaving the country , ' he said @entity130 a @entity1 volunteer in @entity132 , @entity4 from 2010 - 12 who still lives in the country , said she always felt safe as a @entity1 volunteer because the @entity21 mission was ' always making the best decisions regarding our safety and well - being			1
' ' my opinion ... is that things just were n't getting better , ' said @entity143			0
' @entity1 had already taken measures to protect volunteers but had to ultimately make a bigger decision			0
and it a wise one			0
' at full strength the @entity1 has had more than 125 volunteers in @entity4 in recent years , and the pull - outs will hurt communities receiving @entity21 assistance			1
@entity152 , the spokeswoman for the @entity1 , said the program hopes the volunteers can return ' to support the country in meeting its development goals			2
' a third recent @entity1 volunteer in @entity4 , @entity157 , said there was no doubt that aid groups , schools and pharmacies would be negatively affected by the pull - out			2
' @entity4 is spearheading the growth and trends of so many sectors in @entity101 ; it is a shame to see such a wonderful program be cut from a country that has so much potential , ' he said .			0
