this gruesome video shows how a man popped a huge cyst in his arm with a needle , screwdriver and a pair of pliers			1
the man , known only as @entity9 , from @entity10 , uploaded the clip to @entity12 after his wife filmed the stomach - churning moment			1
it begins with him explaining exactly how he will pop the grape - sized growth on his wrist			1
he says : ' we have the pliers , they 're going to hold onto the needle which will then be smashed into my cyst with the end of a screwdriver			1
' it should be pretty cool			2
' the man , known only as @entity9 , uploaded the video to @entity12 of his unique way of popping a cyst - using a needle , a pair of pliers and a screwdriver			1
pictured is his sister in law putting the needle into the swelling as @entity9 's sister in law hammers the needle deeper into the cyst with the handle of a screwdriver , he emits loud cries of pain first , he lays his left arm down on some kitchen roll on a table so the lump is easily accessible			1
his sister - in - law then inserts the needle into the cyst and holds it in place with a pair of pliers as he winces			1
she then begins the horrifying process of hammering the needle deeper into the growth			1
@entity61 cries of pain are heard from @entity9 with each hit			1
astonishingly , though the process seems too agonising to bear , @entity9 says : ' i think we can go a little deeper '			1
after one last hammer – which was once again met with a loud moan – he says : ' it 's in there pretty good			0
now we 've got to pull it out			0
dr @entity73 , a private gp in @entity75 , condemned @entity9 's method of popping his cyst with a needle , pliers and a screwdriver			1
he told @entity81 : ' we advise not draining minor ganglions			1
' they just get bigger and bigger			0
we only drain it if they are very large and hindering the use of the hand			0
' it ’s wrong to pop a ganglion with a needle and a screwdriver on so many levels			1
traditionally , ganglions would be ' bashed with the family bible ' , but doctors do not advise this ' from a hygiene point of view you ’ve got to sterilise your equipment			1
we would never insert a needle that would be used in the house			2
they are covered in millions of bacteria			0
' you can never control the force by using a screwdriver , and that ’s dangerous			2
' there are very fine arteries and nerves in the hand , and they ’re so easy to damage			0
' if they are damaged you get irreversible pain			0
if you think how often you use your hand that can be debilitating			0
' there used to be a myth that you should bash a ganglion with a family bible to burst it			2
' that ’s caused problems with the fluid going into the wrist joint , causing carpel tunnel syndrome : swelling inside the wrist			1
' if we did treat it , we ’d do a needle aspiration , which means sucking out the glue - like pus			1
' but that would be what is known as " aseptic " , meaning the pus would be drawn out into the syringe and would never touch the wound , to prevent infection			0
' we would also do it under ultrasound so as not to damage the fine veins and arteries in the hand			0
' if you have a ganglion or a swelling you must go to your gp and they will advise whether its ok or whether it ’s best to be left alone			1
' then it will be followed up and receive proper after care			0
' ' i 'm going to see if we can get the fluid squirting out if it does			2
' moments later , he takes the needle out and asks the camera to zoom in on his arm			1
as he squeezes the cyst , sticky , translucent jelly comes rushing out and gathers in a pea - sized ball			1
' let 's see what the consistency looks like , ' he said as he rubs the gluey substance between two fingers			0
he adds : ' this is probably the grossest thing i 've ever seen – since the last time i 've done this			0
' this will probably do the trick for three or so months until i have to pop it again			0
' uploading the video to @entity12 under the name ' the @entity172 ' , he promises to upload another video in another three months time when he pops the cyst again			2
unsurprisingly , medical professionals do not advise using @entity9 's method to treat lumps found on the body			1
dr @entity73 , a private gp in @entity75 , explains that @entity9 's cyst is a ganglion , a fluid - filled swelling that develops near a joint or a tendon			1
they are made up of a thick jelly - like fluid called synovial fluid , which surrounds joints and tendons to lubricate them during movement - and occur when this fluid leaks out and collects under the skin			1
@entity193 can occur alongside any joint in the body , but are most commonly found on the wrist , hand and fingers			2
generally harmless , if they do not cause any pain , they can be left alone and will disappear without any treatment			0
dr @entity73 said : ' we advise not draining minor ganglions			2
they just get bigger and bigger			0
we only drain it if they are very large and hindering the use of the hand			0
' a ganglion is a fluid - filled sack			1
if you start the drainage process , the bigger and bigger the sack will fill			0
' this is the issue this gentleman has caused , he ’ll need to drain it more often			0
' traditionally , ganglions were treated by being ' bashed with the family bible ' , but this is no longer recommended , as this could cause the fluid to disperse and cause carpel tunnel syndrome - a swelling in the wrist - he added			1
dr @entity73 added @entity9 's method was also not advisable either			2
he told @entity81 : ' it ’s wrong to pop a ganglion with a needle and a screwdriver on so many levels			1
it ’s unhygienic , you ca n’t control the force and you could damage the nerves in the hand			0
' from a hygiene point of view you ’ve got to sterilise your equipment			0
we would never insert a needle that would be used in the house			2
they are covered in millions of bacteria			0
' you can never control the force by using a screwdriver , and that ’s dangerous			2
' there are very fine arteries and nerves in the hand , and they ’re so easy to damage			0
if they are damaged you get irreversible pain			0
if you think how often you use your hand that can be debilitating			0
' he removes the needle and squeezes the cyst , and a ball of sticky , see - through jelly - like fluid emerges @entity9 rubs his fingers together to show the sticky consistency of the fluid that comes out of the growth , which doctors explain is synovial fluid , which surrounds joints and tendons to lubricate them at the end of the video , @entity9 says the cyst will need draining again in three months			1
but doctors strongly advise against his method - and say ganglions do not normally require treatment if the cyst needs treatment , the fluid should be drained out with a needle and syringe by a doctor , or cut out in a surgical procedure			1
dr @entity73 added : ' if we did treat it , we ’d do a needle aspiration , which means sucking out the glue - like pus			2
' but that would be what is known as " aseptic " , meaning the pus would be drawn out into the syringe and would never touch the wound , to prevent infection			0

' then it will be followed up and receive proper after care			0

the man , known only as @entity9 , is filmed popping the ganglion on his wrist
involves hammering a needle into his arm with the handle of a screwdriver
a sticky ball of see - through jelly emerges from the cyst afterwards
doctors do not advise popping ganglions as more fluid returns in *future*
