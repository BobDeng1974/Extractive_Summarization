by @entity0 published : 13:21 est , 15 november 2012 updated : 14:01 est , 15 november 2012 governor @entity1 of @entity2 , a former vice-presidential prospect in 2012 and potential 2016 @entity5 candidate has branded @entity6 as ' absolutely wrong ' for saying he lost the election because of @entity9 's ' gifts ' to voters			1
' i absolutely reject that notion , ' @entity1 said on a conference call with donors today			1
' i do n’t think that represents where we are as a party and where we ’re going as a party			1
and that has got to be one of the most fundamental takeaways from this election			2
' the remarks will be seen as early jockeying for position among the 2016 @entity5 hopefuls			1
outraged : @entity2 @entity5 governor @entity1 said @entity6 was ' absolutely wrong ' to say he lost the election because of @entity9 's ' gifts ' to voters along with senator @entity32 of @entity33 , governor @entity34 of @entity35 and representative @entity36 , @entity6 's running mate , @entity1 , 41 , is seen as one of the new generation of @entity5 who will vie for the @entity40 in four years			1
@entity6 , speaking to his own campaign donors earlier in the day , said that @entity9 's ' very generous ' healthcare reform and directive to allow some illegal immigrants to remain in the @entity45 as ' highly motivational ' to some voter groups			1
' the president ’s campaign focused on giving targeted groups a big gift - so he made a big effort on small things			2
those small things , by the way , add up to trillions of dollars			2
' at a meeting of the @entity57 ( @entity57 ) , however , @entity1 , who is @entity55 , criticised the @entity6 campaign for failing to present a ' vision ' to @entity45 and argued that the @entity5 nominee 's campaign allowed the election to become a ' contest between personalities '			1
' we have got to stop dividing the @entity45 voters , ' @entity1 said , according to the @entity67			1
' if we ’re going to continue to be a competitive party and win elections on the national stage , and continue to fight for our conservative principles , we need two messages to get out loudly and clearly			1
sore loser ? @entity6 said low - income voters , minorities and young people gave @entity9 a second term in the @entity40 ' one , we are fighting for 100 percent of the votes			1
and second , our policies benefit every @entity45 who wants to pursue the @entity82 , period			2
' but in a conference call with his national finance committee , @entity6 said @entity9 's win was based on bribing loyal @entity87 constituencies			1
the poor had been promised ' free health care ' , illegal immigrants that he had protected from deportation and college - aged women had been offered free contraceptives			2
' you can imagine for somebody making $ 25,000 or $ 30,000 or $ 35,000 a year , being told you ’re now going to get free health care , particularly if you do n’t have it , getting free health care worth , what , $ 10,000 per family , in perpetuity ? i mean , this is huge			2
' ' likewise , with @entity103 voters , free health care was a big plus , ' he added			2
' but in addition with regards to @entity103 voters , the amnesty for children of illegals , the so - called @entity107 kids , was a huge plus for that voting group			0
' @entity9 announced in june that he would grant temporary amnesty to some children of illegal immigrants who met certain requirements and had clean criminal records			0
the programme resembled the @entity107 , which had long been stalled in @entity116			0
this summer , @entity6 criticised @entity9 for waiting so long to deal with immigration reform , a 2008 election promise , lambasting that his ' amnesty ' programme as politically motivated			1
' he saves these sort of things until four - and - a - half months before the general election , ' he told @entity123			0
' i think the timing is pretty clear			0
if he really wanted a solution that dealt with these kids or illegal immigration in @entity45 , then this is something he would have taken up in his first three - and - a - half years , not in his last few months			0
' winner : @entity9 with his wife @entity131 and daughters @entity133 and @entity134 on @entity135 in @entity136 according to exit polls , @entity6 secured 59 per cent of the white vote while @entity9 was backed by 93 per cent of black voters , 71 percent of @entity103 and 60 per cent of voters younger than 30 , according to exit polls			1
on the conference call , @entity6 said that @entity9 directed his campaign according to the ' old playbook ' of targeting specific groups with promises of legislation that would persuade them to vote a certain way			1
' in each case they were very generous in what they gave to those groups			0
with regards to the young people , for instance , a forgiveness of college loan interest , was a big gift			0
' @entity162 contraceptives were very big with young college - aged women			0
and then , finally , @entity165 also made a difference for them , because as you know , anybody now 26 years of age and younger was now going to be part of their parents ’ plan , and that was a big gift to young people			0
' they turned out in large numbers , a larger share in this election even than in 2008 , ' he said			0
@entity36 , @entity6 's vice-presidential running mate , has blamed the @entity5 defeat on high turnout among urban voters			1
' i think the surprise was some of the turnout , some of the turnout especially in urban areas , which gave president @entity9 the big margin to win this race , ' he told a television station in @entity195			0
' when we watched @entity198 and @entity199 coming in , and those ones coming in as tight as they were , and looking like we were going to lose them , that ’s when it became clear we were n’t going to win			0
' @entity6 told his finance team that the sting of his loss was still too strong to begin mapping out his plans and the future of the party			1
' i am very sorry that we did n’t win			0
i know that you expected to win			0
we expected to win … it was very close , but close does n’t count in this business			0
' and so now we 're looking and saying , " @entity212 , what can we do going forward ? " but frankly we ’re still so troubled by the past , it ’s hard to put together our plans from the future			2
' representative @entity217 , a leading @entity218 , told @entity219 that he agreed with @entity1 ' that governor @entity6 's remarks were way off base '			1
and served as a reminder of the controversial ' 47 per cent ' video that was secretly taped at a private @entity33 fundraiser for @entity6 earlier this year			1
' there are 47 per cent of the people who will vote for the president no matter what , ' @entity6 said in the video			2
' all right , there are 47 per cent who are with him , who are dependent upon government , who believe that they are victims , who believe the government has a responsibility to care for them , who believe that they are entitled to healthcare , to food , to housing , to you name it			0
' my job is not to worry about those people			0
i 'll never convince them they should take personal responsibility and care for their lives			0

@entity1 said @entity6 's words ' do *n't* represent where we are as a party and where we ’re going as a party '
