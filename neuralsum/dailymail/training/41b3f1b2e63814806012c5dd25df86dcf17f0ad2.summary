by @entity0 and @entity1 ' would n't mind retiring ' : @entity2 said she would support a retirement age for peers to let new members into the increasingly full @entity6 former commons speaker @entity2 yesterday called for a retirement age to be introduced for elderly peers			1
amid claims that the @entity6 has run out of space , @entity2 said that the conditions have become ‘ appalling ’ and suggested that a time limit could be imposed on peers ’ length of service			1
a series of up to 20 new appointments are expected within days			0
this will boost the total number of peers to 850 – the highest level since most hereditary peers were removed following the @entity23 in 1999			2
yesterday peers told how officials have been ‘ prowling the corridors ’ looking for space to squeeze in more desks for the new recruits			1
‘ unseemly fights ’ in the chamber have been reported because there are not enough seats for the rising number of peers			2
@entity2 said : ‘ it is so overcrowded that there is only space for two thirds of us in the chamber itself			2
‘ all prime ministers are very keen to put new members in here so they get their legislation through and they pile them in irrespective			0
‘ it is what i call lobby fodder , they go through the lobbies and vote for the prime minister who put them there			0
’ she called for ‘ proper reform ’ so there would be ‘ a retirement age or a number of years they should perform here ’			1
speaking to @entity62 ’s @entity63 , the 84 - year - old added : ‘ i ’m getting on and i would n’t mind putting my hand up for a certain retirement age if it comes to it			1
’ lords speaker @entity68 said a life peerage should not be a ‘ life sentence ’			0
she told the programme : ‘ one of the things i want to do is to try to create a culture where it is seen as a public duty to retire in order to allow fresh blood to come in			2
‘ in practice it [ the increasing number of peers ] means the chamber is very crowded			2
at @entity86 there are sometimes some rather unseemly fights … there is quite a lot of competition and a lot of resentment that builds out of that			0
’ the @entity6 has been forced to squeeze in a further 121 desks in the past five years to the offices it has in buildings around @entity96 as it tries to accommodate all the peers			1
squeezy does it : a packed @entity6 chamber during a @entity96 ceremony @entity102 ’s @entity101 , who has called for the number of peers to be reduced to 450 and a retirement age of 80 to be introduced , said the situation had become a joke			1
he said : ‘ the @entity109 chief whip has been prowling the corridors to see where they can pack in more peers			1
people have come round with tape measures to see how big the offices are so they can work out if they can fit in another desk			0
‘ the chamber is near to overflowing			0
during @entity86 it is more and more difficult to get in			0
the library is getting increasingly overstretched , it is getting harder to find a seat			0
’ @entity121 has been increasing the number of @entity109 peers so that the @entity6 replicates the political balance in the @entity124			1
@entity101 said : ‘ if @entity102 win [ the next election ] and want to do the same thing the numbers will shoot up again			0

@entity2 , 84 , said conditions in the @entity6 are now ' appalling '
