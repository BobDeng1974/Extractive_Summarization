these are the jaw - dropping images that could have cost a courageous @entity3 photographer his life			2
@entity5 travelled to @entity6 in @entity7 in the hope of getting close - up snaps of @entity11 crocodiles in their natural habitat - and that 's exactly what he got			1
the nine foot long crocodile not only circled him , it got so close it nuzzled his camera and even touched him with its tail			0
he said : ' it was not an accidental meeting , the main purpose of my trip was to capture an @entity11 crocodile in its natural environment			1
' i met this crocodile underwater face to face			2
when it swam close to me , the only thought i had was about how great it was that i could take great pictures			1
' it nuzzled into the camera several times and sometimes it touched me with its tail			0
' walking like a crocodile : the reptile walks along the sea floor as it hunts for food stealth mode : the crocodile slides along the sea floor and can barely be seen amongst the marine plants @entity58 smile : mr @entity5 said when he spotted the reptiles he immediately jumped in the water and was in no hurry to get out mr @entity5 travelled to a remote fisherman 's hut and stayed there with a group of other photographers who hunted the crocodiles with their cameras			1
he said : ' when crocodiles came close to our hunt , i immediately jumped into the water with my camera and spent as much time as possible			0
' sometimes they stayed for three hours			0
of course it is deadly , crocodiles are dangerous wild animals			0

@entity5 hunted the crocodiles as they *searched* for food
he said coming face - to - face with the reptile was ' not an accidental meeting '
and that his only thought was ' how great it was ' to capture the pictures
