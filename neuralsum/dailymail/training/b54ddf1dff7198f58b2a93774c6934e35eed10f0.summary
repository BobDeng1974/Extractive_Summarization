by @entity0 , @entity1 , @entity2 and @entity3 published : 11:48 est , 21 january 2013 updated : 18:47 est , 21 january 2013 @entity4 is to send spy planes , unmanned drones and special forces to @entity8 to ‘ find and dismantle ’ the @entity10 network behind the slaughter in @entity12			1
in an escalation of the @entity4 ’s support for @entity17 forces fighting the militants in the @entity20 country , @entity13 said he would commit ‘ intelligence and counter terrorism assets ’			1
the prime minister said the @entity4 must ‘ act with an iron resolve ’ to tackle what he called a ‘ generational struggle ’ against the ‘ scourge of terrorism ’ after the @entity12 attack			1
they will target @entity10 affiliated groups including the @entity47 , led by one - eyed @entity48 and behind the atrocities at the @entity51 gas facility			0
mr @entity13 will also give the green light to sending around 20 soldiers – including members of the @entity55 – to join a 500 - strong force to train @entity8 troops and provide force protection			0
the @entity4 is also considering offering to refuel @entity17 fighter aircraft with @entity61 and @entity62 planes operating out of @entity63 and @entity64			1
mr @entity13 said @entity4 was ' in the midst of a generational struggle against an ideology which is an extreme distortion of the @entity69 faith ' and two @entity71 transport aircraft , already ferrying @entity17 hardware to the war zone , will be made available for several months if necessary			1
the prime minister explained he is prepared to commit military assets because the @entity80 region of @entity81 is ‘ becoming a magnet for jihadists who pose a threat to @entity4 ’			1
‘ this murderous violence requires a strong security response , ’ he said			2
‘ we will contribute @entity4 intelligence and counter-terrorism assets to an international effort to find and dismantle the network that planned and ordered the brutal assault			1
’ but a @entity91 poll for @entity92 last night suggested mr @entity13 has not yet secured public backing for another foreign military adventure that already shows signs of ‘ mission creep ’			0
by a margin of 36 per cent to 23 per cent , voters think events in @entity8 could threaten @entity4 , but just 18 per cent want to see @entity4 ground troops committed to the fight			1
just one in four voters says the @entity4 should offer whatever military support is necessary and 41 per cent think @entity4 should not play ‘ any role ’			1
in a stark warning , mr @entity13 told mps : ‘ together with our partners in the region , we are in the midst of a generational struggle against an ideology which is an extreme distortion of the @entity69 faith , and which holds that mass murder and terror are not only acceptable but necessary			0
‘ we must tackle this poisonous thinking at home and abroad and resist the ideologues ' attempt to divide the world into a clash of civilisations			2
’ he said @entity4 must pursue a ‘ patient , intelligent but tough approach ’ to defeat terrorism and ensuring national security			1
he warned a military response would not be sufficient , and urged governments in north and @entity128 to work together to defeat terrorist ' franchises ' in the region			0
mr @entity13 promised that during the @entity4 's chairmanship of the @entity133 this year he would put ' terrorism and how we respond to it ... right at the top of the agenda '			1
he told @entity112 that there were 800 employees working at the @entity141 site at the time of the attack , including around 135 foreign nationals			0
at least 12 were killed with at least a further 20 unaccounted for and feared dead , he said			0
' the @entity12 prime minister has said today 37 foreign hostages were killed			1
the number of terrorists was over 30			0
most were killed during the incident but a small number are in @entity12 custody			2
' the first of the @entity4 victims to be officially named was 46 - year - old @entity154 , reported to be a former @entity156 soldier and @entity158 veteran who was in charge of security at the @entity141 plant			2
mr @entity154 was described by his mother @entity163 , 65 , and partner @entity164 , 36 , as a ' true gentleman ' who died doing the job he loved			0
@entity167 , a 59 - year - old from @entity168 , @entity169 , who lived in @entity171 with his wife and two daughters , and @entity174 , 49 , a married father of two from @entity176 , who was a system supervisor for @entity51 at the @entity141 plant , were also killed			0
a further three @entity4 are believed to be dead , mr @entity13 said , along with @entity178 , a @entity179 executive for @entity51 who lived in @entity180			0
' now our most vital work is bringing home those who died			2
an international team of @entity4 , @entity43 and @entity186 experts is in close co-operation with the @entity12 ministry of justice undertaking the task of formally identifying their bodies , ' he said			1
' we want this process to happen as swiftly as possible but it will involve some intensive forensic and policing work and so may take some time			0
' all 22 @entity4 nationals caught up in the attack who either escaped or were freed have been safely returned to @entity4 , to be debriefed by the police and , of course , reunited with their families			0
terrifying : this image shows the moment that workers were first taken captive by @entity10 terrorists at the remote plant in @entity12 there was a marked change of tone from mr @entity13 's statement on friday , when he made clear his unhappiness at not being informed by the @entity12 pm about a rescue attempt until it was underway			2
mr @entity13 said : ' i am sure the @entity213 will understand the challenges that @entity12 faced in dealing with over 30 terrorists bent on killing innocent people in a large and extremely remote and dangerous industrial complex			2
' this would have been a most demanding task for security forces anywhere in the world and we should acknowledge the resolve shown by the @entity12 in undertaking it			1
' labour leader @entity224 said the attack in @entity12 was ' pre-meditated , cold - blooded murder of the most brutal kind '			0
' and behind each lost life is a family of loved ones who are in our thoughts today			0
' he said the new threat facing the @entity235 was ' more decentralised , more fragmented ' and ' taking advantage of the ungoverned spaces and security vacuum in parts of @entity81 '			0
one - eyed fugitive : @entity48 , an @entity12 who fought against @entity243 forces in @entity244 in the 1980s , has reportedly claimed responsibility for the kidnapping of up to 41 foreigners at an @entity12 gas field watch : @entity13 's @entity32 statement on the @entity12 hostage crisis			1
