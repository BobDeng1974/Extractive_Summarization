a teenage girl who cries and sweats blood has been dismissed by medics as suffering from a mental illness for five years			1
finally , one doctor has vowed to cure her incredible condition			1
@entity6 , 15 , from @entity7 , @entity8 , has suffered from the bizarre illness since she was violently sick one day in november 2009 and her eyes and skin began to ooze blood			1
her parents took her to hospital , assuming it was an infection and confident it would be cured			2
now , five years later , they have pinned their hopes on a top doctor in @entity7			1
' many doctors think that my daughter is mad but we have seen her suffer , ' said @entity23 , 35			1
' we 're desperate for her to live a normal life			1
we have no idea what is wrong with her and we just want a doctor to cure her			1
i started crying and thinking what is wrong with me ? what will happen to me ? ' there were many questions in my mind but my dad reassured me that everything would be fine and convinced me it was an infection			2
' for the next 12 months the strange symptoms did not occur			1
but in 2010 , it started again - blood seeped from her ears , scalp , fingernails , hands , legs , balls of her feet and eyes			1
she added : ' i know when my eyes will start bleeding because they 're really painful			1
but once the blood flows out the pain goes and they relax , it 's like a build up of pressure and then it 's gone			1
' in other parts of my body like my legs , palms and feet , they start itching intolerably			0
it 's like a burning sensation			0
and i sometimes get ulcers in my mouth before any bleeding starts			0
these are always the same symptoms , no matter how small , i know when the bleeding is about to start			0
' this phenomenon , which is only experienced by a handful of people around the world , has left @entity80 depressed and reluctant to mix with friends and live a normal teenage life			1
@entity6 's mysterious symptoms have been dismissed by doctors in @entity8 who say she has psychiatric issues , but after five years , one doctor is determined to cure her and give her a normal life ' i used to think why is this happening to me ? is there anything wrong with me ? i just could n't believe that my eyes were bleeding			1
was i a freak ? will i lose my eyesight ? what will happen to me ? but thankfully my eyesight is still perfect and i do not have any troubles with my hearing either , ' @entity6 said			1
' my friends are thankfully very supportive			0
they understand that i have a rare disease and have never embarrassed me			0
' there have been times when my school shirt has turned red because of the bleeding but my teachers immediately send me to the medical room and call my parents			0
' her father , @entity106 , who works for the government and earns 36,000 rs a month ( £ 370 ) , has spent 700,000 @entity109 ( £ 7,000 ) seeing hundreds of consultants all over @entity8			1
he said : ' i 've taken my daughter to the best ent specialists , hematologists , medical specialists but doctors have failed to diagnose her condition			1
' my daughter is a very intelligent girl			0
she is not lying about this bleeding in order to seek our attention			0
i have seen her going through the trauma			0
' i feel helpless when she starts bleeding all of a sudden and i can not do anything to stop it			0
many suggest she has psychiatric issues and have referred her to a psychiatrist			0
' some of them accuse her of scratching her skin so bad it bleeds or killing animals and smearing their blood all over her body			1
but who would ever do such a thing to draw attention ? since 2010 , @entity6 has had blood periodically seep from her ears , scalp , fingernails , hands , legs , balls of her feet and eyes ' they say no such disease exist in the world and turn us away			1
it 's a failure of the medical science that no reason has found for this condition			1
' the bleeding it is not typical blood , he said			2
it 's a mix of liquid and quite thin , and the flow can last one or two hours , or days			0
@entity6 added : ' some people have said ghosts or evil spirits possesses me			1
' i do n't know what i 'd do without my dad			0
he 's my biggest support			0
he 's made me strong emotionally and has always assured me that i am just a normal girl			2
he tells me i will fine soon			0
and i trust he will not stop until someone helps me			0
' @entity106 had spent many sleepless nights along with his wife @entity173 , 34 , researching their daughter 's nightmare			0
' i could n't find anyone else with the same disease as my daughter but recently i got the chance to meet the mother of a girl who is also suffering the same			0
it was a huge relief			0
' i came to know about dr @entity184 through a newspaper article			1
he is the first doctor who has given us some hope			0
it 's been a long fight but we will fight confidently and one day we will succeed			2
i have confidence in this doctor and i believe he will cure my daughter			2
' dr @entity184 , a @entity192 , at @entity193 , in @entity7 , said : ' this child has a very mysterious disorder called @entity196 , which essentially means that the child has spontaneous episodes of bleeding from anywhere in the body			1
' it can be the eyes , forehead , ears , and nose			2
it may involve certain systems like sweat glands or the capillary systems because after the bleeding there is absolutely no bruise , no cuts , and no marks			0
' it 's such an enigmatic condition that we know very little			2
no scientific doctor has been able to pinpoint this condition			2
' while the reason for this condition is not known , calling the patient an attention seeker would be wrong			2
i have seen her bleeding from the palms , eyes and ears during and i can say that this disorder definitely exists but we are yet to find out the reasons for it			2
' even if it is a psychiatric condition , i am interested to know why ? until we get to the bottom of this case i will not stop			2
' as a physician , i 'm emotionally attached to every case and as this child is one of the biggest challenges i have ever seen it intrigues me and i 'll work much harder to help			0
