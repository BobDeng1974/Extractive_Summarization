the @entity0 invented one of the world 's favourite foods , sushi , and are mad on their iphones			1
combine the two , thought one mad - cap @entity0 designer and businessman , and we 'll have the perfect item - the sushi phone			1
by crafting perfect imitations of @entity0 food to adorn @entity12 covers @entity15 says he is helping @entity12 fans watch videos on their handsets with ease as the sushi doubles as a stand , while making a style statement			1
the fake sushi looks incredibly realistic , such as this giant piece clasped to a fan 's ear ( left ) and a fried shrimp sushi model on in @entity12 cover ( right ) this piece of sushi roll looks almost good enough to eat - but it 's actually made by fake food artisans you can certainly believe creator @entity15 when he says : ' i love sushi so very , very much ' the food items such as chunky maguro tuna sushi help the @entity12 to stand upright and facilitate the phones use of as a mini monitor says @entity15 , who also runs a kerosene heater factory near @entity40 when he 's not creating new start - ups			1
crafted in the fashion of customised mobile cases - a style @entity0 call decoden - the 33 - year - old designer wanted to celebrate 16 years since the birth of the mobile internet revolution in @entity0 and his love of sushi			1
' i love sushi so very , very much , so my passion for raw fish made me want to create these cases , for sushi lovers all over the world			1
' i think everyone can have a laugh just looking at these funny crazy cases , ' he said			0
mr @entity15 's case covers are made by the same fake food artisans who create the realistic displays of food outside some restaurants in @entity0 to entice customers inside			1
such displays are also a gift to @entity71 speaking visitors who would otherwise be clueless about the diner 's menu			0
so realistic and appealing are some of the items that a tourist trade has sprung up around collectors who want to take the plastic food home with them			2
once made from wax , now high quality plastic resin is used instead and carefully sculpted to look like the actual dishes			0
you can really stand out from the crowd with these accessories , like this copy of amaebi , or sweet shrimp customisation of phones , known as decoden , is big business in @entity0 - though sushi is n't always involved ' each @entity12 case is handmade so i wo n't be producing a lot of them , ' says mr. @entity15			1
' but i hope to have them on the market next month through @entity101 ; selling a few thousand every month			0
' he has so far come up with a few sushi favourites as well as other @entity0 standards such as deep fried prawns and hamburger steaks			1
personalised customisation of phones , known as decoden , is big business in @entity0			2
it took off at about the same time as the launch of the world 's first commercial mobile internet service by @entity114 , called i - mode , 16 years ago this month			0
years ahead of its time with mobiles that made foreign competition look like toddler 's toys , @entity114 's imode and its phones were the forerunners of today 's apps and app - ecosystems			0
@entity127 in the region of 10 billion yen a year decoden , a portmanteau of ' decoration ' and the @entity0 word for phone ' denwa , is crossing @entity0 's borders into @entity136 and inspiring smart phone personalisation elsewhere			1
@entity139 printing has added new opportunities to the personalisation of phones , tablets and other electronics , enabling designers to make perfect renditions of their work at a fraction of the cost of hand crafting			0
high quality plastic resin is carefully sculpted to look like actual sushi , then attached to the phones ' when you 're living in @entity156 surrounded by 30 million familiar faces , you value things which help you stand out ' so those @entity0 with more dash than cash are learning how to achieve a blinged - out look @entity161 - style , while demanding more from their pocket rockets – in @entity0 it 's a wallet , a tv , a teacher , opens doors , as well as a style statement			2
' @entity0 has a culture of charms and trinkets ( ' omamori ' etc ) which mobile phones bring into the 21st century			2
add to that , @entity0 ( especially young @entity0 ) put more effort into display			2
' when you 're living in @entity156 surrounded by 30 million familiar faces , you value things which help you stand out , even if it 's a small and innocuous trinket , ' says @entity177 of the consultancy @entity178			0
some are given to lavishly decorating their phones with @entity182 gems or a $ 70 @entity184 - designed strap for their beloved phones			0
others look to brands like cute food - like - accessories maker q - pot that sells thousands of its melted chocolate - themed covers at $ 50 a go			0
commuters often yank out their cell phones to reveal sweet - like mascots hanging from the antennae , heart - shaped decoils , even hand painted butterflies			0
they also sport personalised screen savers , ringtones and dabbled with changeable faceplates			0
@entity0 has a culture of charms and trinkets , known as omamori ' , which phones bring into the 21st century you can even get sushi - shaped earrings and a key - ring - all part of the bizarre @entity0 craze @entity0 has become so mad about its mobiles they have even slowed the national walking pace as the nation peers into their hand - helds to check their emails and surf the net			1
the country practically invented the smartphone and the mobile internet 16 years ago this month - long before the @entity12 and even @entity221 existed			2
leaving the market for @entity0 mobile phone technology in the doldrums @entity114 was good at pulling it all together in @entity0 but when the operators and manufacturers exported their ideas they stumbled because they were n't very good at building relationships with foreign carriers , ' says mr @entity177 on why @entity0 was unable to capitalise on its its head start with smartphones and mobile internet			1
but @entity0 remains queen of the decodenas , as its mobiles receive makeovers that would make @entity239 blush			0
' it 's all about love ' says the manager of @entity0 's biggest mobile accessory outfit – and it might be coming to a deserving smartphone near you soon .			2
