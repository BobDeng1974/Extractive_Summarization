@entity0 is much - maligned for his poor scoring record at @entity2 , where his 46 goals cost more than £ 1million per strike			1
now he has returned to his boyhood club @entity6 , surely his fortunes will improve , right ? well if his first training session on loan from @entity9 is anything to go by , perhaps not			1
in front of the cameras in @entity13 , at @entity6 's training ground , @entity0 struggled to hit the target - scoring just one of his five headed attempts in a shooting drill			2
@entity0 sprinted through hoops before directing five headers at goal , unfortunately only one went in the @entity23 striker was all smiles as he spoke to coach @entity25 , despite his poor performance @entity0 leaps for the ball during the training session , aiming to divert his header into the goal in front of him the @entity32 connects well with the header , as two @entity6 coaches watch on from the side unfortunately , the ball ends up wide of the target , leaving the coach stretching to receive it @entity0 ' goalscoring record at @entity2 does not look good : @entity41 : 20 goals in 110 games domestic cups : 7 goals in 19 games @entity48 competitions : 19 goals in 43 games total : 46 goals in 172 games the clip will fuel @entity2 fans ' views that ridding themselves of ' @entity0 ' was the right decision , while @entity6 coach @entity57 will have a tough job on his hands instilling confidence back to the @entity62 striker			1
at @entity63 he was prolific , proving himself worthy of a £ 50million move to west @entity65 in 2011			0
he scored 65 goals in 102 appearances at @entity68 , and became a fans favourite in his three - and - a - half years there			0
but where did it all go wrong ? @entity57 will , of course , be hoping that a return to the club where it all began and where he scored 84 goals in 214 matches will ignite something in @entity0 , a passion that will inspire him to score plenty in @entity81			0
but , for now , it seems @entity0 is still unable to find the back of the net			0
@entity0 started his career at @entity6 , where he is pictured coming up against @entity87 's @entity86 @entity0 , pictured in december 2013 , celebrates after scoring one of his 20 goals for @entity2 the former @entity63 striker ( centre , pictured in 2010 ) signed for @entity9 this week , from @entity2			2
