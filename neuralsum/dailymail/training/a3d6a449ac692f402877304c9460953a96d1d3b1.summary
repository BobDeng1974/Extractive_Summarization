the first time really is important			0
the quality of your first sexual experience colours your sex life for years to come , researchers say			1
specifically , those who felt loved and respected by their partner found later encounters more emotionally satisfying			1
the study , @entity9 , is one of the first to look at whether the circumstances in which someone loses their virginity have lasting consequences			2
lasting consequences : the quality of your first sexual encounter colours your sex life for years to come , a new study shows the @entity20 researchers asked 331 young men and women about how they lost their virginity , including whether they felt scared , pressured , guilty or regretful			1
they were also asked about how connected they felt to their partner , including whether they felt respected and loved , and how they felt afterwards			1
the volunteers , who answered the questions anonymously , were then asked to fill in an online diary detailing any sexual experiences they had over the next fortnight			2
they were also asked how they would rate their sexual relationships overall			2
in more than two - thirds of cases , the volunteers said they were in a relationship when they lost their virginity			1
analysis of their answers showed that those who were most emotionally satisfied the first time still found their sex lives the most fulfilling			1
the same was true of physical satisfaction			0
a better first time also tended to lead to fewer feelings of disappointment , the @entity41 is to report			0
fulfilment : researchers claim a person 's first time has implications for their sexual wellbeing years later researcher @entity51 , of the @entity52 , said : ‘ these results suggest that one ’s first - time sexual experience is more than just a milestone in development			2
‘ rather , it appears to have implications for their sexual well - being years later			0
’ co-researcher @entity59 , of the @entity60 , said that while the study does n’t prove that a better first time makes for a better sex life in general , a person ’s experience of losing their virginity may set the pattern for years to come			2
' the happier the experience initially , on the whole , the happier in future ' @entity73 author dr @entity72 ‘ in essence , first - time sexual experience may create a general pattern of thought and behaviour that we use to guide us in new sexual experiences and a framework for our understanding , perception or interpretation of new information concerning sexuality			0
’ those taking part in the study were relatively young but the researchers said it is ‘ highly plausible ’ that the same would be true decades later , with someone ’s sex life in their 40s reflecting their experiences in their teens			1
dr @entity72 , an agony aunt and author of @entity73 , said their theory rings true			0
‘ the happier the experience initially , on the whole , the happier in future			0
it just kind of sets you up for good experiences			0
‘ i also find that when people who had first - time experiences they felt unhappy about , perhaps they felt pressurised , or too young , or felt used because they thought the person was in love with them too but the feeling was n’t reciprocated , it sets a pattern for feeling they are more likely to make bad choices in future			1
‘ losing your virginity is such an important aspect of our development as people , that if your first time is poor , rather than learning from it , a lot of people harbour the negative feelings			0
’ previous studies have concluded that most people have sex for the first time between the ages of 15 and 17 , with men more likely to enjoy the experience than women			1
in one study , only around a quarter of females said they were ‘ considerably ’ or ‘ extremely ’ satisfied physically - the response given by around two - thirds of the men			0
men also found the experience more psychologically satisfying , although the gap between the sexes was smaller .			1

researchers in the @entity20 asked *hundreds* of young men and women about how they lost their virginity
those who felt loved by their partner found later encounters more emotionally satisfying
