when @entity1 shows friends her new yellow diamond nestling in its jewellery box , they never fail to be impressed			1
‘ people always say how sparkly it is and compliment me on the fabulous colour , ’ says @entity1 , 63 , a retired @entity5 from @entity6			1
‘ they ’re so surprised when i tell them the diamond used to be my husband @entity12			2
‘ i paid £ 5,000 to have a laboratory turn his ashes into the gem as a way to keep him close to me after he died			1
for £ 3,000 , you can have your ashes pressed into vinyl records , or mixed with paint and painted into a favourite scene			1
ashes can also be shot into space , floated out to sea in a model ship or even encased in concrete and turned into part of a man - made reef off the @entity42 coast — a scheme created by @entity44 for families to encase their loved ones ’ ashes in concrete ‘ bereavement balls ’ and added to the reef , providing a home for marine wildlife			1
when @entity12 died in 2011 , aged 64 , following a long battle with throat and liver cancer , @entity1 spent months wondering what to do with his ashes			1
‘ although we had been married for 42 years , we never discussed in detail what we wanted if either of us should die , ’ she says			0
‘ his ashes sat by the side of my bed for 18 months , while i struggled with my grief			2
despite beiing married for 42 years she says they never discussed in detail what they would do if one of them died			0
‘ i eventually decided to scatter them under the willow tree in our garden , but then i remembered a friend of mine who ’d told me she planned to have her husband ’s ashes turned into a diamond if anything happened to him			1
‘ i liked the idea i could take a little piece of @entity12 with me wherever i went			0
after months of research , i contacted @entity82 in @entity83 and ordered a .75 carat canary yellow gem			2
all i needed to do was send off 100g of @entity12 ’s ashes by recorded post , and pay a deposit of £ 2,500			1
’ turning ashes into a diamond is fairly straightforward , as both are comprised of the same substance : the element carbon ( the human body is 18 per cent carbon , and the rest is mostly water )			0
natural diamonds are formed underground when carbon is put exposed to huge amounts of heat and pressure			0
laboratory - grown diamonds are made by creating the same forces artificially			1
@entity1 says her friends always admire the £ 5,000 yellow diamond she had made out of @entity12 's ashes first , the ashes are heated to 1,300c until they become molten , then they are compressed at 10,000 tons per square inch for several weeks until they form a diamond crystal , which is chemically indistinguishable from a natural stone			1
because the chemical make - up of each person ’s ashes is unique , so is the size , clarity and precise colour of the stone that emerges			0
however , the natural colour of diamonds made from human ash is broadly canary yellow due to the nitrogen content in the ashes			1
these yellow laboratory diamonds sell for about £ 6,500 per carat — around 40 per cent less than the equivalent natural diamond , which costs more because it takes thousands of years to form , is scarce and has to be mined			2
once the diamond crystal has been formed , it is cut and polished in the same way as a natural diamond would be			0
@entity1 waited 12 weeks for her diamond to be delivered			2
‘ my youngest son @entity131 , 29 , who works in finance , was incredibly suspicious of the whole process and insisted on being there when the diamond was delivered , ’ she says			0
‘ he drove the courier to our local jeweller to have the gem tested before he ’d let me pay the balance			0
’ @entity1 is now hoping to get her diamond set into a ring , and plans to leave it to her daughter @entity143 , 31 , in her will			2
‘ @entity12 would have laughed at my extravagance , as i am pretty frugal by nature , but i feel it ’s an important , lasting and very personal tribute to my beloved husband			0
’ cremation expert @entity149 says that memorialising a loved one — whether that means having some of their ashes made into a paperweight or even decanted into cartridges and fired from a shotgun — can be incredibly cathartic			2
‘ @entity156 is that you feel you have chosen a fitting resolution for that person , your family and friends , ’ he says			0
@entity162 in her garden with the £ 645 sculpture that contains her late husband @entity165 's ashes not all ‘ cremorials ’ are as subtle as @entity1 ’s diamond			1
when visitors step into @entity162 ’s manicured garden , the first thing they comment on is the striking modern sculpture , in the shape of a closed flower bud , rising from her rockery			1
‘ of course , they ’re a little taken aback when i tell them : “ that ’s @entity165 — my late husband ” , ’ says @entity162 , 60 , a company director from @entity177 , @entity178			1
@entity165 , who ran a successful record label , was 68 when he died peacefully at home in november 2011 from lung cancer with @entity162 , son @entity185 , now 44 , and daughter @entity186 , 40 , by his side			1
once his funeral was over , @entity162 was at a loss as to what to do with his remains			2
‘ it was just too difficult to talk about once he became ill , ’ says @entity162			2
‘ the ashes were handed over to us a few days afterwards in an ugly plastic jar			0
i found it so painful to look at , i hid it in the garage for more than a year			0
’ a year on , @entity162 and @entity186 decided to scatter some of the ashes in the garden of the family ’s holiday home in @entity205			1
‘ we thought about scattering the rest around our garden in @entity208 , but i quickly realised that if i ever moved house , it would mean leaving @entity165 behind for good , ’ says @entity162			1
‘ after searching online , we decided on a memorial ornament instead — something that would be a tangible reminder of @entity165 but portable , too			1
we bought it online from a specialist company called scattering ashes for £ 645 and had a small plaque made for it with @entity165 ’s name on			1
‘ it has an internal sphere that @entity186 and i carefully opened and decanted the ashes into at the kitchen table			0
‘ i thought i would find that hard to do , but it was actually very cathartic			0
now , every time i pop out to snip a few herbs for my cooking , i see the sculpture and feel connected to @entity165			1
‘ i sometimes wonder if he would be happy with what i ’ve done — but i love the sculpture , and i ’m sure he would be glad about that			0
’ @entity233 , 42 , with mum @entity234 whose last wish was that her family would have a party celebrating her life and send her ashes up in fireworks increasingly , people are leaving instructions in their wills about how they would like their ashes used			2
@entity233 ’s mother , @entity243 , 73 , a retired market researcher , was very clear about what she wanted before she passed away from long - standing health problems on april 25			1
‘ @entity252 told me in no uncertain terms that she did not want a religious funeral , nor should anyone attend the crematorium , ’ says @entity233 , a 42 - year - old student nurse and mother to @entity247 , 19 , @entity248 , 12 , and @entity249 , nine , from @entity250 in @entity251			0
@entity233 says she could n't think of a better send off for her late mother ‘ instead , she left £ 6,000 from a funeral savings plan for us to throw a big party to celebrate her life			0
‘ she said she wanted to have her ashes sent up in a firework display over @entity263 , in the middle of the @entity265 at @entity266			1
it ’s the site of a famous jazz club that she used to love going to in the @entity269			0
‘ my sisters @entity271 , @entity272 and i desperately wanted to hold the wake on her birthday , may 9 , ’ says @entity233			0
‘ it was all a bit of a rush , but we managed to courier some of @entity252 ’s ashes to @entity280 fireworks in @entity281 , @entity282			2
‘ they transferred around an egg cup - full into a large firework — a complete display in one package — at a cost of £ 249			1
‘ we organised a big group of family and friends to meet in a local pub , and then walk , accompanied by a @entity294 - style jazz band , to the @entity266 rowing club			0
‘ there were eulogies and poetry readings then , as it started to get dark , my eldest son lit the fuse on the firework display			0
‘ there were two minutes of spectacular flashes , bangs and colours as the fireworks scattered @entity252 ’s ashes over the island she loved			2
‘ as the fireworks came to an end everyone cheered , clapped , whistled and yes , shed a few tears			0
‘ what better send - off could anyone ask for ? ’			0
