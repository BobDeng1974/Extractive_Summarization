@entity130 ’s public transport campaigner @entity203 said : ' yet again , the government is hiking up commuter rail fares			0
ticket prices are rising much faster than wages , which means getting to work takes up an increasing share of incomes , hitting both household budgets and the economy			0
' the government urgently needs to adopt a fairer approach to ticketing , bringing fares down and introducing more flexible tickets to help groups like the millions who work part - time			0
' rail union the @entity220 has also bemoaned the fare rise , which comes at a time when commuters have had to contend with constant late autumn and early winter disruptions to rush - hour services			1

the @entity220 published figures which it said showed that @entity213 subsidies to train companies came to just over £ 4 billion in 2012/13			0
@entity220 general secretary @entity239 said : ' as the travelling public gear up for the new year fares hike , we are blowing away the myth that the extra cash is invested back into services when in fact it combines with taxpayer subsidies to fuel a £ 4 billion privatised rail rip - off that is a one - way ticket to the bank for the train companies			1
' he went on : ' the scandal of the @entity3 people paying the highest fares in @entity255 to travel on clapped - out and overcrowded trains will be compounded by the new year average rise - an increase which dwarfs average pay increases and which will hit the poorest the hardest			1
' mr @entity239 said the @entity220 would step up the fight for the renationalisation of the railways			0
transport secretary @entity262 said today : ' we are investing in the biggest rail modernisation since the @entity266 era and fares have a crucial role to play in funding these improvements			0
this is because building better infrastructure helps create jobs , building a stronger economy for us all			0
' we recognise passengers ’ concerns about the cost of rail fares			0
this is why we have frozen them for the second year in a row			0
we are protecting passengers even further by stopping operating companies from increasing individual fares by up to 2 per cent more			0
” @entity283 , of campaign group @entity284 , said : ' chancellor @entity160 has yet again frozen fuel duty for motorists and with oil prices falling dramatically , motoring is becoming cheaper in real terms and rail travel becoming more expensive			0
' so do n’t be surprised if road congestion gets even worse along with pollution , accidents and global warming			0
' he went on : ' fares need to reflect reality in terms of inflation , and with the most recent figures for @entity303 inflation just 1 per cent and falling , this represents yet another unfair squeezing of rail passengers ’ wallets			0
' there ’s a real danger that further fare increases will deter passengers from travelling and reduce the rail industry ’s income , increasing the support required from government			0
' a spokesman for the @entity147 , which represents rail operators and @entity37 , said : ' at 2.2 per cent , the average increase in fares in 2015 is the lowest for five years			2
' we know that no one likes to pay more to go to work , but for every £ 1 spent on fares , 97p goes on track , train , staff and other costs while 3p goes in profits earned by train companies for running services on @entity255 ’s fastest - growing railway			0
' while we know and are very sorry that many passengers did not get the service they deserved at the weekend , @entity37 is spending £ 38 billion over five years on a better railway alongside commitments made by train companies to improve services			0
