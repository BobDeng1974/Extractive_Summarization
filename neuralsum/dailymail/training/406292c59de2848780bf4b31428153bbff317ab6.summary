by @entity0 published : 10:50 est , 23 september 2012 updated : 10:50 est , 23 september 2012 art experts will this week claim that @entity2 completed a version of the @entity4 some ten years before the famous painting which now hangs in the @entity6 in @entity7			1
known as the @entity9 , the painting is a slightly larger size than the famous portrait and has long been the subject of debate over its authenticity			2
however , the not - for - profit @entity15 , which was set up to conduct research into the work , is planning to put forward ' historical , comparative and scientific evidence ' that will prove once and for all that the painting is by the @entity23 renaissance artist			0
a fair likeness : art experts claim the @entity9 ( left ) is an earlier version of the @entity4 ( right ) the claims of the @entity28 - based consortium which owns the painting are supported by professor @entity30 , who has set up his own art museum in @entity2			1
he will present evidence alongside professor @entity33 of the @entity34 for @entity35 at the @entity36			0
the @entity9 was discovered shortly before the @entity37 by @entity38 , an @entity39 art collector , while looking through the home of a @entity42 nobleman			2
he bought the painting and took it to his studio in @entity45 , @entity46 , from which it takes its name			0
art critics conjectured that @entity2 had in fact painted two portraits of @entity52 , with one hanging in the @entity6 and the other now with mr @entity38			1
he in turn sold it to an @entity57 collector , @entity56 , who in turn left it to his girlfriend			0
on her death , it was bought by a consortium of unnamed individuals who have kept it in a @entity28 bank vault for 40 years			0
but despite claims the @entity9 is indeed the work of @entity2 , @entity69 , emeritus professor of the history of art at @entity73 disputes this			2
on display : @entity2 's @entity4 hangs at the @entity6 in @entity7 enigma : did @entity2 , as shown in this self portrait , complete an earlier version of his famous work , the @entity4 ? ' so much is wrong , ' he told @entity79			1
' the dress , the hair and background landscape			0
this one is also painted on canvas , which @entity2 rarely did			0
' like the majority of his works , the @entity4 in the @entity6 is in fact painted on wood			2
and while the lady in the @entity9 does appear to be a younger version of the model in the more famous painting , @entity69 said this did not prove the two were produced by @entity2			1
' she might look younger but this is probably because the copyist , and i believe it is a copy done a few years after the @entity4 , just painted it that way , ' added mr @entity69 .			1

experts will claim this week that @entity2 completed a version of the @entity4 ten years before the famous painting in the @entity6
the @entity9 features a similar , but younger looking woman than appears in the famous *original*
critics believe the painting is simply a copy of @entity2 's *masterpiece*
