thieves have taken off with the ten metre high @entity1 from a fruit - growing town in northern @entity3 , @entity4			1
the giant , bright orange replica of the famous @entity8 mango is one of @entity4 's iconic tourist attractions , and was the pride of @entity8 , before a team of robbers took off with it under the cover of darkness in the early hours of monday			1
security cameras appear to have captured the heist , in which the three - story painted metal mango was unbolted from the concrete platform on which it had stood since 2002 , rolled on to a heavy vehicle and driven off down @entity3 's @entity24			1
however , doubts have begun to emerge about the heist			0
@entity3 police say the theft has not been reported to them , although @entity29 is still insisting the icon is missing , and it is not a publicity stunt			2
fruit loops : thieves took off with the @entity1 ( above ) , a ten metre high tourist attraction from the @entity3 town of @entity8			1
police are examining clues , but a sighting suggests the stolen icon is on a large , unmarked crane heading south security footage shows an apparently masked thief on the premises near the @entity1 moving towards a large , unmarked crane , which @entity8 police now believe may be the getaway vehicle the daring heist happened in the early hours of monday morning , when the thief ( above , in the right of the picture ) and an accomplice unbolted the @entity1 from its concrete base and shifted the 10 tonne tourism icon onto a crane whoever removed the @entity1 was very well organised			1
tyre marks and a reported sighting suggest the @entity1 is on a large , unmarked mobile crane heading south			1
for the last 12 years , the @entity1 had sat towing the @entity8 tourist centre , four kilometres out of town			2
although @entity63 was installed to protect the tourist office from break - ins , no - one suspected anyone would take off with the orange fruit icon			2
in the rear light of the giant crane , one of the thieves can be seen signalling to the crane 's driver as the vehicle eases the @entity1 from its moorings the @entity63 footage of the alleged robbery ( above ) is being studied by police , along with tyre marks and a sighting of the vehicle heading south locals in the northern @entity3 town of @entity8 are at a loss as to what motives the @entity1 thieves had for stealing the pride of @entity8 in the middle of the night ' no one in their right mind considered for a second that someone would take a giant three - storey - high , 10 - tonne @entity91 , ' @entity87 chairman @entity86 told @entity92			1
' it ’s not like it ’s something that can be easily hidden			0
the @entity1 was the work of local @entity8 doctor , @entity97 , who established a @entity99 in the late 1990s to help fund and build it			0
the @entity91 went up in 2002 at a cost of $ 90,000 , 200 per cent over budget			0
mr @entity86 said he hoped the iconic tourist attraction would be returned unharmed , and with the help of the tyre marks and the security footage , police would soon unmask the thieves			2
he said local authorities were analysing the security footage for leads			0
@entity112 manager @entity111 was the first to notice when he arrived at work this morning – and assumed the @entity1 it must have been removed for repairs			0
but a call to mr @entity86 confirmed there was no planned maintenance – and an inspection found the mango had indeed been unbolted and stolen			0
motives for the theft remain unclear .			0
