@entity0 forward @entity1 needs protecting , not putting on a pedestal as @entity4 's next great hope , according to manager @entity5			1
the talented 19 - year - old has enjoyed a stellar nine months since regaining a place in the starting line - up , becoming one of the @entity11 ' stand - out performers and playing in his first @entity12			0
@entity1 has maintained that progress this season with his club , scoring twice in three matches , while also impressing in his last two matches for the national side			2
@entity1 trains ahead of @entity0 's fixture against @entity20 at @entity21 on saturday evening the @entity4 winger talks to manager @entity5 , who insists his young star needs to be protected however , @entity5 , who already has an issue with @entity4 over the injury which has ruled out striker @entity26 for up to three weeks , stressed the youngster should not be over-burdened with expectation			1
' i think he needs protection			0
i have seen it over the years , ' he said			0
' he is a wonderful talent , he is doing great for @entity0 but there are still a lot of things he needs to learn and he knows that and is a mature boy for his age			1
' he has grown into a wonderful young man and his consistency and performances are there and the period he has been in the team has been exceptional ' i expect him to keep progressing but in terms of where he is at i think we need to be careful			2
@entity5 has helped @entity1 mature into an international player , but he is not the finished article @entity1 starred for @entity4 again against @entity50 and is now a key player for his country ' you see so many players where there is a reliance on them - especially with @entity4 who , for whatever reason tend to look for one player to put up on a pedestal and very quickly knock him down			1
' @entity1 will make mistakes , he will have bad games but he will also have outstanding games and it is keeping the calmness with him because he still has a way to go			1
' he is certainly performing at a real high and consistent level			0
' @entity4 know as well as anyone they need a team so they do n't have to focus just on @entity1			1
' it has to be the team and that will always the winner for @entity4 when they come together and they were excellent against @entity50 ( in their 2 - 0 @entity76 qualifying victory ) as a team			2
' @entity26 is out for around three weeks after injuring himself during @entity4 training @entity5 says @entity1 should not be put up on a pedastal like other young englishmen @entity5 will hope @entity1 will again provide the attacking edge for his side against @entity20 on saturday in the absence of @entity26			1
there will be greater focus on summer signing @entity86 , who makes his home debut after a promising hour last time out against @entity90 , but @entity5 has to decide whom replaces his injured striker			2
@entity92 , bought from @entity93 for Â£ 4million at the end of last season , has made two brief substitute appearances and @entity5 ' vision was for him to be able to make an impact off the bench			1
however , it may come down to a choice between him and a tweaking of the system to accommodate another new signing @entity105			0
@entity92 ( centre ) could get his first @entity0 start in the absence of @entity26 ' @entity92 has been very good since he came in , ' said @entity5			1
' he has mostly had an impact from the bench and you see even with @entity4 the other night when he came on he showed good ability to play a great weighted pass for @entity114 to score			0
' he is working very well and if he does n't get a start he will certainly start against @entity116 in the ( @entity118 ) cup so his game time will come - but at the moment he is playing a great supporting role from the bench			0
' one player who is still some way off settling for a supporting role is captain @entity126 , who thanks to his international retirement has been able to enjoy a rest during the recent break			0
' after 14 years it was his first international break and it was great for him , ' said @entity5			2
' i gave him an extra few days off to recover knowing we have a real busy schedule coming up over these next couple of months but he looks after himself ever so well , a great professional			0
' last time @entity0 played @entity20 at @entity21 they needed a soft penalty to come back from 2 - 0 down @entity5 has had his difficulties at @entity21 against saturday 's opponents , taking just a point from his two previous encounters , so he is well aware of what awaits			1
' we deservedly lost in my first season and then we started slowly last season and showed real character to draw the game ( having trailed 2 - 0 )			0
' they have started well and i am pleased for @entity148 ( @entity92 ) because a few years ago when he went in there he looked towards building a young group of players and the first season was difficult			2
' but they have developed and grown and got better and this season will see them and their young players - and the faith they put in them - bear fruit			0

@entity5 says @entity4 rush to put pressure on young stars
@entity1 is a ' wonderful talent ' but ' will make mistakes '
@entity92 could start in absence of @entity26
@entity26 was injured on international duty with @entity4
