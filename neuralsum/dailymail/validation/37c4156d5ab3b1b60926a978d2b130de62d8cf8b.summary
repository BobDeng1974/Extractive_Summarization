marine biologist @entity0 has swam with some of the most fearsome creatures in the sea , including the terrifying hammerhead			1
but now he has hitched a ride on the whale shark , which can grow to more than 44ft long			1
however , despite its massive size , the whale shark is a filter feeder , devouring tonnes of plankton as it swims though warm parts of the ocean			2
despite the mammoth size of the whale shark , @entity0 said he had no fears about diving with the creatures , which can live to between 70 and 100 years old in the wild			1
@entity0 was helping marine biologists study the giant whale shark off the coast of @entity0 and his team were measuring the giant whales who were returning to the secret @entity26 location whale sharks can grow as long as 44ft but are not a danger to humans as they favor plankton my turn : @entity0 's girlfriend poses on the water with the huge beast right beside her he said : ' not at all , they are gentle giants			1
i was helping out a team of marine biologists conduct a survey on whale shark population estimates , to identify returning sharks year on year and to see growth rates of individuals			1
' we were out for three days on the whole and it was on the first evening that i was able to have such an amazing interaction with the largest shark			0
' the project is taking place at a secret location off the coast of @entity26			0
@entity0 has appeared on several reality tv survival - style shows in the @entity55			0
he added : ' i have previously been in the water with the hammerhead along with various other sharks			0
' as my passion and job revolves around amazing wildlife , i continue to seek encounters ( both in the water and out ) with all the most fantastic creatures i can			0
' unlike species such as the great white and tiger shark , the whale shark is very docile in the water and filters its food			2
biologists do not know why the whale shark has any teeth as it does not use them for feeding , although they are thought to have evolved more than 90 million years ago			0
@entity0 and his team were measuring the returning whale sharks to see how they had grown over a year when asked about swimming with the massive sharks , @entity0 said they were ' gentle giants ' @entity76 has appeared on several reality television survival - style shows in the @entity55 whale sharks can live for between 70 and 100 years in the wild and reach sexual maturity after 30 years			2

marine biologist @entity0 has filmed himself swimming with sharks
he dived off the coast of @entity26 with the giant whale shark for a study
the whale shark can grow to 44ft but only feeds on plankton
