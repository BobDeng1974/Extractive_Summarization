ambulance chiefs in @entity1 are today coming under intense pressure to improve after recording the worst set of emergency response figures in history			1
just 42.6 per cent of the most serious emergency ambulance calls reached their casualty within the stipulated eight minutes in december			1
that figure is down almost 10 per cent from november 's figure of 51 per cent			1
performance figures on those category a calls , which are deemed immediately life threatening , ranged from barely a quarter ( 28.3 per cent ) in @entity13 to 61.5 per cent in @entity14			1
the @entity23 dictates that 65 per cent of all emergency calls should be reached within eight minutes			1
@entity34 , interim chief executive at the @entity35 , said : ' we completely appreciate that this presents an unacceptable level of service delivery across the whole health and social care system			0
' an ageing population and more people with long - term illnesses means that more people than ever before are relying on our ambulance service			0
' that 's why we 're rolling out a host of innovative new projects to help ease the pressure			0
' ambulance crews in @entity1 were called to a total of 40,147 emergency calls in december - an increase of 11.2 per cent on november and 7.6 per cent up from december 2013			1
of these , 16,078 were triaged as @entity56 calls , meaning the patient was thought to be in a life - threatening condition			2
that figure is a rise of 14.3 per cent of @entity56 calls in november , and 9.3 per cent rise on the same period in 2013			2
one in 10 ambulances took 30 minutes or more to arrive in december , and one in five emergency ambulance responses took longer than 20 minutes to arrive			1
meanwhile figures from @entity1 this morning showed police forces in @entity1 had to take patients to @entity67 on 115 occasions in december			1
the interim chief executive of the @entity35 , @entity34 , said : ' we completely appreciate that this presents an unacceptable level of service delivery across the whole health and social care system ' if all of these cases should have been covered by ambulances as @entity56 calls , it would suggest that police are covering around 0.7 per cent of emergency medical cases			2
ms @entity34 said among the measures introduced to help the service cope is inviting @entity85 consulatants to join paramedics in rapid response cars to help assess patients and decide whether to take them to @entity85			0
and clinicans have been invited into ambulance control rooms , to ensure call handlers are sending the most appropriate resources to patients			0
in addition the @entity23 has set aside an additional £ 11 million funding to help the ambulance service cope with such high demand			1
a @entity23 spokesperson said : ' these figures demonstrate the immense pressure the @entity23 ambulance service was under throughout december			1
' the demand on the service was unprecedented			0
' they are nevertheless disappointing and there is no complacency about the need to improve performance			0
' the ambulance service 's own figures show it received a record high demand for an emergency response to patients in imminent danger of death - 10.8 per cent higher than the second highest number of @entity117 calls reported in december 2012			1
' leader of the @entity120 @entity119 , said : ' these figures are truly appalling and indicate the mess in which the health minister now finds himself			0
' clearly urgent action must now be taken to address the alarming decline in ambulance response times			0
' these are the worst response times on record and it is vital that the health minister works with all interested parties to address the very serious issues facing the ambulance service in @entity1			2
' despite the best efforts of dedicated @entity136 staff , ambulance response targets have not been met in @entity1 for several years but we appear to have reached a new low and mr @entity139 faces serious questions			2
' @entity141 was accused of trying to ‘ airbrush out ’ his party ’s shameful record on the @entity136 in @entity1 after it removed all references to the health service in leaflets sent out there			0
a @entity31 leaflet currently being sent to constituencies across @entity150 boasts about the party ’s ‘ plan for the @entity136 ’ and includes several images of nurses , doctors and hospitals			0
but the version being delivered to @entity23 homes makes no mention of the health service or @entity31 ’s record there .			0
