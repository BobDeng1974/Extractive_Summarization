a vitriolic letter written by the future @entity3 in which he branded the @entity5 @entity4 ' rotten ' and ' the completest passengers ' during a tour of the country has emerged 96 years later			1
the @entity3 - the eldest son of @entity9 and @entity10 - could not hide his resentment towards the @entity12 in the private letter he penned on a visit to @entity15			1
in the letter written a few months after @entity17 to his mistress @entity18 , the 25 - year - old @entity3 expresses his disgust at their reluctance to support the @entity22			1
resentment : the @entity3 , pictured in november 1919 during his tour of @entity4 , criticised the @entity5 @entity4 in a private letter calling them ' shirkers in everything particularly in war ' contempt : the future @entity3 scoffed at the @entity12 during his royal tour ( pictured here ) stinging : in the letters , @entity3 describes the @entity5 @entity4 as ' mostly a rotten priest - ridden community ' in the recently unearthed letter , he says : '' these bloody @entity5 @entity4			1
' the whole thing is a very delicate , imperial and political question which i do n't attempt to understand though i do know they are mostly a rotten priest - ridden community , who are the completest passengers and who wo n't do their bit in anything and of course the war ! ! ' after catching a train for @entity47 he wrote of how he was relieved to be leaving the @entity12			0
he added : ' they really are n't worth all the trouble i 've taken to be out of the way polite to them , as they are shirkers in everything particularly in war as they all voted against conscription			0
' the @entity17 divided @entity4 , with the @entity5 - speaking population accused of not doing enough to fight against the @entity58			1
later on in the letter to the married socialite , the @entity3 derided the attractiveness of the local women			1
he described one of his hostesses as ' pompous and interfering '			0
detailing a formal dinner he had attended , he quipped : ' few of the women are worth dancing with and far less are in any way attractive			0
' at another party at a yacht club , he complained how there were ' 100 very plain women ' there			0
disgust : @entity3 said the @entity12 ' really are n't worth all the trouble ' as they are ' shirkers , particularly war as they all voted against conscription ' - he is pictured here in @entity77 , @entity4 , in 1919 @entity5 @entity4 are a major @entity78 ethnic group and @entity4 citizens derived from the descendants of colonists from @entity82 who arrived in @entity82 ( @entity4 ) in the 17th and 18th centuries			1
when war was declared in 1914 , @entity4 automatically entered as it was part of the @entity22			2
but by 1917 @entity5 @entity4 only made up 21,000 out of 432,000 men , despite making up one third of the @entity4 population			1
the @entity5 @entity4 opposed conscription as they felt that they had no real loyalty to either @entity92 or @entity82			2
the six - page letter was written by the future @entity3 to married mother - of - two mrs @entity18 , years before he gave up the throne in order to marry @entity78 divorcee @entity97			1
then 23 , the socialite was married to @entity99 mp @entity99 , who apparently turned a blind eye to the affair			2
the letter is due to be sold tomorrow by @entity103 ( @entity103 ) at @entity104			0
it is expected to fetch Â£ 1,200 when it goes under the hammer			0
@entity108 , of @entity103 , said : ' the @entity3 was a very patriotic gentleman and was known for wearing his heart on his sleeve			0
' he obviously would have attended lots of dinners and events in @entity4 and gave very polite and diplomatic speeches but this letter to someone he trusted very much reveals his real innermost thoughts			2
' he still clearly felt troubled by the role played by the @entity12 in the @entity17 , feeling they shirked their responsibilities			0
' i am quite sure he intended these thoughts to remain private and never expected them to become public at any time			0
' @entity3 abdicated in 1936 ( pictured addressing the nation ) so he could marry @entity78 @entity97 @entity3 was an army officer during the @entity17			1
although as heir to the throne he was prevented from fighting , he made a number of moral - boosting trips to the @entity131 and was very popular with the troops			0
@entity3 was the @entity3 from 1911 until 1936 when he became @entity3 , a reign that only lasted 11 months when he abdicated so he could marry @entity78 @entity97			1
the @entity134 and many others opposed the union because @entity97 had already been divorced once and was in the process of divorcing her second husband , so the @entity3 chose to abdicate instead of giving up his lover			2
his younger brother @entity9 , who served in the @entity142 during the war , succeeded @entity3 as @entity3 in 1936 , the details of which are popularised in the film ' @entity145 ' starring @entity146 .			0
