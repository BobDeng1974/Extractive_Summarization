now the head of the @entity7 ’s largest examination board has become the latest to cast doubt over a-level and @entity11 standards			1
@entity12 , president of @entity7 , which owns @entity13 , said that boards should be ‘ worried ’ about the pattern of ever improving results			1
his comments come just weeks after @entity18 , chief executive of exam regulator @entity19 , admitted that a-levels and @entity11 had suffered ‘ persistent grade inflation ’ for ‘ at least a decade ’			1
easy deal ? but exams are set to get tougher after years of easier tests speaking to the @entity25 , mr @entity12 stopped short of agreeing there had been grade inflation			1
but he said : ‘ we have seen improvements in grades in gcses and a-levels in the past ten years – that is indisputable			2

‘ that must tell you that there is an issue we need to look at , to be worried about			0
’ a report published on monday by @entity45 , which acquired @entity13 in 2005 , called for a strict cap to be placed on the number of gcses taken by school children amid claims that exam overload was damaging pupils ’ education			2
it said limits should be introduced to ensure pupils sat no more than eight to ten gcses			0
it came after experts warned that teenagers were collecting gcses like ‘ scout badges ’			0
the @entity45 report also outlined plans for a new generation of tougher a-levels , which ‘ set the bar higher ’ with longer , essay - style questions			0

some teachers expected to receive ‘ privileged information ’ about exams , it claimed			0
yesterday , the regulator announced plans to change gcse grading and reduce the number of ‘ soft ’ subjects on offer			1
