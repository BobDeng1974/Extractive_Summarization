by @entity0 published : 11:17 est , 13 november 2013 @entity2 : 03:39 est , 14 november 2013 how many @entity4 sightings are actually drones ? according to paranormal expert @entity6 , far more than you might think			1
the @entity8 has reported that @entity4 sightings jumped by 42 per cent between 2011 and 2012			1
‘ the thing about drones is … that you can make them look like @entity4 , ’ mr @entity6 said			2
‘ you can go to the local hardware store , and for not a lot of money , you can pick up the materials you need … to make people go crazy			0
’ in september , for instance , spectators at the @entity30 in @entity31 , @entity32 , were stunned to spot what appeared to be a @entity4 in the sky			2
mysterious : the internet exploded with sightings of the ' alien spacecraft ' being driven along the @entity39 near @entity40 on the back of a truck at around 11 p.m. the blue object , adorned with the requisite flashing lights , appeared during the first game of the best - of - three @entity47 final between the @entity48 and @entity49			0
the @entity4 was in fact a drone flown by the @entity32 planetarium to deliberately fool spectators			1
another incident last year saw hundreds of people in @entity56 get the shock of their lives when they saw a @entity4 being transported across a local highway			1
many people tweeted pictures of the mysterious object alongside exclamations of concern and astonishment			0
military drone : a @entity68 aircraft takes off and flies for the first time on feb. 4 , 2011 , at @entity70 , @entity71 ‘ a ufo in @entity73 ! where ’s @entity75 when you need them ! ’ @ @entity77 said of the saucer - shaped vehicle			0
the ‘ alien spacecraft ’ was in fact an experimental @entity80 being driven along the @entity39 as it was moved from @entity81 to @entity82 in @entity73			0
the problem , noted mr @entity84 , is that many drones are deliberately designed to look like flying saucers			2
or , as many @entity4 enthusiasts might believe , that 's what they want you to think ...			0
the @entity8 has reported that @entity4 sightings jumped by 42 per cent between 2011 and 2012			1

@entity4 sightings increased by 42 per cent between 2011 and 2012
could be because many drones are designed to look like flying saucers
last year hundreds of people in @entity56 *mistook* a drone for a @entity4
a separate incident in september saw a ' flying saucer ' drone deliberately fool spectators at a *baseball* game
