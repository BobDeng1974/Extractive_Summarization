by @entity0 published : 17:51 est , 5 may 2012 updated : 18:03 est , 5 may 2012 ' it stinks ' : @entity2 is accused of exploiting her husband 's position in accepting the ' dream job ' offer in @entity6 she ’s posed naked except for a bedsheet , with the houses of @entity9 as her backdrop			1
she ’s taken part in celebrity big brother , and made a tabloid tv show about her friendship with @entity16 star @entity15			0
she ’s even admitted to being a former binge - drinker who had a string of one - night stands			2
you could be forgiven for thinking that @entity2 has already caused her husband , commons speaker @entity22 , enough embarrassment			1
but now she has given him a fresh headache after accepting a celebrity public speaking engagement , which she said came with a fee of ‘ about £ 2,000 ’ and a trip to the @entity31			0
the @entity32 offered her the ‘ dream job ’ just weeks after her husband allowed the organisation to host a @entity36 cocktail party in his official commons apartment			1
one @entity40 mp said the arrangement ‘ stunk ’ – and accused 42 - year - old @entity42 of profiting from her position			2
last night , the attention - loving mrs @entity2 claimed her £ 2,000 fee for the hour - long talk was ‘ not a fortune ’ – but admitted she leapt at the chance to address delegates at the five - star @entity50			1
she told @entity52 : ‘ they said , “ will you come and speak in @entity6 ? we will pay for your flights and accommodation			0
” ‘ i thought about it for five seconds and said , “ yes , please , i ’ll bite your arm off			0
” i ’m not crazy			0
’ she added that she was unaware whether the flights would be business class , saying : ‘ no idea			0
it does n’t matter to me			0
i am quite happy to go economy			0
‘ i ’ll take what i ’m given			0
’ the offer to mrs @entity2 came after the trade body was permitted to hold two @entity36 parties at mr @entity22 ’s grace - and - favour @entity71 home , one in 2010 and another last year			1
at the 2010 event , mr @entity22 himself reportedly put in an ‘ unexpected ’ appearance and showed guests the apartment ’s ceremonial four - poster bed			1
mrs @entity2 has previously spoken of how ‘ sexy ’ the flat feels			1
last night , @entity80 , chief executive of the @entity81 ’ @entity83 campaign group , said : ‘ it is good that the speaker uses his position to encourage the @entity88 tourist industry , but he and his wife need to be very careful not to put themselves in a position where the appearance is given that they are getting an advantage for helping this organisation			2
’ one @entity40 mp privately accused @entity95 - supporting @entity42 of profiting from her privileged position , saying : ‘ i ’m afraid this looks as though she ’s getting work on the back of events being held at her husband ’s official residence			2
’ mrs @entity2 hit back , saying there was ‘ nothing dodgy ’ about the offer of what she admits is a dream job			1
she said she had never attended an @entity32 event , and the offer came on the back of her @entity115 documentary with mr @entity15 , an @entity117 traveller			2
she added that it was ‘ nonsense ’ to bar her from getting work from organisations that have held events in the apartment where she lives with the speaker and their three children			1
she said : ‘ to say i ca n’t make a living or earn any income from completely independent approaches from organisations that happen to have been into @entity9 is ridiculous			0
’ lap of luxury : the five - star @entity50 , where mrs @entity2 will give her speech @entity133 , sea and sand : mrs @entity2 said she had to think about the @entity6 job offer for ' about five seconds ' before accepting the position mrs @entity2 said the engagement in @entity6 would be her debut on the lucrative international speaking circuit			1
in taking it , she is following in the footsteps of @entity144 ’s wife @entity143 , who addressed the conference three years ago			0
advance publicity for the £ 485 - a - head event in june says : ‘ @entity2 will give her take on being an independent woman balancing a career with family life whilst living in the goldfish bowl of @entity71			1
’ by coincidence , mrs @entity154 ’s book about life in @entity156 was called the @entity158			0
the @entity32 blurb describes mrs @entity2 as an ‘ outspoken member of the @entity95 ’ and adds : ‘ her experiences , media controversies and thoughts on @entity9 , politics and politicians making the news will be well worth a listen ! ’ mrs @entity2 was unclear what she was supposed to talk about , but asked if it would involve any tourism expertise , she said : ‘ oh god , no. ’ last night , @entity32 chairman @entity171 insisted there was no connection between the events held at @entity175 , which were charity fundraisers , and hiring mrs @entity2			1
a spokesman for mr @entity22 said he had ‘ no involvement with his wife ’s professional diary ’ , adding : ‘ around 100 events are allowed in @entity123 ’s @entity175 each year for educational , charitable or @entity179 purposes			0
the event in december 2011 was held to promote the @entity181 charity			2
neither mr speaker nor mrs @entity2 attended			1
‘ there is absolutely no connection between the event and the separate speaking invitation			0
