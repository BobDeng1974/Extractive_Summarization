when @entity6 from @entity7 , @entity8 , correctly guessed the price of a paddle board winning the @entity11 , she enthusiastically ran towards announcer @entity12 , arms outstretched			1
but the planned hug did not go smoothly when @entity15 tripped on a rug and was launched headlong into @entity12 's crotch			1
celebrity guest @entity42 watches in horror and then runs to the aid of @entity15 and @entity12 , who by this point have fallen backwards into a television , and ends up awkwardly hugging @entity15 's rear end			2
host @entity49 makes no attempt to disguise his mirth as he and the audience exploded in laughter at the humorous spectacle			1
@entity12 , red in the face but also laughing , is helped up by @entity57 who lays him down on the offending mat and pretends to do cpr			2
by this point , the script has entirely been thrown out the window and @entity49 can barely get the words out to tell the at - home viewers to stick around after the commercial break			1
for her part , @entity15 looks equally amused - as she would			0
she may have just tripped over in a truly slapstick fashion on national television , but she also won cameras , paddle boards , designer shoes , and two televisions			0
not over yet : @entity75 runs to help as @entity15 and @entity12 fall backwards into the televisions the model succeeds only in hugging @entity15 's backside awkwardly as @entity15 tries to help @entity12 up added bonus : @entity75 adds to the mood of frivolity by pretending to administer cpr on @entity12 host with the giggles : @entity49 is unable to contain himself and laughs all the way to the commercial break the good - humored barista posted the clip on her @entity87 today , with the caption , ' i 'm famous ! ! ! lol ! ! ! ! ' she said she had watched the clip six times and laughed each time			1
' everyone was more concerned about me than him			0
i felt so bad , i must 've apologized at least 10 times ! i got a nice rug burn on my knee so after i spun the wheel , they took me backstage , patched me up and had me sign a waiver , ' she wrote			0
' i 'd do it again in a heartbeat , tumble and all ! '			0
