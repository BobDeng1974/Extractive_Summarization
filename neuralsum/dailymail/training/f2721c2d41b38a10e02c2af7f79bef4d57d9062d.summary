by @entity0 published : 14:19 est , 28 february 2013 updated : 15:05 est , 28 february 2013 four government officials including attorney general @entity2 have spent more than $ 11 million of taxpayers ' money being ferried around in luxury jets that are supposed to be used for counter-terrorism operations , a new report has revealed			1
@entity2 , his predecessors @entity8 and @entity10 , and @entity12 director @entity11 went on nearly 700 ' non-mission ' trips between 2007 and 2011 - with one of the aircraft being used for executive travel a third more than for actual missions			1
the bulk of the flights - which cost an average of $ 16,285 - were taken on the @entity12 's two @entity23 jets , though the @entity24 and the @entity25 were also used for non-mission travel , according to a @entity28 report released on thursday			1
@entity29 : the bulk of the flights were taken on the @entity12 's expensive @entity23 jet , pictured , of which it has two the @entity29 costs just under $ 5,000 an hour to run , while the @entity24 costs around $ 3,700 an hour			2
nearly three - quarters of the flights were business related , for purposes like conferences , meetings and field office visits , while 24 per cent of travel was for personal reasons , most of which related to @entity2 's travel			0
the officials were required to use government aircraft for security and safety reasons , and in some cases reimbursed the government for a portion of the expenses , for example $ 420.80 for a 2010 trip to @entity52 that cost $ 15,894			0
sen. @entity53 , @entity54 , ranking member on the @entity55 , said given the hefty cost the officials should pass up the luxury @entity23 jets or reduce their air miles			2
travel : attorney general @entity2 , pictured left , and his predecessors regularly used the jets as did @entity12 director @entity11 , right , though less for personal travel ' these luxury jets were supposedly needed for counter-terrorism , but it turns out that they were used almost two - thirds of the time for jet - setting executive travel , ' he said			1
' nobody disputes that the attorney general and the fbi director should have access to the secure communications , but , for instance , there â€™s no reason they ca n't take a less expensive mode of transportation , or cut their personal travel			0
' the report says the jets are primarily there to accomplish and provide support for such things as transporting prisoners ; preventing illicit drug trafficking into and within the @entity91 ; and conducting a variety of counter-terrorism , intelligence , and criminal surveillance activities			1
the cost attributed to attorney general travel was $ 5.8 million while the @entity12 director 's travel was almost as expensive at $ 5.6 million			1
non-mission travel : travel by the attorney general composed 53 per cent of the flights , while the @entity104 's composed 42 per cent			2
around $ 1 million was spent ferrying other @entity106 executives around , including the @entity12 's deputy director aircraft : the $ 5,000 an hour @entity29 was used in 61 per cent of the officials ' trips @entity111 and the @entity104 's travel constituted 95 per cent - 659 out of 697 flights - of all non-mission flights			1
travel by the attorney general composed 53 per cent of the flights or 366 out of 697 , while the @entity104 's travel composed 42 per cent or 293			0
around $ 1 million was spent ferrying other @entity106 executives around , including the @entity12 's deputy director			0
@entity111 took 56 per cent or 206 out of 366 flights for business reasons and 41 per cent - 151 out of 366 - for personal reasons , while the @entity104 took 97 per cent - 284 out of 293 - for business reasons and 2 per cent or 7 flights for personal reasons			0
officials provided reimbursements of the applicable full coach fare for their personal travel , though this amount is generally a fraction of the cost of a flight on the @entity29 , the report said			0
the fbi director until 2011 was allowed to travel on commercial airlines for personal reasons and did regularly , while the attorney general is required to fly the government 's fleet for both business and personal travel			2
before many of the flights , the planes had to be flown from another location to @entity144 in @entity145 to pick up the officials and be flown back to their base once the trip was completed - something which added $ 1.5 million to the bill .			0

attorney general @entity2 , his predecessors @entity8 and @entity10 , and @entity12 director @entity11 went on nearly 700 ' non-mission ' trips over the period
the bulk of the flights were taken on the @entity12 's two @entity23 jets and cost on average $ 16,285
luxury jets were *bought* to be used for conducting a variety of counter-terrorism , intelligence , and criminal surveillance activities
