consultant cardiologist dr @entity0 was sacked after he blew the whistle on hospital conditions following a patient 's death a renowned heart specialist who raised the alarm over a hospital 's failings was unfairly dismissed in a calculated attempt to damage his reputation , a tribunal has ruled			1
consultant cardiologist dr @entity0 has won a two - year legal battle with @entity15 , which sacked him in september 2012 after he raised the alarm about staffing shortages , ' appalling ' equipment and workplace bullying			1
he voiced his concerns following the death of heart patient @entity22 , 63 , at @entity15 in june 2011			2
it was a routine angioplasty , an inquest heard in 2013 , but a senior nurse had been suspended hours earlier - without dr @entity0 's knowledge - and her absence contributed to the patient 's death			1
dr @entity0 , a renowned specialist who led the hospital 's well - regarded department for interventional heart procedures from 2007 , should have been afforded protected whistleblower status but instead lost his job in a case he claimed provided a damning demonstration of the trust 's attempts to cover up failings			1
the trust argued it dismissed him ' for making unsubstantiated and unproven allegations of an unsafe service ' , but the employment tribunal ruled there was ' no consistent evidence ' of gross misconduct and chief executive @entity48 , whose evidence it criticised as inconsistent , had ' failed to carry out a fair process '			0
between 2008 and his dismissal , dr @entity0 raised a catalogue of concerns about inadequate equipment , bullying and harassment of junior employees , removal of key staff , a lack of competent nurses and the failure to properly investigate serious incidents			1
in january 2010 he voiced serious fears to medical director @entity65 that the cardiology unit 's radiation equipment , then the oldest in use in the country , was putting patients and staff at risk			0
he was accused of fabricating his concerns so he could treat patients elsewhere , but six months later the machinery was condemned and replaced after breaking down during an operation			0
dr @entity0 voiced his concerns following the death of a heart patient at @entity15 ( pictured ) the friction came to a head in july the next year , when a 63 - year - old patient died during a routine procedure after a senior nurse was suspended without dr @entity0 's knowledge			1
dr @entity0 , who was left for 20 minutes without a nurse with even basic familiarity with the operation , described the suspension as ' the most overtly reckless act ' he had witnessed in his career			2
the trust claimed dr @entity0 's criticisms were ' vexatious ' and calculated to ensure @entity93 's restoration , and in september 2011 began disciplinary proceedings that culminated in his sacking			1
the tribunal found there was ' no evidence ' dr @entity0 had an ulterior motive and that ' extremely damaging ' and ' entirely false ' allegations were levelled at him during an investigation into mr @entity22 's death			1
those included claims by dr @entity105 , the hospital 's clinical lead for medical specialities that mr @entity0 was mentally unstable			1
employment judge @entity109 , who chaired the tribunal , added she believed a ' misleading ' press statement about mr @entity0 's dismissal , issued following the inquest 10 months later , had been ' calculated and was likely to cause damage to his reputation '			2
speaking after the tribunal 's ruling , dr @entity0 said : ' essentially they ignored some of the statements made to the serious untoward incident report and submitted their own version			1
' there 's no doubt in my mind that , if things have gone badly wrong , instead of saying things have gone badly wrong , they try to cover it up			0
' at the end of the day it is in order to misrepresent events to the patient and their relatives			0
' he added the legal battle and the trust 's decision to refer him to the @entity143 had taken ' a very considerable toll ' on him and left him unable to find work within the @entity147			1
he said : ' that 's why they do it			0
they do it because it will prevent me from getting a job and that will prevent me from pursuing them in court because i wo n't be able to afford the costs			0
' dr @entity0 said he believed the trust had spent ' more than Â£ 100,000 ' fighting his case , which he was only able to pursue because his lawyers @entity162 agreed to work pro bono			2
a spokesman for @entity15 said it would appeal the ruling			2
he added : ' we are clearly very disappointed with the tribunal 's decision			1
' we take all concerns about patient safety extremely seriously , as well as allegations of bullying against any of our employees			2
' it is everyone 's responsibility at @entity179 to uphold great care for patients , and for our staff to know that they will be listened to and supported			0
' @entity22 , 63 , was having a cardiac operation to widen obstructed arteries at @entity15 on june 9 , 2011 when it was discovered the specialist nurse would not be coming			0
an inquest held last year found complications developed as the operation proceeded , and mr @entity22 then suffered cardiac arrest and died			0
senior nurse @entity190 had been suspended moments earlier over claims she had harassed and bullied staff and failed to respond to written management requests			0
dr @entity0 told the inquest if he had known he would not have done the operation and he believed her suspension and management 's failure to tell him directly contributed to mr @entity22 's death			2
he also said the theatre ' descended into chaos ' as complications emerged			0
coroner dr @entity204 ruled sister @entity190 's absence had contributed to @entity22 's death .			0
