by @entity0 you might be fooled by tricks of the eye , but how about tricks of the ear ? while it ’s easy to mishear sounds when first heard , these auditory illusions are persistently misleading			1
for instance , the @entity12 tone , also known as a ‘ sonic barber 's pole ' , seems to continually rise or fall in pitch			1
scroll down for more audio clips ... @entity16 : the @entity17 it the audio version of the @entity21 optical illusion which depicts a ‘ continuous staircase ’ in which the stairs make four 90 - degree turns as they ascend or descend			1
the sound of the @entity12 tone is , in reality , a cycling between a limited set of tones , each separated by an octave , according to the @entity33			1
each tone in the scale is made up of several notes played simultaneously , and at each moment different notes in the tone are played at different volumes			1
the @entity40 is the audio version of the @entity42 which depicts a continuous staircase the trick involves not only which tones are played , but also the volume of the individual notes in the tones			2
changes in volume cause the listener to focus on certain notes while ignoring the others			0
the illusion works because each tone seems to sounds lower than the preceding			1
the listener judges subtle changes in tone by comparing it to the preceding note , not to tones from twenty or thirty seconds ago			2
a similar audio illusion , featured on @entity64 ’s @entity63 and discovered by @entity65 , reveals how the human brain tends to automatically group similar notes together			0
@entity16 : the scale illusion scale illusion from @entity71 on @entity72			2
the @entity12 tone seems to continually rise or fall in pitch			1
the sound of the @entity12 tone is , in reality , a cycling between a limited set of tones , each separated by an octave			1
the trick involves not only which tones are played , but also the volume of the individual notes in the tones			2
changes in volume cause the listener to focus on certain notes while ignoring the others			0
the illusion works because each tone seems to sounds lower than the preceding			1
the listener judges subtle changes in tone by comparing it to the preceding note , not to tones from twenty or thirty seconds ago			2
this audio must be listened through stereo headphones , or stereo separated loudspeakers			0
in the illusion two major scales are played with one ascending and the other descending			1
on its own , neither melody gives the impression of an ascending or descending pattern			2
but when the two melodies are played together most people hear this combination as being two scales that either ascend or descend in unison together			1
this is because the brain reassigns some of the notes to a different ear in order to make a coherent melody			0
people perceive these sounds differently , but the most commonly they group the high and low notes together			0
right - handed people tend to hear the high melody in the right ear , and the low one in the left , while left - handers have a varied response			0
@entity16 : the @entity134 illusion the @entity135 from @entity71 on @entity72			0
in @entity64 ’s blog , a number of other audio illusion are highlighted including the @entity134 illusion			0
this demonstrates how tone can determine the way in which we perceptually group notes in a melody			0
three notes , alternating in tone , are played slowly and most people hear a sequence that is rising in pitch			1
when this sequence is repeated faster , it ’s no longer possible to hear the trajectory of the melody change			0
' at a certain point we are forced to perceptually cut our losses — we begin to group the notes solely based on their timbre , ' said ms @entity160			0
the @entity134 illusion was discovered by @entity134 of @entity162 ’s @entity161 and @entity163 .			0

illusions include the @entity12 tone , also known as a ‘ sonic barber 's pole '
it sounds like a scale that seems to be rising or falling *forever* with no end
in reality it 's cycling between a limited set of tones , separated by an octave
in another illusion , two major melodies are played one after the other
when played together , the scales either ascend or descend , but on their own , neither melody gives this impression
