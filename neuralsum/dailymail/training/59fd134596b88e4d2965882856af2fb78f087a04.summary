@entity39 architect sir @entity179 's @entity178 is pictured the combined bascule ( drawbridge ) and suspension bridge that crosses the @entity183 was built between 1886 and 1894			2
the bridge is 800ftt ( 244m ) in length with two towers each 213ft ( 65m ) high , built on piers			2
the central span of 200ft ( 61m ) between the towers is split into two equal bascules , which can be raised to an angle of 86 degrees to allow river traffic to pass			0
the bridge consists of two towers tied together at the upper level by means of two horizontal walkways , designed to withstand the horizontal forces exerted by the suspended sections of the bridge on the landward sides of the towers			0
the bascule pivots and operating machinery are housed in the base of each tower			0
it was officially opened on 30 june 1894 by the @entity207 ( the future @entity208 ) , and his wife			0

five companies built the bridge , which cost £ 1,184,000 at the time , or £ 114million in today 's money			2
