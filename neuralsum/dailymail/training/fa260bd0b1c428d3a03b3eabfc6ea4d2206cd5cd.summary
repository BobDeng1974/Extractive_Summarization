an endangered killer whale who has spent almost her entire life performing in one of the smallest whale enclosures in the world may have only a few more hoops to jump through to earn her freedom			1
@entity9 's 44 years in captivity at the @entity11 could be over after officials at the @entity13 ( @entity13 ) placed her on the endangered species list with the wild orcas she was taken from decades ago			1
' captive animals such as @entity9 can not be assigned separate legal status from their wild counterparts , ' the agency announced wednesday , saying the change would take effect in 90 days			2
' whether or not she 's ultimately going to be released , or not , is an issue we 're not deciding today , ' said @entity41 , administrator of @entity42			0
the 20 - foot , 7,000 - pound whale has been the subject of campaigns from animal cruelty groups for decades , having been captured from the wild off the coast of @entity49 in 1970 , according to @entity50 ( @entity50 )			0
the @entity51 reports that year a group of whale hunters using speedboats and explosives herded dozens of orcas from @entity9 's pod into a 3 - acre enclosure in @entity59			2
@entity9 , who was originally called @entity9 , was bought for $ 20,000 and transported across the country to @entity11			1
@entity61 reported that @entity62 , a former show assistant at the @entity11 , recalled @entity9 refused to move or swim after first arriving in @entity11			1
cramped quarters : @entity9 has lived 44 years in an enclosure that activists say is 35 feet wide at its narrowest point wild creatures : orcas swim together in @entity70 off the coast of @entity72 squeezed tight : seen from above in this drone footage , @entity9 's pen is only 35 feet across at the area where a concrete divider separates parts of the pool ' she just barely floated , ' said @entity62 , who has also testified in favor of including @entity9 on the list of endangered orcas			1
' the skin on her back cracked and bled from the sun and wind exposure			0
she would nâ€™t eat the diet of frozen herring			0
' she eventually began sharing a tank with another orca , @entity90 , from the same killer whale resident community in @entity49 , with whom @entity9 mated but did not produce offspring			2
@entity90 had a horrifying tendency to bash his head against the walls and windows of the small tank , and died of an aneurysm in 1980 , leaving @entity9 completely along in the enclosure			0
that tank , a petition to @entity13 claims , is illegal because it is 35 feet wide at its narrowest due to a concrete divider that allows trainers an area to stand , though the aquarium claims it is 80 by 60 feet , ' she 's been there languishing in a bath tub for longer than all but one orca in captivity , ' said @entity114 , @entity50 's director of animal law			0
though a sale of the park last year to @entity119 - based @entity118 gave some hope for @entity9 to go free , so far nothing has changed about her captivity			0
the @entity11 has argued in the past that at this point , @entity9 would far better living at the park than in the wild			1
they cite the case of @entity129 , who played the killer whale in the 1993 movie ' @entity132 , ' who died in 2003 after being released off @entity134 , where he was rejected by wild pods			0
animal rights groups like @entity50 support a plan to slowly introduce @entity9 back into the water through an enclosure before releasing her to l pod , the group an 86 - year - old orca believed to be her mother still lives with , according to the @entity13 petition .			1

@entity9 who has spent most of her life at the @entity11 could be released under the @entity34
activists have petitioned the @entity13 to have @entity9 listed as endangered
