@entity23 @entity1 subsequently took a place on the bottom rung of @entity27 football and have since reached the second tier			0
this latest loan – after previous cash injections from @entity31 owner and @entity33 tycoon @entity32 - has been secured against the £ 800,000 fee received from the transfer this month of 20 - year - old @entity38 international midfielder @entity37 to @entity39			1

but separate moves recently by the @entity52 consortium led by @entity53 and by former @entity1 director @entity54 to make share purchases in the club mean the @entity43 tycoon is unlikely to succeed in his takeover – at least as originally planned			1
