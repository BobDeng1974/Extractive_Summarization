by @entity0 using the internet can help elderly people combat depression , according to a new report			1
it 's estimated that as many as 10 million older americans suffer from depression , often brought on by feelings of loneliness and isolation			1
but the latest research - a project that followed the lives of thousands of retired @entity6 for six years - found that internet use among the elderly can reduce the chance of becoming depressed by more than 30 per cent			1
using the internet can help elderly people avoid depression , new research suggests ‘ that 's a very strong effect , ’ said @entity21 , a @entity22 professor of telecommunication , information studies and media who led the project			2
‘ and it all has to do with older persons being able to communicate , to stay in contact with their social networks , and just not feel lonely			2
’ professor @entity21 and her colleagues analysed the data collected by the @entity33 , which collected information from more than 22,000 older @entity6 every two years			1
this particular sample included more than 3,000 respondents			0
‘ this is one of the largest and most comprehensive surveys of its kind , ’ professor @entity21 said			0
other smaller studies have been inconclusive about the role internet use , and technology in general , play in helping people overcome depression			2
one way in which this study was different is it took into consideration the participants ’ depression levels before they began using the internet			1
the researchers wanted to know if past depression affected current depression			0
what they found is yes , some people did remain depressed despite internet use , although it was n't substantial			1
using the internet can help elderly people stay in touch with friends and family meaning they feel less lonely ‘ internet use continues to reduce depression , even when controlling for that prior depressive state , ’ professor @entity21 said			2
the researchers also confirmed what was found in other studies : that for older people who live alone , internet use had a greater impact on their levels of depression			1
‘ this study makes significant contributions to the study of internet use and depression in the older , retired population , ’ professor @entity21 said			1
she said it all comes down to how you choose to use your technology			0
as with most things in life , moderation is best			0
‘ if you sit in front of a computer all day , ignoring the roles you have in life and the things you need to accomplish as part of your daily life , then it 's going to have a negative impact on you , ’ professor @entity21 said			0
‘ but if you 're using it in moderation and you 're doing things that enhance your life , then the impacts are likely to be positive in terms of health and well - being			0
’ this research is published in the journal of gerontology : psychological sciences and @entity108 .			0
