the a-listers on the @entity2 red carpet were the epitome of glamour and sophistication , with most of the stars looking elegant in their floor - length gowns			1
however , the after - parties were a different affair altogether , with celebrities - some of whom who were not invited to the awards ceremony itself - trying their best to grab the limelight in revealing dresses and no underwear			1
@entity18 flashed her bottom in her see - through black gown at the @entity23 @entity2 bash , while model @entity24 gave the singer a run for her money as the most daringly dressed in a gown that exposed half her body with only a few black panels to protect her modesty			1
she wore a sparkling @entity59 gown that exposed her ribs and side boob as well as her hips and legs , forcing her to forgo wearing any underwear for the evening			2
model @entity65 also opted for a slinky cut - away style floor - length gown , complete with thigh - high split as she attended the @entity23 party			2
model and mother - of - four @entity55 , 41 , could n't wear underwear with this sparkling @entity49 gown at @entity72 's @entity2 after party model and tv personality @entity65 was another who wore a revealing black dress with no underwear to the @entity23 party @entity78 were definitely not an outfit staple for the evening as many of the stars ditched theirs to show off their bare backs or reveal a plunging cleavage			1
some of the actresses who had attended the ceremony - such as @entity85 and @entity86 - changed into different outfits for the after parties which were more revealing			2
birdman actress @entity85 ditched her @entity90 gown for a white suit that flashed her cleavage while best supporting actress nominee @entity93 swapped her custom - made @entity95 gown for a less flattering maroon dress that also revealed her decolletage			0
@entity98 , left , and @entity99 , right , were spotted at the @entity23 @entity2 party in @entity101 on sunday @entity102 white open back maxi dress buy it at @entity105 visit site @entity107 looked breathtaking at sunday 's night 's post @entity109 party as she shunngled up next to @entity98 - and it was her simple white dress accessoried with stunning diamonds ( the size of that necklace ! ) that caught everyone 's attention			1
it 's by @entity102 and we love the padded shoulders and dramatic puddle train			0
whilst a white maxi dress might seem a bit too bridal , the key is to keep it simple like this one			0
add a chunky choker and numerous cocktail rings a @entity107 and you wo n't be in danger of anyone thinking you 're about to walk down the aisle ! click the link ( right ) to buy @entity107 's dress at @entity105			0
but if you do n't fancy flashing quite so much cash , then check out our edit below			0
@entity138 / @entity138 is all over the trend , or the back of this short @entity142 dress is very reminiscent of the real deal			0
@entity144 visit site @entity146 with @entity147 and @entity148 visit site @entity150 lined @entity144 at @entity151 visit site @entity153 with @entity154 and cut out back at @entity155 visit site @entity98 wore a cleavage - exposing dress to the @entity2 ceremony and then changed into this revealing gown at the @entity23 party			1
the sheer nude dress meant she wore neither bra or knickers for the evening speaking of the trend for revealing outfits at the after - parties stylist @entity167 told @entity168 : ' once the formal ceremony is over it 's ok for the celebrities to let their hair down and get into their revealing after - show - stopping outfits			1
' @entity18 , @entity24 and @entity65 all seemed in competition to see who could wear as little of their black dresses as possible			2
@entity24 shows us all why she is a top lingerie model with an intricate outfit of black tights with what seems to be a dress attached			0
no underwear modelling needed here			0
' @entity18 shows off her stunningly fit derriere in her sheer dress , and @entity65 wears a cut - out dress with swirls which leaves no place ( or need in her case ) for @entity192 or any other body hugging under garments			0
' these girls are daring , brave and want the world to know they are outgoing , risk taking ladies – there 's nowhere better to get a guaranteed picture in the press than the @entity2 after - party and with a green ticket to be as outrageous as they like			2
