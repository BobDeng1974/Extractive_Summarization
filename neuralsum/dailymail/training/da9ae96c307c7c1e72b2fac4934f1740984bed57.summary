a 12 - year - old boy will be one of the first patients in the @entity2 to undergo an experimental epilepsy treatment using drugs derived from cannabis			1
the trial comes after a series of @entity9 - led studies found cannabidiol ( @entity11 ) could reduce the frequency and severity of seizures in children with acute epilepsy			1
patients will receive the medication , @entity19 , which is chemically based on @entity11 , a compound found in marijuana that is not psychoactive , therefore does not give a ' high '			1
now , the study is to be extended into the @entity2 , and patients are being selected for a randomised and controlled trial of the treatment			1
it will run in hospitals in @entity27 , @entity28 , @entity29 and @entity30			0
@entity33 , 12 , who suffers from severe epilepsy will be one of the first patients in the @entity2 to trial the experimental drug @entity19 , which is based on @entity11 ( @entity11 ) , a compound found in marijuana the initial focus will be on children with @entity40 , a rare but serious type of epilepsy that is difficult to treat			1
some children will receive the treatment while others will receive a placebo			2
@entity40 usually develops before the age of one and causes prolonged seizures lasting more than five minutes			0
it has a significant impact on the child 's development and can be fatal			0
researchers will also study the effect on children with @entity56 , a type of childhood epilepsy that is difficult to treat			2
this syndrome normally develops when children are aged between one and six and is characterised by frequent seizures of different types			0
only children whose seizures can not be controlled with existing medications will be invited to take part in the new trial , researchers said			2
@entity33 , 12 , from @entity69 , @entity70 , who suffers from severe epilepsy will be one of the first patients in the @entity2 to trial the cannabis - sourced medication			1
his mother , @entity76 , 41 , said : ' @entity33 was a five - month - old baby when he was diagnosed with @entity77			1
' he used to be happy and noisy , but he had his first @entity78 just after his fifth birthday , and about four or five years ago he was diagnosed with @entity56			0
' sometimes i just think he suffers but he ca n't tell us as he ca n't talk at all			0
he 's in his own little world now and we do n't get much interaction from him now			0
the new trial will focus on @entity40 , a rare and catastrophic form of epilepsy that begins in infancy			2
children with @entity87 tend to have normal development as babies but development starts to plateau when they are in their second year of life			0
individuals with @entity94 syndrome face a higher incidence of sudden unexplained death in epilepsy patients ( @entity98 )			2
they often also experience other conditions including developmental delays , sleeping difficulties , chronic infections and difficulty feeding			0
there is currently no cure and treatment options are limited - they mainly involve using anti-epilepsy drugs to treat the seizures			1
@entity110 is known about the long term prognosis of people with @entity94 syndrome			0
' last year we heard on @entity114 about the little girl in @entity116 who stopped having seizures after she was put on @entity11 , and as soon as we heard we mentioned it to the hospital			1
' around that time we met with our doctor ( dr @entity120 ) and he knew that we were very keen on it			0
' i got in contact with the company who produce the drug and they said that if we got the go - ahead from the hospital then we could go ahead			2
' @entity19 is being developed by @entity19 , a @entity2 biotechnology company which is also sponsoring and funding the trial			1
mrs @entity76 said : ' there was a lot of red tape as there 's been no trial in the @entity2 yet , so they are concerned about safety , but we 're almost there			1
' we do n't have the time to wait for clinical trials as to how it will affect people			0
' i do n't know if it will make a difference but we really just want to try it as i 've lost count of how many medications he 's tried over the years			0
' the early data from the @entity9 is giving us a lot of hope which we 've not had for a long time			0
' we believe it 's going to be started in march or april and will run for about 12 weeks although we 've not been told exactly what it is yet			2
we think it 's a liquid chemical from the plant			0
' dr @entity120 , of the @entity159 's @entity158 , one of the hospitals where the trial will take place , said : ' many children with serious forms of epilepsy do not respond to the medications that we currently have available			2
' we need new means of treating these conditions so that we can give back some quality of life to these children and their families			2
' @entity174 , founder of the paediatric epilepsy charity the @entity176 , added : ' i welcome the launch of these trials as it marks an important milestone in our long journey towards understanding the condition and improving the treatment of those suffering this severe form of epilepsy			1
cannabis - derived drugs such as @entity188 are already used in the @entity9 , @entity2 and other @entity190 countries to treat the pain associated with multiple sclerosis and cancer			1
pictured , is a cannabis plant ' as the mother of a teenager with this life - altering condition , i strongly support the exploration of ground breaking medications that could seek out new ways to improve patients ' life quality			0
' i am excited to see organisations from across the @entity2 work together on the development of this treatment and look forward to the trials ' results			1
' professor @entity209 , of @entity210 , added : ' severe epilepsy can have an incredibly debilitating effect on individuals			0
' these trials will allow us to accurately test the viability of treatment with @entity11 in a safe and controlled way			1
' the trials will take place at the @entity159 's @entity158 , the @entity221 in @entity28 , @entity222 in @entity29 and @entity30 's @entity210			0
cannabis - derived drugs such as @entity188 are already used in the @entity9 , @entity2 and other @entity190 countries to treat the pain associated with multiple sclerosis and cancer			1
two other cannabis - derived drugs , @entity230 and @entity231 , are also used in @entity232 and the @entity9 to treat the nausea and vomiting associated with chemotherapy and @entity236 - related anorexia .			1

@entity33 , 12 , has epilepsy which current drugs have not controlled
he will be the first patient in the @entity2 to undergo treatment with @entity19
this is an experimental drug derived from @entity244 ( @entity11 ) marijuana
@entity11 is a compound found in cannabis that does not give a ' high '
