by @entity0 published : 15:58 est , 29 january 2014 updated : 15:58 est , 29 january 2014 a ' weather map ' for a distant world where it rains molten iron has been produced by scientists			1
the brown dwarf @entity8 - technically a ' failed star ' - is 6.5 light years away and the closest object of its type to the sun. using novel techniques to analyse its atmosphere , scientists found that @entity8 is surrounded by a searingly hot blanket of patchy clouds made up of droplets of liquid iron and other minerals			1
a composite image of a map of the weather on the surface of @entity8 , the nearest brown dwarf to @entity27 , shown at six equally spaced times as it rotates once on its axis , and where it rains molten iron the clouds have a complex structure and temperatures exceeding 1000 ° @entity35 as the object rotates , bright and dark clouds move in and out of view and alter its brightness			1
using two telescopes in @entity42 , the researchers mapped a layer of the clouds and reconstructed what happens at different levels of the atmosphere			0
it is hoped the findings published in @entity50 will lead to similar observations on giant planets in distant star systems			1
the weather outlook on @entity8 is bleak			1

the learn more about the weather , researchers used a technique called doppler imaging which makes use of the fact light from a star is slightly shifted in frequency as it rotates			1
from these a rough map of the stellar surface was reconstructed			0
dr @entity88 , of the @entity89 in @entity90 , said : ' previous observations have inferred brown dwarfs have mottled surfaces but now we can start to directly map them			2
' what we see is presumably patchy cloud cover - somewhat like we see on @entity98			0
' the maps correspond to very rough versions of satellite weather maps of our own planet			1
dr @entity88 said : ' in future we will be able to watch cloud patterns form , evolve and dissipate - eventually maybe exo - meteorologists will be able to predict whether a visit to @entity8 can expect clear or cloudy skies			2
' in a second study dr @entity110 , formerly at @entity111 and now at @entity112 , reconstructed what happens in different layers of the atmosphere on the brown dwarfs			2
' we ’ve learned the weather patterns are quite complex			2
the cloud structure varies quite strongly as a function of atmospheric depth and can not be explained with a single layer of clouds , ' she said			0
' the exciting bit is this is only the start			0
with the next generations of telescopes and in particular the 39 m @entity128 we will likely see surface maps of more distant brown dwarfs - and eventually a surface map for a young giant planet			1

with the next generations of telescopes and in particular the 39 m @entity128 ( pictured ) we will likely see surface maps of more distant brown dwarfs - and eventually a surface map for a young giant planet , ' said dr @entity110 from @entity112 evidence of extraterrestrial clouds covering two of the most common types of planets in our galaxy have been discovered by the @entity155 telescope earlier this month			1
the atmospheres were discovered by two separate teams of scientists who were analysing the climate of planets @entity161 and @entity163			2
the researchers claim their work is an important milestone in characterising potentially habitable , @entity27 - like worlds beyond the solar system			0
@entity161 is categorised as a ' warm @entity169 ' because it is much closer to its star than frigid @entity169 is to our sun. the planet is located 36 light - years away in the constellation @entity177			1
gj 1214b , meanwhile , is known as a ' super-earth ' type planet			0
super-earths have masses between that of @entity27 and @entity169			0
' both planets are telling us something about the diversity of planet types that occur outside of our own solar system ; in this case we are discovering we may not know them as well as we thought , ' said @entity193 of the @entity194			2
the planets can be observed passing in front of , or transiting , their parent stars			0
this provides an opportunity to study these planets in more detail as starlight filters through their atmospheres .			0

scientists looked at brown dwarf @entity8 which is 6.5 light years away
they analysed environment using doppler imaging which makes use of the fact light from a star is slightly shifted in frequency as it rotates
findings could lead to weather maps of planets in distant star systems
