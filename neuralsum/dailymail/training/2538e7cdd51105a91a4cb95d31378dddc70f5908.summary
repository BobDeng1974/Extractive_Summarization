by @entity0 published : 05:00 est , 16 october 2013 updated : 07:33 est , 16 october 2013 a farmer who found oil bubbling up onto his land is not about to reap a windfall from the shock discovery - because the crude comes not from an undiscovered deposit , but from a burst pipeline			1
@entity9 owns the farm in @entity11 which last month became the site of the largest oil spill ever to take place on land in the @entity16 he now fears his land will not be fertile for years to come , and could claim thousands of dollars in compensation from the company whose pipeline runs beneath the farm near the remote town of @entity23			1
record : 20,000 barrels of crude oil have spilled from a pipeline running through @entity11 damage : the spill is set to make the farmland unusable for two or three years , according to mr @entity9 mr @entity9 's discovery has been compared to @entity31 , the classic sitcom in which farmer @entity31 strikes it rich by finding oil on his land			1
however , rather than profiting mr @entity9 is set to lose out , as he quickly realised that the crude oil he could see was in fact from a pipeline which runs from the @entity39 rock formation to a nearby freight railway hub			1
he found the oil on september 29 when he was harvesting wheat and saw black liquid standing six inches deep in his fields			1
the oil came from a ' perfectly round , quarter - inch hole ' producing ' about 100 pounds pressure ' , mr @entity9 told @entity48			1
discovery : the spill was found by farmer @entity9 as he was harvesting wheat on his land near @entity23 work : vehicles cleaning up the damage from the spill on mr @entity9 's farm it soon emerged that the pipe , owned by @entity59 , had spewed out a total of 20,600 barrels of oil , apparently the biggest spill on land in @entity16 history			1
the spill covered an area of land the size of seven football fields , and produced enough oil to fill three @entity72 - sized swimming pools			2
mr @entity9 says it has ruined much of his land , affecting his livelihood for several years , and he will not be able to sell grain for human consumption if it has been grown within half a mile of the spill			2
' i 'm not going to be able to farm that land for a few years and there 'll be compensation for sure , ' he said			0
' that is going to come later			0
we 're looking at a two - to three - year cleanup			0
' it took two weeks for state officials to tell the public about the spill , prompting environmentalists to speak out about alleged close links between the state and oil companies which are vital to its economy			0
operation : a vacuum truck sucking up oil from the ground around where the pipeline sprung a leak compensation : mr @entity9 says the company responsible for the spill should make up for his losses ' as long as we let oil companies keep us locked into these forms of extreme fossil fuels , we 'll continue to see spills like these , ' @entity110 's @entity109 told @entity48			2
mr @entity9 said that the amount of oil released into the soil would be ' pretty detrimental to any living organism that 's in the ground '			0
the pipeline has been shut down by @entity59 while the oil is cleaned from the surrounding area , with the spill expected to cost the firm nearly $ 2million			0
however , experts this week questioned the company 's estimate of how much oil leaked from the pipelines , saying it was ' at best a guess '			0
an engineer who helped measure the amount of oil spilt in the @entity132 by the broken @entity133 well @entity128 said that the estimate by @entity59 did not appear to be backed up by any scientific studies .			0

@entity9 found oil on his @entity139 farm while harvesting wheat
crude came bubbling from pipeline with a ' quarter - inch hole ' in it
@entity147 can not grow crops on his land for two or three years after spill
