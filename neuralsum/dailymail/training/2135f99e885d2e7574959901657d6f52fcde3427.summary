it was the feature that made him instantly recognisable , and in @entity2 ridiculed			0
@entity4 's toothbrush moustache was as much his hallmark as a swastika and his side - parting hair style			1
now the story of how the dictator went from having an elaborate handlebar moustache to the style he is forever associated with has been told in @entity13 - nominated series @entity14			1
before and after : a new series reveals that @entity4 got his infamous toothbrush moustache ( right ) after he had to trim his handlebar style ( left ) to allow his gas mask to properly seal during the @entity19 the three - part mini series from the @entity21 sheds a new light on the conflicts that defined the 20th century , and features dramatic re-enactments as well as interviews with historians and current political figures including @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity30 and @entity31			1
the series , spread over six hours , starts with a @entity19 soldier discovering that his handlebar moustache , complete with twisted ends , is preventing his gas mask from sealing tightly during a gas attack in a trench			1
the soldier , revealed to be a young @entity4 , is then shown trimming the facial hair into a neat square , creating the infamous style			1
@entity42 , the series ' executive producer , said his research team had learned how @entity4 had favoured a longer moustache prior to the outbreak of the @entity19 while making the programme			1
' we 're trying to be as factual as we can , ' he told the wrap			0
preference : @entity4 , pictured as a young soldier , had favoured a longer moustache prior to the outbreak of the @entity19 ' sometimes we have to compress time			1
he was n't ordered to shave the mustache , but actually he shaved the mustache while he was in the hospital			0
budget-wise , it would have been tough to film there as well as in the trench			0
' after the conflict ended in 1918 , @entity4 kept the moustache , still preferring the trimmed style as he rose to power in @entity64 in the early 1930s , and it soon became one of his most identifiable features			2
mr @entity42 said : ' i think in actuality after @entity19 that was a fashion , and a lot of people did that			2
between @entity19 and @entity73 , that was a fashion that a lot of people had			2
and being that @entity4 had it , he kind of killed that fashion			0
' proof ? @entity4 's preference for a longer moustache is evidence that this photograph appearing to show him cheering the outbreak of war in 1914 was faked @entity4 's preference for a longer moustache at the outbreak of the @entity19 was recently used by historians to suggest that a famous photograph of him apparently celebrating @entity64 's declaration of war on august 2 , 1914 in @entity90 was a fake			1
the picture , which first appeared in the pages of the @entity96 propaganda publication @entity97 on march 12 , 1932 , the year @entity4 ran for president , appeared to show a 25 - year - old @entity4 cheering , and he later claimed it was at that moment that he found his purpose in life			0
it was captioned : ‘ @entity4 , the @entity64 patriot , is seen in the middle of the crowd			0
he stands with blazing eyes – @entity4			0
’ however , it has been claimed the photograph was faked by @entity4 and his personal photographer @entity108 , as the original negative of the picture was never found , and he can not be seen in newsreel footage of the event			0
ridicule : @entity4 's moustache was one of his most identifiable , but also his most ridiculed features - as demonstrated by comedian @entity116 in @entity117 satire : @entity119 was another adopter of the toothbrush moustache , and used this similarity to @entity4 to his advantage when parodying him in 1940 film @entity125 ( pictured ) mr @entity42 said he had initially struggled to find an actor to play @entity4 in the series , which has been emmy - nominated for @entity128 , @entity129 , and @entity130 or @entity131			1
he then cast actor @entity132 as the young @entity133 , and @entity137 , who had a small role in another @entity21 series @entity134 , as the older version of the dictator			2
he said : ' the hardest part to find was @entity4			0
we did a lot of casting , i remember our casting notice was picked up online at one point and a lot of sites were saying , “ it 's finally good to look like @entity4 ! ” ' although popular between the wars , when it was sported by comedians @entity119 and @entity152 , the toothbrush moustache fell out of favour after the @entity73 due to its strong association with @entity4 .			2
