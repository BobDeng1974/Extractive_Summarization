scent off : @entity0 with one of his fragrances			1
@entity3 has said its 28 per cent revenue drop is partly down to the poor performance of the singer 's scents from the @entity10 to reality tv star @entity11 , it seems that most public figures have them			0
but the allure of the celebrity scent seems to be waning with beauty giant @entity3 seeing a 28 per cent revenue drop because of a decline in their sales			2
furthermore , the company said the slump , which triggered a 25 per cent fall in share price , was largely due to the fragrances of pop stars @entity0 and @entity24			1
the cosmetic firm said its quarterly pre-tax loss to the end of june was £ 48m – the worst in the company ’s 104 year history			1
wild child @entity0 , who last week pleaded guilty to charges of careless driving and resisting arrest , had launched three perfumes by his 20th birthday in march this year			1
his most recent scent , @entity35 ( following on from someday launched in 2011 and girlfriend in 2012 ) is a ‘ fruity floral ’ mix of pink jasmine and sweet osmanthus blossom , which promises to ‘ channel @entity0 ’s authentic voice that inspires his millions of dedicated fans to believe – to believe in themselves , to believe in their connection with @entity0 , and most of all , to believe that their dreams will come true			1
’ however , with the singer ’s delinquent behaviour and increasing brushes with the law - last month he pleaded no contest to a vandalism charge in @entity57 - it would appear his popularity , in terms of perfume at least , could be falling			0
meanwhile 24 - year - old @entity61 and its follow - on @entity62 , is also creating big losses for @entity3 despite being on sale the @entity66 for just £ 13.50			1
the @entity68 singer says her products capture ‘ the moment when you instantly feel a connection to someone , but then there ’s that feeling of being completely enamoured — enchanted — when you know a little more about that someone and still feel that strong connection			0
’ this will hopefully be achieved thanks to a ‘ charming and sparkling surprise of vibrant fruits , kissed by a bouquet of soft petals and a touch of sweet indulgence			0
’ each year , more than 500 celebrity perfumes are released into an already highly saturated market , which began with the launch of @entity91 ’s @entity90 for @entity3 in 1991 and went on to sell 60million bottles			2
sales were at the highest in 2011 , when @entity0 ’s someday was the biggest selling perfume in @entity68 – with one bottle sold every minute in the first week of its launch			0
the company , which is having to cut 175 jobs because of the slump , said on tuesday that half the loss was due to such products , adding in a statement : ‘ the decline in sales of celebrity fragrances , particularly the @entity0 and @entity24 fragrances , was steeper than anticipated			1
’ other celebrities with their own perfumes include former x-factor judge @entity119 , @entity120 and @entity121 , @entity122 , @entity123 and one direction			0
most of the cast of @entity127 is @entity128 also have their own brands , including @entity11 ’s @entity130 and @entity131 ’ @entity132			0
in 2012 , it emerged that @entity10 @entity134 has commissioned celebrity @entity137 perfume maker @entity135 , who created scents for @entity140 and @entity122 , to create his own personal cologne			0
around of 75 % of @entity3 ’s sales come from perfumes , compared to its rival @entity146 which relies more on cosmetics .			2
