the @entity1 parents who rejected heroic @entity4 @entity3 star @entity2 as a new born baby have emerged to salute her achievements			1
until a few days ago they had no idea that the 20 - year - old record - breaking swimmer was the disabled child they gave up to an orphanage as teenage parents			1
her biological @entity13 family had even watched her on tv at the 2012 paralympics without knowing who she was			1
@entity3 hero : swimmer @entity2 holds up one of the five gold medal she won at the @entity21 event @entity2 pictured taking her first swimming lesson as a young child ' i got scared ' : @entity2 's biological @entity25 was a teenager when she gave birth @entity2 was adopted aged one by @entity4 couple @entity27 and @entity28 from an orphanage in @entity30 , some 2,350 miles east of @entity31 , and she grew up in @entity32 , @entity33			1
born without fibulas , ankles , heels , and most of bones in her feet , @entity2 's lower legs were amputated when she was just 18 months old and she soon learned to walk with prostheses			1
her adoptive parents showered her with love and enabled her to reach remarkable heights , she has become one of the @entity4 ' most inspirational sportswomen having won a dozen gold medals in three paralympics			1
after her latest clutch of golds in @entity51 , @entity13 journalists tracked down the @entity1 parents @entity52 and @entity54 of @entity2 , who on friday was one of the @entity56 and @entity3 stars hosted at a @entity58 reception by president @entity59			1
deeply emotional , @entity61 , now 38 , @entity2 's real mother , stumbled as she tried to find the words to explain on @entity13 television how she felt two decades ago , at the age of 18 , after giving birth to a seriously disabled daughter , reported @entity67			1
' i feel so sorry , ' she said			2
' at that time - there was some fear , i got scared			1
i had to leave her behind			2
but i did think that i would take her back			2
' of course i was against leaving her in the hospital but because of the circumstances we had to do so			2
in my heart i did want to take her home , and thought i would take her back later			1
' she stressed : ' i was alone in @entity1 , without my mother and father			1
where would i go with her , if i had taken her ? doctors told me to leave her behind - said that i could not help her ... i called her @entity25 , after my elder sister			2
' proud father : @entity2 's biological father @entity82 @entity2 , then called @entity25 , in a @entity1 orphanage family resemblance : @entity2 ( left ) and her biological mother her then boyfriend - now her husband - said the couple felt pressurized by doctors to make the decision to give her up			1
he was only 17 when she was born , and the couple - who have since had three more children including another disabled daughter , @entity93 , 13 , born with a similar condition to @entity2 , who they care for at their village home			1
' what could i have said ? i could n't say anything because i was not ready for this			2
i was very shocked with the whole thing , ' he says now			0
' i do n't want to say anything bad about the doctors			0
they said : " the girl has deformities and you are young , it 's going to be hard "			0
' he recalls that ' of course ' he and @entity61 wanted to take little @entity25 ( now @entity2 ) home , but seemed to find recalling this moment too painful to find words to explain it fully			2
he did , though , express his deep pride over @entity2 's life and achievements in @entity4 , and very much wishes to meet a daughter he only even saw for a few minutes in the maternity hospital			1
' of course i 'm happy that we found her , glad for her and i am proud			0
and of course i want to meet her , ' he said			0

i was getting information about my daughter , that she was growing up pretty , that everybody loves her			2
' and then i got information that she was being adopted to @entity4			1
