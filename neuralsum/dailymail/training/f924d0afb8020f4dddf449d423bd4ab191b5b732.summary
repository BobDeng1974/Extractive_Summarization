when @entity1 boasted that her body was ‘ completely natural ’ , two things immediately stood out			1
one was that she seemed to be fibbing			1
and the other was her apparently miraculously expanding chest			1
now the former @entity5 has admitted that she did have cosmetic surgery to enlarge her breasts			1
speaking about it for the first time , she added that she then changed her mind and had the procedure reversed			1
at the time she insisted her inflated look was down to support tape inside her clothes and push - up bras			1
she even said : ‘ i ’m completely natural , except for my fingernails , and i have a bit of help with my hair and a bit of a @entity31 [ fake tan ] going on			1
’ but her lawyers admitted in 2005 that she ‘ had in fact undergone breast enhancement surgery ’			1
now mrs @entity1 , 39 , who had her fourth child , daughter @entity37 , in 2011 , has spoken about her fake boobs			1
‘ i do n’t have them any more , ’ she told the @entity40 magazine @entity39			1
‘ i think i may have purchased them			2
’ according to her biographer @entity43 , the initial enhancement surgery nearly 15 years ago set her back £ 10,000			2
although she has never before publicly admitted to artificially increasing her bust size , she has confessed to cringeing at photos showing her inflated chest			2
surgery : according to her biographer @entity43 , the initial enhancement nearly 15 years ago set her back £ 10,000 reduction : her lawyers admitted that she had undergone breast enhancement surgery in 2005 , but claims she does not have them anymore she once told an interviewer : ‘ i ’ve worn so many dresses in the past and when i see the photographs i think , crikey , my boobs are up round my neck again			2
’ she also cryptically told the @entity62 edition of @entity63 in 2011 : ‘ no torpedo bazookas			2
’ she declined to elaborate at the time			2
in next month ’s issue of @entity39 , the fashion designer also talks about her beauty secrets			0
she says she does n’t shave her legs but instead has laser hair removal on the advice of her friend @entity72 , the @entity73 actress			0
you can go back for little touch - ups if you do see little hairs appearing , ’ mrs @entity1 says			1
‘ but i ’ve been very lucky that i have n’t had to			0
that was one of the best tips that @entity72 ever gave me			0
’ in the interview she is also full of praise for her footballer husband @entity82 , 38			0
‘ [ @entity83 ] is the most wonderful man i have ever met , ’ she says			0
‘ he ’s a fantastic father			0
he ’s incredibly talented , a wonderful husband			0
i supported him for many years , and he ’s proud of me			0
we ’re very equal at home			0
’ she sounds nostalgic for the time the family spent living in @entity88 after her husband ’s career took them there , telling the magazine : ‘ @entity94 for six years was the happiest i think i ’ve ever been			0
it was much more accepting for a woman to have a career , as well as a man			0
’ but mrs @entity1 , who moved back to @entity62 with her family last year , is quick to add : ‘ i ’m not saying i ’m not happy now			1
i ’m just as happy now ! ’ the designer , who tells @entity39 that she gets up at 6am every day and runs four miles a day , is likely to be flying back to @entity40 frequently as she goes about establishing a base for her eponymous womenswear label in @entity104 .			0

mrs @entity1 reportedly went to a clinic to go from a @entity107 to a @entity17
visited a *specialist* in @entity15 after the birth of first son , @entity20 , in 1999
