@entity1 ’s sense of injustice over @entity4 ’s red card on saturday has been heightened by their private view that defender @entity6 was the victim of a headbutt by @entity8 forward @entity9			1
@entity1 manager @entity10 made the slightly peculiar claim on saturday night that @entity4 ’s foul of @entity13 in the second half of his team ’s 2 - 1 win at @entity17 was no worse than some tackles committed by their opponents			1
however it was an alleged incident between @entity6 and @entity9 that infuriated @entity1 as the teenage full - back left the stadium sporting a huge shiner beneath his left eye			1
@entity6 was allegedly involved in an incident with @entity9 ( left ) that left him with a black eye @entity4 ( centre ) is given his marching orders during @entity1 's 2 - 1 defeat of @entity8 the @entity1 captain was sent off for a rash challenge on @entity13 ( @entity33 ) @entity1 would not comment publicly on the matter but at one stage in the second - half @entity6 was seen remonstrating with a linesman who he clearly felt should have picked up the incident			1
on sunday night , the @entity39 had no record of a complaint and will wait to see if there is anything in the report of referee @entity45 when it drops on monday morning			0
@entity6 was also critical of the decision to send off @entity4 and claimed his tackle was no worse than a trip on him by @entity9 earlier in the game			2
' we have actually had a lot of bad luck , especially with @entity4 ’s red card as i would say there was a handball before that but the referee did n’t stop play , ' said @entity6			0
' earlier in the game , @entity9 did the same to me			0
' but i just focus on winning games and i ’ll keep doing that			0
