the @entity0 is often heralded as the talent factory when it comes to @entity4 football			0
@entity5 , @entity6 and @entity7 all made their debuts in the competition , as many youngsters are given an opportunity to strut their stuff with the first team			0
so , as another round approaches , which young guns should you be watching out for at your club ? @entity18 ( @entity19 , vs @entity20 ) age : 18 nationality : @entity23 ( @entity24 20 , under 19 ) a name which is probably familiar to most @entity19 fans , though @entity18 has yet to be given a true chance to shine in the first team			1
a tall , quick and powerful striker , the 18 - year - old has a fine scoring record with the youth ranks in @entity33 and impressed on the right wing in the competition against @entity36 last season			2
his mix of raw power and a much improved eye for goal has delighted @entity42 , who says he is a ' huge talent '			0
@entity18 has been described as a ' huge talent ' by @entity42 and could be a star of the future @entity47 ( @entity48 , vs @entity49 ) age : 17 nationality : @entity23 ( under 18 ) labelled as a ' potential young @entity52 ' by @entity53 , the pressure has been on young @entity47 since he was 15			1
the cultured midfielder seems to have dealt with it well , though , furthering his education with the youth team and seems to be the perfect mould for @entity60			0
@entity61 is out , so the time might be now for @entity47 to partner @entity52 in the centre			2
@entity47 was labelled as a young @entity52 at the age of 15 @entity66 ( @entity65 , vs @entity67 ) age : 18 nationality : @entity23 ( @entity24 19 ) despite being a lifelong @entity71 supporter @entity66 has really kicked on at @entity65			2
along with @entity72 ( son of @entity74 ) , has scored bags of goal for the @entity77 under @entity78			0
will possibly be competing with @entity79 for a place in the squad with @entity82 the only fit senior striker at the club , and could get the nod due to his speed and clinical edge up front			2
@entity66 could step up for @entity65 in the absence of @entity90 and @entity82 @entity91 ( @entity92 , vs @entity93 ) age : 19 nationality : @entity23 ( @entity24 20 , under 19 ) a mainstay last season as @entity92 won the @entity98 , @entity91 shone with his dynamism in midfield and his box - to - box running			1
made his senior debut against @entity103 earlier this year , and will hope for another opportunity against @entity67			0
@entity91 shone in a @entity92 youth team that won the @entity98 last season @entity107 ( @entity19 , vs @entity20 ) age : 19 nationality : @entity23 ( @entity24 20 , under 19 ) another @entity110 who featured in the match against @entity36 , @entity107 is a versatile who is another imposing figure in the youth team			1
@entity107 is the captain of the under 21 team , primarily at centre back , but his only experience under @entity42 has come at the heart of midfield			0
given the defensive casualties at @entity19 at the moment though , he is expected start in his favoured position against @entity20			1
the @entity125 boss admitted @entity107 is ' now ready for that level '			0
@entity107 , pictured up against @entity128 in training , is @entity19 's @entity24 captain @entity131 ( @entity19 , vs @entity20 ) age : 21 nationality : @entity134 more of an unearthed diamond , @entity135 has followed a similar route as @entity138 in progressing to a possible debut			1
signed from @entity141 after a successful trial last year , the 21 - year - old slotted straight into the second string and could be on the bench or even start depending on @entity146 ' selection			0
@entity135 was signed from @entity141 last season and could feature , with @entity19 's defensive crisis @entity149 ( @entity48 , vs @entity49 ) age : 17 nationality : @entity23 ( under 18 ) shot to fame with two goals against @entity154 in the @entity155 earlier this month , and could be an option for @entity60 on the wing against @entity49			1
blessed with blistering pace and @entity160 - like dribbling , @entity48 beat the likes of @entity92 to sign the 14 - year - old for Â£ 2million from @entity163 in 2011			1
@entity164 has impressed this season for @entity48 's youth teams and is set for stardom @entity168 ( @entity20 , vs @entity19 ) age : 19 nationality : @entity23 ( @entity24 20 ) if you thought @entity20 's line of production was over after their summer departures , think again			1
following on from @entity175 , @entity168 is a left - back who has been involved in the first team set - up this season , albeit on the bench			1
tipped to shine this season by @entity182 , the 19 - year - old could step in for @entity184 on tuesday night			2
@entity20 's @entity168 could be the next @entity175 at left back @entity185 ( @entity186 , vs @entity187 ) age : 20 nationality : @entity23 ( @entity24 21 ) the highly - rated versatile defender penned a new three - year contract at @entity186 in the summer , and could make his bow against @entity187			1
able to carry the ball out of defence and a strong physical presence , @entity185 impressed in the @entity196 on loan at @entity198 last season			2
@entity185 ( left ) is another fine @entity186 youth product and impressed on loan with @entity198 last season @entity202 ( @entity203 , vs @entity204 ) age : 19 nationality : @entity23 an immensely talented individual following on from @entity208 and @entity209 , @entity210 hit a hat - trick for the development side earlier this month			0
got a taste of senior football on loan at @entity217 last season , and may be given the chance to shine by @entity219			0

@entity19 face @entity20 and @entity18 could feature up front
@entity47 and @entity164 are stars of the future for @entity48
@entity168 could be the next @entity175 for @entity20
@entity91 was superb as @entity92 won the @entity98 last season
