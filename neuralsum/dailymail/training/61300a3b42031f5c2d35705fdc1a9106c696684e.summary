a small village in @entity1 is fighting to keep the name of their local pub and its original signage which shows a black boy being scrubbed in the bath by a white couple			1
yarnsfield locals have battled for 20 years to keep the sign in the 166 - year - old @entity12 pub , after it was first removed in 1994 after two 10 - year - old girls complained			1
it was then replaced by a farmer sowing seeds			0
in 2001 , then - licensees @entity16 and @entity17 found the sign and hung it in the beer garden , prompting the @entity20 and @entity21 to request it be removed from view			1
the sign was given less prominence , but remained on display in the garden			1
a small village in @entity1 is fighting to keep the name of their local pub - @entity30 - and its original signage which shows a black boy being scrubbed in the bath by a white couple the original sign , featuring a white couple engaged trying to scrub a black boy white , was removed in 1994 after two young girls complained that it was racist ; it was then subject to a council letter in 2001 asking for it to be removed from view , before being displayed again in 2009 in 2009 @entity43 and @entity44 took over the pub and again there was talk that the ' sign should come down '			1
but at the time mr @entity43 was reported as saying the locals told him , ' do n't even touch it , we 've been though so much to keep it			2
' pub regular @entity53 was said to have then arranged a referendum of villagers to find out if they wanted to keep it			2
they were reportedly overwhelmingly in favour of doing so			0
the pub is presently closed undergoing renovations , and the owner , @entity65 brewery , has said it is now considering changing the name , but wo n't say what they might change it to			1
the future of the controversial sign also remains unclear			2
a @entity65 spokeswoman said ' no decision ' has been made about whether it will remain as part of the pubs ' fixtures and decorations			2
it is understood that @entity65 may rename the pub the @entity80			2
pub regular @entity81 , 56 , said : ' if it goes ahead , which we 're sure it will , it will be political correctness gone mad			1
in 2009 @entity43 and @entity44 , pictured , took over the pub and again there was talk that the ' sign should come down ' , but the licencees were told to keep it up as the locals had fought so hard to keep it ' we are too upset about offending people these days , even if it means sacrificing our pub heritage			1
there is not one person who uses this pub that thinks the name or the sign is racist			1
' it should stay as it is because the pub is an integral part of the village 's history			0
' local @entity108 , 80 , said he fears the pub and village will lose its identity and its heritage if the name is changed			0
he added : ' it has been called the @entity30 for more than 100 years			0
' they only want to change the name to attract interest and deceive people into thinking it 's a new pub. ' i hope the people in the village boycott a new name , i really do			0
' the original sign was replaced with this one , showing a field being attacked by gulls immediately after being ploughed ; the pub 's new owner , @entity65 , is now considering changing its name and it is not known if the original sign will remain at the premises @entity132 , who runs @entity133 , has set up a petition that has so far gained 300 signatures			1
the 47 - year - old said : ' there is strong opposition against it			0
it has been the @entity12 for 166 years			1
' @entity141 , who sits on @entity142 , added : ' in the past there a little bit of aggravation on the name and the sign because it is not seen as politically correct and caused a race row			0
' i can understand why the people in the village want to retain the name as it is part of our heritage			0
' but mr @entity141 said he also understood why @entity65 might want to change the pub 's name			0
' in the 25 years i have lived here the pub has closed a couple of times and the tenants do n't seem to survive very long			2
' it has to be a positive that @entity65 wants to invest the pub and village because at the moment it 's not particularly attractive			0
' a spokesman for @entity166 said : ' we are currently reviewing several options for this popular village pub with the aim of having it back open and trading at the heart of the @entity80 community as soon as possible			0

the @entity12 pub has been serving @entity1 locals for 166 years
in 1994 complaints from two young girls led to its signage being removed
the council sought its removal in 2001 after it was displayed outside
the sign was put up again in 2009 and has remained at the pub ever since
the pub is currently being renovated and its owner may remove the sign
*enterprise* is also considering changing the pubs name when it *reopens*
yarnsfield locals are petitioning against it saying its *pc* ' gone mad '
