by @entity0 outgoing representative @entity1 joined the flurry of former @entity4 presidential candidates tossing their name into the ring for 2016 on tuesday			1
@entity1 told @entity7 that the media has been wrong not to include her in 2016 speculation thus far because she may give the presidency another go			1
' the only thing that the media has speculated on is that it ’s going to be various men that are running , ' she said after the poling website asked her if woman would enter the horse race			0
' they have n’t speculated , for instance , that i ’m going to run			0
' what if i decide to run ? and there ’s a chance i could run , ' she said			0
if @entity1 did run again , she would be one of several 2012 presidential candidates seeking a do - over and one of as many as a dozen republicans vying for her party 's nomination			1
party like its 2012 : rep. @entity1 , pictured here at the @entity34 's @entity33 in june , says there 's a ' chance ' she 'll run for president again in 2016			1
if she does , she 'll likely be one of several former candidates in the @entity4 primary @entity40 claims he 's not running again , but anything can happen in politics @entity43 said this weekend he 's ' preparing for the possibility of a presidential run ' @entity46 said tuesday he 's ' definitely considering ' another run @entity49 governor @entity43 and former @entity50 senator @entity46 have both indicated that they are considering future campaigns , too			1
at a book signing in @entity53 , @entity50 , last night , @entity46 said he was ' definitely considering ' another campaign will make a decision ' sometime next year			1
' in the meantime , the 2012 candidate , said he 's not ' doing anything inconsistent with running for president			1
' @entity46 , whose been saying for the last year that he 's ' open ' to another presidential campaign , reportedly chalked up his busy travel schedule to the promotion of his book , @entity64 , which was released at the end of april			1
@entity50 news website @entity66 said @entity46 also cited the book tour as his excuse for a visit to all - important presidential primary state @entity71 in two weeks - his second in the last eight months			2
@entity43 has also made the mecca to @entity71 recently , attending a church service and a local @entity4 gathering there over the weekend			2
while there , he admitted to the @entity78 that he 's eying another presidential run			2
' i try not to be perceived as being coy , ' he said			0
' i am preparing for the possibility of a presidential run			2
' ' yes , i think about it , and i know how to be prepared for it , ' @entity43 said , noting that he 's learned from the mistakes of the past			2
' the biggest error in judgment i made [ in 2011 ] was thinking that just because i ’d been the governor in the state of @entity49 i was prepared to run for the presidency of the @entity91 , ' @entity43 told the post			1
' it is very different in the sense of having a global grasp of what ’s going on in the world			0
' another name making a comeback in politics is @entity40			0
@entity40 , the 2012 @entity4 nominee , has said he does not plan to run again , but he could yet change his mind			2
@entity40 adamantly claimed in 2008 he would n't subject himself to another presidential campaign and ran again anyway			0
a recent poll of voters in first - in - the - nation state @entity105 found that @entity40 would blow his potential competitors out of the water if he did seek an encore			0
@entity1 was not included in that poll , having just signaled this week that she 's debating another run , but @entity43 and @entity46 were , and both men barely registered on the poll , garnering one and two percent of the vote , respectively , in the hypothetical match - up			1
@entity40 emerged as the dominant force in @entity105 @entity4 politics last week , blowing away the competition in a hypothetical 2016 presidential primary matchup none of the former 2012 candidates looking for a second chance - or third , if @entity40 really does explore another campaign - have anything to lose			1
neither @entity40 nor @entity46 currently hold elected offices , and @entity126 is not running for another term in @entity128			0
after january , she 'll be free to join @entity46 and @entity43 on the unofficial campaign trail in early primary states			1
likewise , @entity43 has opted not to run for a fourth full term as governor of @entity49 , having already held the office for more than a decade			2
even if none of the other 2012 contenders ran again , @entity1 would likely face a tough , and crowded , field of fellow candidates			1
@entity139 governor @entity138 , former @entity141 governor @entity140 , @entity143 governor @entity142 , @entity145 chairman and 2012 vice presidential nominee @entity146 of @entity143 are all said to be considering campaigns			0
that 's in addition to @entity151 governor @entity150 , retired neurosurgeon @entity152 and sens. @entity153 of @entity141 , @entity154 of @entity49 and @entity155 of @entity156			0
@entity1 told @entity7 that if she did try again , her previous experience as a presidential candidate would ' certainly ' be to her advantage			1
' i have n’t made a decision one way or another if i ’m going to run again , but i think the organization is probably the key , ' she said			2
' to have an organization and people who surround you who are loyal , who are highly competent , who know how to be able to run the ball down the field in state after state -- because now i think the primary process will be very different this time			0
it will tighten up ; it will be a much shorter run than it was before			0
' recent elections do show that @entity4 candidates who have prior experience as a presidential candidate do have a better chance at winning the nomination the second time around , and @entity1 was an early favorite in @entity71 last time			1
@entity185 sen. @entity184 was selected as @entity4 ' 2008 nominee after losing out the first time to @entity49 governor @entity188			0
former @entity189 governor @entity40 won the 2012 nomination getting beat out for the honor in 2012 by @entity184			0
if tradition holds true , the @entity4 nominee will be @entity1 , @entity43 or @entity46 , assuming any or all of them run			1
' like with anything else , practice makes perfect , ' @entity1 said			0
' and i think if a person has gone through the process -- for instance , i had gone through 15 presidential debates -- it ’s easy to see a person ’s improvement going through that			0
