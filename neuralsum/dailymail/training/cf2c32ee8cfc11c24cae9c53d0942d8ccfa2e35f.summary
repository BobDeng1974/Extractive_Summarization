by @entity0 published : 06:46 est , 23 january 2013 updated : 20:36 est , 23 january 2013 at the helm of his 16ft catamaran , @entity1 has been riding the waves for almost a decade – to the utter frustration of his local sailing community			1
now he has well and truly earned the nickname captain @entity8 after the @entity9 was called out to rescue him for the 15th time			1
mr @entity1 , described as a ‘ bloody menace ’ by one harbour master , is believed to have run up costs of almost £ 40,000 for the charity after repeatedly flipping his boat while pursuing his hobby – or ‘ pushing the boundaries of sailing ’ , as he puts it			1
mr @entity1 ’s latest episode happened near his home town of @entity33 , @entity24 , on monday , when he decided to set sail in some of the worst weather of the winter			1
he became stuck floating 100 yards from the beach after winds dropped but the @entity9 were soon at the scene offering to tow him to shore			2
after refusing their help but failing to get moving again , mr @entity1 capsized the £ 1,500 catamaran and hauled it back to the beach			1
@entity56 's worst sailor ? mr @entity1 declined assistance and insisted he would sail his vessel back to shore himself oops : but after flipping his catamaran , the hapless sailor was forced to push his vessel back to @entity63 beach @entity64 , @entity65 ’s maritime manager , said : ‘ obviously he ’s got this captain @entity8 nickname for a reason – it ’s richly deserved			1
the @entity9 are all volunteers , they all have better stuff to do with their time , but they will respond to it because that ’s what they do			2
‘ i would urge people to sail within the limits of their competence			0
’ mr @entity1 , a 56 - year - old father of one , began sailing in 2003 and was forced to dial 999 three times that year			1
in 2007 he was rescued four times in four hours after he flipped his boat , and three years later he wrecked his old boat – aptly called ‘ mischief ’ – trying to ride @entity24 ’s giant @entity83 wave			2
stubborn : the rescue crew had found ' captain calamity ' clinging to his catamaran off @entity33 's @entity63 beach getting into mischief : the @entity9 has had to come to mr @entity1 's aid on numerous occasions in the past but he has no plans to hang up his wetsuit			1
explaining his latest error , the retired electrician said : ‘ it would have been much easier for me to grab a rope but it ’s my little adventure and i feel it has to involve an element of risk			0
‘ the problem the @entity9 have is that if some granny walking along the cliffs calls them saying i ’m in danger , they have to act on it			2
they ’re not thrilled about it and neither am i. ‘ my boat has been in mortal danger many times but that ’s replaceable			0
i ’m not in danger			0
‘ i know what i do is a little bit different but it ’s my way of being in tune with nature			0
if you ai n’t got adventure in your life , you ai n’t got nothing			0
’ an @entity9 spokesman said they would continue to respond to all mayday calls			0
video : watch hilarious footage of captain @entity8 's latest maritime adventure			0

sailor @entity1 has been nicknamed ' captain calamity ' for repeatedly getting himself into *scrapes* at *sea*
the 56 - year - old refused assistance from a lifeboat crew when he flipped his catamaran for the fifteenth time off the coast of @entity24
every call out costs the @entity9 £ 2,500
