a deadly tropical sea snail uses a super-potent form of insulin to subdue its fish prey , scientists have discovered			1
the geographic cone snail ( conus geographus ) uses the chemical to cause a plunge in blood sugar , leaving the fish sluggish and unable to swim to safety			1
in this way the snail is able to entrap whole schools of small fish			1

it hunts in two ways , both by releasing toxins into the water and by firing a harpoon - like poison - tipped tooth into its @entity27 antidote exists for a cone snail sting , which contains a mixture of nerve agents			2
the new research has uncovered one highly unusual ingredient in the cone snail 's venom cocktail - weaponised insulin			2
in tests , a synthetic version of the hormone - made from shorter protein chains than normal insulin - lowered the blood sugar levels of adult zebrafish			0
injected into water , it also reduced the movements of fish larvae			2
@entity47 scientist professor @entity46 , from the @entity48 , said : ' this is a unique type of insulin			0
it is shorter than any insulin that has been described in any animal			0
' we found it in the venom in large amounts			0
' the insulin forms part of a poison mixture evocatively known as ' nirvana cabal '			0
adding the hormone to its armoury of toxins allows the snail to disable entire schools of swimming fish by sending them into hypoglycaemic shock - a condition brought on by plummeting blood sugar levels			1
the type of insulin , while stripped down , matches that found in fish , the scientists learned			2
a second cone snail species that practised fish - netting , @entity76 , was also found to have insulin in its venom			1
other species that only operate as ambush hunters did not possess the insulin toxin , and nor did others that prey on molluscs or worms			0
writing in the journal @entity87 , the researchers concluded : ' evolving insulin to be used as a pharmacological weapon presents a novel and unexpected type of event in chemical biology			0
there are about 30 recorded instances of people being killed by cone snails , some of which have attractive and collectible shells			1
' our study reveals a class of insulins that have evolved to act rapidly and potently to cause severe hypoglycaemia			0
' the snail insulin could prove to be a useful tool for probing systems the human body uses to control blood sugar and energy metabolism , they said			2
there are about 30 recorded instances of people being killed by cone snails , some of which have attractive and collectible shells			1
the molluscs are aggressive if provoked and their poison - loaded harpoons can penetrate wetsuits			0
while the sting of small cone snails is no worse than that of a bee , larger species can produce a serious and potentially fatal reaction .			0
