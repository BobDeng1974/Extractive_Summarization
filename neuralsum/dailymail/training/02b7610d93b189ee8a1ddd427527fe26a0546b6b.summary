by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 00:46 est , 21 august 2012 updated : 05:36 est , 21 august 2012 a film producer on a flight bound for @entity4 has given a blow - by - blow account of how an unruly passenger forced the plane to make an unscheduled landing in @entity9			1
@entity10 took to @entity11 to reveal the ordeal suffered by passengers on @entity14 when a man , identified only as an ex-marine called @entity17 from @entity18 , @entity19 , began behaving in an aggressive and erratic manner			1
drinking heavily and swallowing pills , the veteran abused passengers with threatening language , stumbled around the plane and sexually assaulted a pregnant woman , it is claimed			1
the trouble began when the @entity29 filmmaker boarded the @entity31 flight in @entity19 on sunday evening and found a man wearing a hooded top sitting in his window seat			1
there was someone sitting already in my seat			1
' a youngish looking guy maybe late 20s ( turned out he was 32 ) quite burly white crew cut lots of tattoos			1
' hey that 's my seat man i said			1
a quick drawling f * * * you its mine now was the response i sat down next to him mumbling " charming "			1
' fodder for his next script : mr @entity10 , a @entity29 movie producer , posted 60 tweets on the prolonged incident after landing in @entity4 mr @entity10 , who has worked on films including @entity73 , @entity74 and @entity75 , said that @entity17 's bizarre behaviour rapidly escalated over the next three hours			1
at one point he tore up a magazine , licked the pieces and stuck them to a television monitor in front of his seat			2
he also stumbled up and down the plane and is said to have groped a pregnant woman			1
describing one walk around , mr @entity10 said : ' this time he walks to the front			2
i feel uneasy and i go back & tell one of the ladies that he 's acting weird			2
' and i 'm really not sure that it 's a good idea that he 's hanging around the front where all the buttons are for the doors			2
' @entity17 's verbal abuse and intoxicated demeanour eventually became so threatening that an off - duty air marshal was forced to sit next to him and the flight was diverted to @entity97			1
the air marshal and @entity17 exchanged words , until , as @entity10 tweeted : ' hoodie tries to get up but air marshal blocks him			2
more f * * * yous			2
' hoodie throws his vodka at him but it lands on the couple in front of him			2
' it was then that mr @entity10 , who had moved his seat earlier in the flight to get away from @entity17 , volunteered to again sit next to the ex-marine , telling him , ' let 's talk let 's just talk			1
' he tweeted : ' i sit			2
the smell of alcohol is incredible			2

' at this point , @entity10 tells @entity17 that he is a movie producer , to which the @entity168 says he is going to @entity4 to work on a commercial			1
' listen man i want u to read my stuff , it 's a movie , ' @entity17 reportedly told mr @entity10			0

' urgent detour : the red - eye flight from @entity19 to @entity179 was diverted at about 1am yesterday as the plane lands , @entity17 repeatedly implored mr @entity10 : ' do n't forget me			1

do n't forget me ' and hands the producer a folded piece of paper , which mr @entity10 initially believes is his email address			1
moments later , police board the plane and escort @entity17 off in handcuffs			1
mr @entity10 tweets : ' we eventually take off again			1
i replay the whole thing in my mind again as the adrenaline wears off			0
