by @entity0 @entity1 was once on the brink of stardom			1
a former disco - dancing champion , the @entity6 actor and singer was a star of @entity10 musicals such as @entity11 and @entity12 and had landed a modelling contract in @entity14			0
better : @entity1 says he hopes to hit the big time once more after recovering from his illness he appeared on stage with @entity18 and mixed with a-listers like @entity20 and @entity21			1
but just as @entity1 was about to hit the big time and be offered a part in a new group that was being put together - pop band sensation steps - it all ended			1
the once - superfit star , used to jumping around on a stage for hours every night , could barely move			0
he felt lethargic , had no energy and could barely drag himself out of the house			0
worse still for someone in a profession which relies on looks as well as talent and personality , his hair began to fall out in huge clumps			1
well - meaning friends put it down to stress over the loss of his mother who had recently died , but @entity1 knew it was more than that			2
in the meantime , @entity1 was desperate to restore his failing locks and went to a clinic for a hair transplant			1
' i was so worried about my health and what was happening to my hair , ' recalls @entity1 , now 47			1
' but it left me with terrible scars			0
it affected my confidence and my career and my hair still kept coming out			0
' the surgeon who carried out the operation was later struck off for carrying out liposuction surgery without proper qualifications , but @entity1 is philosophical			2
' i did n't complain as i 'm not that type of person , but i do believe in karma , and what goes around comes around , ' he says			0
' i just do n't think the man knew what he was doing			0
' highlight : @entity1 's @entity10 career was going from strength to strength when he was diagnosed friend : @entity1 counted @entity18 among his a-list friends during his theatrical heyday he had to turn down the chance to sign up to steps and was unable to work any more due to his weakness			1
he was further hit by tragedy , as his father passed away and then his brother , former @entity82 heavyweight boxing champion @entity81 , died at the age of just 41			0
it took five years for @entity1 to be finally diagnosed with @entity85 , or chronic fatigue syndrome			1
now living in @entity87 , @entity6 , @entity1 is taking medication for his condition which has made a great difference to his health			1
he has also had a second , successful hair transplant from his hair clinic in @entity94 and is ready to hit the big time again			2
' i was doing so well when i fell ill , but now i 'm determined to rekindle what i had , ' says @entity1			2
' when it was all going downhill , i was as low as i could possibly be			0
i did feel like not going on , to be honest - people with chronic fatigue syndrome have committed suicide			1
but i 've had an inner strength and believe that good things do come out of the bad times			0
' i would n't be the person i am today without the things that have happening to me , and now i just want to get on with my life			0
' the seventh son of a seventh son , @entity1 believes the words of a fortune teller once visited by a family friend , who told her that someone close to her called @entity112 would be successful and famous , but not until later on in his life			2
' hopefully that is what is going to happen , ' says @entity1 optimistically			2
currently single , @entity1 spends his time concentrating on his song - writing and contacting his old friends in the industry to let them know that he is ready for his comeback			1
' it 's a big step for me , but now i just want to get on with my life			0

@entity1 mixed with stars like @entity18 and @entity20
considered for @entity125 but chronic fatigue syndrome made his hair fall out
now planning his comeback after looks restored after a second transplant
