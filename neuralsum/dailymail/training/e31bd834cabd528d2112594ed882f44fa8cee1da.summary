stopping and smelling the roses is now a matter of simply waiting at a bus stop , thanks to an idea which sees gardens planted on top of public transport vehicles			2
a prototype range of the adapted buses are aiming to purify air in cities that have a lack of urban green areas			2
landscape artist @entity15 's system , dubbed @entity16 , uses condensation from the vehicle 's air conditioning system to water the roof			1
the garden can also be manually watered			0
fresh air : in years gone by smokers used to frequent the top deck , but now the roof is being used for an altogether cleaner purpose lung trans - plant : designer @entity28 argues cities need to grow with the general population in order to provide them with a clean and healthy environment attraction : the first prototype is already in use and has been transporting tourists across the city of @entity39 his first bus is currently being used to transport tourists to and from a nature and camping facility in @entity39 , @entity45			1
last week he completed the first van in the world with a @entity16 roof			1
mr @entity15 said : ' urban green areas are crucial for photosynthesis , a process in which plants absorb @entity54 and release @entity56 - vital for purifying the air we breathe			1
' the lungs of a city must grow at the same rate as its population , but much - needed green areas are not always available			0
' @entity64 has grown out of this supposition , with the goal of delivering a practical and tangible solution			0
groundbreaking : designer and inventor of the @entity16 , @entity15 , at work ' if finding new urban spaces for gardens is problematic , we can use spaces that already exist , such as the roofs of city public transport			2
' our mission is to expand the garden area in urban areas , increase the absorption of @entity54 and give public transport a new ecological and tourist attraction			1
' the system uses lightweight 7cm - thick hydroponic foam , which retains humidity but not water , and helps to reduce the weight in periods of continuous rain			0
small shrubs can then planted to suit the climate of the host city or to match a particular bus lines own identifying garden			2
to water the roof , it is only necessary to make use of the condensation of the air - conditioning units installed on the roof of the vehicle			0
the hotter it gets , and the more water the plants need , the more they are watered , by the simple act of using the air - conditioning			0
the bus 's innovator added : ' it really started last summer , when i made the first prototype on a bus in a small town near @entity113			1
' it stills working now and , thanks to its @entity16 vegetable roof , temperature inside have decreased @entity118			2
' since then , i 've spent several months working in introducing improvements , and making it legal			0
' now , i am so proud this is a reality and has passed all technical and security controls			0
' mr @entity28 is now in discussion with an auto company interested in sponsoring a fleet in @entity113			1
his garden van will be one of the main attractions in @entity129 at the @entity130 in september			0
all aboard : the first garden bus in @entity45 has been specially designed to improve the quality of the air in the country 's urban centres plant out : mr @entity28 puts the finishing touches to the garden he has been planting , ready for it to be installed on top of a bus @entity142 man : mr @entity15 has also completed his first commercial van and is hoping this idea will take off too			1

a new *eco-friendly* bus has hit @entity45 *streets* designed to clean the air up
dubbed @entity16 , the bus is already dropping *passengers* off in @entity39
the aim is the garden bus will absorb *harmful* @entity54 and @entity56 *emissions*
the innovator is talking with a bus company to *kit* out a fleet in @entity113
