when footballers surrender the habit of doing even the basics right , you know a team is in trouble			0
by that rationale , @entity6 and manager @entity7 would appear to be in very deep trouble indeed			1
this was not a performance to place alongside the capitulation at @entity13 just over a fortnight ago			0
it may be a while before we see the like of that again			0
at times last night @entity6 kept the ball and spent time in @entity21 ’s half			1
they created half - chances			2
right at the death , they could even have equalised			0
how @entity26 lifted the ball on to the crossbar from only six yards perhaps even he does n’t know			2
@entity21 striker @entity29 rises above the @entity6 defence to direct a header into the net @entity29 celebrates his early strike against @entity6 on monday night @entity21 : ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : @entity34 6 ; @entity35 6 , @entity36 6.5 , @entity37 6.5 , @entity38 7 ; @entity39 6 , @entity40 6.5 ; @entity41 5.5 ( @entity42 23mins 6.5 ) , @entity43 6.5 ( @entity44 60mins 6 ) , moses 6.5 ( @entity45 81mins 5.5 ) ; @entity29 6.5 goals : @entity29 16 booked : @entity35 @entity6 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : @entity47 6 ; @entity48 4.5 , @entity49 5 , @entity50 5 , @entity51 6 ; @entity26 6 , @entity52 5.5 ; @entity53 5 , @entity54 5 ( @entity55 74mins 6 ) , @entity56 5 ( @entity57 67mins 6 ) ; @entity58 5 ( @entity59 45mins 6 )			1
booked : @entity26 referee : @entity60 6.5 @entity61 : @entity62 one of the big giveaways when you watch bad teams , though , is how easily they concede possession and what they do when they do n’t have the ball			1
on both those scores , @entity6 were utterly wretched again last night			2
@entity29 ’s winning goal in the first half was a fine header			1
it happened because @entity6 made weak challenges and showed a lack of commitment in the air			0
subsequently , @entity21 capitalised on careless @entity6 passing to break regularly on @entity47 ’s goal			1
at times forward @entity62 must have felt he was participating in some kind of training drill			0
speaking on the @entity87 , pundit @entity86 summed it up beautifully			0
‘ every time @entity6 have a set piece , you feel that @entity21 are going to break away and score , ’ said @entity86			2
had @entity21 been more ruthless they would have buried @entity6 , but the fall - out is the same — the visitors stay joint bottom and poor @entity7 slips closer to the unemployment line			1
how much longer the @entity6 manager ’s misery will go on , only owner @entity96 can be aware			1
what is beyond doubt is that @entity7 ’s travails are painful to watch			0
his employer seems not to care for him , his players have forgotten how to play for him and his club ’s supporters — or at least a huge portion of them — have had enough of him			0
last night , this result had an air of inevitably about it			0
so bad had @entity6 been at @entity13 that nobody blinked when @entity29 headed @entity21 into the lead after quarter of an hour			1
@entity6 fans vent their anger at the club 's owner @entity96 during monday 's game at @entity21 @entity6 fans hold up placards calling for manager @entity7 to be sacked @entity6 supporters display a banner calling for the removal of manager @entity7 @entity6 fans hold up a banner portraying @entity7 as @entity124 with the word hopeless underneath @entity6 had actually been marginally the better team until then			1
in an instant , though , @entity21 broke to score and the tone of the game was set			0
it was a fine goal from @entity21 ’s point of view			2
the cross from the left by the lively @entity62 was a good one and @entity29 ’s leap was impressive as he headed the ball past @entity47 from ten yards			1
from a @entity6 point of view , though , there was culpability everywhere			0
right back @entity48 had two opportunities to tackle moses before the cross arrived but was simply too weak or perhaps lacking in zeal			0
fans young and old called for the head of @entity7 during defeat at @entity21 on monday night @entity6 manager @entity7 acknowledges the travelling fans after the final whistle @entity6 owner @entity96 was at the @entity149 to watch side lose to @entity21 @entity96 had told a reporter that he would sack @entity7 if @entity6 lost at @entity21 but later claimed the jibe was a ' tongue in cheek ' @entity155 miles @entity21 111.0 69.0 @entity29 90 12.1 7.5 @entity156 90 11.7 7.3 @entity39 90 10.8 6.7 @entity6 116.9 72.6 @entity26 90 12.8 8.0 @entity48 90 11.9 7.4 @entity157 90 11.2 6.9 when @entity62 did deliver , @entity6 captain @entity50 utterly failed to compete in the air with @entity29			1
the @entity21 player was able to rise a good six inches above his marker and that made scoring the goal much simpler			2
it was a dreadful moment for @entity6 and one wondered how bad it would get from that point			0
indeed , had referee @entity60 spotted @entity56 ’s foul on @entity62 in the penalty area soon after , the contest may have been over by the time the first - half rain had stopped			1
@entity7 ’s team lacks discipline and suffers from lapses in concentration			0
it is a deadly combination and almost undid them on two or three more occasions before the interval			0
had @entity21 made some better decisions of their own they would have profited but the closest they came was when @entity29 applied a poor touch to a @entity62 pass and shot wide			1
substitute @entity42 then drove a low effort against @entity6 defender @entity157			0
at the other end , @entity21 goalkeeper @entity34 saved low from @entity48 as half time approached but the other side of the interval brought little change in the overall pattern			2
@entity42 was unfortunate to see a right - foot shot cannon off the far post in the 48th minute while @entity62 should have done better than allow @entity47 to block when two @entity6 defenders fell over each other to gift him a chance on the hour			1
@entity21 ’s profligacy subsequently kept @entity6 in the game and @entity26 could have snatched something when @entity57 ’s cross reached him at the death			1
all he could manage , though , was to snatch at the chance and it was typical of @entity6 ’s night			2
as he left the field , @entity7 applauded the @entity6 fans			2
they did not respond in kind			0
@entity62 ' heat map shows how he was threat wide on the left - click here for more heat maps and stats in matchzone @entity56 of @entity6 battles for the ball with @entity29 of @entity21 @entity21 midfielder @entity43 goes down under the challenge of @entity52 @entity6 defender @entity157 heads the ball under pressure from @entity42 of @entity21			1

pressure on @entity6 manager @entity7 *cranked* up after his side were beaten at @entity149
ahead of the match @entity219 owner @entity96 - who the club insist was *joking* with the comment - said @entity7 would be ' finished ' if it ended in defeat
@entity29 headed in the winner from a cross by the lively @entity62 in the 15th minute
@entity21 should have been awarded a penalty in the first half when @entity56 *bundled* over @entity62
@entity26 missed great chance to grab later equaliser when the ball dropped to him right in front of goal , but he could only fire it against the bar
