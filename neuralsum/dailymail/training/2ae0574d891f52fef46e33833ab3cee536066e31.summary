tv shows , movies and books are full of suggestions of where to hide out from a zombie apocalypse , but researchers at @entity7 claim to have found the safest place			1
@entity9 and his band of refugees from @entity12 in ' @entity13 ' tried a remote farmhouse and a prison ; ' @entity16 ' had survivors holed up in a shopping mall ; and ' @entity19 ' proposed the local pub. it 's fair to say that most of these hideouts did not work out that well for those involved			0
researchers from @entity7 have now discovered that the correct thing to do should the dead start to walk the earth is to literally head for the hills			2
they found that cities would fall quickly , but it would take weeks for zombies to penetrate into less densely populated areas , and months to reach northern parts of the mountain - time zone			1
their advice is to head for the @entity60			2
the research involved results from simulations the researchers wrote themselves , similar to modelling chemical reactions			0
' modeling zombies takes you through a lot of the techniques used to model real diseases , albeit in a fun context , ' @entity44 told phys.org			1
there are four states a person can be in ( human , infected , zombie , dead zombie ) , and these are dependent on possible interactions ( zombie bites human , human kills zombie , zombie moves etc )			0
' given the dynamics of the disease , once the zombies invade more sparsely populated areas , the whole outbreak slows down - there are fewer humans to bite , so you start creating zombies at a slower rate , ' says @entity44			1
' modeling zombies takes you through a lot of the techniques used to model real diseases , albeit in a fun context , ' said researcher @entity44 the research team were inspired by a graduate statistical mechanics class and by reading ' @entity97 ' by @entity98			1
the @entity99 uses a zombie apocalypse as a learning tool to teach emergency preparedness ' i 'd love to see a fictional account where most of @entity105 falls in a day , but upstate @entity105 has a month or so to prepare			0
' the researchers aim to add more complicated social variables to their simulation such as awareness of the outbreak and ability to make a run for it			2
the group were inspired by graduate statistical mechanics class and by reading ' @entity97 : an oral history of the first zombie war ' by @entity98			0
indeed the conclusions of their research match up with some of the plot points of the book , which sees the @entity39 abandon two - thirds of the country and retreat behind the @entity60 to regroup before launching a counterattack			0
they found that cities would fall quickly as large numbers people that would be quickly infected as in the movie ' @entity97 ' , but it would take weeks for zombies to get to less densely populated areas like the @entity60 the @entity7 team are less optimistic about our prospects			1
the abstract for their research ends with the line : ' we build up to a full scale simulation of an outbreak in the @entity39 , and discover that for " realistic " parameters , we are largely doomed			1
' despite this , since 2011 the @entity99 has playfully used a zombie apocalypse as a learning tool for teaching emergency preparedness			0
the group presents its findings during the 2015 @entity150 , on thursday , march 5 in @entity151 , @entity152 .			0

researchers from @entity7 created a simulation of a zombie outbreak using techniques for modelling real diseases
they found that cities would fall quickly , but less densely populated areas could hold out for months
with fewer humans to bite you , rural areas create zombies at a much slower rate
their advice is to head to the @entity172
however they conclude that using realistic parameters in their simulation ' we are largely doomed '
