by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 19:41 est , 14 june 2013 updated : 21:43 est , 14 june 2013 @entity2 , the @entity3 valedictorian who had his speech cut short after speaking about his faith , is now being represented by the @entity6 of @entity7 , @entity8			1
according to a document sent thursday , the organization is demanding that the school admit that they broke state and federal free speech laws , and apologize to @entity2 within 60 days or face legal action			1
they say that according to the school district 's own policy , in addition to @entity8 and federal law , the school needed to ' distance itself from the valedictorian 's speech including not editing or drafting the speech , and printing a disclaimer in the graduation program that must read in part that " the content of each student speaker 's message is the private expression of the individual student and does not reflect the endorsement , sponsorship , position or expression of the district			1
' they have the correct policy			0
we just need them to say ' we 're sorry , some folks messed up , @entity2 did n't do anything wrong			1
' sasser the school silenced @entity2 's microphone during his speech when he diverted from his pre-approved remarks and began to speak about the constitution			1
@entity2 , who was accepted into the @entity53 , had his microphone silenced during his speech right after he told fellow graduates that school officials had threatened to cut him off the day before			1
his speech began like any other : ' i ’m honored to stand before you today as the @entity59 ! ' censored : @entity2 , seen speaking here , was giving the valedictory speech when his microphone was turned off because he deviated from approved remarks turned off : up until the point the sound was cut , the speech had been well received gifted : @entity2 's ( left ) classmates at @entity3 called him ' @entity68 ' , not due to any lack of human emotion but because he is ' the most gifted , academically excellent student that @entity3 has ever produced ' @entity2 thanked his parents , teachers and classmates			1
' most people have never ever heard me speak much less see me smile , ' said @entity2			1
he then talked about his faith and @entity78 , ' most important i want to thank @entity78 for giving us the only son who went through excruciating death on a cross … ' then he said it was his constitutional right to talk about such topics			0
' i was threatened with having the mic turned off , ' and right then the mic was turned off			2
@entity2 continued with his speech , but some thought that he had finished and began applauding			1
warning : speakers were told to stick to his prepared remarks , but @entity2 , soft - spoken and headed to the @entity92 , did n't follow the script he continued speaking even though few could hear him			1
@entity94 , a fellow graduate explained what happened to @entity97 ' he just said , he was talking about getting constitutional rights getting taken away from him , and then he said , just yesterday they threatened to turn my microphone off , and then his microphone went off			0
' ' student speakers were told that if their speeches deviated from the prior - reviewed material , the microphone would be turned off , regardless of content , ' @entity103 said in a statement			2
@entity94 : fellow classmate of @entity2 's said that everyone knew the rules about sticking to the script so the silencing came as no surprise @entity116 : another of @entity2 's classmates also believes the school were within their rights to lower the sound of his speech @entity124 policy gives these rules about graduation speeches by valedictorian , salutatorians and class historians			1
' the subject of the addresses shall be related to the purpose of the graduation ceremony , marking and honoring the occasion , honoring the participants and those in attendance , and the student 's perspective on purpose , achievement , life , school , graduation , and looking forward to the future			0

source : @entity103 policy @entity173 ( local ) @entity172 , student expression ' when one student 's speech deviated from the prior - reviewed speech , the microphone was turned off , pursuant to @entity181 policy and procedure , ' the statement said			2
some attendees initially asked if the microphone was turned off because @entity2 mentioned religion			0
however , since the ceremony opened and closed with a prayer , and @entity2 's speech mentioned @entity78 and @entity190 throughout , graduate @entity186 believes it had nothing to do with religion			2
' freedom of speech , ' @entity186 said			0
' he said what he was going to say , they did what they had to do			0
' in addition to being the smartest kid in his class , @entity2 was active in @entity203 and has accepted a full scholarship to the @entity53 , friends say			0
in his speech , he mentioned @entity78 and @entity190 and his religious faith while urging others to stick up for their constitutional rights			0
administrators say his religious comments had nothing to do with their decision to cut him off , noting that other students were allowed to make religious comments which had been pre-approved			0
@entity124 administrators say they censored @entity2 because he began to stray from his prepared remarks			0
' at the time that the speech was deviated from , the microphone was turned off -- and they were told that , prior to the graduation ceremony , regardless of content , ' superintendent @entity220 said .			0
