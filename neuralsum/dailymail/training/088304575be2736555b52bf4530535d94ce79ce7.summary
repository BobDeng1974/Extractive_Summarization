by @entity0 published : 12:53 est , 17 june 2013 updated : 12:01 est , 18 june 2013 it was the prettiest game of this year ’s @entity3 convention … and it ’s not even next gen. but do n’t let its playful visuals fool you , because @entity9 ’s plot is actually rather dark			1
you play @entity10 , a young boy who gets his head ripped off by the @entity12 , a beast intent on capturing the souls of children to serve as puppet guards in his castle			1
starring role : gameplay feels familiar to @entity21 , but there are enough changes to make it unique @entity10 ’s body is cast away but he soon finds a variety of different heads , each with their own abilities , and sets out on a mission to find his original head and return home			2
levels see you guide @entity10 through a series of small acts , each one ending with a traditional curtain fall and quick stage reshuffle before starting again			2
there ’s no ignoring the fact that it 's cut from the same fine cloth as @entity21			2
take the real - time lighting , high - resolution textures and ‘ that ’ motion blur coating every act in a magical @entity46 sheen			1
but where @entity21 ’s narrative felt somewhat tacked - on , @entity48 ’s intriguing story gives a sense of purpose to the campaign and stops it from feeling disjointed			1
platforming sections are well thought - out , with the early demo suggesting gameplay is slightly more action - focused than @entity58			0
combat is more than just jumping on things			0
evasion plays a key part in @entity10 ’s armoury , however , a giant pair of scissors called @entity66 can be used to deal damage and snip away at different features of the environment			0
then there are the different heads @entity10 acquires along the way , be that a skull – which , upon pressing down on the d - pad , makes you do a crazy dance to charm skeletons , or the spider , which can be used to open doors			0
@entity9 does puts a smile on your face			0
and in the year of the next @entity83 and @entity84 , it ’s clear the @entity85 is n’t quite ready to leave centre stage just yet			1
centre stage : despite a dark story , it does n't take long for @entity48 to put a smile on your face puppeteer is out september 10 in the @entity93 , and september 11 in @entity94			1
let us know what you think on @entity98 : @ @entity99 and on @entity100 : @entity101 .			0
