the new @entity0 does not look like the old @entity0			1
@entity1 has a baby face unadorned by menacing warrior tattoos but he is a prize - ring assassin just the same			1
as the real world middleweight champion he is , naturally , smaller than the youngest man ever to win the world heavyweight title			0
@entity1 is the new @entity0 in the ring , but not outside of it @entity1 ( left ) knocks down @entity10 during their @entity13 / @entity12 bout last july he is also respectful of his opponents , unfailingly polite to all he meets , rarely if ever swears in any of the four languages he speaks fluently , often dresses like an @entity18 country gentleman , regularly takes his son on the school run in his adopted @entity21 and has a smile like sunshine			1
but this is where the dissimilarities end : outside the ring			2
the @entity28 known as @entity29 – his middle name is a longer version of his first name – is the most powerful pound - for - pound puncher in the world			0
@entity36 may be the biggest - hitting heavyweight but in terms of comparative size , @entity1 is the most devastating			1
it appears that not even the most thunderous of the light - heavyweights can live with him			0
@entity42 , the @entity43 krusher who flattened @entity44 and recently ended the long championship reign of @entity46 , is reported to have withdrawn from sparring with @entity1 because he was getting badly hurt			1
@entity42 ’s trainer is in denial about that but the anecdotal evidence is plentiful			0
@entity1 has knocked out 28 of his 31 victims in an all - win professional career thus far and @entity54 ’ own @entity53 is next to climb the scaffold , in @entity56 on saturday night			1
@entity1 , dressed like an @entity18 country gentleman , during a visit to @entity59 to promote his fight @entity0 ( right ) in action against @entity62 in @entity63 in august 1995 @entity0 is pictured in modern day guise , complete with facial tattoos he has not been taken the distance since an eight - rounder all of six years and 18 fights ago			1
nor , since he seems to have a chin as granite as his fists , has he ever been knocked off his own feet			0
that charming demeanour evaporates when the first bell rings			0
@entity1 becomes a destructive monster and if you keep your hands up to protect your head he simply sets about disembowelling you			1
@entity78 , the much - respected and usually durable @entity79 middleweight contender , was crumpled by a single body shot and reports : ‘ i ’ve never been hit that hard in my life			0
’ this man certainly appears to put the wind up even the most accomplished boxers around his weight			0
@entity1 has been trying , so far in vain , to secure big - name fights against the likes of @entity91 , @entity92 and @entity93			1
he says : ‘ i want these major fights but what can i do if they wo n’t get in the ring with me			2
’ @entity1 in action against @entity98 during their @entity100 fight in @entity101 in 2013 it is to @entity53 ’s enormous credit that he has agreed to venture where others fear to tread despite the lure of @entity1 ’s @entity13 and @entity12 world titles being at stake			1
all the more so since this one - man wrecking ball is in his prime at 32			0
@entity53 freely admits that @entity111 and @entity91 were somewhat in decline when they inflicted the only minor blemishes on his record , a controversial draw and a disputed defeat in those respective world title challenges			0
not @entity1 , who patiently built the foundation of his career through 350 amateur fights of which he won all but five			1
the professional steel which is his backbone now was embedded in boyhood			2
@entity1 throws a left jab at @entity126 during the @entity128 middleweight title bout last october @entity129 celebrates after knocking out @entity10 to defend his @entity13 / @entity12 middleweight titles last july two of @entity1 ’s four brothers were killed in mysterious action when serving with the @entity135 army in the 1990s			1
but they knew @entity29 was the most ferocious of them and when they were growing up together in @entity28 they used to challenge grown men to fight the seven - year - old @entity1 in the streets , where he gave them a beating			1
the @entity43 government declined to disclose details of their deaths or permit funerals			0
‘ it was a very hard time for us , ’ says @entity1			2
‘ our family was torn apart			0
’ now he honours the memory of his late siblings in the ring			2
@entity56 ’s sumptuous @entity149 is a world far removed from the grimy town of @entity152 , where his coal - miner father and @entity155 mother struggled to bring them all up			0
but the chandeliers of this casino ballroom will glitter down on either @entity1 hammering out his latest concussive triumph … or @entity53 springing one of boxing ’s bigger surprises			2
@entity163 will be live on @entity164 from 10 pm this saturday night .			0

@entity1 has a baby face unadorned by menacing warrior tattoos but he is a prize ring assassin just the same as @entity0
he is also respectful of his opponents and unfailingly polite to all he meets
@entity1 has 28 *knockouts* in 31 wins during his professional career
