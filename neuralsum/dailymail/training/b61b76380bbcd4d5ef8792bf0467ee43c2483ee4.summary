by @entity0 it 's been served up as both masterful for taking attention off the breakdown of her 10 - year marriage , and moronic for its new - age pretentiousness			1
but the psychotherapist who created the concept of ' conscious uncoupling ' - two words being hailed the ' term of 2014 ' after @entity13 used it to announce her ' friendly divorce ' to @entity16 frontman @entity15 - said she has never met or worked with the actress			1
however @entity18 , who is also a yoga teacher , said the @entity19 star may have been one of her many anonymous online students , with a five - week conscious uncoupling course having been available for two years at a cost of $ 297			1
@entity13 was undeniably aware of the true meaning of the term last week when she announced her divorce on her website , @entity28 , in an attempt to establish their separation as amicable , @entity23 said			1
they have now separated but will continue to ' co-parent ' their two children ' no ( i have n't met @entity13 ) but i teach online courses and i never really know who is taking the courses or not , ' she told today on monday			2
' the company that produces my courses is very careful to protect the anonymitiy of the clients that come in			0
' i think most of us are pretty familiar with an antagonistic , angry process with ending a relationship , but it does n't have to be this way			0
' so a concious uncoupling is a breakup that is characterized by goodwill , by generosity and by respect			0
' it leaves both parties feeling both parties feeling valued and appreciated for all that is shared			0
' its about two people striving to reduce the damage to themselves and theiry children , if there are children involved			0
' @entity23 went on to thank the couple for using their own journey to help and inform others			2
' they took their time of personal heartache and they used it to really introduce an end to relationships that is healthy and less contensious , ' she said			0
psychotherapist @entity18 wrote a seven - week guide to finding one 's true love but , after her marriage broke down , was compelled to write about handling divorce with ease , which she called @entity96 @entity23 told the @entity97 that she first found out @entity13 had used her term when she opened her laptop last week to a flood of emails about the two - year - old phrase			1
however she was also quick to establish that ' @entity103 ' - which she has transformed into a business - was first coined by a friend			0
@entity23 had written a book about a seven - week formula that could attract ' the love of your life ' , based on her own relationship with her then - husband			1
however when the marriage ended in divorce , she felt compelled to write a follow - up			1
she was discussing divorce one day with a filmmaker friend , who came up with the ' concious uncoupling ' term on the spot			2
@entity23 calls this her ' eureka moment ' , and immediately rushed to purchase the url , eventually creating a workshop on the phrase			2
still together : despite announcing their separation , @entity15 and @entity13 spent the weekend vacationing in the @entity128 with their two children			2
on friday night they were seen out with friends at a restaurant @entity13 and @entity15 , meanwhile , seem to be keeping good on their uncoupling promise			1
the estranged couple are currently on vacation together , along with their children @entity140 , 9 , and @entity141 , 7 , on the @entity128 island of @entity143			0
the two enjoyed a parents - night - out on friday at a beachfront restaurant with friendss and were seen sharing laughs .			0
