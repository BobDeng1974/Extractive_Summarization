communities secretary @entity0 said he had no confidence in the figures , insisting no one knows how many migrants will flock to @entity5 the number of @entity8 and @entity9 migrants expected when the @entity5 opens its doors next january was put at just 12,700 , according to long - hidden figures			1
the total , compiled under the @entity14 government , was immediately rejected as ‘ ridiculous ’ by senior coalition figures			2
communities secretary @entity0 said the estimates , revealed yesterday after months of cover - up by ministers , were drawn up by @entity14 after comparing the two countries to @entity20 , which has sent around one million people to the @entity5			1
the document predicts just 4,613 @entity9 , out of a population of 7.5million , will come to @entity5 every year , along with 8,156 @entity8 – a tiny fraction of its 21.4million inhabitants			1
addressing @entity27 journalists , mr @entity0 said he had ‘ no confidence ’ in the figures and that was why ministers chose not to publicise them , though he said they were slipped out on a @entity31 website in 2011			1
the total of 12,769 is very similar to the 13,000 @entity14 ministers claimed would come to the @entity5 in 2004 , when immigration restrictions were lifted on @entity20 and nine other @entity38 countries			1
in the event , more than a million people have flocked to @entity5 from @entity20 alone over the last nine years			1
mr @entity0 revealed that the research existed in a television interview in january , but immigration minister @entity43 refused to release the study , saying it would not be ‘ helpful ’			2
the @entity46 had even sought to claim that no such estimates existed			0
yesterday mr @entity0 said : ‘ these are calculations			0
i do n’t have any confidence in them whatsoever			2
’ he added that he does n’t know how many immigrants will come to the @entity5 in january but hopes it will be lower than in 2004 , when many other @entity54 countries refused to lift restrictions at the same time as @entity5			2
ministers are drawing up a package of emergency measures to deter @entity8 and @entity9 migrants from flocking to @entity5 when limits are lifted next year he said : ‘ last time , we , @entity61 and @entity62 opened up our boundaries , when @entity64 and @entity65 and @entity66 did n’t open up their boundaries , so a disproportionately large number of @entity20 came to the @entity5			1
‘ this time everyone is opening up at the same time			0
if you combine @entity8 and @entity9 they do n’t even meet the level of the @entity20 population			1
’ he added : ‘ @entity9 and @entity8 have a link with @entity66 and with @entity64			1
’ the campaign group @entity75 @entity5 has estimated up to 75,000 @entity8 and @entity9 could enter the @entity5 a year			1
commenting on the figures , chairman sir @entity77 said : ‘ we regard the estimate as much too low and agree with mr @entity0 that it is not a sufficient basis for policy			2
‘ for a start it ignores the two million @entity8 in @entity66 and @entity84 , many of whom are now unemployed and might move to @entity87			2
’ mr @entity0 added : ‘ no matter how many fancy calculations you can make , i do n’t know			0
the truth is nobody really knows			0
‘ all the government can do is be careful about pull factors that might range from the health service to housing and benefits to try to ensure there is n’t an extra attraction to come here			0
’ ministers are making plans to require new immigrants to register to use public services or claim benefits			0
the government is also considering sending home those who fail to find work			0
minister for local government @entity107 denied there had been a cover - up			0
he said : ‘ we have been open and transparent in publishing research			0
‘ this analysis was produced by the last administration , and should be treated with extreme caution given how unreliable their statistics have been historically			0

@entity120 *suggests* 4,613 @entity9 and 8,155 @entity8 will head to @entity5
but communities secretary says he has ' no confidence ' in the figures
