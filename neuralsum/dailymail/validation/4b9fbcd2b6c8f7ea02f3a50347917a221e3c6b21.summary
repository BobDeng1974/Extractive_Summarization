the chapel was constructed in 1787 by @entity49 of @entity50 the reverend @entity51 , along with some of his friends			1

however it soon recovered because according to the @entity80 of 1851 the average congregation at an afternoon service was 200			0
falling apart : the chapel is believed to be owned by @entity82 of @entity50 , but nobody at the company was available for comment today ' come and worship @entity86 with us ' : sunday services at the chapel used to be held at 10.30am every week - and once a month at 6.30pm as well looking down : upon completion in the 18th century , its consecration was refused because builders would not install an east - facing window in and out : it was sold at auction for £ 315 and became an independent chapel , but had an average congregation of 200 worshippers by 1851 used to be busy : according to the @entity80 of 1851 , the average congregation at an afternoon service at @entity8 was 200 surveying the scene : looking out into the overgrown cemetery from the abandoned @entity8 in @entity9 but the congregation had collapsed to an unsustainable amount by the early 1990s , which saw the chapel ’s closure			1

upsetting : the state of the church has caused furious reaction among locals and visitors to the graveyard , who want action all quiet now : sheet music for ' @entity145 ' by @entity146 and @entity147 sits on a pew in the chapel church and graveyard : amongst the bodies that are buried outside are the @entity124 family , who lost 12 members including five children remembered : a plaque on the chapel wall in memory of the reverend @entity156 , a former pastor who died in 1913 aged 71 , and his wife @entity158 sheet music on a stand : the owner is said to have the freehold of the land , while the grave plots still belong to families of the deceased reminder of days gone by : copies of @entity168 - priced at fourpence - sit abandoned at @entity8 in @entity9 @entity170 resident @entity169 has relatives buried in the chapel ’s graveyard , and said he was ‘ shocked ’ at its state after visiting there in 2010			1
mr @entity169 said : ‘ after a long search i was unable to identify the family graves and came away quite distressed at the total and utter neglect			0
writing on @entity180 , he added : ‘ my horror was increased on the discovery that the burial ground is still accepting new customers , as it were			0
‘ i ca n’t help but feel that this is a shocking state of affairs being a microcosm of much which is wrong with our society			1
‘ @entity9 people laid to rest in originally quite beautiful surroundings but now ignored and forgotten			2
how did this come about ? ’ the chapel is believed to be owned by @entity82 of @entity50 , but nobody at the company was available for comment today			0
however , one issue is said to be that while the owner has the freehold of the land , the grave plots still belong to families of the deceased			0
as a gale swept through @entity9 on the night of march 11 , 1864 , a water engineer was sheltering under the new dam when he noticed a crack			1
it was only wide enough to take a penknife , but it stretched along the earthen bank for 50 yards , following a jagged line 12 yards from the top			0
just before midnight the dam burst , sending 650million gallons of water cascading into @entity9 in a disaster which killed 240 people in their beds			1
@entity108 : the dam burst , sending 650million gallons of water cascading into the town in a disaster which killed 240 people half of those who died instantly were children , and around 60 more were killed as diseases swept through the stagnant water in the aftermath			1
but historians claim that one of @entity111 's worst disasters has been largely forgotten because the dead were northern and working - class			0
for years there was no full - scale memorial to those who died in @entity9 , with only a small memorial stone near @entity50 , where the reservoir stood			1
