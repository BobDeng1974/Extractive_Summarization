the @entity1 's black jihadist flag has been obliterated in a devastating airstrike by @entity4 forces on a @entity6 hillside controlled by the militant group			1
in a series of images , what appears to be an @entity12 militant can first be seen standing by the flag on @entity14 near the @entity18 border - after the terrorist group seized control of the strategically important hilltop 4km west of the town			1
just moments later the hillside erupts into flames as the man flees for his life - and the fighter appears to stand his ground against the ferocious power of the weapon , although whether it is indeed a militant has not yet been confirmed			1
the images have emerged as @entity4 and @entity32 jets launched fresh attacks on @entity12 positions in the north of @entity6 - with pyrotechnic tracer ammunition lighting up the night sky and coalition warplanes destroying @entity12 - held buildings with a barrage of air - to - surface missiles			1
@entity1 ( is ) jihadist are seen just before the launch of an air strike on @entity14 near @entity18 border just moments later the hillside erupts into flames as what appears to be a member of the terrorist group looks on , clouds of dust rolling towards them the ' figure ' can be seen seemingly standing his ground as clouds of dust roll down the hillside			1
the pictures were captured at @entity64 , in @entity66 province the hillside is completely obliterated in the attack - said to be launched by @entity4 forces			0

@entity18 , which has riled @entity77 leaders and frustrated @entity78 by refusing to allow fighters or weapons into @entity6 , said this week it would help @entity82 @entity77 fighters cross into @entity83 to help their brethren against the militants the terrorist group was thought to have been pushed out of the centre of the besieged @entity83 city after hundreds of brave @entity77 resistance fighters coordinated fierce street battles with coalition bombing raids - forcing the well - equipped jihadis to retreat into the outskirts of @entity6			2
the pictures were captured at @entity64 , in @entity66 province			0
earlier the flag was still visible in @entity6 - despite @entity77 territorial gains and weeks of sustained airstrikes by @entity4 and @entity32 warplanes			0
it could clearly still be seen inside city , raised over a multi-storey building just a few hundred feet away from where the yellow , triangular flag of the @entity104 ( @entity105 ) was seen fluttering above a largely destroyed housing complex			0
the chilling image of the @entity12 flag still flying in @entity6 emerged as lawmakers in @entity82 's largely autonomous @entity77 region authorized peshmerga forces to cross into neighboring @entity83 to help fellow @entity77 combat @entity1 militants in the city , providing much - needed boots on the ground			2
the unprecedented deployment will almost certainly depend on the support of @entity18 , whose president criticized a @entity4 airdrop of arms to @entity77 fighters after some of the weapons wound up in the hands of the extremists			0
the fallout from a separate explosion after an airstrike seen from the @entity18 side of the border , near @entity132 district , @entity133 , @entity18 @entity134 : smoke and dust rise over @entity83 town of @entity6 after another airstrike , as seen from the @entity139 crossing on the @entity18 - @entity83 border in the southeastern town of @entity132 in @entity66 province today @entity6 has seen intensive fighting over the past few weeks , and @entity77 forces appear to be turning the tide against @entity12 chilling : @entity12 ' black jihadist flag ( background ) was still visible in @entity6 this morning - despite @entity77 territorial gains and weeks of sustained airstrikes by @entity4 and @entity32 warplanes			1
the flag is just a few hundred feet away from where the yellow , triangular flag of the @entity104 can be seen fluttering above a largely destroyed housing complex ( foreground ) a shepherd tends his flock in the outskirts of the @entity83 town of @entity6 this morning as fighting between @entity12 and @entity77 continues smoke and dust is seen rising over the @entity83 town of @entity6 after @entity4 warplanes carry out a bombing raid on @entity1 targets @entity18 , which has riled @entity77 leaders and frustrated @entity78 by refusing to allow fighters or weapons into @entity6 , said this week it would help @entity82 @entity77 fighters cross into @entity83 to help their brethren against the militants , who also are being attacked by a @entity4 - led campaign of airstrikes			1
but it is not clear how many fighters will be allowed in or whether they will be allowed to carry enough weapons to make an impact			0
the @entity77 of @entity83 and @entity82 have become a major focal point in the war against the @entity1 group , with @entity77 populations in both countries coming under significant threat by the militants ' lightning advance			0
lt. gen. @entity187 , the outgoing commander of @entity189 's @entity188 in @entity190 , @entity18 , said the @entity18 have agreed to open up ' a land bridge of sorts ' so that the peshmerga can get into @entity6 to help with the fighting there			0
' it seems to me that between the @entity4 , @entity18 and other countries , they are figuring out what is permissible to make sure that @entity12 is not successful and that it is something that @entity18 can live with , ' he added , using an acronym for the group .			2

in a series of images , a lone @entity12 militant can first be seen standing by the flag on @entity14 near the @entity18 border

meanwhile what appears to be the flag guard looks on as clouds of dust and fire roll down the hillside towards him
