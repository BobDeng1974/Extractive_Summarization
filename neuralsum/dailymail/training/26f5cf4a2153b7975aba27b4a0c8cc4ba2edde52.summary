' just a small island no - one pays any attention to ' ... @entity3 's president @entity2 , left , welcomes pm @entity4 at the start of the @entity7 summit today in @entity8 @entity3 dismissed @entity9 as ‘ just a small island no one pays any attention to ’ last night as a summit of world leaders descended into acrimony over planned military strikes on @entity17			1
in an astonishing attack , @entity2 mocked the @entity9 ’s size and influence , and boasted that @entity23 oligarchs had ‘ bought @entity21 ’			1
however as controversy erupted , @entity3 officials flatly denied the remarks – attributed to president @entity2 ’s official spokesman @entity27 – had ever been made			1
but the episode at the @entity29 hosted by @entity3 underlined the @entity31 style tensions that have been created by the row over @entity17			2
the seating plan at the talks has had to be changed so that @entity35 and president @entity2 are kept as far apart as possible			2
last night , arriving at the summit venue in @entity8 , president @entity35 strode in alone rather than walking in with president @entity2			1
the war of words with @entity9 came as @entity4 continued to make the case for intervention in @entity17 despite his defeat in @entity42 last week			1
they represented an extraordinary breach of protocol , particularly as @entity3 is hosting the @entity7 meeting			2
president @entity2 , a belligerent ally of @entity17 tyrant @entity48 , has been revelling in @entity50 rejection last week of @entity9 participation in @entity53 - led military action			1
but the @entity55 ’s decision to rub mr @entity4 ’s nose in it – with the prime minister on @entity3 soil – will plunge @entity60 - @entity3 relations to a new low			0
told of the @entity3 verdict on @entity9 , an infuriated mr @entity4 insisted : ‘ i do n’t accept that for a moment			2
’ a @entity66 source said : ‘ as host of guests from the world ’s leading countries , i ’m sure the @entity3 will want to clarify these reported remarks , particularly at a @entity7 where it ’s a very @entity9 agenda on trade and tax			1
‘ it highlights how a small island with great people can achieve a big footprint in the world			0
’ chancellor @entity80 insisted @entity9 is ' setting the agenda ' at the summit , on the humanitarian response to what ’s happening in @entity17 , the economic agenda and the tax agenda			1
glum : @entity4 looks downbeat as he sits through the early stages of the two - day @entity88 in @entity89 in @entity89 near @entity8 down the hatch : with relations frosty , president @entity2 and mr @entity4 warm themselves as they arrived for the @entity93 and @entity94 a @entity9 diplomat pointed out that the @entity9 economy was significantly larger than @entity3 ’s			1
there was no sign at the summit that the latest evidence produced by the @entity53 and the @entity9 to back calls for action against @entity17 was winning over doubters , with everyone from @entity106 ’s supreme leader to the pope opposing intervention			1
president @entity2 accused the @entity53 of ‘ lying ’ to justify missile strikes and attacked secretary of state @entity109 for denying that @entity110 was fighting with the @entity17 opposition			1
mr @entity4 attempted to win over opponents of military strikes on @entity114 by unveiling new new evidence of the regime 's use of chemical weapons			1
he also launched a provocative attack on those who had blocked @entity9 involvement in the planned operation			2
president @entity2 , a belligerent ally of @entity17 tyrant @entity48 , is well aware of the rejection of @entity9 participation in @entity53 - led military action as voted against by @entity50 last week all smiles : but the @entity55 's decision to rub mr @entity4 's nose in it , with the prime minister on @entity3 soil , will plunge @entity60 - @entity3 relations to a new low arriving in @entity8 , the prime minister announced that scientists at @entity9 's @entity135 had identified deadly sarin gas on victims ' clothing and in soil samples from @entity114			1
it also emerged that a report prepared by @entity53 spy chiefs concluded that @entity17 possesses a ' longstanding biological weapons program ' , on top of chemical weapons , and may have access to anthrax , camelpox and cowpox			2
taking ' full and personal responsibility ' for the government 's shock defeat over @entity9 participation in military action last week , mr @entity4 insisted he had taken a ' principled stand against the gassing of children '			1
@entity50 - and those @entity159 and @entity160 who joined with them to oppose military action - would have to ' live with the way that they voted ' , the prime minister said			0
mr @entity4 said he had agreed to all the caveats @entity165 had asked for but ' even in spite of that , in my view , they chose the easy and political path not the right and the difficult path '			0
however , there was no sign that the latest evidence produced by the @entity53 and the @entity9 was winning over doubters - with everyone from @entity106 's supreme leader to the @entity179 opposing the idea of intervention			1
host : @entity3 's president @entity2 reads a statement during a round table meeting at the @entity7 summit in @entity8 , @entity3 today opening speech : @entity3 president @entity2 ( in the centre of the picture ) delivers his opening speech during the first working session of the @entity88 in @entity89 in @entity89 near @entity8 @entity106 ’s supreme leader , ayatollah @entity193 , claimed the @entity53 was using a chemical attack in @entity17 ’s civil war as a pretext to interfere in his country			1
the head of @entity106 's elite @entity200 force , @entity198 , went further , declaring that the @entity201 would ' support @entity17 to the end '			1
pope @entity203 also opposed action as world leaders gathered in @entity3 , urging them to ' lay aside the futile pursuit of a military solution '			2
asked in tv interviews whether he was ‘ sidelined ’ at the summit as a result of the @entity212 vote , mr @entity4 said repeatedly : ‘ i do n’t accept that for a moment			0
mr @entity4 said he had not seen ‘ any evidence ’ that @entity3 was prepared to shift position and endorse action through the @entity217			0
‘ let ’s be clear : almost 100 years ago the world came together , @entity3 included , to say after the @entity222 , the use of chemical weapons was n’t acceptable , ’ he said			0
' all the testing that 's been done , including the testing we are doing at our @entity135 laboratories , all adds to the picture			0
' but i do n't think anyone is seriously denying that a chemical weapons attack took place			0
i think the @entity3 accept that			0
even the @entity106 accept that			0
' the question is obviously convincing more people that the regime was responsible			0
' talks : mr @entity4 was seated next to @entity240 chancellor @entity239 at the working session of the @entity7 , with @entity53 president @entity35 ( centre ) and president @entity2 further round the table ( right ) unable to take part in military operations , @entity9 is instead offering an extra £ 52million in aid for the millions of @entity17 who have fled president @entity48 ’s forces , taking its total commitment to £ 400million			1
the prime minister said he had not seen ' any evidence ' , however , that @entity3 was prepared to shift and endorse action through the @entity217			0
but he added : ' i do n't resile from the arguments i made last week - when @entity53 and many others in the world draw a red line over chemical weapons use , if nothing follows from that , that would be very bad for our world			0
' mr @entity4 said president @entity35 had been ' very understanding ' over his defeat in @entity42			0
' like me he is a democrat who believes you have to listen to people , you have to listen to @entity42 and you have to respect the outcome of a vote			0
' @entity9 is n't going to be involved in this specific military action , but the special relationship between @entity9 and @entity53 is as strong today as it was a week ago , ' the prime minister said			2
mr @entity4 is also urging president @entity2 to use his influence with the @entity17 regime to strike an agreement that neither side in the civil war should fire on humanitarian convoys			1
' every 15 seconds there is another @entity17 refugee			2
while we are sitting here in the comfort of @entity8 , thousands of people will be made homeless			0
' they need tents , they need shelter , they need food , they need protection from chemical weapons attacks , ' the prime minister said			0
also at the summit : new @entity293 governor @entity292 , right , is also chairman of the @entity7 's @entity294			1
he is greeted by @entity2 during an official welcome of @entity7 heads of state and government @entity53 president @entity35 listens as @entity3 president @entity2 speaks during the start of the @entity301 host @entity2 : @entity3 's president pictured at the @entity7 round table meeting in @entity8 @entity304 pictured on @entity305 embracing an old woman the @entity179 has condemned global leaders for refusing to find a diplomatic solution while a ‘ senseless massacre ’ unfolds in @entity17			1
in a letter to @entity2 as the @entity3 leader prepared to preside over the @entity7 summit , @entity203 wrote : ‘ it is regrettable that , from the beginning of the conflict in @entity17 , one - sided interests have prevailed and in fact hindered the search for a solution that would have avoided the senseless massacre now unfolding			1
‘ the leaders of the @entity7 can not remain indifferent to the dramatic situation of the beloved @entity17 people which has lasted far too long and risks bringing even greater suffering to a region bitterly tested by strife and in need of peace			1
to the leaders present , to each and every one , i make a heartfelt appeal for them to find ways to overcome the conflicting positions and to lay aside the futile pursuit of a military solution			0
’ yesterday foreign ambassadors were summoned to the @entity339 to receive a briefing on the @entity179 ’s position			0
but the diplomatic efforts by @entity203 stopped short of @entity344 ’s futile attempts to prevent the invasion of @entity346 in 2003			0
the @entity339 denied claims that @entity203 had spoken to president @entity48 by telephone asking him to reduce attacks on rebels			0
meanwhile @entity48 ’s wife @entity351 has used social media to try to pretend that all is well in the country			0
on the @entity17 presidency ’s @entity305 account , the first lady is pictured smiling as she hugs old women and ladles out soup to refugees alongside mobile kitchen volunteers			2
critics say it shows @entity9 - born mrs @entity304 has become a @entity365 figure , out of touch with what is really going on			2
some @entity305 users accused her of ‘ hypocrisy ’ at being pictured caring for young people when tens of thousands of children have died in the two - year war .			0
