by @entity0 these eerie photographs show how a pub and shop have become time capsules after being abandoned for years - full of once - treasured possessions			1
the premises in @entity7 , @entity8 have stood empty since the businesses which once occupied them moved out			1
but the former tenants did not take all their belongings with them - leaving objects from the past to gather dust and providing a fascinating snapshot of life in the 1970s and 1980s			2
creepy : these extraordinary photographs show how an abandoned pub still holds the belongings of a previous tenant outdated : photographer @entity22 stumbled across a set of @entity25 walkie talkies along with their original box technology : an @entity30 typewriter was among the belongings still sitting in the building premises : the @entity34 and @entity36 shop in @entity37 , @entity8 have been standing empty for several years photographs @entity38 captured dozens of evocative photographs from inside the @entity41 shop and @entity34			1
among the items he found there were @entity25 walkie talkies , commemorative souvenirs from the @entity47 and catalogues for @entity50 toys			1
there was even a typewriter which still held the opening of a letter type out on a piece of paper			0
unfinished : a letter which was started by one of the residents is still in the typewriter patriotic : mementoes commemorating the @entity63 are sitting on the mantelpiece covered in dust toys : a leaflet advertising model cars made by @entity50 was lying on the floor of the premises medicine : old bottles of medication were standing on the stairs of the building when mr @entity38 explored where are my glasses ? a pair of spectacles resting next to a home nursing guide by @entity82 ' the front of the building is very photogenic and full of character so i decided to take some shots of the back of it , ' said 28 - year - old mr @entity22 , from @entity89			1
' i found the back door wide open , and i was surprised by the amount of items inside			0
' a toy car , a train set , various pictures hung on the wall , food tins , ornaments , a bedpan on a bed			0
' there was even a typewriter with a letter that someone had started typing			0
tv : a television set with old - fashioned dials was among the many objects from the 1970s and 1980s in the disused pub @entity110 : ' you wo n't find much like it outside @entity113 ' , declares @entity114 's bitter detritus : a view of one of the rooms in the abandoned building in @entity37 drinks : a bottle of apricot brandy stands in the former pub which has stood empty for years ' there were a great number of children 's toys , which made me think about the former residents and why they would leave them behind			1
' the main building was used as a tavern as far back as the @entity134 era , but it is not known when it closed down for good			0
a smaller shop was later built next door to sell produce from the local farm			2
' it 's very eerie being somewhere like this , as it feels like someone is there with you , ' mr @entity22 said			1
' you feel like you 're being watched			0
creepy : a broken glass and jar of @entity148 lend a spooky air to mr @entity38 's photographs another era : an advert for @entity154 's cigarettes , which would now be banned under anti-smoking legislation evocative : mr @entity22 said that while exploring the house he had a constant feeling that someone was watching him necessities : a bedpan was one of the less decorous items abandoned inside the building ' there was one door on the top floor which had no lock , but refused to open			1
i thought it best to skip that room			0
' people are always amazed when they see photographs of old abandoned buildings			2
they wonder how i find these places and how they have just been left to sit like this			2
' through my photography i hope that the profile of this place is raised and someone restores it			0
' closed down : the text of the sign of the @entity182 is becoming illegible with the passage of time next door : a small wooden building was set up next to the pub to sell produce from the local farm ready for a journey : this suitcase was sitting on the side of a room in the old pub bonding : a little boy and his grandfather admire a shotgun on the cover of ' a guide to @entity201 '			0
