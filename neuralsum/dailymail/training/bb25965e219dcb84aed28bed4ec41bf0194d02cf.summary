a group of schoolboys were caught by police after they were pictured surfing on the back of a bus while wearing rollerskates			1
the five youngsters , all aged between 12 and 15 , were stopped by officers after a shocked bystander took a picture of them hanging on to the back of the bus as it drove up a hill in @entity12 , @entity13			1
but instead of charging them after they admitted being carried or towed by a motor vehicle , officers thought of a more productive punishment - they made them clean up the local us depot			2
dangerous : a group of five youngsters were spotted hitching a ride on the back of a bus on rollerskates @entity24 @entity23 , from @entity25 , said : ' as this was a minor traffic offence it could have been dealt with in two ways , either through the courts where a fine could have been processed or a community resolution			2
' we agreed with @entity34 that a community resolution would be the best solution and would give the youngsters time to think about their reckless actions			0
as well as cleaning up the depot , the group will also have to clean @entity34 's fleet of @entity13 buses			1
@entity43 , @entity34 operations manager said : ' we hope that by the youngsters working with us to clean our vehicles and spending time on site with us , it will help them understand the dangers of using vehicles to tow them along			2
' police guidance suggests officers should use them only for low level offences in which no - one is hurt , or for anti-social behaviour			0
punishment : the youngsters , who were filmed by a shocked passer by , were made to clean up a local bus depot and its buses by police earlier this year , a schoolboy nicknamed ' the @entity63 ' was named and shamed by his parents and handed over to police after video footage emerged of him hitching a lift home on the tailbar of a 40 - tonne lorry			1
@entity70 , 12 , was captured on film sitting on the back of the truck as it drove through @entity74 , @entity75			0
his father @entity76 and mother @entity77 both saw the footage on @entity79 and called the police			0
eventually when the @entity83 delivery lorry slowed down at traffic lights the boy jumped off and gave the occupants of the car behind , who were filming him , a cheeky thumbs up before walking off down the street .			0
