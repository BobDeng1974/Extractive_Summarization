his son , @entity26 , died two days shy of his first birthday in may 2012			1
happier times : @entity7 is seen here with his son , @entity26 , who died after drinking a bottle that his father had added methadone and heroin to common pleas judge @entity34 said she based her verdict in the nonjury trial partly on @entity7 ’s conduct afterward , when he gave changing statements to police , including an attempt to blame the death on his five - year - old daughter			1
' i was appalled when i heard that , ' @entity44 says she knows @entity7 regrets his actions			0
he told police his son was ' his heart and soul			0
' the case opened a window into the world of two addicts , mother and father , who sought treatment after their daughter was born addicted to heroin in 2006 , and were seemingly doing well			0
it ’s at least the second case in @entity1 in which a baby died after drinking a heroin - laced @entity62 records show @entity26 was healthy , if small for his age , and there was no evidence of prior abuse or neglect			1
photographs show the house was neatly kept , and the boy ’s mother said @entity7 handled the overnight feedings , and boiled water to make the formula			0
and a friend came every day at 7am to take him to a methadone clinic for treatment			0
loved : @entity7 ( left , with his son ) told police baby @entity26 ( right ) was his ' heart and soul ' struggle : both @entity26 's ( right ) parents @entity7 ( left ) and @entity86 ( center ) struggle with heroin addiction @entity7 told police that he fed his son @entity26 at 3am on friday may 11 , 2012 when he awoke fussy , then found the baby unresponsive in a vomit - covered bassinet at 7am			1
the mother , @entity86 , 29 , who was also in a daily methadone treatment program , said she thought @entity7 had been clean since the 2006 birth of their daughter			2
but a friend who took @entity7 to the methadone clinic every day said he knew he had relapsed			2
the friend nonetheless said @entity7 was good with the baby , and was ' hysterical ' on the morning that his son died			1
' he was pretty good with the baby , ' said the friend , @entity102			0
@entity103 knew that @entity7 was still using , buying both heroin and methadone on the street			2

deadly : @entity108 is a synthetic opiate used in the treatment of heroin addiction when @entity103 arrived the morning of may 11 , 2012 , @entity7 ran outside carrying his limp , discolored boy			1
@entity7 initially told police that he had no idea what happened , and admitted only in a third interview , after toxicology tests came back , that he had done eight bags of heroin after the boy ’s mother went to bed			2
' can you believe he tried to blame it on [ their daughter ] ? ' @entity86 , crying , asked a companion after tuesday ’s verdict			0
defense lawyer @entity130 argued that @entity7 may have been reckless , but did not act with malice , as is required for the third - degree verdict			1
but @entity34 questioned the decision to take heroin while caring for the infant			0
the older child , now six , lives with @entity7 ’s mother and sister , who were in the courtroom to support him but declined to comment afterward			0
fractured family : @entity86 ( right ) is no longer in a relationship with the father of her daughter , @entity7 , after he killed their son ( in @entity86 's arms ) with heroin and methadone in 2012 @entity34 acquitted @entity7 of drug delivery causing death , finding there was no evidence he administered the drugs intentionally , despite the prosecutor ’s theory			1
' in his warped mind , he thought this would be ok ... to make the baby sleep , ' assistant district attorney @entity156 argued			0
a forensic chemist testified that the baby would have ingested the drugs within the past eight hours , based on the drugs found in his blood , liver and urine			0
tests also found evidence of heroin and methadone in the remaining liquid in the baby bottle , which was found on a coffee table			2
tragic : @entity86 's son @entity26 died before his first birthday ; her elder daughter lives with @entity7 's mother and sister @entity86 testified that @entity7 handled nighttime feedings while she slept , and that she did not mix the formula or prepare the bottles in advance			1
she said she broke off her relationship with @entity7 after @entity26 's death , in part because she could not get a straight answer from him about what happened that morning			1
but she smiled as she spoke of how he insisted on boiling tap water for @entity26 's bottles if they were out of bottled water			2
and she described her son as ' always fussy '			0
defense lawyer @entity130 , perhaps pointing to his defense , asked @entity86 if people do n't get groggy or confused after taking heroin			0
she agreed that can happen			0
@entity7 , who has also been treated for bipolar disorder , attempted suicide after the boy 's death .			2
