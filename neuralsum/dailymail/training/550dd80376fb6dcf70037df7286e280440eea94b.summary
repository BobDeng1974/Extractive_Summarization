an endangered orangutan is fighting for life after being shot more than 100 times with an air rifle in a cruel attack			1
the female ape , called @entity6 , has been blinded in one eye and has sustained other serious wounds to her body after being struck repeatedly by pellets			1
she was hit 37 times in the head by the lead slugs , while 67 projectiles penetrated other parts of her body in the shooting , which took place in an oil palm plantation in the @entity20 part of @entity21			1
wounded : a veterinarian from the @entity23 removes the airgun pellets from the orangutan sick : 37 pellets were shot into her head , while 67 peppered the rest of her body ' we 're amazed , but truly thankful , that she has managed to cheat death – but it has been touch and go ' , said a local conservationist			1
the savage attack is yet another incident in a catalogue of cruelty against the large apes which are being targeted by vigilantes working for oil plantation owners			0
as their forest habitat has dwindled with trees being chopped down for the forestry industries , orangutans have encroached onto oil plantations and other properties looking for food			0
earlier this year the @entity49 revealed the story of a mother orangutan photographed with her arms around a baby ape as hunters working for their oil plantation boss moved in for the kill			2
fortunately conservationists were able to save her before any harm came to her or the infant and they were moved to another location			2
but @entity64 has not been so lucky			1
conservationists said the only good news to emerge from the incident is that she has survived and has started to eat at a clinic where the pellets are still being removed from her			2
@entity64 ’s recovery is being aided by volunteers from the @entity74 - based @entity23 , but they are concerned she could die from infections caused by the wounds to her head , as well as those near her heart and lungs			1
the head of the local conservation agency , @entity84 , who like many @entity20 uses only one name , said : ' even though she is eating , she is still , technically , fighting for her life			1
' she has been very seriously injured and she could relapse at any moment			0
but she ’s a true fighter			0
she ’s fighting very hard			2
' added to the fears that @entity64 could still die are concerns that should she survive she might lose the sight in her remaining eye and her hearing could be affected			1
if she survives , conservationists fear she will never be able to be released back into her slowly diminishing world in the wild			0
touch and go : @entity64 could still die of her horrific injuries , but rescuers called her a ' fighter ' she would be an easy target for hunters once again and she would have problems finding food			1
but keeping her in captivity would also cause her distress as she would want to return to a mate or an extended family still in the jungle			0
@entity109 from the conservation group found @entity64 struggling through grassland on the outskirts of an oil plantation and managed to catch her and take her to a clinic			1
' the next few weeks are touch and go , ’ said @entity84			0
' we are all praying for her			2
' six months ago four men were sent to jail for eight months for shooting and beating to death three orangutans and long - nosed monkeys in @entity122 – the @entity20 part of @entity21 , the large island that is shared with @entity124			0
it was revealed after their arrest that the owners of a @entity124 oil company had paid them to drive the apes away from a plantation			0
just 50,000 to 60,000 of the two species of orangutans are left in the wild , 80 per cent of them in @entity20 and the remainder in @entity124			0
international conservation groups are worried the animals are faced with extinction from poaching and the rapid destruction of their forest habitat , which is being swallowed up by palm oil plantations .			0
