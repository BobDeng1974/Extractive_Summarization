' @entity9 told @entity42 's @entity41 show that ' every party has to be tested on its approach to immigration '			1
' no government in the last three decades has solved the problem of immigration , so it is a really difficult issue			0
' asked if he was dismayed that immigration is such a big issue in the election , he replied : ' well i am because i do think we need to go back and say what is our stance towards the world around us ?

@entity9 added : ' what i want to keep saying is these are people we 're talking about â€“ the people who drown in the @entity80 trying to get into @entity81 , the people who are caged in @entity83 because they 're desperate			2
' we have to somehow keep the human person at the front of all of these issues and remember that this city , for example , would grind to a halt without the contribution of people who 've come to this country			1

' pressed on whether @entity94 would set a target for net migration , she said : ' he ( mr @entity17 ) failed in that approach			2
' i think that is the wrong approach to take because what he 's done is he set a target for net migration , he said no ifs no buts he was going to meet it , and in fact the actual level is three times the target that he set			2
' and also a net migration target puts all immigration in together , so it treats students , alongside people coming to work alongside people who are looking for work alongside people who might have come for family reasons , alongside refugees			2
' it puts all of those different kinds of immigration together			0
i think that is the wrong approach			0
