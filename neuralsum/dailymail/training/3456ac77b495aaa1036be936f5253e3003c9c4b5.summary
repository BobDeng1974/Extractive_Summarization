the mother of a teenage girl who took her own life after naked pictures were shared online has written a heartbreaking letter to the boys who destroyed her daughter 's life			1
@entity10 ' daughter @entity9 was 15 when a teenage boy posed for a photograph in november 2011 while having sex with the naked youngster as she vomited out of a window			1
after the image was shared among her friends , ms @entity10 , who has just 15 when the image was taken , took her own life			1
@entity19 , pictured , died on april 7 , 2013 , three days after she tried to take her own life at her home both of the boys involved in the case , pictured , can not be named due to @entity25 child protection laws ms @entity10 , from @entity26 , @entity27 in @entity25 , took her own life in april 2013			1
she was kept on life support for three days until she died on april 7 , 2013			1
the two boys who were responsible for distributing the images are not allowed to be named because of @entity25 child protection laws			1
mrs @entity10 wrote the letter as part of a victim impact statement when one of the boys who was 16 at the time of the incident was sentenced to 12 months ' probation for distributing child pornography			1
the other boy involved received a conditional discharge			1
mrs @entity10 said : ' the photo set into motion a series of emotional turmoil			1
she was 15 years old when that photo started circulating ; the cruelty she received would have been too much for an adult to endure , let alone a child			1
@entity10 , pictured , wrote a highly emotional victim impact statement about her daughter @entity9 mrs @entity19 , pictured with husband , @entity52 accused the two boys of viewing @entity9 as a victim ' her words continue to haunt me : " @entity59 , i ’m too young to have all these emotions , i just want my friends and my life back			1
" " @entity59 , i feel like i am waking each day into a nightmare			2
" while trying to get her the help she required , i lost my daughter			2
she was never the same person again but she kept trying			2
she tried to defend herself constantly			2
' she continued : ' i know that @entity9 did nothing to deserve that type of treatment			1
i know she was not cruel or mean to you [ name removed ]			2
you probably knew nothing about her whatsoever			2
did you know she loved to read , would drop everything to help an animal or friend in need ? that she was bright and funny ? did you know she had two little sisters that she adored ? did you know that the day she was born she changed my life for the better ? after she was born i spent the next seven years in university and she was my driving force			1
no , you would not know these things because you never took the time to view her as a person			2
' mrs @entity10 accused the man of viewing her daughter as an object claiming that not only her family had suffered a huge loss but so did society in general			1
she added : ' a spotlight has been cast on the distribution of photos without consent and my only hope is that others will continue to learn from our tragedy			0
' i want to read an excerpt that @entity9 wrote in her high school journal just two months before the night in november 2011			1
i struggled and spent time contemplating whether to go ahead and write another victim impact statement			2
every time i thought of writing one the thought would follow with " why bother ? what i say will have no impact on him or how he thinks moving forward in life			1
" then came the realization that i was looking at this statement all wrong			0
i do n’t have to speak to change your view , values and perspectives at all			0
that ’s where i was stuck			0
i was stuck with wanting you to feel pain , remorse , regret			0
what a huge additional burden to carry because how could i possibly achieve that goal ? i can not			0
i also can not feel defeated by succumbing to silence			0
no , that would be a shame for everyone who has been helped , everyone who found their voice and made changes in their community because @entity9 ’s voice came forward			1
her voice was not heard while she struggled to be heard , but it sure is now			0
every day , i wake to a huge emotional void of love that i once called @entity9			1
i promised @entity9 the first day i met her that i would protect her and nourish her life in every way possible			1
i did not foresee that i would have to shield her from such cruelty that she endured before she left this world			0
i was unable to console her as she crumbled emotionally after that photo was taken and circulated			0
people often say " how can someone ’s life come crumbling down due to a photo ? " i ’m here to say that is exactly what happened			2
i watched every moment of the tower crumble			0
@entity9 ’s tower of strength and the vibrance of a young person on the verge of embarking on her journey into adulthood			1
while nothing exists in isolation , the photo set into motion a series of emotional turmoil			0
she was 15 years old when that photo started circulating ; the cruelty she received would have been too much for an adult to endure , let alone a child			2
her words continue to haunt me : " @entity59 , i ’m too young to have all these emotions , i just want my friends and my life back			2
" " @entity59 , i feel like i am waking each day into a nightmare			0
" while trying to get her the help she required , i lost my daughter			0
she was never the same person again but she kept trying			0
she tried to defend herself constantly			0
in all honesty , i was crumbling right alongside of her , seeking some sort of resolve to move forward			0
she never understood how someone could be so cruel			0
what could she have possibly done so wrong for someone to share that photo with others ? she could not comprehend that and neither could i. what would be the motive other than to harm @entity9 on a very deep level by ruining her reputation ? a community she once bragged about became one that she feared			1
you may say she was too sensitive , but , you see , that was always her strength			0
@entity9 ’s strength was always that she cared deeply and in the end her loving nature became engulfed in a tunnel of self - doubt and lack of worth			1
i know that @entity9 did nothing to deserve that type of treatment			1
i know she was not cruel or mean to you [ name removed ]			0
you probably knew nothing about her whatsoever			0
did you know she loved to read , would drop everything to help an animal or friend in need ? that she was bright and funny ? did you know she had two little sisters that she adored ? did you know that the day she was born she changed my life for the better ? after she was born i spent the next seven years in university and she was my driving force			2
no , you would not know these things because you never took the time to view her as a person			2
that night @entity9 was viewed as an object , and instead of helping her you posed for a photo and shared it with others			1
she did n't get to see any of those goals listed and she never will			0
i ’m not going to go on about all the struggles i now have to endure just to make it through the day			0
i will say that i always believed @entity9 would make an imprint on this world			1
i just never imagined it would be at such a young age and it would cost her her life			2
our family lost a huge part of us but so did society in general , and in our loss we gained insight , wisdom and direction			0
a spotlight has been cast on the distribution of photos without consent and my only hope is that others will continue to learn from our tragedy			0
