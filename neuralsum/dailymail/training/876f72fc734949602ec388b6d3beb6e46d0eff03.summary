unlucky , ' he said			0
' we had a lot of chances to score in the first half , we did n't			0
in the second half again we had chances , we did n't ( score )			0
' they defend and the first time they were there ( in attack ) they score a goal			0
after that , everybody ( got ) behind ( the ball ) against a team that tried everything and a team ( in which ) every player went to the last seconds			2
' we wanted to play more football but it was not possible because a few things i thought did n't belong any more to top - level football but still belongs - the ball disappeared , the ball does n't come , another ball comes , the ball boys run away - these kind of situations that unfortunately are still part of the game			2
' @entity13 came off the bench to score both goals for the home side in their win @entity4 fell to their first @entity67 defeat in 15 games this season @entity69 could make an immediate return after suspension for @entity4 's @entity73 clash with @entity74 on wednesday			1
@entity4 boss @entity0 allowed @entity69 to enjoy a ' holiday ' while forced to sit out saturday 's defeat			1
@entity77 midfielder @entity69 lost his record of starting all @entity4 's @entity67 games after picking up his fifth booking of the season in the 3 - 0 victory over @entity83			2
@entity0 could well rotate his squad for @entity74 's @entity86 visit , with @entity4 already assured of top spot in @entity88 and safe passage to the last 16			2
@entity90 looks on helpless after @entity13 scores the second goal for @entity2 ' he has a little bit of a holiday , a free weekend that he deserves very , very much : and he will come back stronger , ' said @entity0 of @entity69			1
' if one player has a free weekend for example , obviously he is ready to play again three or four more matches in a row			0
' i keep saying that i think it 's very , very difficult for a player to play every game in december			0
' so if we have eight matches , i would say the maximum a player can play is seven			0
