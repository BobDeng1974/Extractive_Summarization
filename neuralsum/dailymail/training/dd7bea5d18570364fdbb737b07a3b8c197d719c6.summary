judging by the latest lines from top designers , next season the streets are going to be full of women wandering around in skimpy nighties , barely - there camisoles and all manner of lingerie - inspired looks			1
@entity23 's new collection is influenced by ' hotel boudoirs ' , while @entity26 's campaign features barely - clad models			1
@entity28 has sent girls down the runway in slips and corsets and @entity33 has dreamy white nightie - like dresses			1
always at the forefront of a trend , @entity2 showcased the look at the recent @entity5 final ( right )			1
the fashionista sported one of those bedroom chic @entity23 numbers : a black , lacy slip dress that looked as if it were suitable for only the most intimate of situations			1
it might be mrs b 's style - but can the rest of us really wear underwear masquerading as outerwear ? or will we always run the risk of looking as if we 're emulating mid-nineties @entity51 - or have forgotten the rest of our outfit ? while the @entity56 versions of the catwalk looks wo n't hit stores until autumn , we wondered if you could get away with wearing genuine underwear as outerwear			1
the looks below are almost exclusively sourced from the lingerie department			1

it looks great , and looks nothing like underwear if worn with minimal heels and a businesslike clutch			0
keep make - up and hair natural , and try a classic cream jacket on top			1
@entity93 at dinner this pink body could be worn with jeans in the day or a skirt for a smart dinner			0
its moulded cups and snap back mean it is supportive but still creates curves			0
pair with a chunky necklace to highlight your decolletage			0

the sweet neckline and stylish fabric mean it will look great with jeans for a casual , comfortable weekend look			0
pointy heels will stop it from being too saccharine			0
ok for the office ? nude shades and pencil shapes are huge for spring			0
with a white shirt tucked in and nude heels , this slip skirt is surprisingly smart , but it 's unforgiving , so best for slim , tall women			2
wear nude heels that do n't clash and go for minimal underwear - or risk @entity131			2
@entity134 slip , £ 48 , maidenform.co.uk , shoes , £ 79 , dune.co.uk @entity136 , £ 55 , @entity137 , @entity71 , £ 39.99 , zara.com date night he wo n't be able to take his eyes off you in this racy slip - @entity26 do something very similar			2
it conceals your stomach and enhances your bust thanks to its moulded cups			0
keep styling simple so it does n't look over the top - if in doubt , pop on a cardi and reveal all when you get home			2
just for the bedroom ! this looks lovely , but it 's too shiny and short to be anything but a nightie , and the lacy details and bows are so obtrusive that you could n't wear it outside			2
it is , however , very good quality , a great colour and light and cool , so wear it and show it off - in your own boudoir with someone you want to impress .			0

@entity2 recently caused a stir when she wore a tiny lace dress
but mrs @entity172 knows what she 's about - the catwalks are *dominated* by lingerie
