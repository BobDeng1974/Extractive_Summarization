by @entity0 lifesaver : koalas lower their body temperature by clinging to trees the image of a koala hugging a tree is as @entity8 as a barbecue with a few tinnies			1
that cute pose , however , turns out to play a vital role in the marsupial ’s survival			0
by wrapping their bodies round cool tree trunks , the animals can stop themselves overheating during long , hot summers			1
researchers at @entity20 used radio collars to track koalas ’ movements and thermal imaging to measure the trunk temperature of the trees they chose to sit in			1
during the summer , they sat lower in trees , where it was cooler , and were more likely to stretch out and hug the trunk			1
tree trunk temperatures were up to @entity35 below air temperature , with the bark of their favourite species particularly cool , the @entity32 journal @entity33 reports			1
it is thought this allowed them to transfer heat away from their body , without the danger of dehydration that comes with panting			0
researcher @entity48 said : ‘ access to these trees can save about half the water a koala would need to keep cool on a hot day			2
’ ' our results highlight the important role of tree trunks as above ground ‘ heat sinks ’ , providing cool microenvironments not only for koalas , but also for all tree dwelling species			2
' co-researcher @entity62 said : ‘ about a quarter of koalas in one population died during a heat wave in 2009 , so understanding the types of factors that can make some populations more resilient is important			0
’ the team added that other tree - loving animals , including monkeys and leopards , are likely to use a similar strategy			0
there were once millions in @entity8 , but they were hunted heavily for their fur in the early 1900s			0
last year the @entity8 government listed koalas in @entity89 , @entity90 , and the @entity91 as a threatened species , and some are even warning the animal could face extinction if more is not done to protect it .			0

study from @entity20 tracked koalas with radio collars
they found that in the summer the animals were more likely to hug the trees
researchers found that trunks were on average *9c* below air temperature
lets them cool off without panting - which is dangerously dehydrating
