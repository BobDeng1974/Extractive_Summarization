the @entity18 would have been defenceless against a nuclear attack at that time – they did not successfully test their own atomic bomb until 1949			1
@entity10 and the @entity3 had been allies in the @entity32 until 1945 , the year @entity33 lost office as prime minister			2
but he was one of the first international statesmen to recognise the post-war threat posed by the @entity3 , and in 1946 made a famous speech in @entity40 , @entity41 , about an ‘ iron curtain ’ having descended across @entity43 as @entity14 consolidated his grip on the eastern half of the continent			2

the note continues : ‘ he pointed out that if an atomic bomb could be dropped on the @entity26 , wiping it out , it would be a very easy problem to handle the balance of @entity18 , which would be without direction			0
‘ @entity0 further stated that if this was not done , @entity18 will attack the @entity1 in the next two or three years when she gets the atomic bomb and civilisation will be wiped out or set back many years			2
’ the memo is published for the first time in a book called when @entity72 : the @entity73 and @entity74 , by award - winning investigative journalist @entity75			2
it is due to be published in @entity10 next month			0

@entity75 said : ‘ @entity0 had been a great historian of warfare			0
he saw the last great cavalry charge during the @entity91 and championed the development of tanks			0
‘ i think he saw a nuclear strike as just another progression of conventional warfare , until he realised there was a lot more devastation with nuclear weapons			0

after he returned to power in 1951 , a nuclear attack against the @entity3 was never mentioned again .			1
