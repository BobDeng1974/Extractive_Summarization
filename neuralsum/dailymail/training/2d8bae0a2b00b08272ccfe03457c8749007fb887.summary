by @entity0 @entity2 coach @entity1 has admitted that he fears losing his job at the end of the coming season			1
speaking at a press conference prior to @entity2 's pre-season tour of the @entity9 , the @entity6 said , ' there are no secrets			0
if i do n't win , then a different coach will probably come in '			1
the remark came in the context of concerns that the six members of @entity2 's side who had just won the @entity19 with @entity20 would suffer under lack of motivation upon returning to club football			1
' we ca n't allow ourselves a phase like that ' , said @entity42			0
@entity1 , though , whose @entity49 winning @entity52 team of 2011 also contained newly crowned @entity19 winners , is adamant that @entity20 's triumph is a good thing for his side			1
' i am happy for @entity20 that they won the @entity19			1
it is a great gift for @entity2 that six of our players were able to contribute to it			2
' easy does it : @entity1 has been sporting a casual look as he guides @entity2 through pre season nonetheless , further success is absolutely expected this season of @entity1 and his team			1
the @entity6 begins the second year of his three year contract this summer , and despite winning the @entity74 and the @entity75 in record time last season , @entity2 's exit to @entity73 in the @entity49 was enough to keep the jury out on their new coach			2
@entity81 success is the reference point for judging @entity1 's success at @entity2			0
after taking over a treble winning team , and leading them to a record double , anything short of the @entity49 title this year will be considered a failure for @entity1			0
concern : the former @entity52 boss is under pressure to succeed after his @entity49 disappointment the @entity95 press are already ramping up the pressure , with tabloid @entity97 publishing a survey which showed @entity2 as clear @entity49 favourites for next season			2
@entity1 knows himself that failure to win the tournament again may put his job at risk			0
he remains determined to avoid such a fate , and cool in the face of the pressure			0
' i am here to do my job to the best of my abilities , just as i used to at @entity52 ' he told the press			0
beautiful day : @entity30 kisses the ground in @entity95 after arriving back from the @entity19 @entity115 welcomes victorius @entity20 team home			2
