by @entity0 @entity1 announced on tuesday that every householder connected to the internet will have their access to online porn blocked unless they ask to receive it			2
and while many people are heralding the ' opt - in ' porn restrictions as a success , dr @entity14 - research scientist , and writer , who , until her identity was revealed in november 2009 , was known by the pen name @entity14 - has shed some interesting light on the new development			2
writing on @entity22 , she said : ' one big assumption seems to be that only blokes will opt - in to porn , because the widespread myth is that only men watch it			1
but women seek out hardcore content too			1
' @entity14 writer dr @entity14 says @entity1 's internet porn ' opt - in ' system wo n't stop women watching sex online she goes on to explain that women do n't just seek hardcore content in erotic fiction such as @entity37 but also online			1
she revealed that @entity39 search terms such as ' porn , ' and ' @entity41 ' are more likely to be entered by men than by women , however , generic words such as ' sex , ' are equally as likely to be entered by women and they are actually more likely to type ' adult sex , ' ' free sex , ' and ' cyber sex ' than men are			1
she maintains that the searches demonstrate the extent to which the internet has helped remove stigma for women who seek out porn			1
' the fact that women are porn consumers too is not something you hear a lot about - you 're far more likely to hear shock stats about the number of 12 year - olds looking at porn than adult women , even though the latter category hugely outnumbers the former , ' she adds			2
dr @entity14 - research scientist , and writer , who , until her identity was revealed in november 2009 , was known by the pen name @entity14 - found that many women watch porn online , too dr @entity14 was writing in response to @entity1 's unveiling of a raft of reforms to shield children from ' poisonous ' websites that are ' corroding childhood '			1
by the end of next year , all 19million @entity76 homes currently connected to the net will be contacted by service providers and told they must say whether family - friendly filters that block all porn sites should be switched on or off			0
from the end of this year , all new customers setting up a broadband account or switching provider will have the filters automatically switched on unless they opt to disable them to allow sites with ‘ adult content ’			0
but dr @entity14 outlines her concern that the new regulations conflate ' the adult and consensual with the obviously deviant and criminal '			0
in light of the news			0
she concludes : ' and for the silent majority out there of women who have watched porn and probably would do so again , will this herald a surge in signups to private browsing services ? possibly			0
' but my guess is that lots of ladies will simply go back to that old faithful , lo - fi option : the paperback rack			0
