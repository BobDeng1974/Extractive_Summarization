a former star pupil at one of the country ’s leading state grammars faced a backlash yesterday after claiming the school is rife with racism , sexism and homophobia			1
@entity9 , who is now studying @entity10 at @entity11 , claimed pupils at @entity13 in @entity14 , @entity15 , made monkey noises at him when he dated a black girl			1
in an extraordinary online post , he also said a culture of ‘ superiority ’ was drilled into pupils and that girls were treated as having ‘ secondary value ’ and were regularly ‘ groped , bullied and harassed ’			2
as well as bringing him academic success , he said the school ‘ taught him to hate ’			2
but his scathing remarks prompted a backlash among pupils and alumni who challenged his view of the 358 - year - old school , which is all - boys until the sixth - form and allows some pupils to board for £ 10,230 a year			1
supporters of the school included old boy and @entity39 presenter @entity39 who said he ‘ only had positive things to say ’ about his time there			1
comments posted online described the claims as ‘ exaggerated ’ or accused mr @entity9 , who achieved the school ’s highest gcse results with 11 a * s in 2010 , of blaming the school for the ‘ pathetic opinions he held as a teenager ’			1
the school itself has refuted the claims and said it was ‘ saddened ’ by the article , written for online student newspaper the @entity57			0
i dated a black girl when i was 17			1
when my school friends found out , some of them laughed openly in my face … they made monkey noises when one of the three black guys in my year walked into a room , people would sometimes hide their possessions as a joke , because ‘ all * * * * * * s are thieves ’ if [ a friend who has since come out as gay ] had gone public with this information at school , he would have been laughed at and ostracised			1
at @entity13 ’ , they were a source of derision and disgust girls were generally treated as objects , to be called ‘ fat ’ and ‘ ugly ’ and ‘ stupid ’			0
they were of secondary value @entity13 ’ drilled into us that the strong were always superior to the weak the post appears to have divided opinion , with some ex-pupils backing elements of mr @entity9 ’s assertions about the school ’s culture			1
former pupil mr @entity39 said : ‘ i was at the school for seven years and it was the best seven years of my life – and i only have positive things to say about the school			1
’ however , @entity96 , also a former pupil , said he took the article ‘ as a personal attack on me , my friends and the best seven years of my life			0
' he said he could ‘ wholeheartedly say i never once saw an act of homophobia or racism			0
' but he added : ‘ first off , the school does have a problem with lad culture			0
looking back , my participation does n’t fill me with much pride			0
at times i was more concerned with binge drinking , showing off and objectifying women than i was about my grades			0
‘ i ’m also ashamed to admit that we were undeniably sexist			0
this is n’t just an @entity13 or a grammar school problem but a nationwide issue			0
a lot of our teachers were women and they certainly did n’t approve of chauvinistic behaviour			0
’ in response to the article the school , which has more than 860 pupils , said in a statement : ‘ we disagree wholeheartedly with the view that @entity13 ’ supports racism , sexism and homophobia			2
‘ in fact , precisely the opposite is the case : we make every effort to educate our pupils to be tolerant and respectful of diversity , and to counter prejudices that are , sadly , still all too common in the world outside school			2

@entity9 gained 11 a * s at @entity139 in @entity14 , @entity15
@entity141 claimed fellow pupils made monkey noises when he dated black girl
remarks prompted backlash from fellow students who loved the school
@entity39 *'s* @entity39 said he ' only had positive things to say '
