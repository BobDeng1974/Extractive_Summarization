@entity0 and @entity1 have been boosted by the news that @entity3 is set to return to @entity5 action before the @entity6			1
the 26 - year - old @entity8 prop had surgery to repair damaged ligaments after dislocating his shoulder playing against @entity12 in september and missed @entity0 ’s autumn campaign			1
that followed an intensely frustrating previous season which saw him need surgery on both knees			2
@entity3 has played a full role in training in recent days and @entity22 coach @entity21 even considered starting him in the derby clash with @entity24 at @entity25 on saturday			1
@entity0 and @entity8 prop @entity3 has played a full part in training for @entity1 this week the 26 - year - old loosehead has been out of action since he dislocated his shoulder against @entity12 in september but a specialist has recommended an extra week on the sidelines meaning that , bar any last - minute setbacks , the 19 - cap prop will start against @entity35 at @entity36 on december 27			1
‘ @entity3 is training well and is ready to go , ’ a @entity22 insider said on wednesday			1
‘ he could have played this weekend but medical advice says he should be given the full 12 weeks to recover from the surgery			1
’ @entity3 ’s pending return is excellent news for @entity42 and his coaching team following a difficult autumn spell which saw @entity0 ’s squad severely depleted by injury			2
@entity47 and @entity0 lock @entity48 saw a specialist on wednesday following a slower - than - expected recovery from a neck injury which continues to threaten his @entity53 participation			2
@entity3 starred for the @entity8 in their series victory over @entity56 in 2013 and scored a try in the third test but @entity5 champions @entity22 are in rude health			1

@entity22 yesterday confirmed that seven players , including @entity0 hooker @entity66 and lock @entity67 , have signed contract extensions			0

@entity3 's return is a welcome boost for @entity0 as @entity48 is expected to miss the @entity53 @entity81 rules make overseas - based players ineligible for @entity0 selection and while @entity66 ’s proposed deal to move to @entity85 would have begun after next year ’s @entity87 , the 61 - cap hooker admits the threat of international exile was the biggest factor in his decision to stay			1
‘ it was n’t a straightforward decision , ’ he said			0
‘ i ’m in my 10th season at @entity22 and i had to seriously consider the pros and cons. i thought it might be time for a new challenge			0
‘ i ’ve been here for a long time and also that new challenge would have meant a significant pay rise			0
but when i weighed it up , the ultimate for me is playing for @entity0 and if i went , i would n’t be able to do that			0
‘ if i had gone , i still would have been eligible for the @entity87 , but after that i ’d have drawn a line under playing for @entity0			2
that was one of the biggest blocks to stop me from going			0
’ l @entity35 on wednesday night confirmed @entity74 ’s story from october that @entity56 lock @entity111 , 29 , will join them after the @entity87			1
@entity35 director of rugby @entity112 said : ‘ @entity111 is known around the world not only for his uncompromising style of play but also for his strength of character			2
