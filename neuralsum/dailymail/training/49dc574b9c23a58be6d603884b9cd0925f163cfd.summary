by @entity0 a holy man uttering a special chant succeeded today in calming a group of snarling tigers that had chased five men up a tree , leaving them trapped there for nearly five days			1
as the holy man uttered his mantra - a mind - calming chant that originates in ancient @entity13 - the tigers turned tail and slipped back into the @entity16 jungle , allowing the desperate men to come down from their precarious perch in the branches			1
during the long days and nights they had been trapped there , the tigers , which had already killed and eaten a sixth member of their group , prowled around the base of the tree waiting for a chance to grab one or more of the men			1
a @entity30 tiger attacked and killed a sixth member of the party after they accidentally killed a cub while tigers can climb trees , it is believed the terrified men , from a village in @entity41 province on the island of @entity43 , had lodged themselves onto slender branches that would not have borne the wait of a tiger			1
but as the hours and the days went by they became weak from hunger and lack of sleep , each of them fearing they would fall and become another victim of the tigers			0
the animals had chased the men - who had gone into the jungle in the @entity58 early last week to look for a special wood that is used to make incense - after they had unwittingly killed a tiger cub in a trap that had been set to catch deer			1
finding the cub dying from its injuries , the pack of tigers gave chase after the men and caught one , named only as @entity71			1
he was quickly torn apart and half his body consumed			0
they are trapped up a tree in @entity75 , north @entity43 , @entity16 the men , from @entity78 village in @entity41 , northern @entity43 , had gone into the dense forest in search of agar wood , which is very rare , expensive and used in the production of incense and aromatic oils			2
just 1lb of agar wood can fetch up to £ 175 , resulting in villagers risking their lives to enter the jungles of the @entity75 where tigers and dangerous elephants roam			0
yesterday police chief @entity91 explained why officers had been powerless to intervene			0
' we ca n't go rushing in to rescue the men in the tree because of the remoteness and because of the tigers still being there at the base of the tree , ' he said			2
he told the @entity101 that villagers enter the jungle to look for the pricey wood but they were risking their lives doing so			0
' the group were attacked by tigers on thursday after they caught and killed a tiger cub in a snare meant to catch a deer			1
' nearby tigers drawn to the scene of the fatally injured cub pounced on the men and killed 28 - year - old @entity71 as the five others climbed a tree to safety			1
' just 1lb of agar wood can fetch up to £ 175 , resulting in villagers risking their lives to enter the jungles of the @entity75 where tigers and dangerous elephants roam ( stock image ) resident of @entity78 village learned of the men 's fate because not only were they carrying mobile phones , they had also managed to get a signal , enabling them to call for help			0
but as rescuers from the village neared the tree they saw @entity71 's partially eaten remains and four large tigers - and fled			2
but police said they had little choice but to plan the rescue carefully and that would take some time			0
the tigers would have to be shot with anaesthetising darts due to their endangered numbers			0
conservationists said they had no doubt that the tigers chased the men seeking revenge for killing the cub			2
more than 100 @entity30 tigers are believed to roam the forests of the @entity75			1
but there are fears their numbers will dramatically drop as the rainforest shrinks and palm oil plantations take their place			0
looking for food , tigers are more frequently entering villages and there have been a number of attacks on humans .			0
