by @entity0 nature not nurture : men are more likely to be gay if they have older brothers , according to a series of studies the more older male siblings a man has , the greater chance he will be gay , according to a series of studies			1
scientists say the phenomenon can not be explained by the youngest boy being babied and mollycoddled or other differences in the way they are brought up			2
instead , it has a biological basis , claim researchers			0
they believe the immune response a woman mounts against having a male baby in her womb increases with each son , raising the odds of ‘ feminising ’ the foetus ’s developing brain			1
in one study , @entity30 scientists collected data from almost 1,000 men , including some who had been adopted or brought up with stepbrothers and stepsisters			1
this revealed that having lots of brothers raised a man ’s odds of being gay – but only if they were blood brothers			2
stepbrothers did not have an effect , the research by @entity45 in @entity46 found			2
however , biological brothers who were brought up separately did			0
this suggests that the link can be explained by nature rather than nurture , @entity49 reports			0
each older brother raised the odds that a man was homosexual by a third			1
this means that if a first - born son has a 3 per cent chance of being gay , the figure for the second son will be 4 per cent			0
hormones : scientists believe the immune response a woman mounts against having a male baby in her womb increases with each son , raising the odds of ' feminising ' the foetus 's developing brain by the fourth son , the odds will have more than doubled			1
it is thought that carrying a male baby in the womb triggers an immune response in the mother , creating antibodies that attack part of the unborn child ’s brain linked to sexual orientation			1
@entity49 claims : a study revealed that having lots of brothers raised a man ¿ s odds of being gay ¿ but only if they were blood brothers this response gets stronger the more boys a woman carries , raising the odds of homosexuality			1
genetics and exposure to hormones in the womb are also likely to be important , while some argue that upbringing plays a role in sexuality			2
female foetuses do not provoke the same reaction and no link has been found between having lots of sisters and lesbianism			1
this week ’s @entity49 reviews other studies that link physical and psychological traits to a person ’s place in the order of siblings – or parity			0
studies show eldest children to be more cautious but also more intelligent			0
middle children tend to be more sociable while youngest children are less likely to suffer from allergies and asthma			0
the science magazine states : ‘ not all younger siblings will be spoilt and allergy - free , not all middle - borns will be social butterflies and not all older siblings will be tall , intelligent , responsible leaders , but our place in parity provides fascinating insights into the complexity that makes each of us unique			0

@entity30 scientists found each older brother raises odds of homosexuality by a third
carrying a male foetus causes an immune reaction in a women 's body
it causes antibodies to attack part of the developing male brain linked to sexuality
