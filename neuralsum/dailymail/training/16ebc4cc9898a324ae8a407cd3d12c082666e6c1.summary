by @entity0 published : 14:06 est , 4 february 2013 updated : 02:42 est , 5 february 2013 @entity2 ’s @entity1 has been cleared of wrongdoing despite hundreds of complaints from viewers over obscene jokes about the @entity7 and singer @entity8			1
in a verdict which shocked mps and campaigners , @entity9 yesterday said it would not investigate the show			1
the programme , broadcast on december 30 last year , led to 180 complaints to the media watchdog and a further 150 to @entity2			1
@entity9 started an investigation after @entity18 and @entity19 made a raft of vulgar jokes on the broadcast comedy star @entity18 and actor @entity19 seemed to be drunk and made crude remarks about the @entity7 , @entity24 , @entity25 and @entity8			1
but today @entity9 decided not to launch an investigation into the programme			1
spokesman @entity28 said : ' we assessed the complaints and decided not to investigate for a number of reasons			2
' it was a post-watershed programme which started at 9pm and was preceded by a warning of strong language and adult humour			2
@entity18 , pictured as the furore over the show grew ' we considered that the issues raised by the complainants did not warrant further investigation because the incidence of potentially offensive material was justified by the context in which it was presented			2
' he said the material in a programme of this nature met the expectations of its audience			2
he added : ' we took account of the fact that the programme had been broadcast by @entity2 since 2007			1
' it is a well - established programme and known for its incidence of challenging comments and risque humour			0
' on @entity60 , the day after the broadcast , @entity2 issued a statement saying : ' @entity62 is a well - established comedic and satirical review of the year 's events with well - known guests and was broadcast after the watershed with appropriate warnings			1
' it is believed that @entity2 received hundreds of complaints over the programme			1
@entity71 star @entity19 dismissed his role in the show as ' good fun ' after the outcry			2
he said : ' it was good fun , was n't it ? it was a laugh and good fun to film			0
' conservative mp @entity80 , who sits on the @entity81 , said @entity9 should carry out a full review of the show			1
he added : ‘ decisions like these start to make the case for an organisation like @entity9 being replaced by an organisation with more gumption and sharper teeth			1
’ @entity91 , a fellow @entity92 mp , said : ‘ i am disappointed that @entity9 has not taken this issue seriously			1
‘ these comments caused gross offence and went beyond the realms of decency			0
i ’m surprised @entity9 has decided not to investigate a matter that caused offence to hundreds of people through the country			1
it needs to be far more robust			0
’ @entity9 said it was not investigating the show , which was also repeated , because it aired after the watershed , was preceded with a warning and was in line with ‘ audience expectations ’ for a satirical show			1
@entity2 executives have made no comment			2
the @entity1 of 2012 was far from unusual among programmes billed as ' light entertainment ' , in the way it revelled in smut and cruel humiliation @entity18 , who made some of the off - colour jokes , comes from a privileged background			0
his father is @entity121 , 72 , a former theatrical agent turned producer			0
his clients over the years have included @entity125 , @entity126 , @entity127 , ­ @entity128 and @entity129			0
mother @entity130 , 51 , is a former actress ( stage name @entity132 ) who retrained as a ' doula ' — someone who assists a pregnant woman before , during and after childbirth			0
@entity18 has a sister @entity136 , 23 , and 20 - year - old brother , @entity137			0
his godfather is actor @entity139 , an old showbiz friend of both his parents			0
last year , the family sold their six - bedroom house overlooking @entity144 for £ 4.25 million and moved to another house overlooking the @entity146 nearby , for which they paid £ 2.55 million			0
the new property is mortgage - free			0
he was privately educated at @entity150 in @entity151 and £ 24,000 - a - year ­ @entity152 in @entity153			0
another pupil , the @entity154 , then @entity155 , was five years his senior .			0

@entity9 will take no action against @entity2 for @entity62
