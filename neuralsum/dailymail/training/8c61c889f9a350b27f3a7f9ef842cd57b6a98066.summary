dishonesty : the report claims dishonesty is endemic in the army on all levels , discovering personnel expect to not be told the truth at certain points , and accusing officers of becoming ' ethically numb ' ( @entity29 picture ) the report 's executive summary also claims ' much of the deception and dishonesty ... is actually encouraged and sanctioned by the military institution '			1
