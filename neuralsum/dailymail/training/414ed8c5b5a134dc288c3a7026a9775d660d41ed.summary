they look like something from a science fiction film in the @entity3 , but these unusual ' sea suites ' could be the holiday accommodation of the future			0
a designer has come up with a concept for egg - like villas which can be used as houseboats , floating lodges and beach houses plopped right on the sand			2
the ' mini island ' concept from @entity16 was shortlisted in the @entity17 and @entity18 and now the designs could become a reality			1
but even the most basic two - bedroom model with cost from £ 750,000 ( $ 115,000 )			0
there is even the chance to customise the design with plunge pools and @entity48 on the terrace , log fires in the lounge and even skylights for stargazing at night			0
and if you want to add in an undersea room , you 'll need to shell out another £ 98,000 ( $ 150,000 )			0
the luxury space is envisaged as the perfect pod escape on the banks of a river or shores of a lake , or could be bought up as part of a cluster hotel / studio development			1
taking the concept a step further , the design team alongside @entity64 ' cracked the egg ' to create a two - storey version of the original pod , complete with terracotta roof and a deck that encircles the whole design			0
the loft - style houseboat has stepped mezzanine levels leading up to a master bedroom and even more expansive windows to take in the surrounding views			2
and each pod can house a private rear terrace , reached from the lounge , study , kitchen , ' snug ' and dining areas alongside the bedrooms			0
the lodge offers luxury accommodation that is sure to appeal to those who love to spend days out at sea the luxury space is envisaged as easily at home along lake or river side , or a part of a cluster hotel / studio development the high levels of roof insulation , moderation of temperature from its water setting and potential addition of solar panels to the expansive roof creates a sustainable unit for all climates additional cabins provide significant accommodation for families and guests , while a secluded roof deck allows sunbathing or stargazing alike			1
@entity16 , 25 , said : ' this form maximises internal volume for surface area and creates a series of attractive shapes and spaces , but is also readily transportable to almost any site accessible by sea			1
' we 've just scraped the surface of the design flexibility available , from individual houseboat and lakeland lodge to resort cabin , marina office , beach house , and even art galleries and other novel commercial spaces			2
' as well as the standard facilities of a normal home , there are added luxuries like a hot tub , circular balcony as well as panoramic viewing @entity16 's designs offer a modern and luxury floating space that bring a real feeling of being at one with the ocean , while being safe you could get used to a view like this on waking every morning in the floating houseboat designed by @entity16 and partners @entity144 , managing director of @entity145 who co-designed the pods added : ' in the same way that an egg provides a flexible base for many recipes , we see countless opportunities in the development of this design for private or commercial use			1
' the familiar , yet innovate form could be readily deployed along river and coastal sites , and a beach house variant has even been developed			2
' we look forward to working with individuals and companies on the deployment of our firsts units , and are sure that the variety of applications ultimately created will significantly expand upon our preliminary designs			0
' a mobile home with a difference ! this woulnd't be a bad spot to pitch up and soak in some rays in your beach pod the designs follow plans to develop a roll - out mini-island that offers your very own personal paradise			0
measuring some 33ft by 26ft when deployed , @entity16 's ' @entity180 ' is a folding , floating platform , which can be stored in the tender bay of a large yacht and opened out when needed			1
a full programme of @entity16 's designs can be seen as @entity187			1

@entity16 's @entity189 was shortlisted in the @entity17 and @entity18 2014
the floating lodge is as easily at home along lake or river side , or a part of a cluster hotel / studio development
houseboat was designed by cracking the top of the lodge , and adding another level and balcony
