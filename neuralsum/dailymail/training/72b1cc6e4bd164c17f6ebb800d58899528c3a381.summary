by @entity1 reporter last updated at 12:15 am on 6th february 2012 @entity3 ’s former high school is under fire for a spate of suicides by gay and lesbian students that allegedly followed anti-homosexual school policy			1
a recent @entity11 article details the rampant homophobia in the @entity13 - from which ms @entity3 graduated - and how school administrators encouraged teachers to steer clear of conversations about sexuality with students			1
the issue has come to light after a scary amount of teen suicides - nine in the past two years - have occurred in the school district , many of whom were either homosexual or thought to be by their peers			1
rising star : @entity3 , who ran a failed bid for the presidency , is known for her ultra-conservative religious views that interpret homosexuality very harshly many more have attempted to take their own lives leading state public health officials to slap a ' suicide contagion area ' label on the region because of the high levels			0
while @entity3 rose to the national political stage last year because of her failed bid for the presidency , another anti-homosexual campaigner named @entity41 has taken charge of the ultra-conservative agenda in the area 's schools			2
ms @entity41 is the one who first introduced and authored the so - called ' no @entity50 ' policy which told teachers in the district to avoid any talk of homosexuality within the schools			1
the idea that homosexuality is ' wrong ' and the belief that it is a ' sinful choice ' is something that essentially became a school rule as students perceived their teacher 's silence as a admission of fault and blame			0
loss : @entity66 , left , was one of the first students in the @entity13 - @entity69 district to commit suicide in 2009 , while 15 - year - old @entity71 , right , hanged himself in his bedroom in 2010 ' they 're made to feel ashamed of who they are			2
and there 's no one to stand up for them , because teachers are afraid of being fired , ' @entity78 teacher @entity77 told @entity11			2
' lgbtq students do n't feel safe at school , ' he continued			0
at least four of those who committed suicide were openly gay or , at least , perceived to be gay by classmates , and many were reportedly bullied			0
@entity90 in @entity91 , which is the alma mater of @entity3 , is at the heart of a anti-gay - bullying debate because of their discriminatory policies while it is impossible to prove why these youngsters took their own lives , many are drawing a link between their bullying and the anti-gay rhetoric sweeping through school districts in the state			1
one of the most publicized cases was that of @entity71 , an openly gay 15 year old who hanged himself weeks after finishing his freshman year at @entity90			0
his suicide was the school district 's sixth in a year 's time			1
since his death , @entity71 's mother @entity111 has been spoken publicly about the worry she had for her son 's safety as an openly gay teen and battled to get the school district to change its thinking on anti-gay bullying			1
pact : @entity91 school girls from a different district , @entity122 , left , and @entity123 , right , carried out a suicide pact in april because they said they were being bullied waste : @entity126 , a @entity127 student , left , who was openly gay on his @entity129 page , took an overdose and later died in hospital in march , while @entity132 , right , committed suicide in 2009 tragic : the latest case in the district was of 14 - year - old @entity136 ( left ) who killed himself in may 2011 , and he was preceded by @entity137 , ( right ) , a student at @entity138 who died in 2009 the original article , one @entity140 's @entity139 , can be read in this week 's issue of @entity11 magazine she also delivered a petition with over 140,000 signatures to @entity3 demanding she denounce the gay - bullying that was common in the area			1
she never directly received a response but heard through the grapevine that @entity3 responded vaguely , saying ' bullying is wrong ' and ' all human lives have undeniable value ' but never directly mentioning homosexuality			2
@entity13 - @entity69 is currently under federal investigation for infringing civil rights because it refused to add lessons promoting homosexuality to the curriculum			0
several @entity161 students are also suing the district claiming to have been ignored by staff after complaining of being harassed physically and verbally for long periods of time			0
one of the plaintiffs dropped out of school , later attempting suicide while another claims to have been called a ' faggot ' in the hallway while a teacher who witnessed the attack did nothing , according to the suit			0
school employees could not teach that homosexuality was a ' normal , valid lifestyle			0
' the policy was later changed to require staff to remain neutral on the subject , but only if it should come up in class			0
teachers were instructed to say that , if they witnessed verbal bullying of a student perceived to be gay , ' in this school we are required to welcome all people and to make them feel safe ' but they were told not to show ' personal support for @entity161 people '			1
both policies were influenced by two religious groups - and big @entity3 supporters - the @entity194 ( @entity195 ) and @entity196 , which also lobbied to put discredited ' reparative therapy ' materials into schools , according to the website .			2

nine teens killed themselves over a two year span in @entity3 's district
many were either openly homosexual or thought to be by their peers , *prompting* *disturbing* bullying
the school district told teachers never to show ' personal support for ( homosexual ) people ' and they *feared* they would be fired if they did
