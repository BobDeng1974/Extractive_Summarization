by @entity0 it may look udderly ridiculous , but an airlift was the only way to get these cows to safety after they became trapped in a river			1
the herd of eight young cows left the safety of their meadow in the @entity12 in eastern @entity13 and headed for the water			1
it quickly turned into a drama when they decided to go to the other side of the river where the grass was of course greener			2
moo - ve along : a helicopter hovers above the river in @entity12 in @entity13 and hoists one of the cows in to the air as rescuers watch on from below			1
the animals had been trying to reach ' greener grass ' on the other side when they became trapped but halfway across they became marooned on a sandbank in the river that began flowing much faster after a downpour			1
the rescuers put the foolishness down to the fact all the animals were young			0
in the end they had to be helicoptered into the air and lowered onto the bank where they had come from			0
the animals were calmed down with tranquillisers to stop them struggling in the hoist , then hooked up to winches and airlifted to safety			2
udderly ridiculous : the animals wait their turn to be airlifted to safety after getting marooned in the middle of a large river in @entity13			1
a total of eight animals had wandered into the water before coming to a halt on a rocky bank of stones they were then taken back to their field where they were given a check up by a vet before being released			0
despite being cold , they were otherwise unhurt in the ordeal			0
the rescue took five hours , involved two helicopters , four vets , three farmers , and two patrols as well as two police divers			2
' it cost a small fortune and far more than they were worth , but we could n't let them simply be swept away , ' said a police spokesman			0
' no - one can bear to see animals in distress , even if it was their own fault that they got into trouble in the first place			0
' after all , they did n't know any better			0
' hoofing it : the herd of eight young cows set off in to the river on the hunt for greener grass after escaping the safety of their own meadow			1
the animals were calmed down with tranquilizers to stop them struggling in the hoist , then hooked up to winches and airlifted to safety			2
