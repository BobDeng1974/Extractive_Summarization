it was not your average @entity2 newsletter for a @entity5 primary school			2
marked ‘ staff changes ’ , it began conventionally enough , informing parents that mrs @entity9 was leaving for a new teaching position in @entity11			2
it explained that ‘ @entity13 will be teaching year 1 full - time ’ and that ‘ mrs @entity14 will be reducing her hours ’			0
but the sixth paragraph came as a bit of a shock			0
‘ mr @entity20 has recently made a significant change in his life and will be transitioning to live as a woman , ’ it read			1
‘ after the @entity2 break , she will return to work as @entity26			0
’ it then said the school was ‘ proud of our commitment to equality and diversity among our staff and children ’			2
yesterday parents at @entity36 ’s @entity35 in @entity37 , @entity38 , were coming to terms with the fact the popular year 6 teacher previously known as @entity20 – a father - of - one who until recently was married – is now @entity43			1
they told how pupils had been informed that the 32 - year - old felt he had been ‘ born with a girl ’s brain in a boy ’s body ’			0
however some complained that their children were too young to understand how ‘ sir ’ could become ‘ miss ’ almost overnight and were confused and upset			0
mr @entity20 married @entity55 in 2009 and the couple had a son , now aged three			1
he joined the school around the same time and , according to parents , began growing his cropped hair and dying it purple , painting his nails pink and wearing sparkly headbands			2
a crayon drawing of mr @entity20 by a pupil posted on the school ’s website shows him with hair swept back over his shoulders			1
‘ at first we thought he was just borrowing his wife ’s headbands to hold his hair back , ’ said one parent			0
‘ i saw what i thought was mr @entity20 dressed as a woman in town one weekend , but i decided i ’d imagined it			1
’ mr @entity20 is understood to be in the early stages of ‘ gender reassignment ’ , living as a woman before deciding to proceed with a full sex change			1
@entity83 in @entity37 have asked pupils to address teacher @entity20 as @entity26 from the start of the @entity87 term a drawing by a school pupil of mr @entity20 posted on the school 's website complete with long hair the school ’s 169 pupils were informed class - by - class on monday , and at the same time the newsletter was hand - delivered to parents			1
in a statement , mr @entity20 said : ‘ this has been a long and difficult journey for me , and it was certainly not an easy decision to make			1
’ thanking the school for its support , he added : ‘ i ’d now ask for my privacy to be respected so that i can continue with my job , which i ’m committed to and which i enjoy very much			2
’ headmistress @entity108 said : ‘ we understand that an issue such as this is bound to arouse interest for a short while			0
' however , this is a personal matter for our staff member , who has our full support , and we are all working together to ensure it has the least impact on the smooth running of our school			1
’ mr @entity20 ’s wife – who served as a governor at @entity36 ’s – has left their terraced home close to the school			1
but her parents , @entity127 and @entity128 , said that while his decision to live as a woman had come as a huge shock , they were standing by him			2
‘ we love him and her very much , ’ said mr @entity132 , 71			0
‘ we will support him no matter what			0
’ a ten - year - old pupil said : ‘ he spoke to us and said he ’s going to be changing into a woman and wearing women ’s clothes after @entity2			0
' we were all a bit shocked			0
’ @entity141 , whose ten - year - old son has been taught by mr @entity20 for three years , said his children were worried and confused			1
‘ my middle boy thinks that he might wake up with a girl ’s brain because he was told that mr @entity20 , as he got older , got a girl ’s brains , ’ the 35 - year - old decorator said			1
‘ he ’s a great teacher , but my kids are too young to be told about the birds and the bees like this			0
’ mr @entity141 said his son had been told he would be punished if he continued to refer to the teacher as ‘ mr @entity156 ’ next term			2
another parent said : ‘ this is totally inappropriate			0
‘ any teacher who is going to change gender should also change schools			0
’ a school spokesman said pupils would n’t be punished for referring to the teacher as mr @entity20 , but added they would be ‘ expected to behave properly around her ’			1
father @entity167 is angry after receiving the letter from @entity36 's @entity35 informing him of his son 's teacher 's change the letter sent to the parents by the school informing them of the change the message was buried at the bottom of a section of ' staff changes '			1
