by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity3 's sporting director @entity2 is hoping to avoid wholesale change once again this summer			1
the @entity3 made 14 signings during the last closed - season as then director of football @entity6 and manager @entity8 opted for revolution rather than evolution			1
it was a policy which ultimately proved ill - founded as the club fought a season - long battle for @entity15 survival which eventually cost both men their jobs			1
asked if he envisaged a similar influx , @entity2 told @entity44 : ' i want to say no , but when we look at the team ourselves ... ' i 'm sure any fan can say we need a left - back , we probably need a centre - half , we probably need some midfield players , we probably need to replace @entity24 ( @entity24 ) , maybe a centre - forward , so all of a sudden , the numbers are going up into double figures again , and that 's the last thing i want , and @entity18 as well			1
' but we need to improve the quality			2
the starting 11 is very important , we need to have a squad			2
' but first of all , we need to have a starting 11 that can be competitive week in , week out in the @entity15 , so we do need more players			1
' but for me , it 's not so much about the quantity , it 's also about the quality			0
i do n't want to sign players just for the sake of it			0
' moving on : @entity68 has moved to @entity69 and @entity23 has moved to rivals @entity70 gone : @entity71 is another one to have moved on @entity3 's problems last season were compounded by the fact that 13 of their 14 new arrivals were overseas players , many of whom had never before played in the @entity15			1
some managed to adapt , but several did not , and that is an error the club hopes to avoid this time around			0
@entity2 said : ' currently , we are trying to get players who are already established in the @entity15			1
' that 's difficult because they have a premium , they cost more money and maybe they are already happy where they are			0
' then we have to open ourselves up and go a little bit further afield , and maybe we are not set up for that at the moment			0
maybe that was one of the difficult points last season , so many players coming from different countries			2
' maybe we take one step back and try to concentrate on what we know a little bit better than what we do n't know			0
' arrival : @entity106 has joined the club on a free transfer from @entity109 stepping up : and @entity110 ( right ) has signed from @entity112 side @entity111 free agents @entity114 , @entity110 and @entity106 have already arrived at the @entity115 , but the recruitment process has only just started with @entity118 defender @entity117 among the club 's remaining targets			0
@entity2 said : ' we are trying our best , we are working every day and hopefully before the season starts , we have our squad together			2
' but given that we have n't got vast amounts of money , it will probably go to the last day of the transfer window			0
