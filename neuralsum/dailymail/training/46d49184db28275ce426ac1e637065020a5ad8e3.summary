' help me , @entity2 , you 're my only hope , ' says princess @entity3 via a 3d hologram in @entity5 - and that technology has come a step closer to reality today			1
a human - sized 3d video - conferencing pod has been unveiled on may 4th - known as ' @entity12 ' because of its similarity to the phrase ' may the force be with you			2
' ' why @entity17 when you can talk to a life - size @entity19 holographic image of another person ? says professor @entity21			0
all you need is a six - foot tall glass tube with a convex mirror inside , and a 3d projector			1
two people simply stand in front of their own life - size cylindrical pods and talks to a 3d hologram - like images of each other			0
cameras capture and track 3d video and convert it into the life - size image - although for the full effect you need several 3d cameras to capture both back and front of each sspeaker			1
since the 3d video image is visible 360 degrees around the @entity61 , the person can walk around it to see the other person 's side or back.while the technology may seem like it comes from a galaxy far , far away , it 's not as complicated as most would think			0
dr. @entity21 and his team used mostly existing hardware â€“ including a 3d projector , a 6 - foot tall translucent acrylic cylinder and a convex mirror			1
how the ' telehuman ' creates a convincing ' hologram ' , using a 3d projector onto a specially shaped pane of glass the researchers used the same pod to create another application called @entity81 , which presents an interactive 3d anatomy model of the human body			2
the model can be explored 360 degrees around the model through gestures and speech interactions .			0

six foot glass tubes contain ' holograms ' for @entity91
like @entity93 in @entity5
created using 3d cameras , 3d projectors and convex mirrors
