by @entity0 buried deep within volcanic rock of @entity3 , researchers have stumbled across a mineral that is unlike any other crystal on @entity6			1
the purple mineral is ‘ completely unique in its structure and composition ' and contains an unusual combination of elements , including : strontium , calcium , chromium , sulphur , carbon , oxygen and hydrogen			1
it has been named putnisite and its tiny crystals are are no more than half a millimetre in diameter			1
deep purple : the mineral has been named putnisite and the tiny crystals are no more than half a millimetre in diameter , found on volcanic rock ( pictured ) this sample measures 0.4mm and was recovered from @entity32 in @entity33 , @entity34 @entity35 is a newly discovered mineral with tiny crystals less than 0.5mm in diameter			1
it was found on volcanic rock near @entity41 in @entity3			1
the crystals appear as tiny pink spots on dark green and white rock , which under a microscope look like tiny glistening cubes			0
the purple mineral is very brittle and is unique among the world 's 4,000 known minerals			1
@entity35 does not belong to a family and is not related to anything			2
the mineral is made up of a ‘ very unusual ’ combination of elements , including : strontium , calcium , chromium , sulphur , carbon , oxygen and hydrogen			0
it is not yet known to have a practical use but has been named after important @entity65 mineralogists @entity66 and @entity67			0
dr @entity68 , a mineralogy researcher at the @entity69 and the @entity70 , has described the mineral that was discovered south of @entity41 near the town of @entity73 in @entity3			1
the purple mineral is associated with quartz and is very brittle			2
it is unique among the world ’s 4,000 known mineral species , according to the study published in @entity80			1
‘ what defines a mineral is its chemistry and crystallography , ’ dr @entity68 said			0
‘ by x-raying a single crystal of mineral you are able to determine its crystal structure and this , in conjunction with chemical analysis , tells you everything you need to know about the mineral			2
found : dr @entity68 , a mineralogy researcher at the @entity69 and the @entity70 , described the mineral that was discovered south of @entity41 ( pictured ) near the town of @entity73 in @entity3 ‘ most minerals belong to a family or small group of related minerals , or if they are n't related to other minerals they often are to a synthetic compound - but putnisite is completely unique and unrelated to anything			1
‘ nature seems to be far cleverer at dreaming up new chemicals than any researcher in a laboratory			0
’ the new mineral occurs as tiny crystals , no more than 0.5 mm in diameter and is found on a volcanic rock			1
it appears as dark pink spots on dark green and white rock which , under the microscope , look like square , cube - like crystals			0
the mineral is made up of a ‘ very unusual ’ combination of elements , including : strontium , calcium , chromium , sulphur , carbon , oxygen and hydrogen			0
not quite part of the family : the newly - discovered purple mineral is associated with quartz ( pictured ) and is very brittle			2
experts said that while most minerals belong to a family , putnisite is completely unique and unrelated to anything it has yet to be determined if the new mineral will have any practical use , but putnisite has been named for important @entity65 mineralogists @entity66 and @entity67			2
the mineral was first discovered during prospecting by a mining company in the area and was passed on to @entity146 for initial before being handed to dr @entity68 for more detailed analysis			0
dr @entity68 has researched 12 new @entity65 minerals in the past seven years and found seven of those himself			0
two of these ‘ new ’ minerals - domerockite and hylbrownite - were discovered in @entity153 and were named after @entity154 , where the mineral was first was found and @entity156 @entity157 , who was @entity158 of @entity153 from 1882 to 1912 .			0

@entity35 crystals measure no more than half a millimetre in diameter
they were found south of @entity41 near @entity73 , @entity3
purple crystal has a ' unique structure and composition ' and is unrelated to any of the world ’s other 4,000 known mineral species
