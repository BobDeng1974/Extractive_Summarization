@entity5 , 41 , from @entity6 , died from stage 4 melanoma at his home on friday surrounded by his wife @entity9 and his children @entity11 , seven , @entity12 , five , and @entity13 , one			1
@entity5 and his family believed that the immune - boosting cancer drug @entity15 - 1 would be able to shrink his tumors for good			1
his family had been campaigning for access to a clinical trial of the drug , a treatment currently being tested by pharmaceutical companies @entity39 and @entity38 ( @entity38 )			1
an online petition called @entity42 's @entity41 garnered half a million signatures			1
but @entity5 could not convince either company to give him the drug			1
last week , he flew to @entity47 in @entity48 with wife @entity9 for a last - ditch experimental treatment that they hoped would stop the cancer from spreading , @entity46 reports			0
but it was too late			0
after being admitted to intensive care during the treatment , he was flown to his @entity6 home on tuesday in an air ambulance so he could spend his last days with his family			2
' we were airlifted back to @entity6 mid last week			0
we got home in time so the kids could see him			0
it is a tragedy and i am barely coming to terms with it , ' his wife told @entity46 on sunday			0
lost his battle : @entity6 man , @entity5 , died at his home on friday surrounded by his family help us : @entity5 's wife , @entity9 , pleaded with people to sign a petition to ask the drug companies to give her husband the wonder drug ' i need my dad ' : @entity5 's son , @entity11 , 7 , said in the campaign he wanted his dad to stay alive so they can do things together brain tumour : @entity5 did not qualify for the clinical trial for the cancer drugs because he had a brain tumour , among other complications the father - of - three did not qualify for a clinical trial because of a health complication			1
@entity5 said he was told that in order to be accepted into a clinical trial for the @entity92 - 1 drug , he would need to have either no brain tumors or brain tumors that were at least no longer growing			1
dr @entity95 , an oncologist , who is a melanoma specialist at @entity97 in @entity98 , says the drug had the potential to cause brain swelling in people with existing brain disease			2
since @entity5 had brain tumours , he and his doctor worked to stabilise the tumours using a combination of drugs and other therapies			2
after months of monitoring his brain scans , in july , @entity5 got good news : his tumors had not grown , and he qualified for the @entity39 trial			1
but hours later , @entity5 experienced abdominal pain and went straight to an emergency room , because there was a possibility he had a perforated intestine			2
sure enough , he did , and he was instantly disqualified from the trial			0
without the drug , @entity5 's doctor told his wife , @entity9 , that ‘ this is the end of the road ’ , and that her husband had between six and nine months to live			1
@entity5 's story started in march 2010 , when he had a cancerous mole removed			2
although it put him at risk for more skin cancer , he continued to live an active life , running , biking and hiking			0
but in september 2011 , @entity5 said his doctors told him the cancer had returned and had spread throughout his body			1
the official diagnosis was stage 4 melanoma , which around 90 per cent of people do not survive			0
but when he learned about the @entity15 - 1 drugs and their ability to treat melanoma , he saw a chance to survive			0
wonder drug : studies of @entity39 's version of the drug found that 38 per cent of participants in a clinical trial for patients with melanoma saw tumours shrink not approved : pharmaceutical company @entity38 , based in @entity98 , is one of the two companies still trialing the @entity155 - 1 drugs studies of @entity39 's version of the drug found that 38 per cent of participants in a clinical trial for patients with melanoma saw tumors shrink			1
of those who took the highest doses of the drug , 52 per cent experienced tumor shrinkage			0
@entity95 , who has not met or treated @entity5 but has corresponded with him through email , told @entity165 that immune cells typically do n't attack cancer in a meaningful way because of a kind of natural brake function called @entity29			2
there are currently no @entity92 - 1 drugs in ‘ compassionate use ’ trials -- trials for individuals who do n't qualify for clinical trials but still want the drug , but according to @entity95 , if the medication works , ‘ some people might even be cured ’			0
@entity5 ’s only chance of survival was to become an individual case study under compassionate use rules , which give people access to experimental drugs even if they do n't fit into clinical trials			0
