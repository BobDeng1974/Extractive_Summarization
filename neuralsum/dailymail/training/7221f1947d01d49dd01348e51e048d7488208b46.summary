when sir @entity1 announced during the 1990s his vision for @entity3 to field a team of 11 @entity3 at @entity5 in the future , the idea seemed fanciful at best			0
and , in the two decades since , the @entity7 has become an increasingly international game , with young foreign talent squeezing out the opportunities for upcoming local players			0
yet , on sunday , @entity12 could send out a @entity13 containing five @entity14 - the first time that number will have started a match for the @entity17 against bitter rivals @entity18 in the history of the @entity7			2
midfielder @entity20 could be one of five @entity3 starting for @entity3 against @entity18 local lads @entity22 ( left ) and @entity23 are also set to line up for the @entity24 toon keeper @entity25 ( centre ) has been passed fit for the @entity27 @entity28 should be at the heart of the @entity3 defence against their rivals from the @entity32 there have been 24 @entity34 in the @entity7 , and never before have five @entity3 taken to the field at the beginning of the match clad in black and white			1
defenders @entity23 and @entity28 , winger @entity22 , midfielder @entity20 and goalkeeper @entity25 - who has been passed fit to play despite picking up a shoulder injury against @entity40 - are all in line to appear at @entity5 in sunday 's 153rd derby			1
@entity43 celebrates scoring against @entity18 at the @entity44 in his final @entity17 appearance 5 ( 3 starters , 2 substitutes ) - @entity3 0 - 3 @entity18 , february 1 2014 ( @entity28 , @entity48 , @entity22 ; @entity23 , @entity49 ) 3 ( 1 , 2 ) - @entity18 2 - 1 @entity3 , october 27 2013 ( @entity23 ; @entity50 , @entity51 ) 3 ( 1 , 2 ) - @entity3 0 - 3 @entity18 , april 14 2013 ( @entity28 ; @entity50 , @entity52 ) 3 ( 1 , 2 ) - @entity18 1 - 1 @entity3 , october 21 2012 ( @entity50 ; @entity28 , @entity53 ) 1 ( 0 , 1 ) - @entity3 1 - 1 @entity18 , march 4 2012 ( @entity50 ) 3 ( 2 , 1 ) - @entity18 0 - 1 @entity3 , august 20 2011 ( @entity28 , @entity50 ; @entity53 ) 2 ( 2 , 0 ) - @entity18 1 - 1 @entity3 , january 16 2011 ( @entity53 , @entity50 ) 2 ( 2 , 0 ) - @entity3 5 - 1 @entity18 , october 31 2010 ( @entity54 , @entity50 ) 5 ( 4 , 1 ) - @entity3 1 - 1 @entity18 , february 1 2009 ( @entity53 , @entity28 , @entity54 , @entity50 ; @entity55 ) 3 ( 2 , 1 ) - @entity18 2 - 1 @entity3 , october 25 2008 ( @entity28 , @entity50 ; @entity53 ) 4 ( 2 , 2 ) - @entity3 2 - 0 @entity18 , april 20 2008 ( @entity53 , @entity28 ; @entity56 , @entity54 ) 3 ( 2 , 1 ) - @entity18 1 - 1 @entity3 , november 10 2007 ( @entity53 , @entity28 ; @entity56 ) 4 ( 2 , 2 ) - @entity18 1 - 4 @entity3 , april 17 2006 ( @entity57 , @entity43 ; @entity53 , @entity58 ) 6 ( 4 , 2 ) - @entity3 3 - 2 @entity18 , october 23 2005 ( @entity59 , @entity28 , @entity43 , @entity50 ; @entity57 , @entity58 ) 3 ( 1 , 2 ) - @entity18 0 - 1 @entity3 , april 26 2003 ( @entity43 ; @entity53 , @entity50 ) 3 ( 1 , 2 ) - @entity3 2 - 0 @entity18 , september 21 2002 ( @entity43 ; @entity53			1
@entity50 ) 4 ( 1 , 3 ) - @entity18 0 - 1 @entity3 , february 24 2002 ( @entity43 ; @entity53 , @entity60 , @entity50 ) 4 ( 2 , 2 ) - @entity3 1 - 1 @entity18 , august 26 2001 ( @entity60 , @entity50 ; @entity53 , @entity43 ) 2 ( 0 , 2 ) - @entity18 1 - 1 @entity3 , april 21 2001 ( @entity53 , @entity50 ) 2 ( 1 , 1 ) - @entity3 1 - 2 @entity18 , november 18 2000 ( @entity43 ; @entity53 ) 2 ( 2 , 0 ) - @entity18 2 - 2 @entity3 , february 5 2000 ( @entity53 , @entity43 ) 2 ( 2 , 0 ) - @entity3 1 - 2 @entity18 , august 25 1999 ( @entity53 , @entity43 ) 5 ( 3 , 2 ) - @entity3 1 - 1 @entity18 , april 5 1997 ( @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity43 ; @entity57 , @entity62 ) 5 ( 4 , 1 ) - @entity18 1 - 2 @entity3 , september 4 1996 ( @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity43 , @entity62 ; @entity57 ) @entity63 striker @entity49 is also likely to get a place on the bench for @entity3 @entity3 players celebrate against @entity18 in the 3 - 2 victory at @entity5 in october 2005 - the last time six @entity3 featured in a matchday squad for the @entity17 against the @entity18 and , with youngster @entity49 likely to be among the replacements , the @entity17 could have six @entity3 in their squad against @entity18 for the first time since october 2005			1
on that day , @entity3 beat @entity18 3 - 2 at @entity5 ' with the help of @entity59 , @entity48 , @entity57 , @entity58 and their favourite @entity74 son , @entity43			2
@entity28 also featured in the line - up that day and is the only survivor heading into this weekend			0
@entity12 will be hoping the abundance of @entity74 talent will be able to inspire @entity3 and end their miserable recent record against their @entity32 rivals			0
@entity48 ( left ) and @entity62 are two @entity3 to have played for @entity3 in @entity82 derbies the @entity17 have lost three derbies in succession - two matches at @entity5 ' ended 3 - 0 to the visitors - and have failed to win a home match against the @entity18 since their 5 - 1 victory on october 31 , 2010			1
@entity3 have never lost four in a row to @entity18 and , following the 4 - 0 @entity91 quarter - final humiliation at @entity40 in midweek , another defeat is unlikely to sit well with the @entity3			1
@entity3 have lost the last three derbies in succession , including 3 - 0 at @entity5 last season in fact , @entity95 's @entity18 are unbeaten in five @entity32 derbies and appear to have had the psychological edge over @entity3 in recent matches - something @entity12 will believe his @entity74 representatives can rectify			2
and the presence of @entity20 in @entity17 colours as opposed to the red - and - white stripes he adorned at the @entity44 for six years has added yet more intrigue to an already - fascinating fixture			2
@entity20 celebrates after @entity18 beat @entity3 in october 2013 ( left ) and playing for the @entity17 @entity20 made 135 appearances for the @entity18 and played against @entity3 last season ex-sunderland striker and chairman @entity108 has already lamented the loss of @entity20 , explaining that the club did not nurture the 25 - year - old to then see him star for their rivals			1
but with so many local players in with a chance of representing @entity3 in what , for many supporters , is the biggest home match of the season , it fits in perfectly with the club 's ' @entity121 ' idea			0
posters have been displayed , emails sent out to fans and messages posted on the club website advertising the initiative and encouraging supporters to wear their replica shirts , bring along their @entity3 scarves and other attire to cover @entity5 in a ' sea of black and white			0
' this game is huge for both sets of supporters - and for @entity3 fans , they expect nothing less than a victory			0
@entity140 celebrates scoring for @entity18 against @entity3 at @entity5 last season			0

@entity3 host @entity18 in sunday 's @entity27
five @entity3 could start for @entity17 against @entity144 , @entity28 , @entity22 , @entity20 and @entity23
youngster @entity49 could also be among the substitutes
*magpies* have lost the last three @entity82 derbies
read : @entity3 vs @entity18 was always going to be *massive* *...* but with @entity152 *ousted* from the @entity91 it goes to another level
@entity108 : it hurts to watch @entity18 *graduate* @entity20 playing so well for rivals @entity3
