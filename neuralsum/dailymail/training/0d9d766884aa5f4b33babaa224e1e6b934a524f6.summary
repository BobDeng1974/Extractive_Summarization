by @entity1 reporter published : 11:48 est , 4 december 2013 updated : 14:07 est , 4 december 2013 outraged child advocates are blasting @entity4 's new @entity3 because it includes a fighter jet escort for jolly old @entity6			1
some say the new online portrait could give kids the wrong impression about @entity6 - associating him with the military and violence			2
but @entity15 officials argue the @entity4 is a military organization - its purpose is to track incursions of the airspace over the @entity20 and @entity21 - and the inclusion of fighter jets into @entity6 's new digital flight across the world is a nod to @entity4 's true mission			1
‘ it 's a backdoor way of marketing to kids when they are not supposed to be recruiting until they are much older , ’ he said			2

' @entity59 , a professor of public health at the @entity61 , told the newspaper : ' if the military wants to keep its ranks stocked , it needs to appeal to children			0
the military knows it ca n’t appeal to adults to volunteer			0
it is like the ad industry			0
' the program sponsored by @entity4 drew 22.3 million visitors last year and generated 114,000 phone calls from around the @entity20 the 2013 video shows @entity6 – call sign ‘ @entity77 ’ - guided by @entity79 , zooming over snowy mountains with two warplanes on either side			1
‘ it 's still cutesy since it 's for kids , but we do n't want people to lose sight of our true mission , ’ @entity80 , navy captain and @entity4 spokesman , told the @entity83			1
in the controversial @entity4 video released this week , an intelligence officer in the operation center says that ‘ intel can confirm that @entity93 and the @entity94 will not be a threat			1
’ ground forces report that all rooftops have been checked to make sure @entity6 and his reindeer can land safely			0
and if someone tries to launch a cyber-attack on @entity6 ’s navigation system , the ‘ anti-grinch - viral ’ has been put in place to monitor for threats			1
the three - and - a - half - minute clip mixing live action and computer animation concludes with a view of a fighter jet cockpit as a pilot declares that he will prevent @entity6 from straying into restricted air space and protect him from unspecified threats			1
@entity113 : a video on the @entity4 website shows military personnel seemingly preparing for a test flight by @entity6 in the @entity4 video showcasing the preparations for @entity6 's flight , @entity118 has been assigned the call sign ' @entity77 ' @entity80 said @entity4 videos had linked fighter escorts and @entity6 since the 1960s , but 2013 marked the first time the planes had been shown in an animated version			1
a video on the @entity4 website shows military personnel seemingly preparing for a test flight by @entity6 , also known as ‘ @entity77			1

’ the addition of the fighter jets is not the only new twist for @entity4 ’s holiday - themed mission this year			1
the agency has teamed up with @entity143 to redesign its @entity145 website , which went live sunday			2
the high - tech website comes with all the latest bells and whistles , including a 3d globe , a holiday countdown and interactive games			2
the redesign team has added a touch function to the site , allowing smartphone users to pinch and zoom in on @entity6 ’s destinations , according to @entity143			0
@entity157 will be offering its competing @entity158 , which made its debut last year			0
it all started in 1955 when a local media advertisement directed children to call @entity6 direct – only the number was misprinted			0
instead of reaching @entity6 , the phone rang through to the crew commander on duty at the @entity166			0
thus began the tradition which @entity4 carried on since it was created in 1958			2
command center : volunteers seen in this 2012 photo taking phone calls from children asking where @entity6 is and when he will deliver presents to their house rival : @entity157 used their own map system last year independently of @entity4 to track @entity6			1
