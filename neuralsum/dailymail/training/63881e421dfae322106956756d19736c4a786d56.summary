by @entity0 working overtime ? it might not do your career any favours you might think that treating the office as your second home and working excessively hard can only bring you success and promotion			0
however a new study carried out at the @entity11 in @entity12 has shown that workaholism is detrimental not only to employees ’ health , but also their performance in the office			1
in addition to increasing psychological and physical strain , compulsive overworking decreased job performance and increased absence from work due to illness			1
a ‘ workaholic ’ is defined as someone who both works obsessively and compulsively , with both characteristics persistently present at a high level			0
working overtime and taking work home , as well as dedicating too much thought space and emotional attachment to their job means workaholics have too little time for ‘ recovery ’			0
the efforts you put in at work must be followed by an adequate period of physical and mental ‘ unwinding ’ or ‘ recovery ’ to ensure optimum health and functionality			0
the team at the @entity11 looked at 322 workers in a private company over 15 months			2
each worker completed self - report questionnaires to establish to what degree they had workaholic traits , and their psychophysic strain was measured by a physician ’s report , an appraisal of their performance by a supervisor , and the number of days taken off for sickness			1
as well as increasing psychological and physical strain , compulsive over working decreased job performance and increased absence from work due to illness @entity68 was associated with psychophysic strain , which was in turn associated with poor performance and increased sickness absences , and was also found to be independently associated with absences from work			1
so though a workaholic may work harder and for more hours , the strain they put themselves under will reduce their performance - subsequently seeing them take more days off as a result .			2

study by @entity11 in @entity12 followed workers over 15 years
found workaholism linked to increased psychophysic strain
this strain was linked to reduced job performance
workaholism also *slink* to increased absence from work due to illness
