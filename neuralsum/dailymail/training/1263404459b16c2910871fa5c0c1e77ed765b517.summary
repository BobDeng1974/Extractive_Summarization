by @entity0 @entity1 has agreed to pay @entity2 to ensure its video streams receive priority over the @entity6 network			0
it comes amid growing concern over @entity6 plans to throttle high - bandwidth services such as @entity1 - and claims from @entity1 boss @entity10 that payments are an ' arbitrary tax '			1
the deal comes just weeks after a similar agreement with @entity15 was revealed			1
companies such as @entity1 , @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19 have been looking to compete with traditional tv programming to increase revenue			0
@entity1 recently agreed to pay @entity2 to ensure its video streams receive priority over the @entity6 network @entity1 most recent speed chart , showing a big increase for @entity15 since a deal was signed - and @entity2 languishing in the middle of the table			1
according to a brief statement , from @entity1 , ' we have reached an interconnect arrangement with @entity2 that we hope will improve performance for our joint customers over the coming months			1
' the deal has already paid off for @entity15 subscribers , and recent figures show @entity1 's videos are streaming through @entity15 's internet service at their highest speeds in 17 months			1
however , the deal also intesifies debate over whether the @entity42 should draw up new rules to ensure that all online content providers are treated the same by @entity38 service providers			0
the equal - treatment doctrine , known as net neutrality , has become a thornier topic since january when a federal appeals court overturned the @entity42 's regulations on the issue			0
@entity10 recently called interconnection fees an ' arbitrary tax ' that the company would pay in certain cases to protect its customers ' experience			1
' instead , they must provide sufficient access to their network without charge , ' @entity10 wrote on the @entity1 blog			1
he said free interconnection was key to ensuring ' net neutrality , ' which requires that internet providers treat data from different content companies equally			2
@entity70 with @entity71 as @entity73 representative @entity72 : the sucess of @entity1 has caused a huge increase in the amount of traffic the service generates he accused firms of bullying			0
' some big @entity6 are extracting a toll because they can - they effectively control access to millions of consumers and are willing to sacrifice the interests of their own customers to press @entity1 and others to pay , ' he wrote in the blog post			0
' though they have the scale and power to do this , they should realize it is in their long term interest to back strong net neutrality			0
net neutrality is also drawing more attention as @entity15 tries to gain approval of its proposed $ 45 billion purchase of @entity100 , another large @entity6			0
as the world 's largest internet video subscription service , @entity1 has long supported net neutrality as a way to prevent online service providers from giving better treatment to websites willing to pay additional fees for the privilege			2
@entity1 previously had been paying third - party vendors such as @entity110 and @entity111 to deliver its content to @entity15			2
some analysts suspect @entity1 may be saving money by paying @entity6 directly instead of the vendors , but the specifics remain unknown as part of a confidentiality agreement			0
net prejudice ? critics say the deal struck between the two companies is unfair to other internet providers and the people who use them higher streaming speeds allow users to watch higher - quality video and translate to fewer interruptions in the picture			1
that 's good news for @entity1 because higher - quality video should please many of its 33 million @entity73 subscribers who pay $ 8 per month for the company 's video streaming service			2
@entity15 and other broadband providers contend @entity1 's growing popularity should require the company to shoulder some of the financial burden for delivering its video			1
in evening hours , @entity1 's @entity73 subscribers generate nearly a third of the @entity38 's downloading activity , according to the research firm			2
by early this year , @entity15 's streaming of @entity1 video had slowed to the point that @entity10 felt compelled to work more directly with @entity15 to retain his company 's subscribers			1
the better access that @entity1 is getting from @entity15 is known as ‘ interconnection , ’ a term referring to digital content 's journey to an @entity6 's gates			0
that path technically is n't covered by the current definition of net neutrality , which refers to how service providers treat digital content once it 's inside the gates			0
@entity15 has promised to honor the previous rules governing net neutrality through 2018			0
@entity166 's @entity165 video site and many other websites were paying interconnection fees to @entity15 before @entity1 struck its own deal with the carrier .			1
