by @entity0 for @entity1 @entity2 , the last surviving crew member of the @entity4 disaster , has died aged 92 it was a life that could quite literally have gone up in flames - @entity2 was just a 14 - year - old cabin boy when he was aboard the @entity8 airship @entity4 , as it became engulfed by fire and crashed in @entity11 77 years ago			1
his sharp young mind and a huge stroke of luck meant he spent those last 77 years alive , and not as a mere statistic in the tragedy which marked the end of the airship era			1
as the huge , hydrogen - filled @entity19 burst into flames , mr @entity2 happened to be cleaning up in the officers ' mess , where a huge tank of water above him burst and protected him from the blaze			1
he was able to jump out of the ship as it fell devastatingly to the ground , and fled the wreckage to escape without so much as a scratch			2
he had the nous to run into the wind - if he had gone the other way he would have been swallowed up by the flames and become the 37th life claimed by the tragedy			2
mr @entity2 certainly made the most of his lucky escape - he was 92 when he died from heart failure earlier this month - and was the last surviving crew member			1
he returned to @entity8 after the crash , and served as an aircraft technician during @entity41 he went on to coach roller skating and ice skating later in life , and was never afraid to tell people about his experience , said @entity47 , president of the @entity48 , who last met him at a 2004 event commemorating the disaster			2
the tragedy is particularly iconic in the history of aircraft , as photographers and film crews were able to capture the devastation as it unfolded			0
today , photographs not only show us the enormity of the event , but also how fortunate mr @entity2 and the airship 's 61 other on - board survivors really were			1
' his older brother worked at a fancy hotel in @entity79 where the passengers and the captain stayed overnight before the airship took off early in the morning , ' he said			1
' one of the captains said they were looking for a cabin boy and [ his brother ] heard about it			1
' he added : ' @entity2 was most fortunate because he was in the officers ' mess cleaning up			2
above him was a large tank of water that burst open and drenched him , which protected him a bit from the flames and the heat			0
' he was able to jump out of a cloth supply hatch onto the ground below and made the wise decision to run into the wind			2
' he did n't make the mistake of going in the other direction or the flames would have caught him , ' mr @entity75 said			0
mr @entity75 , quoting mr @entity2 's widow @entity102 , confirmed that he died in his home town of @entity79 on august 13			1
there are believed to be three more survivors from the disaster still alive today - two passengers named @entity108 and @entity109 , who were both children - and @entity110 , a member of the ground crew that was waiting to moor the ship			1
the @entity4 disaster happened on thursday , may 6 , 1937 , when the @entity8 passenger airship @entity114 caught fire and crashed at @entity117 in @entity11 as it tried to dock with its mooring mast			1
there were 97 people on board the ship , made up of 36 passengers and 61 members of crew			1
of those , 35 died - 13 passengers and 22 crew - along with one worker on the ground			1
in total , 36 people were killed , though it could have been more , as the flight was only half booked			1
the huge airship - as long as three football fields and 15 stories tall - was considered the most luxurious means to cross the @entity137 at the time			0
its loss - widely attributed to static electricity that ignited leaking hydrogen - was a heavy blow to the image of a resurgent @entity8 that the @entity145 wanted to project to the world			0
the disaster was hugely covered in the media , as photographers and video artists were able to capture it from the ground - this helped make it one of the most iconic and highest profile aircraft crashes in history			2
the airship had left from @entity79 three days earlier on may 3 , for what was supposed to the the first of 10 trips between @entity161 and @entity162			2
as it came to land it was hours behind schedule because of stormy weather			0
the captain diverted it towards @entity170 , which drew huge crowds of people who came to catch a glimpse of the vast ship			0
the craft came in to land at around 7.30pm , and witnesses recounted seeing what looked like a gas leak , and also what may have been static electricity			0
it is disputed where the fire started , but those on board heard an explosion , before the ship burst into flames			0
the back of the ship broke and the tail end crashed into the ground			0
this caused fire to fly through the nose and kill nine members of the crew			0
in total , the accident is believed to have lasted between just 32 and 37 second , with experts analysing that the fire spread at a rate of around 15m/s			0
there are other theories relating to how the fire came to start			0
these range from the idea that a gunshot was actually to blame , that it was struck by lightning or that the engine failed , though the static theory is considered to be the most likely .			0
