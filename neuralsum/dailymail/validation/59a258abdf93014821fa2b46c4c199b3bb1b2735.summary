a man who has fathered 34 children with 17 different women has landed his own reality series , which is due to start airing on @entity5 's own network in september			1
@entity6 , from @entity7 , previously featured in an episode of @entity9 : fix my life , another of the channel 's hit shows , which sees spiritual life coach @entity15 , trying to help different people all struggling with various aspects of their lives			1
the untitled new series will follow the seemingly irresponsible father as he tries to establish new connections with his children , who are thought to be aged between three and 27 , and their mothers			0
any fans of @entity40 's show could n't fail to recognize @entity6 - who was one of the series ' most controversial characters			1
when the video producer appeared on the show in september last year , he was lambasted by the life coach for failing to undergo a vasectomy - despite fathering so many children , who had , as of october 2014 , already made him a grandfather three times			2
' so let me ask you this question , @entity6 , ' @entity40 said during the episode			1
at any point , did it dawn on you this is too much ? ' the straight - talking life coach also forced @entity6 to sit down with four of his children and explain to them why he had ' dropped them ' and failed to live up to his responsibilities as a father			1
' i would like to confess that i absolutely did not love or care for myself at all , ' he explained to the group of four			0
tough love : the straight - talking life coach demanded that @entity6 own up to the mistakes that he has made , both as a father and as a man no trust : four of @entity6 's children appeared on the show ( pictured ) when their father tried to offer up an explanation for his behavior and apologize for not being there for them ' i have not honored your mothers as women the way that i should have			1
i would never say willingly , but i absolutely fell short on my responsibilities to you as a provider , at times			0
' and the biggest thing that i would like to confess is that i absolutely did not live up to be the true man that i am and the father that you really have			0
i am responsible for the reason why each and every one of you absolutely do n't know me			0
' but despite @entity6 insisting that his sentiments were completely and utterly heart - felt , it seemed his sentiments came too little too late for some of his children			2
' i just want you to know that i really do n't care anymore , ' one of his daughters told him			0
' i 'm just not buying it			0
' ironically , despite admitting to fathering numerous children , @entity6 insisted to @entity40 throughout the show that he did use condoms - and even added that , had he chosen not to use contraception , he ' probably would have had 200 kids '			2
indeed , @entity6 went as far as to say that he was ' happy ' about the number of children that he had fathered , remarking that he had n't chosen to get a vasectomy because he ' did n't want one ' .			2
