by @entity0 published : 19:46 est , 27 august 2013 updated : 19:46 est , 27 august 2013 getting married : @entity1 , 60 , will be giving away his actress daughter @entity2 , pictured , as planned this weekend as the founder of one of @entity7 ’s most exclusive estate agents , regularly selling homes worth in excess of £ 20 million , burly @entity1 has always been a force to be reckoned with in the property market			1
but despite being fit and a keen tennis player , 6ft @entity1 was no match for the four thugs who followed him by car as he drove his mercedes near @entity16 at the weekend - and then subjected him to a vicious attack the moment he had parked			1
three of the men launched themselves at him as he clambered out of his car - he was on his way to meet a friend - grabbing him from behind , punching and throttling him and covering his eyes			1
they relieved him of his watch and his keys			1
the fourth remained at the wheel of their getaway car			1
‘ it was an expensive watch , and of sentimental value			1
i will be wearing an @entity32 from now on , ’ says @entity1 , 60 , who will be giving away his actress daughter @entity2 , pictured , as planned this weekend			1
typically , the businessman was bloodied but unbowed			1
@entity1 refused hospital treatment despite being left shaken by the incident and suffering a bruised larynx			1
he was back at work 48 hours later			2
‘ they must have been following me , ’ he tells me			2
‘ i parked and they stopped their car in the @entity42			1
a porter at a block of flats nearby saw what happened and managed to get their number plate , but the police have n’t traced them			2
’ @entity1 , a friend of @entity52 billionaire @entity51 , started his @entity54 company in @entity55 35 years ago - he is currently marketing a luxurious ten - bedroom mansion in @entity57 for £ 25 million			1
and he is refusing to let the mugging affect his plans for his daughter ’s wedding			1
beautiful @entity2 , 25 - @entity1 ’s child by his first wife , @entity62 - is marrying her boyfriend of the past two years , @entity66 - born hedge fund entrepreneur @entity65			1
in a bizarre coincidence , @entity2 ’s acting career has often involved her playing roles almost as scary as that of her father ’s real - life incident			1
she is co-starring as a werewolf in the forthcoming horror flick @entity75 and has also been filming a pilot for a @entity78 tv series in which she plays a femme fatale thief			2
just weeks after i revealed that @entity82 mp @entity81 had split from her @entity85 @entity84 boyfriend @entity83 , i gather she is not short of offers from other men			1
she was in a bar over the weekend - alone , alas , and reading a book - when she was approached by what she describes as a ‘ drunk guy harassing me ’			1
she tweeted friends asking whether she should deflect him by pretending to be a lesbian , swearing or leaving			2
her colleague , police minister @entity95 , advised her to simply tell the truth			2
‘ tell him you ’re an mp , ’ he suggested			2
it did the trick , but all the more reason for ms @entity81 to find herself a new chap , perhaps			2
back to school : mother - of - four @entity105 already has a qualification in trauma counselling @entity108 broadcaster @entity105 made the news herself when she refused to join the @entity111 exodus to @entity112 and left the breakfast programme ’s sofa			2
now she is raising eyebrows again with a decision to combine her career with reading for a masters degree in psychology at the @entity121			2
the mother - of - four , 48 , who turned down @entity124 after consulting her children , already has a qualification in trauma counselling			2
she became interested in the area after reporting on the @entity130 tsunami in 2004 and the @entity132 earthquake in 2008			2
‘ @entity105 has n’t done any exams for nearly 30 years , but her sons have been helping out with revision tips , ’ says a friend			1
@entity105 is leaving @entity138 ’s saturday live show to concentrate on her studies			0
‘ this is an exciting new chapter for @entity105			0
she will be spreading her wings and taking on a number of new tv projects in the next year , ’ adds the friend			0
in the world of celebrity crimper @entity146 , there is no such thing as a bad hair day - fixing the follicles of stars and the super-rich is what he charges £ 500 a snip for			0
but @entity55 stylist @entity146 , whose clients have included @entity155 and @entity156 , is experiencing problems with his own lush tresses			0
@entity146 , 55 , who shares his life with fashionista @entity160 , has bought an @entity162 scooter to nip between home in @entity57 and the @entity164			0
but he complains that wearing a crash helmet on the five - mile journey flattens down his famously flowing hair , making it lose its ‘ bounce ’			0
better than losing your bonce , @entity146			0
plan : @entity174 diggers tycoon sir @entity176 's wife @entity175 is about to open a restaurant near their @entity179 home newly elevated to the @entity181 , @entity82 donor and wildly rich @entity174 diggers tycoon sir @entity176 will be able to celebrate his investiture in style — at the restaurant his wife is about to open near their @entity179 home			0
@entity175 has spent more than a year overseeing the renovation of the former @entity191 pub in nearby @entity192 , hanging its name to @entity194			0
although she is not the licensee , @entity195 has ensured some uniquely personal touches — much of the produce will come from her @entity200 estate and for five years the chef @entity201 was her family ’s private cook			1
@entity201 previously worked for @entity204 at the @entity206 - starred @entity205 and friends say @entity208 hopes he might be able to win her a star , too			0
the hostelry opens next week and will no doubt attract custom from the so - called @entity213 set , which includes @entity214 , @entity215 and troubled ex-newspaper boss @entity216			0
it is an intriguing development for @entity195			0
her @entity219 brand has endured challenging trading conditions			0
latest figures from @entity223 show the business made a £ 4.3 million loss at the end of 2011 , and the @entity228 state in the accounts that ‘ they will provide financial support to enable the company to continue as a going concern ’			0
chanteuse @entity234 may have endured 15 painful hours having giant roses tattooed on her bottom , but she is not the only one for a penchant for covering her body with artwork			0
a fan of classical singing group @entity243 has had her entire torso and both arms inked with the band ’s lyrics , along with intricate pictures illustrating each tune			0
‘ a mother and daughter from @entity255 came to one of our gigs a couple of weeks ago and the daughter proudly showed us these tattoos , ’ says tenor and former @entity252 chorister @entity250 , 30			1
‘ they were multi-coloured and all over her upper body , back and arms and she ’s considering having our faces done next apparently			0
it was quite a surprise			0
‘ the lengths that some fans go to is really rather extraordinary			0
’ @entity273 , surely , that talk of prince @entity270 and @entity272 remarrying is just that : @entity274 has no plans to bring their waxworks back			0
the couple were removed from the attraction years ago			1
not that the @entity279 have completely vanished			0
‘ we store in our archives all the moulds , heads and hands of every figure we ’ve ever made , ’ says head of marketing @entity281			0
‘ we have re-cast and updated figures in the past - to date we ’ve created 23 figures of the @entity290			1
at this moment , we do n’t have plans to create new figures of the @entity293 and @entity272			1
