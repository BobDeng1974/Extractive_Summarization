fresh light has been shone on the mystery of @entity2 after an @entity4 librarian found the landmass that was n't on a 1908 map			1
the mysterious island sparked worldwide interest last month when a team of researchers who went on a hunt for it discovered nothing but waves when they arrived			2
a range of maps and charts , including @entity19 and others both historical and modern , showed in the @entity21 between @entity4 and @entity22			1
earliest mention ? @entity2 is shown in this 1908 admiralty chart in @entity25 's collection as a substantially sized island in the middle of the @entity21 to the east of the @entity29 however , its existence would have been a geological oddity since it apparently sat in a region of deep waters			1
in an effort to track down its earliest appearance on a map librarian @entity37 scoured @entity25 's large collection of maps and charts of the @entity44 , the museum 's blog reported			1
after searching through maps dating as far back as the 1700s , mr @entity37 finally tracked down @entity2 's earliest appearance in the collection to a 1908 admiralty chart			1
@entity50 , a writer in the museum 's exhibitions team , said the chart indicates that the island was discovered by a ship called the @entity56 in 1876			1
but , he adds , there is a generic note attached to the map which warns : ' caution is necessary while navigating among the low lying islands of the @entity44			0
' the general details have been collated from the voyages of various navigators extending over a long series of years			0
the relative position of many dangers may therefore not be exactly given			0
' mr @entity37 told the @entity68 : ' it has the same shape as [ on ] @entity19 , but it 's dotted			0
it could have been dotted because it was an unidentified hazard			0
' phantom island : @entity2 as it appears on @entity74 's satellite maps			1
it sparked worldwide interest last month when a team of researchers who went on a hunt for it discovered nothing but waves when they arrived a reader the @entity25 's blog posted a comment on their story saying the @entity56 was a 140 ton whaling ship captained by a @entity89			1
the post , which cited an article in the @entity92 from april 1877 , went on : ' captain @entity89 reported that he left the river [ @entity94 ] on the 15th april 1876 and proceeded to @entity95 where whales were seen once during a gale of wind			0
' shortly after this the vessel sprang a leak , which kept on increasing and a course was shaped for the @entity104 group , where an anchorage being obtained the leak was partially stopped			0
' while there an anchor and chain were lost in a heavy gale , and the brig then went to @entity112 anchoring in @entity113 , @entity114 [ @entity115 ]			0
' the commenter added : ' this gives the velocity in the area of ‘ @entity2 ’ in 1876			2
' a reference to the island is also found in the 1879 edition of the @entity4 directory produced by the admiralty hydrographic department , the @entity68 reported			1
' in 1876 , the master of the whaler @entity56 reported that while cruising on the eastern side of the @entity104 and @entity128 reefs , he observed heavy breakers in lat 19 ' 50 ' s long , 158 ' 50 ' e , ' it said			2
' the master of @entity56 also reported a line of sandy islets as extending about @entity136 along the meridian of 159 ' 57 e , between lat 19 ' 7 @entity139 ' look for yourself : this map embedded from @entity74 maps shows the location of the phantom island interest was sparked in @entity2 after a group of researchers from the @entity148 went on a voyage in search of it and found it did not exist			1
as well as appearing on @entity152 , the @entity153 appeared to identify the phantom landmass as @entity155 , and it was also shown weather maps used by the @entity157 , the maritime research vessel which the team travelled on			2
mission : dr @entity161 , of the @entity148 , who was part of the team who went in search of @entity2 last month but when the ship , which was tasked with identifying fragments of the @entity4 continental crust submerged in the @entity21 , steamed to where it was supposed to be there was nothing there			1
the island had supposedly sat in an area of very deep sea , making its existence something of a geological oddity that researchers wanted to investigate			0
' we wanted to check it out because the navigation charts on board the ship showed a water depth of 1,400 metres ( 4,620 feet ) in that area - very deep , ' said dr @entity161 , of the @entity148 , after the 25 - day voyage			2
' it 's on @entity19 and other maps so we went to check and there was no island			2
' the latest development in the @entity2 mystery seems to put paid to the theory , previously reported by @entity197 , that the landmass appeared as the result of an error in digitising satellite maps			1
however , it does not answer the question of why it was n't removed from maps after amateur radio enthusiasts discovered it was n't actually there in 2000			0
indeed , @entity209 , one ham radio enthusiast , told @entity197 that he had heard of a number of rumours of so - called ' @entity213 ' that turned out to be phantoms			0
he was part of an expedition disproving the existence of another such land mass with the same name near the @entity112 , he said			0
the @entity21 's @entity2 now appears to have been removed from @entity152 , however it still appears on the service 's @entity221 and on @entity19 .			0

@entity2 appeared on a range of maps and satellite pictures but @entity4 team that went in hunt of it found nothing there
@entity25 librarian scours collection of maps and charts dating back to 1700s and finds first mention on 1908 admiralty chart
chart says island was discovered by whaling ship @entity56 in 1876 , but warns its position ' may not be exactly given '
