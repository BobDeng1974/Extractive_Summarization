by @entity1 correspondent published : 03:18 est , 2 april 2013 updated : 19:50 est , 2 april 2013 for a man with such a daunting in - tray as new boss of the @entity6 , it was a bizarre performance to say the least			1
as he took over as director general yesterday , @entity7 was about to be confronted by a report into @entity11 ’s sex abuse , a review into bullying and harassment within the corporation , on - going industrial disputes and tough financial cuts			2
the 62 - year - old nevertheless decided it was the perfect time to fool around for the cameras			0
as photographers called out his name , requesting him to stand in different positions , he dithered over which direction to go and ended up apparently playing the clown – almost appearing to dance			0
during his tour of tv news studios , the man charged with mending the corporation ’s battered reputation denied the @entity6 was a ‘ left of centre ’ organisation and said audience trust in the broadcaster was ‘ climbing back ’			1
a former chief executive of the @entity22 , who began as a @entity6 trainee 40 years ago , @entity7 said he had known ‘ absolutely nothing ’ about @entity11 ’s activities when he used to work at the corporation , in its news division			1
he singled out current shows for praise including @entity56 , @entity54 and the @entity55			0
eccentric entrance : clearly the @entity6 's new director general is eager to start his new job this way , colleagues ! @entity7 introduces himself as people enter the @entity6 's huge @entity64 offices the new @entity58 sent an encouraging email to staff , telling them he believed the @entity6 's best days ' lay ahead ' all smiles : @entity7 has a mammoth task ahead of him one of his first actions in the £ 450,000 - a - year job yesterday was to send an email to all of the corporation ’s staff in which he suggested ‘ the @entity6 ’s best days lie ahead of us ’			1
his arrival comes after predecessor @entity79 lasted just 54 days in the role , after he became embroiled first in the @entity11 controversy and then the bungled @entity83 report into @entity84 , which wrongly linked the peer to historic sex abuse claims			1
the @entity89 crisis was hugely damaging for the corporation ’s reputation and , alongside on - going cuts , has left a legacy of low morale at the broadcaster			1
yesterday the new director general warned staff he took a ‘ very dim view ’ of anything that got in the way of team - work and was ‘ intolerant ’ of anything that stopped it making ‘ great programmes ’			0
while his response about team - work came to a question about the bullying and harassment review , it is understood he has also told top bosses at the broadcaster they must talk to each other			0
@entity7 will now be faced with the difficult task of leading the @entity6 as it seeks to restore its reputation one of the key criticisms about the @entity6 during the @entity89 crisis was that executives worked in ‘ silos ’ and did not properly inform each other of what was going on at the corporation			1
vile @entity11 prompted a huge scandal at the @entity6 @entity7 was challenged by @entity124 presenter @entity123 about the recent appointment of former @entity127 minister @entity126 to a senior role at the @entity6 and asked if the corporation was a ‘ left of centre ’ organisation			1
the director general said ‘ no ’ before saying he had brought in mr @entity126 , who used to work at the broadcaster , to ‘ shape the strategy for the @entity6 going forward ’			2
when he was asked if the @entity6 needed more money when charter renewal comes in a few years , the @entity6 boss added : ‘ at the moment i do n’t know the answer to that			0
‘ what i do know is that it would be a mistake to try to reopen any negotiations about money at the moment , because of the economy and people out there are going through some very , very hard times			0
’ he said that the @entity89 crisis had been ‘ a tough time for the @entity6 ’ but ‘ an even tougher time for those directly affected by what happened ’			2
@entity7 also declared himself a fan of a wide range of @entity6 shows , claiming he had enjoyed seeing @entity159 get picked to go through in saturday ’s opening episode of @entity54 and praised the ‘ wonderful sharp form ’ of @entity56			2
the @entity6 's image has been tarnished by a string of incidents in the past year			1
last week , the @entity6 was hit by unions protesting at the @entity167 ( @entity168 ) programme which will lead to 2,000 job losses at the corporation			2
a strike by journalists and technical staff in a row over jobs , workload and claims of bullying caused well - known shows to be dropped on @entity180			0
the strike , from 12pm until midnight , led to the cancellation of @entity6 2 's @entity83 , @entity183 's @entity184			1
since october , more than 850 @entity6 employees have come forward to raise concerns about bullying and sexual harassment at the corporation			0
the staff members have contacted private consultants brought in by the @entity6 as part of an internal inquiry set up in the wake of the @entity11 scandal			2
the @entity196 , overseen by human rights lawyer @entity197 , was launched last year following a wave of damaging claims from female presenters who said they were routinely groped while working for the @entity6			0
in december 2011 the @entity6 dropped a @entity83 investigation into @entity11 's years of sex attacks			1
last year it was revealed that hundreds of people came forward alleging that they had been abused by @entity11 and other high - profile figures			0
the @entity206 , an inquiry into how the @entity6 handled the @entity89 affair , reveals better leadership could have prevented ' chaos and confusion ' at @entity6 over the dj scandal scandal			1
another low - key entrance : @entity214 , the @entity6 creative director , seen arriving at @entity29 , certainly knows how to catch the eye on his blue bicycle			0

@entity7 charged with repairing @entity6 's battered reputation
says he is ' proud and excited ' to lead the scandal - hit broadcaster
*replaces* @entity79 who *resigned* after @entity89 and @entity83 furore
larked about in front of cameras on his first day
