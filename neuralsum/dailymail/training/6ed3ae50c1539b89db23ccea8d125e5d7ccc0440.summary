@entity0 , @entity1 , has long been one of the most dangerous places in @entity4 , but recent police cuts combined with the highest unemployment rate in @entity1 have made the city even deadlier			1
this year there have been 39 murders in the city of 77,000 -- on pace to break the all - time record set in 1995			1
in 2011 , the murder rate was ten times than that of @entity16 and 30 percent higher than @entity17 , @entity18 , the most dangerous large city in the nation			1

they 're just out here to pick up the bodies ' abject poverty : the unemployment rate in @entity0 skyrocketed from less than 9 percent to more than 20 percent during the recession			1

most of the murder victims this year were male , with the youngest a 16 - year - old boy and the eldest a 42 - year - old woman			1

depressing : @entity0 in @entity1 is now a sad shadow of its former self neighbourhood : people are scarcely seen on the city 's streets which have become the second most dangerous in the @entity4 drop : the population has plummeted by more than 40 per cent from its 1950 level of 120,000 as a result , arrests fell to less than half what they were in 2009 -- when the city looked like it was bringing the crime epidemic under control			1

they 're just out here to pick up the bodies			0
' @entity0 was once a major hub of manufacturing , with large plants from @entity140 and @entity141 employing tens of thousands of workers			0
as those factories left , nothing replaced them and the city fell into ruin			0
devastated : many houses have simply been left to rack and ruin former glories : echoes of a previous time are evident everywhere you go in @entity0 filthy : the stench of sewage permeates the run - down streets in the last decade , crack houses have sprung up amid the boarded - up factories and burned out houses			0
people live in fear of being robbed or shot as addicts roam the streets looking to fund their habit			0

in the 39 murder cases , charges had been filed in 17 , according to police			2
there were 103 shootings in total from january to july this year			2
@entity0 has long been the poorest city in @entity1 , but the recession has made things worse -- and the situation is not improving			2

in may , it stood at 18 percent , leaving thousands of young men out of work and with few alternatives			0

revered @entity199 of @entity200 told @entity201 : ' right now , we are going to funerals of a lot of victims of the violence in the city , but we would love to bring about an atmosphere where we do n't have to attend funerals			0
' deserted : @entity0 has no movie theatres and the only supermarket is located outside of the city , away from the crime - ridden streets discarded : empty bottles sit as a shrine on the location where a citizen was murdered back in the day : @entity0 , @entity1 , was a hub of manufacturing in industry for many decades style : heavyweight champion of the world @entity225 and his wife are snapped strolling down @entity0 's @entity227 during one of @entity225 's leisure days in 1951 decay : @entity0 , located opposite @entity231 , is a shadow of the city it used to be			2
