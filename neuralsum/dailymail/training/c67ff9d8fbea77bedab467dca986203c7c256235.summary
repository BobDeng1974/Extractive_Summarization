' i do n't love him			0
i pity him and i feel sorry for him , ' @entity7 said in an interview with @entity10 's @entity9 that will air in full monday evening			1
the timeline of their relationship remains murky , because while the 79 - year - old said that she and her 81 - year - old husband have only been estranged for a year , she has been thinking about divorce for much longer			1
' in fact , i have here - i just filed - i was going to file the petition			0
i signed the petition for a divorce			2
and it came to almost being filed			0
and then , my financial advisor and my attorney said to me , " not now			0
" ' she went on to say that the formal act of divorce has a lot to do with ' financial arrangements ' but added that ' eventually , i 'm going to do it '			1
@entity1 's net worth is estimated to be somewhere around $ 1.9billion and he bought the @entity2 in 1981 but now @entity7 legally owns half of the team			1
' i 've been with the team for 33 years , through the good times and the bad times			2
and it 's my passion and i love it , ' she said			0

@entity7 is fighting for half of those gifts			2
in spite of their troubled 60 - year marriage , @entity7 maintains that she does not believe @entity1 is racist			1
' i - in my opinion , i think he - it 's the onset of dementia , ' she said during a sunday interview with @entity67			0

' and he says , ' hmm			0
i do n't remember it , ' she told @entity9			2
' that 's when i thought he had dementia			0
the interview came almost two weeks after @entity80 commissioner @entity79 announced he had banned @entity1 from the league for life after recordings of his racist ranting at presumed mistress @entity85 were made public			1
silver urged owners to move quickly to force @entity1 to sell the team , and the league has since even installed a former @entity92 executive to oversee the team 's operations - but it was soon revealed that @entity20 legally owns half of the team			1
and she has repeatedly said she will fight to retain her stake , adding an unwanted twist to the @entity80 's plan to force new ownership on the franchise			1
' i will fight that decision , ' she said , adding the team is her ' passion , ' and ' a legacy to my family			2
' i 've been with the team for 33 years , through the good times and the bad times , ' said @entity7			1
@entity7 also asked if there had even been an instance where an owner was forced to sell his stake in a sports franchise after his wife had spoken inappropriately			1
she then suggested she ' would love him to ' transfer his ownership stake in the team to her , but said she had n't yet broached the possibility with him or his attorneys			1
@entity119 : @entity7 ( left ) has admitted she will ' eventually ' divorce disgraced husband @entity1 ( right ) her steadfast refusal to part with her stake in the @entity2 was first reported earlier this week when her attorney @entity124 , said his client ' will not agree to a forced or involuntary seizure of her interest			1
' as her lawyers , we will fight vigorously to defend her property rights , ' he said			2
@entity124 said mrs. @entity20 has no interest in managing the @entity2 and wants a new investor group to come in with a professional management team			2
@entity124 also said that @entity7 has been separated from her husband for the last year and is considering divorce			1
there is no record of legal separation documents being filed , though @entity124 said the couple is living apart			0
last month , @entity80 commissioner @entity79 banned @entity1 from the @entity80 for life and urged league owners to force him to sell the team			1
the move came after a recording surfaced in which @entity1 made racist comments , telling friend @entity50 that he did n't want her to bring black people to @entity2 games			1
at a news conference announcing the bann , @entity79 said no decision had been made regarding whether she or any other @entity1 family member will be allowed to retain an ownership position			1
@entity124 said he spoke with @entity80 officials thursday morning but declined to elaborate			0
he said his client has been working cooperatively with @entity79 and his staff and supported his announcement seeking a new chief executive officer for the team and the @entity80 's decision to place longtime team president @entity161 on leave			2
@entity80 spokesman @entity164 said the league would n't comment on its discussions			0

' the happy couple : @entity2 owner @entity1 , left , and his wife @entity187 watch during the second half in game 3 of a the 2012 @entity191 semifinals against the @entity192 in @entity193 @entity7 and @entity1 faced allegations that they discriminated against tenants based on race in @entity193 according to a lawsuit filed by @entity179 @entity198 in 2006			1
the @entity171 , who at the time owned and managed about 119 apartment buildings or 5,000 apartments throughout @entity203 , agreed to settle the suit for $ 2.725 million			0
the settlement also included two suits filed by former tenants at one of the properties , including an @entity211 - @entity179 family and an interracial married couple with biracial children , who alleged the @entity171 demolished their private yards among other actions because of their race , according to the @entity198			0

' she does n't have a racist bone in her body , ' @entity124 said			0
@entity2 coach @entity228 said thursday at the team 's training facility that ' it would be a very hard situation ' if mrs. @entity20 retained her portion of ownership in the team			2
' i guarantee you every person would n't be on board with that , ' @entity228 said			0
' whether i would or not , i 'm not going to say			0

@entity7 said her husband @entity1 *insisted* he does not remember making the remarks heard on the tapes made public
