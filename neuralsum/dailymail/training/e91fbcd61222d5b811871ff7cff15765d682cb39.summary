the @entity0 are now under investigation by the @entity2 for brutality , after a video surfaced online showing an officer punching an unarmed drug suspect six times in the face and causing the man 's seven - months - pregnant wife to trip and fall on the ground			1
the video obtained by @entity13 is also raising questions about whether the officers involved in the incident violated cell phone search laws , since the witness claims they grabbed his tablet and tried to delete the clip - though they would need a warrant in order to take any of his devices			1
bystander @entity27 was driving to work on august 14 when he saw an incident escalate between a man and a few cops and undercover officers , so he pulled over , took out his tablet and started recording the scene			1
police say the incident started when suspect @entity36 @entity35 noticed plainclothes officers approaching him , and he tried stuffing a white sock full of what was believed to be heroin into his mouth			1
when @entity35 refused to spit up the sock , officer @entity59 punched the suspect six times in the face , his head bouncing off the pavement as he receives the blows			1
' those were the hardest punches i have ever heard , ' @entity27 said			0
' i ’ve seen some people get punched in the ring and on tv and whatnot , but the sound of those resonating , i mean , it was scary			0
i ’ve never heard anything louder than that and i used to cage fight for quite a while and i ’ve never seen punches harder than that			0
' and that 's not all			0
@entity59 proceeded to trip @entity35 ' girlfriend , 25 - year - old @entity85 , when the seven - months - pregnant woman approached the tustle and started yelling at them to stop hurting her boyfriend			1
charged : @entity35 ( left ) and his girlfriend 25 - year - old @entity85 ( right ) face several charges related to the incident , but were no shows at their last court date @entity95 : the video also shows how one of the officers pushed @entity99 when she approached the group , telling them to stop hurting her boyfriend expectant : @entity99 was seven - months - pregnant when she fell to the ground in the incident @entity99 falls to the hard cement , landing on her stomach and face and is seen yelling out in pain , clutching her bump			1
however , the officer has explained his use of force , saying he was trying to retrieve the heroin and also prevent @entity35 from clutching			2
as for @entity35 ' girlfriend , @entity59 says he thought she was going to kick him			0
frasier does n't think she her behavior was threatening : ' she was screaming like , " what are you doing			0
let him go ! let him go ! stop hurting him ! what are you doing ? " she was just concerned for him			2
you could clearly hear that and as she got closer			0
' @entity13 also obtained pictures of @entity35 ' wounds as he was being transported to the hospital			0
the graphic images show his battered head , bloody from being hit on the pavement as well as bruises and cuts all over his head			2
but @entity134 , a former detective hired to analyze the video for @entity35 ' potential criminal case , says he believes the officers went over the top in their use of force			2
illegal search ? witness @entity27 says police officers grabbed his tablet after the incident and then deleted the video			1
he was able to save the clip though , since it was uploaded to his cloud before the device was taken by authorities ' there ’s no obvious and immediate threat of a weapon , ' @entity134 said			2
' i just do n’t see how either swallowing evidence or they ’re worried about him choking is justifying that degree of force			0
i mean , you ’re risking , " we do n’t want you to choke , so we ’re going to fracture your face instead ? " ' the @entity162 is now working with the internal investigators with the @entity0 to see whether the determine whether the incident is a case of police brutality			1
the officers behavior after the incident is also under investigation by the @entity2 , for possible breaches of cellphone search laws			1
@entity27 says in the aftermath of the fight , officers approached him and coaxed him to hand over his tablet , even though he told them that they needed a warrant to do that			2
when they handed the tablet back to him , the video had been deleted , but he was able to salvage the clip since he had already been uploaded to his cloud			1
@entity35 was charges with resisting arrest , and two felony drug charges , while his girlfriend faces charges of obstruction , drugs and child abuse ( there was a child in the car when the arrest happened )			1
neither appeared at their most recent court appearance , and are being asked to turn themselves in			0
@entity0 commander @entity195 responded to the video with a statement saying : ' we are not covering anything up			0
there is no cover up whatsoever , so let me just put that to rest			0
that ’s irresponsible and baseless			0
