a friend and i recently discovered that we were travelling from @entity3 to @entity4 on the same day			1
' which airline ? ' she asked			2
' @entity6 or @entity7 ? ' as it happened , i was flying neither			0
instead , i was flying @entity9 , a budget @entity11 airline that has been muscling in on the competitive @entity4 - @entity3 route with significantly lower prices			1
but her question showed just how heavily the @entity18 airlines ( along with @entity19 and @entity20 ) dominate the market			0
as a @entity23 living in @entity3 , i make the trip frequently , and earn airmiles with both @entity7 and @entity6			1
but i was curious to know whether the heavily - advertised @entity9 flight could compete on comfort as well as cost			1
my booking confirmation indicated that one can pay £ 35 extra per leg for one piece of checked - in baggage , a pre-ordered meal with drinks and seat reservation			2
as a premium passenger however ( prices from £ 560 one - way ) , such ' luxuries ' are included along with a blanket and earbud headphones			2
i was lucky enough to be seated in that @entity52 cabin - seat @entity53 no less - which boasts a spacious 2 - 3 - 2 seat formation			0
and while it can not be compared with the comfort of @entity6 's business class flat beds , it certainly beats its @entity59 in terms of space			0
modern : all of @entity9 's transatlantic flights are on new @entity64 planes which boast large windows with a ' sunglasses mode ' in lieu of blinds and cabin lighting designed to ease the effects of jetlag at 5ft 4in , legroom is rarely an issue for me , but there is no question that there was ample space for the tallest of passengers			1
and while the seats do n't go totally flat , the seat - back went far enough for me to easily nod off , a foot - rest elevating my body into an almost - horizontal position			0
for those in economy , creature comforts can be ordered at an extra cost via the @entity89 touchscreen at each seat - and you can pay by swiping your credit card			0
should you choose not to pre-order a meal , you can order drinks and snacks via the service too			0
while fairly pricey , it 's a system that makes sense to my mind - especially on a red - eye when all i want to do is sleep			2
i 'd rather have a cheaper ticket without drinks , dinner and headphones ( i carry earbuds in my handbag in any case )			0
what 's more , i usually travel hand - luggage only			2
if you plan to booze your way across the @entity112 though , you might find yourself racking up quite a bill			0
the plane itself is impressive too			0
all @entity9 's transatlantic flights ( routes also include @entity119 and @entity120 , @entity121 ) are on 787 @entity122 - they boast huge windows with a ' sunglasses mode ' in lieu of blinds , the cabin lighting is designed to ease the effects of jetlag and even the engines are quieter			1
spacious : the @entity52 cabin boasts a spacious 2 - 3 - 2 seat formation			0
while the seats do n't go flat , the seat - back went far enough for me to easily nod off , a foot - rest elevating my body into an almost - horizontal position stretching out : at 5ft 4in , legroom is rarely an issue for me , but there is no question that there was ample space for the tallest of passengers in the @entity52 seats it is these @entity122 , the company says , that allows it to charge less for tickets			0
the new planes use less fuel and this saving is passed onto the customer			1
while my usual flight experience is an economy one , and i have not experienced @entity9 's economy class , this is not the most direct comparison			1
that said , new planes and pleasant staff make all the difference when crammed into the middle seat of a middle row			0
and though flight prices will always dictate my airline choice , i 'd be tempted to pay extra for @entity9 's @entity52 cabin if it was particularly important that i sleep during the flight			1
it is no wonder that the airline is racking up awards : this year @entity9 was voted the airline offering @entity173 by @entity174 and @entity175 in @entity176 by @entity177			1
creature comforts : blankets and headphones can be ordered at a cost via the @entity89 touchscreen at your seat - and you do n't need cabin crew to make a purchase - the screen has a facility to swipe your credit card time - killer : the touchscreen also boasts an interactive map that even allows you to check out the pilot 's view passenger numbers are on the up , too - @entity9 carried over 2 million passengers in september , an increase of 16 per cent compared to the same month the previous year			1
but @entity9 is not always the cheapest			2
both @entity6 and @entity7 undercut its prices when i was booking my @entity203 flight home last week - you 'll save if you plan your trip in advance , but not if it is last minute			2
additionally , it does not fly every day - just tuesdays , thursdays and saturdays - which can be quite limiting if your dates are fixed			0
but with departures from @entity33 doubling next year to six flights per week , the established transatlantic airlines have some serious competition on their hands			1
perhaps my friend and i will be finding ourselves travelling side - by - side in a @entity9 cabin in the not - too - distant future .			1

@entity9 airlines has been operating flights from @entity4 's @entity33 to @entity3 , @entity223 and @entity120 , @entity121 , since july
fares start at £ 150 ( *$* *235* ) for a one - way flight between @entity4 and @entity3
the airline says its fares are cheap because its new @entity64 planes use less fuel and the saving is passed on to the customer
