the staff members were absent after all but one of the school ’s teachers called in sick following a vote of no confidence in mrs @entity1 , who had been headteacher for 17 years , and her ‘ dictatorial ’ management style			1
she was later suspended and then sacked from the school in @entity40 following a catalogue of complaints from teachers and parents , which included calling children names , excessively shouting and punishing them in public			2
