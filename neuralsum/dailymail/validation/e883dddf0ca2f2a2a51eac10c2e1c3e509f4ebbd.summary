@entity1 knows the @entity2 ’ staggered final - day format leaves second - placed @entity3 poised to be agonisingly pipped at the post in the same way as in 2007 , but says they just need to deal with it			1
@entity3 handsomely beat @entity7 eight years ago on the final saturday of the tournament but @entity9 , playing last that day , went into their game knowing a 24 - point win over @entity12 would bag the title			1
they won by 27 , a late try denying @entity16 ’s side			2
now it ’s leaders @entity18 who have the scheduling advantage , as their game against @entity9 this weekend starts at 5pm following @entity3 ’s 2.30 kick - off in @entity12			1
@entity1 ( centre ) knows his side are likely to miss out on the @entity2 title after defeat to @entity28 however , @entity1 accepts the rules are the rules , claiming it would be ‘ crazy ’ to be critical of the organisers just a few days before the curtain comes down on the 2015 campaign			1
‘ it is the way it is and it presents different challenges , ’ said the back - up scrum half			1
‘ the teams that play early , they have got the mental battle of having to win the game and push on and the teams that play late have a target they can chase			2
‘ it ’s a flip of a coin whether you say that makes it more interesting or less interesting			2
tv rights would probably make the conversation null and void , the amount of money tv provides for @entity2			1
the fact that they all want to watch three games is probably the real answer and there is no other way they ’re going to do it			2
’ @entity28 dash @entity3 's @entity62 hopes @entity65 players make a last ditch effort to get the ball over the line during the @entity2 clash in @entity70 @entity1 came off the bench in @entity74 in 2007 , a day when long - serving hooker @entity71 and current assistant coach @entity72 started in the pack			1
@entity3 were 34 points to the good with time almost up only for @entity78 to tap a penalty in the hope of adding to his team ’s eight - try tally			1
instead , they were turned over and @entity7 scored a converted try through @entity84 to crucially help @entity9 ’s cause			0
@entity1 has n’t forgotten its consequences			1
‘ i remember us conceding a try late on that lost us the trophy , which we should n’t have conceded			0
we should have beaten @entity7 by that extra bit and we would have won the trophy			0
@entity94 is upended during his sides ' loss to @entity28 which ended their @entity62 hopes ‘ it ’s galling , but you do know the rules			0
you do know what time the games are on			0
‘ we ’re not really stepping back trying to judge the competition because it ’s not really going to change , is it ? ‘ especially for me , a few days out from this one , to be reflecting that the competition is a bit “ off ” would be crazy			0
at the end of the day , we ’re playing second and we ’re going to have a job to do from the start and that job may change as the game goes on or it may not , ’ added @entity1			1
‘ the way to win a title is probably not to think about a title , ’ he added			2
‘ it ’ s frustrating listening to us because you want to grasp on to the fact that we want to go and win the title and all that , but we have a responsibility where there is no margin for error , no margin for anything			2
@entity124 ( bottom ) is congratulated by his @entity127 team mates as they defeated @entity3 last saturday ‘ we ca n’t even live in that world ( of title talk ) so that is why we give you what we give you in terms of having to win the game first , because if you take your eye off that for a second there is no championship , there is no win			1
‘ treating @entity12 as if there is n’t a championship on the line is the key			0
realising how good they are , realising their threats and treating them just as you would if this game did n’t need to be a points margin ( win ) , treating them like that and keeping it on for the whole game			0
‘ there were games last year , like against @entity7 , which got us over the line in the overall			0
it was 12 points in the last three minutes			0
that is just about going and going and going again and not getting too carried away with the big picture , just doing your own little thing a bit harder , a bit faster and just keeping that mindset going all the time			0
‘ we have the responsibility of letting people dream and think big but our responsibility is to focus on the small little things and keep doing it to the end			0
’ @entity3 need to better @entity18 's score by four points if they want to win the coveted @entity2 crown			1

@entity1 says his @entity3 side know they *'re* to be pipped to the title
the scrum half does *n't* blame the schedule changes for television
@entity3 lie in second with @entity18 top of the @entity2 table
