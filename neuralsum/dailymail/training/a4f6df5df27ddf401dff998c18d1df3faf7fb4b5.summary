dementia patients and their families are being hit by a ‘ care tax ’ of more than £ 20,000 a year , research has revealed			1
they are forced to ‘ break the bank ’ to pay for extra basic help from their own pockets because it is not provided by local authorities			0
on top of that , relatives are having to undertake everyday tasks such as washing , feeding and dressing which often forces them to give up jobs			0
it is predicted there will be more than 850,000 people in the @entity21 with @entity23 's disease in 2015 it is now estimated that of the £ 26billion a year cost of dementia to the @entity21 , patients and their families are picking up two - thirds of the amount – about £ 17.4billion			1
the @entity30 was commissioned by the @entity31 to calculate the care burden – and found that the average dementia patient and their relatives are hit by a ‘ tax ’ of £ 21,322 a year			1
the figure includes £ 7,085 to pay for private carers on top of an estimated £ 14,237 in unpaid care provided by family members themselves			1
health secretary @entity42 accepted that the costs were ‘ unfair ’ to families and promised to provide more financial help to families			2
he said : ‘ i want to make sure those with dementia , their families and carers get the help they need			2
it ’s precisely because people face such unfair care costs that we are transforming the way people pay for care , capping the amount they have to pay and providing more financial help			1
’ @entity31 says that thousands are paying a ' dementia tax ' to cover their dementia care costs @entity64 , chief executive of the @entity31 , said it was wrong that patients had to pay for their own care when those with cancer or heart disease had care provided free by the @entity71			1
‘ this new research exposes the staggering financial and human impact of dementia , ’ he said			0
‘ it is plain to see that our social care system is on its knees , leaving an army of tens of thousands of unpaid carers bearing the brunt			1
‘ if you have cancer or heart disease you can quite rightly expect that the care you need will be free			0
that is just not the case for people with dementia			2
‘ families are forced to break the bank to pay for basic care for a loved one			2
’ problems arise because home care is not provided by the @entity71 but by local councils – whose budgets have been slashed , forcing many families to pick up the tab for private care themselves			0
by contrast , patients with heart disease or cancer are assured of free care on the @entity71 – because health budgets have been protected from cuts			0
the research also found that an estimated 225,000 people in the @entity21 develop the condition every year – or one person every three minutes			1
this means that by next year , 850,000 patients will have the condition , rising to two million by 2051			2
alzheimer 's disease is the most common cause of dementia			0
it is predicted there will be more than 850,000 people in the @entity21 with @entity23 's disease in 2015			1
the term ' dementia ' describes a set of symptoms which can include loss of memory , mood changes , and problems with communication and reasoning			0
these symptoms occur when the brain is damaged by certain diseases and conditions , including alzheimer 's disease			0
@entity23 's is the most common cause of dementia			1
symptoms occur when the brain is damaged by certain diseases and conditions , including @entity141			0
alzheimer 's disease , first described by the @entity144 neurologist @entity23 , is a physical disease affecting the brain			2
during the course of the disease , protein ' plaques ' and ' tangles ' develop in the structure of the brain , leading to the death of brain cells			0
people with @entity23 's also have a shortage of some important chemicals in their brain			1
these chemicals are involved with the transmission of messages within the brain			0
@entity23 's is a progressive disease , which means that gradually , over time , more parts of the brain are damaged			1
as this happens , the symptoms become more severe			0

**sufferers** and families are paying as much as £ 21,000 a year covering the costs of social care and unpaid care by family members and friends
researchers have calculated the cost of dementia to the @entity21 has hit £ 26 billion a year , through health and social care costs
but people with the condition , and their families , are *shouldering* two - thirds of the cost - around £ 17.4 billion annually
it is predicted there will be more than 850,000 @entity23 's **sufferers** by 2015
@entity31 calls for @entity190 to end the ' artificial divide ' between health and social care , which ' unfairly *disadvantages* ' people with dementia
