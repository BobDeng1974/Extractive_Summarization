by @entity0 @entity1 has become so reliant on imports that the country would run out of food today if we only had @entity1 - grown produce to eat			1
our farmers now produce just 60 per cent of the total food we consume - meaning that if our import supply was cut off we could only feed the nation until august 7 each year			1
agricultural self - sufficiency has fallen 15 percentage points from 75 per cent in 1991 , according to @entity14 figures			1
@entity1 farmers now produce just 60 per cent of the total food consumed in @entity1 - meaning that if our import supply was cut off we could only feed the nation until august 7 each year ( file picture ) farming leaders insist they have the capacity to boost production , but they say they need the support of politicians , retailers and consumers to ensure increasing demand			1
the @entity28 last night called for a coherent plan to boost agriculture , including better promotion of homegrown food , more tax breaks for farmers and better support from supermarkets			1
@entity28 president @entity37 said last night : ‘ if we were completely reliant on @entity1 food the larder would be empty tomorrow , that is a quite scary thought and should be a wake - up call for society			1
‘ farmers react to markets , they react to confidence levels , they are willing to invest in the future if they have that confidence			0
‘ otherwise we will end up with 70 million people in the @entity1 , only able to produce half of the food we need			1
‘ we need to ratchet up our ability to produce			0
‘ we need to sit down and develop a growth plan because the industry is going to require a huge level of investment in the years to come			0
’ successive governments have tried - and failed - to tackle the slide in farming production			1
ministers are worried not only about the impact on @entity1 agriculture , but also about being too reliant on inconsistent foreign food supplies and turbulent prices			1
with a growing global population , the problem is only going to get worse as more people compete for resources			0
@entity28 president @entity37 called for a coherent plan to boost agriculture			0
he said : ‘ we need to sit down and develop a growth plan because the industry is going to require a huge level of investment in years to come ' mr @entity37 said : ‘ even though the latest figures are startling , @entity1 farming is a sector we can be proud of			2
it produces the raw ingredients for the £ 97billion @entity1 food and drink industry			2
‘ but the trade gap is widening – while our export performance has doubled in the last decade , we are spending £ 21.3billion more on imports than we are receiving from exports – up from £ 10.2billion in 1991			0
‘ what needs to happen now is for us as a country is to give farmers the green light to produce more food for us			2
‘ our aim is to ensure the country - consumers , politicians , retailers and the wider food industry - is backing @entity1 farming , and within this , a solid plan for agricultural growth to ensure the current self - sufficiency trend is reversed and long - term food security is supported			1
’ the @entity1 record is poor when compared to other nations			0
while we produce just 60 per cent of our needs , other developed nations manage to feed their populations while maintaining high exports			2
@entity108 , for example , produces more than 170 per cent of the food it needs , the @entity111 about 120 per cent and @entity112 110 per cent			0
part of the problem is that @entity1 does not just ship in exotic produce such as bananas and pineapples , but also buys in cheaper varieties of food we could produce perfectly well in this country			1
it means that food such as @entity112 apples , @entity125 cucumbers , @entity127 bacon and @entity129 runner beans fill our supermarket shelves , even in the spring and summer months			0
last year we imported 27 per cent of food that could have been produced domestically , up from 23 per cent the year before , and 13 per cent in 1991			2
in a bid to tackle the problem , the government last month announced that the @entity135 and all @entity137 departments will now buy @entity1 food where possible , even if it is more expensive , and schools and hospitals will be expected to follow suit			2
successive opinion polls have shown that shoppers would prefer to buy @entity1 where possible , but farmers complain that unclear labelling and marketing makes it difficult for them to do so			0
last month , for example , @entity148 was criticised for promoting @entity151 lamb at the very time when @entity1 lamb is at its very best			0
the @entity28 wants to see a plan which will include financial measures to boost on - farm investment in machinery and infrastructure such as water storage and buildings			0
it would also include measures to improve access to new crops , biotechnology and growing systems , and for fair , transparent supply chains and secure returns from processors , retailers and caterers			0
a spokesman for the @entity172 said : ‘ we continue to work with industry and support @entity1 producers to help boost food production - this includes our £ 160 million agri - tech strategy , driving innovation in farming and developing new resilient varieties of crops , and our plan to see the public sector sourcing £ 400 million pounds worth of food from the @entity1 that they currently import			1

@entity1 farmers now produce just 60 per cent of the total food @entity1 consume
agricultural self - sufficiency has fallen 15 per cent from 75 per cent in 1991
farming leaders insist they can boost production but need national support
