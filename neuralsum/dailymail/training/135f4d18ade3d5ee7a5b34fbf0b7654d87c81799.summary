by @entity0 , political correspondent increase : the number of operations cancelled on the day they were due to go ahead has hit its highest total for nine years , according to official figures the number of operations cancelled on the day they were due to go ahead has hit its highest total for nine years , according to official figures			1
in a sign of mounting pressure on many @entity13 trusts , it has emerged that between april and june 15,661 scheduled operations were cancelled at the last minute for non-medical reasons			1
that is the highest since the same three months in 2005 when 15,690 operations were cancelled on the day they were supposed to be carried out			1
but the @entity19 said the proportion of operations cancelled at the last minute is only 0.8 per cent , around the same as in previous years			1
it said the proportion has not changed because doctors carried out more than half a million more operations this year than in the same period eight years ago , driven by the ageing population and medical advances			2
@entity28 blames increases in the number of patients attending accident and emergency departments for the rise in cancelled operations			2
this spring the vast majority of patients affected had their operation rescheduled within a month , but 800 were left waiting longer			0
the data , published by @entity39 , relates to elective operations – scheduled in advance – not emergency surgery			1
in the same quarter of 2006 the number of cancelled operations was only 12,548			2
in spring 2011 , the year after the @entity44 came to power , it was 12,780			0
@entity13 guidance states that common non-medical reasons for cancelling an operation include lack of ward beds available , the lack of an available surgeon , anaesthetist or theatre staff ; an emergency case needing the theatre , equipment failure , or lack of a critical care bed			2
last week figures from @entity39 showed there are now 3.2million people on @entity13 waiting lists for operations , with some being forced to wait more than a year			1
the total is the highest since the target of treating 90 per cent of patients with 18 weeks was introduced six years ago			0
concern : a spokesman for health secretary @entity70 ( left ) said it was important to reduce the waiting list for operations responsibly , while the @entity28 's @entity74 ( right ) said hospitals are ' full to bursting ' ministers admit it may not be met again for months while the backlog is cleared			0
but a spokesman for health secretary @entity70 said it was important to reduce the waiting list responsibly – rather than try to meet the target by prioritising simple procedures rather than complex but life - changing operations which take longer			0
labour health spokesman @entity74 said : ‘ not only are people waiting longer for operations , increasing numbers are facing the appalling anxiety and indignity of preparing for treatment only to be let down just hours before surgery			0
‘ hospitals are full to bursting , with record numbers in @entity93 , and this is threatening to drag down the rest of the @entity13			0
’ an @entity39 spokesman said : ‘ @entity39 believes all cancellations should be avoided wherever possible			0
however , the level of cancellations remains low , in the context of the millions of operations performed in the @entity13 each year			1
’ a @entity19 spokesman said : ‘ the number of operations cancelled in this quarter has remained steady at less than 1 per cent of all elective admissions , despite the fact that the @entity13 is responding to significantly increased demand by performing more than half a million more operations now than in the same period eight years ago			1

a *staggering* 15,661 operations cancelled on day they were scheduled for
@entity113 , highest for nine years , is sign of increasing pressure on @entity13 trusts
but @entity19 said these *accounted* for just 0.8 *%* of operations
new figures relate to elective operations between april and june this year
