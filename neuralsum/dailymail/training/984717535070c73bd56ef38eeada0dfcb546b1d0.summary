by @entity0 published : 04:25 est , 27 november 2012 updated : 11:32 est , 27 november 2012 a @entity2 man who is alleged to have stripped naked after climbed a statue of the @entity5 in @entity6 , broke his two front teeth trying to bite its head off			1
@entity10 , 29 , climbed to the top of the 20ft statue of @entity14 @entity13 in @entity15 , and broke off its sword before attempting to decapitate it last week			1
@entity18 heard how the incident could have been the result of a ' psychotic episode '			1
on his head : police were forced to close an entire section of the road - which runs between the @entity26 and @entity28 - while specialist officers tried to coax the man down mr @entity10 , a @entity2 national of no fixed address , has been charged with possessing an offensive weapon in a public place , criminal damage and a public order offence			1
during the incident he is said to have ' attacked ' the @entity5 , breaking his sword off and then attempting to decapitate him			1
appearing in court , mr @entity10 looked disheveled and exposed his stomach as he walked into the dock			1
he refused to cooperate with the proceedings and the court was told he sacked his solicitor this morning			0
describing the incident prosecutor @entity43 said : ' officers attended the scene which is in @entity15 and came across a bag that had been abandoned			1
' the bag was searched and found to be empty , at which point the defendant was seen to climb on a statue of the @entity5			1
' the defendant was seen to attack the statue breaking off the sword and waving it around before removing all his clothes			1
' he attempted to pull the head off the statue unsuccessfully			0
he then tried to bite it breaking off two of his front teeth in the process			0
' mr @entity10 asked if he could hand a crumpled note up to district judge @entity63 which explained he was at risk of being deported			2
asked to confirm his details he said : ' i refuse to take part in this case			0
' stubborn : despite temperatures hovering around @entity72 , chilled further by a mild south - westerly breeze , the man stubbornly remained on his perch apparently ignoring officers ' pleas centre of defence : hundreds of baffled passers by gathered in the busy road , which runs between the @entity26 and @entity28 , to watch the exhibition unfold in wonder and when asked by @entity85 what the incident was all about @entity10 repeatedly claimed he could not remember			2
a health care professional who was in court said the defendant had been examined in hospital and said : ' this is possibly a psychotic episode			0
' @entity10 sat with his arms folded throughout the hearing and said : ' i want to be deported to @entity2 and have this case heard by the courts of @entity2			2
' he was told this was not possible and asked if he would like to be represented by a duty solicitor who could come to court			0
but @entity10 replied : ' i wo n't talk to them			2
i wo n't do anything			0
' the judge asked if there was anything else @entity10 wanted to say but the defendant just stared at him blankly			0
judge @entity85 said he wanted him to be looked at again by a mental health team and remanded him in custody until his next court appearance on november 29			0
chilly : the naked man could be seen waving his arms , apparently speaking to emergency services on the ground , and did not seem to be holding anything sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			0
