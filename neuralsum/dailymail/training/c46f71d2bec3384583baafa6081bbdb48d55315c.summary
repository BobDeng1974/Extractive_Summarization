it is not often a player will celebrate a success for their closest rivals , but @entity6 ’s @entity5 appeared delighted that @entity7 had made it through to the knockout stages of the @entity10			1
before beating @entity11 , @entity7 were facing not only the prospect of exiting the competition but finishing bottom of their group and not even having @entity18 consolation			1
@entity7 are also lurking just three points behind @entity6 in the @entity20 despite the @entity21 ’ 23 - match unbeaten run , which was ended last weekend by @entity24			1
so @entity5 saw much to be pleased about			0
@entity6 centre back @entity5 , in action against @entity26 on wednesday , is glad @entity7 progressed ‘ maybe @entity7 would have rested players ( had they gone out ) or maybe they would have had more time to prepare for games , ’ @entity5 said after @entity6 ’s 3 - 1 win over @entity26 that made them the highest scoring team in the @entity10 group stages with 17 goals			1
‘ who knows if that will have any impact in the league ? ’ @entity6 have made themselves the team to beat this season , crushing opponents in that undefeated run which included victories against @entity43 , @entity44 and @entity45 and draws away to both @entity47 clubs			2
manager @entity48 has even claimed that some teams up their game against @entity6 while treating matches against other opponents as though they are friendlies			0
@entity5 celebrates after his header was turned in by @entity55 during @entity6 's 3 - 1 win against @entity26 @entity57 celebrates his screamer of a goal on wednesday as @entity7 won 2 - 0 at @entity11 but 15 games into the @entity20 campaign city — who have lost to @entity63 , @entity64 and @entity24 already — are still hanging in there , waiting to strike			1
@entity5 has called it right			0
@entity6 are still fighting on four fronts — @entity10 , @entity20 , @entity68 and @entity69			1
if @entity7 had just the @entity68 and @entity20 to play for , they would be a different , more threatening , proposition			2

‘ we think about that — how hard we worked and how well everyone spoke about how we were playing but yet we ’re three points in front with many games to go			0
’ @entity79 international @entity78 celebrates @entity6 's second against @entity26 on wednesday last season , @entity6 were 46 minutes away from the @entity10 final but three goals from @entity84 sent them out			2
@entity5 has experienced winning the @entity10 with @entity6 — six months after joining in january 2012 — as well as being knocked out at the group stage with 10 points and that agonising defeat by @entity84			1
‘ last year we were close but i feel that we ’re going stronger this season , ’ he said			0
