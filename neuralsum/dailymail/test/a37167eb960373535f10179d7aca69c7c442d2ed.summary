you do n't have to be an avid follower of @entity2 to know that @entity3 has struggled badly at @entity4 this year			0
goals have been hard to come by for the @entity6 , with just four being netted by the striker this season in a @entity2 shirt having signed on a season - long loan from @entity11			2
but not only has @entity3 failed to score since january 31 against @entity13 , he has also failed to have a shot on target in the @entity16 - featuring in 10 games since.during that period he has collected £ 3,080,000 in wages			2
@entity3 fires wide for @entity2 past @entity21 's onrushing keeper @entity22 @entity3 stands dejected with @entity23 at the final whistle following @entity2 's 1 - 0 loss at @entity21 @entity3 looks on with @entity26 waiting to kick - off following @entity28 's strike granted , @entity3 has not always featured for the @entity29 but the striker 's £ 280,000 - a - week wages are a massive burden for @entity2 , making a permanent move this summer even more unlikely despite the uncertain future of strike partner @entity35			1
@entity3 started in @entity2 's 1 - 0 defeat at @entity21 on saturday , but despite playing the full 90 minutes for a side that bossed over 70 per cent of the ball , he struggled to get involved in the game			1
the striker saw a shot blocked by @entity42 and had another two shots fly wide in the second half			0
but otherwise the @entity6 's biggest impact was a negative one as he lost the ball following a @entity48 challenge in the build up to @entity28 's winning goal at @entity50			0
following another failed audition in front of manager @entity54 , @entity3 's @entity16 adventure is set to go down as a costly mistake for the @entity29			0
@entity48 had the upper hand on @entity3 in their personal scrap , with the @entity21 captain winning the ball off the striker to start a move which led to @entity28 's goal in the @entity16 clash @entity3 has n't scored or had a shot on target for @entity2 since netting against @entity13 in january @entity68 's @entity67 shows @entity3 's heat map for the striker 's display at @entity21			1
