by @entity0 published : 08:29 est , 18 march 2013 updated : 02:47 est , 19 march 2013 the @entity2 father who died with his son on @entity4 was yesterday criticised for going on a perilous hike with the wrong equipment			1
@entity7 , 48 , plunged to his death with 12 - year - old @entity9 after trekking along a precipitous , snow and ice - covered path on @entity13 ’s highest mountain			1
they fell up to 1,000ft after slipping on the treacherous trail overlooking the vast @entity16 , near @entity17			0
@entity7 ( left ) and @entity9 ( right ) @entity7 were wearing shoes fit for the summer when they fell to their deaths @entity20 : the helicopter rescue of @entity7 and @entity22 who died whilst walking in @entity17 on saturday afternoon			1
the pictures show one of the victims being winched with a rescuer aboard the rescue helicopter with the @entity16 as a backdrop the bodies of the father and son were found after a photo taken of them earlier in the day was used to locate them yesterday professional guides questioned why the pair , from @entity38 , ventured out without ropes , crampons and ice axes			1
@entity42 , a @entity2 mountain guide based in @entity17 , said : ‘ you ’ve got to ask yourself , “ would you really want to take your 12 - year - old son up a trail covered in snow and ice to look at a glacier ? is it a sensible thing to do ? ” ‘ the father was foolish at best to attempt that ascent with his son			1
things can go wrong very quickly on the mountain			0
’ mountain expert @entity57 added : ‘ they should have had crampons , ice axes and been roped together to make their way across the hard - packed snow that covers these slopes			1
’ the pair had arrived only hours earlier , flying into @entity65 and then hiring a car , for a ‘ weekend of adventure ’			2
earlier this month no fewer than 10 people - including mountaineers and off - piste skiers - died in the @entity4 area tragedy : they plunged down a mountain at @entity17 mr @entity57 , a professional guide and a @entity17 councillor responsible for mountain security , described the pair ’s footwear – summer hiking boots – as like ‘ trainers with modified soles ’			1
he added : ‘ the father , mr @entity7 , made a terrible error			1
they simply got off the plane and raced straight up the mountain without asking advice and without the right equipment			2
’ @entity17 mayor , @entity90 , added : ‘ they should not have attempted that hike which is not sign - posted in winter			1
if they had taken the trouble to ask for advice from the mountain centre , we would have told them not to go			0
we would have offered them a different route			0
’ the trail they were attempting to follow – ‘ @entity103 ’ – begins in the valley close to the entrance of the @entity4 tunnel and climbs through thick woodland			0
captain @entity108 of the @entity109 said : ‘ this is the real mountain			0
the tragic pair died in the popular skiing destination of @entity17 in the @entity114 @entity113 ‘ there is no rope to hold on to and the signs , which are clearly visible in the summer , are now completely covered in snow			1
‘ it is inconceivable that someone would attempt this route in winter			0
there is ice everywhere and it is impossible to stick to the trail because of the snow			1
‘ no one uses this trail until the end of spring – when the snow has melted			1
’ he added that accident investigators were examining the theory that the pair had turned back after getting into difficulties			2
mr @entity7 , a businessman , rang police at 2.55pm on saturday to tell them @entity9 had fallen into a gully and he could not see him			1
the father is believed to have lost his own footing minutes later as he frantically searched for his son			2
the @entity2 ’ bodies were found on sunday morning , lying 150ft apart in the deep @entity141 gully			0
@entity9 ’s mother , @entity143 , 44 , and his sister @entity144 , 15 , paid tribute to the pair in a statement released by the @entity148			0
it said : ‘ @entity9 was always full of life , had a really happy temperament and loved spending time with his father			0
‘ @entity7 was fantastic at making things happen , resourceful , with a positive approach to life			1
‘ they will both be sorely missed by friends and family alike			0
’ at 15,780ft , @entity4 is notoriously dangerous and features some of the most technically difficult climbs in the world			0
so far , ten skiers and mountaineers have been killed in the area this month			0
the father and son are thought to have reached a high altitude by taking the chair lift from @entity169 village to the approaches of the @entity16 , at 1400m			2
from there , they are thought to have set off on the well - known @entity173 ( @entity174 ) hike , which is hugely popular with tourists , especially in the summer months			1
@entity173 is a rocky spur from which hikers can look out towards the @entity169 and @entity180 glaciers			0
it was is on the route taken by the @entity114 who first ascended @entity4 in 1786			0
the slopes around @entity4 , the highest peak in western @entity13 , are notoriously dangerous , with scores of mountaineers , skiers and hikers dying on them every year			2
not only is the fabled ‘ @entity4 ’ 15,780 feet high , but the climbs around it are some of the most technically difficult in the world			0
despite this , it is often mistakenly claimed that people can enjoy an easy stroll up the @entity197 set off on paths every day without ice axes or crampons , let alone other basic equipment like extra food supplies and tents			1
many of the 20,000 - plus people who attempt to reach the summit each year are inexperienced or completely novice climbers			2
earlier this month no fewer than 10 people – including mountaineers and off - piste skiers – died in the @entity4 area .			2

@entity7 has been criticised for taking 12 - year - old on dangerous hike
he and son @entity22 died at ' @entity216 ' in @entity217
pair had set off on hike without specialist equipment like crampons
spring thaw of snow and ice creates *potentially* lethal conditions
