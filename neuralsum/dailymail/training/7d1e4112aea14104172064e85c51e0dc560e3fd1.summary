he inherited the collection from his father , @entity22 , one of @entity24 's four official art dealers responsible for trading in artworks pillaged from @entity27 families across the @entity9			1
however , the museum 's president , @entity48 , told reporters in @entity51 today that it would only accept the collection on the grounds that efforts are made to return any art looted from @entity27 collectors to its rightful owners			1
before his death , @entity19 reached a deal with the @entity6 government to check whether any of the works were indeed looted			1
authorities say that deal is binding on any heirs			0
one of @entity19 's cousins has also filed claim , which a @entity41 court said today would have to be sorted out before the collection goes anywhere			1

and in september a painting by @entity15 was discovered in a suitcase belonging to @entity19			1
during @entity101 , the @entity37 went on a looting rampage , destroying and stealing an estimated 750,000 pieces of @entity105 art. the years between 1933 and 1945 are a black hole in the art community , with thousands of pieces of art changing hands and going missing			2
much of it has never been found			0
the @entity37 took so - called degenerate art - mostly avant - garde modern art , such as expressionism - from museums and public institutions because it was deemed a corrupting influence on the @entity6 people			0
masterpiece : this painting by @entity6 artist @entity122 , called ' two @entity123 ' , has been valued at between £ 6 and 8 million unknown : an artwork by the @entity6 artist @entity127 ( left ) and a formerly unknown picture by @entity6 artist @entity129 entitled " @entity130 ' ( right ) are also part of the hoard stolen : @entity133 ’ @entity132 masterpiece once belonged to the @entity27 industrialist @entity134 , who was forced to sell it by the @entity37			0

the dealers , who answered directly to @entity24 's propaganda chief @entity148 , then marketed the pillaged art to buyers abroad , funnelling profits into the @entity9 war chest			1
after the war , a vast portion of this loot was discovered by the ' @entity157 ' section of the @entity158 , tasked with finding the stolen art of @entity105 and restoring it to its rightful owners			0
the @entity157 moved into the @entity163 village of @entity164 in @entity163 in april 1945 and arrested the local @entity9 party leader baron @entity165 who lived in the local castle along with art dealer @entity167 and @entity140			1
a note from a @entity157 team member found in an archive detailed the astonishing artworks found in the castle : ' rooms containing paintings , tapestries , statues , valuable furniture and documents from the belongings of two notorious @entity6 art dealers were found in the castle			0
' the flat : since @entity19 was unemployed and with no obvious means of income , prosecutors obtained a warrant to search his small flat in @entity88 , @entity41 , upon which police found more than a thousand pieces of art , with an estimated value of up to € 50 million towards the end of the @entity101 , soldiers began stumbling upon treasure troves of stolen art , including this one in a salt mine at @entity195 , @entity6 , which is being inspected by @entity198 general @entity197 another reads : ' a large room on the upper floor with 34 boxes , two packages containing carpets , eight packages of books … one room on the ground floor containing an additional 13 boxes owned by mr @entity19			2

' but during interrogation , @entity19 claimed all the art he still possessed had been destroyed in his home during the allied bombing of @entity234			2
