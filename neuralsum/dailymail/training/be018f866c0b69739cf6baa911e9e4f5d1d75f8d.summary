@entity1 spent as much as $ 50,000 a trip in the midterm elections to fly @entity4 and @entity5 into battleground areas to make appearances on behalf of top congressional and gubernatorial candidates , a news report revealed today			1
and the party has little to show for the massive expenditures , expected to collectively reach a $ 1 million when final campaign finance reports are turned in			1
democrats lost their majority in the upper chamber of the legislative branch , and @entity18 underdog candidates nosed ahead in several governors races			1
failed to deliver : @entity21 secretary of state @entity20 , left , campaigns with former @entity23 secretary of state @entity5 , right , during a campaign rally on nov. 1			1
federal election filings show that @entity20 paid $ 17,000 to have @entity26 flown in to drudge up votes for her in october , yet she still lost the @entity29 paid $ 50,000 to bring former president @entity26 and @entity5 into the @entity30 to headline retiring sen. @entity33 's annual steak fry in september and campaign for @entity1 @entity35 nominee @entity34 as @entity37 pointed out on election night , just eight of the 17 high - profile candidates @entity5 personally campaigned for won reelection last week			1
additionally , @entity41 sen. @entity40 got hands - on campaign help from @entity4 , but not from @entity5 – and he also lost			1
one other senator @entity5 backed , @entity45 's @entity44 , is headed to a run - off election next month that polls say she will likely lose , giving the political power couple an eight for 18 record overall this fall			2
a more comprehensive review of the @entity52 ' travel schedule issued by @entity53 today that includes fundraisers and all the races the duo involved themselves in at every level of government puts @entity4 's individual count at 47 candidates and @entity5 's at upward of 26			1
the news publication 's research shows that the former first couple participated in approximately 75 rallies and fundraisers and flew more than 50,000 miles crisscrossing the country - in private jets - on behalf of @entity1 candidates			0
@entity53 discovered that the party 's top recruits spent at least $ 699,000 on the @entity52 ' travel through oct. 15 , when the last finance reports were due			1
among those candidates willing to pay the big bucks in order to buy an appearance from a @entity26 were @entity21 secretary of state @entity20 , the @entity1 nominee to the @entity35 in the @entity21			0
@entity20 - who handily lost her race to senate minority leader @entity78 - paid $ 17,000 for @entity5 's charter flight ahead of an oct. 15 appearance , @entity79 revealed last week			1
she paid a yet - to - be disclosed sum for @entity5 to return to @entity21 in the final days of the campaign , as well , that is likely on par with the original billing			1
according to @entity87 , the @entity29 paid $ 50,000 in september to bring both @entity52 to the state to headline retiring sen. @entity33 's annual steak fry and campaign for their chosen replacement for @entity33 's seat , rep. @entity34 , whom @entity26 unforgettably called ' @entity95 ' in his remarks			2
@entity1 again paid to bring both @entity52 back to the @entity30 on two separate occasions to campaign for @entity34 - who also lost - but those trips have not yet been reported to the @entity99			2
most of the high - profile @entity1 the @entity26 's campaigned for this fall lost their races			1
that includes @entity35 candidate @entity103 , seen here at an october 31 rally in at @entity105 , @entity106 with @entity26 in an email today highlighting @entity5 's eyebrow - raising travel costs both on and off the campaign trail , the @entity107 gave the presumed 2016 presidential candidate the nickname ' high - flying @entity5 ' in response to @entity53 's report			1
' the @entity52 ' @entity116 with a @entity117 , ' read the briefing 's tagline			0
' it 's not just political events where @entity5 prefers to " travel in style , ' the document said , pointing back to a @entity125 article outlining the former first lady 's expensive tastes			2
on top of her six - figure speaking fees , a contract with the @entity137 shows that she usually demands to fly on a ' @entity141 or larger jet , ' accommodations in the ' presidential suite ' of hotels , rooms in the same block for her entourage of ' travel aids , ' $ 500 to cover her lead aide 's out - of - pocket costs and money to cover her party 's meals and ' incidentals			2
' her contract also specifies how her presence at the events can be billed and how many people she will take photos with afterward			0
@entity107 research firm @entity153 , a leading voice in the anti-clinton 2016 sphere , has been documenting @entity26 's cushy travel accommodations for months			0
in a blog post today the group said , ' @entity1 griping about the president ’s fundraising or lack thereof for their midterm campaign might want to take note of the expensive tab the @entity52 billed campaigns for their private jet travel			1
' ' @entity167 seems like what really happened was @entity169 got midterm democrats to foot the bill for her 2016 campaign travel , ' the group said in an @entity174 blog			1
former @entity41 gov. @entity26 's appearances on behalf of @entity1 sen. @entity40 were n't enough to save the @entity41 lawmaker , either one candidate @entity5 campaigned for , @entity45 sen. @entity44 , may still have a shot at keeping her seat in a run - off election next month , but the odds are n't good throughout the fall @entity153 has suggested in emails to reporters that millionaire @entity26 should pay for her own way when she drops in to election hot zones			2
' keep in mind it would only take 4 hours worth of speaking gigs for @entity5 to have picked up the travel tab herself , ' it said today in a post on its website			2
however , as @entity53 points out , that would violate election laws in most circumstances			0
asked for a clarification on the organization 's argument today , @entity153 executive director @entity195 told @entity199 in an email : ' the @entity52 traveled to plenty of campaign events on corporate dimes this past cycle			0
' @entity195 pointed to @entity26 's trip to @entity125 , during which she managed to work in a campaign stop for the @entity208 and @entity35 majority leader @entity209 into her schedule while there on behalf of @entity211			0
at another point this fall @entity26 made a brief public appearance with @entity215 gov. @entity214 and attended a fundraiser for him while she was in the city on other business			0
@entity195 told @entity199 the point of @entity153 's comments about her travel funding was to bring attention to the ' absurdity of her speaking fees in addition to the excessive cost they put on campaigns			0
' plus there are options for cheaper travel , of course , ' he said			0
@entity26 could , theoretically , travel commercially , as fellow 2016 frontrunner @entity236 did this election cycle as he hopped from state to state			0
realistically , though , it would be more difficult , if not impossible , for the @entity52 , who still have mandatory @entity242 details , to take transportation open to the public			0
@entity53 noted in its report that @entity5 often travels with four agents			0
getting all of them seats near her on cross country flights , sometimes into rural airports , would be complicated , to say the least .			0

expenditures on the @entity52 ' travel are expected to collectively reach a $ 1 million when final campaign finance reports are turned in
just eight of the 17 high - profile candidates @entity5 personally campaigned for won reelection last week
