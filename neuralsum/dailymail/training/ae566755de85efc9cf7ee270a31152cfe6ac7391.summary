by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 has questioned the psyche of the @entity5 selectors after they opted for @entity7 ahead of @entity8 for the series against @entity10			1
prior will keep wicket when the first test starts at @entity13 on thursday morning , even though there were calls for @entity16 and co to opt for the @entity19 glovesman			1
former @entity21 spinner can not fathom why the 32 - year - old has got the nod over the youthful @entity8			1
safe hands ! @entity2 argues that @entity8 should have been selected in the @entity5 squad this week keeping his spot : @entity7 will be behind the stumps when @entity5 face @entity10 at @entity13 on thursday ' i find it really surprising they have gone back to @entity7			1
when you are restructuring the team , why pick prior and not @entity8 ? ' @entity2 wrote in his @entity34 column			2
' he has just shown how dangerous he is with the bat with a brilliant one - day hundred , so stick with him while he is on a roll			0
' @entity5 dropped him for a reason			2
he was not doing the job properly			0
' @entity8 's performances with the bat in county cricket have n't been enough to force his way into @entity45 ' squad			0
the 23 - year - old averages only 36 in the @entity47 ; but that should n't have stopped @entity5 including him , argues @entity2			1
' i hope this is not a teacher 's , or should i say , coach 's pet selection			0
@entity8 gives that extra dimension with his batting , ' he added			0
' i played for @entity21 when @entity57 first came into the side			2
he was not a complete keeper then , but he improved and everyone wanted a @entity57 , and why would n't you , because of his brilliant batting at seven			0
' too much to ask ? @entity2 wants @entity16 's men to play an exciting brand of cricket this week			1

@entity5 host @entity10 in a two - test series
the first test starts at @entity13 on thursday morning
former @entity21 spinner @entity2 said @entity16 and the selectors should *'ve* gone with youth
