' there is still an awful lot to play for in the remaining weeks of the season			2
' no - one here is thinking that things are done and dusted			2
' if @entity25 were to beat us in a couple of weeks at @entity41 , it would make things tighter and the boys will just keep focused			1
' to be fair , everyone has been focused			0
as you saw against @entity11 , it was not our best performance of the season			0

' the boys deserve a lot of credit for being able to do that			0
' @entity11 midfielder @entity82 admits there is little chance of catching their city rivals , with 19 points now separating the sides			1
