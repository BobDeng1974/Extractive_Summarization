by @entity0 published : 06:27 est , 3 september 2013 updated : 11:22 est , 3 september 2013 a comedian has become a virtual globetrotter after embarking on a mission to talk to one person from every country in the world			2
@entity7 has managed to contact more than 80 per cent of the world 's nations via @entity10 - including the secretive state of @entity12			1
now he has channelled his surreal experiences into a @entity15 video charting a manic three - day computer sessions during which he spent 27 hours talking to people from all corners of the world			1
he immediately got a warm response from his 3,600 followers , offering to put him in touch with their friends living in obscure countries around the world			1
the 36 - year - old was dependent on the generosity of strangers , who were happy to spend 10 minutes talking to a man they 'd never met for the project , designed to celebrate @entity10 's 10th anniversary			1
in the end , he managed to contact 162 different countries - including war - torn states such as @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 and @entity62			1
watch more of the video on the @entity64 @entity15 striking : mr @entity7 was impressed with the futuristic skyline of @entity66 in the @entity67 @entity68 : mr @entity7 connected with people around the world by making funny faces at them remote : he even found contacts in troubled countries such as @entity59 , @entity60 and @entity61 ' i wanted to show how the world is getting smaller and show how technology is bringing us together , ' he said			1
' i put out a call on @entity41 and @entity79 to find someone to @entity10 with in every single country - and i was overwhelmed by the response			0
' i did n't know most of these people - i just said , " can i call you ? " ' i was touched that people wanted to let me into their homes and share their family and their country with me			2
people are so proud of their countries and really wanted to show me the best of them			2
' of all the many conversations mr @entity7 had , the one he which he found the most ' meaningful ' was with @entity97 , because of the extraordinary show which the country put on for him			2
' the person i talked to arranged for an @entity97 pub to play for me , ' he said			0
joke : mr @entity7 boasted that his wife was @entity104 - but his new @entity106 friend did not recognise her from @entity108 reality show @entity107 tour guide : the comedian liked to conduct his calls near @entity35 landmarks such as @entity113 , pictured unexpected : when he was talking to @entity114 , the comedian came face to face with a chicken connection : mr @entity7 was able to establish a bond with almost anyone through a shared love of pets another memorable experience was talking to @entity12 , when a woman who runs tours to the country agreed to chat to him while she watched a football match			1
' i was determined to speak to someone in @entity12 , because so many people told me it could n't be done , ' he said			2
' it was definitely the most difficult call to arrange , but it was among my favourites			0
' when i called @entity135 , they answered the call in @entity136 - that was amazing			0
i got to see so many places that i would never have been able to go to @entity139 in real time			0
' i answered as many calls as i could in @entity35 , and showed people the @entity143 or @entity113 - and i think people liked chatting to me just as much as i enjoyed chatting to them			1
' most people managed to speak @entity147 , and i know some @entity148 , so i managed to speak to most people , but there were a few where we just smiled and waved at each other and showed each other our surroundings			2
' i got to see a lot of pets - and people wanted to see my pets too			0
' victory ! perhaps the hardest country of all to contact is @entity12 , but mr @entity7 managed it family : the virtual globetrotter has been delighted to connect with people around the world exhausted : but mr @entity7 is still keen to get in touch with the final 31 countries on the list mr @entity7 never even saw the face of one of his new friends - when he called @entity173 , he spoke to a @entity175 woman wearing a burqa which covered up her features			1
but the most surreal conversation came when he needed to tick off the @entity179 - and skyped his wife as she was sitting in the next room			0
while his careful planning allowed him to carry out the project with extraordinary success , it was not without a few mishaps			0
when he phoned @entity187 , he found his correspondent in total darkness as he had slipped up and called in the middle of the night			0
' that was the hard thing , calculating the different time changes , ' he said			0
mr @entity7 has concluded the project for now - but he still has 31 countries to go , and is considering restarting in order to collect a full set			1
' i might do it , just because i had such an amazing time talking to people , ' he said .			0
