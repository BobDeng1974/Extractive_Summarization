by @entity0 today is the first day of july , @entity1 is still in full flow and the schools have not yet broken up			0
but while we enjoy the pleasures of mid-summer , nature is already racing ahead towards autumn			2
our fields , woodlands and hedgerows are already displaying signs of change they would not usually expect to see until august or september , conservationists say			0
@entity21 could soon be upon us ( file photo ) autumn : scientists say holly berries are ripening , despite being associated with @entity27 ( file photo ) falling silent : blackbirds have already stopped singing earlier than usual , say the experts ( file photo ) after an early spring and summer , plants and animals are well ahead of the seasons			1
@entity35 berries are already turning red , holly berries are ripening , and beech and hazel nuts are developing months ahead of schedule			1
@entity41 naturalist @entity40 said : ' looking at this year , where does it want to be ? it raged its way through winter , then we went into an incredibly early spring , and then it rushed helter - skelter through spring without stopping for breath			1
' this year blackbirds have already stopped singing , butterflies such as purple emperors arrived a month early and bees have been thriving on nectar from early flowers			1
our remarkably mild weather over the last few months seems to have accelerated the seasons			1
each of the last seven months has seen warmer - than - average temperatures , according to the @entity61			1
@entity18 had the third hottest spring since records began , three months of warm temperatures which triggered the flourishing of plants and wildlife			1
the @entity61 said each of the last seven months has seen warmer - than - average temperatures , with hawthorn and holly berries already ripening			1
pictured : dog walkers on @entity70 in @entity71 yesterday @entity72 2014 has been a great year for bluebells			2
this wood in @entity75 is especially rich this year @entity76 in @entity77 , which hosts a quarter of @entity18 's natterjack toad population , is seeing bumper numbers this year ( file picture ) and june has been the sixth warmest since records began in 1910 , around @entity83 above average			2
mr @entity40 said : ' we 're remarkably ahead , birds have largely stopped singing , a lot of butterflies are very early and are still coming out early			2
' there are really strong signs of autumn already here , like the beech nuts , it ' s an amazing beech mast year and the nuts are incredibly well developed			2
' he also said sycamore seeds were well developed and hawthorn and holly berries were already red - changes that usually would not be seen until september			1
the @entity102 said people may begin to see more thrushes , blue tits and sparrows in our hedgerows over the coming weeks as they come to feed on the early berries			1
a spokesman said : ' most birds will be feeding on insects and worms at the moment , and when they run out or the ground gets baked too hard for the birds to get them then they will move on to berries			0
' @entity119 , thrushes , blue tits and sparrows will all eat hawthorn berries and other hedgerow berries but we have n't seen big signs of them making the switch just yet			0
' many plants and animals suffered during the winter storms that blasted @entity18 during december , january and february			2
but the mild weather since has greatly aided their recovery			0
full swing : crowds arrive at @entity1 yesterday			0
it feels like the start of summer , but could it soon be over ? experts say holly berries are ripening , and beech and hazel nuts are developing months ahead of schedule dr @entity145 of the @entity146 said : ' our landscape is incredibly resilient in the face of natural and man - made threats and has responded fantastically since the battering it took over the winter			1
records would suggest summer is in full swing but that autumn is just around the corner			0
' nature is always on the march and in july i 'd encourage people to keep their eyes open for the first signs of autumn such as the first ripe blackberries			0
' mr @entity40 added : ' if we go back to that winter , it was the wettest , stormiest , wildest winter , and very stressful for every living thing , including us , but wildlife seems to have come through it incredibly well			0
' there are always winners and losers			0
at the moment there seem to be far more winners than losers , though we must remember a lot of our wildlife is in a pretty beleaguered state			0
' despite the generally good situation , mr @entity40 raised concerns about low numbers of butterflies such as cabbage whites and the scarcity of bees and many flying insects			0
more positively , some species of insect may be able to fit in an extra brood because they are so far ahead for the year , he said			2
and an early autumn would not spell problems for wildlife , he said , so long as creatures such as squirrels and dormice have the chance to fatten up before winter set in			0
what a difference a few months make ! the @entity199 were flooded for months in a harsh , stormy winter - but each of the last seven months has seen warmer - than - average temperatures battered : the winter storms destroyed many businesses and the railway line in @entity205 , @entity206 ( pictured )			1

after an early spring , plants and animals are well ahead of the seasons
@entity35 berries are already turning red and holly berries are ripening
hazelnuts , sycamore seeds and *beechnuts* are developing ahead of time
bluebells flowered three weeks earlier than last year after a warm spring
each of the last seven months has seen warmer - than - average temperatures
