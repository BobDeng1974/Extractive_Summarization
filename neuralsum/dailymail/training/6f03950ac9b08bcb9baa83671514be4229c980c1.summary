by @entity0 published : 10:33 est , 15 march 2013 updated : 10:44 est , 15 march 2013 a college freshman who ’d avoided nuts for over ten years has died after eating half a cookie made with peanut oil			1
@entity5 had some exciting times ahead			2
he was studying international business , had plans to study abroad in @entity9 , and was on his way home for spring break			0
since the 19 - year - old was 8 , he ’d known he was allergic to peanuts			1
his mother , @entity15 , told @entity16 her was asthmatic and discovered in high school he was allergic to all after tossing his inhaler into a pile of acorns			2
one he , nonetheless , recovered from with prompt treatment			0
last friday , @entity5 had been home just two hours in @entity39 , @entity40 from @entity41 in @entity42			0
spring break had just begun and he and a friend were out driving and bought some cookies			2
according to @entity15 , her son ’s friend was the first to try the cookies and promised @entity5 he tasted no trace of peanuts			1
@entity51 plans : the freshman at @entity42 's @entity41 majored in international business and was planning to study abroad in @entity9 the friend would later recall @entity5 saying , ‘ ah , the hell with it , i 'm sure it 's fine			1
’ minutes later , he was anything but fine			0
with him doubled over in pain and turning black and blue , @entity15 scrambled to find son ’s @entity28 in his still - packed bags as he yelled ‘ i ca n’t breathe ! ’ unable to locate it , @entity15 found one of the life - saving epinephrine auto - injectors she still kept at her home			1
but her @entity28 was expired by two months and , though her son ’s condition was quickly deteriorating , emergency operators on the phone told @entity15 not to use the medication			1
a doctor would later tell the shell - shocked mother she should have used the expired @entity28 , though it may not have worked			1
hard to detect : @entity5 's friend tried the cookie first and tasted no peanuts , but peanut oil is more mild and ca n't always be tasted a firefighter neighbor would soon bring over his own @entity28 to administer to @entity5 and 15 emergency workers would perform cpr on the teenager for two hours when he was finally taken to the hospital			1
however , it was of no use			0
‘ i was begging so much , ’ @entity15 said , ‘ these people were crying and working on him , thinking , “ we 're only doing this for the mother			2
” ’ a tearful @entity15 told @entity16 her son had big plans in life and made a bucket list at age 9			0
" he always wanted to do something big , " @entity15 said			0
@entity5 was a registered organ donor , so at least one wish from that years - old list will be fulfilled			2
his desire to one day save a life			0
