by @entity0 published : 17:41 est , 17 september 2013 updated : 11:14 est , 18 september 2013 in her role as a high - powered @entity4 lawyer , @entity1 does not often get the chance to play the everyday school mum			0
so it is little wonder she ended up looking surprisingly glamorous on a visit to a primary school yesterday – no doubt to the despair of regular mums everywhere			0
the deputy prime minister ’s wife lit up the playground as she sashayed into @entity17 in @entity18 flicking a perfectly coiffed mane and flashing a bright smile			1
but perhaps the excitement of such an unusual occasion was too much for the mother - of - three			1
she was pictured pulling an array of astonishing expressions as she joined in a class promoting healthy eating with the @entity40 school ’s pupils and her husband @entity41			2
yikes ! @entity1 appears fearful for her spotless white top as a pupil reaches for some food pulling faces : perhaps the excitement of such an unusual occasion was too much for the mother - of - three yippee ! @entity1 looks tempted to start a food fight at the school or maybe it was the sheer relief at taking a break from the @entity54 conference that caused mrs @entity1 to crack up laughing			1
the 45 - year - old sat among the pupils dishing out the strawberries and melons but became goggle - eyed when a little girl reached over to take some from her plate			0

@entity54 leader @entity54 and his wife @entity1 take a break from the party conference special visit : @entity69 , in @entity40 near @entity18 where @entity54 and his wife popped in			2

deputy prime minister *'s* wife lit up the playground when she sashayed into @entity17
visit proved almost too much for the mother - of - three judging by her array of facial expressions
