by @entity0 published : 11:20 est , 27 july 2012 updated : 13:28 est , 27 july 2012 seven years ago it was a decision which would change the face of one part of @entity4 forever			2
the successful bid for the @entity6 in july 2005 initiated a frantic and expensive plan to completely transform @entity8 , east @entity4 into a vast athletics complex capable of hosting the world			0
and as these pictures show , the current @entity12 site has gone from dusty wasteland to gleaming landmark during one of most ambitious building projects ever seen on @entity19 shores			0
run down : the barren wasteland in @entity8 , @entity4 , before building work started on the new @entity22 the very first stage : architect @entity24 with the model of the @entity22 that he designed @entity26 : an aerial image from 2006 shows the scale of the job ahead for @entity12 planners , as they prepared to change the @entity8 skyline by 2012 foundations laid : by 2008 , the giant circular hole for the @entity22 is clearly visible as the first signs of a venue take shape taking shape : in november 2008 , the base of the @entity22 was in place and huge steel structures were in position to form the rest of the arena working progress : the first section of the roof support for the @entity22 is erected in early 2009 towering high : april 2009 , and the form of the @entity22 , with its giant side beams , is beginning to dominate the @entity8 skyline aerial images from 2005 show the extent of the task facing architects , engineers and @entity56 planners , when a huge expanse of land in @entity8 was put aside for the @entity59			1
pictures charting the development of the site show how the facilities and infrastructure have gradually risen from the ground , including the spectacular @entity22 , @entity66 , @entity67 and @entity68			1
even in 2001 , years before @entity4 won the bid , what is now the @entity12 site was a desolate , unloved barren wasteland ripe for redevelopment			1
getting closer : with just over two years to go , this shot from may 2010 shows how the stadium and velodrome are almost completely finished , with attention turning to the surrounding park almost there : in june last year the park was almost completely finished , with extra pathways , tarmac around the stadium and the giant red @entity84 structure the noticeable additions finished article : the now gleaming @entity59 , along with the new basketball arena , velodrome ( both top right ) and athlete 's village ( right ) sits ready to welcome the world ready to shine : the £ 550m @entity22 will be the setting for tonight 's spectacular @entity94 the £ 550 @entity22 can hold 80,000 people , with its makers claiming the arena is the lightest olympic stadium ever built			1
the waved roof of the stunning @entity67 , meanwhile , measures 12,000 square metres - one and a half times bigger than the @entity101 pitch			0
the amount of earth excavated in order the built the swimming and diving arena was the equivalent of 160,000 tonnes of soil			0
burgeoning : the next picture , taken by @entity110 in may 2008 , shows an enormous crater that forms the foundations of the @entity22 what a difference a year makes : the @entity115 stadium , seen bottom left , starts to emerge in the mapping agency 's 2009 picture coming on : by 2010 the stadium was well on its way to being complete			2
the @entity67 is just to the stadium 's right while the @entity66 cycling arena can be seen at the top of the picture changing landscape : the £ 550million olympic stadium gleams next to the £ 105million @entity66 cycling arena , while the @entity130 shopping centre looks over the @entity131 and @entity132 in this picture from last year			0
