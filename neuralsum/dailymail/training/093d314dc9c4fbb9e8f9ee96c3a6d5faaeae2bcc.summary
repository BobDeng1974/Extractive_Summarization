@entity10 praised @entity20 and grumbled about the @entity93 officials who ruled a late goal by @entity25 to be offside and only added two minutes of stoppage time at the end , when he clearly thought he should have been be more			1
generally , the he cut a disgruntled figure and his mood was not enhanced when the travelling fans , offended by his remarks that the @entity22 had been like an ' empty stadium ' during last saturday 's win against @entity109 , started to tease him			0
' cheer up @entity10 , ' they sang , in the first half , and then : ' @entity112 '			2
they left him alone once it was clear the manager was not amused			2
when asked to comment on the songs , he shook his head and said : ' forget it '			0
at the end of the game , he congratulated @entity20 boss @entity121 and then stalked straight down the tunnel as @entity78 led the players to salute the 600 @entity14 supporters who made the trip			1
at half - time , @entity10 had made the same purposeful march across the pitch and into the dressing rooms , staring at the floor with clipboard tucked under his arm like a man about to deliver a few home truths			1
one of his backroom staff emerged moments later , sent to retrieve the electronic board used by the fourth officials to indicate substitutions			0
' in the first half we were not good , ' said @entity10			2
' very slow ; no intensity , no creativity			0
it was easy for @entity20 to control the game and reach what they wanted to reach , a 0 - 0			1
' i tried to improve my team			0
when you try to improve your team , sometimes it 's for tactical reasons			0
other times it 's for individual performances			0
i think i was successful with the changes i did			0
' in the second half the team were much better than in the first half			2
i thought we played magnificently : creative , fast , good dynamic , a lot of chances to score			0
only when @entity20 scored did the players realise the game was in danger			1
after that , a fantastic reaction			0
' we deserved to win , @entity168 did n't reach the number of goals that we should have in the second half , but the team played well			2
and we scored a great second goal			0
' @entity79 ( right ) goes up for a header against @entity66 ( centre ) during wednesday 's clash @entity82 ( left ) squandered a chance for the @entity177 in the first half against their @entity49 opponents the @entity182 international falls in a heap during the first half but is able to carry on for @entity10 's side @entity41 midfielder hazard ( left ) winces after he is tackled by @entity20 defender @entity55 at the @entity187 no @entity189 side won a single group match this week , the first time that happened since november 5 , 2008			1
the ' second goal ' was a reference to the disallowed goal prodded in by @entity25 moments before @entity33 's 85th - minute penalty miss. it looked very tight , perhaps marginally onside , and he did not miss the chance to take a swipe at referee @entity92			1
they have history stretching back to @entity10 's time with @entity203			0
' we scored two goals , two very good goals , ' said the @entity14 boss			1
' the second goal , the referee decided to disallow but it 's a clear goal			0

and the referee 's team did n't have a good night			0
' @entity10 's frustration grows as his @entity14 side fail to break down their @entity49 opponents in the first half travelling @entity14 fans rally behind their team in @entity49 as they try to strengthen their grip on @entity228 on wednesday night @entity20 's @entity59 ( right ) broke the deadlock with a beautiful left - footed shot that curled into top corner @entity59 ( centre ) celebrates his strike to give @entity20 a shock second half lead against @entity228 leaders @entity14 perhaps it had all felt a little too comfortable because , after scoring six against the @entity49 in @entity238			1
the @entity240 leaders started well , creating chances and missing them until @entity77 was forced to clear off the goal - line from @entity62			2
@entity243 washed through the home team and they passed the ball with more assurance			2
@entity62 caused problems with his pace and trickery and @entity59 's goal was a delicious piece of skill , curled into the top corner with his left foot from wide on the @entity20 right past @entity75			1
it was the first time @entity14 had been behind since september 13 against @entity256			1
@entity10 made his third substitution and switched to a three - man defence , with hazard at wing - back			0
@entity20 ought to have doubled the lead when @entity58 's cross from the left found @entity64 at the far post			1
the teenager only had to tap it in , but somehow lifted it over the goal			0
here was an escape for @entity14 , and they took advantage by summoning a strong finish			1
the leveller came from @entity79 with 17 minutes left after @entity78 had headed a corner from @entity50 towards goal			1
@entity33 came to life but could not find a finish and @entity25 was denied , and that goal that never was			2
@entity26 thought he might have won a penalty and yet @entity20 could have won it when @entity66 fired wide after a break by @entity62			1
@entity79 ( right ) tapped home from close range in the 73rd minute to cancel out @entity20 's opener @entity79 ( left ) celebrates his equaliser for @entity14 against @entity20 in wednesday 's @entity54 tie hazard ( right ) missed a glorious chance before his penalty miss to put @entity14 ahead but saw his shot saved when through on goal amid the chaotic closing spell , @entity33 was tripped by @entity58 , climbed to his feet and saw his spot - kick saved by @entity39			1
it summed the night up			0
@entity20 clung on and the home crowd could barely contain their joy , chanting , jumping , burning flares and waving their giant flags			1
at the end they did not want to leave			0
they have never seen anything like it			0
for @entity14 , as the dust settled , it did not seem quite so bad			2
they remain top of @entity228 , in a good position to qualify and remain unbeaten in 16 games this season in all competitions			0
next in @entity308 , they meet @entity310 's @entity309 , but first to @entity312 where the atmosphere will surely be right up @entity10 's street			2
@entity33 was one of @entity315 @entity10 will be frustrated with his side 's efforts in @entity49 after being held to a 1 - 1 draw at @entity20			1

@entity59 put @entity20 ahead in the second half with a *majestic* left - footed curled shot into the top corner
@entity79 equalised for @entity14 with tapping home from a @entity78 header in the 73rd minute
@entity33 had a penalty saved late on for the *visitors* as they were held to a draw in @entity49
