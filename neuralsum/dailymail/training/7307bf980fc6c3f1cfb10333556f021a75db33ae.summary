by @entity0 @entity1 rounded off a good week 's work with a comfortable 4 - 1 win over @entity4 - taking their tally of goals to 12 in the process			1
first - half goals from @entity9 and @entity10 set @entity1 up for another home win on the back of monday 's 8 - 1 hammering of @entity14			1
and although it was a gutsy performance from @entity4 , a second - half strike from @entity17 and an own goal from @entity19 left @entity21 's side on the wrong of another crushing defeat - with only a @entity25 own goal for consolation			1
opener : @entity9 celebrates scoring the opener against @entity4 @entity4 made a confident start and provided an early threat on the home goal			1
after three minutes @entity33 , in his first league start , made the first save of the game getting down to smother an effort from @entity37			0
@entity1 first chance to test the visitors ' goalkeeper arrived after 10 minutes from a free - kick on the right of the penalty area			0
but with plenty of height in the box , @entity44 elected to play a low ball which was easily cleared by the @entity50 ' defence			0
four minutes later @entity44 made amends when his perfect delivery from a corner was met on the volley by @entity9 and from six yards the ball flew high past @entity55 to make it 1 - 0			0
in front : @entity9 ( left ) scores in the first half to put @entity1 in the lead against @entity4 at @entity61 @entity1 came within inches of doubling their lead two minutes later but @entity44 watched his 30 - yard drive rebound from the foot of the post			1
after 20 minutes the other post was rattled			0
@entity10 's long throw was nodded back by @entity69 , allowing @entity17 to swivel before slamming his shot off the upright with the goalkeeper well beaten			2
nine minutes later , though , the @entity4 goalkeeper was beaten again when @entity10 raced into the box on the right before unleashing a powerful angled drive high into the net			2
having been largely idle since the opening spell , seven minutes from the break @entity33 was forced into a fine save diving low to his left to push away an angled drive from @entity37			0
a minute later the @entity1 goalkeeper made another good stop , blocking @entity19 's downward header - although he was in an offside position			1
good week : @entity86 's @entity1 side won twice this week , scoring 12 goals in the process the first - half ended with @entity55 the busier goalkeeper , producing a couple of saves from @entity93 and @entity94			1
three minutes after the break a brilliant piece of skill from law set - up a half - volley towards to top corner but @entity55 matched it with a superb one - handed save			2
the goalkeeper had no chance in the 53rd minute when @entity1 made it 3 - 0			0
@entity69 broke into the box and then unselfishly rolled the ball in front of @entity17 who had the simple task of sliding the ball home from 10 yards			0
@entity44 , having made a significant contribution , was then replaced along with @entity111 as @entity112 and @entity113 came on			0
goal : @entity17 scores for @entity1 in their championship match against @entity4 and within two minutes @entity113 made his own contribution , whipping in a corner which was missed by the goalkeeper leaving the ball to rebound off @entity19 's face and into his own net			1
injury was added to insult and while the @entity50 defender was off the pitch receiving treatment , @entity1 had the ball in the net again but @entity69 's header was ruled out for offside			0
@entity4 finally got their consolation goal 10 minutes from time when @entity25 headed @entity136 's curling cross beyond his own goalkeeper			1
despite losing four goals , @entity55 capped a fine afternoon with another impressive save to deny @entity17 a fifth for @entity1 .			2

@entity9 opened the scoring for @entity1
@entity10 added a second for the hosts before half - time
