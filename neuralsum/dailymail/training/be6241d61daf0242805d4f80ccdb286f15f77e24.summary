yesterday , i washed down the turkey with a glass of donkey milk			1
after all , it ’s a perfect festive drink — no @entity6 scene is complete without a donkey looking over @entity8 in his manger			2
and the flavour was surprisingly pleasant , although i expected more of a kick			2
it was reassuringly odourless , and looked and tasted just like skimmed cow ’s milk , although a tad sweeter			1
but the real reason i downed the stuff is that , to some , it ’s a veritable elixir			0
hailed by the ancients as a cure for a variety of ailments and an anti-ageing skin tonic , donkey milk is enjoying a revival			1
and its popularity is likely only to grow further after @entity27 this month revealed he was fed it as a baby in @entity31 to supplement his mother ’s milk			1
flawless : @entity35 , as @entity36 , bathing in asses ' milk @entity39 is already a convert to its benefits			1
as the owner of @entity44 ’s biggest farm producing the milk , he drinks it daily in its fresh , unpasteurised form			1
at 54 , he ’s only a year younger than me , but looks stronger and more youthful			0
‘ @entity51 ’s milk is a serious product , ’ he assures me			1
certainly , scientists are becoming increasingly interested in it			0
the milk ’s medicinal virtues were first heralded by the ancient @entity58 physician @entity57 , who recommended it to combat a host of bodily woes , including liver problems , fevers , infectious diseases , poisoning , joint pains and nose bleeds			1
the @entity68 later added constipation to that list			0
the use of donkey milk as a moisturiser in cosmetics is even more fabled , thanks to @entity36			1
the @entity77 queen took a daily bath in it , with a steady stream of milk supplied by more than 700 lactating asses			1
the stuff ‘ erases facial wrinkles , makes the skin more delicate and maintains the whiteness ’ , enthused @entity87 , an ancient @entity68 know - it - all			1
of course , people have drunk it as part of their daily diet , too : fresh donkey milk was widely available in 19th - century @entity94 as an alternative to the highly adulterated cows ’ milk sold by dairies			1
now , with more and more people looking to avoid cow ’s milk products because of dairy allergies , interest in alternatives is growing			1
could donkey milk repeat the success of goat and sheep milk and , more recently , camel milk ? as it ’s rich in lactose — a type of sugar — and low in fat , donkey milk is the closest animal milk to the human variety			1
its nutritional properties may make it more suitable for the ‘ 2 to 6 per cent of the population ’ who are allergic to cow milk , according to a @entity125 study			1
d onkey milk is also vitamin - rich and contains anti-bacterial proteins and anti-allergens — substances that regulate the immune system , countering allergic reactions — reputed to alleviate skin conditions such as psoriasis and eczema , as well as asthma and bronchitis			1
i first learned of the milk ’s reputation last month when , amused to see bars of donkey milk soap , liqueur , chocolate and cosmetics in a @entity44 gift shop , i asked if they were meant as joke presents			1
the assistant soon set me straight			0
i was particularly intrigued by her account of a @entity151 customer who snapped up 15 bars of the soap , declaring they were the best relief for his psoriasis , an irritating skin condition			1
@entity27 , pictured as he is presented two young donkey foals and some donkey milk at the maternity unit at the @entity162 's paediatric hospital , revealed he was fed donkey milk as a baby every few months for the past 15 years the skin under my beard and eyebrows has become red , itchy and flaky			1
i suspect it ’s psoriasis but have never had it properly diagnosed — i usually manage to get rid of it in a few days with a cream applied topically			0
this year , though , the itchiness has returned more aggressively			0
the shop assistant directed me to her supplier : @entity39 at his @entity175 in the hilly village of @entity177			0
home to 200 of the animals , the farm is proving a hit with both health - conscious holidaymakers and locals , many of whom remember their grandmother ’s tales about the benefits of supping donkey milk			1
i see two elderly but sprightly - looking nuns sporting sunglasses in the farm ’s gift shop snapping up several bottles of fresh donkey milk ( but , @entity197 bless them , no donkey milk liqueur )			1
they ’re regulars , according to @entity199 , getting the weekly supply for their community			0
‘ drinking the milk is the best way to get the benefits of its antibiotic properties , ’ he says			1
and he ’s not asking people to take him on faith			0
to get a scientific stamp of approval , he has called the @entity212 in @entity213 to oversee his work			0
dr @entity215 , a lecturer in dairy science , has been interviewing people who ’ve been drinking milk from the farm regularly over a period of two to three months			1
‘ from what they say , they ’ve had some remarkable results , especially children with asthma or coughs and for some with eczema and psoriasis , ’ says dr @entity215			0
‘ now we ’ll try to get a clinical study going on the adults to see if this milk really is as promising as it looks			1
we know already that traditionally it was used by people just a few generations ago to treat whooping cough in young children			0
’ the science behind the milk ’s therapeutic properties does seem intriguing			1
like humans , donkeys have a single stomach			0
yet we mostly drink the milk of multi-stomached animals such as cows and goats , which use a lot of bacteria to digest their food through a complicated fermentation process			1
donkey milk is not only very close to human milk in composition but contains protective anti-bacterial agents — one of which ‘ seems to be maybe 200 times more active than in cow ’s milk ’ , says dr @entity215			1
this might explain why donkey ’s milk appears to be particularly free of germs			1
‘ as a scientist i ’m always cautious , but this milk looks promising , ’ he says			2
so , why are n’t we all drinking donkey milk already ? at € 24 ( £ 19 ) a litre in @entity44 it does n’t come cheap , and the average price in other countries is twice that			2
in @entity272 , it ’s produced in @entity273 , @entity274 , @entity275 , @entity276 , @entity277 , @entity278 and @entity279 ; far more is produced in @entity281 countries			0
two years ago , there were reports tennis ace @entity283 had bought up his country ’s entire supply of donkey milk for a chain of restaurants he ’d opened in @entity278 the problem is a jenny — a female donkey — produces just a litre of milk a day for six to seven months a year , while a cow can deliver 30 times as much			2
also , a donkey wo n’t produce milk unless it ’s stimulated by the presence of its foal , and milking has to be done manually			2
but only a little is needed to feel the benefits , according to @entity199 , he recommends drinking just 60ml a day — ‘ all you need to protect your body ’			0
he also uses donkey milk to make an unusual liqueur , which looks and tastes like @entity308 , but is n’t quite as creamy			2
@entity310 aficionados can buy donkey milk and products such as soaps , moisturisers , creams , shower gels and body lotions online			2
@entity318 , the company that recently gave the @entity27 a couple of donkeys , is one supplier ( eurolactis.com )			1
and a @entity322 chef is already testing recipes with donkey cheese			0
‘ when you add in sugar and chocolate , in particular , the taste is amazing , ’ @entity329 told @entity331 magazine			0
he ’s working on an ‘ emulsion of donkey ’s milk and wild flowers to complement a poached lobster ’			2
@entity199 has no intention of turning his precious milk to cheese , however			2
‘ @entity51 milk has virtually no fat — just 0.5 per cent — so you ’d need 100 kilos of it to make one kilo of cheese , ’ he explains			2
‘ imagine how much you ’d have to sell it for			0
in @entity278 it costs € 1,000 ( £ 800 ) a kilo			0
’ indeed , the crumbly white cheese is a coveted @entity351 delicacy , known as pule			0
two years ago , there were reports that tennis ace @entity283 had bought up his country ’s entire supply for a chain of restaurants he ’d opened in his homeland			0
he denied the claims , but it ’s nice to think donkey milk might be the secret of his sporting success			2
@entity365 should give it a try			0
back in @entity177 , @entity199 loads with me presents : a bottle of the donkey milk liqueur , a tin of his extra virgin olive oil , which contains aromatic basil grown on the farm , and some delicious chocolate containing pasteurised donkey milk that tastes like @entity378			2
but i ’m most chuffed by the two bars of donkey milk soap that he pops in my gift bag			2
back home i lather it on — the itchiness under my beard goes within an hour			0
three weeks on there ’s no recurrence			0
the milk ’s benefits may not yet be clinically proven , but i ’m a convert			2
my brother , a fellow sceptic , is also braying with delight			0
the eczema on his hands has cleared up after a week			0
‘ this soap seems to be doing the trick , ’ he says			0
‘ is it coincidence ? i ’ll keep using it to see			0
’ i just hope those nuns do n’t buy up the entire stock .			0
