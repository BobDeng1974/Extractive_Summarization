by @entity1 reporter published : 15:03 est , 12 may 2013 updated : 15:05 est , 12 may 2013 wildlife workers in a remote @entity4 beauty spot were horrified to discover an injured white goose had been shot with a crossbow bolt			1

despicable : an injured goose is seen to by vets after an unknown person shoots them with a crossbow bolt mr @entity13 said : ' [ the goose ] was still swimming			1
we managed to net it after about ten minutes and get it aboard			0
it did n't put up much of a fight as by then it was so worn out			0
its partner was naturally not very happy and after the injured goose was taken away by the @entity15 it kept honking , calling for its mate , for about three hours afterwards			1
i 've been doing this job for five years and thankfully incidents like this are very rare occurrences			0
' @entity40 , countryside manager for @entity10 , said : ' it is disgraceful behaviour to do something like this to a wild animal			1
i just do n't understand why anyone would want to			0
perhaps they wanted it for their dinner but to carry around and use a crossbow in this manner is deplorable			1
' the goose was taken by mr @entity14 to @entity53 in the nearby village of @entity55			2
@entity56 who treated the animal said : ' the arrow went through its body just behind the legs and the tip came out the other side , just missing its ribcage and the vital organs			1

' the goose was returned to the @entity15 where it is now recovering at the @entity72 in @entity73 , @entity74			2
