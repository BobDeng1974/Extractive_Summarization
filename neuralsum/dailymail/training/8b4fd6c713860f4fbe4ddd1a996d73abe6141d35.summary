scientists have discovered evidence of 2,300 - year - old surgical procedure on two ancient skulls			2
the skulls , unearthed in the @entity5 of @entity6 , belonged to the @entity8 nomadic tribe and showed clear signs of recovery after brain surgery			1
using similar tools and techniques , scientists now plan to recreate the same , high - risk procedure - albeit on skulls of the dead			1
the skulls , unearthed in the @entity5 of @entity6 , belonged to the @entity8 nomadic tribe and showed clear signs of recovery after brain surgery			1
the skulls showed clear evidence of recovery after undergoing the process called ' trepanation '			1
it belonged to a man believed to be 40 to 45 - years - old at the time of death the skulls showed clear evidence of recovery after undergoing the process called ' trepanation ' , according to a report in the @entity30			1
@entity31 was a risky ancient medical procedure which involved drilling a hole , or surgically scraping into a human skull			1
it was used , among other things , to relieve brain swelling , and historians believe it may also have been mistakenly used to treat problems with the nervous system			0
one of the skulls , which belonged to a man aged 40 to 45 , showed signs of suffering a trauma to the head			1
scientists believe he developed a subdural haematoma , a condition where blood forms between the skull and the surface of the brain			0
30 - year - old woman 's skull from @entity55 shows that she died during the surgery or soon afterwards the @entity8 people were part of an @entity60 archaeological culture in the 6th to 3rd centuries @entity62 @entity61 archaeological culture belongs to the steppe archeological category , which is sometimes named ‘ @entity65 ’			2
their remains have been found in the @entity6 permafrost in the @entity5 and nearby @entity68			2
as well as their belongings , their bodies have preserved some of the best ancient tattoos ever seen in the world			0
they were believed to be skilled surgeons and had knowledge of the @entity77 , a set of ancient @entity80 medical texts the haematoma would have led to him suffering headaches , vomiting and movement problems in his right leg and hand			0
@entity31 would have removed the haematoma and evidence of later bone growth suggests the man lived for years after the surgery			0
the second male had a hereditary deformation , which was successfully improved with by drilling a hole into the skull			0
' in the middle 19th century , the survival of patients after trepanation in the best hospitals in @entity103 rarely exceed 10 per cent , ' @entity96 of the @entity97 of @entity98 told @entity30			0
@entity31 was a high - risk ancient medical procedure which involved drilling a hole , or surgically scraping into a human skull			1
pictured is the second male , who had a hereditary deformation of the skull scientists have now created computer models of the two skulls , along with a third skull found of a woman in which the procedure was unsuccessful ' [ @entity31 ] was associated with an extremely high risk of infectious complications , and this operation was committed only when patients had very severe traumatic brain injury			1
' ' even today , with advanced neurosurgical techniques , successful implementation of trepanation requires the serious knowledge and training , and the procedure itself is not considered as absolutely harmless			0
' archaeologists believe the @entity8 tribe may have had knowledge of the @entity77 , a set of ancient @entity80 medical texts associated with the physician @entity134			2
they claim results of the ancient operations on these two skulls to be ' astonishing ' given the risks associated with such surgery			0
scientists have now created computer models of the two skulls , along with a third skull found of a woman in which the procedure was unsuccessful			2
the 30 - year - old woman 's skull indicated injury consistent with a fall , and further analysis suggests she died during the surgery or soon afterwards			0
by recreating the procedure , scientists at the @entity96 and @entity151 hope to understand more which tools were used , and why the procedure was carried out			0
' it may have been related to the rituals through which man reached altered states of consciousness required for religious and magical activities , ' they say			1
the @entity5 , where the skulls were found , are a mountain range in @entity162 , where @entity163 , @entity164 , @entity68 and @entity165 come together			2

skulls were found in @entity5 and belonged to @entity8 tribe
they showed signs of recovery after a process called ' trepanation '
this involved drilling a hole or surgically scraping into a human skull
using similar tools , scientists will recreate surgery on skulls of dead
' [ the surgery ] may have been related to the rituals through which man reached altered states of consciousness , ' the scientists claim
