to play darts at the @entity1 you have to throw from outside the front door , but there 's no room for such games here , where beer is taken seriously and space is at a premium			0
the humble little watering hole , at 68 square feet , is one of the smallest in the country and can be found in deepest @entity13 between @entity14 and @entity15			1
it has been named in the @entity17 for the third consecutive year , not bad for its five - year history after it opened as an offshoot of the @entity22			0
pint - sized : the @entity1 in @entity13 can fit no more than 17 people inside at any one time patience required : the pub , despite its size , has been named in @entity28 's @entity17 for the third year the farm 's former milking parlour , the @entity31 can fit just 17 people inside with a single bar tender manning the eight foot - wide bar			1
while it is open year - round , the @entity31 does its best business in the warmer months when locals and visitors can spill into the outside area			0
up to 80 drinkers can be found at the pub at one time , a stretch for the sole staff member , but they have a fine solution for that too - a communal self - service tap away from the bar for those unwilling to wait to be served , with an honesty box system for payment			2
@entity49 , who helps run the piddly pub under brewery owner and landlord @entity52 , said the eight foot - square room was initially set up as a tasting room			0
room for one : pub landlord and brewery owner @entity52 behind the bar with space for just one tender ' after the brewery was set up in 2009 we converted a tiny eight - foot square corner of the old milking parlour into a little room for sampling our beers but it quickly became popular with locals and visitors further afield , ' @entity49 said			2
' people started coming to the tasting room to enjoy a few pints and within just a few months it had transformed into a micropub in its own right			0
' like all great pubs it has a friendly , welcoming atmosphere and sublime beers on tap but we just ca n't fit any more than 17 people inside			1
' the pub is only 68 square feet which makes us one of the smallest pubs in the world and probably the smallest in @entity82			1
' spilling over : when the inside of the pub is jammed , or if it 's a nice day , up to 80 people fit into the outside area a number of establishments would dispute that claim			2
the @entity90 says the smallest pub in @entity82 is @entity92 in @entity93 , @entity94 , which is in fact bigger at 105 square feet but can barely fit 10 people inside at any one time			1
the @entity97 in @entity98 , @entity99 , is 64 square feet and lays claim to being the ' smallest pub on the planet '			1
but it is merely a seasonal bar attached to a heritage steam railway rather than a 12 months - a - year operation with regular opening hours like the tap			0
farm watering hole : the pub , opened in 2009 along with the @entity22 , is on a former dairy farm there 's no inferiority complex for the tap when it comes to size though			1
@entity49 adds : ' being so small works in our favour because it creates an electric atmosphere			0
' we have just been listed by @entity28 's @entity17 which is testament to the quality of the beer and the popularity of the pub. ' we have the sort of atmosphere and clientele that many a local pub would die for			0

the @entity31 can fit just 17 people inside and has one bar tender
the pub can be found between @entity14 and @entity135 in @entity13
it sells beer exclusively from the *adjoining* @entity22
it is *arguably* the smallest pub in @entity82 in size at just 68 square feet
the brewery and pub are built on a former dairy farm
the tap has made the @entity149 in 2013 , 2014 and 2015
