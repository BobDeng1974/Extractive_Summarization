by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 _ at the beginning of his friday morning pre-match press conferences , @entity3 manager @entity2 habitually ticks off his injury list			2
last season , it often went something like this			0
‘ @entity11 , @entity12 , @entity13 , @entity14			0
’ a voice would then pop up from the assembled press : ‘ and @entity17 ? ’ ‘ yes , @entity17 , i ’m not sure , maybe a couple of weeks			2
’ hit and miss : @entity3 's @entity17 is looking to impress after struggling last season this , sadly , was the narrative of @entity17 ’s first season in @entity22 , the £ 22.4million signing from @entity24 seeing his campaign punctuated by a series of muscle of injuries with a return date often hazy			1
it all began with a hamstring problem suffered in pre-season and then came subsequent problems of a similar kind , along with calf strains and groin problems , limiting @entity17 to just two @entity37 starts			1
in public , @entity2 pleaded for tolerance but behind the scenes , @entity3 could have been forgiven for wondering whether it was a psychological battle as well as a physical one for @entity17			1
certainly , the @entity43 was unlucky			0
on one scheduled return date in a @entity47 match at @entity48 , he was struck down by a bout of food poisoning			0
frustrated figure : @entity17 just made five starts last season in all competitions due to injuries and illness welcome sight : @entity17 's ( left ) struggles were to the chagrin of city manager @entity2 ( right ) nonetheless , when @entity14 suffered a series of set - backs in the second half of the season , and @entity64 dramatically lost his gloascoring touch , it was @entity66 that emerged from the shadows , with @entity69 worthy only of seven substitute appearances between the end of february and may			1
evidently , the @entity43 has a way to go to regain the trust of @entity2			0
the manager ’s apparent reservations are understandable			0
to strip @entity17 ’s career at @entity3 down to the bare numbers , it makes for uncomfortable reading			1
so far , @entity17 has played just 579 minutes in the light blue of @entity3			1
that works out at £ 38,687 per minute			0
he is yet to play more than 65 minutes in a single @entity37 game			0
the only 90 minutes he did complete came in a 5 - 0 victory over @entity84 in the @entity47			1
@entity17 started just five games in all competitions last season			1
for the record , that works out at £ 4.48m per game			0
unreliable ? @entity17 ( centre ) made seven substitute appearances for @entity3 between february and may in one match against @entity94 , he came on in the 56th minute and limped off after 69 minutes			2
in another at @entity95 , he managed just 10 minutes before succumbing to injury			0
in @entity98 , they nicknamed him @entity17 and times last season , some @entity3 fans may have feared that his time at the @entity101 would end up as inauspicious as that of the @entity103 @entity17 , the former club record signing that scored just six goals for the club			1
yet when several @entity98 clubs came calling for @entity17 this summer , principally @entity108 , @entity3 rejected the approaches without a second ’s hesitation			2
still got it : @entity17 ( left ) scored twice for @entity3 in their 5 - 1 pre-season friendly win against @entity114 on sunday @entity115 delighted at rampant city and on sunday evening in the @entity117 , @entity17 reminded everybody just why sporting director @entity119 and @entity2 were so keen to retain him			1
albeit only pre-season and against an @entity114 team who appeared to be taking their inspiration for defending from @entity103 ’s @entity125 side , @entity17 dazzled , scoring twice and it would have been three if not for the linesman ’s offside flag			1
speaking before the game , @entity2 said : ‘ @entity17 is working well with us			0
he is a very important player for our team			0
maybe there are a lot of rumours about his future but @entity17 will stay with us			0
’ still only 24 , @entity3 believe they have one of the world ’s most talented forwards on their books and they hope that their perseverance will be rewarded with the kind of performances that saw @entity17 compared to @entity144 and @entity145 in @entity98 and named as @entity147 ’s youngest ever captain , aged 18 , just a few years ago			2
if , and it remains a significant if , @entity17 is able to stay fit , @entity3 ’s patience could yet be repaid in spectacular fashion			2
talent : despite a disappointing last season , @entity3 believe @entity17 ( right ) is one of the world 's best forwards @entity154 performer : @entity17 won man - of - the - match for his two - goal display against @entity108 on sunday			1

@entity17 suffered a disappointing debut season at @entity3
@entity17 *joined* @entity3 for £ 22.4million from @entity24 last year but managed to start only five games in all competitions due to injuries and illness
@entity17 looks sharp in pre-season , scoring twice against @entity114 in @entity3 's 5 - 1 win on sunday
