by @entity0 students at a @entity2 , @entity4 high school were shocked when they opened their yearbooks to find they 'd been censored with black tape stuck hastily over students ' messages			1
administrators undertook the massive , and some say misguided , task of covering up with tape the messages left by ten @entity15 seniors in every yearbook sold to the school of 1,300 students because they were deemed ' racist or unacceptable			1
' but were they , really ? some schoolboard members are now demanding answers to why innocuous comments like ' come getcha some , ' which merely referenced a reality series on @entity25 , are among the comments covered with damaging , sticky tape in every single $ 75 keepsake			1
censored : students at @entity30 in @entity2 , @entity4 were shocked when the received their yearbooks and found they 'd been censored by administrators using hastily stuck on duct tape ' we do n’t know what the school administration was thinking but this does not seem fair to the seniors of @entity30 , ' boardmember @entity34 told the @entity41			2
people like @entity34 are questioning the censoring of seemingly innocuous , if unintelligible messages , such as : ' come getcha some – @entity45			0
' too late : by the time administrators taped over the messages and the $ 75 yearbooks were finally doled out to students , the school year had ended and they were unable to write each goodbye messages others were more understandable , though far from shocking in their racial content			1
' every @entity54 needs a white best friend , ' said one @entity57 student before her words were obscured			1
' they paid $ 75 for a book and they put tape all over it			2
nothing i have read warrants what they have done			0
i think the district should apologize or give the kids			0
' the tape could also be damaging to the yearbooks if removed			0
and by the time students received the yearbooks , which were withheld after printing in order for them to be censored , school as out and they could n't sign each others ' pages			2
' the students got less than what they paid for , and they got it very late and missed the opportunity for inscriptions that is a big part of what makes the yearbook meaningful , ' complained @entity88 , another boardmember			2
perhaps most importantly , if the comments in question were deemed inappropriate , both @entity88 and @entity34 agree that administrators should have dealt with them prior to printing			0
' the principal should have reviewed this before it went to the printer			0
if it offends his sensibilities for whatever reason , those reasons should be articulated to the students , and adults should have talked to them about their objections beforehand , ' said @entity34			0
culprits ? administrators said the censored comments were ' racist and unacceptable ' but would not elaborate			0
one @entity57 student wrote ' every @entity54 needs a white best friend , ' and was censored			1
less understandable was the boy at right 's comment , ' come getcha some ! -- @entity114 , ' which is an innocuous reference to the @entity25 reality series @entity116			1

administrators at @entity15 in @entity2 , @entity4 taped over 10 comments in every $ 75 yearbook sold at the school of 1,300 students
some of the comments mentioned race , but many did not appear at all *offensive* to a *casual* *observer* , like one that referenced an @entity25 reality series
one @entity57 student wrote , ' every @entity54 needs a white best friend '
