@entity0 takes his courage in both fists as he enters the ring in @entity4 this saturday night to confront the most concussive pound - for - pound puncher in the world			1
@entity7 will greet him with a handshake and a smile , followed by flurries of the blows which have knocked out 28 of the 31 victims in his unbeaten professional career			1
call it fearless vs @entity16			0
@entity0 ( right ) faces the toughest challenge of his career against @entity7 on saturday @entity0 has vowed to give the fight his best shot despite being rated as a 25 - 1 underdog @entity0 and @entity7 looked confident as they made the weight ahead of their world title bout in @entity26 @entity0 : @entity27 @entity7 : @entity28 ( weight limit : 160lb ) @entity0 declares himself ‘ unafraid of being hurt ’ by the iron - fisted @entity33 and insists he has perceived ‘ chinks in @entity7 ’s armour which i can exploit to upset the odds			1
’ if he does , the casinos in the principality will be paying out at 25 - 1			1
@entity7 talks respectfully of our reformed ex-prisoner as ‘ a strong fighter who brings my toughest test so far ’ but still believes ‘ i will end it inside the 12 rounds			2
’ if he does , @entity0 will be stopped for the first time in a career in which he has yet to be sent to the canvas			0
not even the only two men to deny @entity0 victory managed that in his two previous , close - run , world middleweight title challenges			1
@entity49 was given the benefit of a home - town draw in @entity52 , @entity48 declared a disputed winner in @entity54			0
@entity7 , however , is a more intimidating proposition than either of them			0
he not only hits like a steam - hammer to head and body but employs speed , mobility and a profound depth of ring cunning to create the openings for those punches			0
the @entity33 is unbeaten in 31 bouts , winning 28 by knockout - including against @entity69 ( above ) @entity70 born @entity0 ( right ) has never been knocked to the canvas in his 31 fights name @entity74 born @entity75 , @entity33 , 8 april , 1982 @entity70 , @entity76 , 27 september , 1982 residence @entity78 , @entity52 @entity70 turned pro 6 may , 2006 22 september , 2007 titles won @entity84 / @entity83 middleweight @entity76 & @entity85 middleweight pro record 31 fights , 31 wins ( 28 @entity89 ) 31 fights , 29 wins ( 12 @entity89 ) , 1 loss , 1 draw @entity7 sets more traps than a pest control agency and , in professional terms , the consequences can be just as fatal			1
the careers of several previously unbeaten challengers for his @entity101 world title have either been ended instantly by his blows or petered away into premature retirement a few fights later			1
@entity105 is expected to be in attendance in the plush ballroom in @entity26 , supporting the man from @entity70 in the hope that he can deliver a miracle			0
some of @entity0 ’s domestic peers are making persuasive cases for @entity0 pushing @entity7 to the limit			1
@entity114 , who was destroyed by a @entity116 - force body shot , says : ‘ i ’m sure @entity0 will give a very good account of himself			2
’ @entity119 , who could find himself on @entity7 ’s dance card in the future , says : ‘ @entity0 is not only tough but a clever fighter and i do n’t expect it to be easy for @entity7			1
’ but neither goes so far as to predict a @entity76 upset			0
@entity0 's manager @entity126 is confident his charge will win after posting his bets on @entity129 @entity130 star @entity105 is expected to be cheering @entity0 on from ringside at the @entity132 @entity0 has modified his initial bravado - ‘ i ’m going to knock his head off ’ - by saying : ‘ i have given everything humanly possible in training camp			2
i will give my all in the ring			0
i do not want to go home with any regrets about having given anything less than my absolute best			0
’ @entity0 , having turned his entire life around so admirably that his focus is now on his young family , has the strength of physique and will - power to return home with both his dignity and his future as a fighter intact			2
if he rises so spectacularly to the challenge as to rupture @entity7 ’s invincibility , he will have won a gamble of @entity155 proportions in @entity4			0
@entity7 v @entity0 will be televised live on @entity156 from 10 pm this saturday night .			2
