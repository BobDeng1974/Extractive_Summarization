’ the journalist said he previously asked a former @entity80 councillor , now dead , if she was aware of the claims and was told that the teacher was quietly removed from the school after an incident came to the council ’s attention			2
mr @entity0 said his fond memories of his former school spurred him to set up a charity , speakers for schools , which provides talks for children from inspirational people			1
