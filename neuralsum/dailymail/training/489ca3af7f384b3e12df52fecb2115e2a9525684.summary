' she would like her two daughters to know each other and believes it is in their best interests for that to occur			0
' she wants contact and can not understand why she has been prevented - mrs @entity16 she added : ' fundamentally the mother does not understand and can see no reason why she can not see her daughter			2
' she believes that no contact is not in her daughter ’s interests , and is detrimental to her contrary to her and her own @entity143 and respect for family life , and contrary to the interests of her own younger child who is @entity36 ’s half sister			2
' the judge said she had taken the views of the mother and x into account and decided that @entity36 does need protection from her mother			0
the exclusion zone was necessary ' to protect @entity36 from a deliberate or accidental meeting by the mother with her daughter			2
' she said it is there ' to protect @entity36 and to give x some peace of mind , and that is what she needs			0
' she said when the exclusion zone comes to an end in 2017 , there may be a different situation			0
' it may be that @entity36 will have her own views , maybe the mother will have come to a different view about the past			0
' banning ms @entity1 from making further applications over the next three years , she said of x : ' she needs to be able to continue her life with her father , do well at school , she has the 11 - plus coming up , and i hope very much she will do well and get to the school that she wants			1
