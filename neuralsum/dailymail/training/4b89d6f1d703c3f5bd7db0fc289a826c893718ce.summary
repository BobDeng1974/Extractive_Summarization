by @entity0 in @entity2 films , the ‘ odd - couple ’ often manages to muddle through their differences to enjoy happy lives			0
but a new study claims that in real life , couples in which one person is lazy , adopt the standards of the lazier person			0
individuals in so - called mis - matched relationships - where one person has high self - control and the other very little - often become unhealthy and fritter away their life savings , experts said			1
the odd couples : unlike the happy ending of @entity2 film ' knocked up ' - @entity23 and @entity24 as @entity25 and @entity26 are pictured - individuals in mis - matched relationships where one person has high self - control and the other very little , often become unhealthy and fritter away their life savings , experts said the ability to resist anything from an extra slice of cake to a spending splurge is one of the keys to happier living , according to a 2013 study			1
researchers at the @entity40 found that levels of self - control and life satisfaction were inextricably linked after analysing self - report surveys completed by 414 adults			0
instead of agonising over whether to indulge in something , those with strong willpower simply found it easier to make the right choices while those who gave into vices were plagued with regret			0
study co-author @entity53 of the @entity54 , said people with greater self - restraint are , in essence setting themselves up to be happy			0
this is apparently because they learn how to ' avoid problematic desires and conflict			0
' this is rarely a happy outcome in mis - matched relationships such as @entity25 and @entity26 's in the film ‘ knocked up , ’ where opposites attract and one person can be motivated by the other ’s success			2
scientists from the @entity69 at @entity70 found that couples with mis - matched levels of self - control and motivation adopt the same level of indulgence as couples made up of two slackers			1
@entity79 and @entity80 studied a number of married couples and pairs of students to examine self - control decisions of couples with high self - control , couples with low self - control and those made up of one person who is good at exercising self - restraint and one person who gives into temptation easily			0
they looked at the behaviour of the couples in the lab as well as at coffee mornings and in online forums , @entity93 reported			0
the challenge of a mis - match : scientists from the @entity69 at @entity70 found that couples with mis - matched level of self - control and motivation - such as @entity104 and @entity105 from @entity106 - adopt the same level of indulgence as couples made up of two slackers unsurprisingly , the scientists found that couples made up of two people with impressive self - control ate healthy diets , saved money and rarely got into debt and the opposite was true of lazy couples who give into temptation			1
but the joint decisions of mis - matched couples closely resembled those of the lazy couples			2
‘ maintaining the relationship is more important for the high self - control partner than sticking to their guns , ’ said ms @entity79			1
‘ as a result , mixed dyads [ mis - matched couples ] may end up with worse long - term health and financial outcomes than they may expect			2
’ while it might sound like an unhappy outcome for such couples is inevitable , ms @entity79 thinks mis - matched couples can have a @entity2 - style happy ending if high self - control individuals in relationships are aware of their tendencies to give in and the people with low self - control compromise			1
the study revealed that the joint decisions of mis - matched couples closely resembled those of the lazy couples , who often become unhealthy ( illustrated left ) and fritter away their life savings ( stock image right )			1

scientists found that couples with a mis - matched level of self - control adopt the same level of indulgence as couples made up of two slackers
these couples often get *fat* and fritter their savings away
one expert believes this is because maintaining the relationship is more important for the high self - control partner than sticking to their guns
