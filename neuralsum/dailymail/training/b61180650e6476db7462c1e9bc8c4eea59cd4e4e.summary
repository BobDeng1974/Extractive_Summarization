by @entity0 published : 17:13 est , 28 october 2013 updated : 03:41 est , 29 october 2013 with a supermodel daughter , it is natural to assume that @entity3 would be as looks - obsessed as the modelling industry			2
yet when she was diagnosed with breast cancer in her right breast and underwent a mastectomy , @entity8 , 61 , decided against the reconstructive surgery that might have maintained her perfect figure			1
' after what i ’d been through , my looks were n’t important , ’ says @entity8 , who lives in @entity14			1
' when you ’re staring into the chasm between life and death , you put things into perspective and whether i was left with one arm , one eye or one breast , staying alive was what mattered			2
glamorous : @entity25 and mother @entity8 after the latter 's operation ' i did n’t have concerns about reconstructive surgery - that ’s not why i turned it down - but it was unnecessary to me ; my legs are more important to how i feel about my appearance than my breasts - and it was n’t worth the risk , or physical trauma			1
besides , i ’m scared of needles			0
’ eight years after @entity8 ’s diagnosis , she has no regrets - although friends and family are still surprised by it			1
' even now @entity25 rings me up and says , “ mum , why do n’t you have a reconstruction ? ”			2
i think my daughter worries that ’s the reason i ’m on my own , that maybe i ’m scared of intimacy			0
but it could n’t be further from the truth			0
' i can live without my breast			1
it has n’t changed my character or affected my body image			0
i still wear low - cut tops and swimming costumes - i use prosthetics			2
if i ’m not bothered about what my chest looks like , why should a man ? if someone comes along who ’s right for me , he wo n’t care			0
’ @entity8 is not alone in deciding against reconstructive surgery after mastectomy			1
around 17,000 women a year have a mastectomy , but only a quarter have reconstructive surgery , according to the @entity72 and @entity73 of @entity74 and @entity75 published last year			2
the majority of reconstructions are performed at the same time as surgery to remove the cancer			1
women who wait often want time to accept their diagnosis and its impact on their self - image			2
mother - daughter duo ( pictured in 1992 ) : ' you do n't argue with @entity25 , ' laughs @entity8 about her daughter 's insistence she be seen by a specialist in the @entity89 but most breast cancer patients never have a reconstruction			1
' in specialist centres that offer reconstruction routinely and have access to highly trained surgeons , only about 40 to 50 per cent of women have one , ’ says @entity97 , consultant breast surgeon at the @entity98 , @entity99			1
ms @entity97 says that women often find their daughters are the ones encouraging them to have reconstructions			0
' the daughters are usually transferring feelings about their own self - image - they ’re sure they would choose one so think it must be right for their mother , ’ says ms @entity97			2
' women have different relationships with their breasts throughout their lives			0
a lot of older women , particularly mothers , see their breasts as functional and now they ’ve served their purpose are less affected by their loss , while younger women are more likely to have reconstructions			0
’ a reconstruction is major surgery and can take three months to recover from , which also puts women off , she adds			1
' their breasts are never going to look , feel or have the same sensation as before treatment			0
some patients take pride in their scars and see them as a sign of winning a battle			2
’ others may see their breasts as a threat that could potentially kill them , so are not concerned about losing them			0
' if i ’m not bothered about what my chest looks like , why should a man ? if someone comes along who ’s right for me , he wo n’t care			0
’ ' as long as they ’re fully informed about options , women tend to make the best decisions for themselves , ’ adds ms @entity97			0
therein lies a problem , as many women are not fully informed about their options , says @entity150 , plastic surgeon and @entity153 member , who co-authored the audit			0
lack of awareness of the options and access to specialist plastic surgeons play a significant role in the low rates of reconstructions			0
the audit found more than a third of women surveyed said the risks and benefits of reconstruction were never discussed			2
options include an implant - based reconstruction , or a tissue reconstruction that involves skin , fat and muscle grafting			1
reconstructive surgery is not risk - free - 35 five per cent of women who have implant reconstructions undergo a ' revision ’ operation within five years due to problems , including capsular contracture ( when tissue forms around the implant , causing hardness and pain ) - or asymmetry			1
' the surviving breast will naturally age , while the implant has n’t , ’ explains mr @entity150			2
this problem is avoided with a tissue reconstruction as the breast ages the same way as the other breast and changes size , but the surgery is longer , more complex , and leaves scars			1
@entity8 had an advanced invasive ductal carcinoma - cancer affecting the cells lining the milk ducts			1
she had felt a lump while bathing and was soon referred to the @entity204 in @entity205 , @entity14			0
she was given a biopsy and then the shocking news that she had cancer , and it had spread to her lymph nodes			2
like daughter , like mother : @entity8 , pictured on the catwalk , joins many other women in refusing reconstructive surgery ' my younger sister , @entity215 , who came with me to get the diagnosis , was bawling her eyes out , but it felt like the doctor was talking to someone else			1
all i heard was “ cancer ” and “ advanced ”			0
’ delivering the news to her children @entity227 , then 21 and training to be an actor in @entity229 , and @entity25 , then 35 , who was working in @entity230 , was emotional			0
' everyone cried but me - i was shell - shocked			0
’ but @entity8 remained positive			1
' i said to @entity25 : “ wherever this has come from , it ’s going right back , ” and she said she knew i ’d be fine			0
’ @entity25 insisted @entity8 got a second opinion from a specialist in the @entity89 ' you do n’t argue with @entity25 , ’ @entity8 laughs			1
@entity8 , who by now had been referred to the @entity98 , immediately started chemotherapy to shrink the tumour , before doctors decided that @entity8 should have a mastectomy			1
@entity8 was also seeing specialists at the @entity242 in the @entity89 and she opted to have the surgery - removing her breast and affected lymph nodes - there			1
' @entity25 arranged an apartment for me near the @entity242 while i recuperated			0
’ @entity8 stayed there for three months while undergoing radiotherapy			1
back in the @entity250 , @entity8 started hormone therapy with the drug anastrozole , which stops the production of oestrogen and cuts the risk of breast cancer recurring			1
@entity8 took anastrozole for seven years , but stopped because of the side - effects			1
' it made me so puffy i could n’t see my cheekbones , i was bloated , tired , moody , had pins and needles - you name it			0
’ her regular check - ups ended after five years , and she now has the three - yearly mammograms that are offered by the @entity268			0
' i ’ve been free of cancer so long i do n’t think about it any more			2
now i see and appreciate the detail in life , as if someone ’s turned up the colour			0
i ’ve found myself again and i want other women going through it to know that ’s possible - with or without your breasts			0
’ @entity3 is working on a natural skincare line with @entity282 products , which will donate 20 per cent of profits from sales of products during october to breast cancer research : @entity286			1

' i can live without my breast , ' says @entity8 - and so can many others
most breast cancer patients never have a reconstruction
this may be because it is major surgery , often taking 3 months to recover
and it 's not risk - free : over a third who have it undergo ' revision ' surgery
