by @entity0 published : 18:47 est , 20 january 2013 updated : 06:38 est , 21 january 2013 the @entity1 has said that the lithium battery which caught fire in a @entity5 @entity4 was not overcharged and experts have said the cause could be because of a ' chain of events ' on - board the troubled passenger airliner			1
an examination of the flight data recorder indicated that the battery which caught fire mid flight and forced the @entity4 aircraft to make an emergency landing did n't exceed its designed voltage of 32 volts			1
@entity1 investigators are continuing to look at the battery system and plan to meet on tuesday with officials from @entity24 , the manufacturer of the charger for the 787s lithium ion batteries , at the company 's headquarters in @entity19 , @entity20 , said @entity27 , a spokeswoman for the board			1
culprit : the @entity4 's lithium battery can self heat as a result of temperature and pressure changes , which may have caused this battery fire on a @entity4 at @entity36 , @entity37 on january 7 ' potentially there could be some other charging issue , ' @entity27 said			1
' we 're not prepared to say there was no charging issue			0
' even though it appears the voltage limit was n't exceeded in the case of the @entity5 787 battery that caught fire on january 7th in @entity37 , it 's possible that the battery failures in that plane and in an @entity52 plane that made an emergency landing in @entity54 last week may be due to a charging problem , according to @entity56 , a former @entity1 board member and aviation safety expert			1
too much current flowing too fast into a battery can overwhelm the battery , causing it to short - circuit and overheat even if the battery 's voltage remains within its design limit , he said			1
' the battery is like a big sponge , ' @entity56 said			2
' you can feed it with an eye dropper or you can feed it with a garden hose			0
if allowed , it will soak up everything it can from the garden hose until it destroys itself			0
' the plane made the landing in @entity79 after a burning smell was also detected in the cockpit			0
both all @entity82 and @entity5 have grounded their entire fleets of the problematic aircraft both @entity54 and the @entity85 have opened investigations into the plane after a series of incidents have raised safety concerns there are so many redundancies and safeguards in aviation that when an accident or mishap occurs , it almost always is the result of a chain of events rather than a single failure , he said			1
the @entity5 plane caught fire jan. 7 while it was sitting on the tarmac at @entity37 's @entity36			1
in a separate incident on jan. 16 , an ana flight made an emergency landing in western @entity54 after a cockpit message warned of battery problems and a burning smell was detected in the cockpit and cabin			2
an investigator in @entity54 said friday that the burned insides of the plane 's lithium ion battery show the battery received voltage in excess of its design limits			1
since then , all 50 787s that @entity4 has delivered to airlines ' fleets have been grounded , and the manufacturer has halted deliveries of new planes until it can address the electrical problems			1
the batteries in two incidents ' had a thermal overrun because they short - circuited , ' @entity56 said			0
' the question is whether it was a manufacturing flaw in the battery or whether it was induced by battery charging			2
' this preliminary finding , goes contrary to a @entity54 investigation on friday which found that the @entity135 operated their lithium batteries at a voltage above its design limit			1
following the report @entity85 officials joined @entity54 's probe into the jets after all 50 of the 787s in use around the world have been stopped from flying			1
the new generation of light lithium batteries was going to deliver equal power at half the weight , but it appears that the chemistry inside the ‘ thermal runway ’ can self - heat if external temperature and pressure change , something which frequently occurs in aviation			0
members of the press are shown the @entity4 's innovative led lighting system , which was designed to reduce jet lag during a tour of the aircraft in february 2012 concerns over the battery , prompted by an emergency landing of an @entity52 plane on wednesday , has seen the plane grounded across the globe			1
the @entity85 investigators - one each from the @entity170 and the @entity1 and two from @entity172 - today inspected the @entity52 jet on the tarmac at @entity175 in western @entity54			0
an initial inspection by @entity54 officials of the 787 found that a flammable battery fluid known as electrolyte had leaked from the plane 's main lithium - ion battery beneath the cockpit			1
it also found burn marks around the battery			2
eight airlines fly the ‘ plastic plane ’ , so - called because its fuselage is ‘ spun ’ from super-strong but lightweight carbon fibre , which cuts weight and fuel consumption , rather than constructed from aluminium			0
@entity193 has ordered 24 and holiday firm @entity194 has ordered 8 of the planes – with their deliveries starting from next month – but say they are standing by the stricken airliner			0
@entity194 is scheduled to be the first @entity199 flyer of @entity135 in may			1
complex : parts for the flagship craft are constructed by firms around the world @entity205 , the maker of the lithium - ion batteries used in the 787s , said thursday it was helping with the investigation but that the cause of the problem was unclear			2
it said the problem could be the battery , the power source or the electronics system			2
@entity215 air safety bosses acted just hours after @entity85 ’s @entity170 ( @entity170 ) issued an ‘ @entity216 ’ to halt flights of the planes - the first time a fleet of aircraft has been grounded across the world in 34 years			2
the @entity170 ’s emergency directive said the action was ‘ prompted by recent incidents involving lithium ion battery failures that resulted in the release of flammable electrolytes , heat damage and smoke ’ on two aircraft			0
’ it said : ’ the cause of these failures is currently under investigation ’ but warned more ominously : ’ these conditions , if not corrected , could result in damage to critical systems and structures , and the potential for fire in the electrical compartment			2
’ the decision to ground the 50 planes currently in service is a humiliating blow to the world ’s biggest aircraft maker , which has seen its shares plummet since the emergency ana jet emergency landing on wednesday			2
grounded : passengers are forced to evacuate a @entity54 @entity4 using the plane 's escape slides following an emergency landing at @entity175 on january 7th @entity54 's two largest air carriers all @entity82 and @entity5 voluntarily grounded their 787s following the emergency landing at @entity79 airport out of service : one of @entity259 six 787s sits on the tarmac at @entity261 in @entity262 some 137 passengers and crew members on an @entity266 flight were evacuated down escape chutes when smoke was detected on board			1
the @entity4 is the first airliner to make extensive use of lithium - ion batteries			2
they charge faster and can be better molded to space - saving shapes compared with other aeroplane batteries			0
but the electrolyte fluid also conducts electricity , so as it spreads it can cause short - circuits and ignite fires			0
its corrosiveness also raised concern about whether a leak might weaken a key support structure of the plane			0
@entity284 , professor emeritus of aeronautical engineering at @entity286 said : ‘ unfortunately , what @entity4 did to save weight is use the same batteries that are in the electric cars , and they are running into the same problems with the 787 as the problems that have shown up in electric cars			2
’ the battery fire is just one of a series of problems - including two fuel leaks , a wiring problem , brake computer glitch and cracked cockpit window – to afflict the 787 which got off to a bad start when launched three years late			1
touchdown : a @entity305 is seen coming in to land at the @entity306 in july last year			0
the aircraft has been plagued with safety issues since entering commercial service in 2011 among the 50 planes grounded are the six @entity135 owned by @entity259 , the only @entity85 airline to operate the plane			1
the @entity313 government also ordered @entity314 to ground its fleet of six 787s			0
the two @entity135 owned by @entity318 ’s @entity317 were also grounded alongside the 24 in @entity54			1
on wednesday a @entity320 airlines 787 flight from @entity324 ’s @entity323 airport was also cancelled ahead of the global grounding			0
all will be subject to strict safety tests before being allowed to take off again			0
@entity327 , @entity4 's chairman , president and ceo , said the company is working with the @entity170 to resolve the situation as quickly as possible			1
' we are confident the 787 is safe and we stand behind its overall integrity , ' he said in a statement			0
' we will be taking every necessary step in the coming days to assure our customers and the traveling public of the 787 's safety and to return the airplanes to service			0
' @entity342 , chief engineer on the 787 , said last week that the plane 's batteries have operated through a combined 1.3 million hours and never had an internal fault			0
he said they were built with multiple protections to ensure that failures ' do n't put the airplane at risk ' .			0

the battery that caught fire in a @entity5 @entity4 in @entity37 earlier this month was not overcharged
experts have said the problem ' always is the result of a chain of events rather than a single failure '
all 50 of the world 's @entity135 owned by eight airlines now grounded
