the campaign is intended to break the stigma around these issues			1
according to previous reports , soldiers have suffered ridicule and contempt from their colleagues for admitting they are struggling to cope			2
the findings by @entity54 , a research arm of the @entity10 , found that soldiers serving two or more tours of duty are six times more likely to suffer than those on one tour			1
concern for the veterans of these long campaigns is underlined by the fact that more former servicemen have committed suicide since the 1982 @entity68 than died in battle , when 255 were killed			2
earlier this year , @entity71 @entity70 , 29 , committed suicide			2
in a note he described the guilt of surviving an incident in @entity3 that killed two comrades			2
@entity70 was found hanged in a quarry near his home in @entity79 , @entity80			2
taking its toll : earlier this year , @entity71 @entity70 ( right ) committed suicide over the guilt of surviving an incident in @entity3 that killed two comrades , including lance corporal @entity86 ( left ) the @entity10 found that across the @entity91 , @entity88 , the @entity89 and the @entity90 , reservists show higher rates of mental problems than regular personnel			1

he admitted : ‘ in @entity4 , i shoved my pistol into my throat			2
i wanted to “ check out ”			0
only my fears for my family stopped me			0
on the same tour , in 2004 , a local kid pointed a weapon at me and i was so depressed i actually wanted him to shoot me			0
warning : former army colonel @entity113 , mp for @entity114 , @entity115 , said manpower cuts could trigger more cases of mental ill - health ‘ i went to @entity3 in 2009 and my mental and emotional health got worse			1
i saw my mates die and we were outnumbered by the @entity122 every day			0
‘ it was n’t until december 2010 that i got the package of treatment and compensation i need			1
getting help and support can be very difficult			0
i needed really good doctors and lawyers			0
the @entity10 fought the case			1
’ @entity132 now receives 75 per cent of his salary at the time of his mobilisation			0
the @entity89 is committed to cutting 20,000 soldiers before 2018			0
many of those made redundant will be veterans of @entity3 and @entity4 and their places on the frontline are expected to be filled by reservists such as @entity132			0
military charity @entity142 warned that more must be done to support reservists ’ mental health			1
@entity145 , the chief executive of @entity142 , said : ‘ reservists are more likely to suffer post-traumatic stress than regular counterparts because they spent less time among their peers and must switch between the military and civilian communities quickly and regularly			1
‘ it is very important as we increase our reliance on reservists that these men and women are properly prepared and supported			0
this means before , during and after their deployments			0
combat stress has created two liaison officers to work specifically with reservists to ensure they receive the support they require			0
’ the manpower cuts could trigger more cases of mental ill - health , according to former army colonel @entity113 , mp for @entity114 , @entity115			1
he said last night : ‘ soldiers want to be treated among their own			0
they always have done and they always will			0
today ’s problems seem to be obvious and as more soldiers leave the regimental system and find themselves in civilian life they will not have their friends close at hand			0
‘ only they really appreciate the difficulties of spending so long on the frontline			0
’ the @entity10 said : ‘ the mental health of service personnel is a top priority and we have robust systems in place to identify and treat those with mental health issues			1
' we are also committed to reducing the stigma associated with mental illness such as through briefing service personnel , their families and the chain of command			1
