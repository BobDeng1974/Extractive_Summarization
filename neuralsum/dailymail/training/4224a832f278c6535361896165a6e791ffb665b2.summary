a band of wild chimpanzees have been caught on camera slipping into fields under the cover of darkness to steal ears of maize			1
the apes , which included females and infants , were then seen escaping back into the @entity12 forest clutching armfuls of the crop			1
over a 20 - day period the primates were filmed raiding the nearby maize fields a total of 14 times			1
the group carried out this act a total of 14 times primatologists believe the behaviour is an adaptation the chimpanzees have learnt as their normal habitat in @entity25 , is being destroyed by commercial logging			1
the animals predominantly performed the raids on moonless nights because they were less likely to be spotted by the local farmers who guard their crops as they reach maturity , said the researchers			1
experts have found that @entity45 chimps in @entity46 have a favourite tool set for catching their staple food of ants			0
they search far and wide to find a spindly shrub with straight shoots , called @entity53 , which makes the ideal tool to hunt aggressive army ants , new research reveals			0
the plant provides the animals with two different types of tool - a thicker shoot for ‘ digging ’ and a more slender tool for ' dipping '			0
when they have found an army ant colony , chimpanzees will dig into the nest with the first tool to aggravate the insects			0
they then dip the second tool into the nest , causing the angry ants to swarm up it			0
dr @entity72 , from the @entity73 in @entity74 , explained : ' to our knowledge , this is the first report of long , repeated and group night activities by a great ape species outside of moonlit nights			2
' the nightlife of chimpanzees has been neglected and we have probably missed some interesting activities as night - time lasts around half of each 24 hours in the equatorial regions			2
' the researchers , whose findings are published in the journal @entity90 , set up cameras on the edge of an area of forest where it bordered a maize field			2
over 20 days , the research team observed parties of around eight chimpanzees climbing across a branch and lowering themselves into the maize field where they would spend up to two hours foraging			1
footage then shows them stealthily creeping out of the fields and back into the direction of the national park			0
the chimps also carried out their raids throughout the day , but the researchers spotted the animals were noticeably more anxious during these light hours			2
although the raids occurred at different times over the 20 - day period , the chimpanzees predominantly carried out the robberies on moonless nights ( pictured ) because they were less likely to be spotted by the local farmers who guard their crops as they reach maturity in a number of the recordings , the animals were seen scanning the distance , scratching themselves and regularly defecating , often diarrhoea , which the study claimed is a common sign of nervousness			1
a number of the animals also appeared to be standing guard during the recordings , too , in which they assumed a quadrupedal posture for more than five seconds without moving			0
dr @entity72 added : even though the chimpanzees ' home range has been seriously damaged and disturbed by both logging activities and significant human demographic pressure , chimpanzees have shown great behavioural flexibility including unexpected nocturnal behaviour , in order to take advantage of the proximity of domestic nutritive food			0
' experts believe the behaviour is an adaptation the chimpanzees have learnt as their habitat in the @entity25 ( pictured ) is being destroyed as a result of commercial logging and degraded agricultural lands			1

apes in @entity12 were caught on camera stealing maize from a nearby field
over a 20 - day period , the primates raided the crop fields 14 times
primatologists believe the behaviour is an adaptation the chimpanzees have learned as their normal habitat in @entity25 is destroyed
they were caught raiding the fields at different times of day
but , the group predominantly worked on moonless nights to avoid detection
during daylight hours , the apes showed signs of anxiety and nervousness
