bloatware can also refer to extras that come with wanted software including browser toolbars , desktop widgets or other unwanted additions			0
' software has always been the achilles heel for @entity1 , ' said @entity44 , which made the claim			1
' there are some really interesting things @entity1 is doing if our info is correct , and perhaps the biggest change the @entity4 will bring is the removal of all pre-installed @entity1 apps , or at least that ’s how our insider put it			1
' the @entity58 firm has been heavily criticised in the past for only offering half the storage its customers pay for and although this has been improved with the @entity62 , it is still a problem			1
@entity64 revealed that on a @entity66 @entity62 , users get approximately @entity67 of space for their own personal files , photos and apps			1
however , the @entity4 will come with apps like @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 ( with a free office 365 subscription ) , and @entity77 , according to @entity44			1
both new @entity4 phones will have all - metal bodies and 5.1inch screens , it has been claimed			1
' @entity1 plans to release two new versions of its top - tier @entity9 smartphone next month , including a model with a display covering three sides , according to people with direct knowledge of the matter , ' @entity81 said			1
the ' special edition ' version will have the curved technology , according to @entity44			0
the @entity58 giant believes its curved technology could give it an edge over arch rival @entity96			0
the handset is expected to be unveiled at @entity98 , a trade show in @entity100 , which takes place from 2 - 5 march			0
' today , we can confirm that @entity1 is indeed developing a @entity4 with two - edge displays , one on each side , reports our source , ' said the @entity108 site			1

in january , which ? magazine tested the eight most popular @entity66 handsets from @entity1 , @entity96 , @entity113 , @entity114 , @entity115 and @entity116 , pictured			1
@entity1 's @entity117 was the worst performing handset , with only 54 % ( @entity118 ) of available storage , while @entity96 's @entity120 was the best , with 79 % ( @entity121 ) previous leaks from @entity123 say the @entity124 , the codename believed to be assigned to the @entity4 , will feature a @entity126 ( 2560 x 1440 resolution ) 5.5inch display			1
it will also have an octa - core processor , @entity133 - @entity132 graphics processing unit , and a 16 - megapixel rear - facing camera			0
the handset is expected to be unveiled at @entity98 , a trade show in @entity100 , which takes place from 2 - 5 march			0
however , @entity139 will have the ability to work in a left or right handed mode ' you will have an option to choose favourite contacts and an ability to assign specific colours to them , ' explained @entity44			0
' so , calls and notifications from important people will show the designated color lighting on the edge area			0
' @entity1 surprised audiences at the @entity156 - based trade show @entity154 in september when it unveiled its curved device			1
the screen was described by @entity1 's @entity159 at the event as working like a ' ticker ' , with notifications and news scrolling along it			1
the @entity166 's unique curved touchscreen provides quick access to frequently used apps and alerts			0
the curved screen displays notifications at the top and bottom , while viewing a video without disruption , for example			0
these images , which appear to have been taken in a toilet , show a rounded edge and antenna bars almost identical to @entity96 's @entity180 in the ' standard ' version of the handset because the curved edge remains visible even if a flip - book style protective cover is used , it is easier to keep up - to - date with incoming calls and messages			0
previous leaks from @entity123 say the @entity124 — the codename believed to be assigned to the @entity4 — will feature a @entity126 ( 2560 x 1440 resolution ) display , octa - core processor , @entity133 - @entity132 graphics processing unit , and a 16 - megapixel rear - facing camera			1
earlier this month , in the face of stiff competition , and following a consecutive drop in profits , @entity1 announced plans to curb the number of phones it makes each year			1
instead of releasing handset after handset and saturating the market with @entity1 devices , the firm has decided it needs to concentrate on making fewer handsets , better			1
the @entity58 manufacturer is also expected to ramp up production of its remaining models so they can be sold more cheaply			0
@entity96 's on 1 march , @entity1 and @entity115 are separately hosting events in @entity100 , to kick off this year 's @entity98 ( @entity98 )			1

@entity1 's invite hints at a curved device ( pictured ) despite a drop in profits , @entity1 has retained its leading position in the global smartphone market during the last quarter			1
but , it was the only top five manufacturer to record a sales decline			0

@entity1 's shipments fell 8 per cent to 78.1 million smartphones in the third quarter , and its market share eroded to 24 per cent from 33 per cent this time last year			1
@entity1 's rise to the world 's top smartphone maker was helped by its partnership with @entity116 's @entity239 operating system			1
but other @entity239 handset makers are matching @entity1 in terms of performance , features and design			1
shares of @entity1 did rise 4 per cent , however , in @entity246			2
although the earnings were weak , they were better than some forecasts			0
plus @entity1 said it is expecting a strong fourth quarter in the run up to @entity252			2
the strategy was unveiled during a presentation in @entity255 by @entity1 's head of investor relations , @entity256			2

last month , for the third consecutive quarter , @entity1 's profits took a hit			2
the smartphone maker reported its lowest quarterly earnings in three years , after profits plummeted by 60 per cent compared to the same time last year			0
compared to a record - high of £ 6 billion ( $ 9.5 billion ) in 2013 , the company achieved £ 2.5 billion ( $ 3.8 billion ) profits for july to september			0
these figures were in line with what @entity1 predicted earlier in october , and the firm blamed the drop on weak sales of its new @entity9 model			2
the @entity58 electronics giant became the biggest smartphone brand thanks to the popularity of earlier @entity9 models			0
but the larger screen on @entity96 's new @entity283 has been linked with luring customers away from the larger @entity9 range			0
while in @entity287 , local brands are making inroads into @entity1 's business			2
in response to the dramatic drop , @entity1 also vowed to revamp its smartphone range to win back customers			2

in emerging markets , such as @entity314 and @entity287 , @entity1 's smartphone sales have been overtaken by local rivals the company 's response ' was not quick enough , ' said mr @entity256			2
the earnings were below the median of analysts ' expectations of £ 3 billion ( $ 4.9 billion ) , according to @entity322 , a financial data provider			0

the company said it ' cautiously expects increased shipments of new smartphones and strong seasonal demand for tv products '			0
the latest profit drop comes despite the launch of the @entity340 ( pictured ) earlier this year , which was received by mostly rave reviews			0
the @entity340 handpicked features from its competitors and put them all into a single handset , with some calling it a ' superphone ' in emerging markets , such as @entity314 and @entity287 , @entity1 's smartphone sales were overtaken by local rivals			2
' rather than seeking stability , @entity1 should seek to distinguish [ its phones ] with @entity9 's design policies , ' @entity348 , an analyst at @entity349 said			2
the company moved the launch of the @entity355 , a large smartphone with a stylus , to late september from october after @entity96 unveiled the @entity357			0
it also began sales of the @entity355 4 in @entity287 last month , getting an early start in the world 's most populous country before @entity96 .			0
