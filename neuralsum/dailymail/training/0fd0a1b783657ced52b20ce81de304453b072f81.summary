@entity0 may already be in the midst of one of its worst droughts in decades , but now scientists have warned that the southwest is at risk of water shortages which could last up to 30 years			0
climate scientists have claimed that the chances of experiencing a decade - long drought in the region have now reached 50 per cent , while the chances of a ' megadrought ' lasting more than 30 years is now between 20 and 50 per cent			1
researchers from @entity15 , the @entity16 and @entity17 say their predictions should be viewed as ' conservative ' as not enough is being done to curb emissions that lead to climate change			0
@entity21 , a professor at @entity15 , said any of these long droughts would ' be worse than anything seen during the last 2,000 years and would pose unprecedented challenges to water resources in the region '			0
roughly 58 per cent of @entity0 is now facing ' exceptional ' drought conditions , the most severe category of drought , as rivers dry up and farmers warn of crop failures across the state			2
@entity0 is currently in the grips of one of the most severe droughts in the last decade as climate scientists warn the problem could get even worse climate experts have warned that the chances of a drought lasting longer than a decade affecting the area are now around 50 per cent more worryingly the chances of a ' megadrought ' , lasting more than 30 years , in the southwest are now between 20 and 50 per cent researchers claim their estimates should be viewed as ' conservative ' as temperatures are still rising due to man - made climate change the professor who lead the study says a decade - long drought in @entity0 would ' be worse than anything seen during the last 2,000 years ' around 60 per cent of @entity0 is now facing ' exceptional ' drought conditions , the worst possible rating on a scale of five a buoy sits on cracked earth at the bottom of a dry inlet of @entity60 on august 30 , 2014 in @entity61 , @entity0 authors of the study say because not enough is being done to combat climate change emissions the chances of a ' megadrought ' are becoming increasingly likely animal prints are visible in dry cracked earth on the banks of @entity60 in @entity61 , @entity0 , as the state experiences one of the worst droughts in a decade a paddleboarder floats on the waters of @entity60 at @entity74 in @entity0 which is filled with houseboats the @entity77 marina sits in the low waters of @entity60 , which is now several hundred metres from the concrete boat ramp ( pictured in the foreground ) slopes of dry cracked earth show where the waters of @entity60 used to reach before it began drying out during @entity0 's drought lines running along the slopes of earth show how the surface of @entity60 in @entity0 has slowly dropped during the drought a boat cruises along the remaining water at the bottom of @entity60 , but is dwarfed by the former banks of the lake rising up in the background dust bowl : deer walk along the dusty , stony shores that used to be covered by water from @entity60 uncovered : an old bridge , which used to be hidden underneath the water , has been uncovered and is now visible near taller , more modern constructions experts have said that they can not say when the @entity0 drought will end , but predicted that the conditions offer ' a glimpse of the future ' a bridge support near the @entity110 in @entity0 displays a 5mph for boats that used to travel down the river before it dried up as the drought in @entity0 continues for a third year , the water level in @entity60 is now at its lowest level since 1977 there is now less than 30 per cent of the water left in @entity60 , @entity0 ( pictured ) as the drought there enters its third year experts are warning that current conditions in @entity0 could provide a glimpse into the future of the southwest thanks to climate change			1

scientists warn possibility of ' megadrought ' in southwest @entity133 is between 20 and 50 per cent due to climate change
they say decade - long drought would be worse than any in the last 2,000 years and ask authorities to start *planning*
almost 60 per cent of @entity0 is now facing ' exceptional ' drought conditions as dry weather continues for third year
