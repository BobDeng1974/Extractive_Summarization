a @entity1 couple discovered their 12 - year - old adopted son was molesting their other children and are now suing the @entity5 , who they say failed to reveal to them the boy 's startling past			1
@entity9 and @entity10 , who 've withheld their last names from reporters , say their social worker and the state neglected to tell them that at his previous home the boy was n't even allowed to be in the same room as younger children			1
when they learned was he was capable of , it was too late			0
they say he 's now been convicted of child molestation			0
nowhere to turn : @entity9 and @entity10 are suing the state of @entity29 after learning the 12 - year - old boy they adopted in 2013 molested their six other children soon after had no idea : the couple 's son , the eldest of their family seen here , was barred from even being in the same room as other children in a previous home , which @entity9 and @entity43 were n't told now there 's no where for the boy to go and , since he 's not allowed to stay with their other children , @entity9 and @entity10 must pay for him to live in a separate home from the one where they 're raising their six other kids			1
the nightmare began shortly after they adopted the boy			2
@entity9 told state officials : ' we can handle his behaviors as long as he 's not a danger to my children			1
' the boy was placed in the couple 's home along with two other foster children and the couple 's four biological children			2
two months after his march 2013 adoption , @entity9 and @entity10 's 8 - year - old adopted son began made ' sexual gestures , ' @entity67 reports			1
the 8 - year - old soon admitted to his parents what his adopted older brother had done			2
' i was getting scared , ' @entity9 said			2
' then he said , he does this to our other one too			0
' but the situation only worsened thereafter			0
@entity9 and @entity10 spoke to their other children and all six had been fondled or otherwise molested by the eldest adopted son			1
after some digging , @entity9 ' found there was a safety plan put in place for him in another home , where he was n't even supposed to be in the same room as younger children			1
' since the couple have adopted the boy and are no longer simply fostering him , he ca n't simply be taken back by the state			2
' they lied to us , put our children in danger , and then told us we had to live with it , ' @entity9 said			1
' throwing him away is not an option ' : the couple are admirably still supporting the boy , who must now live in a separate home from them and their other children , which they must pay for not that either deeply devoted parent would allow the state to have him			0
they say they intend to continue doing everything they can to help him			0
' throwing him away his not an option			0
we 're still trying to do everything we can , ' @entity10 said			0
the couple are now suing the @entity5			1
' not only did the state fail us , they failed him , ' @entity9 said			1
the state agency is not commenting on the matter			0
they told kiro only : ' we are working with our partners in the office of attorney general to review this lawsuit filing			0
at this point , it contains allegations that will be proven or disproven in court , and we do not intend to try the case in the media			0

@entity1 parents @entity9 and @entity10 , who are *withholding* their last name , were *horrified* to learn a boy they *'d* adopted was fondling all their children
the parents took him in on the *condition* that he was not a danger to their other children
@entity9 and @entity10 say officials failed to reveal previous troubles and are suing the @entity5 .
