by @entity0 published : 20:20 est , 27 october 2013 updated : 07:00 est , 28 october 2013 snatched : two of the @entity3 's famous ravens have been killed by a fox			1
legend has it that six ravens must guard the @entity3 at all times or the monarchy will fall			1
so security has been beefed up at the @entity11 after a fox killed two of the treasured birds , leaving the minimum number required to save the @entity16			1
the ravens , named @entity18 , were snatched just before they were due to be locked up in their cages overnight			1
fortunately there were two spare birds at the @entity3 to keep the numbers up			1
a spokesman for @entity25 , the charity that cares for the birds , said it had been a ‘ lucky escape ’ because the hungry fox had almost taken the number of ravens below six			1
the dead birds were found by keepers at dusk and tests showed they were killed by a fox			2
grip was named after the raven in @entity40 ’s @entity39 that inspired a poem by @entity42 , while @entity43 was chosen to honour the @entity44			2
the two new birds brought in as replacements have been given the same names			0
@entity48 , of @entity25 , said : ‘ the ravens are put to bed each evening in secure enclosures to minimise these risks , however sadly a fox captured two of the ravens before they were put to bed			2
' at dusk we could n’t find them			0
eventually , they were found within the inner walls … currently we have eight ravens at the @entity3			1
the legend mentions six ravens and we like to have two extra			0
’ in light of the attacks , @entity25 has increased security and reviewed pest control measures			0
the legend of the ravens of the @entity3 is said to have begun under the reign of @entity70 , who insisted that they should be protected			1
guardians : the tower 's ravens are cared for by the @entity74 historic : the ravens are rumoured to have first been protected on order of @entity70 watchers : a raven can be seen looking over @entity74 at the @entity3 in 1996 the birds , known as ‘ guardians of @entity3 ’ , are very well looked after , eating a diet of meat from @entity85 market , biscuits soaked in blood , and salt and vinegar crisps as a treat			1
an annual budget of £ 4,000 is set aside for their care			0
most ravens in the wild have a life expectancy of 12 years but those in the @entity3 – who have their wings clipped to stop them flying away – usually live past their 25th birthday , with some reaching 40			1
current residents @entity101 , @entity103 , @entity104 , @entity105 , @entity106 will this winter see their home refurbished for the first time in 20 years			0
taken : the ravens , named @entity18 , were snatched just before they were due to be locked up in their cages at the @entity3 overnight they are allowed to roam on the south lawn and @entity114 during the day but are locked up at night			1
from next year , they will have modern cages with a secure area			0
the fox attack occurred in may and only came to light after a freedom of information request			0
fortunately , no other ravens have been killed since but two died naturally and a third bird was dismissed for eating tv aerials			0
they have all been replaced			0
legend has it that wild ravens have lived in the @entity3 for more than five hundred years			1
the birds are notorious scavengers and could have been attracted to the fortress by the smell given off by the corpses of those who had been executed			0
there are accounts of the carnivorous animals looking grimly on at the executions of @entity138 and @entity139 - both wives of @entity142 king @entity141 superstitions that the ravens staying at the tower is the key to the nation 's survival are thought to have originated around the 17th century , when reigning monarch @entity70 took the legend seriously enough to have the birds protected			1
tradition : two ravens pictured in the @entity3 in the 1960s one story tells that the king complained to his @entity156 , @entity157 , that the birds were leaving unsightly droppings on his telescope , and that he wanted them removed			1
but when he was told of the legend that the ravens were linked to the survival of the monarchy - which had only just been restored after the death of @entity167 - he declared that the ravens should have their wings clipped and be kept in the @entity3 to ensure their survival			1
as a compromise , he also decided to move the @entity172 to @entity173			0
another account say that @entity70 first protected the ravens after the people of the capital began attacking them for scavenging in the destruction left by the @entity180 in 1666			0
in modern times , the ravens have one of their wings clipped , which means they can fly for short distances but can not escape the fortress			0
the birds are officially enlisted as soldiers in the @entity189 , and there are records of individuals being dismissed from their ' duties ' at the @entity3 for unsatisfactory conduct			2
close bond : a @entity196 meets a young bird at the @entity3 in the 1980s each raven has a coloured band on its leg to make it easier to identify the birds , which are commonly cited as being the one of the most common reasons for visiting the @entity3 , second only to the @entity205			2
as well as their diet of premium meat , the birds are also feed cheese , boiled eggs , fruit and even vitamin supplements to keep them healthy			0
they are also dutifully protected from the outside world - a report from 2005 showed that crows around the @entity3 were being shot to protect the birds from disease and competition for food - while in the 2006 bird flu scare , they were given a special protective enclosure			2
however , some historians claim that the tradition of keeping ravens in the @entity3 is much less well - established than previously thought			2
in 2004 dr @entity228 , an historian at the @entity3 , searched the record books for the earliest mention of kept ravens , and could find nothing dating from earlier than 1895			2
also in the records that did exist , it was occasionally stated that ' there are none ' of the ravens left - suggesting their fabled link to @entity241 's destiny may not be as strong as first thought .			0
