however the teenager soon became hooked on tanning and has since spent $ 52,505 ( £ 23,000 ) on salon treatments and fake tan products			1
but the blonde , who now lives in @entity30 , refuses to stop using sunbeds and relies on modelling work to fund her addiction			2
she said : ' it 's definitely been worth spending all that money			0

' even when she 's not in the tanning booth , ms @entity2 regularly sunbathes with no skin protection - instead opting for oil to enhance the skin - browning effects of uv rays			1
she added : ' doctors have warned me about skin cancer , but sun - beds give you a base tan so you do n't burn in the sun. i never use sunscreen - only tanning @entity92			1
but i do n't have any moles			0

' time well spent ? @entity2 's love of tanning means she has spent over 66 days of her life on a sun bed withdrawal symptoms witnessed in ' chronically tanned people ' can include depression and anxiety , she reveals.the reason for this , according to @entity126 , a dermatologist in @entity127 , @entity30 , is because tanning can trigger the release of dopamine , a neurotransmitter that can increase a sense of well - being			1

of course , a sunbed habit can have dangerous consequences , even for occasional users ; the increased risk of skin cancer for excessive tanners will come as little surprise to @entity143 the @entity144 says sunbed users are over four times more likely to develop melanoma than those who do n't use them			1
dr @entity126 told @entity111 that this is because tanning beds emit around 12 to 15 times more uv radiation than the sun. ' every time you tan chronically your are increasing your chances of getting skin cancer about 75 percent , ' she said .			1
