@entity1 's ' on - body detection ' users the phone 's accelerometer to know when it 's being moved and will only lock when placed on a flat surface @entity1 has already experimented with unlocking phones using faces , but for some this just is n't immediate enough			1
a number of @entity10 owners have spotted a new feature that keeps the phone constantly unlocked as long as it 's in a person 's hand , resting on their leg or even just sitting in a pocket			1
the ' on - body detection ' feature uses the phone 's built - in accelerometer to know when it 's being handled or moved , and will only lock the screen when placed on a flat surface			1
on - body detection was first spotted by fan site @entity24 in the @entity27 menu of a @entity28 running @entity29			1
but there have since been numerous reports of the phone appearing on other @entity34 devices , and not just @entity1 's own @entity28 range			1
it appears to be linked to the most recent version of @entity38 - a tool used to update @entity1 's built - in apps			1
the on - body detection menu explained : ' the feature uses your device 's accelerometer to detect whether your device is still being carried on the body			1
' if your device detects that it 's no longer being held , your device wo n't stay unlocked			1
' the phone has to be unlocked the first time it is picked up in the morning but once unlocked it will stay open until it is put on a table or similar			1
but as @entity1 added , if the user unlocks their device and hands it to someone else the phone or tablet stays unlocked as long as the other person continues to carry it			1
it is also unclear how active the screen will be in a pocket			2
@entity1 may shut down services but keep the screen unlocked , to avoid opening apps or accidentally calling people , known colloquially as ' butt dialling			1
' @entity1 offers passwords and @entity70 to secure its phone , and more recently added @entity72 ( pictured ) to phones running @entity74 and above			2
it recognises a person ’s face and can establish whether or not the face being shown to the camera is real , or is a photograph these services may then be enabled once the phone detects it is in a person 's hand			2
it is also not clear what impact having the screen constantly unlocked will have on battery life			2
@entity88 has contacted @entity1 for more information			0
a combination of special hardware and software will be used to accurately verify it is you , not a picture of you or someone trying to impersonate you			0
the cameras use infrared technology to identify your face or iris and can recognize you in a variety of lighting conditions			0
these security features are opt - in , meaning that users will be able to still rely on passwords and @entity70 to unlock devices and features if they so desire			0

on - body detection is the latest feature hoping to remove the need to enter security details regularly			0
last week @entity120 said devices running its @entity123 10 software , which launches later this year , can be unlocked by looking at them , or using a fingerprint reader			0
@entity126 made the fingerprint reader , or @entity128 , mainstream on its @entity130 and @entity131 added a reader on its @entity133			0
@entity120 's version is called @entity135 , it will be part of @entity123 10 when it launches later this year			0

last week @entity120 said devices running its @entity123 10 software , which launches later this year , can be unlocked by looking at them ( pictured ) , or using a fingerprint reader called @entity147 , the firm is so confident the system ca n't be fooled and has even tested users holding up pictures of others			2

feature was first spotted by fan site @entity24 on a @entity28
option appeared in the @entity27 security menu on @entity29
once a phone is unlocked , the screen remains ' open ' while it 's being held
it also uses the phone 's accelerometer to remain unlocked even in a pocket
@entity1 has n't *confirmed* feature but it 's been spotted on *multiple* devices
