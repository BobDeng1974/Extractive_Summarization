by @entity0 a @entity2 couple rowed into the record books on friday after becoming the first team to cross the @entity5 from @entity6 to the @entity7 it took @entity9 and his girlfriend @entity10 153 - days to make the journey in their custom - built 23ft row boat			1
the couple celebrated their accomplishment with a kiss as they passed the @entity19 , after enduring a 6,500 - mile journey with no support crew and limited supplies			1
they carried only essentials on board , and kept themselves fed and watered by fishing and using a salt - water convertor			1
a gps system helped them - and their friends and family - keep track of their progress as they crossed the @entity5 , and made their way up from the @entity51 and @entity52 , to @entity28			2
when they reached @entity54 the couple became the first crew to have rowed from mainland @entity6 to the mainland of @entity32			1
' making history in the 21st century ? where do you do that , ' @entity9 said , adding that their crossing was the ' biggest romantic story to be told			1
' ' done ! emotional all round ! ' the couple posted to their @entity66 page friday afternoon , after mooring in @entity54			0
nearly there : the couple make their way towards @entity54 as they complete their 6,500 - mile journey close quarters : the couple made the journey in a 23ft rowboat , and had no back up crew and few amenities adventure : the couple had hoped for calm seas but at times their 23ft boat was faced with challenging conditions @entity9 , 40 , said they had expected the crossing to be smoother , but their boat was tossed about on rough seas and at one point capsized			1
we thought the @entity5 would be this calm little pond that you just row across , ' he told the @entity92			0
' by the fifth day , we were saying to each other , what is going on ? goodness gracious			0
it should be a lot calmer			0
the sea was very , very , very angry			0
' in february a huge swell knocked @entity9 from the boat , the spirit of @entity101 , which capsized with @entity10 still on board			1
fortunately , when it righted itself , she was still in her seat and , although they lost everything on deck , both escaped without injury			0
on another occasion , @entity10 had to rescue her boyfriend of 15 years using their fishing line , after he fell from the boat while trying to take a photo			1
@entity116 - inspiring : @entity9 holds up a flying fish he caught while crossing the @entity5 ready to go : @entity9 used @entity118 to log their journey , which they began on december 30 ' i could n’t turn the boat around and i could n’t stop the boat			1
but what saved him was the fishing line			0
he grabbed onto the fishing line that was behind the boat and i reeled him in , ' she told @entity130			0
the couple also had to flag down a large ship for help when their salt - water convertor broke , leaving them with no fresh water supplies			1
@entity9 documented their journey on @entity118 , opening the account of their adventure on december 30 with the tweet : ' it 's all go for @entity5 rowing monday 9am			2
90 % done.100 % impossible i think			0
i 've never been this prepped in last 12 years of journeys			0
' the couple described their boat capsizing in february as a wake up call , but said despite the danger , the journey was worth it			2
' you get this quiet time , and the sun is setting , and there 's like pink and blue and white fluffy clouds , and it 's just so quiet , ' @entity10 said			2
first leg : @entity10 points to @entity161 as the couple pass the @entity163 in january catch of the day : the couple supplemented their freeze - dried food supplies with freshly caught fish explorers : the couple , who have been together for 15 years , took 153 days to cross the @entity5 @entity168 and adventures are nothing new to the 40 - year - old who in 2006 became the first person to cycle the perimeter of @entity6			1
it took him two years to make his way through 35 countries , and his achievement was acknowledged by @entity101 who described @entity9 as ' a performance that will inspire the youth of the continent '			2
although most of the couple 's latest adventure was spent at sea , they stopped off for a welcome break in the @entity51 in april and arrived in @entity188 just in time to watch a @entity191 game			0
the stops on dry land gave the couple a break from their rigorous eight - hour - a - day rowing schedule , as well as from their limited food supply			2
welcome break : the couple broke up their journey with a stop in the @entity51 achievement : the couple congratulate each other after reaching @entity28 arrivals : @entity9 and @entity10 row past the @entity19 on friday afternoon they had packed freeze dried food , but supplemented that with whatever fish they could catch , meaning that on some days they had the freshest food available , as they feasted on huge sea bass that had been hooked out the @entity5 just moments earlier			1
after reaching their destination yesterday , the couple seemed keen to take a break from the sea , and posted a fun message on @entity118 offering to sell their boat			0
' we have finished rowing our boat from @entity6 to @entity28			2
@ @entity224 keen to buy&use her to get to @entity225 ? ( comes with free advice ) , ' @entity9 tweeted .			0
