but self - confessed train geek @entity6 decided to be a little more ambitious and turned his into an exact replica of a 1980s @entity9 rail carriage			1
it has taken the @entity11 four - and - a - half years , cost around £ 6,300 and at least 2,500 hours of painstaking work to make his childhood dream come true			1
mr @entity6 , who spent several years studying for a phd in @entity37 , recovered many of the original parts from a @entity9 train which was due to be scrapped			1
but he also went to extraordinary lengths to make his train car feel realistic such as installing a photo mural at the end of the carriage so it appears as if it carries on into another car as well as playing a soundtrack of a train clicking along the tracks			1
mr @entity6 has even salvaged a welcome to sign to greet visitors before they enter the train carriage the chairs have all the original features including magazine racks and timetables from the 1980s mr @entity6 says it was his dream to build a replica train in his basement since he was a child mr @entity6 estimates the project cost him around 10,000 canadian dollars - around £ 6,300 - and he had to scrap everything and start again at least three times			1
' i 've always wanted to have a @entity9 train in my basement since i was a kid , ' said mr @entity6 , from @entity66 , @entity67			1
' in fact , when me and my wife were looking to buy a house i would say ' no ' if the basement was n't big enough for me to build it			2
' i still have the letter from when i wrote to @entity9 in 1987 to ask them if they would sell me their seats in 1987			0
they said they could n't			0
but then my friends and i find out about @entity9 train 5647 - it was going to be scrapped			1
' so we got a hold of it before it was gone and took all these original parts			0
' mr @entity6 began building the train in 2008 doing much of the work himself the project took four and a half years and mr @entity6 said he had to start from scratch at least three times the train carriage has provided great entertainment for mr @entity6 's three young children who he says love playing in it the obsession with trains stems from mr @entity6 's childhood and he now runs the largest model train business in @entity11 mr shron ( top centre ) with friends who helped him salvage parts from a @entity9 train that was due to be scrapped mr @entity6 , who runs his own model train company @entity103 for a living , said the construction of the rail carriage has been a struggle , but worth it in the end			1
' the train is where i feel most at home , ' he said			0
' it 's where i feel most at peace			2
especially when it 's hurtling along at 85mph with the snow and rain pelting down outside - it 's the perfect place to be			2
' and my kids love it			0
my five - year old daughter @entity121 will go up and down aisle serving people and my seven - year old son @entity124 likes clipping tickets			0
' i 've also fun on the weekends to hang out there and play cards			0
' watch a video made by @entity129 about the train carriage in his basement			2

father - of - three @entity6 spent around £ 6,300 recreating *cross-country* train
took four and a half years to build the carriage from scratch
' it 's where i *'m* most at peace , ' says self - confessed train geek
