record numbers of patients are being admitted to hospital wards from @entity3 , in further evidence of an overcrowding crisis			1
last week there were 108,301 emergency admissions – mostly elderly – from @entity3			1
this was the most since figures were first collected four years ago			0
@entity10 also showed 6,587 of them had to wait on trolleys for between four and 12 hours – twice as many as in the same week last year			1
yesterday it emerged that hospital managers were planning to take legal action to evict elderly patients who were blocking beds , to free up space on wards			1
overcrowding in some @entity3 departments is now believed to be the worst in living memory @entity22 and @entity23 in @entity24 is giving families seven days to find a place for patients in care homes before they start court proceedings			1
‘ bed - blocking ’ describes when elderly patients remain in hospital despite being fit for discharge because care at home has not been set up for them , or they do not have a place in a nursing home			1
the problem has reached record levels across the @entity39 and is causing @entity3 units to become overcrowded because patients can not be moved up to wards			1
in addition , @entity3 admissions are rising as patients find it increasingly hard to get an appointment with their gps			1
the increase is also being driven by an ageing population			0
furthermore , pressure has intensified over the past few weeks with the onset of winter illnesses , and many casualty departments have urged people to stay away unless severely hurt or ill. figures published yesterday by @entity57 , the body that runs the @entity59 , revealed that @entity3 units were struggling to cope with rising demand			2
a total of 429,200 patients were admitted to emergency departments last week , a rise of more than 5 per cent compared with the same time last year			1
some 30,102 patients waited more than the government ’s four - hour limit to be treated – twice as many as this time last year , and the most in 18 months			2
families are being told they have seven days to find their relative a space in a care home – or risk being taken to court			0
the policy was revealed amid growing concerns over the pressures on hospitals			0
( file image ) but officials failed to publish another key set of statistics showing the number of cancelled operations , @entity3 units closed because they were full , and ambulances diverted to other hospitals			2
these so - called winter - pressure figures are normally released weekly from mid-november , but @entity57 said there would be a ‘ temporary ’ delay while it reviewed ‘ information requirements ’			0
labour health spokesman @entity91 said : ‘ it is clear hospitals in all parts of @entity57 are struggling to cope			0
this @entity96 - led government pushed elderly care services to the brink , leaving people turning to @entity3			2
whole hospitals are being overwhelmed by the pressure			0
they have ignored the problem for far too long and it is threatening to drag down the @entity39 this winter			0
’ over the past fortnight , hospitals in @entity106 in @entity107 , @entity108 in @entity109 , @entity110 in @entity111 , @entity112 in @entity113 and the @entity114 in @entity115 have asked the public to avoid @entity3 except in genuine emergencies			2
last week , a major incident was declared at @entity121 hospital in @entity122 after the @entity39 watchdog found @entity3 staff were struggling to cope with unprecedented demand			1
the pressures are particularly intense in @entity127 , which has a large elderly population			0
its three trusts are on ‘ black alert ’ , meaning they are unwilling to accept patients who are not seriously ill. dr @entity133 , a gp in @entity135 , @entity136 , who also represents the @entity138 , said : ‘ hospitals and patients are caught up in a desperate situation created by cuts			0
hospitals throughout the country are being very tightly squeezed financially , so there is very little slack in the system			0
’ @entity148 , of @entity57 , said : ‘ the @entity39 is pulling out all the stops to meet this rising demand			0
’ last week , a major incident was declared at @entity121 hospital in @entity122 ( pictured ) after the @entity39 watchdog found @entity3 staff were struggling to cope with unprecedented demand			1

last week , there more than *100,000* emergency admissions from @entity3
@entity10 also showed that more than 6,000 of those patients had to wait on trolleys for between four and 12 hours
