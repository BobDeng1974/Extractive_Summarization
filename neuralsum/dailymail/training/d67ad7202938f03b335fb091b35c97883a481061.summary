a rusty old @entity1 convertible which does not run has sold at auction for more than £ 77,000 - nearly five times its estimate - and the new owner will now have to spend another £ 120,000 to get it on the road			1
incredibly , the dilapidated @entity6 sold for £ 77,760 - the same price as a brand new , top - of - the - range @entity10 convertible - its spiritual successor			1
this is because it is one of the extremely rare ' @entity14 ' models , of which there are thought to be just 170 left in existence			1
when it was finally reintroduced to the world at @entity36 ’ @entity35 auction at the weekend , there was no shortage of interest			1
the unnamed buyer was forced to pay way over the £ 15 - 20,000 estimate , but even after he restores it there is a chance he could still make a profit on the car			1
in 2011 , a @entity47 in excellent condition was sold for £ 25,000 less than this one - showing how demand is increasing rapidly			0
slim pickings : there are only around 170 ' @entity14 ' model @entity53 left , which is why they are so expensive wheely good : even after he has paid to renovate it , the buyer could still make a profit on the rare vehicle @entity60 , from @entity1 specialist @entity61 in @entity63 , said : ' the early cars are the collectible ones and prices are still going up			1
' i was not really surprised when it sold for £ 77,000 and , when restored , it will probably be worth in excess of £ 200,000			0
' when it is back on the road , the e-type ’s 3.8 - litre engine will develop around 265 brake horse power			2
this will give the convertible sports car a 0 - 60mph time of seven seconds and a top speed in excess of 150mph			1
restoration : the e-type will hit top speeds of more than 150mph once it has been restored to its former glory glory days : a 1961 @entity1 e-type sits in a driveway back in its heyday last month , the e-type was voted the greatest car of all time , beating @entity91 , @entity92 and the @entity93 to the crown			1
the iconic car , launched in 1961 , was given the award by new @entity97 show @entity98 , picking up 32 per cent of the vote			2
the @entity100 came in second with 20 per cent , just ahead of the @entity101 , with 18 per cent			2
eight @entity103 cars made the top 10 , with @entity105 , the show 's car trading expert , saying : ' this underlines the incredible heritage of @entity103 car manufacturing , where originality , style and performance have been the hallmarks of many of our greatest cars			1
' the @entity21 , also known as the @entity21 , was produced between 1961 and 1975 , and is cherished by @entity118 as one of the greatest , if not the greatest car the country ever made			1
it was designed by @entity123 , a @entity124 man born in 1916 who spent almost 20 years working for @entity1 , and also designed the @entity125 worked at @entity126 during @entity127 , before heading to @entity128 to work at @entity129 - an institution , it turned out , which did not exist			1
he joined @entity1 in 1951 , and was one of the first car designers to use aerodynamics			2
he sadly died from a heart attack in 1970 - five years before the e-type went out of production			2
the car came into being as a result of @entity1 's incredible racing success throughout the 1950s			2
the company 's racing department was tasked with using the @entity144 @entity143 24 - hours winning d - type ’s construction approaches to build a road - going sports car to replace the @entity149			1
the e-type , made in @entity151 , was initially a two - seater , rear wheel drive coupe , though a four seater version was released later			0
the original cars cost around £ 2,100 - significantly less than what was being put on the market by competitors like @entity158 and @entity159			0
the @entity160 hit the @entity103 market in july 1961 , and continued to be produced for seven years			0
it had a 3.8 - litre engine , which was upped to 4.2 litres in 1964 , a top speed of around 150mph and could reach 0 - 60mph in around seven seconds			0
the main change for the 1968 - 71 @entity166 was the front lights - which were no longer protected by glass , and a redesigned interior , before the @entity170 was introduced with a new 12 cylinder , 5.3 - litre engine			0
the series 3 was notable for its slatted front grill and flared wheel arches , and also had power steering			0
of the three models , it is the series 1 which is most iconic and also most desirable today			0
essentially , it was speed restrictions in the 1970s which spelt the e-type 's end - it could not meet new @entity186 safety regulations , and the @entity187 was built in its place			0
in motorsport , @entity190 driver @entity189 won the @entity192 in a lightweight e-type , and the car also performed well in @entity196 sports car racing			0
a series 3 won the b - production championship in 1975 .			0
