@entity1 golden boy @entity0 has emerged as a transfer target for @entity3 following his weekend heroics in @entity5			1
a £ 1.5million move for the @entity8 winger was discussed by @entity10 coaching staff when @entity11 scoured the market for wing reinforcements last month			1
@entity3 eventually settled on loan deals for @entity16 @entity15 and @entity17			1
attracting interest : @entity1 star @entity0 is wanted by @entity3 @entity20 ’s stock has risen following a composed strike against the world champions in @entity23 , however , and @entity24 understands the @entity26 champions have asked @entity28 ’s representatives to keep them informed of his situation			1
linked with @entity32 , @entity33 and @entity34 in the summer , the 26 - year - old is keen on a return to @entity36 , the city where he was born to a @entity39 father and @entity41 mother			1
and @entity1 manager @entity42 believes @entity28 is destined for bigger things than the @entity44 after his second @entity1 goal in seven appearances			1
magic moment : @entity28 scored against @entity5 in sunday 's qualifier ‘ the coaching staff scratch our heads at times and wonder why he is not playing in the @entity54 , ’ said @entity42 last night			1
‘ it ’s not mugs he ’s playing against here - it ’s @entity5 , @entity59 , @entity60 and @entity61			1
the @entity62 were no mugs either and he scored against them , too			2
‘ there is no doubt about it			2
he could go to a @entity3 or to a club in the @entity54 no bother			1
‘ he can play different positions , too , which makes him even more valuable			2
he can play on the left as he did against @entity5 , he can play on the right side , he can even play left - back			1
he has not got a problem with any of them			2
mobbed : @entity28 is pounced on by his @entity1 team - mates after stunning the @entity77 ‘ and he has a love for the game which is so refreshing			1
i think he ’s worked so hard to get to where he is right now that he does n’t want to lose it			2
’ @entity28 ’s 66th - minute strike against the @entity77 raised hopes – briefly – of a stunning start to the @entity86 qualifying campaign			1
racing on to a @entity88 pass , he outpaced the @entity77 defence and slotted the ball with aplomb past @entity92 , widely hailed as the world ’s best goalkeeper			0
‘ when he was running through i thought to myself : “ @entity96 , you ’ve just sprinted for 30 yards and now you ’re up against the best goalie in the world ” , ’ said @entity42			0
high praise : @entity1 boss @entity42 says @entity28 would n't look out of place in the @entity54 ‘ but he stuck it away as if it was in a training game			2
the ball has n’t trickled into the back of the net either , he knew exactly what he was doing			0
‘ his personality is really infectious			0
every morning myself and the staff are the first ones up for breakfast			0
we make sure of it			0
sometimes we are even there before breakfast opens up			0
‘ but every morning @entity0 is the first player through those doors			0
‘ he looks like he ’s a guy who ca n’t wait to get out of his bed in the morning , to go training and to meet people			0
other ones trawl in at different times but his personality is : “ right , i want to make the most of what i ’ve got ”			0
‘ maybe it ’s because he came into professional football so late on in life			0
you have to take a few knocks in life to appreciate what you ’ve got and that might be the cas			0
