the prime minister says rural voters opposed to new planning rules are killing off the dream of home ownership rural voters opposed to new planning rules are killing off the chances of young people achieving the ‘ dream of home ownership ’ , insists @entity9			1
the prime minister accused grassroots conservatives and countryside groups that oppose building on greenfield land of putting their own interests before the country ’s			0
echoing sir @entity19 ’s calls for the @entity20 to do more to boost social mobility , mr @entity9 insisted the plans should be viewed ‘ in the round ’ because more houses have to be built			1
asked what he would say to conservatives in the countryside who claim they can not vote @entity29 because of the government ’s liberalisation of planning rules , mr @entity9 insisted he would not give ground			1
he said : ‘ planning reform is important			0
it ’s important that we build more houses because the average age of the first - time buyer has crept into the 30s , and i believe in a socially mobile society where people can achieve their dream of home ownership			2
’ however , campaigners say local people are now unable to block new building on greenfield land – undeveloped areas of agricultural or forest land – after the @entity20 introduced an assumption in favour of ‘ sustainable development ’ , which moved away from the notion that developers had to first look for brownfield sites – areas that had been previously developed			1
mr @entity9 spoke out as a report published by 41 environmental organisations , including the @entity60 and @entity61 , found that the government is failing to deliver nearly a third of its natural environment commitments , including protection of the green belt , farm animal welfare and reversing the decline in wildlife			1
alongside the report , the organisations published a poll of more than 2,000 people which found that 83 per cent believe the natural environment should be protected at all costs			0
@entity75 , chief executive of the @entity60 , said : ‘ we need to build many more houses , including affordable homes in villages and market towns , but all that the government ’s planning reforms are delivering is more strife			2
the only difference planning liberalisation has made is that houses that would have been built in towns and cities , aiding urban regeneration , are now sprawling into the countryside instead			2
‘ @entity9 needs to take off his rose - tinted spectacles and see what is really happening to it – not local choice and discretion but far too many poor - quality developments plonked down on green fields in the teeth of opposition from local people			2
’ campaigners say local people are now unable to block new building on greenfield land after the @entity20 introduced an assumption in favour of ' sustainable development ' demand : @entity9 and deputy prime minister @entity106 have both said @entity107 must build new homes deputy prime minister @entity106 , whose @entity110 seat borders the @entity111 , admitted that discontent over planning reforms ‘ is a very sensitive issue ’			1
he added : ‘ we have to build more homes but we must n’t throw the baby out with the bath water as far as the green belt is concerned			0
’ but mr @entity106 insisted ministers needed to act because while not enough homes are being built , local opposition means developers often can not work on sites despite planning permission being granted			0
he said : ‘ it needs to be more efficient , where developers are not held up year after year when we need people employed on building sites [ and ] we need more homes built across the country			0
‘ we have a problem , which is that we have built far too few new homes for far too long			0
