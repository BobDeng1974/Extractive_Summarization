by @entity0 @entity2 , from @entity1 , had to be rushed to hospital after swallowing a piece of wire brush a woman in @entity1 had to have emergency surgery after swallowing a wire bristle from a barbecue brush that got stuck to her grilled chicken			1
@entity2 was rushed to the emergency room after eating what she thought was a piece of crispy chicken , but turned out to be a metal wire			1
doctors found the offending object after @entity2 complained of pain radiating from her esophagus every time she swallowed			1
she told @entity21 : ' it was really the best grilled chicken he 'd ever made , i was like wow ! this is so good and i 'm eating it and the third bite i bit down on something hard			0
' i thought at first it was a charred piece of the chicken or something and as i swallowed it i realized no , this is not something i should be swallowing			0
' @entity2 's husband had used a wire scraper to clean the grill before cooking , but left one of the bristles behind which then got stuck to the food			2
doctors quickly removed the offending object , after which @entity2 says she felt much better			2
the wire ( pictured ) stuck to the grill after @entity2 's husband cleaned it , then got stuck to the chicken experts say the wire fell off the brush after the heat of the grill loosened the plastic holding it in place @entity51 warn that using metal brushes on grill can be dangerous , especially if the bristles are mounted in plastic			1
if the grill is hot the plastic will loosen , allowing them to slip out and stick to the grill bars and then to food			0
they advise only using a wire brush on a cold grill , or using a wooden spatula			0
while it comes with a straight edge , it will eventually char to fit around the grill bars .			0
