the guns used in a 2010 mass murder of mostly young men and women - came from the @entity4 in its failed gun - tracking program known as @entity7 , a shocking report has revealed			1
it has now been discovered that three of the guns used in the relentless assault came from @entity7 , the botched @entity14 gun - trafficking operation			1
the @entity16 massacre in january 2010 was one of the darkest days of the @entity19 drug war , after about 20 armed cartel members stormed a birthday party in @entity22 at about midnight and began firing at random , killing 16 people			1
fourteen of the victims were teenagers			0
the report , translated by @entity41 said that weapons used in the devastating shooting were linked to @entity7 through serial numbers			2
a @entity14 spokesman told @entity46 that the agency is trying to review the @entity35 report , and ' can not confirm or deny anything that ’s been reported ' at this point			0
the mastermind behind the attack , drug boss @entity51 was sentenced to seven life terms in april for his role in the birthday party shooting and other acts of murder and violence that he ordered			1
sentencing : with his charges including murder , conspiracy to kill and various racketeering , money laundering and drug charges @entity51 was sentenced to seven concurrent life terms and three additional consecutive life terms @entity51 was a chief in @entity51 , an arm of the @entity72			0

in total , @entity51 has been linked to ' 1,500 murders since 2008 , ' according to the plea document			0
a damning september 19 report led two top @entity14 officials to be ousted from their jobs - but attorney general @entity89 was ruled blameless in the gun - trafficking scandal			1
two senior officials left the department , one by resignation and one by retirement , upon release of the 471 - page internal report			2
its author , inspector general @entity97 , also referred 14 people for possible department disciplinary action for their roles in @entity7 and a separate , earlier probe known as @entity7 , undertaken during the @entity104 administration			1
escape : attorney general @entity89 was cleared of any wrongdoing in the @entity7 probe , but the report found that he should have been briefed on the investigation @entity110 : some 1,400 of the 2,000 guns lost in @entity7 are yet to be recovered the high risk operation saw guns being allowed to be purchased by @entity19 gangsters and @entity115 agents were supposed to track them to higher level drug cartel members and catch the bigger fish red - handed			1
but , it backfired and resulted in hundreds of weapons turning up at crime scenes in the @entity4 and @entity19			0
and in the worst failure @entity124 agent @entity7 , who was gunned down in december 2010 with two guns that agents had been trying to track			2
@entity7 's murder was the catalyst that began the internal probe into the gun operation after two of the 2,000 weapons thought to have been acquired by illicit buyers were found at the murder scene			1
about 1,400 of the total are yet to be recovered			0
no criminal charges were recommended in the report			0
victim : @entity4 @entity124 agent @entity7 was gunned down with one of the weapons used in @entity7 in december 2010 the documents did not criticise @entity89 , but said lower - level officials should have briefed him about the investigation much earlier			1
investigators found that @entity89 did n't know anything about @entity7 until late january / early february and found no evidence that that the attorney general was told about the much - disputed ' gun - walking ' tactic employed by the department 's @entity149			1
the inspector general found fault with the work of the senior @entity149 leadership , the @entity149 staff and @entity4 attorney 's office in @entity158 and senior officials of @entity14 's criminal division in @entity161			0
he also said that poor internal information - gathering and drafting at @entity14 and @entity149 caused the department to initially misinform @entity164 about @entity7			2
one of those criticized in the report , former @entity149 acting director @entity165 , who headed that office during the @entity7 investigation , retired upon release of the report			1
' @entity165 made too many assumptions about the case , ' the report stated			2
' @entity165 should have asked basic questions about the investigation , including how public safety was being protected			0
' another of those criticized , @entity14 career attorney @entity178 , resigned			0
@entity178 was a deputy assistant attorney general in @entity14 's criminal division in @entity161			1
' @entity178 was the most senior person in the department in april and may 2010 who was in a position to identify the similarity between the inappropriate tactics used in @entity187 and @entity7 , ' the report said			2
@entity178 's lawyer , @entity188 , called the report 's criticism ' profoundly wrong ' and ' deeply flawed			0
' resigned : deputy assistant attorney general @entity178 , the top @entity14 official with the power to stop @entity7 @entity194 : weapons tied to the gun trafficking operation known @entity7 were discovered in april in the home of @entity198 , in the volatile city of @entity22 , @entity19 in @entity7 and at least three earlier probes during the administration of @entity104 , agents in @entity201 employed a risky tactic called gun - walking - allowing low - level ' straw ' buyers - believed to be working for notorious @entity19 drug cartels - to leave with loads of weapons purchased at gun shops			1
but because of thin @entity149 staffing and weak penalties , the traditional strategy of arresting suspected straw buyers as soon as possible had failed to stop the flow of tens of thousands of guns to @entity19 - more than 68,000 in the past five years			0
the goal was to track the guns to major weapons traffickers and drug cartels in order to bring cases against kingpins who had long eluded prosecution under the former strategy of arresting low - level purchasers of guns who were suspected of buying them for others			0
the report also said that poor internal information - gathering and drafting at the @entity14 and @entity149 caused the department to initially misinform @entity164 about @entity7			2
out : @entity165 , the acting director of the @entity149 ' retired upon the release of the report , which heavily criticised him for assuming too much rep @entity235 , chairman of the @entity237 , and vocal critic of the operation , said : ' the inspector general 's report confirms findings by @entity164 ' investigation of a near total disregard for public safety in @entity7			1
' the report 's conclusion reads : ' our review of @entity7 and related matters revealed a series of misguided strategies , tactics , errors in judgment , and management failures that permeated @entity257 and the @entity258 , as well as the @entity259 for the @entity260			2
' one of the five suspects in @entity7 's murder was arrested two weeks ago			1
@entity263 , who was arrested on september 6 in @entity265 state			0
another suspect is currently on trial , while three more - @entity268 , 31 , @entity269 , 34 , @entity270 , 34 - remain at large			0
