they found that a jury should determine whether the @entity88 failed to supervise their son 's use of the computer and internet account relating to the alleged defamation			1
‘ given that the false and offensive statements remained on display , and continued to reach readers , for an additional eleven months , we conclude that a jury could find that the [ parents ' ] negligence proximately caused some part of the injury [ the girl ] sustained from [ the boy 's ] actions ( and inactions ) , ’ wrote judge @entity110			0
