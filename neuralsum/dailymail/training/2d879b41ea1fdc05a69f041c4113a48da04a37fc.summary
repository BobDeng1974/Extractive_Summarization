by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity2 took advantage of the first - half dismissal of @entity7 centre @entity5 to earn a precious win that takes them a step closer to securing top spot in the @entity12			1
the @entity14 winners were forced to play for an hour with 12 men after @entity16 was sent off by referee @entity17 midway through the first half for an illegal shoulder charge on @entity2 centre @entity20 , who had to be substituted			1
with skipper @entity23 and stalwart @entity24 at the heart of a superb defensive effort , the @entity22 looked capable of hanging on but the task proved beyond them as @entity28 came from 12 - 2 down to snatch a 13 - 12 victory that takes them five points clear of nearest rivals @entity33			2
red mist : @entity5 ( right ) of @entity7 is sent off in the first half following a dangerous tackle from @entity20 stand - off @entity37 was @entity2 ' hero on his return to the side with a drop goal seven minutes from the end which followed two quick tries against a tiring @entity7 defence by @entity45 and @entity46			1
now only @entity47 can prevent @entity49 's men from clinching the league leaders ' shield but they will need to win their last three games and hope @entity28 slip up in both their last two			0
@entity7 , who were without two of their cup final heroes , @entity55 and @entity57 because of injury , have now lost three successive league matches to take some of the shine off their @entity62 triumph			0
saints took the lead with a fifth - minute penalty goal from @entity20 but then spent most of the first half on defence			1
with hooker @entity69 revelling in his rare opportunity to start a match and @entity24 and @entity72 tearing into the @entity28 defence , the home side were full of attacking threats and that did not change even when they were reduced to 12 men with @entity5 shown a red card for his ugly challenge on @entity20			2
@entity23 kicked his side into a 4 - 2 lead with a couple of penalties and the @entity22 scored the only try of the first half on 29 minutes when @entity86 's probing run stretched the @entity2 defence and half - back @entity89 went past a wrong - footed @entity45 to touch down			1
@entity23 's conversion made it 10 - 2 and he added another two points with a third penalty on the stroke of half - time			2
saints rarely threatened and when a break out of defence from winger @entity99 eventually set up a promising position for them , they failed to make the most of it when @entity104 got in the way of team - mate @entity107 's dash for the line			0
the visitors improved dramatically in the second half , with full - back @entity111 making an impact on attack in his second appearance for the club			0
@entity7 defended magnificently , though , and @entity23 temporarily relieved the pressure with his first 40 - 20 kick of the season			0
however , the momentum was firmly with @entity28 and it was no surprise when they eventually prized open the home side 's defence , with @entity123 putting @entity45 through a gap for a try on 62 minutes			0
@entity104 fluffed the comparatively easy goal - kick but @entity99 was on target seven minutes later to convert @entity46 's try from dummy half to tie the scores and @entity37 kept his nerve to land the all - important drop goal .			1

@entity37 seals victory with late drop goal
@entity5 sent off in first half after dangerous tackle
