you ’ve seen images of @entity2 from the @entity3 , but one astronaut has set the bar to a new height with his shots of storms taken from above			1
@entity9 has released stunning pictures and video of lightning captured by a @entity14 astronaut while on the @entity3 255 miles ( 410km ) above @entity2			1
and one image makes @entity2 look more like a toy than a planet - as the landscape of @entity2 is revealed around a huge flash of lightning			1
@entity9 has revealed an amazing video of 49 images stitched together showing lightning strikes over @entity23			1
the images were taken by @entity14 astronaut @entity25 in 2012 but have only just been released the incredible series of images were captured by astronaut @entity25 on the @entity3 on 11 june 2012 , during @entity29			1
the lightning was captured over @entity23 at about 8:55pm @entity31 , and a video was made by stitching together 49 images taken on the @entity3 while travelling at 27,600 km / h ( 17,100 mph )			1
estimates suggest that 100 discharges can occur between the system of clouds and the surface of @entity2 each second , causing many lightning strikes , so for astronauts seeing such a sight is not all too rare			1
as the clouds are so vast , however , they are not always visible from the surface			0
but from the @entity3 the lightning is much more visible - and when astronauts orbit @entity2 , they can often spot lightning in clouds from above			1
as @entity9 explains , though , capturing images from the @entity3 at a height of 255 miles ( 410km ) can be difficult			2
‘ at these distances a camera flash is pointless to take night - time images of @entity2 , but our planet moves by so quickly images can end up being blurred , ’ they said			2
to help astronauts take images , they use something called a @entity60 camera			1
this uses a tripod system and is installed in the cupola module of the iss. astronauts can then move it using motors to point at different locations on @entity2			0
when the camera is pointed at a target on @entity2 , it will automatically compensate for the movement of the station , ensuring the image remains steady and clear			1
@entity73 actually flew with @entity74 to the @entity3 when he launched in december 2011 , making him one of the first astronauts that got to use it on the @entity3 @entity25 mission at the time was also especially notable , because in may he welcomed the first ever private spacecraft to the @entity81			2
he was actually responsible for berthing the vehicle to the @entity3 at the time - the first person in history to dock a private spacecraft			2
while seeing lightning from @entity2 is somewhat rare , from space many more strikes can be seen			1
this image shows the entirety of @entity2 looking like a toy ( pictured ) as the lightning - filled cloud is spotted below			1
to the top left is the light of the sun in @entity2 's atmosphere the images were taken using the @entity60 camera - illustrated left - which automatically matches the station 's movement to reduce blur			1
@entity14 astronaut @entity25 is pictured right on the @entity3 with the camera in 2012 these latest pictures follow amazing images of lighting in the eye of a cyclone revealed earlier this week , also captured by an astronaut on the iss. the incredible views of tropical cyclone @entity112 were spotted in the @entity114 near the island of @entity116 , when the @entity3 was east of @entity117			1
in the images the calm ‘ eye ’ of the storm can be seen illuminated by lightning and surrounded by swirling clouds as it made its way across the ocean			0
they were taken by @entity128 @entity9 astronaut @entity127 aboard the @entity3 earlier this month			2
an @entity128 astronaut on the @entity3 captured images of a cyclone on @entity2			1
tropical cyclone @entity112 was spotted in the @entity114 by @entity9 's @entity127 while the @entity3 was east of @entity117			1
the images show flashes of lighting illuminating the eye of the storm ( shown ) as the astronauts passed overhead tropical cyclones are low pressure systems that develop in the tropics in the @entity141			0
they produce gale force winds of about 39mph ( 63km/h ) on average and rotate in a clockwise direction			0
if the winds reach 73mph ( 118km/h ) , the system is called a severe tropical cyclone			0
the strongest winds are always near the eye , but damaging winds can extend hundreds of kilometres from the cyclone ’s centre			0
cyclones form in warm oceans when sea - surface temperature exceeds @entity158 and there are favourable wind conditions			0
they can persist for several days but lose their energy when they move over land or colder oceans , or are disrupted by other wind			0
they show the swirling motion of the storm around the central blue eye			0
according to @entity173 , the wall of the eye is being illuminated by a flash of lightning in the centre of the storm - which also lights up nearby clouds			0
the low - light settings of the camera used to take the image accentuate the contrast			2
‘ it looks like the storm is powering up some sort of weapon ! ’ said @entity182 at @entity183			0
one image also shows a thin green line over the horizon known as airglow , which occurs when oxygen atoms are energised by the sun. the camera again accentuates this effect , which is an atmospheric phenomenon frequently seen by astronauts			2
stars appear above the airglow layer , and the solar panels of a docked @entity200 spacecraft jut into the image			0
@entity202 formed in the southwestern @entity114 on 11 january this year			0
by the time @entity127 's photos were taken , on the following day , @entity112 had achieved tropical cyclone strength , with sustained maximum winds over 115 miles ( 185km ) per hour			0
the cyclone would reach category 4 strength before becoming a weak extra-tropical system on 19 january			0
@entity202 formed in the southwestern @entity114 on 11 january this year , just off the coast of @entity117 ( shown )			0
the cyclone reached category 4 strength ( shown in orange and red ) before becoming a weak extra-tropical system on 19 january ( right in blue ) another image by @entity127 ( shown ) also revealed a green line of ' airglow ' above @entity2 near the cyclone , with part of a @entity200 spacecraft also in the image			2
@entity222 occurs when oxygen atoms are energised by the sun. @entity112 formed on 11 january and became a tropical cyclone before weakening by 19 january @entity9 astronaut @entity127 , pictured , was born in @entity228 , @entity128 on 26 april 1977			0
she was selected as an @entity9 astronaut in may 2009 and , on 23 november 2014 , she launched on her first mission to the @entity3 aboard a @entity232 spacecraft as part of @entity234 on 15 january at 6.15am @entity31 ( 1.15am est ) , @entity173 's @entity236 satellite captured this visible picture of tropical cyclone @entity239 east - northeast of the island of @entity116			1

@entity9 has revealed an amazing video of 49 images stitched together showing lightning strikes over @entity246
the images were taken by @entity14 astronaut @entity25 on the @entity3 in 2012 but have only just been released
they were taken using the @entity60 camera - which automatically matches the station 's movement to reduce blur
while lightning on @entity2 seems rare , from space many more strikes can be seen in vast cloud systems
