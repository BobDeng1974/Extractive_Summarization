the most common form of cancer in women , breast cancer , is easier to treat than the most common form in men , prostate cancer women are far more likely to survive cancer than men are , research shows			1
nearly twice as many women as men are still alive at least ten years after being diagnosed			0
this is largely because the most common form of cancer in women – breast cancer – is easier to treat than the most common form in men , prostate cancer			1
research by @entity18 shows that 260,000 women are still alive ten years after their cancer diagnosis , compared with 140,000 men			2
the charity says this is partly because almost 80 per cent of the 50,000 women diagnosed annually with breast cancer can expect to live at least another decade			2
in contrast , just over 65 per cent of the 41,000 men diagnosed with prostate cancer will survive for this length of time			1
men are also more likely to be diagnosed with lung cancer , which has only a 10 per cent survival rate			1
there are nearly 23,000 new cases of cancer in men each year compared with 19,000 in @entity40 general , men are notoriously reluctant to see a doctor whenever they are ill. this means that if they have cancer , they are more likely to ignore the symptoms and it may not be picked up until it has spread and is untreatable			0
@entity45 , of @entity18 said : ‘ breast cancer is the big success story of cancer			2
since the 1980s , the average survival rate has been above ten years			2
lots of people get it , almost exclusively women , but they will live a long time			0
‘ but if you compare that with the big male cancer , prostate , survival is n’t as good			0
’ the findings of the study will be presented tomorrow at the @entity61 conference in @entity62			0
there were 288,600 new cancer diagnoses in @entity65 in 2010 , the latest figures available , compared with 246,400 in 2000 and 212,700 in 1990			0
@entity67 have previously warned that men with prostate cancer receive far worse care than women with breast cancer but cancer survival rates have quadrupled in the past 40 years			1
@entity67 have previously warned that men with prostate cancer receive far worse care than women with breast cancer			1
a report in 2009 by the @entity77 on @entity78 said that treatment for men was less prompt and they were not offered as much support			0
figures also show that while breast cancer research receives an average of £ 815 per case diagnosed , prostate cancer only gets £ 417			1
last week , @entity87 published figures showing that by 2020 , one in two @entity89 will develop cancer at some time in their life .			0

breast cancer is easier to treat than prostate cancer
research was carried out by @entity18
men are more likely to be diagnosed with lung cancer which has only a 10 per cent survival rate
