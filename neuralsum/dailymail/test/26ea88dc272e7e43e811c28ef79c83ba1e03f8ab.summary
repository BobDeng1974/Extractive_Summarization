@entity1 boss @entity0 accepts the pressure is on as his side head into their final six games with their top - flight status still not secured			1
the @entity7 slipped to a fifth successive @entity9 defeat at @entity10 on monday , a result that did little to ease fears they could yet be sucked into relegation trouble			0
newcastle remain in the relative safety of 13th place with 35 points but the sides below them have been eating into their cushion			2
they are nine points above the relegation zone but with some awkward - looking games in their run - in , including this weekend 's home clash with @entity27 and matches against fellow battlers @entity30 , @entity31 and @entity32			1
@entity1 boss @entity0 insists his side have ' got six cup finals ' left to play during the current campaign @entity0 , pictured with @entity1 ace @entity37 , has won just two games since taking over the reins newcastle are just nine points above @entity32 @entity0 said : ' we have got six cup finals			1
we have got four home games , two away , and it is important when we play those home games our fans are right behind us			0
' it looked like being a long night for @entity1 and their fans as @entity10 dominated the early proceedings at @entity51 , with @entity52 setting up their 2 - 0 win with a brilliant ninth - minute opener			1
@entity10 spurned several good chances to increase their lead and @entity1 rallied before the break and were controversially denied a penalty when referee @entity59 surprisingly did not point to the spot after @entity61 appeared to bring down @entity62			2
@entity62 also had a fine header superbly saved by @entity64 but @entity10 secured victory through @entity66 after 70 minutes , and @entity1 's misery was complete when @entity37 was shown a late red card			1
@entity0 at least felt his side had shown the right spirit after their recent derby loss to @entity72			1
@entity73 winger @entity52 scored in @entity10 's 2 - 0 win over @entity1 at @entity51 on monday night he said : ' the pleasing thing from my point of view was our response			1
we have responded from that dreadful performance against @entity72			0
anything would have been better than what we saw against @entity72			0
' it is still not a win , but there are an awful lot of things that we can take into the final six games			0
' @entity0 , who has overseen just two wins in 14 games since taking over from @entity92 , is also fighting for his own future			2
@entity0 feels his side are getting a rough deal from referees , with the @entity62 penalty claim the latest example			1
he said : ' i think @entity10 fans understand the game like @entity1 fans do and the reaction of them told me it was a penalty			2
even @entity103 ( @entity104 ) said straight away it was a penalty			0
' these guys have to do a job - i am not going to be critical in general - i am just talking about one big decision			0
contracts and jobs and livelihoods are decided on decisions like that			0
' it is always the people on this side of the fence that get punished for that			0

@entity0 's @entity1 have lost their last five matches
newcastle are nine points above 18th - placed @entity32
@entity0 has warned his side that they must start to pick up points
