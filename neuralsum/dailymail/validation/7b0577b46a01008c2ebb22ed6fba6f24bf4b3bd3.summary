@entity2 centre @entity0 could miss the @entity3 – after collapsing with suspected ligament damage to his left knee in training on thursday			1
@entity0 had been named in the @entity7 to face @entity8 in saturday 's @entity10 clash at @entity11			1
but , running on his own just an hour before selection was announced this morning , he changed direction and his knee simply gave way			1
the damage is being scanned at a private hospital in @entity18 , while a specialist will need to examine the images before making a final diagnosis			2
@entity0 faces a race against time to be fit for the @entity3 after injuring his knee at training while @entity2 coaching staff are hopeful that he may only have torn his cartilage , putting him out of action for around six weeks , there is a real fear that @entity0 has sustained damage to his acl – which means up to six months on the sidelines			1
@entity32 , who had been due to start on the bench , will take @entity0 's place in the starting line - up on saturday			1
@entity2 centre @entity0 was due to start against @entity8 in the @entity10 on saturday @entity37 , @entity38 and @entity39 will all start for @entity2 against @entity8 on saturday after @entity40 made five changes to his starting xv			1
stand - off @entity43 also returns to the @entity46 line - up for the penultimate @entity48 clash at @entity11 after suspension ruled him out of the 22 - 19 defeat to @entity51 at @entity52 two weeks ago			1
the @entity53 are desperate to restore pride in the @entity10 meeting following three straight defeats to @entity57 , @entity58 and the @entity51			1
@entity18 number eight @entity59 - the only player among the incoming five not to have featured in this year 's competition - replaces @entity63 after shaking off the calf strain which has kept him out of action so far			2
@entity59 's @entity69 team - mates @entity66 - a try - scorer against @entity57 in round one - and @entity32 replace injured wing @entity70 and centre @entity0 , who are both ruled out with knee complaints			1
@entity43 , meanwhile , starts in place of @entity76 while experienced @entity77 lock @entity38 takes the place of benched forward @entity79			2
@entity40 said : ' @entity38 comes in and will bring his physicality and understanding of @entity83 rugby to our forward pack			2
' it 's good to have @entity87 back as he provides us with strong ball - carrying and strong defence			2
he 's also a very good lineout forward and will give us a bit more physical density against a big forward pack			0
' it 's been tough on @entity43 to sit out and it 's great to have him back			0
he 's slotted straight back in to the structure we 're looking for			0
' finally , @entity39 came on and played well against @entity57 and has had a couple of games with his club			0
' we 're looking for him to bring his enthusiasm , energy and high work - rate , particularly in kick - chase and receipt			0
' tighthead prop @entity107 , meanwhile , will equal @entity109 's all - time appearance record for a @entity2 prop when he collects his 65th cap			2
@entity0 , here showing his disappointment after @entity2 's loss to @entity58 , awaits results of scans on his knee he will partner @entity117 and fit - again @entity118 , who has recovered from the back spasm suffered against @entity51 to start in an experienced front - row			1
@entity121 remains in the second - row to pack down with @entity38 , while @entity122 and @entity123 start together for the sixth consecutive time in the back - row , alongside @entity59			0
captain @entity126 will again partner the returning @entity43 from scrum - half , with the back - line completed by @entity130 trio @entity129 , @entity131 and @entity132			0
@entity132 , @entity66 , @entity129 , @entity32 , @entity133 , @entity43 , @entity126			0
@entity117 , @entity134 , @entity107 , @entity38 , @entity121 , @entity135 , @entity136 and @entity37 subs : @entity138 , @entity139 , @entity140 , @entity79 , @entity63 , @entity141 , @entity142 , @entity143 @entity40 added : ' this is a very important game			0
' it will be played away from home at a very intense level and will allow us to assess further our ability to operate away from home in a hostile environment			0
' our focus , however , has been on ourselves and how we can perform better , by identifying the areas that we can control - like improving our skill sets and reinforcing our cohesion - to withstand the difficult times and also apply some pressure			0
