by @entity0 published : 18:54 est , 14 february 2013 updated : 05:10 est , 15 february 2013 this is the grisly scene played out every day inside the @entity3 slaughterhouse which sent six horses containing danger drug bute into the human food chain			1
a slaughterman balances a rifle against the pony ’s head and pulls the trigger			0
the animal flails on the ground and is then winched on to the production line where her throat is cut with a razor sharp knife , severing the carotid artery			0
the company @entity19 of @entity20 kills 63 horses a week using this method , with the carcasses shipped to @entity24 for food			1
meat from three of the six horses found to contain the anti-inflammatory drug phenylbutazone , known as bute , has been sold and eaten , while meat from the second three has been recalled			1
mr @entity32 said he bought ponies , thoroughbreds and riding stable horses that are old or injured			1
‘ people come to us to dispose of their horses because they feel we do it very well , ’ he said			2
‘ we wish to produce meat that is wholesome , nutritious , good value and , most importantly , safe			2
‘ we firmly believe that the humane destruction of horses for the human food chain has an important role to play in ensuring horse welfare , as otherwise unwanted horses would be left to enter a downward spiral to neglect			2
’ the details have triggered a fierce political row , with @entity61 accusing the government of ‘ catastrophic complacency ’ in its handling of the horsemeat scandal			2
grisly : @entity66 of @entity20 kills 63 horses a week using this method , with the carcasses shipped to @entity24 for food			1
the business is run by @entity32 , pictured			1
this is a file picture @entity61 ’s @entity74 , @entity75 , warned ministers of the danger of bute contamination on january 24 , however horses containing the drug continued to be slaughtered and exported for food			1
it was not until this week that a new regime , which stops horsemeat being sold until tests show it is negative for bute , was introduced			1
she challenged food minister @entity90 in the @entity91 yesterday , saying : ‘ we must make sure horsemeat intended for humans is not contaminated with bute , it really is as simple as that			1
‘ so why did you not act immediately when i raised this issue three weeks ago in this @entity99 ? ’ she added : ‘ it ’s astonishing			0
we were in the middle of a horsemeat adulteration scandal , this is just catastrophic complacency from you			2
’ mr @entity90 said the government is working with the @entity24 authorities to track the @entity110 horse carcasses killed at mr @entity32 ’s abattoir			1
he also insisted that @entity110 is leading the way in getting @entity114 co-operation to track down the criminals responsible for the scandal			0
@entity117 : mr @entity32 , pictured , said he sells his horsemeat through 50 butchers in the @entity36 area			1
this is a file picture ‘ we have probably the biggest investigation that has ever been conducted across @entity114 into criminal behaviour , going on at the instigation of this government , ’ said mr @entity90			0
he described @entity110 ’s role as a ‘ quite remarkable achievement in a very short time ’			0
throughout the crisis , ministers have argued the horsemeat contamination is a matter of food fraud rather than a health risk			2
news that @entity110 horses containing bute have entered the food chain suggests these were premature			1
in theory , high doses , far more than would be present in a horsemeat burger , can induce blood disorders , including aplastic anaemia			0
this means the bone marrow stops making enough red blood cells , white blood cells and platelets for the body , putting people at risk of life - threatening infections			0
however , the government ’s chief medical officer , dame @entity154 , yesterday insisted any risk to consumers is small			0
‘ horsemeat containing phenylbutazone – bute - presents a very low risk to human health , ’ she said			1
row : @entity61 ’s @entity74 , @entity75 , right , warned ministers of the danger of bute contamination on january 24			0
she challenged food minister @entity90 , left , in the @entity91 yesterday ‘ at the levels of bute that have been found , a person would have to eat 500 - 600 one hundred per cent horsemeat burgers a day to get close to consuming a human ’s daily dose			1
and it passes through the system fairly quickly , so it is unlikely to build up in our bodies			0
‘ in patients who have been taking phenylbutazone as a medicine there can be serious side effects but these are rare			0
it is extremely unlikely that anyone who has eaten horse meat containing bute will experience one of these side effects			1
’ mr @entity32 did not respond to calls asking about his methods and where the six horses were sent in @entity24			1
speaking in 2007 , he defended what he does , saying : ‘ we will all be old at some point and may spend our later years in great discomfort , horses are the same			0
‘ the horses are handled in a stress - free manner , by professional people and despatched with the minimum of fuss			0
none of us could ask for anything better than that			0
’ a @entity204 abattoir owner , @entity203 , has been accused of providing horses to a factory in @entity207 where they were passed off a beef and turned into burgers and kebabs			2
mr @entity203 is contracted to remove fatally injured horses from racecourses , including @entity213 and the @entity214			0
yesterday , the racing authorities said measures are in place to ensure horses killed on the track can not be sold for food .			2
