but it seems one man 's dancing style is so unique it has got him banned from his favourite city centre bar			1
@entity1 was a regular at @entity16 in @entity18 's city centre , and could be seen busting his moves on the dancefloor every weekend			1

' i love to dance because i get frustrated with life			0
i do n't like fighting , i 'm not a fighter so i dance			0
' @entity3 - which advertises on its website ' drink , dance , laugh , sing , party ' has always been one of mr @entity1 's favourite spots			1
but a night out to celebrate his birthday ended with mr @entity1 , who works as a dishwasher , allegedly being refused entry			2
' last weekend me and my mates went to go in @entity3 , where i 've been going for ages , but the bouncers would n't let us in , ' mr @entity1 said			1
' they said they 'd had lots of complaints about my dancing because of knocking over people 's drinks and stuff			2
' i have done that in the past and trodden on people 's toes but i always apologise and buy people their drinks back			0
' he added : ' when i spoke to the manager about it all he told me i was barred because some people who complained said they would n't come back if i was allowed to dance in there			2
' i said that i did n't just come to dance , i do karaoke as well and the manager said " yeah , i know mate , you ca n't sing " but that 's not the point of karaoke			0
' mr @entity1 has vowed to not let the dispute hinder his dancing			2
he said : ' even when i was young i used to come home from school and would go straight to my room and just dance away			0
' it 's developed from there and because i used to do martial arts , so i use that sometimes as well			0

' not only is dancing therapeutic for mr @entity1 but it entertains pub - goers around @entity18 who love to watch him at a weekend			1
