but this young girl nearly died after her spine started to curve like a snake			2
@entity8 , 13 , looked like she had a fin between her shoulders where her backbone stuck out			1
the teenager ’s vertebrae were curved at a 90 degree angle and twisted 50 degrees in the opposite direction further down – creating a giant ‘ s ’ shape			0
@entity8 trains with her local dance academy before her operation , @entity8 's spine had a double curve ( left )			1
she underwent an 11 hour operation to fit a titanium rod to her spine ( right ) doctors were unsure what caused her scoliosis – or curvature of the spine – but said it was the worst case they had ever seen			1
the condition developed in just half a year			0
her parents originally thought it was being caused by an ill - fitting bra			2
it was only when doctors examined her that they realised her life was at risk			2
they told @entity8 that if her spine curved any more it could puncture her lung			1
@entity8 was saved by an 11 - hour operation in which surgeons inserted a rod into her back to straighten it out			1
before the operation ( left ) @entity8 's ribs were crushing her lungs			1
now ( right ) she has recovered sufficiently to take part in a netball tournament in @entity48 her mother @entity49 , 45 , said : ‘ they had to pick me off the floor when they told me			0
‘ we thought the doctor was showing us an x-ray of the worst - case scenario but it was actually my daughter ’s spine on the screen			1
‘ i cried a lot			0
@entity8 is very fit and active so we never knew anything was wrong			1
she never felt any pain			0
@entity8 ( right , pictured with her mother , left ) underwent an 11 hour operation to straighten her spine ‘ when we got to the hospital and the doctor asked her to bend forward i could n’t believe what i was seeing			1
her spine was sticking out like a shark ’s fin			2
’ mrs @entity8 and her husband @entity74 , 45 , a project manager , said @entity8 ’s spine had been perfectly straight when they had gone on holiday together just six months earlier			1
it was @entity8 ’s dance teacher who realised her back was misaligned , as she had studied the condition on a physiotherapy course			1
in june last year the schoolgirl , from @entity84 , near @entity85 , underwent a day of surgery at nearby @entity87			0
she had a titanium rod inserted and fixed on to her spine with 18 screws			1
at one point during the operation , surgeons were forced to stop when a machine monitoring @entity8 ’s progress delivered a reading of paralysis			1
thankfully it was a false alarm			0
her mother said : ‘ i was so nervous when she went into theatre			0
it sounds awful to say , but one slip of the knife and she ’s paralysed			0
that ’s all it takes			0
’ @entity8 recovered rapidly from the surgery			1
doctors were amazed to find she could do the splits just two weeks after the operation			2
the teenager is now back to full fitness and enjoys dancing and playing sport			0
she has finished a stint performing in a pantomime , trains with her local dance school and is even competing in a netball tournament in @entity48 at the end of the month			0
she also took part in a @entity120 dip , raising £ 450 for the spinal unit to thank it for saving her life			0
mrs @entity8 added : ‘ we are so proud of her			2
even though her operation was so serious , she was determined to show other children with the same condition that you can still be active and enjoy your life			2
’ doctors are unable to explain why eight out of ten children develop scoliosis			2
it is not thought to be caused by posture , exercise or diet .			0

@entity8 , 13 , had one of the worst cases of scoliosis doctors had seen
her lungs were being crushed by her ribs and risked being punctured
