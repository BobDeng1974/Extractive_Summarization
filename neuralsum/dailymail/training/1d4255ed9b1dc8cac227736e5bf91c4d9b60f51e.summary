she denies murder a medical student ordered two ‘ gangster friends ’ to kill a ‘ besotted ’ television executive in revenge after he tried to rape her , a court heard yesterday			1
@entity2 , 20 , lured millionaire @entity13 to her house , where he was beaten unconscious then bundled into the boot of a car and burned alive , the jury was told			1
she allegedly told friends she wanted mr @entity13 dead – and , the court heard , persuaded another man who was infatuated with her to murder him			1
mr @entity13 , 21 , was killed in february , after the ‘ intelligent and attractive young woman ’ convinced him , through a series of text messages , to come to her student digs in @entity5 at 11pm , the jury was told			1
but when he walked into her bedroom , carrying a teddy bear and flowers , he found @entity29 – who was also in love with @entity2 – and ‘ hired muscle ’ @entity32 waiting for him , the court heard			1
during the beating mr @entity13 – the owner of a new broadcasting service called @entity37 – screamed @entity2 ’s name and begged for help , it was claimed			1
the two men , both 20 , wrapped the victim in @entity2 ’s duvet and bundled him into the boot of the @entity45 he arrived in , then drove to a quiet street in @entity47 , south - east @entity48 , doused the car in petrol and set it alight , the @entity40 was told			1
a post mortem examination revealed mr @entity13 was still alive when the fire was started			1
prosecutor @entity54 told the jury that the attack was carried out to ‘ exact revenge and retribution ’ on mr @entity13 , whom @entity2 knew ‘ remained besotted by her ’			1
‘ at the heart of this case there lies some unattractive and raw human emotions at work , ’ he said			2
@entity2 , of @entity66 in @entity67 , @entity29 , of @entity68 , south - east @entity48 , and @entity32 , of @entity47 , all deny murder			1
‘ @entity13 was plainly , on the evidence , besotted with her , ’ prosecutor @entity54 told jurors of the relationship that began in 2009			1
murdered : @entity13 , 21 , was in a car that was set on fire he wooed her with gifts , while she provided him with emotional support - particularly when his father was murdered on a visit to @entity81 in september 2009 - and would spend hours chatting with him on the phone and internet , the court heard			1
@entity13 's father 's packaging business had been turning over more than £ 2million year when money started going missing from the firm			1
his accountant was based in @entity81 and the father went to investigate but was murdered there			2
his son took over the firm and also started the @entity92 tv channel on @entity93			2
however @entity13 's relationship with his girlfriend @entity2 broke down in august 2010 after mr @entity13 ' attempted to rape ' her in her student house			1
a housemate , @entity98 , described @entity2 as an ' agony aunt ' and said : ' during our first year she talked to him about very intimate , personal things			1
' he was a millionaire who offered her lots of gifts which she refused			2
after his father died they became closer and he was dependent on her			2
' but mr @entity105 said the attempted rape changed everything			2
he said : ‘ it is common ground that he tried to have sex with her by getting into her bed			2
‘ both were to describe it as an attempted rape - although in fact her description of events , even to her friends , suggest it did not get as far as that			2
‘ it is common ground that he tried to have sex with her by getting into her bed			2
' ‘ she forced him away , he broke down in tears and he left			0
’ @entity2 became increasingly upset and angry , and spurned mr @entity13 ’s attempts to strike up further contact with her , jurors were told			1
she became so resentful that after the attempted rape she referred to him only as s * * * face , ' the court heard			0
' that she disliked him intensely there can be little doubt , ' the barrister said			0
' she can be extremely manipulative			0
she knew that he was completely besotted by her and would jump at the chance of contact with her			0
' at the same time , she also began a relationship with @entity29 , who mr @entity105 told jurors was also ‘ besotted ’ with her			0
‘ she told her housemates about how on occasions certain of her male friends , which she referred to as gangster friends , wished to exact revenge and retribution on him ( mr @entity13 ) but that she would discourage it , ’ he added			1
tributes : flowers next to the charred tree where the dead body of @entity157 was found in the boot of a burnt out car ‘ unfortunately by february this year , far from discouraging anyone from harming him , she lured him to @entity5 , suggesting a meeting at the same house at 11pm			2
’ the victim was both ‘ excited ’ and ‘ wary ’ , he said , adding : ‘ he asked her whether she was sure this was such a good idea			0
’ mr @entity105 added : ‘ on february 25 he drove down in his sister ’s @entity45			0
‘ but laying in wait for him in the basement of the house , where her bedroom was , were @entity175 and @entity32			0
‘ he had no idea what lay in store for him			0
he was attacked and beaten unconscious			2
‘ he was then wrapped up in @entity2 ’s duvet and carried by @entity175 and @entity32 and dumped in the boot of the @entity45 he had arrived in			1
’ after the car had been driven to @entity47 it was set on fire with mr @entity13 still in the boot			1
‘ @entity186 was poured on to the car , including onto him as he lay either still unconscious or on any view completely helpless inside the boot , ’ said mr @entity105			2
‘ it is scientifically clear beyond any doubt that he was still alive at that point			0
‘ the car was then set alight with him in the boot and that is how his life was ended			1
’ the prosecutor added that @entity2 was key to the killing and initiated it			1
' her role was central			0
if she had agreed to lure him to @entity5 that fateful evening the deceased would have been safe and alive today , ' mr @entity105 said			0
' no - one else had the ability to get the deceased to a place where he was completely vulnerable			0
' ‘ it is scientifically clear beyond any doubt that he was still alive at that point			0
the car was then set alight with him in the boot and that is how his life was ended			1
’ her new boyfriend , @entity29 , ' almost certainly had his own agenda and it was not of the righteous crusader protecting a young woman 's virtue , ' the barrister added			0
' he being besotted with her was more than happy to get rid of @entity13			1
' @entity32 was hired to help deal with the victim who was one grade below black belt at @entity224 , the court heard			0
' @entity2 was the person who lured the victim into the trap that had been laid , ' mr @entity105 said			2
' @entity32 and @entity175 were the hired muscle who would draw this plan to its awful conclusion			0
' @entity231 said on the night of the killing she saw sobbing @entity2 coming up from the basement			2
' she was shaking with tears in her eyes			0
she said " he 's been here			0
" she said she had a flashback ( to the attempted rape ) on seeing his face			0
' i could hear noise coming from down the stairs			0
it was very loud like someone was trying to tear the house down			0
it was a loud fight			0
' @entity2 told her she had asked mr @entity13 to come to the house and he had turned up with a teddy bear for her			1
' she said that she was told to get him into the house and get him downstairs and then open the door to her room and then run upstairs			0
' she described how once she had opened the door they had leapt straight on him and she remained on the stairs unable to move			0
' the deceased had been screaming her name asking for help , but she could n't bring herself to help			0
' later @entity2 told her the two men were taking the victim to the car , the court heard			1

@entity13 , 21 , beaten , put in a car , driven to @entity48 and set on fire
student @entity2 , 20 , ' got two men to take revenge '
