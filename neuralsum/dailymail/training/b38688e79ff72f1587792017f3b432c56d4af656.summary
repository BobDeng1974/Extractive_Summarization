offer : the county council 's leader @entity65 said he wanted to ' provide the best possible library ' for @entity16 ( pictured ) challenge : campaign group @entity51 ( @entity52 ) said that it will take the planning decision to judicial review , claiming that 97 per cent of 1,000 residents questioned were opposed to the plans the listed building is in desperate need of renovation and the county council argues that any proposed redevelopment of it would be limited by a covenant			1
having been built on land donated by 2nd @entity81 of @entity16 , he stipulated that it should only be used for ' the purpose of the erection of a public free library and public hall thereon '			2

' @entity119 and saving – or rather improving – @entity16 library are both worthwhile but it does not follow that they are one and the same thing			0
