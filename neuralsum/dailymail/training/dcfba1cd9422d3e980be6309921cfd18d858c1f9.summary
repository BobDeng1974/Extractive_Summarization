while many girls fret about being skinny in order to make it as a model , the career of @entity2 @entity1 reached new heights after she embraced her curves			2
the 24 - year - old has appeared on the cover of @entity11 , in campaigns for @entity13 and on the catwalk at @entity15 as a plus - size model			1
today she is signed to talent agency @entity17 and has been chosen as one of the stars of a new @entity21 campaign to promote the agency 's varied roster			1
speaking at the shoot , the size 16 star told @entity27 she had tried to be a ' regular ' model but her natural body shape did n't fit the mould			1
she was n't prepared to starve herself to continue a career in modelling - and luckily she did n't have to after plus - size jobs became available			1
plus - size model @entity1 is one of the @entity35 stars to feature in @entity21 's new campaign for the agency she revealed : ' i started out doing regular modelling as a teenager but i could n't maintain a size 6 to 8 figure and that 's what size all the samples are			1
' i 'm tall and i have big hips and shoulders			0
even if @entity48 diet i ca n't shrink my bones			2
i had tried to be that skinny i would have ended up in hospital			0
' instead , a friend recommended @entity1 tried plus - size modelling and she has n't looked back			1
now she 's in demand for editorial and commercial work and has launched her own swimwear range			0
she said that she does n't feel under pressure to diet to be part of the fashion industry so has no plans to lose her curves , like other plus - size models before her such as @entity63			1
@entity1 explained : ' i am the perfect shape for plus - size modelling			1
i do n't feel any pressure to lose weight as i 've been this size for years now and i do n't want to change or diet			2
i enjoy exercising and being able to eat foods i like			0
' body confident : @entity1 said she 's not going to diet and does n't covet a size 8 figure she added : ' it must annoy some of the other models when they see the plus - size models eating after they have starved themselves all night			1
' but she admitted being plus - size can be both a gift and a curse in the fashion world and a lot still needs to be done to make curvaceous girls more accepted and catered for			2
' being a plus - size model in an industry where there are n't many means there are some opportunities i would n't have had otherwise , ' she said			1
' but there are also less jobs available , particularly in mainstream and high - end fashion			0
' i know a lot of stunning girls who are not working because being a size 8 to 14 you are in @entity96 even though you have a normal , healthy body			1
' she added that she has had to work hard to prove herself as a model because of her size			2
' people are surprised when i turn up on a shoot and i can model			2
but why should n't i be able to do it just because i 'm a size 16 ? ' she said			1
while @entity1 has had worldwide success in magazines and campaigns , she has had little work on the catwalk and she blames this on designers ' reluctance to use models who are bigger than a size 8			1
role model : the @entity2 wishes there were more plus - size models like her she said : ' it 's disappointing as i love catwalk modelling , it 's more exciting than being on a shoot so it sucks not to be included			2
' plus - size models are being used more in magazines and in the media but not on the runway and not by high - end designers like @entity130			0
i 'd love them to use more curvy girls but it 's like a taboo and i do n't know why			0
it screams lack of diversity			0
' her own career ambitions aside , the model claims that the lack of larger catwalk models is also damaging for young girls			0
she said : ' it does n't send out a good message to teenager girls who are impressionable			0
they 're not coat hangers , they 're girls and it 's bad for them to only see skinny frames on the catwalk			0
i hope i can be a strong role model for them but there 's not enough of us plus - size models			2
' @entity1 's values sit well with @entity35 who also aim to celebrate diversity , which is reflected in their latest campaign showcasing their clients who include @entity166 actor @entity165 , former @entity169 contestants @entity167 and and another plus size model , @entity171			1
founder , @entity172 , a former model , describes @entity17 as a boutique agency that understands no two models are alike			0
she said : ' @entity17 has been instrumental in pushing the boundaries in terms of diversity , we believe that there is no longer a standard size for modelling and we look at everyone 's potential individually			0
it 's about offering something unique and special to clients			0
' @entity17 's roster has already seen their models like @entity1 grace covers from @entity190 @entity186 , star in campaigns from @entity193 to @entity194 and runway shows from @entity196 to @entity197			0
in 2013 they launched @entity199 headed up by @entity200 , who prior to joining the agency , helped guide the career of @entity204 for more than nine years			0
the # @entity206 campaign aims to show off the agency 's diversity of talent and features @entity167 and @entity210 the fashion dog for more information visit @entity213			1
