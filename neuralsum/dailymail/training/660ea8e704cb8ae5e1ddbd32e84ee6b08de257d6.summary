lawsuit : @entity8 , who was detained for 23 after a search of energy bars and a sports watch in his carry - on bag at @entity10 , has sued the @entity19 confusion : @entity19 workers initially thought that the power bar in @entity8 's bag along with a heart - monitoring watch were a possible explosive device @entity35 reports that the employees asked him what a tube shaped item in his bag was to which he replied his heart - monitoring watch			1
@entity8 claims that @entity19 staff then went on to ask him if he had any ‘ organic matter ’ in his bag meaning food			1
@entity8 who thought ‘ organic matter ’ meant just fruit and vegetables said no. power bars are considered organic matter because they are made with milk , grain , and sugar			2
they also vaguely resemble a common homemade explosive			0
@entity19 agents believed that the watch may have been the item used to detonate a bomb which they thought might be the @entity61			1
@entity8 said that airport staff later deemed his items harmless and that 's when he asked to file a complaint because the search took a long time and they failed to communicate with him effectively			2
