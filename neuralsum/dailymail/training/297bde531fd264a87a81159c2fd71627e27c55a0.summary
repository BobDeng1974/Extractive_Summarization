the @entity1 archbishop of @entity2 has unveiled a controversial document that instructs staff at @entity1 high schools to refrain from saying or doing anything publicly that contradicts church doctrine			1
archbishop @entity9 's new faculty handbook describes homosexuality , same - sex marriage , abortion , birth control , sex outside of marriage , the viewing of pornography and masturbation as ' evil			1
' the handbook additions would take effect in the 2015 - 16 school year at @entity22 and @entity23 in @entity2 , @entity24 in @entity25 , and @entity26 in @entity27			1
' the handbook clarifies that even though @entity55 allows same - sex marriages , holy matrimony can only take place between a man and a woman			1
@entity9 's document calls sperm donation , the use of a surrogate and other forms of ' artificial reproductive technology ' evil as well , the @entity59 reported			1
should the @entity67 ? should the @entity67 ? now share your opinion the archbishop stressed the handbook additions are meant to provide clarity for teachers and not to target any educators for dismissal			1
@entity9 said in a in a @entity77 video : ' the intention is certainly not to pry into the private lives of the teachers			1
' we certainly are n't going to do that			0
' people are entitled to their private lives , but teachers also have to respect the mission of the school in the way they live their public lives			2
' @entity90 of teachers president @entity91 , a social studies teacher at @entity24 , said union members were still digesting what @entity9 had to say			1
@entity96 leaders said in a statement : ' we are pleased that the document acknowledges that the teachers in our high school are not all the same , like many @entity1 around the world who struggle with their adherence to some of the teachings of the church			2
' however , there are still concerns with the proposed language and some key issues that the union and archbishop are hopeful that we will be able to work out			2
' the @entity113 @entity67 has exempted churches and religious schools from having to abide by federal anti-discrimination laws for employees in ' ministerial roles			0
' confusion about the @entity121 's stance is prevalent in areas of sexual morality and religious discipline			0
for this reason , the statements for inclusion in the faculty handbook focus on these two areas			2
this focus does not imply lesser importance to @entity1 teachings on social justice , which in fact are widely accepted and well interpreted in @entity1 educational institutions			0
the areas requiring clarification are in @entity1 teachings on sexual morality and religious practice			0
having clear statements especially about ' hot button issues ' related to faith and morals is important to teachers for two reasons			0
the first is that a forthright statement of the @entity121 's position on these issues helps teachers provide good perspectives to their students who often struggle in these areas			0
the second reason is that candid formulation of @entity121 doctrine protects those teachers who do n't agree with the statements			0
that sounds counterintuitive , but it is indeed the case			0
in a society in which confusion reigns about @entity121 teachings , highlighting the controversial issues alerts teachers to avoid contradicting @entity121 teaching on these issues either in the school or in some public way outside the classroom			0
@entity173 @entity172 have viewed @entity9 with suspicion even before he was installed as archbishop in october 2012			2
as the auxiliary bishop in @entity176 , he helped spearhead the passage in 2008 of a state constitutional amendment that had outlawed same - sex marriage in @entity55			1
since 2011 , he has chaired the @entity181 subcommittee that works to oppose same - sex marriage nationwide			1

archbishop @entity9 unveiled a new handbook that calls homosexuality , same - sex marriage , abortion and birth control ' evil '
activists say handbook goes against @entity43 ' message of inclusion
@entity195 would take effect at four @entity198 *catholic* schools in the fall
@entity9 says additions are not meant to target teachers for dismissal
