the @entity1 board has rejected @entity3 's £ 18million takeover bid after claiming it does not ' adequately value a controlling interest in the @entity5 '			1
it emerged on sunday night that the owner of the @entity9 's @entity8 wanted to buy a controlling stake in the crisis - hit @entity12 outfit			1
but the recent purchases of significant shareholdings by @entity16 and the @entity20 group - wealthy fans @entity17 , @entity21 and @entity22 - soon made any such move highly unlikely			1
@entity8 owner @entity3 has had his £ 18million takeover for @entity1 rejected @entity3 , 53 , had hoped to take a controlling stake in @entity1 but the board do not feel his offer was adequate and now the club 's directors - who are still looking for emergency cash , despite announcing a £ 500,000 loan from football board chairman @entity32 on monday - have confirmed they have knocked back @entity3 's offer			1
however , they have encouraged him to work with other supporters to help find a solution to @entity1 ' financial problems			0
in a 7am statement to the @entity40 , the board announced : ' the proposal by mr @entity3 comprises a placing of 100 million shares at 18p ( ' placing ' ) which , if approved by shareholders at a general meeting , would be immediately followed by an unconditional offer at 18p pursuant to rule 9 of the @entity48			1
the @entity49 would give mr @entity3 control of @entity1			2
' while the directors welcome mr @entity3 's approach , they believe that , notwithstanding the current financial difficulties , the proposal does not adequately value a controlling interest in the @entity5 and accordingly the resolution to approve the placing is unlikely to achieve the 75 % majority required			1
the directors do not intend to hold the general meeting which would be necessary to implement the proposal			0
@entity16 , seen here at the @entity60 vs @entity62 match , now holds a 14.57 per cent share in the club ' @entity5 is managing its cash resources carefully and will require further funding before the end of january			1
the directors are in discussions with @entity1 ' significant stakeholders with a view to arranging finance for the @entity73			0
this is likely to comprise loans in the short term and possibly equity in the medium term			0
the board has invited mr @entity3 to consider participating in a similar discussion alongside other supportive shareholders			1
' @entity3 made his offer just after @entity83 after being encouraged to take a look at the ailing @entity86 giants by former @entity12 defender @entity87 - now a successful youth football director in @entity89 , @entity90			1
however , his chances of success were soon reduced as @entity16 and the @entity20 bought up almost 34 per cent of the club in two surprise transactions			1
the board voted down its own resolution nine at last month 's agm to allow shares to be handed to new investors without first being offered to existing shareholders			2
that meant @entity3 's bid would require the support of 75 per cent of the club 's stakeholders			1
but while the club have rejected @entity3 's initial bid they will need someone to offer them help if they are to avoid a second administration event in three years			1
@entity17 and the @entity20 group have also purchased 13.3 million shares in the @entity12 club @entity117 owner @entity116 remains the key figure			1
while his 8.92 per cent stake is not as sizeable as the likes of @entity16 's , the £ 3million crisis loan he handed out late last year , combined with the retail deal he controls , puts him in a position of considerable strength			1
he has already placed @entity125 - his former @entity117 manager director - on the board as chief executive and made another move on monday as he handed the financial director 's job to associate @entity131			2
that could yet put him in trouble with the @entity134 - which has already charged him with breaching ' duel ownership ' rules and barred him from extending his shareholding to just under 30 per cent			0
@entity3 , though , insists he only ever had the best of intentions for the club			2
@entity116 owns @entity117 and also has a stake in @entity144 giants @entity1 in a separate @entity147 notice , the ceo of @entity147 - listed @entity146 outlined his hopes for @entity1 , saying : ' my three sons all play soccer for @entity154 's club			2
' initially , i 'd had some of my advisors examining potential investments in teams in the @entity159 and in @entity160 , but @entity154 encouraged me to take a close look at @entity1			0
' like all @entity1 fans , he 's really upset about how far the club has fallen in recent years and the more we spoke , the more interested i became			2
' i 'd be the first to admit that i 'm not a lifelong @entity1 supporter , but anyone who knows me is aware that i 'm a genuine sports fanatic and owning two major basketball franchises for the past decade has been an enormous privilege			0
' i 've spent the vast majority of my career in public companies and i 'm used to working in very highly regulated environments			0
i understand the crucial importance of business integrity and transparency			0
' @entity1 fans have every right to be wary about someone showing an interest in the club they love , especially given some of the events of recent years			2
@entity1 shareholder @entity185 has given the club a £ 500,000 loan to stop it being wound up ' first and foremost i believe what the club needs today is a very quick , major injection of capital to stabilise things and i can give the @entity1 supporters a categorical assurance that i have the resources and ability to get this club back to its elite level			1
' i 'm looking forward to building a consensus amongst supporters and prominent @entity1 - minded figures who have the long - term success of the club at heart			0
' i 've had detailed research carried out on @entity1 and i 'm convinced that we could take it back to the top of the @entity144 game on a stable and sustainable basis			0
' @entity87 added : ' i 've known @entity3 for several years			0
he has been very supportive of our local club and has a very good reputation in the @entity215			0
' when he said he was looking to invest in football in @entity217 , i told him right away that @entity1 could really be doing with someone with his track record			0
i explained how far the club has fallen , but that there was huge potential to rebuild it			0
' even though i 'm now based over here , i always watch really closely how things are going at @entity12 and it 's tragic to see how a club which was once a force in @entity217 has been brought so low			0
' i can tell every @entity1 fan in @entity144 and abroad , if @entity3 is successful in becoming part of the club , he 'll not rest until they are back on top again			2
