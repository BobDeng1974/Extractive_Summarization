mystery spin bowlers have bamboozled @entity2 batsmen for years but on thursday at @entity4 ’s the deception for once will be on the other hand when @entity6 will be forced to counter the unorthodox in this summer ’s @entity8			1
@entity9 will become the first @entity11 spinner with the doosra in his armoury to play test cricket when he faces the kings of the unconventional and attempts to fill the massive gap left by the retirement of @entity18			1
to add to the irony of @entity11 being the team with something outside of the ordinary in their ranks for this two - @entity25 series , it is a spinner who has long been their nemesis who provided @entity9 ’s inspiration			1
mystery man : @entity9 has been working on his doosra , the off - spinner 's delivery that goes the other way man in form : @entity9 is set to make his test debut on thursday having impressed in the shorter forms @entity38 has been both successful and controversial in equal measure against an @entity11 team traditionally suspicious of what can be viewed as a dark art , but he may have done them a huge favour in mentoring @entity9 , 26 , at @entity45			1
‘ i ’ll be ready , ’ said @entity9 at @entity46 on tuesday , as he prepared to become one of three @entity48 in the @entity11 team , along with opener @entity50 , 24 , and all - rounder @entity52 , 25			1
‘ i know what i need to do as a spinner and i ’m sure i can do a good job			0
’ @entity18 ’s job has been handed , for now at least , to a man who is principally a stylish middle - order batsman but who is adamant he can become a good enough spinner to dispel @entity11 ’s specialist slow - bowling concerns			1
‘ i ’m not here to try to replace him , ’ said @entity9 of stepping into @entity18 ’s shoes			1
‘ i ’m here to do exactly what i ’ve been doing at @entity66			0
i ’m a batsman who bowls , at the moment , but i ’m more than a part - time bowler and i have the potential to be a top spinner			1
’ he will try to do it , almost uniquely among @entity77 , by employing the doosra , the off - spinner ’s delivery which turns away from the right - hander but which has always raised questions about its legitimacy			2
dual role : @entity9 says he sees himself primarily as a batsman but can develop into a top quality spinner swing bowling all - rounder @entity82 , who tore through @entity11 in the semi-final of the first @entity84 in 1975 , has died at 62			1
he battled health problems for years and complications escalated after a recent fall			0
the left - armer took six for 14 against @entity11 in the 1975 @entity84 semi-final at @entity90			1
@entity82 ( right ) had a liver transplant in 2005 when former captain @entity92 and some old team - mates raised money for the surgery			0
‘ he was at the front of the queue when they were handing out talent , but unfortunately he was right at the back of the queue when they handed out health and good luck , ’ said @entity92 yesterday			0
former australia test cricketer and popular broadcaster @entity105 said in a tweet : ‘ @entity108 has passed away ... a sad day ... had not an enemy in the game			0
’ @entity9 told @entity111 last month that he was prepared to bowl the wrong ’ un this season after working on it at @entity115 with @entity38 , and now he is ready to unleash it on @entity6 after a successful experiment in county cricket			1
the visitors , meanwhile , will rely on orthodox slow - left armer @entity120			0
‘ it ’s coming on well and if i have a couple of good days of practice i ’ll be ready to bowl it in this match , ’ said @entity9 , who estimates he has bowled eight doosras in @entity124 cricket this season and five or six in each @entity127 game			2
but with @entity6 ’s @entity133 being the latest mystery bowler to be reported for having a suspect action , during the fourth one - day international at @entity4 ’s only last month , is @entity9 confident it is legal ? ‘ the umpires have told me so far they ca n’t see the difference , so that ’s a positive , ’ said @entity9			1
‘ a lot of people have said they think it ’s pretty sound and i can bowl it			0
i ca n’t wait to get my first wicket with it			0
@entity38 told me once you get one or two wickets with it , you start bowling it a lot more			2
’ he is quick to praise @entity45 ’s overseas player			2
doosra danger : @entity133 ( left ) has had his action questioned but @entity9 is confident in his own doosra @entity18 song : @entity9 insists he is not going to replace @entity18 but can offer something different ‘ @entity38 has helped me loads , ’ said @entity9			1
‘ he ’s pushed me and given me a lot of confidence because it does take a bit of time to master it			0
you ca n’t beat the training i do with him			0
’ clearly not everyone in the @entity11 camp agrees			2
only last month , @entity167 appeared to question @entity38 ’s action on @entity169 , forcing the @entity170 to remind him of his social media responsibilities			2
did @entity38 have any message for @entity167 ? ‘ no , he was just a little bit upset , ’ admitted @entity9			1
‘ i have n’t spoken to @entity167 about it			0
it ’s none of my business			0
i just let them carry on			0
’ the wider significance of @entity9 ’s debut , as he explained to @entity111 last month , is his determination to be a positive role model for young @entity182 who , like him , grew up in inner - city areas with potential problems such as @entity185			1
the beard he wears proudly as a sign of his @entity189 faith — ‘ the beard that is feared ’ as a @entity45 marketing slogan has it — should be an inspirational symbol for @entity191 as he walks down the famous pavilion steps at @entity46			2
young guns : @entity52 ( left ) and @entity50 ( right ) could both be in line to make their debuts this week ‘ the beard is a label for us to show we are @entity182 , just as you would wear a school uniform , ’ said @entity9 , whose famous cricketing family will all be in attendance at @entity46			1
‘ it represents being on your best behaviour all the time			0
it means a lot to me and to other people too			0
‘ in terms of trying to inspire other people with faith to play cricket , i am very proud of that			0
’ he is a significant as well as highly promising @entity11 cricketer .			2

@entity11 face @entity6 in first test on thursday

@entity45 man *grateful* for @entity38 's influence , but does *n't* see himself as replacement for @entity18
