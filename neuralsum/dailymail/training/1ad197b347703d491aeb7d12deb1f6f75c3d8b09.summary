for some , the idea of cutting @entity2 's ties with @entity3 is a way of returning the country to a simpler and more independent time			1
however , according new research , the @entity8 relationship with @entity3 dates back far further than was previously thought			1
scientists have discovered that stone - age hunter gatherers in @entity12 were trading with continental wheat farmers 8,000 years ago - long before agriculture came to @entity2			1
researchers from the @entity16 were able to isolate dna from sediment core samples taken by divers from the sea floor below the cliffs on the north coast of the @entity23 , as shown in the picture above they have found dna for einkorn wheat buried within coastal sediments around the @entity23 off the south coast of @entity12			1
a study of ancient human bones has revealed how @entity30 had difficulties digesting milk around 5,000 years after the introduction of farming			2
it took at least that long for their genes to evolve until they were no longer intolerant to lactose , the natural sugar in mammalian milk , scientists suggests			2
researchers looked at ancient dna extracted from 13 individuals buried at archaeological sites in the @entity45 - a region known to have been at the crossroads of cultural change in @entity49 prehistory			2
the scientists also found changes in prehistoric technology , such as the adoption of farming , were linked with a significant influx of new people			2
for instance , in the @entity57 or @entity57 , ancient central @entity30 had an appearance closer to @entity60			0
in the @entity62 , there is another shift , with people coming into @entity3 from the @entity65 , such as the @entity66 or @entity67			0
researchers claim that tolerance to lactose only appeared in the @entity71 , around 4,000 years after these people began dairying			0
before then , most humans were lactose intolerant , and only later evolved the ability to break down this sugar in animal milk			0
however agriculture is not known to haarrived in @entity2 until around 6,000 years ago and scientists have found no evidence of wheat cultivation or pollen in the sediments			1
instead they believe local hunter - gatherers bought the wheat by trading with @entity49 farmers from as far away as the south of @entity88 or the @entity89			1
this means that even 8,000 years ago there must have been trade routes winding their way across the @entity49 continent to @entity2 across an ancient land bridge			2
the scientists say that the discovery shows that @entity2 was no - where near as isolated or insular as had been originally thought			1
they say the findings may also force a complete rethink about how agriculture first arrived in @entity2			2
dr @entity101 , a plant geneticist at the @entity16 who led the research , said : ' eight thousand years ago the people of mainland @entity2 were leading a hunter - gatherer existence , whilst at the same time in southern @entity49 farming was gradually spreading across @entity3			1
' @entity107 , einkorn is not found elsewhere in @entity2 until 2,000 years after the samples found at @entity109			1
' for the einkorn to have reached this site there needs to have been contact between @entity114 and @entity57 farmers far across @entity3			0
' the land bridges provide a plausible facilitation of this contact			0
' as such , far from being insular , @entity2 was culturally and possibly physically connected to @entity3			0
' the researchers suggest the wheat was brought to @entity2 by neolithic traders from southern @entity3 einkorn wheat , like that pictured above , is thought to be one of the first plants to have been domesticated the researchers , whose findings are published in the journal @entity127 , used new dna extraction and analysis techniques to extract @entity129 from underwater sediments			1
they obtained sediment cores from @entity109 on the north coast of the @entity23 , an area that had once been dry land before the end of the last ice age			1
using the ancient sedimentary dna , or @entity138 , the scientists were able to reconstruct a picture of the plants and animals left behind there by the mesolithic people who inhabited the area			0
among the native plants they found dna sequences that matched those of near eastern strains of wheat			2
professor @entity149 , chair of landscape archaeology at the @entity151 who was also involved in the study , said : ' we do n't think it was grown here			0
we think it was traded across @entity3			0
' what that tells us is that these societies were n't isolated and they were n't simple			0
the scientists developed a new technique to extract dna preserved in underwater sediments like above ' @entity164 , of course , is a signature for farming but this is 2,000 years before the onset of framing in @entity2 , and at this time the nearest farmers were either in the south of @entity88 or possibly as far away as the @entity89 , thousands of miles across continental @entity3			1
' this tells us rather than the traditional model of farming arriving with colonists or some sort of invasion , the ideas and concepts of farming must have arrived several thousand years earlier			0
' dr @entity178 , a palaeogeneticist at the @entity179 who was not involved in the study , said the technology used to extract dna in the study could revolutionise our understanding of history			0
he said : ' the ability to sequence @entity129 no longer associated with the macroscopic remains from which it originated presents a range of possibilities that begins with a refinement of accepted chronologies			0
' the unexpectedly early appearance of wheat in @entity2 should force a rethinking of both the strength of the relationships between early farmers and hunter - gatherers , and the origins of settled agricultural communities in @entity3			1

archaeologists found wheat dna in sediment off coast of the @entity23
the wheat dates from a time 2,000 years before farming started in the @entity8
scientists say the nearest farmers were in the south of @entity88 and @entity89
the discovery suggests the wheat grains were brought to @entity2 by traders
stone - age hunter - gatherers in @entity2 may learned about farming from them
historians say it could *transform* our understanding of stone - age culture
they say it shows @entity2 was not as isolated as once believed
