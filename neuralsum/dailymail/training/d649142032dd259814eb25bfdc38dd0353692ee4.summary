this is the haunting sight of a ' car graveyard ' nestled in a @entity3 forest , where vintage motors sit rusting among the fronds			0
the old - fashioned vehicles are thought to have been left in the wood near the village of @entity9 by @entity11 soldiers who were stationed in southern @entity12 during @entity13 when the war ended , military troops were sent home , but could not afford to ship the cars they had bought and hid them in the forest			1
since then , other cars have been added to the cemetery , many by soldiers stationed in the area after the war			1
the motors were driven up a hill and parked in a quiet spot , hidden from the outside world			0
once back in the @entity11 , soldiers who wanted their cars back were told they would have to take personal responsibility for the cost of shipping			2
not a single car was retrieved			0
over time , corrosion and decay have worn down the vehicles and what little remained was stolen by locals and car collectors , with dashboards and logos proving particularly popular for fixing similar old models			0
stay tuned : it was too expensive for the @entity11 army to ship the cars over to @entity11 , but they had hoped to recover them later priced out : after returning home , the soldiers were told they would have to take personal responsibility for the costs of shipping their cars out - and none did last one left : at one point there were four car graveyards around @entity9 , and as many as 500 vehicles tales to tell : @entity53 was used as a base in both @entity133 and for post-war operations neatly parked : the other graveyards in the area are thought to have contained cars roughly dumped together by soldiers in the 1950s and 1960s heroes : @entity11 troops drive through a @entity3 town in 1944 after defending them from a @entity143 offensive at one point there were four car graveyards around @entity9 , and as many as 500 vehicles , but only one ' plot ' - @entity147 - remains today			1
it contains around 100 - 150 vehicles , and some of the oldest models , although it has been added to by soldiers stationed in the village in later years			1
the latest other cemetery on record sounds very different - it was relatively small and linked to several back gardens , with the cars dumped roughly together			0
the smashed motors were all from the sixties to the eighties , manufactured in @entity160 and the @entity11 another contained cars made only in the fifties and sixties , left there by soldiers at a nearby @entity168 base , perhaps following post war assignments			2
@entity53 is one of the oldest villages in @entity12 - and it is hoped that the beautiful car graveyard will be preserved for just as much time to come			0
blowing the doors off : the cars , which would have been used to run errands and transport soldiers from place to place , have been ravaged by time rather than guns old - timers : there are other car graveyards all around the world , from @entity185 to @entity186 to an underwater cemetery in @entity188 , @entity189 streaked with tears : the cars act almost as a memorial for what took place in @entity12 and across @entity160 new and old : cars kept being brought to the same graveyards by @entity197 after their post-war tour was over eerie and enchanting : the spot is hugely popular with photographers and ' @entity202 ' splashes of colour : the forest is famous for its exceptional beauty action stations : the spot could make a perfect film set - as has happened at other car graveyards modern history : around 100 to 150 cars in various stages of decomposition stand in the spot different style : the @entity11 brought great change to the war after arriving in 1918			1

they had been stationed in the southern @entity12 village of @entity9
shipping cars home was too expensive for the soldiers
they hoped to collect them later , but none were ever retrieved
the vehicles have now corroded and parts have been taken by collectors
motors from soldiers based near the site at other times were added to the plot over the years
