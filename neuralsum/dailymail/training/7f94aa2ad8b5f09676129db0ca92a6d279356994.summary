by @entity1 reporter published : 08:21 est , 15 january 2013 updated : 13:57 est , 2 april 2013 @entity5 underneath the brazen diver 's hand , it looks as if this shark is enjoying itself so much it has even cracked a smile			0
luckily for diver @entity10 , the group of deadly tiger sharks has become so accustomed to his presence that they treat him as a plaything , rather than a snack			1
the 41 - year - old has learned how to coax the animals - one of the most dangerous shark species - into rolling over under his touch			2
@entity19 's grin : @entity10 , 41 , interacts with one of the sharks at @entity22 in the @entity23 where he visits several times a year after building up a relationship with the animals at @entity22 in the @entity23 , the animals now get so close to the diver that he can even rub his face against theirs			1
the diver , from @entity31 in @entity32 , @entity33 , travels to the beach several times a year , having done so for a decade			1
he always performs the same routine with the animals during the visits			2
amazingly , mr @entity10 said he can now identify individual sharks and says that they are also accustomed to his interaction			1
but despite the amazing level of trust he employs to engage with the sharks , the diver says he never forgets what they are capable of and why they have a reputation as being one of the top predators in the world			2
he said : ' they are wild animals so you can never get 100 % comfortable - they are deserving of the respect the other divers and i show them			0
risky kiss : mr @entity10 has developed a routine during which the sharks roll under his touch after visiting the same diving location over ten years friends : the diver says that he can now identify individual sharks , having given them names like @entity65 and @entity66 ' i 've been going to the same spot for the last 10 years and after a few repeat interactions they know the drill but i must not forget what they 're capable of			1
' " we 're usually surrounded by two to four tiger sharks plus around 40 lemon sharks and close to 60 reef sharks - they 're a bit smaller and more feisty but you have to respect them all the same			2
he added : ' you can spot which one is which by their different markings			0
they have various scratches and scars so you see them all the time			0
' he has named his favourite shark hook , who he describes as ' one of my darlings ' , and says that another shark called @entity66 is often attracted to him			0
he added : ' i 'm able to get them to roll 180 degrees in the palm of my hand			0
' they are really calm creatures unless they feel threatened so it 's important none of us did anything to alarm them - they know we are not in the water to harm them			0
' intimate : despite often getting close to the animals the diver says he still treats the animals with respect , saying he can ' never be 100 per cent comfortable ' swarmed : the diver and other members of his group are surrounded by tiger sharks and lemon sharks			1
