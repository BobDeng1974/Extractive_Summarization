get back : the two polar bears clashed over territory in the @entity6 in @entity7 keep your distance : the bears used their paws to jab at one another and push each other over standing tall : one of the bears adopts a lower position in the hope of knocking the other off its feet @entity29 wildlife photographer @entity28 could n't believe his eyes when the fight erupted in front of him			1
he then spent the next ten minutes watching the two half - a - ton beasts crash into one another as the sun 's rays reflected off their fur			0
mr @entity28 said : ' i could n't believe my eyes because it was such a strange sight as the sun light on the bear 's fur made it look like they were red with anger towards each other			2
snow fight : flecks of snow fly in the air as the bears switch from a sitting to a fighting stance i 'll bite you : the beasts bear their teeth at each other and appear to look for flesh to bite into down for the count : one of the bears puts its weight on the other which had fallen over during the fracus ' a lot of the time capturing shots like this is a matter of being in the right place at the right time and luckily for me i was there with my camera ready to shoot			0
' it 's quite surreal to see the pictures now because the reddish lighting makes them look particularly arty			0
' they are incredibly strong animals , i do n't think the rival had it in him to finish the fight and eventually wandered off			2
