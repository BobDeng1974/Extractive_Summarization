the atmosphere on @entity2 was once thicker , warmer and wetter than it is today until it was damaged in a ' catastrophic collision ' with a planet the size of @entity6 , scientists claim			1
data collected by @entity9 's curiosity rover suggests the @entity2 's atmosphere once had more oxygen in it than @entity12 , giving serious weight to the theory it could have previously harboured alien life			1
yet a major upheaval , thought to have been caused when a @entity6 - sized planet collided into @entity2 billions of years ago , created a shift in gases that led to the atmosphere around it to shrink			1
measurements of the @entity2 air by the rover found it is mostly made of carbon dioxide with traces of other gases theory : there was interest in what may have existed in the past on @entity2 , after @entity26 found that much of the planet 's atmosphere has been lost over time , suggesting it was once warmer a team of @entity9 scientists claim that a change in the ratio of two different kinds of argon gas is evidence that the atmosphere has been stripped away			1
@entity9 's dr @entity50 said : ' as @entity2 became a planet and its magma ocean solidified , catastrophic outgassing occurred while volatiles were delivered by impact of comets and other smaller bodies			1
' solar wind , and the possible impact by a @entity6 - sized body is thought to have stripped much of the initial early atmosphere from the planet , and since then the atmosphere has developed as a balance between volcanic injection and loss to space			1
' the @entity9 scientists were investigating the atmosphere after one of their telescopes on @entity12 had detected a surprising and mysterious amount of methane in three regions in the @entity2 western hemisphere			1
this presence of methane could have suggested there was some form of life living on the planet			2
yet the @entity26 did not find any methane , which has disappointed those who believe microbes may still linger there			0
on @entity12 , methane is mainly a by - product of life - from animal digestion and decaying plants - and the gas can also be produced by non-biological processes			2
disappointment : last year , the curiosity team reported no definitive whiff of methane near the landing site , and since then , the rover has taken several more air samples red planet : a view of @entity2 that was stitched together by images taken by @entity26 's @entity98 spacecraft but last year , the curiosity team reported no definitive whiff of methane near the landing site , and since then , the rover has taken several more air samples			1
there are also plans to sniff the atmosphere during a drive to the @entity110 mountain			0
and in the autumn @entity26 is set to launch a @entity2 - orbiting spacecraft aimed at solving the methane mystery			2
called @entity114 , the craft will target the @entity2 atmosphere			0
scientists want to know if it actually exists , determine the abundance and whether that varies by year or location			0
' the fact that it ’s turned out to be pretty much disproven - it ’s not a surprise , but a disappointment perhaps , ' planetary scientist @entity124 of the @entity125 in @entity126 , told @entity127			0
' the fact that ( life today ) has turned out to be pretty much disproven - it ’s not a surprise , but a disappointment perhaps ' @entity124 , planetary scientist the @entity26 found the air is made mostly of carbon dioxide			2
this closely matched what the twin @entity98 landers detected in the late 1970s and what scientists have gleaned from @entity2 meteorites			0
and there was also interest in what may have existed in the past on @entity2 , after @entity26 found that much of the planet ’s atmosphere has been lost over time , suggesting it was once warmer			2
this would have been more conducive to liquid water flowing on the surface - and potentially even life existing on the planet , reported @entity127			0
@entity2 ' atmosphere is overwhelmingly dominated by carbon dioxide , unlike @entity12 's air , which is a mix of nitrogen and oxygen			1
however , there was still a small surprise			0
results : the nuclear - powered , six - wheel rover set down in an ancient crater near the @entity2 equator almost a year ago @entity98 found nitrogen to be the second most abundant gas in the @entity2 air , but @entity26 's measurements revealed a nearly equal abundance of nitrogen and argon , a stable noble gas			1
mission scientists are puzzled , but suspect it might have to do with the different tools used to sample the atmosphere			0
‘ it 's more or less an interesting observation ’ but does n't change the notion that @entity2 lost most of its original atmosphere to space , transforming the planet into a cold desert , said @entity176 of @entity26 's @entity177 , who is in charge of @entity26 's air sampling experiments			2
the nuclear - powered , six - wheel rover set down in an ancient crater near the @entity2 equator almost a year ago			0
the measurements were detailed in two studies appearing in the journal @entity191 .			0

curiosity rover found @entity2 's atmosphere was once thicker and wetter
it is believed to have contained oxygen long before @entity12 's atmosphere did
yet no methane was found , which would have suggested life 's still there
@entity9 scientists now believe a collision with a @entity6 - sized planet caused the air to shrink
