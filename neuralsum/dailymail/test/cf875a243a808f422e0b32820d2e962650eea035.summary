' she fell about 200ft but the cliff was on a slight slope			0
i could n't see her at the bottom but my daughter did so we knew she survived the drop			2
' the coastguard winched one of them over the cliff and he went from side to side looking for her but could n't see her			2
' it 's rocky there , there 's thick patches of gorse and it 's extremely dangerous			0
' after a couple of hours they said they just could n't spot her			0
they were very upset about it			0
