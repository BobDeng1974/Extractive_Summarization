' have you seen @entity11 in the morning ? it ’s like the mother * * * * * ’ @entity14 , ' he ranted while addressing the a @entity16 audience			2
@entity3 's appearance on @entity18 insisting his birthplace has greatly changed may not have been necessary as @entity21 photos reveal @entity11 really does have an awful lot of dogs			1

he wanted to clarify some of the ideas he expressed , but did he have a point ? the row began a long - winded rant against gentrification in the @entity31 art school on tuesday night when he was asked to argue against the development of poorer neighborhoods in @entity31 and @entity47			1
