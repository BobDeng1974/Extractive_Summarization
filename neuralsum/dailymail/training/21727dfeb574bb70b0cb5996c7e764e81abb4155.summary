by @entity0 published : 08:57 est , 10 january 2013 updated : 09:03 est , 10 january 2013 a sample of a two - year - old boy 's hair showed traces of cocaine , heroin and methadone , likely to have been ingested by the toddler in the last four months of his life , a court has heard			1
the tests were done on a sample of @entity14 's hair after he died from allegedly drinking his mother 's methadone			1
his parents @entity19 , 33 , and @entity20 , 45 , from @entity21 , @entity22 , both deny the manslaughter of their son as well as cruelty to a person under 16			2
a sample of hair belonging to @entity14 who died in hospital last march after drinking methadone from a child 's beaker showed traces of cocaine , methadone , and heroin , @entity27 heard a tribute to @entity14 , 2 , who died soon after paramedics were called to the flat he lived in with his parents @entity19 , 33 , and @entity20 , 45 , from @entity21 , @entity22 consultant forensic toxicologist @entity40 told the trial at @entity27 that quantities of heroin , methadone and cocaine were found in a hair sample that represented a minimum of the last four months of the child 's life			1
she said the amounts revealed by the tests indicated the drugs had been through the boy 's body rather than deposited on his hair			1
she said she could not say by what means the drugs had got into the child 's body			1
@entity60 , for @entity19 , proposed that @entity14 had ingested the drugs by putting contaminated items in his mouth , as well as through close contact with his mother			2
mr @entity60 said : ' @entity19 was in the habit of smoking her crack cocaine and heroin in her kitchen , with the door and window closed			2
' mrs @entity40 accepted that residue from the drugs would have landed on surfaces , including cupboard handles and crockery , as well as on @entity19			0
parents : @entity20 ( left ) and @entity19 ( right ) outside @entity27 , where the pair denied the manslaughter of two - year - old @entity14 and cruelty to a person under the age of 16 she said the mechanism described by mr @entity60 could give ' measurable amounts ' in the hair but , in her opinion , not the levels that were detected in @entity14 's case			1
she said : ' theoretically , that is possible			0
it would require a high degree of contamination of the home environment			0
' she said that the residue could have been removed by washing the surface			0
she also told the court that the amounts of drugs ingested , indicated by the levels of the substances in his hair , would have been ' capable of causing a reaction within the body '			2
mrs @entity40 said that the cocaine , a stimulant , could have caused the boy 's heart rate to increase , as well as cause vomiting and diarrhoea , whereas the heroin and methadone were depressants and could have slowed the toddler 's heart and breathing rates			1
previously , the jury was told that @entity19 was on a methadone treatment programme			0
it is alleged that @entity14 drank some methadone that @entity19 had poured into a child 's beaker , intended for her own use , and put on top of a chest of drawers			1
opening her prosecution case , @entity128 told a jury at @entity27 that @entity19 , who repeatedly dabbed her eyes with a tissue in the dock , was struggling to get over a heroin habit			0
@entity14 , 2 , died soon after paramedics were called to the flat above a disused shop @entity19 has a history of drug use going back many years and is being prescribed methadone to try to rid her of the habit , ms @entity138 told the court			1
a child 's beaker with methadone was left on a set of drawers in his parents ’ bedroom where he also slept , so it would be ‘ within easy reach ’ of his mother , ms @entity138 alleged			1
@entity19 awoke to find @entity14 unconscious in bed next to her and called 999 on march 13 last year			2
she described her son to police as ‘ a gorgeous little boy ’ and a ‘ loveable rogue who got up to the usual mischief ’ , the court heard			0
‘ not only would ( the beaker ) have attracted him to it like a little bee to a honeypot but it was also within easy reach of him , ’ she said			0
it was ‘ grave negligence ’ by his parents to leave the dangerous drug in a beaker , which the toddler would have thought was juice , the prosecutor told the court			0
paramedics arrived to find @entity14 lifeless			0
his heart had stopped beating and his lips were blue , ms @entity138 told the court			0
the toddler was taken to hospital but pronounced dead shortly after arriving			0
friends and family of the couple wept in the dock as ms @entity138 told the jury that post-mortem tests showed that @entity14 had enough methadone in his blood , stomach and urine to prove fatal			1
sadness : mourners leave flowers outside a disused shop below the flat where @entity14 died last march he is believed to have consumed between 10ml and 20ml of methadone , the court heard			1
the couple originally told officers that @entity14 must have climbed on top of a wardrobe in the bedroom where the methadone was usually stored in a locked wooden box , ms @entity138 told the court			2
she claims that @entity20 , who was watching television in the other room on the morning of the incident , let @entity14 go back into the bedroom unsupervised , knowing that methadone was within his reach and knowing that @entity19 was sleeping off drugs she had taken the night before			2
