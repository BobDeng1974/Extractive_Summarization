@entity0 was on holiday in @entity2 when word finally arrived that after keeping her hanging on for most of this year , @entity5 bosses had decided she would n't be part of the next series of @entity9 's popular spin - off show the @entity10			1
she promptly went out and got raging drunk			1
she 's not the type to moan about how difficult things are			1
she prefers to say things are ' challenging '			1
they certainly can be when you work for @entity17 , whether you 're a rags - to - riches talent show winner , a highly paid judge or a presenter			1
taken its toll : @entity0 says that therapy was helpful in changing the way she thinks as she is a self - confessed worrier @entity0 's been the successful host of @entity25 since 2011 , and while the main show 's ratings plummeted during that time , her chemistry with co-host @entity27 made sure the @entity10 's went up			1
but the world and his wife had been auditioning for the role as she stood by smiling			1
now – even more cutting – her job has been given to @entity35 dj @entity36			1
as @entity17 would probably say – with the inevitable shrug – ' that 's showbiz '			1
the news of her departure was broken by @entity0 herself on @entity42			1
@entity0 was met with a flood of online abuse when she started dating @entity45 who was 14 years her junior ' after three brilliant years of hosting the @entity10 it 's time to pass the baton			1
it 's been incredible and i 'll never forget it , ' she said			1
today she 's stoical about the cut - throat nature of the business			1
' with this industry you have to learn to cope with the ups and downs quite early on – you have to be prepared for what it 's like , ' she says			1
' it 's a competitive industry and there will always be other people who want to do your job			1
i very much know what the industry is like			1
it makes it fun and interesting			1
you do it because you love it			1
the ups are good and the downs can be challenging			1
' i do n't see it as being bad at all – it 's an exciting time			2
@entity17 keeps changing his shows on a regular basis , and change is healthy when it comes to television			2
even if you look back at his programmes from five years ago they look dated			2
he 's always discovering something new			2
' @entity0 , 34 , is putting on a brave face			1
she tells me she 's a born worrier , and if she prefers to see challenges rather than difficulties that 's because she endured a baptism of fire when she was first thrust into the limelight after she started dating @entity90 's @entity45 , who was 14 years her junior , shortly after she started on the @entity10			1
the two met when she interviewed him on the show and he bombarded her with emails until she agreed to a date			2
they were in a relationship for three months			1
not everyone was happy about it , to put it mildly			2
she was branded a ' cradle - snatcher ' and inundated with hate mail , one magazine even showed its readers how to make a voodoo doll of her			2
' when the bullies first started it became a bit all - consuming and i got a bit lost in my thoughts , ' she recalls			2
but the more you learn about @entity42 the more you realise it 's an outlet for people to be angry			2
i was always comfortable in my own skin until people started criticising it			2
they 'd talk about my appearance and call me fat			2
at first i thought , " what have i done wrong ? " now i know there are a lot of angry people out there			2
you do n't get the ups without the downs , or the downs without the ups			2
brave face : @entity0 announced her dismissal from the @entity10 via @entity42 last week she first went for therapy many years earlier when her parents divorced , and found the techniques she learnt then helped her get over the online bullying			1
' for me , therapy was a way of changing the way you think , ' she says			2
' i do over-think things			0
i 've always been a worrier , ever since i was a child			0
my twin sister has always been the complete opposite and i think i worry more about her than she does about herself			0
her three children call me @entity146 when they 're with me ; i 'm over-protective			0
i 'm prepared for every eventuality			0
' @entity0 's a grafter who discovered quite young that if going in one direction does n't work , there can be another way around			1
growing up in rural @entity153 with her three siblings , she always knew she wanted to be on tv – she just was n't sure how			0
' i was a massive tv addict because i lived in a village where there was n't much going on – it was a sort of escapism , ' she says			0
' i was obsessed with @entity160 and @entity161 and wanted to live in their world			0
' knock back : one of @entity0 's best friends @entity35 dj @entity36 will replace her on the @entity10 she started appearing in local pantos and studied musical theatre in @entity167 before moving to @entity168 with the dream of treading the @entity171 boards			1
she never has ; she found work as an actress on the comedy sketch show @entity175 ! and was considered so funny she started getting work as a presenter			0
' things worked themselves out in a way i never expected , ' she says			0
' although there 's part of me , the little actress in there , that would still like a go doing musical theatre			0
' she 's now dating music manager @entity188 – a mere ten years her junior – who recently moved into her north @entity168 flat			0
' i would n't say i 'm completely settled down , ' she says , adding that some of her favourite times are when she 's completely alone with just the tv for company			0
she recently posed with a baby bump at a friend 's baby shower , but purses her lips when i ask whether she 's planning to have babies with @entity188			0
' that 's a difficult question			0
i do hope for a family one day but not right now			0
i hope i get to have children , though ; i think that 's the point of life			0
' she laughs at her reputation as a cougar – a woman who likes to go out with younger men			1
' i suppose if someone is going to force you into a category it 's a fun category to be in			0
no one really knows what 's going on in my private life , though			0
i could be known for something a lot worse			0
it 's not a bad way to live your life			0
' she 's just hosted a new comedy panel show @entity226 on @entity227 and presented the celebrity soccer aid match a couple of weeks ago which raised more than £ 5 million for @entity230			0
she 's also the face of communications company @entity231			1
she recently helped it celebrate signing up its millionth tv customer			0
she 's busy enough , she insists , and says she 's pleased with the way things are progressing			0
' i 'm living out my ambition			0
each job is as challenging as the last			0
my hope is just to keep on working and i 'm ambitious for a nice long career			0
i 'm looking forward to whatever it is i do next			0
' @entity0 is helping @entity231 say ' thanks a million ' to its 1 million tv customers .			1

@entity0 has become known as quite the cougar
she speaks of the ' horrible ' *backlash* over her relationship with @entity45
she puts on a brave face despite being axed from the @entity10 in favour of @entity35 dj
