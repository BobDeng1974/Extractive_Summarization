@entity2 's @entity1 spacecraft has captured stunning images of two of @entity6 's moons on its approach to the dwarf planet			1
@entity9 and @entity10 are visible in images taken from a distance of 115 million miles ( 186 million km ) , revealing the best - ever view of them			1
these are the first of a series of long - exposure images that will improve our understanding of the @entity6 system			1
scientists in @entity22 have revealed new images of the @entity6 system			1
in the images ( shown ) the tiny moons @entity9 ( highlighted in the orange diamond ) and @entity10 ( yellow ) can be seen orbiting			1
the bright and dark streak extending to the right of @entity6 is an artifact of the camera electronics , resulting from overexposure the moons are two of the five known to be orbiting @entity6 - the others being @entity36 , @entity37 and @entity38			2
in july this year @entity1 will become the first spacecraft ever to visit @entity6			1
it was launched on 19 january 2006 at a speed of 36,373 mph ( 58,536 km / h ) - the fastest spacecraft ever to leave @entity43 orbit , 100 times faster than a jetliner after passing the orbits of all the major planets from @entity43 to @entity47 , @entity1 is now beginning its final leg of its 3 billion - mile ( 4.8 billion km ) journey			2
on 14 july 2015 the flyby of @entity6 will begin			2
using a suite of instruments , the spacecraft will map the surface of @entity6 and its moon @entity36 to a resolution of 25 miles ( 40km ) - far better than anything possible before			2
this will reveal the surface features of @entity6 - which may include ice			0
as it flies past , it will also look back at the two bodies against the sun , to look for telltale signs of an atmosphere			0
despite the long journey , @entity1 will be travelling at such a speed that the flyby will last only around two hours - beginning at 11.49am gmt ( 06.49am est ) on 14 july and ending just after 2.15pm gmt ( 9.15am est )			1
after passing @entity6 , @entity1 will flyby one or several @entity70 ( kbos ) , other bodies beyond the orbit of @entity6			2
the mission will officially end in 2026			0
@entity36 is by far the largest , just over half the size of @entity6 , while the others are much , much smaller			0
@entity6 measures about 1,470 miles ( 2,370km ) across , whereas @entity9 and @entity10 are each between 25 to 95 miles ( 40 to 150km ) across - although their precise sizes wo n't be known until @entity1 gets closer			1
' it 's thrilling to watch the details of the @entity6 system emerge as we close the distance to the spacecraft 's july 14 encounter , ' said @entity1 science team member dr @entity84 , from the @entity85 in @entity86 , @entity22			1
' this first good view of @entity9 and @entity10 marks another major milestone , and a perfect way to celebrate the anniversary of @entity6 's discovery			2
' these images were taken almost exactly 85 years after the discovery of @entity6 by @entity95 astronomer @entity94 in 1930			2
in a tribute to the discoverer of the dwarf planet , and also the region at the edge of the solar system known as the @entity70 , some of his ashes are travelling on board the @entity1 spacecraft			1
' professor @entity94 's discovery of @entity6 was far ahead its time , heralding the discovery of the @entity70 and a new class of planet , ' said dr @entity112 , @entity1 principal investigator , also from the @entity85			2
' the new horizons team salutes his historic accomplishment			0
' the moons can be seen here orbiting @entity6			0
@entity10 ( in yellow ) , @entity6 's outermost known moon , orbits @entity6 every 38 days at a distance of approximately 40,200 miles ( 64,700 km ) , while @entity9 ( in orange ) orbits every 25 days at a distance of 30,260 miles ( 48,700 km ) in july this year @entity1 will become the first spacecraft ever to visit @entity122 ( illustration shown )			1
it was launched on 19 january 2006 at a speed of 36,373 mph ( 58,536 km / h ) - the fastest spacecraft ever to leave @entity43 orbit , 100 times faster than a jetliner @entity6 is an extremely distant world , orbiting the sun more than 29 times farther than @entity43			0
it is about two thirds the size of our moon			0
with a surface temperature estimated to be -229 ° @entity135 ) , the environment at @entity6 is far too cold to allow liquid water on its surface			0
@entity6 's moons are also in the same frigid environment			0
the moon @entity36 is almost half the size of @entity6			0
the moon is so big that @entity6 and @entity36 are sometimes referred to as a double dwarf planet system			1
the distance between them is 12,200 miles ( 19,640 km )			0
@entity36 's orbit around @entity6 takes 6.4 @entity43 days			0
@entity36 neither rises nor sets , but hovers over the same spot on @entity6 's surface			0
the same side of @entity36 always faces @entity6 - this is called tidal locking			0
compared with most of the planets and moons , the @entity6 - @entity36 system is tipped on its side			0
the discovery of these two moons fairly late , though , in june 2005 , has led some to worry that there may be other either smaller moons in orbit around @entity6 , which could pose a problem for @entity1 as it flies past the dwarf planet on 14 july			1
these latest images were assembled into a seven - frame movie , revealing the spacecraft 's first extended look at @entity10 and its first - ever view of @entity9			2
the images were made using the @entity169 ( @entity170 ) camera on @entity1 , but as they are so small and dark they were fairly hard to spot			0
@entity9 and @entity10 were discovered by @entity1 team members in @entity175 images taken in 2005			1
@entity10 , @entity6 's outermost known moon , orbits @entity6 every 38 days at a distance of approximately 40,200 miles ( 64,700 km ) , while @entity9 orbits every 25 days at a distance of 30,260 miles ( 48,700 km )			1
@entity6 's two other small moons , @entity37 and @entity38 , are still smaller and too faint to be seen by @entity1 at its current range to @entity6 ; they will become visible in the months to come			2
and on 14 july at 11.49am gmt ( 6.49am est ) , @entity1 will make its historic flyby of the @entity6 system - although owing to the large distances involved , we wo n't know for a few hours how successful the mission was as the signals make their way back to earth			1
this image , taken by @entity2 's @entity175 , shows five moons orbiting the distant , icy dwarf planet @entity6			1
@entity37 ( initially designated @entity37 ) , is the innermost of the moons found by @entity175 over the past seven years			0
this image was taken with @entity175 's @entity194 on 7 july 2012 @entity1 will pass within 6,200 miles ( 10,000km ) of @entity6 , revealing our best ever view of the dwarf planet and its surrounding system			1
in this illustration @entity6 is on the left , and its large moon @entity36 - which is half the size of @entity6 - is on the right			0

scientists in @entity22 have revealed new images of the @entity6 system
in the images the tiny moons @entity9 and @entity10 can be seen orbiting
they were taken by the @entity1 spacecraft on its approach
the spacecraft is now within 115 million miles of the dwarf planet
it will make its closest approach to @entity6 on 14 july this year after a journey lasting more than nine years
