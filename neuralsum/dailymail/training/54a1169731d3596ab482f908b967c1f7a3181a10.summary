' despite all odds , he survived ‘ i was saying goodbye to one baby and waiting for the next to be born and say goodbye , ’ said @entity0			1
that ’s not quite how it worked out			0
at a little over 23 weeks , doctors decided to do an emergency cesarean and deliver the remaining twin			0
at over three months premature , @entity15 weighed 507 grams and was ‘ about the size of a @entity22 baby			1

after doctors managed to keep her from delivering @entity15 she thought she was ' waiting for the next to be born and say goodbye ' serious : @entity15 was delivered by c - section at 23 weeks and rushed to a neonatal intensive care unit high tech : doctors at the @entity43 's state - of - the - art neonatal unit acted fast , giving @entity15 life - saving drugs to open his lungs and putting him on a ventilator getting better : after months on life support , @entity15 's health miraculously began to turn around ‘ they scooped him up and put him in an incubator and put a breathing tube down his throat , ’ @entity0 said of the moments after her son ’s birth			1
‘ after a few minutes the doctor came over and said , “ we got him -- he 's been resuscitated			0
” ’ his chances of survival were around 1 in 100 as he was rushed to the @entity66 ’s state - of - the - art neonatal intensive care unit			0
with the help of ventilators , drugs to help open the lungs , and a technology known as continuous positive air pressure , @entity15 held on			1
when things appeared to slowly improve for the baby , doctors told @entity0 and her husband , who is himself a physician , that they would likely be leaving the hospital with healthy baby			1
doubts : even @entity15 's father , himself a physician , found it hard to believe he was finally taking home his son survivor : the @entity85 were finally able to take @entity15 home after months of waiting growing up : now three years old , @entity15 ( here with his dad ) is developing normally , other than being a bit short for his age joyful : ' he can pretty much do what any 3 - year - old can do , ' says @entity5 but @entity0 ’s husband , who ’d done a rotation at the very same neonatal unit over a decade previously , did n’t believe it			1
' i could n't figure out why they were lying to me , ’ he told his wife at the time			0
after two months on life support , however , the doctors were proven correct			0
the @entity85 took @entity15 home			2
now three years old , he continues to defy the odds			2
not just surviving , @entity15 is thriving and shows no abnormalities other than being short for his age			2
