last night it was unclear how much money mr @entity1 , who resigned from @entity35 over the notorious ‘ @entity37 ’ incident , will be told to pay			1
but the debt could not come at a worse time for the @entity41 mp , who is involved in two potentially expensive libel actions			1
the politician is suing @entity45 newspaper over its original report about his row with a diplomatic protection officer called @entity49 , whom he allegedly called a ‘ * * * * ing pleb ’ at the gates of @entity53			0
mr @entity1 denies he used the word ‘ pleb ’			1
@entity56 is , in turn , suing mr @entity1 over comments he made about him at a televised press conference last year			1
however there is mounting speculation that mr @entity49 ’s legal proceedings against mr @entity1 could be dropped , following negotiations involving the @entity65			2
mr @entity1 ’s case against @entity45 remains scheduled for the @entity67 in december			2
according to @entity31 , mr @entity1 – a former investment banker whose wealth was estimated to be £ 2.2million in 2012 – invested in @entity69 2 in the 2000s			2

the 2006 ' semi-comedic romp ' was savaged by critics this week , @entity77 listed @entity69 2 as one of 1,200 candidates for ‘ accelerated payment notices ’			1
this is a power that takes effect this week meaning that investors can be asked to repay all tax that @entity77 thinks they should have paid before going to court			2
other well - known figures who invested in @entity69 2 include @entity96 ( now @entity98 ) @entity97 , the former chief secretary to the treasury , and @entity100 , former chairman of the @entity32			0
all insist they invested in the scheme to support the film industry			2
@entity69 said : ‘ @entity77 has failed to distinguish between commercial businesses and tax avoidance schemes and have , without proper consideration , deemed all film arrangements to be tax schemes			1
’ as a minimum , investors in @entity110 could put in £ 36,000			2
if they put in that much , @entity69 would then loan them a further £ 64,000 to invest , taking their stake up to £ 100,000			0
that would be used to buy shares in film productions which , in their first year , created a £ 90,000 loss			0
according to @entity31 , top - rate taxpayers who invested in the scheme could choose to write off that loss against their taxes			0
this meant that in return for putting in £ 36,000 in cash , they would get about the same amount in tax relief very fast – and end up owning a £ 100,000 stake in a group of films			0
if it is challenged and @entity77 wins a subsequent case , the revenue can keep the money			0
if it loses , it must refund the cost of the process			0
mr @entity1 said : ‘ when the last @entity35 introduced tax incentives to invest in the @entity76 film industry , along with many other investors , i did so through @entity138			1
i resigned from @entity69 when i was in @entity35 and always pay all tax when due			0
’ @entity140 said : ‘ the @entity35 at the time promoted a policy to stimulate investment in the @entity76 film industry through tax incentives			0
the @entity145 gave effect to this policy			0
’ lord @entity148 said : ‘ it was presented as a genuine film investment partnership			0
it never occurred to me it was tax avoidance			1
‘ if the revenue contact me , then i would pay it back			0
