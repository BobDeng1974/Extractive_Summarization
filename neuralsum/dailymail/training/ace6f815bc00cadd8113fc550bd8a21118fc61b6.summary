if you are looking for that perfect @entity6 present then one of these could be just the ticket - if you want to make your other half run for the hills , that is			0
these gruesome teddy bears , called the ' @entity9 ' , have been selling like hot cakes in the run up to february 14th			0
so many people have placed orders for a £ 59 @entity6 teddy ripping its bleeding heart out that their @entity17 creator , artist @entity16 , says he has sold out			1
do n't worry , he 's armless : spooky teds look like they have been mauled by zombies romantic ? this £ 59 @entity22 's model featuring a bear that has ripped its heart out of its chest has sold out mr @entity16 , who lives with his fiancée and two - year - old son in the @entity29 countryside , describes his gory creations as ' repurposed soft toys transformed into fluffy , bloody horrors to keep you awake at night '			1
the 45 - year - old makes the zombie teddy bears by transforming old toys using film - standard special effects make - up			2
he said : ' i hit on the idea of making zombie teddy - bears - the inspiration came from a rather obscure in - joke between my partner and i. ' zombified to order ' : @entity16 also makes bespoke teddies , customising clients ' bears as they wish some bears have worse injuries than others - these two appear to have suffered particularly badly ' she had a terrible cold at the time and we 'd been talking about a gift for a friend 's baby			1
with a very stuffy nose " teddy - bear " kept coming out as " deady - bear " , and we joked about zombie teddies that creep from under your bed at night to feast on your brains while you sleep			2
' mr @entity16 initially tried sewing bones and organs out of felt , but felt his sewing skills were n't up to it			1
having long been a fan of film director @entity73 , creator of zombie film @entity74 , and with training in theatrical and special effects make - up , he decided to use the same techniques on teddies			0
he bought some old bears on @entity82 , but when his partner became pregnant and they moved house , the artist forgot all about the teddy bears in the chaos of a new family			0
but when he was sorting through his son 's soft toys deciding what to take to the charity shop , he came across the old bears he 'd bought and decided to have a go at transforming them			1
he said : ' i individually hand - sculpt the bones , teeth and other organs from polymer clay or latex , then open the bear 's carcass , scoop out as necessary and glue the bones into place			2
' realistic : mr @entity16 uses his training in theatrical special effects to achieve the entirely realistic gore possibly for those with harder stomachs than most : these teddies by @entity16 have both sold some designs , including the @entity112 , have a strong wire frame retrofitted to ensure they keep their pose and do n't fall over			1
' the bones , teeth and other organs are individually hand - sculpted from polymer clay or latex , the bear 's carcass is then opened , scooped out as necessary and the bones glued in place			0
mr @entity16 then paints the bears and adds a wet - look varnish to blood and bones for extra realism			1
he said : ' each @entity129 takes in excess of eight hours to make , not including the time it takes for glue , paint and varnish to dry , and i price them individually depending on size , complexity , materials used and time taken			0
for adults only : these customised teddies featuring horrific injuries have both been sold to unknown buyers ' they 've all been great fun to make but of all the ones i 've made so far , my favourites are the @entity148 ones , holding their torn - out hearts aloft as a grisly gift to their lovers			2
' while the appeal of the gory bears may prove elusive to many of us , their appeal for others is obviously strong			0
mr @entity16 's online @entity159 store has sold out , while his undeadteds.tumblr.org website has attracted comments from enthusiastic fans , all of them female			1
one woman asks if he ships to the @entity167 , adding : ' i am dying to get one of your amazing creations ' , while another exclaims : ' these are perfect for @entity6 ! ' mr @entity16 told @entity172 : ' most of those who are interested in the bears are 20 - somethings , both men and women , and lots of people have been buying them as @entity22 's presents			1
' the demand is astonishing - as soon as i make them , they 're gone			0
i put up three new bears on my website this week and they were all sold within 90 seconds			0
' fans of the bears can also send in their own teddies and specific injuries , and mr @entity16 will customise them according to their requests			2
each to their own : the bears ' creator is racing to get more @entity22 's bears made in time to satisfy demand this disembowelled teddy , left , and bear with a gouged - out eye , right , have both been snapped up already if you go down to the woods today : this poor bear seems to have lost an ear and half a paw in a savage attack			0
