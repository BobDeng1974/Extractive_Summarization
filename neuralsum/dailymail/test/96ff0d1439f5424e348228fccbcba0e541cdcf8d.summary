avalanches and death - defying runs were too tame for one daredevil who decided to take extreme skiing to a whole new level by hitting the slopes on an active volcano			1
@entity8 shredded through the snow on the @entity11 volcano on the @entity12 in @entity13 while his friend @entity14 photographed his exploits			1
the adventure photographer looked on in amazement as @entity18 flew down the icy slopes , while lava from the 12,000 foot tall volcano bubbled furiously behind him			1
' the heat and cold at the same time was incredible			0
' the air temperature was around -25c ( -13f ) and the lava temperature would have been more than @entity32 ( @entity33 )			0
' seeing the contrast of the black and red lava to the white snow was like gold to my eyes , and to my camera			0
' amazing photographs show @entity18 silhouetted in front of the still erupting @entity11 volcano on the @entity12 in @entity13 ' seeing the contrast of the black and red lava to the white snow was like gold to my eyes , and to my camera			1
' @entity14 said after lying dormant since 1976 the volcano suddenly erupted in november 2012			1
during the eruption , which lasted more than six months , it regularly emits jets of burning hot lava up to 656 feet high after lying dormant since 1976 the volcano suddenly erupted in november 2012			2

the @entity12 is a 780 mile ( 1,250km ) long peninsula in the @entity54			2
@entity55 is one of 160 volcanoes on the island , 29 of which are still active			0

@entity11 is one of 160 volcanoes on the island , 29 of which are still active @entity14 added : ' the volcano was very active until the summer of last year			1
' it is still active			0
at this time no lava is coming out of it but that could change at any minute			0
' the photographer admitted he has been chasing shots of skiers on volcanoes for several years and said he was thrilled to finally capture the image to perfectly contrast the hot and cold conditions			2
he said : ' it was a bit unreal seeing @entity18 skiing near the lava			1
' i was chasing this image for around five years and have tried , unsuccessfully , at many active volcanoes in @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 and @entity81 - but things always stopped me			2
' bad weather often reduced the visibility , eruptions are obviously very unpredictable and skiers were n't always around			0
' so to finally get the view of @entity18 skiing in front of the eruption was a big deal for me - it really was beautiful			1
after lying dormant since 1976 the volcano suddenly erupted in november 2012 , spewing lava down the mountainside the air temperature surrounding the volcano was around -25c while the lava temperature would have been more than @entity32 ' the first thing i did when i got the shot was to scream to @entity18 ' we got it ! '			1
' after that i looked at the display more closely and saw that the composition was really good - @entity18 made a really nice turn as i took the shot			0
' the lava looked great from the volcano and i had the feeling of perfection which is always a good feeling			0
' @entity14 said he was fully aware of the dangers of taking such dramatic shots , especially when lava was still flowing from the volcano			1
' seeing the contrast of the black and red lava to the white snow was like gold to my eyes , and to my camera , ' @entity14 said he said : ' @entity18 was very brave for doing this - it goes without saying that being on active volcanoes is incredibly dangerous			1
' we did wake up one night when the lava flow changed direction and started to flow just 100m ( 109 yards ) from our tent			0
' things can go wild any time , but @entity11 was pretty much under control and we did feel safe			0
