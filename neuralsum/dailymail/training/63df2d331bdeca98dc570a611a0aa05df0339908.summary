sources told @entity10 that @entity1 is now ‘ running the show and he ’s not listening to anyone , ’ causing a ‘ huge problem			1
’ viewership has been slipping away from the today show as rival @entity15 has been gaining ground , winning the ratings war for the past two weeks			1

additionally , in the 10 weeks before @entity43 quit , @entity65 got 4.94 million viewers , but in the 10 weeks since she left there were just 4.6million			0
the figures will be especially depressing for @entity5 as they include its coverage of the @entity70			2
the network had hoped the $ 2.3billion that it paid for the exclusive rights to screen @entity74 would give it a huge ratings boost			2

now however @entity43 has had her ‘ revenge ’ and the decision to fire her seems to have backfired			0
