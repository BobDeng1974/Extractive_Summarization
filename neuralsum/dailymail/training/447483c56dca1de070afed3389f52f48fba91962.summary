when the @entity1 was first envisioned , designers imagined a device packed full of sensors that could measure heart rate , stress levels , blood pressure and more			1
but a report now claims that , one - by - one , many of these sensors were dropped because they were unreliable or erratic			1
sources told @entity11 that the watch even became dubbed ' black hole ' internally because it continued to suck in resources for four years			0
according to reports , the @entity16 firm experimented with sensors for its @entity1 ( range pictured ) that measured conductivity of the skin to track stress levels and monitor heart - rate , but ‘ these features did n’t perform consistently on some people , including those with hairy arms or dry skin ’ the report added that @entity1 also struggled to find a purpose for the watch after the sensors were ditched , and were left ' wrestling with why a consumer would need or want such a device			1
' @entity1 has not responded to @entity36 's request for comment			2
@entity1 is expected to launch the smartwatch in march with prices starting at $ 349 , although a high - end 18 - karat gold model could cost thousands of dollars			1
according to reports , @entity1 experimented with sensors that measured conductivity of the skin to track stress levels and monitor heart - rate , but ' these features did n't perform consistently on some people , including those with hairy arms or dry skin '			1
the results were also said to have varied on how tightly the watch was being worn			0
@entity1 co-founder @entity53 has previously been critical of smartwatches but in an interview with the @entity56 he has said the @entity1 's display is ' like a little piece of art. ' he believes people in ' hip , camp areas ' will want it instantly , as will @entity1 's existing customers , meaning ' millions of people will buy this watch from the start and that helps get the critical mass going			1
' mr @entity53 co-founded @entity1 with @entity69 during the 1970s , and was responsible for designing the @entity71 computer			2
he left the company in 1987			0
he recently said that no company has yet been able to create a ' compelling ' smartwatch , and he had been disappointed with early models of the technology			0
' like @entity1 did with smartphones , one company may point the right way to a smart and useful watch , but it should n't be a replacement for what the phone does , ' continued mr @entity53			1
other sensors , such as detecting blood pressure and oxygen , were inconsistent and too complex and would have needed regulator approval			0
however , @entity1 did n't remove all the sensors			1
on the back of the case , a ceramic cover with sapphire lens covers a sensor that uses infrared and visible - light leds and photodiodes to detect heart rate			1
@entity1 will use this sensor , along with an accelerometer and the gps and @entity100 in a paired @entity101 , to measure physical movement			2
this will work with the @entity105 app that can set @entity107 goals , track exercise and make sure the wearer does n't sit down for too long			2
there will additionally be a workout app to motivate wearers			0
plus , developers will be able to create new apps with @entity1 's @entity115			2
the more complex features may also be included in future models , said ' people familiar with the matter '			2
@entity1 has asked its @entity121 suppliers to make 5 - 6 million units of its three @entity1 watch models for the first - quarter , the @entity11 reported , citing people familiar with the matter			1
@entity128 - based @entity127 , the sole assembler of the @entity1 , started mass production earlier this year to get ready for an april launch , the @entity11 said			1
thousands will work round the clock during the @entity136 holidays at @entity127 's factory in @entity138 , @entity139 , the newspaper reported , quoting one person			0
analysts predicts sales of wearables will grow from 29 million in 2014 to 172 million in 2018 , with a spike in 2015			1
@entity146 's latest forecast believes the most popular devices will be smartwatches and fitness trackers			0
@entity150 , @entity146 's @entity151 said : ' @entity152 will be instrumental in taking the wearables market to the next level of growth			0
if successful , it 'll create a rising tide that will lift the whole market			0
' ' if the @entity1 performs as well as expected , its halo effect will result in a sales bonanza in the second half of 2015 , with record - breaking shipments in the important fourth quarter			1
' last month , reports emerged that even without all these sensors , @entity1 's watch will only last 19 hours on a full charge			1
the results were also said to have varied on how tightly the watch ( pictured ) was being worn			0
other sensors , such as detecting blood pressure and oxygen , were inconsistent and too complex , and would have needed regulator approval			0
the report added that @entity1 also struggled to find a purpose for the watch @entity1 did n't remove all the sensors			1
on the back of the case is a sensor that uses infrared and visible - light leds and photodiodes to detect heart rate @entity1 fan site @entity185 said : ' for the first time , people with knowledge of the @entity1 's development have provided us with the specific performance targets @entity1 wants to achieve for the @entity194 battery , but the actual numbers may fall short of those targets			1
' according to our sources , @entity1 opted to use a relatively powerful processor and high - quality screen for the @entity1 , both of which contribute to significant power drain			1
' it said @entity1 wanted the watch to provide roughly 2.5 to 4 hours of active application use versus 19 hours of combined active / passive use , three days of standby time , or four days if left in a sleeping mode			1
but , the site 's sources said @entity1 will only likely achieve approximately two to three days in either the standby or low - power modes			2
last year , designers created an online demo of how apps may work on the @entity1			2
created by pipes , the interactive watch is modelled on official images released by @entity1 , and lets people see how their messages , emails and homescreen will look and work			1
the demo also shows how push notifications will appear , and lets users control music on the virtual watch			0
@entity1 will use this sensor , along with an accelerometer and the gps and @entity100 in a paired @entity101 ( pictured with boss @entity229 ) , to measure physical movement			2
the more complex features may also be included in future models , said ' people familiar with the matter ' @entity1 's chief executive @entity229 ( pictured ) unveiled the watch at a launch event in september			1
in december , reports said @entity1 is ' finishing up ' work on the watch 's software and it could go on sale in march so far @entity1 has refused to reveal exactly when it will be released , although a statement made to @entity1 employees suggests the release will be in ' the spring			1
' it was previously claimed that suppliers were struggling to make enough screens and processors			2
unveiled on 9 september at @entity1 's @entity101 launch event , the @entity1 is the company 's first foray into wearables			1
built - in is a ' taptic engine ' that responds to a subtle vibrations users feel on their wrist for notifications the watch has a completely new user interface , different from the @entity101 , and the ' crown ' on the @entity1 is a dial called the ' digital crown			1
' users can turn the crown to zoom in and out on a map , or scroll a list			0
the crown can also be pressed to take the user back to the home screen			0
different areas on the watch face can be customised with taps and swipes , and force touches			0
the @entity275 feature shows info users would like to see , similar to @entity277 , and is accessed by swiping the screen up from the bottom			0
music can also be controlled on an @entity101 through the @entity1			2

it understands questions in messages and then offers pre-selected answers , and messages can be dictated to the @entity101			0
users can also talk to the watch and send a voice reply , or have it transcribed to them			0
there is no keyboard on the watch , and messages can only be sent through dictation , or emoji			0
@entity299 is also built into the @entity1			0
@entity300 , @entity301 , @entity302 , @entity303 and @entity304 have already launched their own smartwatches , but @entity1 is expected to face unprecedented demand for its timepiece			2
@entity127 , which is building the watch , has upped its number of workers from 2,000 to 10,000 and is ultimately aiming for 20,000			0
the initial round of shipments will be 3 to 5 million watches , and @entity1 anticipates a total of 24 million watches to be shipped during 2015			1
last year , designers created an online demo of how apps may work on the @entity1			0
created by pipes , the interactive watch ( pictured ) is modelled on official images released by @entity1 , and lets people see how their messages , emails and homescreen will look and work clicking the mouse and moving it to the left and right will swipe through pages on the watch 's face			1
and clicking an individual icon will open that particular app ( @entity335 app pictured left )			0
for example , clicking the @entity337 icon opens a music player ( right ) and lets users press play and pause , and change the volume			0

according to reports , @entity1 experimented with a range of sensors
these included sensors that measured conductivity of the skin to track stress levels and monitor heart - rate
but they ' did n’t perform consistently ' on people with hairy arms or dry skin
the report added that @entity1 struggled to then find a purpose for the watch
asked its @entity121 suppliers to make 5 - 6 million units for the first - quarter
