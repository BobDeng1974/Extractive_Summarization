if you want to know the secret to staying happily married for 80 years , do n’t ask @entity2 – just go straight to his wife , @entity3			1
because apparently , 102 - year - old mr @entity2 will simply agree with whatever she says anyway			1
and that , he believes , is the key to their success			2
’ mrs @entity20 , 101 , sees things a little differently , however , insisting : ‘ we are very tolerant of each other and we do love each other			2
‘ you must n’t be hard on each other			0
and if you have to give in a little bit , you give in a little bit			0
’ yesterday the @entity28 marked their oak wedding anniversary , making them one of @entity31 ’s longest - married couples			2
the couple married in 1934 before they moved to @entity33 after the war because their house and business was destroyed by bombing over the decades they have endured more than their fair share of tragedy – losing two of their children and having their home bombed in the war			1
but despite the difficult times , mrs @entity20 said it is their ability to laugh together that has helped them reach the landmark			0
she said : ‘ it ’s been a wonderful marriage			0
it ’s been hard work and not without tragedy but we ’ve had so many good moments together			0
‘ it works because we just have the same sense of humour – we just laugh at the same things			0
’ it all began in 1929 when mrs @entity20 was 16 and working in her family ’s womenswear shop in @entity14 , @entity13			1
mr @entity2 , 17 , a travelling salesman , paid a visit and ended up staying for three hours , prompting his future mother - in - law to ask : ‘ who ’s going to throw him out , you or me ? ’ meanwhile , mr @entity2 had caught his future wife ’s attention because he had a car			1
‘ in those days not very many people had cars , which made him interesting , ’ she confessed			0
five years later , they were married , having waited for mrs @entity20 ’s older sister @entity77 to wed first			1
mr @entity2 went on to manage his father ’s factory and two shops in @entity13 before he joined the @entity81 in 1939 , leaving mrs @entity20 to run the business			1
then , just before d - day in 1944 , the factory , shops and their home were destroyed in a bombing raid			2
neither was at home at the time but they soon fled to @entity33 , where they have lived ever since after re-establishing their clothing business in the town			1
the couple faced more heartbreak when their son @entity95 died of a burst appendix aged four			2
and they lost a daughter , @entity98 , to a brain tumour in 1991 when she was in her 30s			0
the couple , now aged 101 and 102 continue to live in their own home with a live - in carer today their surviving children @entity104 and @entity105 visit them in their flat regularly , and so do their seven grandchildren and six great - grandchildren			1
although they have a live - in carer , they keep sharp by playing bridge			0
@entity104 , 66 , said he thought the secret to his parents ’ longevity was setting targets			0
‘ they wanted to see their grandchildren , and now they want to see their great - grandchildren grow up , ’ he said			0
the record for @entity31 ’s longest - married couple is thought to be held by @entity123 and @entity124 from @entity125 , who wed in 1925			1
two of the couple 's four children have died although their remaining son and daughter , @entity104 and @entity105 are regular visitors along with their seven grandchildren and six great - grandchildren their son @entity95 died of a burst appendix aged four their daughter @entity98 died of a brain tumour in her 30s			2
