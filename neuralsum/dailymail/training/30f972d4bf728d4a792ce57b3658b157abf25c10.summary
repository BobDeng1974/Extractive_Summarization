former @entity1 seamer @entity0 has lamented the standard of death bowling in the early stages of the @entity5			1
@entity7 coach @entity6 admitted his bowlers needed to improve after they conceded 105 runs in the final 10 overs during their opening defeat to @entity1			1
but @entity7 's problems have been put into some context by the fact that the average number of runs scored in the final 10 overs , when completed , in the opening five games of the @entity5 is a whopping 112 runs			1
@entity0 ( centre ) won three @entity21 with @entity1 during his stellar @entity23 career @entity0 celebrates a wicket , and the @entity26 legend insists his method of bowling would still work @entity1 's equal leading one - day international wicket - taker @entity0 believes bowlers have forgotten the ' art ' of a yorker at the death and suggested he would have been able to combat new - age shots such as ramps and reverse sweeps			1
' it still comes down to execution			0
in the final 10 overs if you can bowl good yorkers at will , and pretty much hit them , then you are going to be successful , ' @entity0 , a three - time @entity5 winner , told @entity43 's website			1
' it seems that because people have put the ramp in that bowling yorkers at the death is a dying art , which just bewilders me			2
' the new shots have come in but i felt that i probably could have combated that			0
@entity53 comes back to executing and being able to bowl the ball where you want to bowl			0
' if you can do that you are going to be successful in any era			2
' @entity6 conceded after @entity7 's 111 - run defeat to @entity1 that his side had under - used the yorker			1
however , the 52 - year - old believes his bowlers ' greatest crime was not bowling to their field as they were instead lulled into a shorter length to try to make @entity1 hit to the longer boundaries on the off and leg sides at the @entity70			1
@entity7 's bowlers struggled at the death against @entity1 , conceding 105 runs in the final ten overs @entity75 puts his head in his hands after conceding more runs to @entity79 in @entity80 ' the yorker is a really good ball , but you 've got to bowl the right ball to the right field , ' @entity6 said			1
' if you look at the stats for the best in world cricket , they do n't just bowl yorkers - but they do bowl yorkers			0
' ( @entity1 pace bowler @entity96 ) @entity95 is a yorker bowler , but some are not and they bowl a heavy length with slower balls			2
you have to go to your strengths			0
' so we have certain bowlers who lend themselves to going full with yorkers ; others wo n't use it quite as much			2
' @entity7 play their second game against @entity108 on friday in the smaller surrounds of the @entity110 - which is primarily a rugby venue - and in the coming days @entity6 is set make clarifying his bowlers ' plans in the late overs a priority			1
' we have to go away , look at that and decide what are we going to do ? ' he said			0
@entity6 says his bowlers will have to bowl better if @entity7 are to make an impression at the @entity5 ' how are we going to get clear on that ? we have to move and we have to move fast because these games are going to keep coming - and the last 10 to 15 overs are n't going to go away			1
' @entity124 will tell his bowlers not to try to double bluff the @entity108 batsmen who , with the likes of @entity128 and @entity129 down the order , have built a reputation in for big hitting late			0
' the key for whoever bowls at that time is to be clear and committed in what they 're trying to do - and then bowl to their field , ' @entity6 said			2
' now that 's a tough thing			0
there are only four men out , rather than five , so that 's harder and what i do n't think you do is try to double bluff people			0
' you bowl to the field you 've set and back your skill levels to get the ball in the right area to make it very difficult for them to get past the boundary man			0

final ten overs of innings are averaging over 100 runs so far
@entity7 conceded 105 against @entity1 , *criticised* by coach @entity6
@entity0 says bowlers can still be successful with good yorkers
