@entity1 manager @entity0 claimed @entity2 played like ' a small team ' and likened their approach to @entity5 in the 1 - 1 draw at the @entity7			1
unlike the @entity10 , who recorded a surprise victory last month , the @entity9 side left with a draw after substitute @entity14 scored a late equaliser against his former club to cancel out @entity18 's goal			1
for the second successive season @entity2 , who had a 100 per cent record prior to kick - off , came looking to frustrate and primarily avoid defeat			1
@entity0 questions @entity2 manager @entity24 during the tense draw the the @entity26 former @entity2 star @entity14 refuses to celebrate scoring @entity1 's late equaliser while it paid off previously this time they slipped up as @entity1 fought back despite having @entity31 sent off for a second bookable offence			1
' it think we played 90 minutes against a small team trying to defend , trying to keep 10 players in front of their goal , and ( we were ) a team that wanted to win from the beginning , ' he said			2
' i think we played against exactly the same team we played against @entity5 here			1
' it was very difficult for us to score but finally we did score			0
i do n't want to analyse @entity2			1
what the other teams do , it is not my duty to analyse			0
' @entity24 and @entity0 have never seen eye to eye , with the @entity50 attacking the @entity2 manager 's tactics @entity24 , whose relationship with @entity0 dating back to their time in @entity55 could be described as frosty at best , rejected the accusations			1
' many times he says he never speaks about me and my team but he keeps doing the same thing , ' said the @entity59			0
' i am the one that does as he says			0
i do n't comment on his words			0
do n't ask me about his words , i am not interested in that			0
' it is one point won because we arrived here leaders with two points more than second and we leave the stadium with a three - point lead			2
' i do n't look to direct opponents , i do n't look to other clubs in a special way			0
i look to the table and we are leaders by three points			0
@entity0 instructs @entity77 against @entity2 , who he feels played like ' a small team ' at the @entity26 ' we come here to a super-difficult stadium and a super-difficult opponent and we leave in better conditions than we arrived , so good			1
' we hit the post ( through @entity83 ) with a 1 - 0 lead and when you do n't kill matches , you are in danger , especially when you play against very good teams			1
' we had a tactical reaction to try to win the game			2
they had an emotional reaction to try not to lose the game			0
@entity94 scored a fine solo goal to steer @entity5 to a shock 1 - 0 win over @entity1 last month ' we were successful in our tactical change to try to win the game because we scored and had more chances to score and they were successful in their emotional reaction and i think in the end from my perspective the point is maybe a point that they deserve			1
' @entity24 let @entity14 go at the end of last season and he subsequently joined @entity1 's @entity111 venture in @entity112 being loaned back to the parent club , but he did not want to comment on the midfielder 's significant contribution to the result			1
' i do n't speak about players from other teams , i am sorry			0
i do n't speak about @entity14 , ' he added			0
' to speak about @entity14 is to speak about my past with @entity14 , the player he was for what he means in my career			0
@entity14 arrives late in the box to score @entity1 's equaliser and deny @entity2 three points at the @entity26 ' i will never tire to speak about this			1
the moment he is a @entity1 player , he is a @entity1 player			2
' mr @entity0 , instead of speaking about other teams ' players , should speak about @entity14			2
' i am @entity2 manager , i speak about my players			2
' @entity0 , however , was only too happy to talk about the 36 - year - old 's contribution			1
' when i sent @entity14 into the game i told him go and score			0
i was so sure @entity14 would play well against @entity2 because he is a very good professional , ' said the @entity50			2
