by @entity0 published : 08:06 est , 12 november 2013 updated : 13:29 est , 12 november 2013 the owner of a care home where elderly residents were dragged across the floor has dismissed a damning inspection report claiming it was based on a ' bad day '			1
care inspectors found residents were left lying on filthy mattresses at @entity10 , in @entity11 , while poor cleanliness also exposed them to the risk of infection			1
the @entity16 report said poor staffing levels meant patients were at risk of being neglected while inspectors also found ' unpleasant odours ' , stains on patients ' mattresses and filthy commodes which had not been cleaned properly			1
a damning report has revealed elderly residents at @entity10 , in @entity11 , were dragged across the floor and left lying on filthy mattresses but owner @entity29 has defended the care home , saying : ' it was just one of those bad days where certain things were n't right			1
it was nothing major and i am dealing with the @entity16 on it			1
' there are other homes in the area which have had much worse reports but they do n't get taken out of proportion like this			0
' the @entity16 has changed the goal posts slightly and that is something we are dealing with			2
' we ca n't have changed overnight and our report in february was good , we have exactly the same staff			2
' mr @entity29 , who has owned the home since 2009 , said : ' the staffing has improved since i have been here			2
' the families like what we do and we move people on if we ca n't care for them			2
' @entity16 inspectors gave the care home a deadline of october 30 to improve its standards			1
inspectors from the @entity16 ( @entity16 ) demanded improvements at the home , which caters for 18 residents who mainly suffer from dementia inspectors have not yet revisited the home to check if the standards are being met but will publish a further report in due course when they have			1
the care home failed all six requirements and for five of these areas the @entity16 said action was needed			1
these included the residents consenting to any care and treatment given , the care and welfare of people at the home , the home 's cleanliness and infection control , the home 's staffing and how their records are kept			1
' it was just one of those bad days where certain things were n't right			0
it was nothing major and i am dealing with the @entity16 on it ' - care home owner @entity29 but for assessing and monitoring the quality of service the @entity16 has taken enforcement action against the home - the most severe warning the watchdog can issue			1
on three occasions staff ' dragged ' patients across the floor of the care home by their walking frames while ordering the residents to ' come on ' if they were too slow			1
another patient was also left lying on the floor after falling during the night			0
poor records meant staff had no idea how long the person had been left stranded			0
the report said : ' we found the items listed were not clean and had sustained heavy soiling			0
' for example , some of the commodes had stains to the pans and dried brown matter to the frames and under the seat of the chairs			0
' inspectors also found dirty laundry stored in an open laundry basket with more heavily soiled items stored in the washing machine because ' staff told us they were only allowed to wash clothes at night '			2
the report added : ' we found that all of the mattresses we looked at were stained and had unpleasant odours			0
' the care home failed in all six of the inspection criteria staffing levels were deemed inadequate to deal with the needs of all 18 residents in the home and relief workers were not called in if staff failed to arrive for a shift - piling ' more pressure ' on staff on duty			1
the report said : ' we noted from one person ’s care records that they had fallen during the night but staff were unable to determine the time this person had spent on the floor			1
' for example , this person had been observed at 2.30am and found on the bedroom floor at 4am			0
' we saw three instances where staff led people by dragging their frames			0
they encouraged people by saying : " @entity163 " to hurry people along			0
' this was because there were not enough staff to help people to the dining rooms			0
' the inspectors flagged the incident as ' unsafe ' and received assurances it would be immediately addressed			0
the inspection also found care plans were not reviewed regularly and kept up - to - date and that monitoring and record - keeping of the service provided was inadequate			2
many of the residents at @entity10 suffer from dementia - related illnesses and the @entity16 ordered owner @entity181 to make improvements or face possible closure			1
the report concluded : ' we have taken enforcement action against @entity181 to protect the health , safety and welfare of people using this service			0
' @entity193 and the county ’s three clinical commissioning groups have also been informed of the inspection			0
in a joint statement , they said : ' @entity193 is aware of the concerns that have been raised and is working with @entity200 to support the home to improve the quality of care provision			2
