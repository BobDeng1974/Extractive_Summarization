right up to its last meaningful moments — the somewhat whimpering surrender of wednesday ’s final four games — @entity5 ’s reign as @entity7 champion never went to plan			1
a lack of motivation last summer , spinal surgery in september , the loss of his coach in march , the long haul back without reaching a final — the fairytale of 2013 turned out to be shortlived			0
and then came @entity17 to administer the last rites in a fashion few expected			2
the 23 - year - old @entity20 always possessed the means to make this difficult but the margin of 6 - 1 , 7 - 6 , 6 - 2 seemed unthinkable at the start of the day			1
it took 77 years for a @entity48 man to win @entity7 again and , with this particular match , you wanted to see more of a full - blooded scrap when it came to retaining the title			0
of course the @entity20 deserves huge credit for pulling off what should be a career - changing win , and the three magnificent points he played from 4 - 4 in the tiebreak to go two sets up were the stuff of great champions			1
we have waited years for a breakout performance from a younger player on the @entity28 , now two have come along in 24 hours with 19 - year - old @entity66 and @entity17			1
when he went two sets up it was the same situation as in the quarter - final a year ago , when @entity5 looked like he was going to lay an egg against @entity71 of @entity72			1
he rescued himself from a poor start then but against this calibre of grass - court player , with the confidence of the recent @entity78 title behind him , that was never likely			0
perhaps we overestimated @entity5 ’s chances based on his first four matches and discounted too much the struggles of the past 12 months			2
what maybe hurt him most is not having banked any top 10 wins since beating @entity85 here last year			0
the belief such victories bring was lacking at the first sign of a difficult challenge			0
what happened was actually part of a pattern of lame @entity94 defeats for @entity5			2
shocked : @entity95 of @entity96 and prince @entity97 do not know where to look as @entity5 went down in straight looking nervous : @entity95 of @entity96 looked on from the @entity99 at @entity7 tough viewing : @entity95 of @entity96 looks on as @entity5 crashes out ca n't watch : @entity95 of @entity96 looks shocked as @entity5 crashes out disappointed : the @entity101 and @entity102 applaud at the end of the match in the past four he has played well and then bombed without warning			1
those defeats came against @entity108 at the @entity109 , @entity110 in @entity111 , @entity112 in @entity113 and now @entity17			2
losing to any of them is no disgrace , but there has been a concerning element of acceptance each time			0
there will be some collateral damage from this hammering when it comes to @entity7			0
@entity5 had built up an aura about himself at the @entity124 , having won 23 of his past 24 matches here from 2012 , the one defeat being an honourable loss to @entity110			2
that aura has been well and truly blown away			0
small wonder that he spoke afterwards , encouragingly , about going away and working on much - needed improvements to his game			0
deep into his career at 27 that is not going to be easy , but it is possible			0
down and out : @entity5 was beaten in straight sets by @entity17 beaten man : @entity5 had no answers to @entity29 's precision maybe next year : @entity5 missed the chance to make his third successive @entity7 final @entity5 would not be specific but one area is bound to be his second serve , which finally met someone capable of punishing it			1
you are simply not going to beat anyone of the highest calibre when winning only 31 per cent of the points after your first serve misses out			0
the expectation was that the quality of @entity5 ’s return would give him an edge but that was turned on its head , with @entity17 even sharper in this respect			1
the @entity20 ’s superiority when it came to trading backhands was also unexpected			0
this is the stroke that has looked most improved by @entity5 ’s back surgery , but @entity17 ’s glorious , flowing , one - handed version proved the more reliable			1
the champion started well enough in creating a break point in the first game but then whacking his forehand into the net was to prove expensive , as it immediately settled the nerves of the younger man			0
barely 20 minutes later @entity5 , who thereafter made the error of just waiting for mistakes that never came , was looking at his worst @entity7 set since losing to @entity173 as an 18 - year - old in 2005			2
fan club : @entity177 's fans turned out in force to support the @entity48 no 1 looking good : @entity17 dominated @entity5 in the first set winning it 6 - 1 making him work : @entity29 raced into a two set lead and looked in control bad day at the office : having come through the first week of @entity7 with flying colours @entity5 came unstuck not at his best : @entity5 was swept aside in just over two hours by @entity29 his best chance of turning the match around came after being broken for 3 - 4 in the second when @entity17 , with girlfriend @entity189 nowhere to be seen , went through his only wobble of the match			1
@entity5 broke back and then got to 30 - 30 at 5 - 5 but could go no further			2
two break points needed to be saved in his next game and then came the tiebreak , which was evenhanded until 4 - 4			1
that was when @entity17 showed why he is ready to win this title			2
the next three points were magnificently executed under steam - hammer pressure , a ripped backhand pass followed by two well - judged forays to the net where he showed his volleying skills			0
a desultory double fault handed @entity17 the break at 2 - 3 in the third and @entity5 never even made the @entity20 sweat after that			1
a curiously flat performance leaves @entity5 with a reduced ranking , no titles and certainly no statue at the @entity124			2
perhaps this will be the easiest place from which to rebuild			0
no answer : @entity5 could not reproduce the form he had earlier in the tournament on the run : @entity17 was on top of @entity5 from the start marching on : @entity29 was at his best on @entity28 to beat @entity5 support act : @entity5 's girlfriend @entity221 watches supports from the player 's box face in the crowd : @entity5 was supported by comedian @entity226 on @entity28 watching on : @entity227 saw @entity5 lose on @entity28 @entity5 lost the first set 6 - 1 in just 25 minutes as his run of 18 straight sets won at @entity7 came to a tame end			1
it was his worst set since he lost the decider 6 - 1 to @entity173 during his @entity7 debut in 2005			1
it helped @entity17 to settle quickly in what was the biggest match of his career			0
the 2013 champion won just 31 per cent of second - serve points , while @entity17 won 59 per cent			1
@entity5 ’s second serve speed averaged just 86mph , 10mph less than @entity17			1
the @entity241 hit 12 unforced errors and only one winner with his normally reliable backhand			0
the poor side - spin slice he hit long to go a break down in the second set summed up his woes from that side			0
32 - @entity17 hit 32 winners on his way to victory , eight more than @entity5			1
@entity253 hit five double faults , three of them coming in the third set			0
this defeat marks only the second time @entity5 has lost to a lower - ranked opponent at @entity7			2
he lost to then world no 6 @entity260 in the 2009 semi-finals			0
@entity17 will now overtake @entity5 , who will slip to world no 10 or 11 when monday ’s new list is issued , his worst position since june 2008			1
@entity5 has still failed to beat a top - 10 player since his victory over @entity85 here 12 months ago			1

@entity5 beaten in straight sets 6 - 1 , 7 - 6 ( 7 - 4 ) , 6 - 2 by @entity17
defending champion misses chance to make third final in a row at @entity275
@entity5 will drop down to world no 10 at best once the @entity278 are over
