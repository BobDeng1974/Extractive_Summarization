a smiling @entity11 , wears her dress to go hiking and is captured perching on a rock on a sunny day in the @entity73 in @entity55 @entity11 demonstrates just how versatile her dress is , as she takes part in exciting activities , such as here in @entity45 the blushing bride relaxes , floating in the @entity55 @entity62 while catching up on local news @entity11 has no qualms letting a komodo dragon sit on her wedding dress in @entity45 @entity10 , 47 , a professional photographer , said : ' the gown has shown astounding durability , travelling in a backpack , slogging through mud and snow , swimming underwater , flying in a harness , and , of course , enduring many trips to the cleaners			1
' people often ask what our dry cleaning bill must be like , but because the dress is made with stretch lace over jersey it has unbelievable durability , we just take it to our $ 1.99 dry cleaner after each trip			2
' we thought for sure the dress would have been destroyed in @entity55			0
it was subjected to the extremes of the desert heat , a pop - up sand storm and the corrosive waters of the @entity62			2
however , after a quick trip to the dry cleaners it was ready for more			0
' people sometimes assume that we have an unlimited travel budget but we do n't			0
instead we travel through very cost effective means			0
' sometimes we combine trips with charity work and we have also collected hundreds of thousands of frequent flyer miles from cycling through credit card offers			1
' we 're more comfortable in a quaint youth hostel than a posh five star hotel and we always make our money stretch			0
' when they 're not travelling the pair also work in schools - @entity11 as a guidance counsellor and @entity10 as a computer - science professor - which means both have long summer holidays for country - hopping			1

@entity11 's bridal gown was designed to be carried in a backpack to suit their nuptials in the remote location of @entity147 but the dress would be stuffed into a rucksack on hundreds of occasions after that			1
on their website , @entity11 explains that their adventure began when she was looking for a wedding gown to wear to the ceremony they had planned on the edge of a volcano on the @entity177 island			1
since the dress would need to be ' flown over 7,000 miles , driven across an isolated island , and hand - carried up a sacred volcano crater , ' @entity11 wanted one that ' could be stuffed in a backpack '			1
she ultimately chose a strapless destinations by @entity184 gown with white lace overlay			0
on @entity147 , @entity10 set about trying to capture @entity11 in her dress in the best light , an endeavor that continued on into their honeymoon in the @entity191 and @entity192			1

' of course the project will evolve over time			0
a recent shoot ended with @entity11 fracturing her ribs , so perhaps it 's time to limit the daredevil shots			2
' but we 're already planning our next big adventure - a summer trip to @entity253 , @entity254 , @entity255 , and @entity256			2

we just thought to ourselves we should take another wedding dress picture here and there			0
' we travelled through some really remote parts of @entity192 and at first people thought they had stumbled upon a wedding , then they realised it was something much cooler			0
' i decided at that point to take my passion and make it our project			0
