according to the most recent @entity4 statistics , almost two thirds of @entity2 people are now overweight or obese and as a result , demand for gastric bypass surgery has shot up			0
but surgery does n't always provide the hoped - for outcome and as @entity11 , the 25 - year - old star of @entity13 documentary , my @entity14 , knows only too well , it can create problems of its own			0
@entity11 , and co-stars @entity17 and @entity19 , all suffer from the same embarrassing affliction - rolls of over-stretched empty skin that 's failed to snap back and has left them feeling ashamed of their bodies			1
miserable : @entity11 , 25 , was left with mounds of excess skin after losing 9st following a gastric bvpass it 's all the more galling for @entity17 , 30 , a school dinner chef , because unlike the other two , his dramatic 12st weight loss was the result of sheer hard work			1
' it was my fault , ' he says of his morbidly obese former frame			0
' i ca n't walk past a fridge without going in it			0
' if i 'd got a gastric band , i would n't have learned anything			0
it took a lot of hard , hard graft [ to slim down ]			0
' i was waking up to go swimming and do a mile in the pool , going to work and then going to the gym at night			0
' three years after he first joined @entity47 and hit the gym , @entity17 finally achieved the healthy weight he 'd been hoping for but says he 's been unable to move on with his life because of the huge amount of baggy skin he was left with			1
ruined : @entity17 says that his rolls of excess skin have hindered him in his quest for true love risk : although gastric bands will reduce bodyweight , they can also leave baggy skin behind surgery : @entity17 has since had his baggy skin removed after taking a second job and saving up ' in my head , it was get slim , get a girlfriend , settle down - all the things normal people have , ' he explains			1
but the excess skin has proved a hindrance - and he blames it for the end of his last relationship , a six week fling that collapsed after he plucked up the courage to show her his baggy body			1
' that 's the only thing i can think of , ' he adds			0
' it 's the body that put her off			2
' @entity11 , who lost nine stone after having gastric bypass surgery , tells a similar story and confesses to being reluctant to marry her fiance @entity84 while encumbered with pounds of excess skin			1
' i still feel fat and that 's because i have tyres , that are not tyres of fat anymore , but tyres of skin , ' she explains			2
she adds : ' i 've got a gorgeous family , i 've got @entity84 , i 've got my daughter @entity94 ... the only thing that 's not beautiful is me			0
' to get rid of it , both @entity17 and @entity11 applied for @entity4 - funded surgery			1
but with only one in 10 requests accepted , both were denied - in @entity11 's case because she still needs to lose another two stone to be eligible			0
although @entity11 has opted for therapy in a bid to come to terms with her extra skin , @entity17 has chosen a different route			1
after being denied surgery on the @entity4 , he took a second job at a local @entity110 and tackled a sponsored assault course and 12 mile run in a bid to raise Â£ 8,000 for a full body lift			2
' all parents do n't want their kids to suffer , they want them to be happy , healthy , ' explains @entity17 's father @entity117			2
' we 're the same with ours			0
' gruesome : @entity19 , who used to have a 2st 4lb lump of skin named ' @entity121 ' also appears on the documentary seven weeks after surgery , @entity17 is healed and ready to start his search for love			1
' all my negative thoughts about my body are going , ' he explains			2
' i 'm looking forward to going out and meeting people , ladies in particular ! he adds : ' everyone fears rejection - no one likes getting shot down - but i 've given everything to give me and my body a chance			2
' my baggy body , tonight at 10pm on @entity13			1

my baggy body follows three slimmers left with excess skin
two have had operations , while @entity17 , 30 , spent three years on a diet
between them , they have lost 43st but all have pounds of baggy skin
