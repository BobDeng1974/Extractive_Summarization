he told @entity28 : ' two separate things - why i decided to write the book is i wanted to tell my story about my time in politics and all the lessons that i learnt from it and , indeed , the lessons that both the @entity73 and other parties can learn from the way that i got brought into the political system and the way that effectively started to operate in a way that was unacceptable			2
' in terms of why i â€™m publishing it now , i was always going to write this book at some stage , i had more lucrative offers to publish it close to the general election when it would have caused more of a distraction and chose not to do that			2
i though the earlier i published it the better			2

@entity10 , @entity109 @entity108 , @entity110 , 1 hour ago career protesters butting in on everything annoy the absolute heck out of everyone except the seasonal ones of course , even his dog would n't stop joining in on attacking him even when it 's over , i 've really never seen that in a dog before , it was probably grabbing it 's own chance to protest at being dragged along to be involved in it 's owners no doubt numerous arguments whilst being made to wear awkward uncomfortable signs ( cruelty i 'm afraid ) like it 's only purpose to him is to gain sympathy and be a walking slogan billboard			1
wonder if the owner fed it properly as it was only annoyed at him and not the angry guy attacking him which is really strange			2
