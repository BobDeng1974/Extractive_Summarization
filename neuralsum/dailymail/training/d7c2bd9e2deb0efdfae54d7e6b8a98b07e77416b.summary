by @entity0 for the @entity1 amid the angry chants directed towards the board , another sound could be detected emerging from the @entity6 fans who filed dejectedly out of @entity7 on tuesday evening			1
it was the noise of thousands of heads being scratched			2
a low grumble of disaffected bemusement at precisely what @entity12 had been attempting to achieve with elements of his team selection , tactics and substitutions in the dire 1 - 0 defeat from @entity18			1
some are still wondering more than 24 hours on			2
it remains far too early in the @entity22 ’s tenure for any sweeping judgments about his future prospects in the role			2
make no mistake , however , this was a decidedly bad night on a personal level for the affable 38 - year - old			1
not happy : @entity6 fans protest after their side crashed out of the @entity33 on tuesday early exit : @entity6 were beaten at home by @entity18 after drawing the first leg in @entity37 a lack of investment from above may have created the loudest outcry but @entity12 now finds himself under serious scrutiny from supporters dismayed at two exits from the @entity33 in the space of three weeks			1
ultimately , the reprieve @entity45 handed down after the @entity47 debacle merely proved a passport to further ignominy			2
the blame game is already being played with a greater intensity than @entity6 managed against @entity18 but @entity52 is adamant the manager should not be left to carry the can			1
the @entity56 midfielder previously worked alongside @entity12 at @entity57 – where they won a first league title in 43 years for the club – and instead feels the burden of guilt lies with those on the pitch			1
‘ we are a team , ’ argued @entity52			2
‘ we lose and we win together			2
we had a match - plan and the players were not able to do it			1
so it is not the manager ’s fault			1
‘ of course he needs time to put his stamp on the team			2
i have told the media that since he came , that it takes time			2
it is not his fault we are out			2
‘ the manager made it clear what he wanted us to do and we wanted to control the game but it was us players who did not manage it			1
’ @entity52 ’s stance is correctly loyal and not without merit			2
but questions about @entity12 ’s decision - making are unavoidable in the wake of such a paper - thin performance			1
a clean sheet on home turf was all that was required after he seemed to get his set - up right in the 1 - 1 first - leg draw			1
unfortunately , the composure seen in @entity37 was replaced by confusion in @entity101 as @entity18 pressed @entity6 out of any fluency			1
blow : @entity104 of @entity6 looks dejected @entity12 ’s starting line - up was a source of debate from before kick - off			1
the decision to omit @entity110 was an eye - catching indication of his current status but understandable in the context of maintaining a midfield that had been effective the previous week			0
the logic behind playing @entity117 at right - back was less clear			0
the @entity120 international was all at sea during the first half , persistently out of position as if ordered to tuck inside and abandon the flank			0
his inclusion displaced @entity126 to centre - back , where the @entity128 partnered @entity129 to decent effect before succumbing to injury			0
it all seemed unnecessarily complicated			0
@entity134 @entity133 was implicated in the goal conceded in the first leg but had otherwise looked to have the makings of a decent double act with @entity129			1
joining him among the subs was @entity104 , a @entity141 international right - back who would be expected to be more reliable in the role than @entity117			0
an awful opening 45 minutes created a need for the ball to stick further forward			0
@entity12 reacted by bringing on @entity147 , which initially seemed to give the side a lift - albeit at the expense of lightening the central midfield			1
it was somewhat more puzzling when @entity154 was replaced by @entity104			0
he took up a post on the right side of midfield , with @entity158 switched to the left			0
the final change was forced by the injury to @entity126			0
@entity162 was introduced rather than @entity133 and another reshuffle was underway			0
three minutes later , @entity164 struck the goal that sealed @entity6 ’s fate			1
@entity154 had been grim in the first half but seemed to apply himself with real energy after the restart , contributing to an improved spell for his team			0
the @entity173 loanee told @entity22 media he was surprised to be taken off			0
‘ i wanted to stay on the field , ’ he said			0
‘ in the first half , we did n’t play well and nothing happened for us , but the second half was much better and i was enjoying it			0
‘ but the manager makes the decisions and he had a plan behind my substitution			1
i was certainly ready to play on and we had no agreement that i would be replaced			0
’ there is a sense that @entity12 is still grasping towards his best team and formation			1
perhaps that will only be clear if and when he is able to import enough of his own players			0
questions to answer : @entity6 manager @entity193 has endured a tough start to his reign at the club @entity199 , on loan from @entity198 , has yet to be seen because of injury			1
@entity201 has now been added to the squad after his loan from @entity204 was finalised , while a deal for striker @entity206 remains pending			0
will they be enough to make the difference come the @entity210 group stages ? the fact @entity47 – who routed @entity6 6 - 1 on aggregate - will be fourth seeds in that draw if they qualify suggests a wholesale improvement will be required			1
that was recognised by @entity52 as he faced up to a season without the financially - rewarding thrill of @entity45 ’s elite competition			0
‘ it is early in the season and , of course , everyone wanted to play @entity33 but we need to improve as players and as a team , ’ said the 23 - year - old			1
‘ we are in the @entity210 , we want to win the league and the @entity229			0
we need to get our heads up as soon as possible			0
it is tough now and it is going to be difficult but we need to do that			2
‘ to be honest , we are not good enough ( for the @entity33 ) right now			1
we have the @entity210 now and we have to improve			0

@entity6 failed to make the group stages of the @entity33
@entity101 champions lost to @entity18 at home in the second leg
