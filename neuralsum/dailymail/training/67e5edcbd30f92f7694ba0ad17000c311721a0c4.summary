by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 08:16 est , 28 may 2013 updated : 12:26 est , 28 may 2013 the @entity3 still has n't spent more than a third of the $ 303million it raised to assist victims of the storm even seven months after @entity8 ravaged much of the @entity9			2
the charity organizers say that it is n’t an accident that more than $ 100million of the funds have been left unspent , saying that their strategy will help address needs that were n't immediately apparent in the disaster 's wake			1
the revelations about the slow spending comes the same day as president @entity20 is due to meet with @entity22 governor @entity21 for his second tour of the damaged areas since the storm hit in late october			1
now : the @entity27 roller coaster , seen here on may 14 , is still in the water in @entity30 , @entity22 as it was revealed that the @entity3 has yet to distribute more than $ 100million in donations back together : president @entity20 arrived in @entity22 on tuesday morning and was greeted by governor @entity32 so that the two could tour the damage ready to roll : even though he has been criticized by members of his party for appearing chummy with the @entity39 president , he brushed those slights aside saying he is doing what is best for his constituents some disaster relief experts say that 's smart planning but others question whether the @entity3 should have acted with more urgency in the weeks after the storm and left long - haul recovery tasks to someone else			1
storm victims could have used more help this past winter , said @entity53 , director of the @entity54 at the @entity55			2
there was n't enough decent housing , ' she said			2
' given the lingering despair , it 's hard to understand the argument that “ we are setting that money aside			2
” ' as @entity66 open their wallets to assist tornado victims in @entity69 , the @entity3 is again emerging as one of the most important relief organizations on the ground and also one of the most prodigious fundraisers for victims			0
as of thursday , it had raised approximately $ 15million in donations and pledges for the tornado response , including a $ 1million gift from @entity80 star @entity79 and numerous $ 10 donations , pledged via text			1
the @entity3 was also the no. 1 recipient of donations after @entity8			1
the organization said it still had $ 110million remaining from its pool of storm donations as of mid-april , which were the most recent figures available			1
@entity3 officials pledged that all the money in its @entity8 fund will eventually be spent on the storm recovery and not diverted to other disasters or used to support general @entity3 operations			1
over the next few months , the @entity3 expects to spend as much as $ 27million of its remaining @entity8 donations on a program providing ' move - in assistance ' grants of up to $ 10,000 to families displaced by the storm			1
about 2,000 households have been assisted by the program so far , with an additional 4,000 waiting for an eligibility determination			0
promoting the @entity105 : the @entity22 government has spent millions in an advertising campaign and media onslaught in order to promote the @entity110 and encourage tourists to visit welcoming one and all : @entity22 governor @entity21 , seen here in @entity115 on sunday , has been extremely vocal in his fight to get the federal government to allocate emergency funds to the area part of the delay in spending , officials said , is to wait to see how the hardest - hit states allocate a $ 60 billion pot of federal relief dollars and address gaps in the government aid package			1
' we are waiting to see where the greatest need is going to be over time , ' said @entity131 , ceo of the @entity132			0
' we are more concerned with spending our resources wisely rather than quickly			0
' some disaster relief experts said holding funds in reserve was indeed a smart move			0
much of the toughest and most expensive relief work after a natural disaster comes not during the initial months but during the long - term rebuilding phase after the public 's attention has waned and new donations have stopped flowing , said @entity144 , associate dean at the @entity145			1
' it would be splashier , perhaps , to spend the money right away while the media is still there and the donors are still looking , ' he said			0
' but the important needs , from the cost perspective and the recipient perspective , take place after the headlines are gone and after the cameras are gone			0
' @entity3 officials noted that a year after a tornado killed 158 people in @entity161 , @entity162 , it found itself providing a new round of mental health services to survivors			0
then : the damage to the entire boardwalk and town of @entity30 immediately after @entity8 ( seen here on october 31 ) was widespread , but they have worked hard to make it ready for summer up and running : now the boardwalk and arcades are open ( seen here on may 26 ) in time for @entity174 weekend as the region depends on tourism for much of its economy comforter - in - chief : both @entity32 and @entity20 won praise across the aisles for their bipartisan work on the relief effort the cholera epidemic that killed thousands of people following a massive earthquake in @entity187 , where the @entity3 was also criticized for not spending donations faster , also did n't start until nearly a year after the disaster			1
the @entity3 says it is planning substantial grants to other nonprofit groups doing @entity8 recovery work and is doing much of its current work in conjunction with charitable partners with local ties			2
@entity3 volunteers working in conjunction with the organizing group @entity199 are going out several days a week to muck and clean flooded homes and remove mold			0
@entity3 staff and caseworkers have been holding ' unmet needs roundtables ' in hard - hit communities , trying to identify victims not covered by traditional aid programs			2
' our experience shows that as the recovery goes on , the needs of survivors will evolve , ' said @entity214 , @entity3 senior vice president			1
' it 's important to make sure some money is available for those needs no one can predict right now			0
' other organizations that raised large sums for the relief effort have also held back money while they evaluated the wisest way to spend it			0
the @entity224 , led by @entity32 , the wife of @entity22 governor @entity21 , raised $ 32million after the storm but did n't begin awarding grants on a large scale until april			1
so far , it has given about $ 11million , with the biggest grants going to local organizations building or repairing housing			0
the @entity232 , which raised $ 9.7million in a @entity8 recovery fund for @entity234 , @entity22 , @entity235 and some parts of @entity237 , said it has spent about $ 4million of that total to date , though another $ 2.5million is set to go out soon			1
high profile : prince @entity241 's visit to @entity30 in mid-may helped bring attention back to the area ' we always knew , from the very beginning , that our fund and our resources would be for longer - term strategies			1
we feel good about the timeframe , ' said @entity232 of @entity234 president @entity250			2
that strategy of holding some cash to spend later contrasts with the approach taken by the @entity254 , which was in charge of distributing more than $ 70million raised by a december 12 benefit concert by @entity257 , @entity258 and other music royalty			0
that fund was depleted entirely by april , with grants given to 400 relief organizations ranging from food banks to legal services to volunteer rebuilding groups			0
@entity267 spokeswoman @entity266 said the foundation moved as fast as it could because it believed that delays in government aid were leaving big gaps in services			0
@entity3 officials say they have the ability to meet both long - term and short - term needs , noting the organization has served 17 million meals and snacks , distributed 7 million relief items , mobilized 17,000 workers and volunteers , and provided 81,000 overnight stays			1
its efforts won over early critics like @entity287 borough president @entity286 , who assailed the @entity3 response in the days immediately after the storm but now praises it as having provided vital help			2
' they 've come a long way since @entity293 , ' @entity286 said .			0

charity has kept about a third of all donations , saying that they are earmarking them for longer - term *problems* that still may not have arisen
comes out the same day that president @entity20 visits @entity22 to see the recovery process
