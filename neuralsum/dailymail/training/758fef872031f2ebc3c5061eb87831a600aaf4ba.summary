how @entity6 must long for the days when he danced onto stage with the @entity2 in front of an adoring crowd of half a million in @entity5			1
that was in july , a few weeks before his return to @entity10 and the promise of a season in which he would silence the doubters and prove his worth as a world champion			1
there was , to begin with , a @entity2 hangover			2
but six months on and his sobering performance has left @entity10 fans and @entity21 nursing a banging headache			2
per @entity6 looks dejected after @entity10 were beaten 3 - 1 at home to @entity24 on wednesday night the defender admits that @entity10 will need a ' wonderful night ' in @entity24 to qualify for the quarter - final during wednesday ’s disastrous 3 - 1 defeat at home to @entity24 , @entity6 was at his indecisive and lumbering worst			1
and this , do n’t forget , was @entity10 ’s captain			2
for @entity31 ’s opener – deflected in via the @entity32 – he was lethargic in his closing of the @entity35 midfielder and his limp body was an all - too - easy detour on its path to goal			1
a @entity41 , for example , would surely have closed with more aggression and purpose			0
@entity6 continued to dither and unnerve until his fatal involvement in @entity24 ’s tie - changing second			1
for reasons only known to the 30 - year - old , he chose to chase possession inside the opposition half , a pursuit which was always destined to fail			0
@entity24 broke , @entity6 was a spectator and @entity52 – the former @entity54 reserve – climaxed their attack with a cool finish			1
@entity31 lets fly and his shot takes a wicked deflection off @entity6 's chest for the opener @entity52 enjoyed his second half strike which put the game beyond @entity10 @entity64 struck a sublime effort deep in injury time which appeared to give the @entity67 hope but that was extinguished after @entity70 punished more defensive laxity to make it 3 - 1 in the aftermath of the concession the cameras cut to the forlorn centre - back – for it took a few seconds to locate him on halfway			1
but his face was pained , remorseful for his part in the goal			0
even for the tie - clinching third he was slow to close the scorer , although he had been left brutally exposed by the shortcomings of his team - mates			0
ironically , @entity6 ’s best performance was saved for the post-match rallying cry he issued ahead of the second leg in @entity24			1
‘ let 's try to raise everyone 's level at @entity24			2
let 's try to get in our rhythm there			0
we could have scored more than three goals last night and we can hurt them , ’ he said			0
‘ we have to focus on that			0
we ca n't look back and think too much about this game			0
we will analyse what went wrong , but when we travel to @entity24 we have to be on the front foot , be brave and get the best out of ourselves			2
’ mertesacker celebrates with the @entity2 trophy in the @entity32 dressing room after their victory @entity6 leads the celebrations in front of the @entity32 fans after their @entity2 triumph in july ( left to right ) @entity113 , @entity114 , @entity115 and @entity6 celebrate in @entity5 after their win @entity6 can only hope they do not spend too long poring over the ills of the first leg , for he would take star billing in any dvd nasty			1
leadership – and , for a second time , let us remind ourselves he is the captain – comes from the heart of a defence			0
but @entity6 has cut a subdued and sulky figure all season			2
@entity131 ’s @entity130 tore into him following his abdication of responsibility during the 3 - 2 defeat at @entity135			1
it did n’t take forensic inspection to determine just how bad he was that afternoon			0
nor does it take analysis from the game ’s sharpest minds to pinpoint the weakness in @entity10 ’s side right now			0
indeed , from stumbling giraffes to turning cargo ships , @entity6 was the subject of social - media ridicule in the hours after the loss to @entity24			1
how he must long for the days of summer .			0
