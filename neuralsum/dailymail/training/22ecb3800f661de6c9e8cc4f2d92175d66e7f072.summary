by @entity1 reporter last updated at 5:06 pm on 21st august 2011 a @entity3 tourist detained in @entity4 after the suspected death of his travel companion is facing fresh questioning after a witness told police that the couple did not go into the sea			2
@entity12 , 50 , claimed that @entity13 disappeared two weeks ago as they snorkelled off an isolated beach			2
but a man who was fishing at the spot at the time the @entity19 woman is claimed to have vanished said that the pair left the beach without going into the water			0
he said that after they left , he never saw the couple again			0
the witness statement is yet another piece of evidence that points to inconsistencies in @entity12 's account of events			1
the new evidence came as another woman said that @entity12 had told her that he could make her ' disappear ' without a trace after she rejected his proposal to take her teen model daughter to @entity4			1
@entity12 allegedly telephoned @entity51 claiming to be a producer in late july after seeing pictures of her daughter on the @entity56 and told her that he wanted to take her 18 - year - old daughter to the island for a swimwear photo shoot			1
' he made the offer sound so wonderful that anyone needing the money or the modeling job would have gone , ' she told @entity64			0
shackled : @entity12 was not wearing one of his toupees			0
police had said they had struggled to trace the suspect 's movements on the island because he kept changing hair pieces insurance : @entity12 tried to redeem accidental death policy on missing woman @entity13 , which named him as a beneficiary , days before their trip to the @entity80 @entity79 island of @entity4 ' thankfully it was me who answered the phone and not my daughter			1
' during the conversation , he told me that he could make me disappear and no one would ever look for me			0
' also speaking on @entity64 , the @entity4 solicitor general @entity88 last night denied reports that a blood handprint had been found on a rock near where @entity12 was last seen with ms @entity13			1
' the detail about the hand print and blood is not true , ' he said			0
' that is not something that we have found , ' adding , ' let me put that to rest as that only hinders the investigation			0
' meanwhile , graphic , disturbing and ' beyond pornographic ' images are believed to have been found on @entity12 's camera of ms @entity13 , calling into question the relationship between the pair , who were at first believed to simply be travelling companions			1
inconsistencies ? @entity12 , left , speaks with detectives at @entity108 on the day after @entity13 disappeared being held : a judge on monday granted a request from @entity4 prosecutors to extend the detention of @entity12 for 16 days @entity12 's camera , as well as his laptop and cell phone , have been sent away for analysis			1
solicitor general of @entity119 - who called the 50 - year - old a ' mean b * * * * * * ' - could not confirm the nature of the images to the @entity124 but would only say it did not look like she was under any duress			2
meanwhile it emerged that the @entity19 businessman tried to collect the $ 1.5million accidental death policy he took out on her just two days after he reported her disappearance to police			0
@entity12 , who purchased the accidental policy shortly before travelling to the @entity80 @entity79 island with the 35 - year - old , tried to begin redeeming the @entity136 policy , which he took out just days before their trip and unusually only covered the trip to @entity4			1
according to a police source , @entity12 purchased a more expensive one - year policy instead of a more commonly purchased five year policy			2
@entity12 - a twice divorced father - of - three - is still fighting the accusations and is being held in an @entity4 prison			2
trouble in paradise : @entity13 was seen at this restaurant on the afternoon that she vanished the scene : the @entity149 in @entity150 , where ms @entity13 and mr @entity12 were reportedly staying during the holiday he still denies anything to do with @entity13 's disappearance and claims she vanished while they were out snorkelling			1
police are looking at a rock which is said to have a full hand print and blood on it that was found behind a restaurant that the pair were said to have dined in before her disappearance			2
on monday @entity12 was ordered to remain in an @entity4 jail for another 16 days while police investigate ' serious inconsistencies ' in his account of events			2
the @entity136 accidental policy is currently being investigated by the @entity170			0
court documents show the 50 - year - old has a history of domestic violence , has not been charged but remains the only suspect in the case			1
his attorney has said he had nothing to do with her disappearance and has called for his release from jail			0
officers having been tracing the movements of @entity12 in the hours before ms @entity13 's disappearance , but said they have had trouble identifying him in surveillance video because he frequently changes his toupees			1
video shows the pair at the @entity191 in the @entity108 area of the island where ms @entity13 went missing			1
restaurant staff have told investigators that the woman seemed woozy while they ate			0
surveillance footage also shows @entity12 in his rental car at the back of the restaurant , but the car had tinted windows so no one else in the vehicle can be seen			0
police said that they found blood on a rock behind the dive shop at the restaurant			0

@entity12 , 50 , being held over disappearance of @entity13 , 35
witness tells police he saw pair walk along beach , but disputes @entity12 's claim that they went snorkelling
statement is latest piece of evidence that points to inconsistencies in suspect 's story
video shows @entity12 arriving for questioning in handcuffs and without one of his toupees , which he *confused* police with by repeatedly changing
another woman says @entity12 *threatened* to make her ' disappear ' after she refused to let her 18 - year - old daughter go with him to @entity4 for swimwear photo shoot
investigators deny bloody handprint was found on rock near where ms @entity13 was last seen with @entity12
