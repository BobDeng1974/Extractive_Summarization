@entity0 has redefined the notion of ' world class ' , energising the tired term and catapulting it to a far higher plain			1
he has reinvented the manner in which we digest football numbers			0
@entity0 has – albeit with the aid of @entity9 – driven back the boundaries of footballing capability			1
@entity0 is full of energy despite the rough weather during @entity15 's training session at @entity16 the @entity18 star shows off some of his skills as real gear up for their seismic clash with @entity23 @entity24 gets a handshake from @entity26 ( left ) during @entity23 's run - out at @entity16 the @entity23 forwards showcases his trademark quick feet during the training session @entity0 ( left ) , like @entity24 , burst onto the @entity32 scene at 19 years of age on wednesday night , the @entity15 superstar – with 271 goals in 258 games for @entity15 - comes up against another player – 10 years his junior - who is fast changing the criteria by which we judge emerging talent			1
at 19 years of age , @entity23 starlet @entity24 is already the subject of national obsession within these shores , evidenced no less by the recent ' tiredgate ' furore			1
watch him on a football pitch , however , and it is easy to see why there is a fixation with his development			0
but can @entity24 , like @entity0 , take his potential and turn it into goals and assists , goals and assists , season after season , season after season ? @entity15 superstar @entity0 has netted 271 times in 258 games for @entity15 @entity0 proudly holds up the 2014 @entity62 award before @entity15 's game against @entity64 @entity0 was once labelled a ' skinny kid ' during his time at @entity67 but has since developed into a top athlete after all , the @entity69 forward once said : ' i really look up to @entity0 , he is someone that has always been an idol to me			1
' i try not to put pressure on myself , but i 'm looking to improve my goals - to - game ratio and try to chip in more for the team			0
' if i am not scoring i need to be assisting and making goals which is a massive part of my game which i need to improve on really			0
that is my main aim this season to get that goals - per - game ratio up			0
' here , ahead of the @entity87 showdown at @entity16 , @entity85 compares @entity24 to a rookie @entity0 during his early years at @entity67 … @entity24 , six weeks shy of his 20th birthday , has already made 68 @entity32 appearances @entity24 's strength belies his diminutive size and here he holds off @entity94 midfielder @entity93 @entity24 's shooting accuracy ( 56.9 per cent ) is vastly superior to @entity0 ( 41.7 per cent ) at the same age @entity0 ( left ) has , albeit with the aid of @entity9 , driven back the boundaries of footballing capability style at 19 , @entity0 was all scissor - turns and step - overs			1
he still is , of course , only now he invariably sticks the ball in the back of the net after such pageantry			0
@entity24 is already more direct , the tricks and flicks which characterised his game at 17 having made way for a more instinctive approach			1
both , of course , catch the eye with what is an increasingly rare ability to weave between defenders , leaving opponents in their wake and so exciting observers			0
stature do n't forget , @entity0 was once a ' skinny kid '			2
only later did he develop the world 's most recognisable – and muscle bound – torso			0
at 19 there was accusation that he toppled too easily and suspicion remained about his suitability for the @entity32			1
@entity24 's strength belies his diminutive size and it is said he has few rivals when it comes to bench - pressing in the gym at @entity132			2
opponents bounce off him in often comical fashion having under - estimated his power			0
mentality ronaldo in action for @entity67 against @entity139 in 2004 @entity140 spoke glowingly of a teenage @entity0 's mindest and attitude in his recent book			1
and it is that focus and determination which has allowed him to maximise his abilities			0
forget physical attributes , it is – and always has been – @entity0 's mental strength which tears him apart from the rest			2
@entity24 , of course , has not been without his off - field distractions			2
they can be forgiven for one so young , but failure to learn from such will only hinder his progress on the pitch			0
how badly he wants to emulate the achievements of @entity0 will ultimately determine his success			2
the numbers and so to the stats			0
@entity24 , six weeks shy of his 20th birthday , has already made 68 @entity32 appearances			1
@entity0 was still 20 , but a little older , by the time he reached that mark			2
but this , we feel , is fair ground for comparison … goals @entity0 9 @entity169 14 the @entity23 forward returned an impressive nine last season and already has three from five this time around			1
@entity0 , meanwhile , made a slower start in front of the posts and only managed a total of nine during his first two campaigns			2
shot conversion rate @entity0 6 % @entity169 19.4 % @entity0 loves to shoot , he always has			2
but 10 years ago a staggering 94 per cent of his efforts failed to go in			0
sterling fares far better , one in five of his strikes locating the back of the net			0
even @entity24 's shooting accuracy ( 56.9 per cent ) , outdoes @entity0 ( 41.7 per cent )			1
assists ( chances created ) @entity0 8 ( 90 ) @entity169 9 ( 112 ) @entity24 edges the goal assists by one , but perhaps he should look to his @entity23 team - mates for reason as to why that figure is not higher having laid on 112 chances			1
dribbles completed ronaldo 182 @entity169 what makes the pair so exciting is their willingness to get at opponents and @entity0 boasts slightly better numbers in this respect			0
@entity24 edges a young @entity0 in goal assists win percentage ronaldo 58.8 % @entity169 55.9 % @entity200 , of course , is ultimately about winning matches			1
and it is @entity0 who helped @entity67 to more victories during his early years , although only just			1
verdict the raw numbers have @entity206 slightly ahead of @entity0 at this juvenile juncture			1
but what the @entity209 forward has gone on to achieve is sensational			0
he has , as alluded to at the top , reformulated football			0
@entity24 can have no better role model , no better target to chase down			0
on wednesday night , at @entity16 , his idol becomes an adversary - there is no better stage for the boy to outshine the man he one day wishes to emulate .			1
