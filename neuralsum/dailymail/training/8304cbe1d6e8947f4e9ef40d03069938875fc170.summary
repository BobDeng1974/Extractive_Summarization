@entity0 insists that the star - studded reputation of his @entity3 ’s galacticos counts for nothing and his players have to prove themselves at home to @entity7			1
the @entity3 boss has spent £ 160million in the transfer window adding the likes of @entity11 and @entity12 to a formidable attack of @entity14 , @entity15 and @entity16			2
