prince @entity0 might not be known for his love of ten pin bowling but at least his attempt did n't end up in the gutter			1
instead , the @entity0 managed to knock over four pins - much to the delight of veterans and a watching @entity8 - although he was n't pleased with the result			1
@entity0 was at the @entity10 in @entity11 to meet veterans on the morning of his third day in the @entity12			1
the six - lane bowling alley gives the veterans who live at the home in @entity11 a recreational work out and keeps them active			1
with the @entity0 for the visit was @entity34 who looked wonderful in a pale gold coat and who looked on admiringly as @entity0 tried his hand at bowling but gave it a miss herself			1
chief petty officer @entity41 , who manages the alley , told that @entity0 , as he walked over to the lanes , said : ' i 've got a couple of bowling balls picked out , just try one			2
' with the @entity8 at his side @entity0 , who had turned down the offer of some bowling shoes , confessed ' i have n't done this for a long time '			2
but he gingerly picked up a bowling ball and sent it down the fifth lane more in hope than expectation			0
and its off ! @entity0 releases the ball and waits to find out how he 's done not good enough ! @entity0 managed to knock down four pins but did n't seem pleased with the result his execution looked good but the bowl ran wide and clipped three pins that toppled over and he turned to @entity34 and said : ' at least i got one '			1
@entity65 , an 80 - year - old retired staff sergeant from the @entity66 , said : ' he did pretty good , ' adding , ' i told him i was the worst bowler in this alley and he said " no , i am "			0
' the couple had begun their day by visiting president @entity72 's cottage and were met by @entity73 who is in charge of maintaining the property			0
looking around : the royal couple are shown the veterans ' art room having a chat : @entity0 and @entity34 appeared to be enjoying their tour and chatted to veterans hello there : @entity0 bends down to a veteran using one of the machines in the gym mrs @entity73 also had presents to dispense : a book entitled @entity90 for @entity0 and another called what do you do with an idea for his grandson , @entity95			2
afterwards , the royal couple were ushered to the @entity10 and were whisked into the @entity97 which houses many of the residents			0
along with a visit to the bowling alley , the royal couple were also shown the library , which boasts stunning views of the @entity104 , and the wellness facilities for the pensioners who live there			1
enjoying himself : @entity0 , seen here chatting to veterans , has received a rapturous reception in the @entity12 having a look : @entity0 and @entity34 pose outside president @entity72 's @entity11 cottage on their way : the royal couple leave @entity116 en route to their second engagement stunning : it was at the cottage that @entity72 dreamed up the 13th amendment which bans slavery the centre , which sits in the same grounds as @entity72 's cottage , is one of two in the @entity12 , with the other located in @entity129 , @entity130 , and was established in the late 19th century			1
not far away is the cottage itself , which is particularly notable because it was there that @entity72 lived for a quarter of his presidency			0
he also used the cottage during the @entity136 and dreamed up the 13th amendment , which outlaws slavery , while living there			0
@entity0 and @entity34 are on the third day of a four - day state trip that has been described as ' your grandfather 's royal visit ' by the local @entity143			2
the @entity0 laughs and gestures as he leaves @entity145 in @entity11 prince @entity0 is flanked by well - wishers after he leaves @entity147 in @entity11 , @entity11 students snap the royal on their smartphones after his visit to @entity147 where he learned more about their model for adult literacy prince @entity154 : @entity0 is surrounded by students during a visit to the @entity158 in a piece headlined , ' @entity34 and @entity0 do n’t get the @entity163 [ @entity162 ] treatment , but it ’s still royal ' , the paper went on to contrast the ' high - volume excitement worthy of boy - band ' that greeted the @entity166 with the quieter one offered to his father			0
but while @entity0 and @entity34 are n't getting the rockstar reaction enjoyed by the younger generation , the visit is seen as ' crucial ' - for @entity0 at least			2
that echoes comments made by @entity25 ambassador to the @entity12 sir @entity175 who described the tour as being a fillip for @entity23 relations			0
later , the royal couple will be whisked to the @entity180 where they will meet president @entity182 in the @entity183 for the second time since he took office			0
president @entity182 is the sixth @entity23 president to entertain @entity0 , who has visited the @entity12 on 23 separate occasions , during his royal career and is unlikely to be the last			0
students get a royal visitor as prince @entity0 drops into their classroom at @entity158 today big welcome : prince @entity0 has proved a hit with locals and has had a warm welcome in @entity11 nice flag ! a girl shakes @entity0 ' hand while another holds a sign welcoming the @entity0 tour : @entity0 nipped into the school as he and @entity34 left the @entity10			1
