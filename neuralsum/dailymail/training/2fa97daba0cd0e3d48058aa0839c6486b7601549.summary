spooning peacefully in a double bed , this pair could be any normal couple on a sunday morning			2
but revisit the scene an hour later and @entity4 will be curled up in the arms of another man			1
the 29 - year - old is a professional cuddler			2
she turned to snuggling with strangers to help pay for her studies and provide for her young son			2
the concept was that clients would be able to book in for an hour of hugs and cuddles for $ 60 snuggle up : model @entity16 enjoys a cuddle session with @entity4 , costing her $ 60 an hour she can make $ 260 a day and cuddles with up to 30 men a week - including pensioners and war veterans			1
however , her business ' the @entity23 ' has not gone unnoticed and her college has threatened to expel her - while others have called her a prostitute			1
she said : ' i think i was born knowing how to snuggle			2
snuggling is healthy , spiritual and fun			2
' i think clients come to me for all different kinds of reasons			0
some of my older clients , their wives have passed away , and they just need someone to be with , like someone to experience touch with			0
' some of the younger clients are between relationships , some are in problematic relationships , and some people are just really curious and they come to just find out what it 's going to be like			0
' @entity4 advertises her services online and charges $ 60 an hour			1
controversial : the 29 - year - old says that she has been called a prostitute over her cuddling service paying for intimacy : customers can snuggle anywhere in @entity4 's house but most opt for her large double bed novel idea : @entity4 started the business to fund her studies and support her young son the cuddling can take place anywhere around her cottage in @entity61 , @entity62 , but most clients opt to use her large double bed			1
they are banned from touching parts of her body covered by underwear , which she wears under pyjamas			0
the business has done so well she has even hired another snuggling professional , @entity71			0
her apprentice has yet to take on a client by herself but has joined @entity4 on two occasions in what they have termed a ' double cuddle '			1
despite her strict rules on sexual activity , @entity4 has received a barrage of emails and phone calls slamming her as a prostitute			1
sweet dreams : @entity4 came up with the idea which has become so popular she has had to hire a second professional cuddler eyes wide shut : model @entity16 enjoys a relaxing session with @entity4 , at her home @entity23 , @entity61 she added : ' some have said i am worse than a prostitute because they think snuggling is more intimate than sex			1
i 've been told i 'm monetizing love			0
' one of her repeat customers , who would only give his name as @entity100 , disagrees with her critics			0
he said @entity4 's cuddles had helped him following a bad break - up and described the sessions as ' meditative '			1
however , he said he would not continue to see her while in a relationship			0
' there 's no cheating element , it 's not immoral , i just do n't think it would be appropriate '			0
little spoon : like @entity4 , the @entity113 staff draw the line at intimate touching bedtime reading : @entity4 says she has a number of repeat customers @entity4 cuddles up to 30 men a week as well as a number of women			1
the @entity113 in @entity122 opened its doors to its first clients this week			0
