a university drop - out posed as a surrogate mother and robbed a childless couple of their savings in a ‘ cruel and hurtful ’ fraud , a court heard yesterday			1
@entity6 , 23 , preyed on the couple ’s vulnerability after they had suffered the heartache of miscarriages and three failed ivf cycles by falsely promising to help them start a family			1
but instead she disappeared with their money , leaving the husband and wife deeply traumatised			2
@entity6 preyed on the couple 's vulnerability after they had suffered the heartache of miscarriages and three failed ivf cycles she told them she was a court - approved social worker and claimed to have been a surrogate mother for a wealthy family who were prepared to vouch for her , the hearing was told			1
cookes , a former @entity30 student , then created a @entity32 account in the name of the fictitious woman and exchanged messages with the couple about the ‘ wonderful ’ experience			1
by the time the couple realised they had been duped , they had paid @entity6 £ 1,200 for ‘ contracts , legal fees and insemination kits ’ , and had already started planning for their longed - for family			1
despite her cruel deception , @entity6 was yesterday spared jail after the court heard that she had suffered undiagnosed psychiatric problems since losing her four - month - old daughter to cot death in 2008			1
last night her devastated victims , who can not be named for legal reasons , said : ‘ we are annoyed she did not get a harsher punishment – it ’s just a slap on the wrist after all the hurt she has caused			1
she ’s put us through hell			2
we can not believe that anyone can be so callous			2
’ cookes began the deception in february last year after contacting the couple through an internet forum for surrogacy			2
the couple , from @entity67 , @entity68 , told her about their failed @entity70 attempts , the miscarriages and their desire to adopt or foster			2
they were desperate to start a family and saw surrogacy as a last resort			2
cookes told them she had been a surrogate already , for a family from the @entity82 , who would be happy to provide them with references vouching for her			2
@entity88 @entity87 where @entity78 was spared jail after the court heard that she had suffered undiagnosed psychiatric problems since losing her daughter to cot death she then created the fake @entity32 account , using the name @entity95			1
in one message to the couple she wrote : ‘ i ’m extremely grateful to @entity6 – she has an incredible heart			2
she has given us a wonderful gift			0
’ cookes also gave them fake documents showing she had been a surrogate and even urged them to decide quickly because she had others on a waiting list			0
she then demanded payment for expenses – including travelling to see the couple at their home – and for her solicitor to draw up the contract			0
the couple used all their savings as well as money from the wife ’s business as they chased their dream of becoming parents			0
but after handing over the cash , they grew suspicious , @entity123 was told			0
cookes began avoiding telephone calls and text messages and persuaded them not to travel to her house			0
she claimed the hold - ups were due to ‘ tiny ’ problems with the contract			1
the couple , fearing they had been duped by a fraudster , contacted police who arrested cookes at her home in @entity142			0
@entity143 , mitigating , said : ‘ the whole case is one steeped in sadness			0
there is the couple ’s difficulty in having their own child and the false hope @entity78 gave them , and also the tragedy of her own loss in 2008			0
‘ even today , when she looks back , she does n’t see offering surrogacy as a bad thing , but she immediately became involved in a deception which she now truly regrets			0
’ cookes , of @entity160 , @entity161 , admitted fraud by false representation , and in a letter read out to the court apologised for the hurt she caused			1
‘ i truly am sorry , ’ she wrote			0
‘ now i am in intensive therapy , i can see that i never dealt with my grief after my daughter ’s sudden death and i am sorry this caused me to hurt other people			1
‘ i hope to resolve my mental illness … this will never erase my mistake , though			0
never again will i get myself into trouble … i never want to hurt anyone else again			1
’ cookes was given a nine - month prison sentence , suspended for two years , and ordered to pay the couple £ 1,890 in compensation			1
the judge , recorder @entity183 , told her : ‘ you have pleaded guilty to a very cruel and hurtful fraud … there was a great deal of sophistication and deliberation about that deception			1
’ he added : ‘ your victims were particularly vulnerable because their natural and unfulfilled desire was to have children			0
‘ they resorted to what , to some extent , was a last resort			0
it is little wonder to me that [ the wife ] , in particular , having realised that she was misled in such a cruel way , has suffered quite serious psychological consequences			0
