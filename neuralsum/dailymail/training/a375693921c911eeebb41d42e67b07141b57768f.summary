a mister and miss @entity2 competition has been launched in @entity4 - and claims it will be a ' helping hand ' to young gypsies because it judges them on intelligence as well as just looks			1
the pageant , which is currently auditioning in the @entity4 capital @entity10 , includes elements of beauty contests but also judges contests on their education , interests and ambitions			1
according to organisers , the competition - particularly the female portion - is a response to the reduced opportunities which gypsies in @entity4 received , and hopes to persuade girls that there is more to life than marrying young and having babies			1
she said : ' for a gypsy woman , the aim is always just to get married very young , at 14 or 15 , and have children			0
i want the gypsy woman to study and become independent so she does n't depend on her husband to give her â‚¬ 10 so she can eat			1
' figures have shown that a majority of gypsies leave school by 16 , and unemployment among @entity4 's 725,000 gypsies is as high as 36 per cent - 10 per cent higher than the national average			1

the five judges of the competition will be non-gypsies , and are supposed to judge contestants on their minds and personality as much as their looks			0
