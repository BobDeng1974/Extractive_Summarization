it was business as usual for @entity2 as he scored a double on the first day of the season for the fourth consecutive campaign			2
@entity6 won their first game 3 - 0 against @entity8 despite @entity10 ’s red card just before the break			1
@entity2 ’s characteristic brace was achieved without the suspended @entity13 and the injured @entity14 but he had more than enough help from @entity17 born youngster @entity16			1
the young striker will not be 19 until september 1 but already has @entity6 fans predicting a big future – if he can stay in the side when @entity14 and @entity13 return			1
@entity6 have now scored 26 goals in their last six opening matches and not since 2008 have they been beaten on the opening day			2
that front three of @entity16 , @entity27 and @entity2 was a clean sweep for the club ’s @entity30 youth academy as @entity6 kicked - off the season with the entire bench and six of the starters products of its youth system			1

host commentator thanks for joining @entity39 's coverage of @entity6 's 3 - 0 win over @entity8 at the @entity43			1

you could win £ 1,000 every week - more than enough to fly out to @entity6 to watch @entity2 live ! enjoy the rest of your evening			1
the referee blows the final whistle and it means @entity6 open up with a win			2
they are also top of the league - if that 's the sort of thing you read in to at this time of the season			0
can @entity2 get his hat - trick ? no probably not - as @entity6 do n't look too bothered now			1
it 's been a fine performance from @entity6 tonight - and the fans are recognising that by chanting @entity70 's name again			2
unsurprisingly @entity2 has been brilliant - but so have debutants @entity16 and @entity72			1
this team could take a lot of stopping this season			0
they have turned it down a notch now though - back into first gear for the @entity80 as they see out the final minutes of the game			2
@entity82 comes on for @entity83			2
@entity84 comes on to replace tonight 's @entity6 captain @entity85			1
it 's gone a little quiet here at the @entity43 - substitute @entity90 has the best chance since @entity2 's second goal but he is denied by the excellent @entity93			1
during this lull - here 's a video of the earlier ' cat ' incident : scorer of the second goal , @entity16 , gets a standing ovation from the @entity43 crowd after a brilliant debut that was capped with that great finish to tie things up at the beginning of the second half			1
the 68,105 - strong @entity80 crowd think they 've seen their next big star - and who 's to argue with them after that ? think the @entity114 would leave @entity2 tired ? you thought wrong			2
this time he beats three defenders - one of them twice - and slots the ball into the corner of the net			0
he latched on to @entity123 ' pass inside the area and did n't look to be posing too much of a threat until some trademark close - control took him away from multiple markers and opening up the opportunity for @entity2 to find the corner			1
@entity132 impedes @entity85 on the half - way line and goes into the referee 's book			1
they 're not throwing players forward at will anymore but @entity6 are still creating chances			2
@entity93 flies off his line to deny @entity16 with his feet after @entity2 plays him in on goal			1
in fairness to the young forward the ball was stuck under his feet and he was left with little chance to finish			0
@entity146 comes off with @entity147 replacing him			0
that second goal from @entity16 has effectively sewn up this game in @entity6 's favour			1
now they seem happy to sit on it and keep possession - and even with 10 men they 're managing that with ease			0
@entity155 still left looking for anything to do ... two debutants combine to double the lead as the second half begins ! @entity72 play in @entity160 with a brilliantly crafted chip and the youngster confidently fires home with a brilliant improvised finish			1
that should be this win sorted for @entity6			0
top quality all - round			0
@entity6 might have a new manager in @entity70 but this is very much the same from them			0
80 % possession , @entity2 on the scoresheet and looking shaky at the back - just like old times ! what a last five minutes of that half - @entity2 opened the scoring as he made the pressure pay but then @entity10 was sent off for bringing down @entity175 when he was through on goal on @entity8 's only real attack			1
aside from that , the half has seen @entity160 and @entity85 hit the bar - and the real star of the show : a black cat pitch invader			1
that changed quickly - @entity175 somehow finds himself through on goal for the so - far blunt @entity8 attack and @entity10 drags him down as the last man			1
referee @entity188 had no hesitation in bringing out the red even as @entity10 pleaded his innocence			1
professional foul - correct decision and @entity6 are down to 10			1
that should make this game a bit more interesting			0
the defenders can only stand and stare as @entity6 's little maestro produces a perfect first touch and runs past three of them before confidently finishing five years in a row he has scored on the opening night of @entity48			0
@entity2 plays a brilliant slide - rule ball through to @entity16			1
he 's in a great position to shoot but perhaps the 18 - year - old 's inexperience showed as the tried to square it to a non-existent team - mate			0
from a clever @entity72 free - kick @entity123 , sporting a questionable new bob haircut , comes from deep to strike at goal			1
it goes just wide with @entity93 stranded			0
79 % possession for @entity6 so far			0
@entity6 are getting closer and closer			0
@entity2 links up with the @entity215 playmaker again and he crashes a left - footed strike from range against @entity93 's crossbar			1
beautiful play from the @entity6 star men			0
they exchange successive one - twos which bring them to the edge of the area including a couple of backheels but are eventually crowded out by the packed @entity8 defence			2
this kid is good ... debutant @entity229 latches on to @entity85 's pass , turns and instinctively shoots from just inside the area , but he hits the woodwork			0
what 's that ? you want more pictures of the cat ? oh , ok then			0
the @entity80 are already camped deep in @entity8 territory tonight - and @entity2 is dropping deep to find the gaps that could open up their defence			1
eventually they make it into the @entity6 half a couple of times but they 're heavily outnumbered			2
@entity155 has n't even touched the ball yet			0
@entity70 is taking charge of his first game having previously played for @entity6 and after working with their youth academy			0
the @entity43 crowd sing his name			0
@entity2 is playing provider here and he picks out @entity123 ' run to play him in on goal			1
@entity8 's new keeper @entity93 comes out to deny him but brings down the @entity255			2
difficult decision made easier by the fact @entity123 was offside			0
@entity6 have started strong - they look sharp and we 've barely seen a misplaced pass so far			2
with almost 10 minutes on the clock @entity2 goes scampering down the right wing and a brilliant turn takes him into the box before he eventually opts for a cross that does n't quite meet the intended target			2
after the cat is eventually caught the ball can come into play			0
@entity6 keeping possession early on - although is that really news ? there 's a black cat doing the rounds of the @entity43 pitch			2
play has to stop and the cat keeps running on and off - stewards in pursuit but they ca n't get it into their clutches ... but then a man in a fluorescent jacket comes to the rescue , but ends up dropping the cat off the pitch			0
i hope @entity6 are n't superstitious ...			0
@entity8 just about survived in @entity48 last season following promotion from the @entity290 , eventually finishing just above the relegation zone in 16th			0
this summer saw them lose their best player , @entity293 - now of @entity294 - but they have made some additions including the earlier - mentioned @entity83 and former @entity298 winger @entity297 - although he misses out tonight			2
the club have big financial problems and are fifth favourites to go down this season			0
it could be a long night for @entity8 and their manager @entity304			0
@entity305 loanee @entity132 starts for the visitors in midfield tonight in a understandably defence - focused 5 - 4 - 1 formation			1
want to know more about @entity132 ? check out @entity310 's profile of the ' next @entity311 ' here			0
six of @entity6 's first line - up of new season homegrown including the entire front three : @entity16 and @entity27			1
you might have heard the names of @entity155 , @entity317 and @entity72 mentioned this summer but ' @entity160 ' is a fairly unfamiliar name on that @entity6 team - sheet			1
it is in fact @entity160 - another of @entity6 's youth academy products			2
an 18 - year - old @entity215 forward , @entity16 is one of @entity325 's hottest properties and scored a wondergoal for @entity6 's under - 19 side in the final of his age group 's equivalent of the @entity332 final			1
@entity70 gives out four full debuts at the @entity43 in a much changed @entity6 side			0
gone are the likes of @entity337 ( benched ) and @entity338 ( retired ) and in come the new boys			0
summer signings @entity155 , @entity317 and @entity72 join academy product @entity160 in making their @entity6 bows .			1

@entity2 opened the scoring with minutes left of the first half
but @entity10 received a red card for a professional foul too
@entity13 is still serving his biting suspension so misses out
