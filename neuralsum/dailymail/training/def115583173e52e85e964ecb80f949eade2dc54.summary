there are some debts which can never fully be repaid : the freedom which @entity3 and her people owe the mighty little @entity6 is one of them			1
when @entity3 stood alone against the threat of @entity8 , the @entity9 and ‘ the @entity10 ’ who flew them protected our skies and all that lay beneath			1
even today , almost three - quarters of a century after the @entity15 , the air - rending thunder of a 1750 - horsepower merlin engine and the sight of those curved wings slicing through the clouds can still lay claim to the heart of the nation			1
this is because back in september , the historic rules limiting @entity6 experiences to those who hold a pilot licence were lifted by the @entity42			1
@entity25 in @entity26 is the only company approved by the @entity42 to offer passenger flights in their @entity30 aircraft , which was originally designed to train fighter pilots			1
yesterday i was lucky enough to soar out over the white cliffs of @entity49 , the @entity46 limpid below and the late afternoon light torching into an orange parabola around the wooden propeller			2
it was an extraordinary experience ; the closest any of my generation will come to knowing what the @entity10 knew , that this is flying at its most graceful and elemental			0
we arced and turned and dived and climbed into the setting sun , the smell of hot grease and engine fuel wafting into the cockpit , the thrumming and throbbing of the plane ’s tiny carcass beating into our backs			1
and as we did so we felt the decades rapidly slip away – for the @entity6 is an icon of aviation , the years have not withered her magnificent power nor her silvery allure			1
at 280mph – using a mere fifth of the engine ’s capacity – and 500ft above the waves , we carved our own little bit of history along the fortress of white cliffs which would once have welcomed @entity3 ’s fliers home			1
i was flying in @entity81 , a @entity6 built in 1944 which is worth £ 2 million – and is one of just seven two - seater @entity9 in the world			1
the aircraft , which has a 1,750 horse - power @entity86 engine , is one of only seven two - seat spitfires in the world the flight in a @entity6 , pictured , could just about be the best @entity92 present any @entity93 might receive for next year i climbed in behind pilot @entity94 into a rear cockpit where space is so tight it ’s measured in fractions of an inch and there is no floor above the constantly moving controls			1
as the chocks are pulled away , the flaps lifted for take - off and the canopy closes over your head , it ’s almost like the @entity6 claims you			2
that much was expected , but what came as a surprise was the gentleness of one of the most brilliant war machines ever built ; so soft are the controls that the merest movement of the stick up or down or from port to starboard will send it skimming into another corner of sky			2
after flying over the @entity46 , we turned inland , reaching 2,500ft as a pale autumn mist rose beneath us			0
then we crossed the @entity122 up into @entity123 towards the @entity124 at @entity125 where @entity81 is to spend the winter			0
shortly before we landed , @entity94 pulled back the worn leather casing of the joystick , glanced at me in the cockpit mirror and gently pulled the nose up while turning the plane a full 360 degrees : a victory roll			2
as we turned , pulling 2.5 times the force of gravity ( @entity137 ) , i watched the world spin on its very axis and waited for my stomach to catch up			0
a few minutes later we accelerated to 300mph and performed a half @entity141 , a partial loop from which you also emerge in a roll , pulling @entity146 , the swiftness and sharpness of the @entity6 ’s manoeuvrability giving some small clue to her prowess in battle			0
now you can win your own flight in a @entity6 , which could just about be the best @entity92 present any @entity93 might receive for next year – the 75th anniversary of the @entity15			1
the little plane , which saved so very many lives , gave me the ride of mine			0
here 's your chance to win a once - in - a - lifetime flight in a @entity9 , the most beautiful and iconic aircraft in @entity164 history			1
