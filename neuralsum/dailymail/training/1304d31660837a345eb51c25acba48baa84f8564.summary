@entity0 is the new favourite to land the @entity3 job after jumping to the top of chairman @entity6 ’s shortlist			1
the former @entity8 manager will renew talks with the @entity11 club on saturday and looks set to beat off a number of stellar candidates , including @entity14 , to the post			2
currently propping up the @entity17 second tier after winning just one league game this season , @entity3 have been looking for a new manager since parting company with scot @entity22 last month			1
@entity0 is the new favourite to land the vacant manager 's job at @entity3 @entity0 has been away from football ’s front - line since leaving @entity8 in may after a successful four - year spell			1
he was due to travel to @entity28 this week for talks on the vacant @entity32 post but visa problems meant he and his backroom staff were unable to travel to @entity35			0
whilst a remuneration package of over £ 2million per year was attractive , @entity0 had reservations at moving to the @entity38 in any event in terms of his career development			2
the challenge of firstly securing the @entity44 ’ place in the @entity11 before building for promotion is far more appealing and there ’s every chance he could take the team for the first time at @entity50 next week			0
@entity3 parted company with @entity22 last month after a dismal run of results in the second tier his name is also under consideration at fellow @entity11 strugglers @entity57 but with caretaker manager @entity58 steadying the ship at @entity61 , @entity0 is more likely to become a rival rather than their would - be saviour			1
a former @entity66 player , @entity0 has maintained his links with the north - west of @entity17 and would relish the chance to write the next chapter of his managerial career there			0
his four years in the @entity8 hot - seat brought three successive league titles , two @entity74 and qualification for the last 16 of the @entity76 .			0
