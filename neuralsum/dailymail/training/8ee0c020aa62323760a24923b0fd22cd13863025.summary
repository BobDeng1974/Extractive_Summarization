and it has seen plenty of it , especially the sudden death of @entity66 ’s @entity65 lover , the diplomat @entity67			1
but in real life the bedroom would also be the scene of the most mundane tasks : a maid would tiptoe in at dawn to light the fire and , if necessary , remove the chamber pot. this was menial work , but there was no shame in it			1
in 1912 , the year in which @entity6 ’s first series was set , 1.3 million people worked in domestic service , compared to 1.2 million on the land and 970,000 in the mines			1

that is why kitchens were located in the basement of great houses			0
the dining room would have been the only room in the main house where the smell of food was welcomed - that is why the kitchen is located in the basement scene of perhaps the most heartwrenching episode when @entity188 ’s youngest daughter dies following the birth of her baby			1
in the early part of the 20th century about 5 per cent of births resulted in the mother ’s death			0
that was equally true for the aristocracy and the working - class , and the death rate did not start to fall until antibiotics arrived in the @entity200			1
where the middle @entity202 daughter prepares for her wedding to sir @entity204 , only to be jilted			0
finding a husband was tough after the carnage of @entity42 : two million women would stay spinsters			0
it was not unusual for stately homes such as @entity101 to have 30 guests at a time			0
this particular room was where the body of the diplomat @entity67 was taken after he had died in @entity66 ’s arms in her bedroom			1
in the centre of this sunny room , there is a freestanding white bath — with no plumbing or taps			1
buckets of hot water would be brought from the kitchens			0
a countess such as @entity89 would not bathe alone : her lady ’s maid would be in attendance			1
this photograph shows @entity89 in her bathroom , adjoining the marital bedroom , with a free - standing bath - which has no plumbing or taps the bedroom of @entity238 the thieving footman , at the end of the servants ’ corridor , is typical of a servant ’s sleeping quarters			1
with its single window and iron bed , it is almost as bare as a prison cell and would have been ice - cold in winter			2
there is an armchair , a bedside table with a lamp , a washstand and a faded woollen rug on the worn floorboards			0
while the family is at dinner , the maids will lay out the nightclothes			0
a copper pan would be filled with hot coals and , with its lid shut , slid between the sheets to make sure they are warm and dry			0
sometimes doubles as his bedroom , for instance when his wife was ill. the @entity49 ’s valet mr @entity271 helps him dress here and would even cut his hair			0
a valet had to do everything			0
has the human touches that the austere pantry lacks			0
here , the @entity101 housekeeper can relax in the plush velvet chair , surrounded by photos of her family and nick - nacks			2
it is from a high - backed leather chair behind a desk that the butler dispenses wisdom and justice among his staff			2
in real life , a butler was the only servant allowed to answer the front door			1
he would earn £ 60 a year ( £ 6,000 today )			0

the footmen ’s cubby hole , with its own set of bells			0
