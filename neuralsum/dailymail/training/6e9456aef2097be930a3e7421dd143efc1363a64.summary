by @entity0 published : 11:34 est , 13 june 2013 updated : 11:37 est , 13 june 2013 women from the north of @entity4 are more likely to be diagnosed with the deadliest form of skin cancer than their southern counterparts because of sunbeds and cheap holidays abroad , a study has found			1
rates of melanoma - the most lethal form of cancer - had previously been highest in affluent areas of the south where the hours of sunshine are longer , according to research published today in the @entity19			1
but cases in women aged between 10 and 29 have drastically risen in the north west of the country - with experts blaming young women 's overuse of sunbeds to try and look like their favourite celebrities			1
hidden danger : cases of melanoma have become most prevalent in young women , aged between 10 and 29 , who are living in the north west of @entity4 because of sunbed use and cheap holidays ( stock image ) research leader @entity38 , from the @entity40 's @entity39 , says the findings suggest that affordability of holidays to warmer climates has been important factor in changing the regional discrepancy in melanoma rates			1
the study examined diagnoses of melanoma over eleven years from 1996 to 2006			1
researchers at the @entity40 also found that the disease was found to be most prevalent among the second most deprived socioeconomic group as well as the second most affluent groups			0
@entity55 , of the @entity56 , said : ' this study is interesting as it changes our views on two important risk factors for skin cancer – where we live and how rich we are			0
' @entity63 position in @entity4 has long been associated with risk levels for skin cancer , with southern regions always having the highest rates of the disease			1
but for young women , the disease is now highest in the @entity70			1
' we know that across @entity4 , use of tanning beds is highest among young women in the north and is also high among lower socioeconomic status groups , so this may well be a strong contributing factor to both these findings			1
former @entity81 @entity80 , from @entity82 , pictured left , and @entity84 member @entity83 , from @entity85 , pictured right , have both admitted using sunbeds in the past and campaigned against their use previous figures have always shown melanoma to be more common in affluent people who can afford to fly abroad to warmer countries			1
these new findings suggest that holidays abroad becoming more affordable for everyone has contributed to those with lower incomes being diagnosed with the disease			1
researchers at the @entity100 found that 90 per cent of sunbeds in the @entity102 emit radiation that is higher than the safety standards set by the @entity105			1
the @entity106 has stated that sunbeds are as lethal as cigarettes and they are listed as one of the most dangerous , cancer - causing habits			1
cases of malignant melanoma - the deadliest skin cancer - have doubled in the last decade , according to figures from @entity115			1
around 13,000 @entity102 are diagnosed with the illness each year and it causes 2,800 deaths			0
research has previously found that a using a sunbed before the age of 35 increases the risk of malignant melanoma by nearly 90 per cent			1
under pressure : @entity83 , pictured far right with her @entity84 bandmates in 2004 , said she became obsessed with having a tan former @entity81 star @entity80 , from @entity82 , is just one of many celebrities who has admitted to using sunbeds - which significantly increase the risk of melanoma - and since spoken out about the shocking impact it 's had on her skin			1
the 32 - year - old gave up using sunbeds ten years ago , now opting for fake tan , but by then a lot of damage had already been done			2
ultraviolet images taken of the singer 's skin showed uv damage beneath the surface of her skin with experts warning she will suffer from liver spots in years to come because of tanning sessions in her youth			2
after viewing the image , ms @entity80 told @entity152 : ' i ’m worried much of the damage has already been done — the picture looks like an old woman			0
' there are so many freckles you ca n’t see			0
i had already noticed a change in the pigmentation on my hairline			0
' apart from the risk of skin cancer when i look at that picture i ’m just thinking , " i do n’t want to look like that old woman "			0
' @entity84 singer @entity83 , from @entity85 , has also previously admitted to being a ' tanorexic '			2
she mainly used fake tan but admits she tried sunbeds - only giving them up as they gave her more freckles			2
self - confessed former tanorexic : @entity83 , pictured with computer generated skin damage ahead of a tv show @entity175 , has called for sunbeds to be banned for under 18s the singer , who spearheaded a campaign to ban sunbeds for those under 18 , told @entity152 : ' i was obsessed			2
if i did n’t have fake tan on i felt like death warmed up			0
the rest of the girls were lovely and bronzed			0
' i used them [ sunbeds ] a couple of times but it would just burn me and give me freckles			2
' thank @entity192 it did n’t make me go golden brown			0
i dread to think of the position i ’d be in now			0
' it comes after a survey carried out by @entity115 earlier this year revealed that 45 per cent of 18 to 34 - year - olds who use sunbeds are unhappy with their bodies			2
the study also revealed that 30 per cent of people who use sunbeds do so to look more attractive			2
eight out of every ten of these unhappy sunbed users claim that they feel pressurised to look different – 29 per cent said they were influenced most by peer pressure , 30 per cent said they were influenced by celebrities , and 45 per cent said it was the media that made them feel pressurised to look tanned			2
by contrast , the research revealed that only 36 per cent of young people who have never used a sunbed are unhappy with their appearance			0
silent killer : the @entity106 says that sunbeds - one of leading causes of melanoma , pictured - are as lethal as cigarettes and they are listed as one of the most dangerous , cancer - causing habits @entity225 , senior health campaigns manager at @entity115 , said : ‘ we live in an image - obsessed culture and know many sunbed users continue to use them because they think they look better with a tan			1
‘ but actually they are making their skin look worse in the long run			0
the more unhappy they are with the skin they ’re in , the more they may use sunbeds – it ’s a vicious circle			0
‘ sunbeds can result in premature ageing and wrinkles , as well as increased pigmentation on the skin			0
‘ no one wants to look older before their time , and crucially , using sunbeds also increases the risk of skin cancer			0
’ other recent research found that a ten minute session on a sunbed is twice as likely to cause skin cancer as spending the same amount of time in the midday sun in the @entity258 .			0

rates of melanoma had previously been highest in the south of @entity4
but cases in women ages between 10 and 29 have drastically risen in north
experts say that aside from sunbeds , cheap holidays abroad are to blame
