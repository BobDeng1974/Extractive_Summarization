' mr @entity7 ' petition reads : ' as a father of two young children , i 've always appreciated the idea behind @entity2 's @entity1 campaign , and the brand 's understanding that the way women and girls are portrayed , both literally ( through words ) and visually ( in pictures ) , has a big impact on how they view themselves and who they aspire to be			1
