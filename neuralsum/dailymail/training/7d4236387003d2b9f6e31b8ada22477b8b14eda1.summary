by @entity0 we bargain - hunting brits are happy to scrimp on staycations and budget for our weekly shop - but when it comes to weddings , we are less skilful at saving our pennies			0
according to a new study , the average @entity9 spends an eye - watering £ 440 for every wedding we attend - that amounts to an entire week 's salary every time someone ties the knot			1
and with most of us attending five weddings per year , our matrimonial attendance is costing us a total of £ 2,180 every year			0
hey big spender : the average @entity9 spends a whole week 's wages being a wedding guest and most attend five a year , which tots up to £ 2,180 ! not surprisingly , the @entity26 women surveyed saw their outfit as being the most important part of being a wedding guest			1
with so many cameras flashing and potential @entity33 tags awaiting , it comes as no surprise that a staggering 70 per cent of women choose to spend more on their outfit than they do on their accommodation			1
accommodation came in second place when it came to costs , with 61 per cent shelling out over £ 150 for an evening of celebration			2

' the cost of weddings is always considered from the perspective of the bride and groom , but just how much does it cost the guests and where do they see the need to spend money to ensure they are the very best wedding guest			2
