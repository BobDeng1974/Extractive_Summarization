@entity1 news agency claims @entity2 was killed by his best friend @entity3 says handwriting specialist determined that @entity2 did not begin to write his suicide note , but that his friend may have done @entity3 was the last person to see @entity2 alive on the day of his death the man who took @entity9 from a @entity11 street when she was just a schoolgirl and kept her captive for nearly nine years in a secret dungeon - may have been murdered , it was claimed today			1
police always said @entity2 ended his own life by lying with his head a railway line when an express train came along in the hours after @entity9 escaped his clutches in august 2006			2
but a @entity1 news organisation now claims his decapitated body was ' almost intact ' after it was found by police - despite a grille at the front of the train that should have seriously mangled his body - and that his former best friend @entity3 was suspected of being behind the death			1
new revelations : a @entity1 news organisation now claims that @entity3 ( left ) was behind the train death of kidnapper @entity32 traumatic : @entity9 was snatched from a @entity11 street when she was just a schoolgirl and held by @entity2 for nearly nine years the 20 minute @entity35 prints details of handwriting analysed by officials in @entity39 of @entity2 and @entity3 and determined that @entity2 did not begin to write his suicide note - but that his friend may have done			1
a 2009 expert report stated ; ' the comparison of the questionable word ' mummy ' with the available specimens of handwriting of @entity3 furnished individual graphic similarities			1
' @entity3 knew of @entity9 and often met with her when @entity2 brought her along to flats that the pair of them refurbished in @entity11 for profit			1
he later told police he thought she was a girlfriend of his			0
doubts rasied : the grave of @entity55 , the man who abducted @entity9 , but there are questions of his death @entity3 was the last person to see @entity2 alive on the day of his death - august 23 2006			1
they met at a shopping centre on the outskirts of the @entity39 capital where , according to @entity3 , his friend was distressed at @entity9 's escape and the massive police hunt underway for him			2
the former president of the highest court in @entity11 , @entity66 , who served on a special @entity39 commission analysing police failings into the @entity9 investigation , called the suicide note ' an extremely mysterious piece of evidence which questions the suicide thesis			1
' he added ; ' doubts about the suicide theory are legitimate			2
i personally have them too			0
@entity3 's version that @entity2 began to write to his mother and stopped after the word mummy is completely implausible to me			1
' a 40 - year - old man who wants to say good - bye to his mother writes at least or two sentences , in which he can say ' i am done with suffering ' or ' thanks for everything ' or something in this direction			0
' he also questioned why the corpse of @entity2 - cremated soon afterwards - did not have its temperature taken at the time of death , or have blood removed from it , both of which are standard procedures at crime scenes			2
back in 2009 the @entity9 case chief investigator @entity98 said that the death looked ' staged			0
' house of horror : the house in @entity102 , where kidnapped @entity9 was held captive captive : the entrance and stairway to the cellar where @entity9 spent so much of her life his brother @entity108 told the @entity1 news organisation ; ' i believe @entity3 had to get rid of the second culprit him because of things he might have said			1
my brother said that people who kill themselves do not put their heads on railway lines			0
' long suspected of being an accomplice in the kidnapping , @entity3 was officially ruled out of assisting in her abduction and captivity by @entity39 authorities in 2010			2
his lawyers said he refused to comment about the new allegations swirling around him			0
the @entity9 case and its aftermath constitute the greatest police and judicial scandal in @entity39 criminal history			0
a probe in 2006 found that there had been ‘ massive ’ police blunders and failures on the part of detectives which could have seen the girl rescued in the first few weeks after she disappeared			0
the police investigation was flawed from the start , and many people felt that because she was an only child being being brought up on a sink estate outside @entity11 , she had been forgotten by the authorities			0
since she gained her freedom she has written a book about her ordeal , become rich from media interviews and now spends weekends at the house where she was incarcerated .			0
