by @entity0 they were intended to be ‘ @entity2 ’ – explosive interviews with former @entity5 terrorists revealing some of their most notorious crimes			1
the interviews , recorded for a history project , were granted only under strict condition that they were not released until after the deaths of all concerned			1
but after a fierce legal battle , the secret interviews were passed to the police in @entity14 – and the bombshell revelations contained on the tapes are thought to be a key factor behind the dramatic arrest and questioning of @entity19 at a police station in @entity21 yesterday			1
former friends : @entity19 ( left ) is pictured in @entity24 prison with @entity25 , a former deputy commander of the @entity5 's @entity26			1
@entity25 said @entity27 was killed on @entity19 ' orders murdered : at least two high - profile @entity5 operatives have linked the @entity31 leader ( right ) to the murder of @entity27 ( left ) , the mother of ten who was brutally abducted , executed and secretly buried in december 1972 at least two high - profile @entity5 operatives have linked the @entity31 leader to the murder of @entity27 , the mother of ten who was brutally abducted , executed and secretly buried in december 1972			1
the former @entity5 terrorists who claim they served alongside @entity19 say he ordered the killing			1
@entity19 has repeated and categorically denied involvement in the death or the @entity5 policy of ‘ @entity40 ’ – men and women in @entity14 suspected of being informers of the @entity44 who were taken from the streets , questioned , shot and buried			1
but the tapes and subsequent interviews allege a very different story in a detailed series of claims which were yesterday being put to the 65 - year - old politician and architect of the @entity53			2
denial : @entity19 has repeatedly denied involvement in @entity27 's death or the @entity5 policy of ' @entity40 ' grieving : @entity27 's family members carry flowers and a photo of their mother following her death they include two damning accounts – one of which was given by ex-hunger striker @entity65 , a former deputy commander of the @entity5 ’s @entity26			1
@entity25 , who died in 2008 , said @entity27 was killed on @entity19 ’ orders			1
‘ there was only one man who gave the order for that woman to be executed			2
that man is now the head of @entity31 , ’ he said			2
‘ i did not give the order to execute that woman			0
i knew she was being executed			0
i did n’t know she was going to be buried or disappeared as they called them now			0
‘ the special squad was brought into the operation then called the @entity80 , you know , when anyone needed to be taken away , they normally done it			0
i had no control over this squad			0
@entity19 had control over this particular squad			2
’ search : @entity91 police excavate the beach in @entity93 , @entity14 , where the body of @entity27 was found in 2003 removing her body : the mother of ten 's body is removed from an area near @entity102 beach in @entity93 funeral : the family of @entity27 carry her coffin into church - 31 years after she was abducted and murdered the other damning account is that of @entity108 , the first woman to become a member of an @entity5 active service unit and the leader of the terror cell which bombed the @entity113 in 1973			1
@entity108 , who died last year , recounted how she was chosen to be part of a small select unit within the three battalions that made up the @entity26			0
the group of eight hand - picked volunteers , labelled ‘ the @entity80 ’ , were responsible for ‘ special operations , including internal investigations to weed out informers ’			0
‘ the hardest thing i ever did was drive those people away , the @entity124 , ’ @entity108 said			0
‘ i never knew for sure their ultimate end , i was simply told by @entity19 to take the people away , a couple of lads or whatever			2
past : a younger @entity19 ( centre ) attends the funeral of an @entity5 member who was killed while planting a bomb interview : @entity19 remained in police custody here in @entity21 , where he has been in custody since wednesday ' it was part of my job within the “ unknowns ” to take them across the border to hand them over to others			1
i do n’t even remember some of the names , is n’t that terrible ? ’ @entity108 ’s interview continued : ‘ i drove away @entity27 , a very , very unpleasant woman			2
‘ i know i should n’t speak ill of the dead and i do n’t think she deserved to die and , at the time , i did n’t know she had children			0
damning : @entity108 , the first woman to become a member of an @entity5 active service unit , was the other operative to give a damning account ‘ i had a call one night and @entity19 was in a house down the @entity158 and she ’d ( @entity27 ) been arrested by @entity159 ( a female wing of the @entity5 ) women and held for a couple of days			1
she got into my car and as far as she was concerned she was being taken away by the @entity164 to a place of safety			0
‘ it was unfortunate for her and it was unfortunate for me as well because she was a foul - mouthed woman who cursed and swore a lot all the way down to the border			0
she went on and on about “ them provies , they would n’t have the balls to shoot me ... i do n’t care what i did ”			0
i was saying to myself , “ please do n’t say any more ” , but she went on and on – she convicted herself out of her own mouth			0
it was n’t my decision to disappear her , thank @entity182			0
‘ you do n’t deserve to die if you are an unpleasant person , as she was , but you do deserve to die if you are an informer , i do believe that			0
particularly in a war , that is the @entity187 way			0
’ like @entity25 , @entity108 provided her personal account of her time in the @entity5 to be part of the @entity191 history project and in subsequent interviews			1
researchers at @entity191 last year lost a @entity195 challenge in the @entity196 when they tried to block the release of the 84 tapes after the @entity199 launched a high - profile legal challenge			2
so far , 11 have been handed over relating to the @entity27 case			2
the wild card in any prosecutions could be a former @entity5 man called @entity205 , 77 , who had a bitter split with @entity19 in the mid- 1980s			1
@entity205 ’s interviews , if accepted as admissible evidence , could be used against @entity19 because @entity205 is still alive			1
@entity205 was charged in march with aiding and abetting in the murder of @entity27 , which he denies			1

interviews not supposed to be released until after deaths of all concerned
