a brief guide to @entity1 by @entity2 for years i ’d thought it was @entity6 ’s we ’ll meet again they planned to broadcast when the atomic bombs fell , but according to @entity2 , in this essential guide to the iconic film , when a nuclear strike is imminent , the @entity10 intends filling the airwaves with songs from @entity1			1
cynical sorts will argue that having to listen to @entity17 and @entity18 will only make them incredibly impatient for oblivion			2
nevertheless the remaining powers - that - be sincerely hope to ‘ maintain some semblance of normality ’ by exposing us to the ever - optimistic @entity23			1
it has always been easy to sneer at ‘ three hours of nuns yodelling ’ , and @entity26 himself dubbed the picture @entity29			2
but i for one love it , perhaps because 50 years back my grandmother took me to see it six times at the @entity34 in @entity35			2
@entity1 could have been very different if the @entity36 had claimed a place in the film i always hid under the seat when the @entity40 prowled around the convent , and to this day i have n’t seen the bit where the nuns sabotage the cars			1
it was a film that appealed to women who had domineering husbands — all those glowering captain @entity48 sorts who expected their dinner to be on the table			1
my grandmother , and millions like her , would love to have been @entity53 , cutting up the curtains to make clothes , falling in lakes for fun , rebelliously cycling around the countryside , picnicking and generally being heedless of chores and domestic obligations			2
in its unlikely and unstrident way , @entity1 was a pioneering feminist rallying cry , and ordinary women , who ’d have had no earthly inkling what @entity66 was rabbiting on about , embraced it and identified with it			2
the first surprise in @entity70 ’s book is that the story begins in @entity72			1
the @entity23 were descended from @entity73 , an engineer born in @entity74 in 1823			1
he went abroad to work for a @entity76 company and in @entity77 , then part of the @entity79 , he built ‘ the first cylindrical marine boiler ’ and helped design armour - plated frigates for @entity83 ’s navy			2
@entity73 ’s granddaughter , @entity85 , met captain @entity86 when he was visiting the factory looking at torpedoes			1
@entity53 ( centre ) is pictured in 1965 on the set of @entity1 with her on - screen step - children they were married in 1911 and had seven children			1
@entity85 died of scarlet fever in 1922 , and @entity86 moved as a widower to @entity97			1
a 21 - year - old nun came to help out with the family — @entity100			2
she ’d entered the convent , @entity102 , to escape abusive uncles and cousins			2
exactly as in the film , she was a tomboyish postulant , always having to be rebuked for sliding down banisters , climbing on the roof , jumping over chimneys , and grabbing the other nuns to tickle their ribs			1
@entity86 was entranced , and he married his new nanny in 1927			1
but how much of a mutual love - match was it ? @entity100 ‘ suggested to @entity86 that he go on the honeymoon without her ’			2
at least they could make music			2
like @entity26 , @entity86 peeped on a bosun ’s whistle to call the children to order , and he accompanied them on a guitar when they had a singing session			1
by the way , @entity125 sincerely believed that @entity127 was the official national anthem of @entity129			2
after they ’d sung a selection of medieval church music at the @entity133 in 1936 , the @entity23 were invited abroad on tours			1
they sang before @entity136 in @entity137 and entertained the @entity138 at the @entity139			0
it is here that the movie differs from reality			0
in real life the family left by train for a series of engagements , crossing the @entity148 and taking a ship from @entity150 for @entity151 , arriving in @entity152 in october 1938			0
though @entity86 had been reprimanded by the @entity154 for failing to fly the @entity156 flag after the @entity157 , there was no actual immediate danger			0
the five eldest @entity36 ( pictured in 1972 ) are said to have begged to be able to play the @entity48 children in the famous film according to @entity161 , however , the @entity23 crept from the concert hall , hid behind the @entity164 tombs , and climbed every mountain to freedom carrying heavy instrument cases			1
in fact , had @entity53 , @entity26 and the children kept going on the route they ’d chosen , they ’d have soon arrived on the terrace in @entity175 ’s @entity174 part of @entity129 borders @entity176 , not @entity177			1
and may i also state for the record that there is no such dish as ‘ @entity182 ’			0
the closest you ’d find is ‘ @entity184 ’			0
the original @entity100 was diddled by agents and managers , who persuaded her to sell them the global rights to her story in perpetuity for a paltry flat fee of $ 10,000 , so neither she nor the family made a further penny cent from any of the adaptations			1
@entity194 did n’t even invite @entity100 to the premiere , in case she ‘ eclipsed ’ @entity53			0
i was shocked to discover that many major talents had shunned the chance to put the proven hit on the big screen			0
neither @entity200 nor @entity201 would touch it , as ‘ no musical with swastikas in it can be a success ’			0
@entity205 , @entity206 and @entity207 turned down the role of captain @entity48 , believing the man to be ‘ very much a cardboard figure , humourless and one - dimensional ’			1
@entity212 , @entity213 and @entity214 did n’t fancy donning a wimple			0
@entity212 ( left ) is said to have turned down the role of @entity100 , while @entity206 ( right ) rejected the part of captain @entity48 , believing it to be ' a cardboard figure ' @entity219 rejected the part of @entity221 , the impresario — a shame			1
he ’d have been brilliant			0
by contrast , the five eldest @entity36 begged to play the @entity48 children			1
they were rejected , thank @entity226 , though @entity227 was to strum a guitar and play @entity100 on stage in the @entity230			0
of those @entity233 - looking youngsters who were finally cast , after their 11 weeks on location in @entity97 and the glorious @entity235 in 1964 , none was to go on to great things			0
in late middle age by now , they are variously software designers , flower arrangers , nurses or interior decorators			0
regarding the authentic @entity23 , incidentally , they stopped singing professionally in 1956 and settled in @entity241 , where they ran a hotel that burned down in 1980			1
@entity100 died in 1987 , @entity86 having long predeceased her , in 1947			1
life was never as rosy as in the film : one of the children had electroconvulsive shock treatment for depression , another married a @entity251 , and others became dairy farmers			1
to date there have been 116 cast albums from the innumerable stage productions of @entity1			0
( the @entity258 version lasted from 2006 until 2011			0
) @entity260 parties are wildly popular , with the audience in costume — i ’d go myself but in a nun outfit i do keep being mistaken for @entity265 as @entity266			0
@entity53 ( left ) and @entity26 ( right ) won the two top roles in the famous film , playing @entity100 and captain @entity48 respectively the @entity53 film is the third highest grossing movie in history , behind @entity273 and @entity274			1
( pre-tax profits of $ 20 million by 1966 saved @entity194 from the near - bankruptcy it faced after the @entity278 / @entity277			0
) dvd and blu - ray sales remain buoyant , with an ever - burgeoning number of special features and documentaries			0
the only place where it has never caught on , ironically , is @entity129 , where captain @entity48 is considered a deserter , which he was if you think about it			1
the @entity48 villa became @entity292 ’s headquarters during the war			1
the film was also heavily edited in @entity295 , where it was felt that nuns should n’t be seen singing non-religious songs			2
for the rest of us , it is more than a movie			0
@entity1 is intimately bound up with childhood memories and emotions , in my case going to @entity35 for all those mid-week matinees , escaping the @entity308 coal dust for the pristine @entity129 panoramas			0
indeed , years later i bought a flat near @entity97			0
i ’ve done my best to live where the hills are alive — though in actuality they are not these days alive with @entity314			0
what you hear are oompah - bands and men in lederhosen slapping their thighs and playing @entity321 by blowing down the tube of a milking machine			0
once seen , never forgotten			0
by the way , do get the latest incarnation of the dvd , as it includes an all - new documentary : @entity53 returns to @entity97			0
you see , she was n’t able to leave the film behind either .			2

the @entity23 were descended from an engineer from @entity74
@entity85 and captain @entity48 married in 1911 and had seven children
