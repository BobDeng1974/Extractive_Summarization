more veterans are set to storm the barricades of @entity3 's shuttered national monuments today in protest at the government shutdown after @entity6 refused to fund the healthcare act			1
former servicemen are plotting to occupy the capital 's closed @entity10 for a second day , and also broaden their protests to other sites including the @entity13			1
the planned acts of civil disobedience by defiant veterans in their 80s and 90s threatens to fan the flames of an already fierce fight over who is responsible for denying the federal government the funds to operate			1
next objective : @entity3 's @entity13 , which has also been closed by the government shutdown , could be next on the list of veterans ' targets as they seek to broaden their protest against the political deadlock beyond boundaries : veterans from @entity34 were able to tour the @entity35 in @entity3 on tuesday after removing the fences closing the site due to the @entity39 government shutdown defiant : veterans on an @entity42 tour visit the @entity35 in @entity3 even the the site was officially closed because of the government shutdown the @entity46 's memorial to the @entity39 's @entity47 dead became a political battlefield yesterday when a group of 91 former servicemen who had travelled from @entity51 ' stormed ' its barricades			1
they were among hundreds who had arrived for a planned visit to the memorial morning to find it shuttered by the @entity59 after the shutdown went into effect at midnight			2
and they were quickly joined by conservative politicians who accused @entity64 of being to blame for the monument 's closure			2
there could be a repeat of those scenes today when more groups from the @entity42 - a non-profit group that arranges free visits to the @entity72 for veterans - arrive in @entity3 to visit the monument			1
one @entity42 volunteer said they were considering staging further protests elsewhere			0
@entity78 , a five - year veteran of the @entity79 , told @entity80 : ' we are thinking about jumping the @entity13 too			1
if @entity83 was a war memorial i would do it in a heart beat			0
' @entity88 veteran @entity87 , left , and his escort , @entity86 display a piece of police tape removed from the @entity92 yesterday members of @entity6 , including @entity94			1
@entity95 of @entity96 , and @entity97 , of @entity51 , rushed to @entity10 and cut police tape to let in the veterans			1
' i find it disappointing and disgusting for our country to have to go through this , ' said @entity104 , 90 , of @entity105 , @entity51 to the @entity106			0
mr @entity104 survived a plane crash and climbed the @entity108 to post a radio transmitter on top as a member of the @entity112 during the @entity47			0
' i feel like we deserve better , ' @entity104 said			0
' somewhere , somehow , somebody screwed up			0
' @entity115 , of @entity116 , @entity51 was one of five brothers who fought in @entity47 , said the memorial ’s closure ' hurt us			0
' ' i crossed the @entity122 20 times on convoy duty , ' said mr @entity115 , 87 , to the @entity106			0
' i ended up in @entity124 for the signing of the surrender			0
' ' we did our share , and the last thing people should do is not let us in and not let people open the gate			0
' ' we took on the @entity133 and the @entity134 and we whipped them , and then we have to take this sort of thing ? it makes you wonder if these people work for the @entity39 government or for themselves			2
' greatest generation : rep. @entity143 , of @entity34 ( bottom center ) , helped distract @entity59 officers to allow veterans to enter the memorial call of duty : rep. @entity143 is pictured with one of the veterans who traveled from @entity34 to pay respects to their fallen comrades meet and greet : @entity39 representative @entity95 ( left ) said she and her colleagues plan to continue coming down to the memorial every day to ensure veterans ' access to the site tour : a group of 91 veterans from @entity51 were flown down to @entity3 by a charity group to visit the memorial @entity95 said it was ‘ pure joy ’ when members of the greatest generation were allowed in because they had traveled so far to honor their fallen comrades			1
she added that her fellow congressmen and women plan to continue coming down to the memorial every day while the shutdown continues to ensure veterans ’ access			2
‘ @entity39 is not shutting down , ’ she told @entity174			0
‘ if we have anything to say about it , we 're going to keep this open			0
’ park spokeswoman @entity178 said the service did n't want to keep veterans out , but the agency was directed to close all memorials after the @entity6 failed to approve a budget resolution , leading to the first government shutdown in 17 years			1
tough guys : many of the veterans at the site were wheelchair - bound or relying on walking canes to get around on the fence : @entity39 @entity191 close off the @entity35 in @entity3 after the first government shutdown in 17 years went into effect a long - running dispute between @entity64 and @entity194 over president @entity196 's @entity195 stalled a temporary funding bill , forcing about 800,000 federal workers off the job and suspending most non-essential federal programs and services			1
‘ we ’re looking about how to deal with this in the future , ’ @entity178 said			0
@entity205 , a reporter for the newspaper @entity206 who was present at the memorial , tweeted that he witnessed rep @entity143 , of @entity34 , distracting a @entity59 officer while veterans knocked down the barricades			1
members of @entity214 - a nonprofit group that arranges free visits to the @entity72 for veterans - made their way to the capital visit the memorial			2
@entity220 , a spokesman for the organization , said they had planned the visit long before the shutdown and could not cancel the pilgrimage			0
keeping history locked up : one of the clearest examples of the effect of the shutdown comes from the closure of all @entity229 close as you can get : a last minute effort by @entity194 to reopen the @entity229 failed on tuesday evening , thought it was viewed by many as a stopgap to lessen the backlash against the @entity194 @entity235 : a cyclist had to cut his ride short on tuesday in @entity238 in @entity239 , @entity240 the 91 veterans , many of them wheelchair - bound or using walking canes to get around , arrived at @entity244 in an $ 80,000 chartered plane on tuesday morning			1
they boarded buses and arrived at the memorial at around 11.30am , only to discover metal fences around the site and printed signs announcing that the memorial has been closed due to the government shutdown			1
even though park police officers were patrolling the area , they made no attempts to stop the veterans and congressmen who came to their aid from moving the barriers and entering the site			2
‘ i thought i was going to have to stand back when we first got here , ’ veteran @entity262 told @entity263			0
‘ i feel extremely lucky			0
this is really nice , a great honor			0
’ fighting back : protestors demonstrated by the @entity268 demanding the @entity269 pass a @entity270 without any amendments that attempted to defund the @entity195 defending themselves : republicans , lead by senator @entity274 at the podium , called for @entity64 to compromise and allow them to pass a version of a budget to end the shutdown sticking on message : @entity64 house minority leader @entity281 pushed for @entity39 to enroll in the national healthcare system that was launched today the gray - haired and stooped visitors were able to lay a wreath at the @entity51 pillar and take pictures before leaving the site less than an hour later			1
besides the travelers from @entity51 , a group of veterans from @entity34 dressed in bright yellow shirts were also allowed to access the memorial			2
at the @entity298 , a group of veterans from @entity297 also stormed the barricades to lay a wreath , the @entity294 reported			1
major hurdles : park rangers erect barricades as a visitor is turned away from a section of @entity306 in @entity307 march : furloughed federal employes march in front of a shuttered @entity310 at @entity306 in @entity307 blockade : a barrier blocks the @entity313 in @entity3 as national parks were closed due the budget battle rep. @entity316 , of @entity317 , called the veterans ’ bold actions ‘ the best civil disobedience we 've seen in @entity3 in a while , ’ according to @entity322			1
the veterans ’ decision to ignore the shutdown and move fences aside in order to pay their respects to military heroes has drawn bipartisan support from members of the @entity269 and @entity333 alike			2
@entity64 sen. @entity334 , of @entity335 , posted on @entity336 that he would be donating his pay during the shutdown to the @entity42 organization in his home state , while @entity194 sen. @entity341 , of @entity240 , simply tweeted , ‘ good for them			0
