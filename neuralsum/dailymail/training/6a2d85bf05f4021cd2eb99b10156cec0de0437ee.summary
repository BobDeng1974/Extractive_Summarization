one of the world ’s rarest orchids has been discovered by @entity3 botanists on a volcanic island in the @entity5			2
professor @entity9 and dr @entity10 , experts from the @entity7 at @entity8 , found the green - flowered plant on a wind - swept mountain ridge they compared to a scene from sir @entity15 ’s @entity14			1
there were only 250 plants of the unique species on the island of @entity20 in the @entity22 @entity21 , making the newly named @entity23 the rarest in @entity24			1
rare : this shows details of the flowers of @entity30 's butterfly - orchid , a newly recognized and exceptionally rare orchid recently discovered incredibly , on their return to @entity3 the scientists realised that another botanist had first seen the orchid 175 years ago - but had never realised what he had discovered			0
browsing the library at @entity7 , they realised that a @entity38 explorer , 20 - year - old @entity30 , found the plant when he visited the @entity21 , 850 miles off the @entity22 coast , in 1838			1
professor @entity9 said : ‘ @entity30 collected just one specimen and dried it			1
‘ he gave it to his father , the world - renowned botanist @entity45 , who totally misunderstood both the specimen and what its significance was			0
’ @entity51 confused the orchid with a closely related species , accurately drawing the plant in his 1844 book on the islands but mislabelling it			2
professor @entity9 added : ‘ he confused specimens			1
the real problem was that the father , a very experienced botanist , never visited the island			2
‘ he never saw these plants living - he just saw a squashed specimen			0
‘ he messed up completely in describing this orchid and it disappeared from everyone ’s view for the last 170 - odd years			0
’ the botanist added : ‘ this remarkable species languished unrecognised for all that time			0
’ the @entity3 botanists and their @entity21 - based colleague @entity69 , who have published their work in the journal @entity74 , debated whether to publicise the discovery at all			0
‘ one concern was that plant collectors would seek this orchid out and even dig it out , ’ said professor @entity9			1
‘ but we decided there was a real need to make people aware of this so conservation work can be carried out			0
’ orchid : each plant could be worth a substantial sum to collectors			1
tropical orchids pictured here at @entity7 , @entity89 each plant - although not as colourful or vivid as tropical orchids - could be worth a substantial sum to collectors			1
but prof @entity9 warned that the plant would be unlikely to survive outside its natural @entity96 plant - which has been given the formal @entity98 name of @entity100 - only lives in two volcanic craters a mile apart on a windy ridge			1
the team found it only grows in a narrow band between the altitudes of 950m and 1,000m			0
‘ it likes wet , acid soil and a very humid climate , ’ prof @entity9 said			2
‘ it is very exposed up there on that ridge and the wind really whistles through			0
you would have to really know what you were doing to recreate those conditions			0

professor @entity9 and dr @entity10 found the plant
there were only 250 plants of the unique species on island
each plant could be worth a substantial sum to collectors
