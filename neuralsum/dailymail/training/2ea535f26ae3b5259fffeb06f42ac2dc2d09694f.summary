as the @entity2 war machine tore through @entity3 , there was still one way @entity5 could give @entity6 the needle back home ... thanks to a novelty pin cushion			1
with his hands between his knees and bent forward , this 4.5in high figurine from the early 1940s saw the @entity18 's buttocks covered in a brown tufted fabric - a perfect place to ' stick it ' to his @entity21			2
and president @entity22 is said to have found it so funny that he had one on his desk , according to @entity26 's @entity27			0
this novelty @entity6 pin cushion was sold in the @entity5 during the 1940s for 69 cents some of the figurines come with a comedy tag - and the novelties can sell for over $ 430 the blurb from @entity26 's @entity33 from 1944 read : ' it 's a safe place to store pins and needles ... and will probably be the only useful thing @entity37 [ his father 's original surname ] did ' the novelty mail order company 's blurb reads : ' it 's a safe place to store pins and needles ... and will probably be the only useful thing @entity37 [ his father 's original surname ] did			1
' during the war , they could be bought for 69 cents , from @entity48 - or $ 1.49 from the @entity49 - but some are now worth hundreds of dollars			0
an increasing number of the cushions have gone to auction in recent years as cash - strapped owners seem more willing to part with their memorabilia as the @entity5 economy languishes in the doldrums			0
one of them , from 1941 , sold for $ 430 ( Â£ 275 ) in 2006 at @entity59 's @entity58 in @entity60 , @entity61			1
and another is for sale on @entity63 , where the bidding currently stands at $ 48			0
the @entity49 also sold the statues , for a slightly pricier $ 1.49 this miserable - looking @entity18 statue from the war had a huge red cushion on his behind , rather than the brown tufted version some of the figurines , fixed to a 1.5in base , come with a copy of the @entity75 tag which reads : ' it is good luck to find a pin , here 's an axis to stick it in ! ' and just to avoid any confusion , it even comes with a warning that it is ' not endorsed by @entity6 ' so it 's not an officially sanctioned product			1
other anti-nazi comedy products sold by @entity48 during the war included @entity6 the @entity87 - ' listen to him holler when coin is inserted ' for 59c ; and @entity6 the @entity90 - ' @entity89 ' which was made of plastic and retailed for 89c			2
the term ' hotzi notzi ' is believed to be a tongue - in - cheek reference to ' hot nazi ' - an attractive person who exhibits racist attitudes .			0
