by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 09:12 est , 9 january 2013 updated : 11:51 est , 9 january 2013 @entity3 pensioners who live abroad could be the first to lose their winter fuel allowance under government plans to save millions of pounds from the welfare bill			1
officials have been ordered to find a way to claw back up to £ 16million paid to people living outside the @entity3 to help with their fuel bills			2
it comes as senior minister @entity12 signalled that the @entity14 pledge to protect universal benefits is likely to be ditched in the next election manifesto			1
ministers want to stop expat pensioners living in hot parts of @entity20 like the @entity21 from claiming help with winter fuel bills work and pensions secretary @entity23 yesterday suggested future generations of pensioners could lose some of their universal benefits like winter fuel allowance , free tv licences and bus passes			1
he has vowed to honour @entity31 ’s pre-election pledge to protect the benefits until 2015 , because pensioners are less able to increase their income than someone in work if benefits are suddenly cut			0
but he suggested that beyond 2015 new pensioners might not enjoy the same perks			0
mr @entity23 is understood to be furious at a @entity41 ruling that will hugely increase the bill for @entity3 who live abroad claiming winter fuel allowance			1
under current rules it can only be claimed by someone who moves overseas after turning 60			0
but the ruling said that anyone could claim it regardless of when they left the @entity3			2
latest figures show that in 2011 - 12 , £ 16million was paid to in winter fuel allowance to people not living in the @entity3			1
today it emerged that officials are considering setting a qualifying threshold based on an average winter temperature , so that people living in @entity3 would qualify even if there was a mild spell			1
‘ clearly it is a crazy idea that pensioners living in hot places abroad in @entity20 should be receiving winter fuel payments , ’ a source said			1
‘ we are looking into seeing if there is something we can do around setting an average temperature in order to get round the @entity41 ruling			2
it is important that taxpayers ’ money is used to help pensioners here			0
‘ an average temperature rule would ensure people here get it regardless			2
’ work and pensions secretary @entity23 ( left ) wants to stop people who live outside @entity3 from claiming the winter fuel allowance as minister @entity12 warns cutting all pensioner benefits will be an ' agenda item ' in discussions on the next @entity14 manifesto the winter fuel allowance is worth £ 200 for single pensioners , rising to £ 300 for the over 80s			1
around 12million people receive it each year			0
but critics have said it should be limited to poorer people who need extra help with their fuel bills			0
last week former @entity94 minister @entity93 suggested just the 2million poorest should be eligible , saving around £ 1.5billion			0
senior ministers are pushing mr @entity31 to ditch his pledge to protect the allowance			0
mr @entity12 today suggested the @entity14 leader had been rushed into promising not to cut them , and it would be an ‘ agenda ’ item for the next conservative manifesto			1
mr @entity12 said : ‘ before the election the @entity104 started putting out leaflets accusing us of planning to take away benefits from pensioners			2
‘ very rapidly a promise was given that we would n’t reduce benefits to pensioners , ’ he told @entity110			0
" we actually tied ourselves down for this parliament not addressing them			0
they , i ’m sure , when we get round , which we have n’t yet , contemplating our manifesto for the next election they ’ll be an agenda item			1

@entity123 will increase the number of @entity125 abroad who can claim winter fuel allowance
government *condemns* ' crazy ' idea as officials consider average temperature test so only those in @entity3 are eligible
@entity12 admits slashing pensioner benefits will be an ' agenda item ' for next @entity14 manifesto
