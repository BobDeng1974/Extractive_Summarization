@entity1 's second - half strike gave @entity2 an historic 1 - 0 victory over @entity4 as @entity2 enjoyed their first win at @entity6 in 76 years			1
the @entity7 struggled for most of the first - half against a confident visiting side with returning striker @entity10 missing the one real chance created			1
@entity12 stunned @entity6 when he drove the visitors into the lead in the 49th minute before the visitors came under siege			1
@entity70 rang out around the stadium at full - time , most of them aimed at boss @entity19 who has struggled to convince the @entity7 fans since taking over from @entity76 in the summer			0
this result will only provide further ammunition to his detractors			0
there was not a big crowd at @entity6 but the home fans were glad to see the return of @entity10			2
the @entity85 striker , on loan from @entity87 , had missed the home @entity89 win over @entity91 on thursday night as he was not registered in time for the competition but was the one change made by @entity19 , who dropped @entity34 to the bench			0
when @entity2 ' defender @entity47 crossed into the box within seconds of the kick - off - he found no takers - it demonstrated the visitors ' confidence			2
@entity1 points to the crowd as he and his team - mates run back to their half after the opening goal @entity4 captain @entity31 ( left ) slides in on @entity48 of @entity2 during the @entity106 match the home side , wearing black armbands in honour of former player @entity109 who passed away last week , took time to settle			1
accies were breaking with purpose and in the 11th minute midfielder @entity48 hooked a shot from the edge of the box over the bar			0
however , a minute later @entity10 should have opened the scoring when skipper @entity31 headed into his path but he screwed his shot from 12 yards past the far post			0
the game remained tepid which suited @entity2 who remained neat and tidy in possession			1
@entity4 's @entity124 ( left ) is challenged by @entity125 near the technical areas at @entity6 @entity2 's @entity50 ( left ) puts in a challenge on @entity10 during the match on sunday afternoon there was a burst of life on the half - hour mark when @entity6 defender @entity134 's hooked cross was met by fellow centre back @entity28 , whose header was saved by former @entity4 keeper @entity44 , who eventually scrambled the ball clear			1
moments later , there was a half - hearted appeal for a penalty when @entity50 challenged @entity10 but referee @entity62 was unimpressed as were the @entity7 fans when @entity31 stormed into the @entity2 box before failing to pick out a team - mate with his cross			2
the home side finished the half strongly with @entity32 , @entity36 and @entity31 all having efforts on goal			2
however , before the @entity56 midfielder 's drive was saved by @entity44 , @entity28 was dispossessed by lone striker @entity152 and it needed the pace of @entity29 to come to the rescue with a challenge at the edge of the box to concede a corner , the first of three in succession for @entity2 which came to nothing			2
@entity36 ( right ) beats @entity2 's @entity24 during @entity4 's @entity106 match on sunday @entity4 fans sing during their side 's match against @entity2 at @entity6 on sunday @entity10 had fired over the bar and @entity36 had sent a weak effort towards @entity44 before @entity2 took the lead			1
@entity47 's cross from the left arrived at the feet of @entity1 all of a sudden a shot was on and - as @entity29 challenged - the ball exploded low past @entity7 keeper @entity26 and into the net			0
the goal shook up the @entity6 players and their supporters			1
@entity35 ' drive from the edge of the box drew a fine save from @entity44 before @entity28 had a close - range header blocked			0
@entity19 replaced @entity10 with @entity37 and @entity33 with @entity34 just after the hour mark , the home fans showing their displeasure at the @entity85 departing although he had been off colour			0
@entity188 and white frustrations grew			0
left - back @entity30 passed when he should have shot and @entity36 headed wide from close range , although @entity2 might have made it 2 - 0 in the 69th minute had substitute @entity52 , on for @entity125 , not opted to shoot when @entity48 was better placed , the fruitless corner being scant consolation			0
@entity4 continued their ineptitude in front of goal - another @entity194 miss with a header was quite astonishing - with @entity2 regaining confidence and seeing out the game for an incredible victory .			1

@entity4 have struggled so far this *season* and sat sixth in the @entity106 going into the game
@entity2 , on the other hand , were second with a chance to go top
a single @entity1 goal won the game for the away side , their first win at @entity6 in 76 years
@entity2 moved top of the @entity106 , while @entity4 stayed *lagging* in sixth
