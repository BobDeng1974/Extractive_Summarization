the confusion over whether we should carry an umbrella with us when we leave the home is about to clear up - with the @entity4 dumping well - worn rain forecast terms in favour of predicting the chance of rain in your area as a percentage			1
when you hear a weather forecast , can you tell the difference between isolated showers , scattered showers and patchy rain ? what does the term ' a chance of rain ' really mean ? from this week , you wo n't have to know , thanks to a planned overhaul of descriptors used by the @entity4 ( @entity4 )			1
0 - 10 per cent - there will be no mention of rain in the forecast 20 - 30 per cent - slight chance of rain 40 - 60 per cent - medium chance 70 - 80 per cent - high change of rain 90 - 100 per cent - very high chance under the new system , adjectives such as patchy , scattered , widespread and isolated will be replaced with the more straightforward terms of slight , medium , high or very high to describe the chances of rainfall			1
the chance of rain will also be expressed in percentage terms , along with a forecast of how many millimetres of rain is expected			2
the change has become possible because of the bureau 's new @entity58 information system , which divides the nation into six square kilometre grids and allows for highly localised meteorological observations and forecasting within each square			2
national public weather manager @entity65 said the old system has had its day			0
the bureau of meteorology admits its system has reached its ' use - by date ' to be replaced by a more user friendly list of descriptions ' basically , we 're in a position that we can give people a bit more detail about when it 's going to rain and how much rain they 're likely to get , whereas in the past it was just words , ' he said			2
mr @entity65 said the bureau had undertaken research which found that ' some of the terms we used were n't specific enough '			1
' now we 're changing to what we hope will be a more meaningful presentation , ' he added			0
the new rain forecasts began in @entity88 and @entity89 on @entity90 , @entity91 , the @entity92 and @entity93 will begin in the new format on tuesday , followed by the @entity95 on wednesday and @entity96 on thursday ' we 're giving people a lot more background and detail now			0
' the new rain forecasts began in @entity88 and @entity89 on monday			0
@entity101 , @entity91 , the @entity92 and @entity93 will begin in the new format on tuesday , followed by the @entity95 on wednesday and @entity96 on thursday .			0

@entity4 to dump old - style descriptors like ' patchy and scattered '
the chances of *precipitation* will now be *equated* to a percentage and slight , medium or high chance of rain
the bureau says it has undertaken research and found their terminology was n't specific enough
all states and *territories* will be brought on line with the new system by the end of this week
