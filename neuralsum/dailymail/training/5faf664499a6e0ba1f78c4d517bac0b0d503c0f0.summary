‘ i ’ve always wanted to be happy , so i decided to be ’			0
such are the prophetic words of the most unlikely kit man the game has ever seen			1
@entity8 ’s drama @entity6 is the story of @entity11 - professional clown , greeter of students , bird fancier and , as @entity15 ( played by @entity16 ) says in this fabulous tall tale of real life , ‘ the best signing he ever made ’			1
@entity11 is played with astounding heart by @entity20			1
but not all the weight is placed on this diminutive powerhouse ’s shoulders			0
former @entity24 kit man @entity11 had a drama named ‘ @entity6 ’ aired last thursday about his life @entity20 plays @entity11 in the @entity8 drama that was watched by 1.5million viewers @entity20 ( left ) shares @entity11 's ( right ) real - life experiences throughout the show @entity16 ( right ) also portrays @entity15 ( left ) who was @entity24 boss when @entity11 was the club 's kit man @entity11 ( played by @entity20 ) was known as @entity34 due to his passion for wanting to join the circus as a kid because one of the great twists in the way this story is told , is that @entity20 ’s @entity11 occasionally has a chat with the real @entity11			1
as indeed does the real @entity15			2
and it is a fantastic little dramatic device , because it serves to remind us that we are in fact seeing remarkable , life - affirming things that actually happened			2
@entity11 is one of life ’s innocents , who has simply gone about his business with the assumption that if you ask for it , you ’ll more than likely get it			2
we first see him as @entity34 the clown , because as a kid he wanted to join the circus			2
but when he falls out with the ringmaster , he makes his way home to @entity60 and decides to pursue another course			0
first he turns up at @entity62 to , well , welcome students			0
no one asked him to			0
he just thought he should			0
but then he meets @entity15 , the newly appointed manager of @entity11 ’s beloved @entity24			1
and before you know it , @entity34 the clown is the @entity69 ' kit man			1
@entity11 ( left ) struck an extremely close bond with @entity24 boss @entity15 ( right ) during his tenure in charge @entity11 ( left ) infamously lifted his kilt up once while @entity15 ( right ) was conducting a tv interview aside from his relationship with his ailing mum - beautifully played by @entity78 - this is the real soul of the story			1
because we are seeing a very square peg in an extraordinarily round hole			0
he gets stick from some players			0
he gets abuse from the crowd			0
but @entity11 ’s extraordinary ability to insist on always drinking from a glass half full means that he ultimately becomes something of a hero to both - while , at times , dressed in a chicken suit , or doing his @entity93 team talks in top hat and tails			1
there is even a great actual clip of @entity15 being interviewed on the @entity24 pitch while @entity11 sneaks into shot to show us what he ’s wearing under his comedy kilt ! @entity11 earned @entity24 cult status ( played by @entity20 - far right ) for stunts such as dressing in a chicken suit @entity78 plays @entity11 's mum in the drama - a figure who was dearly close to the @entity24 kit man this relationship between gaffer and kit man was clearly so strong , the real @entity15 confirms at one point to his actor counterpart that he did actually bring @entity116 on as a sub in a testimonial			1
although as the real @entity11 tells @entity11 when sitting together in the @entity24 dug out , he did n’t actually score with the flying header that we see @entity20 tuck away with aplomb			1
so perhaps some things are just a bit too extraordinary			0
as has @entity11 ’s life , @entity6 features some great little star cameos including @entity126 - who helped him recruit players for the @entity128 - and @entity129 , who turned up to ref a game for him			1
and as we see at the end of the programme , @entity131 is still a team			2
@entity62 presented him with an honorary degree and the @entity24 crowd sings his name			0
and his church choir was happy to come together to perform a rendition of the club ’s anthem ‘ delilah ’			0
people , it would seem , just ca n’t help but like doing nice things for @entity11			2
@entity11 ( played by @entity20 ) managed to play for @entity24 - coming on a substitute during a testimonial once @entity126 ( right ) helped @entity11 recruit players for his side aptly named @entity128			1

@entity8 drama called ' marvellous ' was aired last thursday
@entity153 portrayed the life of **legend*ary* @entity156 kit man @entity11
@entity11 is a @entity69 cult *legend* for his antics which included dressing as a chicken once or doing his @entity93 team talks in top hat and tails
known as @entity34 he enjoyed a close bond with then boss @entity15
@entity11 is played by @entity20 and @entity15 by @entity16 in the show
