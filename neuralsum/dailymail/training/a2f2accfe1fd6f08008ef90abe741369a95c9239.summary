one of @entity1 ’s brightest rising stars has challenged @entity3 ’s position on the private sector providing free @entity6 services , declaring : ‘ what matters is what works ’			1
@entity9 , a @entity10 shadow health minister who is increasingly tipped as a future party leader , struck a markedly different tone on @entity6 ‘ privatisation ’ to mr @entity3 and her immediate boss , @entity14			1
she also warned against @entity1 becoming ‘ the moaning man in the pub ’ and defended middle class voters with ‘ sharp elbows ’ who demand the best from public services			1
@entity9 , a @entity10 shadow health minister who is increasingly tipped as a future party leader , struck a markedly different tone on @entity6 ‘ privatisation ’ to mr @entity3 and her immediate boss , @entity14 mr @entity3 has accused the government of ‘ privatising and fragmenting the @entity6 ’ , though in fact there has been a much smaller rise in the number of @entity6 services provided by private sector providers under the coalition than there was under @entity1			1
mr @entity14 , meanwhile , has called for a moratorium on new contracts being signed and claimed the government wants to let ‘ the market … carry on ripping through the @entity6 ’			2
the shadow health secretary has also insisted ‘ the @entity6 as we know it wo n’t exist ’ if the @entity38 remain in power			1
but miss @entity9 , in an interview with political magazine @entity41 , insisted : ‘ there will remain a role for the private and voluntary sectors where they can add extra capacity to the @entity6 or challenges to the system			1
' i believe what matters is what works			0
that ’s what i ’ve always believed in and i continue to believe in			0
’ she praised the privately - run independent treatment centres ( @entity57 ) first created by @entity59 ’s government , while she was an adviser in the @entity60 , which were credited with helping to cut @entity6 waiting times			0
@entity3 has accused the government of ‘ privatising and fragmenting the @entity6 ’ , though in fact there has been a much smaller rise in the number of @entity6 services provided by private sector providers under the coalition than there was under @entity1 ‘ i remember when i worked in the @entity60 a very senior clinician saying “ you ’ve got one of these @entity78 down the road now so i ’m going to have to talk to some of my gp colleagues about getting my waits down and stop doing so much private practice ”			1
‘ so it did bring challenge to the system			0
it was the @entity6 – and the increased investment we put in the @entity6 – that delivered the vast majority of the reductions in the waits			0
but some challenge in the system was crucial to that			0
‘ i think we need real reforms of our public services , including the @entity6 and social care , in many different areas			1
’ she backed the idea of medical consultations by @entity98 and @entity99 , insisting : ‘ it is a disgrace how little we have used technology to transform people ’s experience			0
@entity14 has called for a moratorium on new contracts being signed and claimed the government wants to let ‘ the market … carry on ripping through the @entity6 ’ ' this [ she points to her @entity99 ] is part of my life now and that is how people increasingly expect to interact with the @entity6			2
‘ some people think “ oh , it ’s just some pushy middle class people wanting to get things from their doctor when and where they want ”			2
i do n’t think there ’s anything wrong with making sure that our @entity6 needs to meet the needs and demands of middle class people or anybody else			1
’ miss @entity9 also suggested @entity1 needed to demonstrate how it would reform public services in an age of austerity			1
‘ without doubt , post-financial crash , and the constraints in public spending that there rightfully has to be , it was very clear that the @entity6 needs to contribute to that as a whole , ’ she said			2
‘ on the left we do have to show how we can deliver our goals of social justice and fairness when there ’s less money around			0
but also because we need to make services work better for people			0
’ asked whether she wanted to be @entity1 leader , the shadow minister said : ‘ if anyone says anything nice about me it ’s incredibly flattering			2
all i care about is winning on may 7			0
all i care about is getting @entity3 [ @entity151 ] into @entity152 , full stop			0
’ @entity1 has made the @entity6 central to its election campaign , issuing a poster claiming the health service ‘ as you know it can not survive five more years of @entity160 ’ and claiming that public spending would be cut back to 1930s levels			2
@entity38 mps accuse the party of hypocrisy and shroud - waving , since expenditure on @entity6 services provided free of charge by private providers has risen at a slower rate since 2010 than in the four years before , when @entity1 was in power			1
overall , only around just six pence in every pound is spent in the @entity6 with the private sector , compared to around five pence under @entity1 .			0

@entity9 warned against @entity1 becoming ' the moaning man in the pub '
she defended middle class voters who demand best from public services
the rising @entity1 star insisted ‘ the @entity6 as we know it wo n’t exist ’ if the @entity38 remain in power
miss @entity9 is increasingly tipped as a future party leader
