by @entity0 flanked by bargain - priced displays of women 's wear and patio lighting , president @entity1 came to a @entity5 in @entity6 on friday to praise new steps by businesses and communities to deploy solar energy			1
the president was showcasing efforts to combat climate change that do n't rely on a disinclined @entity14			0
but in choosing the giant retailer as the backdrop for his announcement , @entity1 also triggered a backlash from labor unions and pay equity advocates who say low wages paid by @entity5 fly in the face of @entity1 's vaunted push on pay equity			1
@entity1 said more than 300 companies and state and local governments have pledged to use solar technology , and he unveiled his own executive actions aimed at increasing energy efficiency with a goal of reducing @entity47 reliance on carbon fuels			1
the two tracks underscored @entity1 's strategy of sidestepping @entity14 to advance his own agenda , but they also illustrated the limits of his reach in a bitterly divided government			1
' the commitments we 're announcing today prove that there are cost - effective ways to tackle climate change and create jobs at the same time , ' @entity1 said at a sprawling @entity5 in @entity30			2
president @entity1 speaks at a @entity29 store in @entity30 , @entity31 , on friday the solar effort will power the equivalent of 130,000 homes , the @entity36 said , while @entity1 's administrative actions could reduce carbon pollution in an amount equal to taking 80 million cars off the road for one year			1
the @entity36 also announced that long - delayed energy efficiency standards for walk - in coolers and freezers have finally been completed			0
ticking off a list of economic and environmental benefits he attributed to solar technology , @entity1 cast the commitments as part of a broader campaign to reduce @entity47 energy dependence , create jobs in renewable energy and lower heat - trapping emissions blamed for global warming			1
' this is what you call a win - win - win , ' @entity1 told about 250 store employees as he wrapped up a three - day swing through @entity31 focused heavily on raising money for @entity91 in advance of november 's midterm elections			2
@entity1 announced new steps by companies , local governments and his own administration to deploy solar technology tweaking the mostly @entity100 opponents of his energy policies in @entity14 , @entity1 lamented that lawmakers have ' not always been as visionary on these issues as we would like			1
' that 's why he 's seizing opportunities this year to act unilaterally to advance those goals , @entity1 said			2
' unfortunately , inside of @entity110 , we still have some climate deniers who shout loud , ' @entity1 said			0
' but they 're wasting people 's time on a settled debate			0
' his policies unable to generate momentum in @entity14 , @entity1 has increasingly gone outside the federal government to press his agenda			0
he has won commitments from colleges and universities to expand access to more students ; he has created innovation hubs that link businesses and education institutions ; and he has drawn attention to companies and state and local governments that have increased pay for workers			1
president @entity1 waves after speaking at the @entity29 store still , that choice of tactics has severely limited what @entity1 may be able to accomplish , a reality the president acknowledged the night before as he spoke to donors at a fundraiser in @entity144 benefiting @entity36 @entity91			0
' regardless of how hard i push , regardless of how many administrative actions i take , we 're not going to be able to go where we need to go , and can go , and should go unless i 've got a @entity14 that 's willing to work with me , ' @entity1 said			2
the @entity36 said it chose @entity5 because the company has committed to doubling the number of solar energy projects at its stores , @entity153 and distribution centers			2
the @entity5 location he visited gets about 15 percent of its power from solar panels			0
@entity5 's president , @entity158 , said			0
@entity1 is the first president to visit one of the chain 's warehouse stores .			0
