by @entity0 published : 23:56 est , 22 july 2012 updated : 10:57 est , 23 july 2012 new home : @entity2 is home to a breeding pair of black redstarts , who have made a nest in a hospitality chalet with the deafening sound of jet engines and the commotion caused by hundreds of thousands of visitors , it seems an unlikely place to bring up your brood			1
but @entity2 is home to a breeding pair of black redstarts , who have made a nest to care for four chicks in the roof of a hospitality chalet			1
the birds , so rare that they are protected by law , stunned wildlife experts when they were found nesting at the festival in @entity27 , @entity28			1
organisers were due to take down the chalet when the show finished last week , having attracted 227,000 visitors and seen the sale of aircraft worth £ 46billion			1
but they decided to leave it up for an extra two weeks to avoid disturbing the chicks , which are only two weeks old			0
experts believe there are only about 40 black redstarts in the country			1
@entity42 , of @entity43 , said the birds were brown with a red tail and a little bigger than a robin			2
' black redstarts are one of the ten rarest birds in @entity50 and a delight to watch , ' he added			1
' they have a tendency to nest in unusual places such as power stations and building sites but their new home is equally bizarre			0
' this breeding pair have found a little hole in the side of a chalet and set up home for their chicks despite the bustling crowds and noisy aircraft			1
' once you are aware the birds are nesting it is a criminal offence to disturb them so the airshow have to leave them in peace			1
' mr @entity42 has seen the breeding pair leaving the nest and returning every three or four minutes , collecting small insects to feed to their chicks			0
airshow spokesman @entity78 said the birds had nested in a chalet hired by @entity82 aerobatic team			1
the chalet , which was put up in march , contains a kitchen , reception and lounge / dining area			2
organisers were due to take down the chalet when the show finished last week , having attracted 227,000 visitors and seen the sale of aircraft worth £ 46billion			2
the nest location is circled ms @entity78 said : ' we do n't know precisely when the birds occupied their chalet but we only found out about their existence last week			1
' on average 60 people per day are hosted in a single unit			0
then the flying displays begin , which are incredibly noisy with the @entity102 aircraft and other fast jets displaying on a daily basis			0
' the birds seem totally unfazed by all the activity around them			2
' they regularly pop in and out to feed the young chicks , which we believe to number four			0
' i guess the parents got used to the daily activities around the show as it built up			0
' once the chicks were hatched i understand the bond is strong enough that the adult birds will not leave them			2
' ms @entity78 said the chicks would probably be ready to leave the chalet in about a week 's time			2
an @entity123 ( x7 ) takes off at the @entity2 - a seven - day international trade fair for the aerospace industry visited by hundreds of thousands of aviation enthusiasts she said organisers decided not to publicise the birds ' presence when they first spotted them last week			1
she added : ' it would have been easy for them to be disturbed by people wanting to see the nest and catch a glimpse of the redstarts			0
' the show is now closed and we have a secure and private environment for the birds to nest in - or as privately and undisturbed as they can be when the world 's largest temporary exhibition is being de-rigged			0
' we are usually plane spotters not bird spotters but this week we have taken a keen interest in nature 's great flying machines			0
' we are all really excited to have the birds with us on site and are keeping them as safe as we possibly can			0
' it 's fantastic they chose to nest with us			0
