a @entity1 ball boy may soon find himself a whole lot richer			1
the young man , whose name is still unknown , pocketed a foul ball hit by @entity6 last night during the baseball 's stars final home game at @entity10 , and some are saying the ball could fetch as much as $ 10,000			1
and while the ball boy , or girl , is expected to toss all foul balls into the crowd for the fans , there is no official rule that says they can not keep the ball			2
the young man cleanly fielded the grounder , held it in his glove , and then reached into his back pocket pulling out another ball and handing it off to a fan in the stands			0
it is uncertain if the boy kept the ball for himself , or if the @entity1 asked those on the field to hold on to the balls for the sake of having @entity6 memorabilia			2
the @entity1 may have also wanted to avoid hysteria or fighting among fans for the ball			0
handoff : the boy pulled a new ball out of his pocket ( above ) and kept @entity6 's ball fair play : there is no rule that says a ball boy , or girl , ca n't keep a ball if it is the former , it was one lucrative move for the man , as some are saying it could fetch up to $ 10,000			1
' it ’s a pretty great thing , i ’d love to have it for our auction , ' @entity69 , director of acquisitions at @entity71 , told @entity77			0

celebration : @entity6 's teammates lift him up after he hit a game winning walkoff rbi last night against the @entity32 ' it ’s worth the most it ’s ever going to be worth last night , ' said @entity69			1
' as @entity6 fades from the spotlight , so do prices			0
' no doubt making the ball even more valuable is how @entity6 ended his last home game ever yesterday - with a walkoff rbi single			1
that 's one epic way to go out			0
