@entity0 has removed and apologised for a tweet promoting its end of year sales that was slammed on social media tweet for being insensitive to the missing @entity6 flight			1
part of a series of efforts to promote deals on the beleaguered airline 's routes up to june 2015 , its official @entity8 account @ @entity0 posted : ' want to go somewhere , but do n't know where ? our year - end specials might just help ! # keepflying '			2
followers were quick to show their outrage at the post , drawing the unfortunate connection to the @entity6 flight			2
a @entity0 @entity23 , the same as the @entity6 flight which went missing in march and the @entity24 which was shot down over eastern @entity25 in july this year @entity0 apologises for their tweet : ' want to go somewhere , but do n't know where ? our year - end specials might just help ! # keepflying ' the airline removed the original tweet but continued to suffer criticism from @entity8 users the airline 's @entity23 flight from @entity34 to @entity35 disappeared on march 8 with 227 passengers from 15 countries and 12 @entity0 crew on board and remains missing			1
@entity0 removed the post and tweeted : ' our tweet was intended to inspire travellers to explore deals offered			1
we apologize for any offence caused & have removed it ! ' @entity46 tweeted the airline on thursday from @ tpowellwow , saying : ' probably not the best choice of words for an airline that does n't know where one of its planes is - just saying # mas370 '			0
@entity0 has posted numerous tweets promoting their sales and its # keepflying campaign but only when they wrote ' want to go somewhere , but do n't know where ? ' was it considered offensive others were n't so savoury in their criticism of the airline			1
after removing the initially offensive tweet , @entity0 responded to its critics while retweeting a post from @entity70 's @ jono_dubs : ' do n't understand all the haters blasting # mas for their promotions ? some people are trying ' @entity0 replied , ' thanks for your support '			1
