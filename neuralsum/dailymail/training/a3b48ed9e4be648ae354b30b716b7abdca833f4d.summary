under - fire boss @entity0 has dismissed suggestions he is feeling the pressure at goalless @entity3 after another defeat			1
they slipped to a 2 - 0 loss at home to @entity8 on saturday and have not scored in eight hours and 42 minutes of action			1
@entity3 are the lowest scorers in the @entity11 with just 11 goals in 22 games and have won just twice in their last 18 league games			2
@entity0 says he is not feeling the pressure at @entity3 despite poor form @entity0 ( left ) during the @entity17 final in 1997 , while playing for @entity18 but @entity0 , who won the @entity17 as a player with @entity18 in 1997 , insisted he knows how to handle the heat			1
' listen , if you saw me before the @entity17 final that was pressure , ' he said , after @entity3 drew a fifth straight league blank			1
' i thought my a * * * was going to fall out of my shorts			0
' no , no. pressure ? high - level football ? i 'm fortunate , i 've been at the top level playing in @entity17 finals and things like that , so pressure is part and parcel of my nature			2
it 's part and parcel of the game of football			0
@entity39 scores the opening goal against a hapless @entity3 early on during the @entity11 match @entity0 runs away in celebration after doubling @entity8 's lead with a little more than 10 minutes remaining ' you have to handle it			1
i 'm strong enough to handle it			0
' @entity39 and @entity47 won it for @entity8 to underline @entity3 's struggles although a planned protest , against chairman @entity51 and @entity0 from the home fans , failed to make an impact			1
the supporters may be unhappy , yet there were only muted chants against @entity0 , and the manager insisted the club can not compete on the level it used to			2
he said : ' this club has been embroiled in major things - @entity62 cups , league titles , all that sort of thing			2
' the ' 82 team is probably the greatest side this club will ever see			0
those guys will quite rightly always be well respected at this football club for what they achieved			0
' but now it is what it is			0
i do n't moan about it			0
