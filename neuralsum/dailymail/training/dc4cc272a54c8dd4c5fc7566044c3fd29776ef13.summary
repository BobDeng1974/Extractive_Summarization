by @entity0 the story of @entity2 read like every other man 's in the 19th century - he was a labourer , husband and father			1
but underneath the suit and tie was a body of a woman named @entity10 - also known as @entity11 - who could have been @entity12 's first transgender person			2
mr @entity2 arrived on @entity12 shores from @entity14 in june 1856 as an assisted immigrant on - board the @entity16			1
it is speculated he was born between 1829 to 1841 due to a discrepancy in shipping lists , and birth , marriage and death certificates			0
@entity2 who could be @entity12 's first transgender person as a woman ( left ) and as a man ( right ) during his stint in @entity26 a portrait of @entity2 in male and female attire			2
the image is probably a fake cut - and - paste produced by a photographer after it was discovered @entity2 was a man according to ship records , he was a 26 - year - old @entity33 from @entity34 who could read and write , and was listed as a housemaid			2
when she arrived in @entity38 , mr @entity2 was still known as @entity10 and caused quite a stir on the trip over			1
according to the @entity41 of @entity38 's @entity42 , he wore a man 's shirt and trousers underneath his dress and had formed sexual attachments to some of the other female passengers on the @entity16 , including his soon - to - be first wife , @entity50 - a 34 - year - old governess who was also from @entity14			2
he travelled with a trunk labelled with the name ' @entity2 ' on it who , according to @entity2 ' third wife , was his uncle			0
there was also speculation her husband or lover was named ' @entity2 ' and he had somehow tricked the transsexual by placing his trunk on the @entity16 and deserted the 26 - year - old			0
mr @entity2 ' , who was still identified as a woman , first job in @entity12 was as a maidservant at a @entity67 public house but some time after he left his position and started dressing like a man , and ditched the name of @entity10			1
mr @entity2 continued living as a man for 25 years after he left @entity26 in 1879 ( left ) and the right picture is of him and his third wife , @entity73 now as @entity74 , he went and sought out ms @entity50 , marrying her at @entity75 in @entity76 , @entity77			1
but their marriage was not a happy one , with evidence suggesting they ' did not live comfortably together '			0
after ms @entity50 opened a school in @entity85 , she left mr @entity2 and married an @entity87 mining surveyor @entity86 who lived in @entity88 - north - west of @entity77			1
in the next 20 years , mr @entity2 married twice - his second wife was @entity90 who died of pulmonary tuberculosis in 1867 and a @entity73 of @entity92 - north of @entity77			1
mr @entity2 worked as a carter , miner , blacksmith and ploughman in the areas of @entity85 , @entity92 and @entity98			1
the breakdown of his third marriage came after march 1878 when ms @entity73 gave birth to a child fathered by her brother - in - law , @entity103			0
despite mr @entity2 knowing it was not his child , he registered himself as the child 's father but his resentment over the pregnancy started taking its toll on the marriage			1
in july 1879 , he started violently acting out against ms @entity73 and his 15 - month - old daughter , fell into a deep depression and then was admitted to @entity114 's lunacy ward for amentia - a mental disability			0
another portrait done of mr @entity2 done by @entity117 who was active between 1882 - 1891 for the first six weeks of his stint in the hospital , mr @entity2 refused to bathe until he was transferred to the @entity26 and forcibly stripped that his secret was discovered			2
he was handed over to female nurses and forced to dress as a woman in an interview , mr @entity2 ' recalled the moment he was outed as a female at @entity26			2
' i was sittin ’ the carriage at the railway station , an ’ the wife was cryin ’ and the kid was squealin ’ , an ’ i was laughin ’ at ‘ em , ' he said during an interview			0
' well , when we got to @entity26 , the fellers there took hold o ’ me to give me a bath , an ’ they stripped me to put me in the water , an ’ then they saw the mistake			0
' one feller ran off as if he was frightened ; the others looked thunderstruck an ’ could n't speak			0
' i was handed over to the women , and they dressed me up in frocks and petticoats			0
' mr @entity2 ' outing as a female caused a worldwide stir , with one photographer named @entity148 sneaking into the hospital and taking photos of the transsexual dressed as a man and a woman as well as possibly a straitjacket			1
as a transgender person , mr @entity2 ' faced brutal treatment inside the asylum including a report done up by @entity159 that said he cried and screamed as he was probed during a gynaecological examination - which verified he was a physiologically a woman			2
a drawing done of mr @entity2 entitled the @entity92 impersonator working as a man at the @entity38 goldfields with the news in circulation , mr @entity2 received offers to be ' publicly exhibited ' and after his release from @entity26 he took up the opportunities			1
he was once offered three to five pounds per week for a tour			0
he appeared as ' the @entity172 ' at @entity173 on @entity174 in @entity77 in january 1880 and another time alongside a trapeze artist and ' the electric boy ' at @entity178 's @entity177 on @entity179 in september 1880			0
when the truth came out his wife , ms @entity73 denied knowing her husband was in fact a woman and accounted for her daughter 's existence by telling reporters : ' some strange man entered the house one night about the time her husband should have returned home '			0
ms @entity73 also stated her husband would never let her see him stripped or washing himself			0
additionally , mr @entity2 could have fooled his wife into thinking he was a man by fashioning a homemade strap - on dildo			1
there was also evidence mr @entity2 ' second wife , @entity90 , found out about her husband 's cross-dressing about a year into their marriage a witness reported seeing ms @entity90 punching mr @entity2 in the breast - her ' weak place '			2
mr @entity2 lived as a man for another 25 years and found no success in show business			1
in february 1881 , he was applying for relief at the @entity208 and wanted to be admission to the @entity210			0
mr @entity2 died in august 1901 in the @entity211 at @entity212 , where he had been since february 1881 .			1
