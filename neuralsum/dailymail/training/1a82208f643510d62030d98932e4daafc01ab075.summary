by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 04:28 est , 14 august 2012 updated : 04:51 est , 14 august 2012 the @entity3 - led @entity2 has found a new front man against the @entity5 - @entity4			1
the yoga guru is currently protesting against the @entity8 's alleged inefficiency in tacking black money and corruption			1
@entity4 's agitation during at sit - in at the @entity13 turned into an extended @entity2 gathering with @entity3 president @entity14 , @entity16 chief @entity15 , @entity3 supremo @entity17 , @entity3 leader @entity18 and representatives from the @entity20 joining him on the dais			1
riding the wave : @entity4 ( centre ) with @entity3 chief @entity14 and @entity25 - @entity24 president @entity15 at @entity27 ground @entity4 , the pied piper of the assembly , played his own tune against the @entity31 , particularly the @entity32 , as his followers cheered with a renewed vigour			2
' this protest is to ensure that no dishonest person enters @entity37			1
such people should be boycotted			2
we do not have a political agenda			0
the dwindling support for @entity4 at the @entity13 soared yesterday as the political leaders came in with their own squad of agitators to the venue			2
@entity4 leans out of the bus window and waves to supporters after being detained @entity4 ’s platform gave the @entity3 an opportunity to make common cause with some of its former allies such as the @entity55 ( @entity55 ) , the @entity56 ( @entity56 ) and the @entity57 ( @entity57 ) , whose representatives were also present at the ground			1
@entity14 assured @entity4 full support of the @entity3 in his agitation against black money			1
' this agitation should not be seen from a political prism			0
this is an agitation of the people of the country and not of a single party			0
black money should be brought back and spent on the country ’s development , ' he said			1
an unexpected bonus for the @entity4 came in the form of support from the @entity76 and the @entity77 , which are supporting the @entity5 from outside			1
the fusing together of the @entity79 parties around @entity4 is the product of a series of meetings that took place between the yoga guru and leaders of the @entity3			1
full capacity : crowds surround the yoga guru @entity4 had a closed - door meeting with @entity14 on the eve of his agitation that began on august 9			1
he conducted further discussions with @entity14 , @entity93 and @entity94 in another meeting			0
in july , a prominent lawyer - politician facilitated a meeting between @entity4 and @entity99 chief minister @entity98 in @entity100			2
buoyed by political support , @entity4 has dug his heels in at @entity103 , where he has been lodged with his supporters , and has refused to leave despite the police deciding to free him			1
@entity4 said he would stay there the night and decide the next course of action later			2
this has given the @entity110 a headache as they need to sanitise the area because prime minister @entity113 will pass through it on august 15			0
the police brass briefed the @entity117 home ministry on monday evening even as they continued their efforts to persuade @entity4 break his fast and leave			1
however , the yoga guru has stumped the police by demanding that they provide food to all his supporters if they wanted him to break his fast			1
earlier , despite deploying a large number of security personnel , the police had a tough time controlling the yoga guru and his supporters as they marched towards @entity37			1
after fiveand - a- half hours of high drama , they were finally detained under @entity132 of the @entity133 , which is a preventive measure			0
@entity137 after the flak following the midnight crackdown on @entity4 ’s fast last year , the police were restrained this time			1
' the @entity3 ’s calculation was simple			0
as @entity4 has some following in smaller towns as well as in the urban middle class , supporting him would benefit the party , ' said a party source			2
what worked for the @entity3 was that @entity4 , unlike @entity145 , had no qualms in aligning with the party and , more importantly , had no plans of launching a political outfit			2
moreover , it was easy for the @entity3 to back the yoga guru on the black money issue as it had earlier been raised by @entity93			1
@entity4 on his part , needed the @entity79 ’s political backing to avoid an embarrassing end to his agitation like the @entity13 fiasco last year			2
the support of parties such as the @entity55 , the @entity20 and the @entity56 was largely the result of @entity4 ’s meetings with @entity161 , @entity162 , and @entity163 in june			0
he also met @entity165 chief @entity164			0
the @entity167 ’s hand in shaping @entity4 ’s agitation has been known for some time			0
the seeds of the protest at the @entity13 last year were sown in a meeting in early 2011 at the @entity172 in south @entity173			0
the meeting was attended by @entity167 ideologue @entity175 , @entity177 chief @entity176 , @entity17 and @entity4			0
this was part of the @entity167 ’s effort to “ consolidating splinter movements ”			0
sources said it has been @entity14 ’s gameplan to get @entity4 , @entity17 and @entity175 to play a more active political role , perhaps in order to provide a counterweight to “ @entity173 - based ” leaders of the @entity3 as well as to maintain the ideological dominance of the rss			0
the coordination between the @entity3 and @entity4 was perfect as party mps created a ruckus in the @entity192 on monday on the black money issue			1
at the @entity13 , @entity4 , who had been postponing his “ big announcement ” since friday , finally blew the bugle on monday morning , asking his supporters to get ready to court arrest			2
around 1.15 pm , the yoga guru began his march towards @entity37 with thousands of supporters			1
the cavalcade , however , could not move beyond 300 metres and about 10 minutes into the march , it was stopped by the police near the @entity206 flyover			0
soon it became clear that @entity4 had been detained and was being taken to @entity208 in @entity209 on the outskirts of the city			2
“ @entity110 is a puppet in the hands of the central government			0
we will not do anything that disrupts peace , ” @entity4 told his supporters			2
the police had a tough time making their way through the crowd			0
even the rains could not move the supporters away			0
it was only around 6 pm that the buses carrying @entity4 and his aides left			0
since the number of protesters was large , the police decided to take @entity4 to @entity103 near @entity230			1
now , he is camping at the stadium			0
this has triggered another security issue as the @entity103 falls on prime minister @entity113 ’s route to the @entity235 where he will hoist the national flag on august 15			0
@entity4 has not yet announced his next course of action but a member of his team said they would present a memorandum on black money and corruption to president @entity245 on tuesday			1

@entity4 is currently protesting against the @entity5 @entity8 's alleged inefficiency in tacking black money and corruption
@entity4 : ' this protest is to ensure that no dishonest person enters @entity37 . such people should be boycotted '
yoga guru was detained at the @entity103 in the capital , but later released
he refused to leave or break his fast demanding that all his supporters be fed first
