women who like to work out know that finding perfectly - fitting underwear that ’s supportive , can be just as challenging as running a marathon			1
now , scientists have created a ‘ bionic bra ’ that automatically tightens in response to breast movement , in a bid to make running more comfortable for women			1
the smart underwear prototype contains hidden sensors to monitor and control movement			1

from right to left , professor @entity17 , professor @entity18 and dr @entity19 are pictured it has so far taken researchers at the @entity22 ( @entity22 ) , in @entity23 , @entity24 , 15 years to develop and it could still be a while before it hits the shops			1
professor @entity18 , executive research director of the @entity26 for @entity27 , based at the university , explained that progress has been accelerated of late because the team discovered new actuators and sensing technologies			2
‘ our ability to make things from advanced materials has been greatly enhanced recently with the advent of new approaches to fabrication , ’ he said			2
‘ the advent of approaches such as 3d printing has enabled us to assemble structures containing new sensing technologies to more accurately monitor movement and new artificial muscle technologies to control it			1
keep on running : the underwear is designed to make running more comfortable for women ( pictured ) and to prevent long - term damage caused by underwear that provides no support almost one third of 1,300 female runners who registered for the @entity53 in 2013 said they experienced breast pain when exercising			1
perhaps unsurprisingly , the proportion that complained of discomfort rose with increasing cup size , the @entity55 reported			0
half of those with a cup size of @entity62 or larger complained of pain , compared with one in four of those with an a size cup			0
while half blamed the pain on their menstrual cycle , three in 10 said it was associated with unsupportive underwear , with nine out of 10 wearing a sports bra half of the women surveyed said they experienced breast pain during moderate exercise while almost two thirds said their breasts were painful during vigorous exercise			2
as many as one in 10 described the pain as ' distressing ' or ' excruciating ' and one in six said it put them off exercising			0
‘ these advances have inspired us to ( re ) confront the challenges involved in creating the @entity85			0
’ since the beginning of the project , professor @entity17 , director of breast research australia at @entity22 , has been investigating the movement of women ’s breast during physical activity			1
she said that without the right breast support , long - term damage can be done , including numbness in the fingers caused by compression of nerves on the shoulders , as well as neck and back pain			1
‘ unfortunately , the most supportive sports bras tend to be the most uncomfortable to wear			0
‘ making matters worse , bra research has found that 85 per cent of women are wearing bras that do not fit or support their breasts correctly , ’ she said			2
while the bionic bra is a step closer to hitting shops , there are still some problems that need to be ironed out			0
professor @entity114 said : ‘ although we have made substantial progress , we still have a way to go before the bionic bra can be taken from the bench top to the washing machine			0
however , when finished , the bionic bra will transform bra design			0
’ team member dr @entity19 added : ‘ results indicate that our technologies can sense breast motion and provide additional breast support			0
‘ the challenge now is to integrate these technologies into a functional , comfortable bra			2
’ professor @entity18 spoke about the smart bra at the 9th @entity132 ( @entity133 ) where research to measure the effectiveness of rugby headwear was also a hot topic .			0

researchers at the @entity22 , @entity24 , have been working on the bra for 15 years and have finally completed a prototype
it contains hidden actuators and sensors to monitor and control movement
underwear is designed to make running more comfortable for women
and to prevent long - term damage caused by a lack of support
