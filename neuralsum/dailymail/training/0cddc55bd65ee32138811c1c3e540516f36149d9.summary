to his legions of admirers on this side of the pond , there is no need to fret			0
@entity7 will stay for as long as he is wanted			1
diplomatically the plan is to wait until @entity10 ’s chief executive ( @entity9 ) has sat down with @entity12 ’s chief executive ( @entity9 ) to reach the inevitable conclusion			1
they can get around the pr easily enough because @entity7 , at the age of 36 , is still a top quality asset in the @entity18			1
this was a rasping strike from the edge of the area , the type he used to despatch so regularly when he was wearing the colours of @entity26			0
suddenly those days when he was chasing down the great @entity52 ’s goalscoring record , which he eventually overhauled , feels like a lifetime ago			0
there is no doubt , after four months as a @entity10 player , @entity7 is a blue through and through			1
‘ i do n’t think anyone can find it strange the way @entity7 plays football , ’ claimed @entity10 ’s manager @entity20			1
‘ he knows how to play the game			0
at the age of 36 he can not play three games in a week , not 90 minutes every game , but he played 90 minutes against @entity65 so it was n’t good for him to start again			0
@entity7 's shot flew past @entity68 and @entity69 before hitting the back of the net @entity20 will look to keep @entity7 at the @entity72 for as long as possible @entity10 1 - 1 @entity26 ( 1 ) @entity10 7 - 0 @entity73 wednesday ( 2 ) @entity74 2 - 4 @entity10 ‘ he always makes the difference because he is a top player			1
’ stateside they will will wonder when they will ever see @entity7 wearing the @entity12 shirt because when life is this good , you do n’t want to walk away from something like this			1
in a couple of weeks ’ time , provided @entity10 overcome the final hurdle in their @entity88 group game with @entity89 , they will be in the draw for second round			0
anyone who has ever come into contact with @entity7 , who is technically on loan from his @entity96 team , will know of the midfielder ’s love for @entity101 football ’s elite competition			1
he has played in seven @entity88 semi-finals , going on to win it with @entity26 in 2012 and you simply would n’t bet against him going deep in to this competition with @entity10			2
to walk away from that , plus the realistic possibility of slugging it out with @entity26 for the @entity18 title , is not in @entity7 ’s make - up			1
the guy is a winner			0
it is unthinkable for him to leave mid-way through a campaign , particularly when @entity7 calls all the shots			1
the alternative is to join in with pre-season training with the other six players who have so far been signed by @entity12 in preparation for their mls bow in march			1
you do the math. @entity7 ’s numbers are already stacking up at @entity10			2
this was his fifth goal since his surprise move to the @entity72 following his release by @entity130 last season			2
@entity20 worked with @entity132 after the @entity134 midfielder left @entity135 to join @entity136 @entity7 and @entity137 know they will have to play the rotation game if they are to prolong their careers ‘ players have longer careers than some years ago , ’ added @entity20			1
‘ i had @entity132 ( at @entity136 ) in his last years as well and he was very good			0
‘ the top players know how to do it			2
they know best every time they have the ball			0
’ timing , as the 256 goals he has scored in his professional career with @entity150 , @entity151 , @entity26 and @entity10 , is everything			2
he has also proved , that managed correctly , it is possible to stretch a career at the very highest level into the mid-thirties			0
this is a problem for @entity158 at @entity159 as he works out a way to get the best from the captain @entity137 at the age of 34			0
rotation and rest is the answer			0
@entity7 accepts that his days as a nailed on starter are over and yet he continues to make an impact whenever he plays			2
it is only a matter of time before @entity10 ’s supporters strike up the tune : ‘ @entity7 we want you to stay ’ for a man they voted the club ’s player of the month in september			1
you just know , judging by the smile on @entity7 ’s face when he arrowed his effort beyond the reach of @entity28 keeper @entity69 , how much he loves this sport			1
there should be more built like him			0
he enjoys working with @entity20 and is known to be quite taken with the management methods of @entity10 ’s coach			2
@entity7 has responded to his relaxed , yet thorough , style			2
‘ @entity7 is not only a top player but a great profession and person , ’ added @entity20			1
‘ he ’s very happy here and he also enjoys the way we play			0
‘ he makes a difference in the last 25 - 30 minutes and we ’re very happy with him			0
’ after this , they just need to work out a way to break the bad news to his @entity197 .			0

@entity7 scored second goal in 3 - 0 win against @entity28
the loan star is *scheduled* to join @entity12 on *january* 7
