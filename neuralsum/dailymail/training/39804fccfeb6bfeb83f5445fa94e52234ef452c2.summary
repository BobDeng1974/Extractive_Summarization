@entity0 says @entity2 ’ players ca n’t use the latest bout of turmoil at @entity5 as an excuse for failure			1
facing a trip to @entity10 in their quest to peg back @entity12 , preparations were interrupted by news of caretaker manager @entity15 ’s resignation in midweek			1
just weeks after @entity17 was placed on gardening leave , @entity15 ’s decision added to the steady drip of negativity enveloping a dressing room where players ca n’t even be certain they will be paid on schedule next week			1
defender @entity23 has urged players to forget about the unrest at @entity5 @entity0 insists the squad must focus on their jobs , winning football matches ‘ we could sit here and go : “ the gaffer ’s gone and now @entity15 might be going , the off - field antics ” , you could write a big massive list , ’ said defender @entity0 , ‘ but at the end of the day what ’s the point ? ‘ we ’re getting paid to play football and to win matches so that ’s what we need to concentrate on			1
‘ i ’d be lying if i said that sometimes it does n’t swirl around in the back of your head			2
of course it does because it ’s human nature , but you try and block it out as much as you can and get on with your job			2
‘ obviously , it was a bit of a body blow , but you just deal with it			2
@entity15 came in on tuesday and we had a wee discussion about it and cleared the air and that ’s it , you move on			2
the @entity2 players train ahead of saturday 's trip to @entity10 in the @entity57 @entity0 ( centre ) trains on friday with @entity59 ( left ) and @entity60 ‘ in any walk of life you get ups and downs and football is no different			1
in football it ’s maybe intensified a bit			2
over the past year or so here it ’s maybe intensified , too , because of what ’s happened on and off the park			2
i just concentrate on the objective which is to win on a saturday and everything else you just put the blinkers on			1
’ a former @entity10 player , @entity0 knows what to expect in @entity76 this afternoon			1
what no one can predict with any real accuracy is the impact @entity15 ’s departure will have on a @entity2 team already playing catch - up with @entity12			1
dismissing suggestions players will ease off the pedal after learning their manager has no plans to hang around , @entity0 insisted : ‘ definitely not			1
it ’s not in my character			0
i ’m pretty sure with the group of boys we have in that dressing room , that ’s not going to be the case			0
if anything , we ’ll be pressing harder on the pedal just to try and prove a point knowing other people have been thinking we ’ll falter			0
rangers are currently 13 points behind league leaders @entity12 going into saturday 's match ‘ it might make it a wee bit more difficult , but coming to a club like @entity2 , it ’s difficult at the best of times , so you just get on with it			1
’ beyond @entity10 , the latest indignities to strike the club could hardly be described as the perfect preparation for a @entity114 semi-final against @entity116 next weekend			1
‘ i can agree with that , ’ said @entity0 , ‘ but we can only control what ’s in our spectrum , turning up and applying ourselves in training and in games			1
everything else we need to block it out like the professionals we are			0
you need to block out the negativity			0
you can probably use it for motivation or just totally ignore it and i tend to do that			0
‘ if you look for faults and pessimism , you ’ll find it			0
for me , i just get on with it			0
we had tuesday and wednesday with @entity15 and our day off yesterday , so nothing was discussed			0
it ’s just one of these things			0
i totally respect how the gaffer is feeling , but we still have a job to do and i ’m sure he ’ll be no different			0
when he crosses the line in training he ’ll still be the @entity15 we know			0
