it 's all @entity1 's fault ; him and the good folk of @entity4 or , at least , @entity2			2
it is a simplification , of course , but perhaps a useful way of understanding why , as we survey the @entity10 quarter finals , there are no @entity14 clubs troubling the scorers			1
@entity16 take on @entity17 on wednesday night and even though they are contending with an injury crisis which leaves them without @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22 among others you might anticipate a sixth @entity10 semi-final for @entity1 in his six years of management			1
of course @entity1 is n't alone responsible for the decline of the @entity14 in @entity28 ; nor is it really down to @entity2 , though the iconic town with its genteel ambience played its part in continental @entity28 overhauling the @entity34 clubs			1
@entity1 prepares his side for their @entity10 quarter - final first leg against @entity17 the @entity16 boss gives instructions to his goalkeeper @entity39 at a training session on tuesday something happened back in 2008 when @entity1 took over at @entity42 and it was n't that the @entity42 team changed			1
@entity44 had virtually the same players but @entity1 managed to find an extra 25 per cent of performance in them			2
what happened was a tactical change which had at its roots in @entity2 , where the @entity42 team spent their first pre season under @entity1			2
there @entity51 was a distracted individual , sometimes sneering at @entity1 's insistence on organisation and pressing , according to @entity56 's account in his biographies of @entity51 and @entity1			1
but a breakthrough came when @entity1 stuck up for @entity51 in his battle with the club to play for @entity61 in the @entity62			1
the new manager took the young @entity64 under his wing , sidling up to him after training , putting his arm round him to assure him of his support			0
@entity1 is bidding to reach his sixth @entity10 semi-final in his six years as a manager @entity1 got @entity51 on side in 2008 after standing up for him in battle to represent @entity61 at the @entity62 @entity51 , the precocious star , suddenly felt he had an ally in @entity74			1
and , as a result , he began to buy into @entity1 's idea of relentless pressing to supplement the tiki taka football , which was already a template at @entity42			1
for tiki taka is not what made @entity1 ’s team great			0
' i loathe all that passing for the sake of it , all that tiki - taka			0
it 's rubbish and has no purpose			0
' it sounds like @entity88 , but those are the words of the great high priest of possession football as reported by @entity92 in his book @entity94			0
what @entity1 added to @entity42 ’s game was the intensity , drive and sheer energy which had wilted under @entity44 and then moulded it with overwhelming possession			1
sometimes , when assessing the @entity34 problem in @entity28 , it helps to reverse the question			0
so , rather than ask ' why are we so bad now ? ' it useful to identify why were we so good between 2005 - 2009 ? ' @entity1 led @entity42 to @entity10 glory in 2009 and 2011 ( pictured ) the former @entity42 manager is thrown into the air by his players as they celebrate the 2011 success for @entity113 fans pointing to the 2012 triumph , that it was indeed a victory of rare courage amidst adversity but the decline of @entity34 clubs had already begun and that win is effectively an outlier , bucking the established trend			1
between 2005 - 2009 the @entity14 provided 12 out of the potential 20 semi finalists for the @entity10 ; between 2010 to 2015 it has provided three out of 24			1
even asking that question is revealing as what @entity34 clubs were really good at during that period was making the semi finals and the final rather than winning the trophy			0
only @entity129 and @entity130 actually achieved that in the five - year period of @entity34 ascendancy , though , of course , @entity113 did so improbably in 2012			0
what was different about @entity34 clubs in that period was the injection of some of the finest tactical minds in the game to the @entity14			2
@entity139 may never have won the trophy with @entity113 but he transformed their approach and arguably provided the foundations for the 2008 final and the remarkable 2012 win			0
@entity144 was an extraordinary force , the @entity146 of that era , regularly out - witting @entity139 and taking a relatively normal @entity129 team to two finals			0
@entity150 engineered a fine run to the semi finals building on the work of @entity139			0
@entity130 won the @entity10 in 2008 when @entity34 clubs were dominating the latter stages @entity113 were an exception to the rule in 2012 when they won the tournament against all the odds rising to the challenge of @entity139 and @entity144 , sir @entity159 was tactically at his peak in that period , playing without a recognised centre foward at times in 2008 before @entity1 and others made it fashionable			1
@entity34 teams had always had an intensity with which continental teams had sometimes struggled to cope			2
what they had lacked often was organisation and tactical nous			0
@entity144 , @entity139 , @entity150 provided that and @entity159 responded			0
put all that together and you have a cultural melting pot which , allied to the commercial success of the @entity14 , was pushing players and teams to new heights			0
the @entity14 ’s tv money of course brought in good , technical foreign players which helped but that does not seem to be the key reason for its success			2
the money is bigger now and those players still come but it has n't helped @entity189			0
at the zenith of the @entity14 's dominance , the 2008 @entity192 final , ten @entity34 players started the game			2
@entity189 were eliminated in the last 16 this season at the hands of @entity42 @entity113 exited at the same stage as @entity199 have no representatives in the quarter - finals when @entity203 spoke about the tactical revolution he was attempting to forge in @entity205 in 2006 - a style of play which has since evolved at @entity208 and @entity16 - he explicitly referenced the @entity14 and its pace			1
he recognised that continental @entity28 had fallen behind			0
it was new tactical ideas meeting the traditional attributes of the @entity34 game which helped the @entity14 dominate @entity28			2
conversely , it was @entity1 - and others , such as @entity216 , @entity217 , @entity218 - surpassing that intensity which in turn overhauled the @entity14			1
clubs such as @entity42 , @entity16 , @entity208 have retained their technical superiority over @entity34 clubs but they are now likely to out - run them and out - press them			1
in reality there is no one man responsible for that change			0
and , @entity1 's obsession with pressing is rooted in an admiration for @entity231 and especially @entity232 , rather than the @entity14			1
but when that change took place , the @entity14 lost its competitive edge			0
and when @entity1 put his arm around @entity51 at @entity2 back in the summer of 2008 and convinced his young protege to buy into that pressing game , @entity239 football changed forever .			1

@entity16 take on @entity17 in the @entity10 quarter - final
@entity1 bidding to reach sixth semi-final in sixth year as a manager
from 2005 - 2009 @entity199 had 12 out of 20 @entity10 **semi-finalists**
in last five years only three **semi-finalists** have been from @entity14
@entity1 changed @entity42 tactically , introducing relentless pressing
@entity51 brought into it when @entity1 supported him against the club
@entity14 clubs have struggled to cope with that intensity in @entity28
