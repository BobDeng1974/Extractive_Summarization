my father 's death made me stronger ... he was my hero and i know i 'm making him proud play for @entity3 in the @entity4 ? i need to learn how to play union first ! i hung up on @entity6 the first time he called @entity8 admitted his first union passed ' in a blur ' after helping @entity11 to an all - important bonus - point win that reignited their @entity14 campaign			1
the 25 - year - old , making his first start since switching codes in october , looked lost at times but still made several telling contributions – three of which led to penalties for his side - as @entity22 ’s 78th minute try secured the bonus - point that moved @entity11 into second place in @entity25 ahead of @entity26 , who play @entity28 on saturday afternoon			1
following two cameo appearances from the bench , the @entity11 faithful finally got their chance to see the 6ft 5in , 18st 5lb star in action from the start			1
he completed the full 80 minutes at inside centre and will have learned immeasurably more from playing a live match than all the training drills in the world could achieve			0
@entity8 runs in behind @entity40 ( right ) after making his first start for @entity11 in their defeat of @entity43 @entity8 is still learning his trade , especially in defence , after crossing codes from rugby league @entity11 players celebrate victory that reignites their hopes of qualifying from their @entity53 pool @entity11 : @entity54 ; @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity8 , @entity57 ; @entity40 , @entity58 ; @entity59 ( capt ) , @entity61 , @entity62 , day , @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66			1
replacements : @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity22			2
@entity43 : @entity75 ; @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 ; @entity80 , @entity81 ; @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity86 , @entity87 ( capt ) , @entity89 , @entity90			2

‘ i do n’t want to say i ’m disappointed but it ’s clear i ’ve got a lot of things to work on , ’ @entity8 said			2
‘ i felt ok but there ’s a lot of things i can get better at			0
there ’s no hiding from that			0
there are a lot of different aspects of the game i ’m enjoying learning			0
i ’m pleased to get that full 80 minutes but it felt a bit of a blur at times			0
’ @entity8 ’s three - quarter partner @entity57 scored a hat - trick of tries as @entity11 dominated their opponents for the second week running			1
but there was no doubt it was the former @entity121 the 13,282 strong crowd had come to see			0
‘ @entity8 ’s on the right track and he ’ll have learned an unbelievable amount from playing a full 80 minutes , ’ said @entity11 head coach @entity123			1
‘ spending all week in at 12 he ’ll have learned more than the whole time he ’s been here			2
‘ it ’ll be a couple of months before you see the real @entity8			2
but what he ’s done so far has been fantastic			0
we ’re ready for all the criticism but we know what we ’re doing			0
’ @entity57 ( right ) races away to score @entity11 's opening try at the @entity136 @entity57 races down the wing to score his second try against the under - par @entity141 side @entity11 wing @entity57 crosses the line for his third and final try of the game it will inevitably take the man recently described as the ‘ greatest rugby league forward on the planet ’ time to adapt to his new code			1
he made enough significant contributions against admittedly underwhelming @entity141 opponents to suggest he can make the grade			0
occasionally he looked lost defensively			0
he carried like an ox and made a string of thumping tackles			0
‘ for me @entity8 needs to be in the pack , ’ @entity40 added			2
‘ the plan was to put him in the back row in the last 20 but the game was too tight he looked lost in defence a couple of times but he did some really good things			0
’ @entity8 ’s last start in rugby league saw him fracture his cheekbone seconds into the @entity168 , only to play on and secure the man - of - the - match award , and a place in @entity172 sporting folklore in the process			1
@entity8 made an immediate impact on friday night , albeit fortuitously , when he failed to gather a pass from @entity176 only for the ball ricocheted off his hip and into the waiting @entity57 ’s hands , who scuttled in from 30 meters			1
@entity57 ( centre ) and @entity8 ( centre left ) charge through the @entity43 centre @entity3 newcomer @entity185 takes one of several successful kicks during the game @entity8 has been described as @entity11 's ' enforcer ' by head coach @entity123 television replays suggested @entity66 ’s pass may have been forward but the try was awarded and @entity11 , and @entity8 , were on their way as @entity40 converted			1
moments later @entity8 was involved again when he carried powerfully through the middle and earned his side a penalty as @entity43 ’s forwards dived over the top of the ball			1
there was brief concern as the @entity205 player of the year winced in pain and squinted while holding the left side of his face – which contains four steel plates following extensive surgery in october which delayed his union introduction			0
but it proved a false alarm			0
@entity185 slotted the ensuing penalty before @entity57 scored his second try of the night courtesy of a superbly worked set piece move which used @entity8 as a decoy runner only for the @entity11 fly - half to flip the ball behind his centre to blindside winger @entity55 who fed @entity56 and onto the giant winger			1
@entity185 made it 17 - 0 midway through the first half and @entity11 continued to dominate the rest of the half without adding to their points tally			2
@entity22 races away to score @entity11 's fourth try and earn an all - important bonus point @entity22 dives over to help @entity11 move above @entity26 into second place in their pool @entity11 lost @entity3 lock @entity63 with a shoulder injury before the break with @entity71 replacing him			1
‘ i do n’t think @entity63 ’s injury is too bad , ’ said @entity40			0
@entity185 kicked his second penalty on 43 minutes as @entity11 moved into a 20 point lead			1
@entity57 chalked up his third try of the night on 52 minutes – which also saw @entity43 replacement @entity241 shown a yellow card for a dangerous tackle – before the visitors scored two consolation tries before @entity22 ’s telling last contribution .			1

@entity11 defeated @entity43 *32* - 12 in their @entity53 clash on friday
@entity8 impressed on his first start for the club since crossing codes
winger @entity57 scored a hat - trick of tries as the hosts dominated
@entity22 ’s late try secured a bonus point that moved them to second
