' there 's a part of me that feels somewhat bored by all of this			2
' but @entity2 said that a recent analyst report that @entity4 would have gone the way of former internet titans such as @entity25 by 2020 was wide of the mark			1
' @entity4 is such a basic utility			1
it 's something that is such a part of peoples ' lives , i think it 's hard to imagine it going away , ' said the billionaire tech investor , one of the driving forces behind online music company @entity37			2
@entity2 spoke out this week as he launched an app designed to use @entity4 's store of knowledge about people to enable online video chat with people they might like - @entity3			1
the app will operate within @entity4			1

so @entity68 could see the billionaire @entity4 founder when he popped up using the chat - a - stranger feature			1
' i was still figuring it out , it was my first ‘ random ’ airtime chat , ' mr. @entity88 told @entity92			0

after like 30 seconds he nexted me			0
' when users no longer want to talk to the person they are chatting with – they press the @entity97 button to speak to someone new			0
