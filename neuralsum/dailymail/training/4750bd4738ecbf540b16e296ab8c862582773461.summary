the @entity1 's sailors will be waiting a little longer to don their bold new ' fashion statement ' uniforms - complete with @entity5 - style baseball caps - after the first batch arrived mouldy			1
the new uniforms , first tested back in 2012 , were supposed to begin being rolled out this month , but the first order for 1,700 ' combat number 4 dress ' were unwearable			2
it is thought the uniforms had been steam cleaned , but not dried properly			2
the new uniform is designed to be ' easy - to - wear ' , with @entity14 replacing buttons , zip - up boots instead of laces - and an @entity5 - style baseball cap a @entity1 source told @entity20 : ' there were plans to roll it out from the start of january			1
the first batch was completely ruined and unusable			0
it 's all rather embarrassing really and an unwanted delay			0
' the uniform replaces the @entity1 ’s traditional lighter blue outfit and is the first new uniform to be worn by our sailors on operations for more than 20 years			1
the new kit , which is being manufactured by a @entity35 company as part of a £ 250,000 deal , is designed to be more versatile and adaptable to the different weather that the @entity1 encounters as it carries out its worldwide operations			0
but when the uniforms were unveiled two years ago , traditionalists were horrified to see @entity1 sailors would soon be wearing @entity5 - style baseball caps on operations			1
the @entity46 ( @entity46 ) said at the time the caps were ' cool and more modern '			0
the new uniforms also replaced buttons with @entity14 , and zip - up boots with fake laces			1
but when the order for 1,700 uniforms arrived , they were unwearable			2
it is thought they had been steam cleaned but not dried properly before being packaged the @entity46 went as far as to say the uniforms were a ' daring fashion statement ' - a play on words based around @entity62 , the £ 1billion type 45 destroyer where combat number 4 dress was trialed			1
all 190 officers and crew were wearing the new uniform , with even the warship 's commander captain @entity68 opting to wear the baseball cap on the bridge during counter-piracy operations in the @entity73			0
formal uniforms will continue to be worn , however , at official dinners and ceremonial occasions			0
however , this set back in the planned roll out is only a temporary , with a @entity1 spokesman saying it was still full steam ahead			2
the spokesman said : ' we continue to work closely with our supplier in delivering this improved uniform , the majority of seagoing and operational units will be wearing the improved uniform by the end of july 2015			0
