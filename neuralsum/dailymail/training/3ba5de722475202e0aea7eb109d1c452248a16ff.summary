the @entity6 granted archaeologists from the @entity7 permission to decide where the body should be buried after their unexpected discovery of the @entity2 king 's body			1
but the group of fifteen living relatives has objected to the plans and are expected to launch an application for judicial review of the @entity6 's decision to grant the licence to the academics			1
the debate over the king 's final resting place has been propelled by the significant tourism boost that will inevitably be attached to the location			1

but the campaigners have argued that @entity10 would have wanted a burial in @entity52 cathedral			0
an application for judicial review is to be lodged by lawyers on behalf of the family group , known as the @entity2			1
the family will argue that the @entity6 failed to consult them over the terms of the burial licence , claiming that this was a breach of the right to family life under article 8 of the @entity65			1
a petition calling for @entity10 to be re-interred in @entity52 has been signed by more than 23,000 people , while a similar petition backing a @entity7 burial has attracted below 8,000 signatures			2
final resting place : the remains are expected to be interred in @entity40 in may next year , with a large memorial service alternative : the @entity2 argue that the remains should be buried in @entity52 cathedral tomb : the @entity41 , which was behind the excavation along with the @entity7 team , has proposed a simple tomb an exhibition centre has been earmarked by @entity82 for a @entity84 building overlooking the car park where the king 's body was unceremoniously buried after being killed by @entity89 's troops			1
after his naked body was brought back battle on the back of a horse , his remains were buried in a shallow grave without a coffin on the site of what was once @entity100			0
dna tests from one of the monarch 's closest living relatives , a furniture maker from @entity106 living in @entity107 , were used to confirm the remains were those of the monarch			2
@entity111 himself has supported the @entity7 burial plans , despite opposition from the other group of distant relatives			1
memorial : a stone referring to @entity10 at @entity40 , where the recently discovered remains are planned to be interred @entity119 , a 16th great - nephew of the monarch and member of the @entity2 , said : ' we have every hope that ( we ) will succeed in our quest to have @entity10 's remains buried at the most appropriate site , @entity52			1
' @entity127 , from @entity130 - based law firm @entity128 , said : ' we have now written officially to the @entity6 and @entity7 , notifying them that we plan to issue these claims			1
' we will follow up by issuing the judicial review and other proceedings as soon as possible , but certainly within the next few weeks			2
' @entity10 grew up at @entity135 in the @entity136 and visited @entity52 several times during his 26 - month reign			0
known as @entity138 before his coronation , he also funded part of the city 's medieval gated walls			0
the monarch 's links with the area are celebrated to this day , with a @entity146 in @entity135 , a @entity136 - made @entity10 wensleydale cheese and a @entity148 in @entity52			0
but the @entity7 disputed the group 's grounds for judicial review			1

the statement read : ' our decision was , and remains , that @entity10 should be reinterred at @entity40			0
' the plan for reinterment in @entity40 was clearly stated and unambiguous at the start of the project and announced in a statement on friday august 24 2012			0
this was before the dig started			0
' @entity167 on the nearest consecrated ground is in keeping with good archaeological practice			0
@entity10 has lain in the shadow of @entity171 , @entity7 , for over 500 years			0
' the group added that @entity82 initially gave permission for the excavation on the basis that the body would be buried at the nearby cathedral			0
remains : the skeleton found under @entity100 car park in @entity7 which was eventually found to be that of @entity10 reconstruction : the world 's only facial reconstruction of @entity10 unveiled 528 years after his death by @entity186 , originator of the ' @entity189 ' project they also refuted the group 's right to be described as family members , saying : ' @entity10 is believed to have no living descendants			1
any distant relations are therefore descended from his siblings			0

' ' there is no obligation to consult living relatives where remains are older than 100 years			2
' the university also referred to a statement from @entity52 made in february supporting the monarch 's reburial in @entity7			2
