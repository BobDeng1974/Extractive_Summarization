president @entity0 has refrained from picking favorites in the race to succeed him and paid vice president @entity4 a strong compliment without issuing anything close to an endorsement			1
‘ i 've got somebody who i think will go down as one of the finest vice presidents in history , and he has been , as i said earlier , a great partner in everything that i do , ’ @entity0 said in an interview with @entity9 released thursday			2
the president will continue to walk a proverbial tightrope for the near future as all eyes are cast on @entity18 , waiting to see if the former secretary of state decides to formally announce her second presidential bid			2
looking for the handoff : vice president @entity4 has not decided whether or not he will run for president in 2016 but @entity0 has refused to take the normal move of endorsing his number two ( pictured together on wednesday ) ‘ i suspect that there may be other potential candidates for 2016 who have been great friends and allies			1
i know that we 've got an extraordinary secretary of state who did great service for us and worked with me and @entity4 to help make the country safer , ’ @entity0 said			1
‘ whoever the @entity34 standard bearer is going to be continuing to focus on jobs , making sure that our kids our getting a great education , making sure that we 're rebuilding prosperity from the middle class out in country , and i am very much interested in making sure that some of the stuff we 've gotten started continues			0
’ @entity46 is widely seen as the @entity34 frontrunner in 2016 and has been trouncing @entity4 in both the early polls and early fundraising efforts			2
in spite of @entity46 ’s hefty lead - the latest @entity53 poll completed tuesday has @entity46 beating @entity4 by 53 per cent in the race for the @entity34 nomination - has not deterred @entity4 from keeping the door open for his third presidential run			2
he has repeatedly said that he has not decided on his 2016 prospects , rotating his answers between saying that he will decide after the midterms , he has n’t been focusing on it , or leaving the final decision to his wife @entity63			0
close : @entity4 put up a selfie of himself and @entity0 from inside ' the @entity65 ' on wednesday ‘ there is nothing i would do differently if i absolutely knew i was n't going to run or i absolutely knew i was , ’ @entity4 said most recently			1
the president ’s decision to hedge his bets in the @entity9 interview does not come as a massive surprise to political analysts , as this is just the latest in a string of signs that he is staying close with @entity46 even after she left his administration			0
one of the most telling moments came shortly after he was sworn into office for a second term , when he chose to have @entity46 by his side for the first televised interview of the term rather than his running mate , @entity4			0
according to a lengthy @entity88 profile of ' @entity89 ' that ran in february , trouble began brewing during the 2012 re-election campaign as there were rumors that the @entity0 team was considering replacing @entity4 with then - outgoing - secretary of state @entity18			1
eye on the prize : @entity18 has a massive lead in the race for the @entity34 presidential nomination for 2016 and she has been doing little to tamper expectations that she is running ( pictured at a @entity100 event last week ) when questioned about it by @entity4 , all involved parties denied any truth to said rumor and said so publicly , but not as forcefully as @entity4 wanted			1
not only were they not being as strong in their denials as @entity4 wanted , they were also lying			0
there was some truth to the speculation as pollsters from the campaign had begun slipping in questions about what the public would think if @entity46 was brought in as number two			0
for her part , @entity46 has not done anything to tamper the mounting speculation , launching a speaking tour and repeating how she hopes that - while she has n’t decided what her next formal role witll be- there will be a female president within her lifetime .			0

@entity0 said that he ' suspect ( s ) that there may be other potential candidates who have been great friends and allies '
goes on to specifically mention his ' extraordinary ' former secretary of state , @entity18 , who has a wide lead in the 2016 race already
@entity4 has said that he has n't formally decided if he is going to run but will make that decision later in the year after the midterm elections
