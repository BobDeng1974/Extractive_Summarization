once one of @entity4 ’s most majestic country houses , the future of this historic hall looks grim as vital restoration costs reach £ 35million			1
grand plans for the 180 - year - old @entity6 , in @entity6 near @entity7 , @entity8 are at a standstill because of the latest economic recession , leaving them to decay after they were named on @entity15 ’s ‘ at risk ’ register			1
planning permission to turn the dilapidated building into a conference hotel has been given the green light but the cost of repairs are too high for developer @entity23			1
@entity50 , the @entity8 regional director at @entity23 , said that much money had been spent in maintaining the site from further deterioration			1
after a restoration of the gardens in 2003 , the estate was re-opened in 2004 and now attracts some three million visitors every year			1
he said of the @entity60 - listed buildings : ‘ we have planning approvals for the restoration of @entity6 but the cost of doing so is significantly greater than its current value			1
plans to develop the buildings of @entity6 are at a standstill after developer @entity23 says £ 35m restoration costs are too expensive to build the planned conference hotel @entity60 - listed heritage : dr @entity71 , from @entity15 said of @entity73 - listed buildings are the bulk of the nation 's heritage treasury so when one of them is lost , it is as though someone has rubbed out a bit of the past ' garden 's revival : while some of the buildings languish , the spectacular gardens were recently refurbished and replanted with thousands of plants and flowers to return it to its former glory costly country views : many millions of pounds have been spent on the estate since it was bought by @entity23 in 1996 , when it was in such a state that both the buildings and extensive gardens were derelict and vandalised ‘ to restore and rebuild it would cost around £ 30 - £ 35million , but the current value as a hotel is well below that			1
therefore , it is just not economically viable in the current economy			0
' developing the hall was planned for five to ten years after we started the restoration but we have had somewhat of a recession in the last few years and this has delayed the plans completely			2
' we are looking to see if there are ways of making the scheme work financially			0
the plan of a major conference centre is particularly expensive and difficult to market			0
' we are committed to bringing the hall back to life , it 's just a question of when we can make the numbers work			2
' @entity121 plans : sir @entity122 spent more than 10 years , making improvements to the house adding a new block with state bedrooms complete with dressing rooms and its own servants ' quarters as well as the sculpture gallery and the clock tower demolition : the lake in the estate became polluted by sewage from local potteries around the 1900s and it was offered for free to the local councils in 1905 but by 1907 it stood abandoned and so the bulk of the estate was demolished in 1912 mr @entity50 said a recent report from the local council into the estate found that ' great progress ' had been made in the restoration work so far			1
dr @entity71 , chief executive of @entity15 , said : ‘ @entity60 - listed buildings are the bulk of the nation 's heritage treasury so when one of them is lost , it is as though someone has rubbed out a bit of the past			1
‘ something that made the area special will have gone			0
but now , with the economic climate putting more pressure than ever on these buildings , it is time to plug the one remaining gap			2
