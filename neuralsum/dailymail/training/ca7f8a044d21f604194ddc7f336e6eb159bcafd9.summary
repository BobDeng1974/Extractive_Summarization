by @entity0 published : 05:56 est , 8 october 2012 updated : 09:37 est , 8 october 2012 when @entity2 took up netball , the idea was to get fit and do something for herself			1
she never imagined it would end up saving her life			2
after embarking on an impressive fitness regimen of netball , running and swimming and losing four stone , the mother - of - four discovered a small lump			1
mrs @entity2 , 46 , from @entity13 , decided to get it checked by a doctor - and was diagnosed with breast cancer			1
she was told that had she not slimmed down , she would never have spotted the 1cm lump			0
fighting fit : @entity2 lost four stone playing netball			1
she then discovered a cancerous lump in her breast that doctors say would have gone undetected had she still been overweight mrs @entity2 had not done much sport since school before suddenly taking the decision to get fit about 18 months ago			1
she said : ' i do think everything happens for a reason			0
what on @entity30 made me think after 30 years i ’m going to get fit ? ' i did n’t do anything before			1
but three of the children were at school and did n’t need picking up and dropping off			0
changing habits : mrs @entity2 had not exercised in 30 years until she took up netball , running and swimming ' i was a bit bored and thought i would just do something			1
' she went to netball , started swimming with her son who had recently left the @entity43 and took up running			1
her consultant explained her out - of - the - blue decision to take up the sport was lucky because it meant her cancer was caught early			1
mrs @entity2 said : ' when i saw the lump near my armpit i went to the doctor			1
i 'd had lumps before that had been nothing			0
' then everything happened so quickly			0
you go from not thinking about cancer to meeting the cancer nurse and deciding whether you are going to have a lumpectomy or a mastectomy			1
' the lump was removed during surgery at @entity64 , @entity13 , last december			0
mercifully , the cancer had not spread			1
mrs @entity2 then underwent a month of radiotherapy and will take medication every day for the next five years			1
her consultant told her she was lucky to have lost the weight at such a vital time			1
' apparently i would never have seen the lump before i lost the weight , because it was tiny			2
i did n’t feel it but spotted it in the mirror when i got out of the shower			0
' it was only 1cm big , so i certainly would not have seen it so soon otherwise			0
' now the classroom assistant plays netball , swims more than 800 lengths and runs the equivalent of more than a marathon every week			2
she even continued her regimen even when having radiotherapy treatment in march			2
she said : ' apart from the two weeks off after the operation i have done the same thing pretty much every day			0
' i wanted cancer to be the smallest part of my life			2
' netball is fantastic because you are doing it with other people from all walks of life and you get a camaraderie you do n’t really get on your own with swimming and running			2
' i always loved netball at school and i am quite competitive			2
it ’s fun and it ’s for everybody			0
we ’ve got teenage girls up to women in their 60s			0
' i went back a couple of weeks after my operation and could take it at my own pace			0
' ' and when i was having treatment it was good to know i was going to see my friends and have a game			0
' mrs @entity2 has now completed the @entity113 and @entity114 with her husband @entity115 this year			1
she has also taken part in the @entity117 twice			0
she said : “ when i started running everyone laughed but i gradually got more and more into it			0
' and then i nagged @entity115 to come out with me and now we pretty much always run together			2
' october is @entity121 month .			0

@entity2 took up exercise for the first time in 30 years
weight loss meant the cancer was detected early and still treatable
continued to play netball , swim and run while *undergoing* *chemotherapy*
