by @entity0 , @entity1 former @entity2 and @entity4 striker @entity3 is confident @entity5 is ready for the challenge of being a @entity8 player			1
@entity4 are trying to sign 18 - year - old @entity9 defender @entity5 , who has been included in @entity2 boss @entity11 's squad for this summer 's @entity12			1
the left - back already has over 50 @entity15 starts and a senior international cap to his name			1
making a move ? @entity9 full - back @entity5 ( right ) has attracted the attention of the @entity15 's top clubs including @entity4 and when asked about the prospect of @entity5 joining @entity4 , @entity3 , who made such a memorable impact at the @entity26 as an 18 - year - old , said : ' i think it 's always good to keep progressing up the ladder and to play at the highest standard			1
' and once you have had the experience that @entity5 has had in the @entity15 , i think you are certainly ready for that challenge now			0
' having had the first - team experience he has , and now going to a @entity12 , i 'd say he is more than ready to join a really big club - if @entity9 let him go			2
' should the move to @entity4 go through this summer , @entity5 will be joining at an interesting time for the club			1
incoming : current @entity43 boss @entity42 , seen here in training with the @entity47 national team , is expected to take over at @entity4 after the @entity48 which way to go : @entity9 boss @entity50 could also depart @entity9 with @entity51 interested in the @entity53 's services the @entity8 are set to undergo considerable change as they look to bounce back from a disappointing 2013/14 season following the retirement of boss sir @entity57 , with a permanent replacement - @entity42 , it seems - for @entity57 's successor @entity59 coming in and the squad being overhauled			1
@entity3 feels the @entity5 transfer would be a good one for all parties concerned			2
' @entity4 have obviously had a poor campaign by their standards and we talk about rebuilding , but it has only been one season - there is still an awful lot of quality there , ' the 34 - year - old said			2
' they are a huge club with a huge stadium , and i presume they are going to get a huge manager as well			0
' i would n't have thought they will be coming seventh again next season , put it that way - i think they will be right back in the mix. ' but they are going to have to buy quality players like @entity5 , and particularly in defence , because they have lost @entity86 and @entity87 , and there is talk about @entity90 as well			2
' they are going to be hard to replace , but someone like @entity5 would go a long way towards that			0
' so the only losers would be @entity9 - but then again , i 'm pretty sure there will be a huge fee involved ! ' takes one to know one : former @entity4 @entity4 striker @entity3 believes @entity5 could become a star at the @entity8 the future : @entity5 made his @entity2 debut against @entity102 earlier this year , and @entity3 tips the @entity2 ' youngsters to shine at the @entity12 star in the making : a teenage @entity3 took the @entity12 by storm for @entity2 at @entity108 ' 98 @entity5 is part of a 23 - man @entity2 @entity12 squad that has plenty more youth in it , with the likes of @entity113 and @entity114 also included			1
while approving of @entity11 's selection and pleased it features several younger players , @entity3 has also been keen to stress he believes those chosen have been on merit , regardless of their age			0
and he is feeling positive about what the group can achieve at the tournament in @entity125			0
he said : ' i think a lot of the players we will be pinning our hopes on are youngsters - and that is maybe just a coincidence			0
' they have all come off a great season for their clubs , are full of confidence , and i 'm hoping one or two of them will star in this tournament			0
' i think @entity2 are going to surprise a few - i think we could do well			0
