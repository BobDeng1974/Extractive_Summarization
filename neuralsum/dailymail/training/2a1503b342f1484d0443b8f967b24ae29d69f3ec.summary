we hope that this will finally lead to her being found and to the discovery of whoever is responsible for this crime , ’ they said in a statement			0
the new investigation will work with @entity42 ’s multi-million - pound inquiry into @entity25 ’s disappearance , which was the subject of a major appeal on @entity47 ’s @entity46 programme last week			1

@entity8 police said yesterday that their own review team had been working since march 2011 to reassess files from the original investigation and this process had uncovered new leads			1
a well - placed source told the @entity66 they could be ‘ highly significant ’			2
authorities have put a secrecy order on the new material , banning it from being made public , but @entity8 law states that unsolved cases can be reopened only when there is strong new evidence			2

’ earlier this month @entity42 spoke of a possible breakthrough after it emerged that officers were analysing data from the phone records of people who were in @entity51 when @entity25 vanished			1
wanted : e-fits of fair - haired men who may be @entity114 or @entity115 who were seen lurking near the apartment in @entity51 , @entity8 , which @entity2 was snatched from			1
police launched an appeal on @entity114 television last week after a @entity46 appeal			1
detectives believe the two efits could be the same person prime suspect : these e-fits are of the man seen carrying a child 500 yards from the @entity49 ' holiday apartment in @entity51 , @entity8 officers said they had identified 41 ‘ persons of interest ’ , including several @entity133 people , who were in @entity8 at the time			1
they also released new e-fits , including images of a man seen near the @entity49 ’ holiday flat carrying a girl in pyjamas			0
yard boss sir @entity141 said this week that his force now has the ‘ best chance ’ of solving the mystery			0

in the same week a year before @entity25 was abducted , a thief tried to burgle another apartment in the same resort but fled empty - handed after a toddler screamed			0
and in the three months leading up to her disappearance , there was a four-fold increase in ‘ low - level ’ burglaries at the complex			0
response : after the couple 's appeal on @entity46 ( pictured ) , a number of callers gave names for the man police believe snatched @entity25 new timeline : the @entity46 special revealed that police were now looking at @entity25 's abduction as being at 10pm and not 9.15pm			2
