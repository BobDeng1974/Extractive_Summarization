scientists believe they have finally solved the mystery of the @entity2			1
its identity ? er … a big brown bear			1
dna tests on supposed yeti hair samples have revealed a genetic match with an ancient polar bear			1
scientists believe there could be a sub-species of brown bear in the @entity14 descended from the ancient animal			1
@entity26 , professor of human genetics at @entity28 , set out to collect and test ‘ yeti ’ hair samples to find out which species they came from			2
in particular he analysed hairs from two unknown animals , one found in the @entity36 region of @entity37 and the other from @entity39 , 800 miles to the east			2
after subjecting the hairs to the most advanced dna tests available and comparing the results to other animals ’ genomes stored on the @entity47 database , professor @entity26 found that he had a 100 per cent match with a sample from an ancient polar bear jawbone found in @entity51 , @entity52 , that dates back at least 40,000 years - and probably around 120,000 years - a time when the polar bear and closely related brown bear were separating as different species			1
professor @entity26 believes that the most likely explanation is that the animals are hybrids - crosses between polar bears and brown bears			2
the species are closely related and are known to interbreed where their territories overlap			0
myth or reality ? hairs from two animals found in the @entity22 were a 100 per cent match to an ancient polar bear jaw bone from @entity52 the professor said : ‘ this is an exciting and completely unexpected result that gave us all a surprise			1
there ’s more work to be done on interpreting the results			0
i do n’t think it means there are ancient polar bears wandering around the @entity22			2
‘ but we can speculate on what the possible explanation might be			0
it could mean there is a sub species of brown bear in the @entity14 descended from the bear that was the ancestor of the polar bear			1
or it could mean there has been more recent hybridisation between the brown bear and the descendent of the ancient polar bear			1
’ a photograph of a ‘ yeti ’ footprint , taken by @entity99 climber @entity98 at the base of @entity101 , sparked global mania after it was taken in 1951			0
legendary mountaineer @entity105 , who became the first man to climb @entity101 without oxygen , has studied yetis since he had a terrifying encounter with a mysterious creature in @entity111 in 1986			0
his own research backs up the @entity114 ’ theory			0
he uncovered an image in a 300 - year - old @entity117 manuscript of a ‘ @entity118 ’ - another local name for the yeti , with text alongside it which was translated to read : ‘ the yeti is a variety of bear living in inhospitable mountainous areas			1
’ prof @entity26 added : ‘ @entity131 and other enthusiasts seem to think that they ’ve been rejected by science			0
science does n’t accept or reject anything , all it does is examine the evidence and that is what i ’m doing			0
’ his investigations features in a new three - part @entity138 documentary series , @entity139 , which starts on sunday			0
a book by @entity141 about his research , @entity143 : a dna detective story , is to be published next spring .			0
