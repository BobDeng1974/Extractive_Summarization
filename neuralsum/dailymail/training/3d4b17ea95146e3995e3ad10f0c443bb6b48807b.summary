@entity1 chairman @entity0 will back moves to bring video replays in to help referees for key decisions such as awarding penalties			1
@entity0 is uncertain about @entity9 president @entity8 's idea to allow managers a number of challenges to referees ' decisions but believes video replays should be brought in			1
the @entity1 has a powerful voice as it has one of the eight votes on the @entity19 ( @entity19 ) , the game 's law - making body , along with @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 and @entity9 , which has four votes			1
the @entity19 is due to discuss proposals in march			0
@entity0 agrees with @entity8 that referees should get to use video replays to get decisions right @entity1 chairman @entity0 does n't think a challenge system is the best way forward , unlike the @entity9 proposals @entity0 told @entity33 : ' i for instance would allow a referee to go straight to the cameras [ replay ] for a penalty but you ca n't do that for every decision or the match would never finish			1
' you do n't want to throw the game away - you have seen in rugby where referees hardly make a decision about tries now , that would n't be a good idea for soccer but i do think use of technology should be considered carefully			0
' in 10 years ' time i think we will look back and think " was n't it quaint we did n't use technology to help make certain decisions "			0
' asked about @entity8 's idea for allowing challenges by coaches , @entity0 added : ' i 'm not sure about managers being able to throw in the towel and say ' we want to challenge that '			1
@entity8 has announced his intention to run again as @entity9 president at the age of 79 next year ' i do think the laws on technology will change but it will take time and we have to do it slowly , try certain things and see if it works because you could disrupt the game completely if you are not careful			2
' meanwhile , @entity0 reiterated his view that it is ' a mistake ' for @entity8 to stand for a fifth term in office but did not back the one other person who has said he will stand for @entity9 president , the @entity84 former @entity9 executive @entity83			1
@entity0 said : ' i think it 's a mistake , i do n't think he should be standing			2
he stood last time on the basis that he would not be standing again			0
he is 78 and will be 82 or 83 when the term finishes and it always good to let younger people have their time			0
' the @entity1 would like to see another candidate and a proper competition			0
the @entity1 will decide who it supports at a later stage if we think there is a serious candidate but he [ @entity8 ] is probably going to win if anybody stands anyway			1
' @entity99 were unable to sell out @entity100 against @entity101 and face another low attendance for @entity103 @entity0 also said the pressure that had been building on @entity99 manager @entity105 had been totally lifted by the 2 - 0 win in the @entity108 qualifier in @entity109			1
' you could feel the pressure building up on @entity105 and that one result has killed it			2
it was a very good performance and our younger players played very well in what was the hardest match in the group			0
' we now have a very good chance go to @entity84 with a young side and hopefully do well			0
' @entity0 admitted that @entity99 's next home match against @entity103 would be ' a hard sell ' to fans , but added : ' it would have been a much harder sell if we had not won in @entity109			2
@entity103 's a hard sell at the best of times			0

@entity0 supports replays for officials
but @entity1 chairman *rejects* @entity8 's proposal to give managers challenges
@entity0 fears *football* refereeing could become too much like rugby
@entity1 also opposing @entity8 's attempt to win fifth @entity9 term
@entity105 under less pressure since @entity109 win says @entity0
