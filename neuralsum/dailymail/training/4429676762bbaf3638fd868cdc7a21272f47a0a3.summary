the @entity0 and @entity1 has given its backing to a controversial new @entity4 kit that incorporates the @entity0 emblem within its design			1
the @entity7 apologised on wednesday ' to those who may have taken offence ' over new @entity11 - manufactured shirts - the traditional white jersey and a crimson alternate shirt - featuring @entity0 motifs that comprise numerous small rubber grips to help deaden the impact of the ball			1
@entity19 chairman @entity18 criticised the @entity7 for having had no contact with the organisation over using the emblem , claiming it had ' touched a raw nerve with a lot of people '			1
the @entity0 , the @entity27 and @entity28 armed forces ' most prestigious medal , has only been awarded 1,354 times during its 158 - year existence , most recently in 2012			2
@entity4 players wear the new @entity4 rugby home kit , which has caused controversy over its design @entity4 's players model the alternative red kit they will wear , with @entity0 design on the top half the new white shirt will be worn for the first time when @entity4 kick off their autumn test schedule by hosting world champions @entity41 at @entity42 on november 8			1
but the @entity0 and @entity1 , which was established 52 years ago , has now issued a statement saying it is ' pleased ' that the motif has been used			1
' although the @entity1 was not previously aware of the @entity7 's decision to incorporate the motif , following discussions between the @entity1 and the @entity7 ( and taking account of the statement issued by the @entity7 ) it is clear that the @entity7 did not intend to cause any offence , ' @entity1 chairman - elect major @entity51 said , in the statement			1
' strong links have always existed between the game of rugby and the military			0
' the @entity7 's core values of teamwork , respect , enjoyment , discipline and sportsmanship sit well with the military 's core values of loyalty , integrity , courage , discipline , respect and selfless commitment			2
' given that we , as a nation , are now commemorating the centenary of the @entity73 , and the sacrifices made by so many during that period , the @entity1 feels that the @entity7 's decision to incorporate a @entity78 @entity77 motif within the design of the new @entity4 shirt is a subtle , and fitting , mark of respect for those who went above and beyond			1
' @entity84 wearing the new @entity4 home kit , a uniform now mired in controversy the @entity4 rose badge has moved from the left , pictured , to the centre of their shirts ' we wish to thank the @entity7 for this , and for their continued support for the @entity95 , past , present and future			2
' speaking earlier this week for the @entity19 , which is not affiliated to the @entity0 and @entity98 , @entity97 said : ' using that symbol , you have got to look at it in what context			1
' in the context that they ( @entity7 ) are making money off the selling of the shirts , that 's highly inappropriate			2
' if , for example , they were publicly stating they were supporting the work of the @entity19 and to recognise the bravery of the men that they were going to place the symbol on their shirts for the season and a percentage of the sale of the shirts would go to the @entity19 , that would be appropriate			0
' to that end , i do n't think anyone would have had an issue with it			0
' @entity4 head coach @entity127 , meanwhile , has drawn heavily on @entity4 's rich rugby history to instil a stronger sense of national pride throughout his tenure as head coach			0
@entity127 created the @entity133 , where @entity4 coaches select a winner after every match for the player producing the best defensive performance			0
@entity139 is @entity4 's only rugby international to be awarded the @entity0 , bestowed posthumously after he lost his life in the @entity143 raid of april 1918 in the @entity73			0
@entity144 , meanwhile , launched shirts earlier this year bearing crosses inspired by the @entity1 military medal			0
