as @entity1 serves his latest ban for violent conduct , it will not have escaped the @entity6 hooker ’s notice that @entity7 is in the form of his life			1
fully fit following the shoulder surgery that caused him to miss the autumn internationals , @entity1 ’s nearest rival for the @entity15 no 2 shirt has been outstanding since returning for @entity16 in late november			1
last saturday @entity7 produced a prodigious display as the @entity16 gained revenge for their early - season mauling at the hands of @entity21 — the game in which he suffered a serious dislocation — and in doing so put another international rival , @entity25 , firmly in the shade			1
@entity15 hooker @entity7 is in the form of his life at @entity16 with little over four weeks until @entity15 start their @entity31 campaign against @entity32 in @entity33 , the hooker ’s jersey worn 61 times by @entity1 is fast becoming @entity7 ’ to lose			1
‘ if there is a better hooker in @entity15 after the weekend i do n’t know who he is , ’ said @entity16 director of rugby and former @entity15 no 2 @entity37 on wednesday			1
‘ @entity42 has been outstanding for us			0
his attitude is first rate , he does n’t worry about anything , he gets stuck in			0
if @entity25 has any pretensions of playing at @entity49 in front of @entity7 , you saw at the weekend the difference : the ball - carrying , the mentality , the mauling			2
‘ @entity7 is in a different league from @entity1 and from @entity25			1
’ youngs put put international rival @entity25 firmly in the shade with impressive display one would expect @entity37 to back his man , but on the evidence of the past six weeks it is hard to argue against him			1
@entity65 ’s promise to ‘ pick on form ’ will be put to the test if @entity7 can maintain his upward trajectory until the end of the month			2
‘ i ’m just glad to be back playing again , ’ said @entity7 , who will be hoping to add to his 17 caps			2
‘ if other people are playing well then fair enough , but as long as you ’re making the coach scratch his head that ’s all you can do			0
’ the 26 - year - old , who converted from centre to hooker only five years ago , has been criticised in the past for his wayward line - out throwing but insists he has ‘ kicked on again ’ in one facet of his art where @entity1 retains an edge			1
but in terms of carrying , breakdown work and link - play , @entity7 is his equal , while a disciplinary record of just two yellow cards in the past two seasons gives him a colossal advantage over his combustible @entity6 rival			2
@entity65 ’s promise to ‘ pick on form ’ for @entity15 will be put to the test by @entity56 ‘ @entity1 has more poor days at the office than @entity7 , ’ added @entity37			1
‘ @entity7 ’s discipline and attitude to physicality is right on the line			2
it is not over the line , it is not under the line , it is right on it every time he plays			0
i do n’t know what @entity42 ’s disciplinary record is but i think it is a lot better than the other bloke ( @entity1 )			2
even mine is better than that ! ’ the pair ’s last encounter saw @entity1 last only 16 minutes before receiving a straight red card for elbowing @entity113 in a brutal @entity114 at @entity115 shortly before @entity116			0
it also landed him a three - week ban that has allowed his less experienced rival to steal a march ahead of next month ’s @entity31			1
in @entity122 year , it could prove @entity1 ’s most costly indiscretion yet			0
@entity7 said : ‘ i went through a stage of getting stroppy on the pitch when i was on loan at @entity127 but i realised i was n’t really helping anyone out			0
@entity129 of @entity6 was sent off for punching @entity56 last year @entity6 hooker @entity1 landed three - week ban for elbowing @entity113 ‘ when i moved to hooker i had to earn the respect to play in the front row and felt that when someone punched me i had to punch them back			1
i was a centre moving to hooker and everyone wanted a bit of me			0
but i realised after a while i was n’t doing myself or my team much good			0
’ it is a lesson @entity1 still has n’t absorbed , despite an ever - lengthening charge sheet , and @entity143 will have to consider if his most experienced forward is worth taking another chance on at the @entity146 on february 6			0
the @entity15 coach is unlikely to be able to select @entity7 ’s clubmates @entity148 ( foot ) or @entity150 ( groin ) for the tournament opener against @entity32 after @entity37 revealed yesterday that neither player is likely to feature before the last weekend in january			1
meanwhile , @entity154 yesterday confirmed former @entity15 wing @entity155 has signed for @entity158 side @entity157			0
@entity161 fly - half @entity159 will join @entity154 next season , while stand - off @entity163 has been offered a coaching role at the @entity166			0
on a busy day of transfer activity , @entity6 announced the signing of 22 - year - old @entity171 fly - half @entity169 and @entity173 flanker @entity172 has joined @entity174 .			0

@entity15 start their @entity31 campaign against @entity32 in four weeks
@entity37 says @entity7 is currently the best hooker in @entity15
