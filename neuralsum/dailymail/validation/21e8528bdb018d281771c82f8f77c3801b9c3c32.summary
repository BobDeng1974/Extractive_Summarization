this so - called ‘ quad play ’ service is seen as key by the likes of @entity0 and its rivals @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22 to future growth and profits			1
@entity0 is to launch its own mobile phone service along with free access to @entity4 football @entity0 hopes that it will be able to sign up millions of households to packages that include the four services to cement its place as @entity32 ’s dominant media company in the 21st century			2
the company ’s move comes ahead of its purchase of the @entity32 ’s largest mobile phone network @entity36 in a deal worth £ 12.5billion			1
it has unveiled three sim card deals , where customers buy a sim and simply fit it to their existing handset in order to get access to calls , texts and 4g internet services , including video streaming			1
the service will operate across the @entity36 masts as well as the @entity52 offered via more than five million @entity54 hotspots			0
the 12 - month contracts will appeal to people who want to keep their existing handset but add a relatively cheap bundle of @entity59 data , minutes and texts			2
alternatively , they can buy a new @entity59 phone from the @entity62 from as little as £ 99			0
the cheapest sim card deal offers 500 mb of @entity59 data , unlimited texts and 200 minutes of calls for £ 5 a month if you are an existing @entity69 customer and £ 10 a month for everyone else			1

executive director at which ? , @entity93 , suggested the @entity0 move will boost competition and so could be good news for consumers			0

any impact on competition in the mobile market will depend on the terms of @entity0 ’s agreement with @entity36 , ’ he said			2
‘ @entity0 should use its entry into this market to drive improvements in customer service and to innovate for its customers			0
any positive changes must not be set back by the merger of @entity0 and @entity36			0
’ mobile expert at the website broadbandchoices , @entity118 , said : ‘ @entity0 ’s @entity120 - only launch is exactly the kind of shake up that was needed			2
‘ starting at just £ 5 per month , the pricing is very competitive for existing @entity0 customers and confirms @entity0 ’s ambitious plans to dominate quad - play before anyone else can get a foothold			1
‘ @entity22 and @entity129 have both had their own mobile offering for a while now , yet people have so far remained hesitant to sign up on a quad - play basis			1
‘ broadband , tv and phone is still very much seen as a household purchase whereas a mobile phone service is considered a personal one			2
bringing about a shift in perception will not happen overnight but if @entity0 are willing to put the marketing muscle so badly needed behind these packages , quad - play could completely change the bundles market			0
’ @entity144 , chief executive of @entity145 , said : ‘ offering @entity0 customers the @entity32 ’s best value @entity59 data deal is a great way to start our journey towards re-establishing ourselves as a major player in consumer mobile			1

we offer better value tariffs with a great range of handsets			0
