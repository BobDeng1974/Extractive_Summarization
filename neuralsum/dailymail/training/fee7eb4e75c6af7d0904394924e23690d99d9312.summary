although the couple ’s baby boy is third in line to the throne , he will have a rather rootless existence for the first few months of his life			1
the @entity7 and @entity8 will , initially , bring their newborn back to @entity10 , the two - bedroom @entity11 in the grounds of @entity14 they have lived in for the past two years			1
although it has its own small walled garden , the cottage can best be described as cosy and it will only be a temporary arrangement			0
she will reside there - on and off - for the next six weeks , while her husband completes his present tour of duty with the @entity37 in @entity38 , @entity39			2
the prince will finish his posting as a @entity43 pilot at @entity44 in early september , relocating to @entity45 while waiting for his next assignment , meaning the couple can enjoy some quality time together as a new family			1
within weeks – by october at the latest - it is hoped that they will finally be able to move into their new official @entity45 residence , @entity54 at @entity14 apartment @entity55 is actually a spacious four - storey , 20 - room property with its own large south - facing walled garden , which takes up half the @entity60 wing originally designed by sir @entity61 for @entity28 and @entity62			1
home sweet home : @entity10 , the two - bedroom @entity65 circled in red in the grounds of @entity14 , will be the baby 's first home second port of call : once @entity28 is back in @entity73 with the @entity37 , his wife will head to her parents ' mansion in @entity76 , @entity32 improvements : @entity55 , which is covered in scaffolding here , is having £ 1m worth of public money spent on it to transform it into a home fit for a future king and queen it boasts generous living space , including five reception rooms , three main bedrooms , dressing rooms and bathrooms , a night and day nursery , staff bedrooms and ‘ ancillary ’ rooms			1
former residents include @entity94 , queen @entity96 ’s daughter , and the late monarch ’s grandson , the @entity99 , followed by , most recently , the @entity96 ’s sister , @entity101 , and her husband , @entity103			0
the couple , who moved in following a £ 1.5million programme of refurbishment in 1963 , famously installed a ‘ futuristic ’ new kitchen ( which has since been ripped out ) complete with sleek @entity108 and teak units			2
it has been barely touched since the death of the @entity96 ’s sister in 2002 , however , and in recent years has been managed by the charity @entity113 ( @entity113 ) , which used the apartment as office and exhibition space			2
as @entity113 has already spent a substantial amount of its own money on remedial work , the @entity96 was last year forced to compensate it for handing the building over to @entity28 and @entity8			1
this was met by taxpayers and while it has been described by palace sources as ‘ fair ’ , it is believed to be more than £ 100,000			0
last month it emerged that a further £ 1million - worth of public money has been lavished so far this year on transforming the apartment into a home fit for a future king and queen			1
is it still blue ? the @entity96 's sister @entity101 in her drawing room in @entity14			1
she lived in the flat that will be home for @entity8 , @entity28 and the new baby in october while @entity28 and @entity8 are footing the bill for decoration and other ‘ soft furnishings ’ personally ( and it is understood that this will include a state - of - the - art new kitchen ) all structural work , rewiring , re-plastering and the installation of new environmentally friendly heating and hot water systems , is being met by the government			1
so far the bill is £ 600,000 and rising , much of which is down to the discovery of potentially lethal asbestos			0
a further £ 400,000 of taxpayer funds has also been spent on a new roof			0
@entity158 , we can also reveal , is being given her pick of priceless antiques from the @entity161 , one of the largest art collections in the world which is held in trust by the @entity96 for the nation , with which to furnish her new home			0
historic : a series of royals have lived in flat @entity55 at @entity14 , pictured here in 1960 when princess @entity101 was about to move in the collection comprises more than a million objets d’art collected by successive kings and queens over the past 500 years			1
although it is a charitable institution whose objective is to preserve and display these items in trust for the nation , one of the perks of being a member of the royal family is that they are also permitted to ‘ borrow ’ items to furnish their private homes			0
@entity8 is said to be having great fun in using her history of art degree to pick out some really special pieces – paintings in particular - but also display cases , dining tables and chairs			1
a palace source argued : ‘ it is the same for the @entity96 and other members of the @entity200 with regards to both their private residences and their offices			0
the alternative is [ that ] everything sits in storage			0
' contrary to reports that she has employed an interior designer , @entity8 has eschewed offers of professional help and is , it can be revealed , overseeing the work herself with the help of her private office			1
@entity158 is said to have ‘ a real interest in design ’ and has been encouraged by her father - in - law , prince @entity217 , to ‘ stamp her personality ’ on the project , albeit using @entity221 - sourced , environmentally friendly products as much as possible , naturally			2
she has been seen perusing fabrics in the upmarket @entity223 in @entity45 but has also been seen shopping in department stores such as @entity225 and @entity226			2
‘ it ’s a big task but she ’s confident enough to know exactly what she wants and how she wants to do it , ’ says an aide			0
although aides working for the @entity7 and @entity8 admit the works being carried out at @entity14 are ‘ extensive ’ , they insist that costs will be kept to a ‘ bare minimum ’ and maintain much of the outlay will fall to the couple privately			1
‘ currently , the apartment is totally uninhabitable without major structural works being carried out and the only public money being used is for remedial work to turn the apartment back into living accommodation , ’ said one			2
‘ the cost of any interior decorating and soft furnishings beyond basic re-plastering and painting and the like will be met by the @entity200 privately			0
‘ the couple are insistent that any costs to the public must be kept to the bare minimum			2
’ the spokesman added : ‘ it is important to note that the last major works in the apartment took place around the time that princess @entity101 and @entity103 moved into the apartment , following their marriage in 1960			0
‘ earlier this year , it was also reported that the @entity96 has offered the @entity263 the use of @entity265 , a @entity266 mansion which is part of her private @entity268 in @entity269 , as a country retreat			0
royal advisers have already pushed through a series of planning applications relating to the property , largely to ensure its new royal inhabitants have maximum privacy .			0

couple will take their newborn boy to @entity14 for first *fortnight*
when @entity28 returns to work , @entity8 will head to her parents ' mansion
by october they will then move into their refurbished @entity45 flat - which is actually a four - storey apartment with 20 rooms
