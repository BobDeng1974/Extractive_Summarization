by @entity0 for the @entity1 business secretary @entity2 boasted on @entity3 that he was voting to ' fix the @entity5 ' unfair bedroom tax ' the @entity6 were accused of ‘ outrageous hypocrisy ’ tonight after voting against one of the government ’s flagship welfare policies			1
@entity6 ministers and mps voted in the @entity13 for drastic changes to the ‘ spare room subsidy ’ for council house tenants - a policy better known as the ' bedroom tax ' which they voted for just two years ago			1
@entity20 ministers said the reversal would cost £ 1billion in additional welfare spending			1
business secretary @entity2 even described the policy by the ‘ bedroom tax ’ name given to it by its most vociferous critics			2
he wrote on @entity3 : ‘ i 'm cancelling my meetings today to go to vote for the @entity6 bill to fix the @entity5 ' unfair bedroom tax			1
’ @entity20 sources described their coalition partners ’ actions as a ‘ cynical pr move ’ designed to appeal to supporters ahead of @entity6 party conference next month			1
the move is also seen as a @entity6 tactic to charm @entity37 in the run - up to the 2015 election			1
@entity20 mp for @entity43 @entity42 said : ‘ the @entity6 are guilty of serial and outrageous hypocrisy			1
‘ this is not the first time they have changed their position on an issue to try and win back some of their former supporters			0
‘ they are clearly not a party who can be relied upon to stick to the same policy			0
’ @entity20 mp @entity57 said the @entity6 had shown they were ‘ devious and untrustworthy ’ and claimed the vote showed the coalition had officially come to an end			1
@entity6 ministers were allowed – in effect – to vote against the government after the normal rules on collective responsibility were suspended			1
with @entity67 backing the @entity68 it passed by 306 votes to 231			0
the @entity70 , which is proposed by backbench @entity6 mp @entity71 , would create sweeping new exemptions for people whose housing benefit could be reduced			2
the controversial reform , was first introduced in april 2013 – and backed by the @entity6 – meant social housing tenants deemed to have more bedrooms than they need have had their housing benefit reduced			2
it would lead to no - one facing a benefit cut if there was no smaller property available for them to move to			0
the @entity70 will in all likelihood be killed off by the government at a later date			0
but its continued life in the @entity13 could delay @entity20 efforts to vote for a @entity20 measure to put in law the proposed 2017 @entity93 referendum			1
conservative work and pensions secretary @entity94 claims he has simply removed a ' spare room subsidy ' for people living in state - funded houses that were too big for them			1
but @entity98 say it is simply a ' bedroom tax ' conservative minister for disabled people @entity100 warned that the @entity70 would cost £ 1 billion if it was made law			1
he demanded to know ‘ what spending cuts or tax increases ’ were proposed to pay for the change			0
supporters of the policy say it encourages people to move to appropriate sized properties , and housing associations to build suitably sized homes			0
@entity98 has insisted it will scrap what it calls the ‘ bedroom tax ’			0
shadow work and pensions secretary @entity117 said : ‘ the government should scrap the hated bedroom tax following the overwhelming vote by mps against the cruel tax on bedrooms today			2
‘ @entity124 and @entity126 's cruel and unfair bedroom tax has hit hundreds of thousands of people across the country causing misery , hardship and forcing families to rely on food banks			0
if the government wo n't ditch the bedroom tax , then the next @entity98 government will			0
’ @entity37 described the vote as ‘ incredible news ’ and a ‘ huge blow to @entity124 ’			0
the @entity6 insisted their change of heart on the policy was a result of seeing it in action			2
a @entity6 spokesman said : ‘ this bill is an excellent articulation of our policy which will help build a stronger economy in a fairer society			2
’ ‘ the @entity6 believe that only those already in the social rented sector who turn down suitable smaller homes will see a reduction in their benefit .			0
