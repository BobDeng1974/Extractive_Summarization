a @entity1 teenager has been infected with an incredibly rare virus after attempting to rescue a drowning kitten			2
the 17 - year - old developed a blackened wound on her wrist after picking up the dying kitten from a ditch			1
after numerous trips to different doctors , medics realised that the large , open wound was caused by the cowpox virus – a virus so rare that many doctors have never come across it			1
a @entity1 teenager has been infected with an incredibly rare virus - the cowpox virus - after attempting to rescue a drowning kitten			1
@entity20 is only found in @entity21 - mainly in the @entity22 the teenager developed a wound on her wrist shortly after coming into contact with the kitten which died shortly afterwards , @entity26 reports			1
it slowly blistered before turning black			0
at the same time , she also developed uncomfortable red lumps which spread the whole way up and down her arm			1
when the teenager first sought medical help , doctors assumed that the wound was infected with bacteria so prescribed her antibiotics but this did not help			2
the patient , whose case was reported in the @entity42 , then developed a fever so went to hospital			0
‘ when i saw the wound , i expected it to be a normal wound , so i was quite surprised when i saw the big ulcer , ’ dr @entity45 , a specialist in pediatric infectious disease at @entity47 in @entity48 , @entity1 , told @entity26			2
the 17 - year - old developed a blackened wound on her wrist after picking up a dying kitten from a ditch			1
doctors initially thought it was caused by a bacterial infection but it failed to respond to antibiotics ‘ it did not look like a normal bacterial infection , so i went looking for other causes of a necrotic ulcer [ a wound with dead tissue ]			1
’ the teenager ’s doctors started to suspect that the problem could be caused by the cowpox virus so they contacted a virologist who was able to test for the virus			1
@entity20 is a skin disease caused by the cowpox virus			1
it manifests itself in the form of red blisters which are transmitted from infected animals to humans			0
it is similar to , but more mild than , smallpox and it was the basis for the first smallpox vaccines			0
humans usually only become infected after contact with an infected cat or rodent			0
the disease tends to remain localised and is self - limiting			1
however , in patients with a suppressed immune system , it can be fatal			0
it is only found in @entity21 - mainly in the @entity22 - and infection is very rare			2
infections are most commonly seen in the autumn and are usually from domestic cats			0
these tests revealed that the cowpox virus was indeed responsible			1
@entity20 is a self - limiting disease so the teenager did not require treatment			1
she started to get better a week after her diagnosis and the ulcer healed completely within two months			0
however , she has been left with a scar			0
doctors believe that she contracted the disease , which is extremely rare , because she had a cut her wrist before she picked up the kitten			2
however , it is also possible to be infected with the virus without having a cut			0

17 - year - old developed black wound on her wrist after contact with kitten
she also had *painful* , red lumps over her whole arm
doctors thought it was a bacterial infection but antibiotics did not work
eventually , tests at a specialist *lab* revealed it was caused by cowpox virus
@entity20 is self - limiting so she did not require treatment
it can be infectious so a wound must be covered to *prevent* transmission
the wound cleared up within two months but she was left with a large scar
