thousands of miles from suspected alien crash sites , the people of @entity1 have good reason to consider themselves safe from the prying eyes of extra-terrestrials			1
but images shared by residents of what appears to be a @entity10 earlier this week suggest otherwise			2
hovering ominously in the dusk sky , the dark grey , disc - like object has sparked mystery among sceptics and space enthusiasts alike			1
mystery : residents were baffled by the sighting of a grey disc - shaped ufo in @entity1 on tuesday night and as weather experts rule out the possibility that the object was a cloud , the town has been left wondering just exactly what it was flying over its homes on tuesday evening			1
@entity29 from @entity30 said : ' i do n’t believe in @entity10 , but when i saw this i did n’t know what it was			0
' it did n't look like a cloud , and it was moving very fast			2
' it was a grey , disc - like shape , which i know sounds like a stereotypical @entity10 , but that ’s what it looked like			1
' i do n’t know much about military aircraft , but this was very fast - moving and very odd to see , ' the 23 - year - old added			2
another observer , who declined to be named , said : ' my initial thought was it was an aeroplane , but it was just moving too quickly			2
' i was the only one that saw it but was quick enough to take the picture			0
' i definitely believe in ufos and am very interested in science fiction , and often look up at the sky in the evening wondering if there is anything or anyone else out there			0

the ' fast - moving ' object appeared at around 7pm and appeared to some observes to be flying too quickly to be a plane or military aircraft experts dismissed claims that the object was a cloud , saying it was ' nothing to do with the weather '			1
@entity81 , from the @entity82 , said : ' after looking at the images , i can say the object is nothing to do with the weather			1
' there is no meteorological explanation for it			0
it 's not a cloud			2
' @entity92 , senior lecturer in the institute of cosmology and gravitation at the @entity96 , added : ‘ given the pictures show a dark object against a daytime sky , it ’s clearly not an astronomical object			1
' many @entity10 sightings are the planet @entity104 , but this one ca n’t be that			0
' those fearing alien invasion can rest easy however as even if there is extra-terrestrial life somewhere in the galaxy , it is too far away to make contact with @entity113 , she added			0
' the distances in space are so vast that it ’s just not possible for aliens to be visiting @entity113 , so any interpretation suggesting this is an alien spacecraft is clearly wrong			0
