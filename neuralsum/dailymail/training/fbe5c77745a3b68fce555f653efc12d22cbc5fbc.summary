by @entity0 this is the bizarre moment a hungry thief was captured on camera breaking into a deli using a crow bar before stealing a single bag of crisps			1
@entity9 footage shows the man breaking the door of the deli before creeping into @entity12 in @entity13 , to take a packet of sour cream and sweet onion kettle chips			1
and the thief is even forced to run back to the store after realising he has left behind his crow bar			1
she said : ‘ when the police saw the footage they could n't believe it			2
he tried for an hour to get in , spent three minutes in the shop , presumably looking for cash and only left with one packet of crisps			1
‘ the police joked that at that rate he 's not even making minimum wage			2
he must have been hungry			0
i left the shop at 9pm and came back at 7am the next morning to find that we had been broken into			1
‘ they did n't get anything because there is not really anything to take			0
they smashed the glass at the front , but none of the neighbours heard			0
i just ca n't get over how brazen they were about it			0
’ @entity60 said that there had been a number of break - ins in the whole of the @entity66 area of @entity13 , which includes @entity67 and @entity68 , in recent weeks			1
