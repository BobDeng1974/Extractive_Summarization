@entity0 not obliged to attend any potential retrial in @entity2 ' we are going to take this to the final level , ' says prosecutor by @entity7 and @entity8 last updated at 10:54 am on 5th october 2011 the public prosecutor who oversaw the collapse of the murder case against @entity12 said today he would appeal against the acquittal of the @entity15 student			1
' we will appeal , ' said @entity17			2
' the ( higher ) court will decide whether to confirm the first sentence or the second sentence			2
' according to the @entity2 judicial process , the prosecution can not file its appeal until the court publishes a formal explanation of its decision which is expected in a few months			1
' we will appeal , ' said public prosecutor @entity17			2
' the ( higher ) court will decide whether to confirm the first sentence or the second sentence ' heading home : @entity12 arrives in @entity28 from @entity2 as she makes the final leg of her journey home after being acquitted of @entity32 's murder the prosecution will appeal to the @entity34 , @entity2 's highest appeals court			1
murdered : @entity32 was killed just eight weeks after arriving in @entity2 mr @entity17 was speaking as @entity0 was pictured in @entity28 after flying in on a @entity36 flight from @entity37			1
she is on her way home to @entity41			2
the @entity2 prosecutor has been heavily criticised for his handling of the case and his pursuit of a murder conviction against @entity0 , 24 , and her former boyfriend @entity47 , 27			1
@entity32 , a 21 - year - old student from @entity49 in @entity50 , was found semi-naked with her throat slashed in a bedroom in the house she shared with @entity0 and two other women			1
@entity0 and @entity47 were convicted of killing miss @entity56 in 2009			1
the appeals court overturned the conviction last night			2
during original police questioning , @entity0 was questioned for more than 50 hours over four days			1
at one stage , she was quizzed by dozens of police for 14 hours			2
she eventually named barman @entity32 as the killer saying she vaguely remembered ' covering my ears in the kitchen as @entity68 murdered @entity32 ' and as a result of that he was arrested and spent two weeks in jail before being released			2
at her appeal , the judge upheld a conviction against @entity0 for slander – for falsely accusing mr @entity75 of carrying out the killing			1
going home : @entity0 ( pictured right ) at @entity79 on her way home to @entity41 in the @entity15 beaming : the young @entity15 smiles as she makes her way through the airport in @entity37 earlier today @entity0 's legal team stressed that her ' civil rights ' had been breached during the original questioning as she had no legal representation and no official translator - she barely spoke @entity2 having arrived in the country just a few weeks earlier			1
appeals judge @entity92 will now write up a report on the decision within the next 90 days			2
it is likely to be closely examined by prosecutors to find grounds on which they could launch an appeal			0
it is unlikely to be heard until next year			0
an appeal by the prosecutor would be heard by a panel of judges in @entity37 who would examine paperwork from the case and decide if there were any mistakes in the application of the law and if it needed to be reopened			2
however @entity0 is not obliged to attend any potential retrial and even though @entity2 could in theory ask for her extradition , it is unlikely that the @entity15 would hand her over			1
relief : @entity0 breaks down after being dramatically cleared of @entity32 's murder @entity0 's dramatic release has been widely welcomed by the @entity15 media , with many journalists arguing she should never had been found guilty of @entity32 's murder			1
articles written in the wake of her courtroom victory have been heavily critical of the @entity2 prosecutors ' far - fetched ' case against her			1
one has even compared her treatment to the @entity134 witch trials of 1692			0
prosecutor mr @entity17 had maintained @entity0 and @entity47 had killed @entity32 in a bungled sex game that had gone wrong while they always insisted they were innocent			1
mr @entity17 said : ' massive mistakes were made by the experts and by the panel of judges at the appeal - this is only the second stage			0
' we are going to take this to the third and final level at the @entity147 in @entity37			1
' the court found her guilty of slander - so why find her guilty of slander ? why did she commit the slander ? ' she said that to save herself from the murder charge			0
she named @entity32 to save herself and @entity47 simply followed her			0
wherever she goes , he goes			0
' mr @entity17 also suggested that @entity0 's appeal should have been stopped at the very beginning because of a comment made by an assistant judge , @entity159			1
judge @entity160 told the court at the start of the trial : ' the only thing we know for certain is that @entity32 was murdered			0
mr @entity17 said : ' the judge should have pulled his assistant by the ears and said '' hey you do n’t do that ''			0
in my opinion it shows he was not impartial			0
' at that point he should not have taken part in the appeal - this is a very serious error			0
you do n’t say things like that			0
' then another thing that also troubles us is that we saw the experts speak twice with the defence lawyers - that is not correct			0
' that is why they were so hostile towards us in the trial - they should have been impartial but instead were hostile to the prosecution			0
' stoic : @entity32 's mother @entity190 , brother @entity191 and sister @entity192 at a news conference in @entity194 earlier today			0
they said they were back to ' square one ' following the acquittal of @entity0 and her former boyfriend @entity47 @entity0 and @entity47 ’s appeal victory also throws up questions surrounding the conviction of @entity205 drifter @entity32 , 24 , who was found guilty of murdering and sexually assaulting @entity32 and originally sentenced to 30 years which was reduced to 16 on appeal			1
in his sentencing document , judges ruled that he committed the murder ' with others '			0
@entity0 and her legal team continually questioned why mr @entity17 was allowed to carry out the prosecution after he was convicted of abuse of office			1
last year he was found guilty of illegally wire tapping phone conversations between journalists and police officers during investigations			0
he was given a 16 - month suspended prison sentence which he is appealing but was allowed to continue working as a prosecutor			2
the family of @entity32 remain stunned by the verdict and said the search for answers goes on			0
her brother @entity191 , speaking at a press conference this morning , said the family was still trying to understand how a decision that ' was so certain two years ago has been so emphatically overturned ' .			0
