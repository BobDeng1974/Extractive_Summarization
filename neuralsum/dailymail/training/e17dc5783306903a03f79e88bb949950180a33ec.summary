first milk is delaying paying dairy farmers for two weeks after supermarket price wars saw the price of a pint of milk plummet to 22 pence last week more than 1,000 farmers were not paid for their milk yesterday after a crash in prices plunged the industry into crisis			1
the biggest dairy co-operative @entity0 delayed payments to its 1,300 farmer members by a fortnight – and cut the price it pays them			2
campaigners warned it was ‘ the worst crisis the industry has ever seen ’ , with little sign of matters improving			0
global milk prices have plummeted in recent months , meaning some @entity26 farmers now receive as little as 11.4p a pint ( 20p a litre ) – well below the average 15.9p a pint ( 28p per litre ) it costs to produce it			1
just a year ago farmers could expect to receive 19.2p a pint ( 34p a litre )			2
the amount paid to farms is now at its lowest level for eight years , far lower than in 2012 , when farmers blockaded milk processors in protest at the low prices they were paid			2
@entity0 , which sells milk to be turned into cheese , butter , yogurt and powdered milk around the world , has increasingly struggled to pay farmers as the lower prices drive down its income			2
its announcement comes after co-operative @entity51 and processors @entity53 and @entity54 also cut their milk prices in recent weeks			0
more than 60 dairy farmers are now going out of business every month , according to the @entity58			1
@entity0 chairman sir @entity59 , a @entity60 mp and former farming minister , said the dairy industry was going through a period of ‘ extreme volatility ’			0
’ he added : ‘ we are aware that hundreds of @entity26 dairy farmers are unlikely to find a home for their milk this spring			1
‘ our priority is to make the business and our processing assets as secure as possible			0
’ farmers have condemned supermarkets for cutting prices even further			0
@entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 and @entity69 now sell four pints of milk for 89p , while @entity71 , @entity91 ’s and @entity92 are not far behind at £ 1			1
the stores insist they are funding the price cut through their own profits and have not changed what they pay farmers			0
but farmers say selling milk more cheaply than mineral water is devaluing the product			1
@entity102 , of the @entity58 ’s dairy board , said : ‘ it looks like this is going to be the worst crisis the dairy industry has ever seen			1
retailers are fighting over market share and they are driving farmers out of business			0
if they do n’t support us there will be very few dairy farmers left in this country in six months ’ time			1
’ @entity58 president @entity116 warned that as farmers have been paid less and less , ‘ farm costs remain some 36 per cent higher than they were eight years ago and the single largest cost component of a dairy farm , animal feed , is more than 50 per cent higher than 2007 levels ’			1
he added : ‘ this combination has left many producers under extreme financial pressure and fearing for the future of their dairy businesses			0
you only have to look at the number of dairy farmers now leaving the sector			2
’ @entity133 , of lobby group @entity132 , said it was a ‘ dire situation ’ , warning banks may ‘ see this as a death knell ’ and stop supporting some farmers , many of whom are already financially stretched			0
campaigners fear the crisis will particularly hit small traditional farms , with large intensive farms increasing their market share .			0

@entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 and @entity69 are currently selling four pints of milk for 89p
