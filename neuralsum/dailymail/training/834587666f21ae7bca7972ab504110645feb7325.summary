a card arrives at my villa at @entity3 , @entity4			1
' @entity6 , we will be waiting for you at 7pm at the main jetty			2
' with the note is a parcel containing a sarong			2
' please wear this for our special evening			2
' a life on an ocean wave : the @entity16 resort in the @entity4 has its own luxury boat , @entity18 we meet on the jetty in our sarongs and are guided to a super-smart double - decker motor launch			1
there is champagne , canapes and the perfect sunset			2
all fabulous , but in this neck of the luxury woods - where dining is not just about the food , it is about ingenuity - not unique			2
then as dusk falls the secret of the evening is revealed			2
we are dropped off on a sandbank 150ft long , 50ft wide and about two inches above the sea			2
a bar has been dug out of the sand with oval seating and we are served rum cocktails in coconuts by candlelight			1
the entertainment is crab - racing - i select number 27 , my birthday - and it wins			0
dinner is called and we walk along a lantern - lit path until we reach the table , again dug into the sand with seating either side			0
it is laid up formally , with white linen , silver cutlery , too many wine glasses to count , flowers and a menu card			0
each course has a title			0
following the amuse bouche is after @entity61 , then setting @entity62 , @entity59 has come out , @entity63 and @entity64 , and each course is served with its own wine chosen by the @entity68 ' sommelier and , i have to admit it , i am blown away			1
' can you believe we are sitting in the middle of the @entity73 under a full moon , eating brulee out of a pineapple on a sand table ? ' said my friend , @entity78			1
actually no. it was pinch - yourself time			0
not a bad location to enjoy the sunset : the resort has suites which rank as the size of most houses the trouble with paradise , say some , is that there is nothing to do			1
but they miss the point			0
the @entity4 is a @entity92 for adults			1
palm trees and pale powder beaches , a translucent , turquoise sea full of fish with names like parrot , surgeon and emperor angel , and the scent of bougainvillea , hibiscus and frangipani everywhere			0
it 's pure @entity108 , only with air - con , wi - fi and your very own man friday			0
there are around a hundred resorts , each on its own island , and what sets each apart is not geography but style and service			0
@entity16 has the answer for anyone who fears that they will get bored staying on one small island - a few nights each at @entity123 and @entity124 , punctuated by a stay on @entity126 , a luxury three - deck cruiser			1
the sandbank dinner is part of the itinerary for the boat stay , although it wo n't appear in the brochure			1
the secret is part of the surprise			0
we spent one night on the boat travelling between resorts			1
i rose at 6am from my queen - sized bed in the cream - carpeted cabin for a sunrise snorkel with the resident marine biologist			0
soon we were swimming among hundreds of yellow and blue striped sweetlip and an army of fusiliers			0
the biologist pointed to the cornets , easy to spot with their long and skinny bodies , and the butterflies , brown and white with a long nose , and she enlightened me on the difference between an emperor angel fish , left , and damsel angel			1
we also ticked off masked bannerfish , a dog tooth tuna , a giant moray ( eel ) and porcupine fish			0
it is difficult to decide which resort i liked best			1
@entity168 , just 25 minutes by boat from the airport , scores on convenience , and the spa on its own little island is gorgeous			2
a swirl of colours and shapes : the waters of the @entity4 teem with fabulous fish and bright wildlife but several things at the larger @entity3 won it over for me			1
the first was being given a @entity180 service , which would alert me if the manta rays , which measure about 5ft and for which the region is famed , were sighted ( sadly , they were n't )			0
@entity186 was the beach - a headway separates two parts of the lagoon and the view is out of this world			0
@entity193 was the service ( chocolate popsicles handed out by the pool , a sunglasses butler and a chief engineer who repaired my glasses after i stepped on them ) and fourth was , of course , the sandbank dinner			0
@entity203 ( @entity204 , 020 8774 7299 ) offers 11 nights with @entity16 in the @entity4 from Â£ 5,985 per person			1
this includes return flights from @entity209 , transfers , four nights ' half - board at @entity213 , a three - night full - board cruise on the @entity18 and four nights ' half - board at @entity217 .			1

*guests* at the @entity16 in the @entity4 can try *drinks* with a difference
dinners and cocktails are served on a tiny sandbar in the @entity73
the resort also has its own boat , @entity18 , which sails the *archipelago*
