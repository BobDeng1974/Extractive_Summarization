with a @entity1 weekend fast approaching , it is time for many fans to check out their new signings			2
these 10 players have yet to play in @entity5 , and will be keen to impress			2
but what can you expect from them ? 1 ) @entity9 club : @entity11			1
@entity13 : on loan from @entity15			1
central defender or right back			2
one of the most promising signings of the window , having also attracted @entity20 and @entity21			2
@entity9 is a versatile and technically gifted defender who has represented @entity22 at every level from under 15 up			1
he has 37 full caps and played at this summer ’s @entity25			2
he has a point to prove after being deemed surplus to requirements after one season at @entity15 , where he had a limited role in their @entity33 success			1
he is a graduate of the @entity35 academy and played in the fixture against @entity37 in november 2010 when @entity38 first bit an opponent			2
@entity9 was signed by @entity11 on a season loan and will be keen to impress this season the @entity43 defender excelled in the @entity25 and is a regular for his national team at the back 2 ) @entity47 club : @entity49			1
@entity13 : £ 4.7m from @entity51			2
@entity47 was behind @entity53 on @entity49 ’s wishlist but he fits the bill for @entity56			2
he is a hard worker with an astute tactical brain who is tailor - made for the manager ’s high - intensity game			0
@entity61 were interested but @entity51 manager @entity62 told them they were n’t good enough			0
‘ i do n’t think @entity61 are the @entity51 of @entity5			0
when @entity61 ’s interest came to my ears , i almost laughed			0
i did a nervous giggle , ’ he said			0
@entity47 ’s father , @entity66 , managed @entity67 in the @entity68 , while his grandfather @entity69 was in charge of @entity71			0
@entity47 was somewhat of a surprise buy for @entity49 and @entity56 @entity47 's father said he almost giggled when he heard of @entity61 's interest in the former @entity51 man 3 ) @entity76 club : @entity78			1
@entity13 : £ 6m loan fee from @entity71			1
a huge talent who must answer some huge questions			0
is he committed to @entity78 , having tweeted shortly before his move that he was off to @entity86 ? is he the same player after major surgery on torn cruciate ligaments in his left knee last season ? can he thrive amid the pressure of a genuinely elite club ? @entity78 can only hope that the @entity96 answers the questions with more of the incredible numbers that have shaped his career : 200 goals in 305 club games , with a further 20 in 51 for his country			1
on form , he ’s a wonderful striker			0
@entity76 poses with the @entity78 shirt and assistant manager @entity107 the pressure is on the @entity96 striker to succeed after his loan move from @entity71 4 ) @entity111 club : @entity113			1
@entity13 : £ 9.5m from @entity115			1
it ’s a big signing for @entity113 , who hope the @entity121 striker ’s pace will work well in conjunction with targetman @entity123			1
apart from the large fee , this signing is a gamble			0
@entity111 moved to @entity125 as an 18 - year - old but did n’t score more than seven league goals in any of his five seasons in @entity129 , culminating in @entity115 ’s relegation in 2013			1
he proved to be hugely important as they won @entity132 last season , scoring 14 goals , and was also part of the @entity121 squad at the @entity25			0
@entity111 's signature by @entity113 is somewhat of a gamble but he impressed for @entity115 last season the young striker is also in and around the @entity121 national set up 5 ) @entity141 club : @entity78			1
@entity13 : £ 14m from @entity35			0
left back , defensive midfielder			0
he is familiar to @entity145 , having been part of the @entity148 @entity25 squad			0
blind is said to covet a midfield role at @entity151 and has been compared to @entity152			0
the son of former @entity35 and @entity148 defender @entity154 , @entity141 won the title with @entity35 four seasons in a row and is the 2014 @entity158			1
it will be fascinating to see how he copes away from @entity35 , where he signed aged 10 , and their manager @entity160 , who nurtured him			2
utility man @entity141 was signed by @entity78 from @entity35 for a fee of £ 14m the @entity165 international is the sun of former legend @entity167 and could make his debut this weekend 6 ) @entity169 club : @entity78			1
@entity13 : £ 16m from @entity172			0
centre back , left back , left wing			0
skilful and fiery , @entity169 excelled at the @entity25 for @entity174 , for whom he has 28 caps			1
he is a player who needs to be controlled , as demonstrated by his record at @entity172 — in two seasons he was booked 17 times and sent off on five occasions			0
he is covered in tattoos and married to lingerie model @entity182			0
he seems to have an aversion to using his right foot so watch out for his ‘ @entity187 ’ kick			0
@entity169 has more tattoos than he does @entity1 appearances for @entity78 the former @entity172 defender was brought in after an impressive @entity25 with @entity174 7 ) @entity191 club : @entity11			1
@entity13 : £ 10m from @entity194			0
his big - money move might have largely stayed under the radar but @entity191 has been monitored by leading clubs for some time			2
@entity11 need his goals and @entity191 has an impressive record , scoring 45 in 87 games for @entity194			1
the @entity204 striker is quick and likes to run at defenders			0
@entity191 is a gamble from @entity207 but his scoring record suggests it could pay off at @entity11 8 ) @entity209 club : @entity210			1
@entity13 : on loan from @entity212			2
it ’s been a strange few years for @entity209			1
in 2011 , his agent @entity216 said : ‘ we ’re talking to clubs like @entity219 , @entity220 , @entity221 , @entity21 and others			0
’ @entity223 and @entity224 were also reported to be interested			0
but it all went cold after he joined @entity212 for £ 11.5m in 2012 and more than two years on he has not scored a league goal for the club in 19 games			0
he has been loaned out to @entity230 ( nine goals in 37 games ) and @entity233 ( five in 25 )			0
now it ’s @entity210 ’s turn			1
@entity209 is somewhat of a journey man and @entity210 are the latest side to bring him in on loan from @entity212 @entity209 is a regular striking partner for @entity239 with @entity240 and played at the @entity25 9 ) @entity241 club : @entity243			1
@entity13 : on loan from @entity220			2
@entity248 ’s side struggled to create chances last season and have gone some way to fixing that with @entity241			1
they have an option to sign him permanently next summer			2
he is a fine player : good enough to play more than 100 games for @entity220 and to represent @entity174 at the @entity25 , albeit as a substitute limited to 30 minutes ’ playing time			0
he scored four goals in @entity129 last season and got eight assists , which makes his arrival on loan something of a coup			2
@entity241 had a sign season with @entity220 last season and could be seen as a coup by @entity243 10 ) @entity267 club : @entity269			1
@entity267 has done quite well for himself with five @entity129 titles , four @entity274 cups , four @entity275 , one @entity33 , one @entity276 , a @entity277 and the @entity278			1
even @entity279 raved about him			0
he was released by @entity220 in the summer after 10 excellent years and will spend the season attempting to marshal @entity269 ’s midfield as they bid to stay up			1
nicknamed for years ‘ @entity282 ’ — ‘ @entity283 ’ — he will bring masses of top - level experience to a squad who desperately need it			0
@entity267 is entering the twilight of his career but @entity269 have taken a punt on the midfielder the 34 - year - old was an unused substitute in the club 's 1 - 1 draw against @entity21 in their last fixture			1

@entity9 signed for @entity11 on loan from @entity15
@entity111 a risk for @entity113 but could shine after move from @entity115
@entity78 count on @entity76 , @entity169 and @entity141
@entity209 signed on loan by @entity210 after several temporary moves
@entity241 and @entity267 sign for @entity243 and @entity269
