‘ he was describing his sexual encounters with women			0
how he would say he met this woman at a club and she was from a @entity35 country , ’ @entity15 told the @entity25			2
‘ he said , “ you ’re from a middle eastern background too			0
” ’ the recent law school grad said she was afraid to rebuff @entity12 ’s advances because another female employee was fired for doing that very thing and she feared having a similar fate			2

’ polygamist ? @entity15 's suit claims @entity12 boasted of his multiple wives while she was his paralegal and once even forced her to feed him with chopsticks however , @entity15 claims things quickly became more serious and that she ‘ got pretty scared			1
