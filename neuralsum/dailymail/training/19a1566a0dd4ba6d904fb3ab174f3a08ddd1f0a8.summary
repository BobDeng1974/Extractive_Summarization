ministers say the soar in figures is a result of @entity5 's mishandling of immigration policy @entity7 could be hosting enough illegal immigrants to fill three cities the size of @entity11 , according to border officials			1
a @entity14 report says there may be as many as 863,000 illegal migrants – 70 per cent of whom are living in @entity17			1
the study also reveals that 10,000 foreigners who had no legal right to live in @entity7 have been granted permission to stay under the so - called 14 - year rule			1
it means they managed to stay in the country for so long without being booted out that the government has now given up the fight			1
ministers say the situation is a legacy of @entity5 's shambolic handling of border controls			0
the illegal immigrants are a mixture of those who sneaked into @entity7 in the back of lorries and those who arrived on visas but never went home			0
officials , overwhelmed by the foreign prisoners scandal and a deluge of asylum claims , did not have the resources to track them down			0
the ' robust estimate ' of how many illegals are living in the @entity7 comes from the @entity47 , and is included in a study titled @entity49 for reducing @entity50			2
the @entity47 found there were between 417,000 and 863,000 illegals living in the @entity7 , with a central figure of 613,000			1
the @entity14 says the top five countries from which the illegals have arrived are believed to be @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 , and @entity62			1
this is based on the nationalities of those people the authorities have detected			0
minister for immigration @entity67 promised a tougher stance on illegal migrants last night immigration minister @entity67 said : ' it 's no surprise that after years of uncontrolled immigration , we have a sizeable illegal immigrant population in @entity7			2
' we are determined to get immigration under control , and in the past year net migration has fallen by a quarter			0
we also want to get tough on illegal immigration			0
' the illegal population – more far outstrips the 275,000 who live in @entity11 – will add sharply to the number of foreign - born nationals living here legally			1
earlier this month , the official @entity83 showed that 7.5million people who were born abroad were living here in 2011 , of whom more than half have arrived since 2001			0
the @entity14 study sets out for the first time how many beneficiaries there have been of the 14 - year rule			1
this states that , once a migrant has lived in the @entity7 for this long , he or she will have established a right to a family life and should not normally be kicked out			0
between 2004 and 2011 , 9,266 ' irregular migrants ' were granted permission to stay , including a record figure of 2,062 in 2010			2
the total is now understood to have breached the 10,000 barrier .			2

figures show 70 *%* of the 863,000 illegals live in @entity17
10,000 allowed to stay after 14 - years of *hiding* from @entity108
most thought to come from @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 , and @entity62
