by @entity0 published : 15:57 est , 17 january 2013 updated : 16:39 est , 17 january 2013 in the dock : an artist 's drawing of @entity4 , during his appearance at @entity6 a pitbull owner whose devil dog called ‘ poison ’ savaged five police officers leaving a scene like ‘ the sickbay at the @entity13 ’ has been jailed for nearly two years			1
@entity14 , 25 , was sentenced to 22 months in prison for failing to act while his dog sunk its teeth into four police officers after they called at his house to execute a search warrant			1
as they entered the property the large brown pitbull - doberman cross - which was of a banned breed - began attacking officers in a 15 minute rampage that left three of them needing surgery			1
@entity14 ignored pleas to call his heavily built dog off the officers and said : ' it is not the dog ’s fault , you should have knocked and i would have let you in			1
' poison , which weighed four and a half stone , pounced on officers as they raided the house in @entity41 , @entity42 , in march last year , and clamped its jaws around one officer ’s thigh			1
it tried to drag him to the ground as another officer repeatedly hit it on the head with a metal battering ram , to no effect			0
he eventually prised the animal ’s jaws open with his baton but the dog turned on him instead grabbing hold of his right forearm			2
it went on to attack other police officer in the front garden and was only halted after being shot dead by a police marksman			1
prosecutor @entity65 told @entity6 : ' if you need a useful image in mind of the aftermath of the event , imagine the sickbay after the @entity13 and that will give you an idea - carnage			2
' @entity14 was jailed for what judge @entity74 called ' an astonishing act of inhumanity and callousness ' after he turned his back on pc @entity80 as he was attacked			2
violence : the dog 's blood splattered the road after police shot the frenzied pitbull , who had inflicted severe injuries on officers in a half - hour attack the charges related to the dog attack on pc @entity94 , pc @entity80 , pc @entity96 and pc @entity97			1
he was prosecuted for the initial attack on pc @entity100 as it happened inside the house			0
judge @entity74 said : ' to state these offences so baldly does not do justice to the mayhem which this out of control dog brought to a @entity42 street			1
' it was an extraordinary scene of carnage in a @entity42 street			1
' what was particularly shocking and what aggravates this is that while the dog was attacking pc @entity80 not very far from your front door the evidence is that you and other man came to the front door			2
extreme measures : the dog was killed with four blasts from a shotgun after inflicting hand , arm and leg wounds on five officers who were unable to restrain it ' pc @entity80 was screaming for help , asking you to get the dog off him and one of you said " there ’s nothing we can do " and the other said " you should have knocked , i would have let you in			1
" ' judge @entity74 continued : ' you were one of these two people			0
you and the other man went back inside the house			0
that was an astonishing act of inhumanity and callousness			0
' the dog was out of control and you did nothing to call it off or calm it			0
' @entity14 , who wore a grey tracksuit top , kissed his teeth and glared angrily towards the judge as he was sent down			0
@entity153 was with colleague pc @entity97 when they received the call to the address			0
the traumatised police officer hailed @entity160 ' selfless bravery ' as he grabbed the dog by the back of its neck and pinned it to the floor			2
victims ( from l - r ) : @entity119 's @entity94 , @entity80 and @entity167 on their way to give evidence against @entity14 judge @entity74 echoed his comments today , saying : ' @entity173 said what pc bones did was a selfless act of bravery - i agree with that			2
' what @entity160 did was to go up to the dog and hold it by the scruff of its neck			0
' in the process his fingers were severely bitten and indeed he thought one of his fingers had been bitten off			0
' in holding it down it was then possible for other officers to restrain the dog with their riot shields			2
even with the officers using their riot shields the dog was still trying to get out and bite the police			1
' it was only with the arrival of an armed officer that it was unfortunately dispatched			0
” the dog also attacked pc @entity94 ’s arm and was ' literally hanging off ' it as he swung around in an attempt to shake him off			2
@entity203 was left permanently scarred after being rushed for surgery and was off work for 85 days			0
judge @entity74 also recalled the victim impact statements of @entity208 , who had to undergo plastic surgery and @entity160 ' who has had nightmares and anxiety ' since the attack			0
the judge condemned @entity14 ’s irresponsibility as he sentenced him , saying : ' living as we do in close proximity to others there ’s no excuse for allowing the owner of a dog to let it get out of control in a public place			1
' the sentence i pass is outside the top bracket of the guidelines because i am satisfied that it is in the interests of justice that i should pass this sentence			0
' the sentence i pass is one of 22 months concurrent in each of the three offences			1
' @entity14 , of @entity238 in @entity41 , had earlier admitted to owning a fighting dog			1
he was also banned from keeping a dog for five years .			0

@entity242 sentenced to 22 months for failing to act when his dog sunk its teeth into officers
the powerful dog pounced after police executed a search warrant at his home in @entity41 , east @entity42
as dog *mauled* officers in a half - hour frenzied attack , its owner said : ' you should have just knocked on the door '
the pitbull was killed with four blasts from a shotgun - but not before inflicting severe hand , arm and leg wounds
