a new student craze is set to be the new planking after a video of men pouring milk over their heads in public places has gone viral			1
the group is made up of students and graduates , who are seen pouring four - pint containers of milk over themselves across @entity12			1
the video became an instant hit after it was uploaded on monday night and has amassed nearly 30,000 views in less than a week			1
@entity32 , 22 , who was behind the video said : ‘ we were just in our kitchen talking about doing it outside @entity37 in @entity38 and thought it would be really funny			0
‘ we did that , uploaded the video to @entity42 and got a load of likes			0
so then we thought " why not just make a video " ? ’ fellow ' milker ' @entity46 said : we did n't expect a reaction this large , the video was initially intended for our friends			0
' the reactions have been very mixed , the puns people have posted have been great and caused a lot of laughter in our house ! ' dairy danger : one of the participants is pouring the milk over his head in the @entity31 @entity62 - dairy : the camera pans past five ' milkers ' on poles , lined up to cover themselves in semi-skimmed milk early morning milk : a student combines breakfast and milking outside his house student paper @entity12 reported that students in @entity75 , @entity76 and @entity77 are all filming their own versions of @entity79 as the trend spreads across the @entity82 ’s institutions for higher education			1
mr @entity46 said at least two videos have been made - one at prestigious @entity85 , and the group have been inundated with messages from others wanting to film their own ' milking ' video			1
reactions to the hit video have been mixed with the comments section filled with puns and praise , whilst others say the students ’ behaviour is immature and a waste of money			2
‘ all cities should be milked , we should start a revolution , ’ @entity23 user @entity103 wrote , whilst @entity102 said : ‘ holy cow man ! dairy good video			2
just semi-skimming youtube when i found this			0
’ wastage : the group have been accused of wasting both time and milk - and in this case at least the milk has gone straight in the bin cow - mmute : ' milking ' in a busy roundabout and on the train platform in front of baffled commuters dair - ing : this ' milker ' only gets a few seconds outside a busy student nightspot before the bouncer has had enough and pushes him out of the way milking it : a mere 48 hours after it was uploaded on monday the video had amassed 10,000 hits - and other universities are following the new trend others were less impressed accusing ‘ milking ’ of being immature and a waste of milk			1
@entity135 commented : ‘ the inventive , future leaders of our country ! ’ local @entity139 councillor @entity138 tweeted : ' not sure @entity38 students are helping their public image with £ milking stunt			2
' the @entity79 group said that although they understand the concerns of mr @entity138 , the intent was not to give students a bad name			0
' we did n't think the video would stretch much further than our friends and would be disappointed if it created any animosity between students and residents , ' mr @entity46 said			0
but despite the success of the video and the possibility of having created the next planking trend the boys are skeptical saying ' milking ' is far less practical			2
' the smell of sour milk is present all over our house , and the laundry pile is high ! ' outdoor sport : there is no place which can not be ' milked ' whitewash : stunned revellers watch a man pour milk over his head in the middle of the outdoor area of a @entity12 hotel bar			0
