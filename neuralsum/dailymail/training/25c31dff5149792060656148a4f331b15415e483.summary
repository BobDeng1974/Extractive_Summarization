picture shows a policeman escorting a @entity7 away from @entity8 the government has spent £ 80,000 of taxpayers ’ cash flying @entity3 vagrants back to their homelands – only for many to return weeks later			1
more than 200 people were flown back to @entity7 and @entity14 in the first three months of this year – using tickets paid for by the @entity16 , according to figures obtained under the @entity18			1
the migrants returned to @entity3 after a crackdown ordered by @entity21 on foreign @entity23 nationals begging or sleeping rough in the @entity24			0
@entity26 landmarks such as @entity27 and @entity8 have been blighted by gangs of @entity7 beggars setting up makeshift camps , dumping rubbish and urinating in the street			1
there have also been increases in the levels of aggressive begging , pickpocketing and prostitution			0
but now it has emerged that @entity7 beggars who have been deported are returning using different names			1
a police officer based in the @entity27 area , who asked to remain anonymous , said : ‘ we ’ve been informed that they are getting an identity card but changing the name , although the number stays the same			0
so now we check the number as well as the name			0
’ @entity50 , chairman of the @entity52 safer neighbourhood panel , said he too was aware of deported @entity7 returning just weeks later			1
he said : ‘ some of them have been banned from this country and they come back using false identities			2
it ’s a waste of money			0
we need to have a border regime that is efficient and effective and does n’t let these people come sliding back in			1
’ last month it emerged that the number of @entity7 migrants sleeping rough in some of @entity26 ’s most exclusive districts had tripled since the @entity23 restrictions on their movements were lifted			1
the problem became so extreme that @entity69 council held talks with @entity16 officials last month			2
last night , critics of the free flights accused the government of wasting taxpayers ’ money			2
@entity77 , vice-chairman of @entity78 @entity24 , said : ‘ this strikes me as a colossal waste of money because there ’s no control over who comes back			2
‘ there ’s only a very light check in respect of those coming from the @entity23 into this country			0
so it does n’t surprise me that there ’s anecdotal evidence of @entity7 coming back when they know they ’ll get a free ride again back to their own country			1
he added : ‘ taxpayers would be better served if we did n’t spend their money on this			0
’ new powers came into force in the @entity116 allowing the @entity24 authorities to remove and ban @entity23 migrants from the country for 12 months if they are found to be vagrants or do n’t have a job			0
a @entity16 spokesman said : ‘ no @entity23 national has unrestricted access to the @entity24			2
those who are found to be abusing their free movement rights are given every opportunity to leave voluntarily			0
‘ however , if they consistently refuse this support , are destitute and can not demonstrate that they have a right to reside in the @entity24 , our only option is to enforce their removal			0
