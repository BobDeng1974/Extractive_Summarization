by @entity0 published : 04:10 est , 4 april 2012 updated : 08:30 est , 4 april 2012 under fire : the @entity2 , set up in response to @entity5 's review of ailing town centres , allocated money to 100 councils a £ 10 million pot of taxpayers ' money designed to rejuvenate @entity13 's failing high streets has been criticised for being unfairly distributed			1
the @entity2 , set up in response to @entity5 ’s review of ailing town centres , allocated £ 100,000 to 100 councils			1
the government said the funds were for areas ' blighted by empty shops and recovering from the riots to help bring entrepreneurs back to their communities '			0
but it has emerged that more than a third of the councils were earmarked for the financial assistance , had less than the national average of vacant shops			1
@entity30 had just two empty shops , which received £ 50,000 each , whereas @entity32 has 428 empty shops , so when the money was divided , each shop was worth just £ 233			1
@entity37 mp @entity36 , who sits on the @entity38 , criticised the way the money was allocated			0
he said the government did not collect data on high street vacancies and instead used vacancy rates including offices and other business premises in an area			0
@entity47 mp mr @entity36 said : ' this just shows the government has no idea of what ’s going on in town centres			2
unfair share : @entity30 , left , had just two vacant shops , which received £ 50,000 each , whereas @entity32 , right , has 428 empty shops , so when the money was divided , each shop was worth just £ 233 while high street shops continually closing down , particularly small independently - owned stores , cut - price shops are booming as cash - strapped families seek out bargains during the economic downturn , a report shows			1
they dominate a league table of the top 50 independent grocery retailers.six of the top ten are cut - price stores and they are responsible for half of all turnover in the top 50 , and two - thirds of all profits , according to the research published by @entity74			0
top 10 leading retailers : 1 @entity79 @entity78 b&m @entity77 99p stores source : the @entity82 magazine ' nearly 40 per cent of local authorities awarded money have a less than national average empty shops rate			1
my constituency of @entity47 has 45 empty shops in the town centre and we did n’t get a penny			2
yet a neighbouring @entity95 area to ( housing minister ) @entity93 ’ constituency with just two empty shops gets £ 100,000			1
' he added : ' the @entity101 has been in power for nearly two years now and you have to ask whether they ’re serious about trying to tackle problems on the high street			0
if they have n’t even got the right data on empty shops then they can hardly claim to be doing everything possible to support town centres			1
' in @entity113 , the main town centre in @entity30 has just two empty shops , according to analysis by retail specialists the @entity117			2
the review which covered 85 of the 100 areas awarded funding , found just 63 per cent of their core towns had a shop vacancy rate higher than the current national average of 14.6 per cent			2
local data company director @entity125 said : ' this quick analysis shows that there is a wide variance in town centre health within these local authorities ’ core towns			0
' whilst the government has published no allocation criteria , it clearly goes beyond assisting the weaker town centres through inclusion of below - average vacancy towns			2
smiles all round : @entity140 and retail expert @entity5 discuss her report on high street revival in a cafe in @entity144 last year ' as such it would suggest that the grant is also targeted towards the important role of supporting existing established businesses on high streets to ensure they continue to remain as occupiers			0
' whilst this funding from the government is clearly an encouraging sign , it does leave hundreds of town centres up and down the country with little or no hope of how they can invest in turning around or indeed just managing the further decline on their high streets , ' he added			0
a @entity38 spokesman said : ' business rates data is by far the most accurate at reflecting the number of empty business premises , and is provided by councils themselves - to use any other data would be to short - change councils whose high streets face the greatest challenges and who were worst affected by last year ’s riots			0

the @entity2 , was set up in response to @entity5 ’s review of ailing town centres
100 councils were allocated £ 100,000 to fill vacant shops - more than a third of those had less than the national average of vacant shops
@entity30 has just two vacant shops - which meant they got £ 50,000 each , whereas @entity32 which has 428 empty shops , the *equated* to each shop received just £ 233
