@entity6 , 69 , and 51 - year - old @entity7 were arrested in the summer when they were seen illegally digging trenches on the land			1
when police searched their homes in towns near the historic site , they were able to match the tools they recovered to plaster casts of marks left in the soil			1

the coins they discovered at the site are similar to the massive haul of 50,000 @entity19 items found in @entity69 last year , the largest hoard of @entity72 coins ever unearthed			2
historic : @entity74 was an important settlement throughout the @entity19 , @entity20 and mediaeval periods under the law of treasure trove , metal detectorists who find items of historic significance must report their discoveries to the authorities			0
an inquest is then held to determine if the items should be declared treasure , in which case they must be offered for sale to a museum so they can be preserved for the nation			0

after the hearing , @entity123 , governance and legal director of @entity12 , said : ' the sentence sets an important watershed in the combat against illegal metal detecting and acknowledges its true impact on society			1
' these are not people enjoying a hobby or professionals carrying out a careful study			0
they are thieves using metal detectors like a burglar uses a jemmy			0
' the material they are stealing belongs to the landowner and the history they are stealing belongs to all of us			0
' once the artefacts are removed from the ground and sold , the valuable knowledge they contain is lost for ever			0
' @entity154 @entity153 senior prosecutor @entity152 said : ' this case is the largest scale operation we have prosecuted for this type of crime			0
