by @entity0 last updated at 1:56 am on 27th october 2011 it is no faster or bigger than existing jumbo jets			0
but , as it took off on its maiden flight yesterday , @entity4 ’s @entity3 was hailed as the most revolutionary step in air passenger travel since @entity9			1
and that is not just because it is effectively made of plastic , making it lighter and more fuel - efficient than other planes			1
its major advance is on the inside , where it offers new levels of passenger comfort			0
the bigger windows are obvious , the wider seats and aisles less so			0
flight of fancy : passengers pose before boarding @entity29 ' @entity3 aircraft at @entity30 , @entity31 new era : the 787 dreamliner aircraft takes off the cabin hosts specially modified levels of air pressure and humidity to help avoid the headaches and nausea that can accompany a long - haul flight			1
the 787 also boasts 60 per cent lower noise levels and comes with anti-turbulence systems and even an advanced air - filtration system to eliminate unwanted odours			1
yesterday the new 264 - seat aircraft taxied on to runway a of @entity31 ’s @entity30 , with @entity47 carrier @entity46 inviting the @entity48 and more than 200 aviation experts and enthusiasts for the first flight from @entity31 to @entity52			1
the 787 looks wider than a conventional aircraft but is no bigger in either height or length			0
inside , it is a different story			0
as i walked up the gantry , the most notable difference is the eight - foot vaulted ceiling			1
roaringly good aircraft : a lion dance welcomes the first passengers off the @entity3 in @entity52 @entity64 : the high - tech cockpit is a dream for the 787 's pilots flying into the future : the 787 is sprayed with water to celebrate its arrival at @entity52 the 17ft - wide cabins are supposed to give a more spacious environment than similar - sized planes but look just the same as other aircraft			1
in economy class , the 787 ’s aisles are typically 55cm wide – 6cm wider than in most twin - aisle airplanes			1
in business class , the 65cm aisles are large enough to move past serving trolleys			0
seats : 210 to 250			0
range : 8,800 to 9,400 miles			0
@entity85 speed : mach 0.85 , about 650 mph			0
cargo volume : 4,400 cubic feet			0
maximum takeoff weight : 502,500 pounds			0
list price : $ 193.5 million ( £ 120million ) , although airlines often negotiate discounts			0
components : 50 per cent carbon fiber , 20 per cent aluminum , 15 per cent titanium , 10 per cent steel , 5 per cent other			1
engines : @entity98 or @entity99			0
the overhead compartments are 30 per cent bigger than those on the @entity4 , and comfortably take a suitcase			1
@entity4 ’s plan was to wow passengers with a series of groundbreaking innovations made possible by ditching the conventional aluminium shell for more modern carbon fibre			1
the same light and robust material used on @entity112 cars is the key to helping airlines shave 20 per cent off their fuel bills while freeing up cabin space			1
the @entity3 might not be as big as @entity119 ’s monster @entity117 , but that ’s because the 787 is pitched as a medium - sized workhorse for long - haul travel			1
it is being hailed as a green passenger jet because it is less fuel - thirsty than its peers			1
@entity4 claims its @entity98 and @entity99 engines will emit 20 per cent less carbon dioxide than similar - sized planes			1
@entity130 , general manager of the 787 project , said : ‘ everything from the shape and size of the wings to the design of the nacelle [ the casing around the engine ] make the plane more aerodynamic and reduce drag			1
’ @entity143 passengers will have to wait for the @entity3 ’s benefits			2
@entity145 will take delivery of 12 next year			0
@entity147 has ordered 24 , with the first due to arrive in 2013 , while @entity148 takes delivery of its first 15 @entity150 in the spring of 2014			0
there was one thing @entity4 did n’t improve			1
as you might expect on a plastic plane , we received a plastic meal of unrecognisable meat in an indistinguishable sauce			2
for passengers , the changes start with boarding			2
they enter into a wide - open area with sweeping arches			2
there 's an impression of more space			0
@entity169 is reduced just a bit , even if seats are as cramped as ever			0
another physiological trick : lights gradually change colour during long flights to reduce jet lag			2
but the biggest changes come thanks to the stronger composite shell , which is less susceptible to corrosion than aluminium			2
@entity46 wo n't be as dry , with humidity doubled to 16 per cent			0
trendy : the new @entity3 features a swish bar area inside track : the @entity3 's interiors feature sweeping arches , wide aisles , larger lavatories , and dynamic lighting thoughtful : the entryway is designed with sweeping arches aimed at directing the eye upward the cabin will be pressurised at the equivalent of 6,000 feet - 2,000 less than most planes			1
that should lead to fewer headaches and leave passengers with more energy during long trips			2
a number of passengers said today ’s flight was too short to notice any improvement			2
other changes for passengers include :			2

carriers looking to save fuel with carbon - composite jet
@entity213 light , improved cabin pressure for passengers
@entity4 hopes plane will *cement* its *domination* of @entity47 *market*
