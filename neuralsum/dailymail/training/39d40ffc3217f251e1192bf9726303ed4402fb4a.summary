an electronic nose can sniff out superbug @entity1 in pateints ' faeces			1
currently tests only look for toxins which suggest @entity1 might be present sniffing faeces with an ‘ electronic nose ’ can detect bacteria causing deadly infections , according to new research			1
an electronic nose was able to sniff out whether killer hospital superbug @entity1 ( c - diff ) was present in patients ’ faeces - as well as which variety they have			1
this is because different strains of the bacteria release different smelling chemicals , which the nose can pick up on			0
current tests just examine the symptoms and search the faeces for toxins which suggest c - diff is present , rather than sniffing out the bug itself			1
researchers at the @entity28 say the tool could be useful in screening patients in future			0
one of the researchers , professor @entity32 , told the @entity33 that electronic noses could be attached to bedpan washers to screen patients for c - diff			1
he said : ‘ by smelling different strains of @entity38 difficile we could tell which are good and which are potentially bad , which leads to the question , " can you screen patients ? " ‘ we 've shown it is possible to do it in the lab - the next thing we need to do is in bedpans			2
' we can [ put the e-nose ] on the side of bedpan washers as you start the cycle , sniff it and then say , " you may want to look at that patient "			0
’ c - diff can lead to serious infections , causing stomach cramps , temperatures and diarrhoea			1
it is resistant to many ordinary antibiotics and can lead to death			0
in 2012 , there were 1,646 deaths in the @entity68 involving c - diff			1
while the number of cases has fallen rapidly , a new strain of bacteria has emerged in recent years that tends to cause more severe infections			0
it is hoped that screening for c - diff could save the @entity77 money if patients are not hospitalised for so long with it			1
scientists were able to work out the ‘ chemical fingerprint ’ of compounds associated with the different strain of the bug			0
the electronic nose could smell the ' chemical fingerprints ' of different strains of the bacteria			2
researchers were able to work out the ' chemical fingerprint ' of compounds associated with different strains of the superbug			0
the electronic nose can identify each different strain scientists are already investigating whether electronic noses could be used to detect cancer , by looking for the unique smell of the chemicals produced by a lung or breast tumour			2
as well as being able to identify which strain of bacterial species is present , the researchers said that knowing which strain of bacteria was causing the illness could allow doctors to give more targeted treatment			0
dr @entity110 , from the university ’s @entity111 , said : ‘ current tests for c - diff do n’t generally give strain information - this test could allow doctors to see what strain was causing the illness and allow doctors to tailor their treatment			2

electronic nose can detect whether superbug @entity1 is present in faeces , as well as which strain
there were 1,646 deaths in the @entity68 in 2012 *due* to c - diff , which causes stomach cramps , temperatures and diarrhoea
current test just search faeces for toxins which suggest c - diff is present , rather than sniffing out the bug itself
*experts* say nose could be used to screen patients for the bacteria and could save the @entity77 money if patients are *n't* hospitalised for so long
