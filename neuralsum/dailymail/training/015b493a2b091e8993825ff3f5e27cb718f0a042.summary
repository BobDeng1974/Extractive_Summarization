tragic : 16 - month - old @entity16 's death in the popular resort of @entity20 on the @entity21 was originally blamed on bronchitis but @entity27 detectives asked their @entity2 counterparts to arrest his parents at their home in @entity31 in january 2009 after toxicology tests showed traces of heroin substitute methadone and an anti-depressant in his body			1
mr @entity13 did not oppose extradition and was sent back to @entity27 where he was remanded in custody			2
ms @entity12 fought extradition but was eventually sent back to @entity11 despite telling @entity31 sheriff 's court @entity16 's dad had allegedly confessed to leaving drugs around their hotel room within reach of @entity44			1
she was freed on bail ahead of the start of the trial but told she must stay on the island			2
leaked documents revealed that ex-heroin addict mr @entity13 had allegedly told @entity27 judges his son had ingested the drugs accidentally mixed up in a glass of orange juice			2
he has since split from @entity44 's mum			2
ms @entity12 's lawyer had apparently hoped to agree an out of court settlement at the eleventh hour			0
ms @entity12 's @entity61 - based lawyer @entity60 claimed that the high profile case of missing @entity63 led prosecutors to charge ms @entity12 with homicide in connection with the death of her son @entity16 but the trial , scheduled to finish today in front of a jury after three days of evidence , began on monday without any agreement having been reached			1
speaking this morning outside court , ms @entity12 's @entity61 - based lawyer @entity60 , said : ' neither @entity13 or @entity12 should be on trial for homicide			1
' @entity16 's death was the result of @entity13 's negligence			1
it was n't intended and was a tragic accident			0
' they 're being tried on a homicide charge because of the stubbornness of the court and the state prosecutor			0
' @entity86 was being flashed up on the television every day the year @entity16 died			1
' i 'm sure that 's played a part in why @entity12 is in front of a jury in court this week charged with homicide			0
' speaking last month , ms @entity12 protested her innocence			2
she said : ' i am not guilty			0
i thought my son had died of natural causes until @entity13 told me about the glass of juice after the results of the lab tests were known			1
it was a complete shock			0
' this is all a nightmare			0
how can they want me to go to prison for 14 years for something i knew absolutely nothing about ? ' lawyer mr @entity60 has claimed in the past : ' the father claims he opened the boy 's mouth and saw that there was no trace of any of the liquid in his mouth			0
' but instead of calling a doctor or rushing the infant to hospital he just washed and changed the lad , cleaned up the mess and said nothing about the incident			0
' the first @entity12 heard about this was seven months later when after the results of the lab tests came through			2
' there is absolutely no evidence whatsoever of any negligence or irresponsible behaviour on @entity12 's part			0
' the case continues .			0
