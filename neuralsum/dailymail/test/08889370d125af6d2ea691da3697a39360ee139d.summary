most women have known the frustrated feeling of nursing the broken heel of a irreplaceable shoe			1
or perhaps even experienced the struggle of finding footwear that is appropriate for all occasions			0
@entity7 has revolutionised women 's footwear with her collection of shoes that feature an interchangeable heel			1
every shoe features a button on the inside of the shoe , in the centre of the heel			1
once a new heel is slid into the shoe , it is locked into place , and at the press of the button , the heel can be released and slid out of place			1
the fact that the heel unlocks also makes awkward packing attempts a lot easier , and means that the heels can be also be slipped into an evening bag			2
in terms of storing the shoes , the heel can easily be slid off and packed away , which makes for less clumsy carrying or packing there are hundreds of heel varieties available , from high to low , stiletto to chunky , and in a large array of prints the brand was perfected in september 2013 , with the tagline reading : ' same shoe , different heels , endless possibilities			1
' from strappy metallic sandals , to versatile black pumps , there are styles to fit all occasions , and that 's before the multitude of heel choices are taken into consideration			2
@entity69 - born designer @entity7 has lived and worked in @entity70 for the last 20 years the interchangeable heels come in all widths , from chunky and secure , to a stylish stiletto , and prints vary from leopard print , to pink glitter , to even adorned with metal spikes			1
undoubtedly , the real sell is that , without changing the form or composition of the actual shoe , a high heel ( up to 3.5 inches ) can be swapped in for a low heel ( 1.5 inches )			2
masterminding the brand is @entity69 fashion designer , @entity7			1
the 44 - year - old has lived and worked in @entity70 for the last 20 years , and worked in strategy , consulting , technology and private equity			2
also a wife and a mum of three , @entity91 had no prior professional training and was completely self - taught			0
when @entity7 talks about inspiration for the start of the brand , she insists that it was completely personal			2
' [ the inspiration was ] from my life			0
i wore high heels to work , to restaurants , to parties			0
' i wore them everywhere but i could never manage the pain			0
once i nearly had a car accident when my heel locked under the break			0
' i just fantasised non-stop about a shoe where you could just take the heels off , and that would go from a comfortable low - heel to a high - heel , and still make me look good ! ' @entity7 has admitted that it was difficult to create a shoe , where the composition would n't change depending on the height of the heel			1
' it took 14 engineers and two and a half years to perfect the arch and the clip			0
' once we had a working principle , over 10 designers , shoe technicians and last specialists worked on creating styles that work in multi-height			2
' her shoe collection has now become fully integrated with her own wardrobe			0
she has worn a style from the collection ' every day of my life for the past 3 years ! ' @entity7 's invention means that high stilettos ( pictured left ) can be swapped for a chunky more comfortable heel ( pictured right ) depending on the occasion it 's not only just the heel height that 's the selling point - different prints can boost the outfit			1
in this case , pink sparkly heels are being chosen and slid on in terms of the celebrities @entity7 would want to wear the heels , the list is endless			1
' there are so many women who i admire			0
i would love @entity158 to try a pair because she has single - handedly re-branded fashion for the monarchy			0
' and also @entity163 , who was so clearly unhappy with the comfort of her heels last year at the @entity166			0
