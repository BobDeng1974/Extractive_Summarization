by @entity0 and @entity1 , @entity2 political editor @entity2 rep. @entity3 , the second most senior @entity4 in the @entity5 , lost his appeal friday to get on the august primary ballot after @entity9 election officials found problems with more than half of the @entity4 's nominating petitions			1
the secretary of state 's office affirmed a decision by @entity16 - area election officials to keep @entity3 off the ballot since he only submitted 455 valid signatures from registered voters in his heavily @entity21 district			1
at least 1,000 are needed to qualify for the primary ballot , and they must also be collected by registered voters			1
most of @entity3 ' were not			0
the decision does not necessarily end @entity3 ' 50 - year career in @entity27 as his campaign manager has said @entity3 would mount a write - in effort if necessary			1
why the long face ? rep. @entity3 will have to run for re-election as a wrote - in candidate after 50 years in @entity27 after signature gatherers screwed up one foot out the door ? @entity3 ( r ) , a 25 - term congressman , may have to run as a write - in candidate if he wants to stay in the @entity5 @entity3 is known for his unapologetic liberal stripes , but worked alongside some republicans as well , including the late rep. @entity39 ( r ) when they were their parties ' top dogs on the @entity42 -- they 're shown here sparring gently over the rules for president @entity46 's impeachment hearings there is precedent in @entity9 for such an effort			1
@entity16 mayor @entity50 launched a successful write - in campaign in last year 's primary after his name was kept off the ballot due to a residency issue			1
@entity3 also has mounted a legal challenge to have the @entity9 election law at the heart of the dispute declared unconstitutional , and a federal judge is expected to rule later friday			2
' the secretary of state made her decision , and we 'll live with it , ' said @entity65 , @entity3 ' campaign chair and a @entity21 state senator			2
' obviously , we disagree , and we 'll wait for the federal court to rule			0
' @entity3 , 85 , had appealed to secretary of state @entity69 after @entity71 officials said there were problems with some people who collected signatures			2
the circulators were n't registered to vote or had listed a wrong registration address			0
that can spoil petitions , under @entity9 law , and as a result @entity3 lacked the 1,000 signatures necessary to get on the ballot			2
@entity65 said friday that she had no choice but to ' enforce the circulator registration requirement as written			0
' big winner : rev. @entity88 ( @entity89 ) is running in the @entity21 primary that will no longer see @entity3 on the ballot @entity3 , now 85 , has been in @entity27 for five decades and represents a staunchly @entity21 district ' a circulator 's failure to register is a fatal defect that renders all signatures appearing on a petition he or she circulated invalid , ' her review said friday			1
ending @entity3 ' career that way would be ' pretty outrageous , ' his lawyer , @entity104 , said this week			0
political opponents said @entity3 should follow election procedures like other candidates			0
an attorney for a @entity21 challenger , the rev. @entity110 , said @entity3 for decades had no problem following the law			0
' in essence , they played the game , lost and then complained that the rules were unfair , ' @entity115 said , quoting a @entity121 judge .			0

the *no.* 2 @entity5 @entity4 is 85 years old and has served in @entity27 since 1964
he was kept off the @entity21 primary ballot for re-election when officials ruled that his petition signatures were n't collected by registered voters
now the @entity9 secretary of state has affirmed the ruling
@entity3 can still mount a write - in campaign in his heavily @entity21 district
his campaign has also sued in federal court , saying it 's unconstitutional to restrict who can and ca n't collect signatures for political candidates
