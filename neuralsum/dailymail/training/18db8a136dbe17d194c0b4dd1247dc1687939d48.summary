we ’ve seen the vampire facial and @entity2 is old news - so what are women now doing to turn back the clock in their desperate quest for youth ? the latest anti-ageing treatment taking the cosmetic industry by storm is the ‘ puppet facelift ’ , which experts claim can help women beat wrinkles without going under the knife			1
earning its nickname from the use of strings , or threads , to lift and volumise the cheeks and lower face , the puppet facelift is proving popular with women in their 30s seeking to reduce the first signs of ageing			1
former beauty queen , @entity26 , 34 , before ( left ) and after ( right ) , says the procedure has given her a boost in confidence , making her happier and feeling more feminine indeed , the non-surgical treatment , which costs £ 1,650 , saw a 1,065 per cent rise in enquiries at the start of the year			1
the treatment takes an hour or two and involves ‘ strings ’ being threaded through the face , under the skin to lift the muscles on the face			1
speaking about the cosmetic craze , dr @entity41 at @entity43 - based medical spa , @entity44 , said : ' the puppet facelift has been gaining popularity at a rapid rate , particularly with ladies in their 30s - and with good reason			1
' our 30s represent a transitional time , particularly for women			0
while the skin is n’t sagging enough to warrant a surgical facelift , the signs of ageing have started to set in - particularly around the jaw and cheeks			1
' the thread lift can help improve the appearance of skin laxity , giving patients a more volumised look			2
' dr @entity41 explains that the treatment offers patients a subtle facial lift that looks natural , meaning they avoid the ‘ wind tunnel ’ look often associated with surgical facelifts			0
the treatment takes an hour and involves ' strings ' being threaded under the skin to lift facial muscles thread lifting is being offered as a way of tightening jawlines and boosting cheek volume ' it makes them look refreshed rather than different , ' she added			1
' no one wants to look like they ’ve had work done , especially in their 30s , so this treatment offers the best solution			0
' it could be the end of the scalpel - the results are that good			0
' former beauty queen , @entity26 , 34 , who was crowned miss @entity92 in 2012 , underwent a puppet lift last year			1
she says the procedure has given her a boost in confidence , making her happier and feeling more feminine			1
' like many women my age , i found the transition into my early 30s a distressing time , ' she explained			0
@entity26 , 34 , before ( left ) and after ( right ) thinks her face looks fresher but not ' overdone ' since the procedure ' being a former beauty queen , i ’m very aware of my looks and ageing , and when i started to see the skin around my eyes becoming lax , making me look like i had eye bags , i decided to approach a professional for help			1
' dr @entity41 recommended i try it and it ’s changed my life			0
the idea of the " puppet lift " is quite strange to start with , especially when you see the strings poking through the skin			2
' but it lifts the muscles and skin making sure the face looks fresher but avoids the " overdone " look i associate with plastic surgery and facelifts			1
' i look and feel more youthful , and i love that my family and friends keep asking me how i look so fresh , rather than asking me what i ’ve had done			0
' under local anaesthetic , the threads - made of an extra-strong polymer and inserted with a fine needle at the hairline around the temples - are attached at the jowls and the folds that run from the nose to the corner of the mouth			0
there may be bruising or swelling in the days after the treatment and patients are advised not to smile for a week or so to let the threads settle			0
the body 's scar tissue keeps the threads in place and results are effective for five to seven years			0
former @entity151 @entity92 @entity26 says she looks and feels more youthful thanks to the one - hour treatment @entity154 , meanwhile , is one of the clinic 's older clients			1
the 57 - year - old from @entity44 underwent the non-surgical facelift after being scared to opt for surgery			2
' i came to dr. @entity41 last year when i started to feel gradually more unhappy with the sagging skin on my face and my eye bags , ' she said			2
' i felt like my face was ageing me , but i did n’t feel a facelift was the right option for me			2
the idea of scalpels and invasive surgery made me shudder , but the idea of threads sounded perfect for me			0
' before the treatment i looked like i was in my 60s or worse , but now i ’ve had people say i do n’t look a day over 45			0
' my confidence has never been higher , and i feel like a new woman - this treatment turned back the clock ten years for me			2
' @entity154 , 57 , underwent the non-surgical facelift after being scared to opt for surgery			0
she says that before the treatment ( left ) she looked like she was in her 60s but now ( right ) people say she looks 45 @entity154 felt like her face was ageing her but did n't feel that having a full facelift was the right option			2
