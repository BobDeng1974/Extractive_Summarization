by @entity0 published : 22:26 est , 2 october 2013 updated : 22:33 est , 2 october 2013 just two percent of counties across the country are responsible for more than half of all death row cases and executions , a death penalty research group has revealed			1
the @entity7 argues that the death penalty has never been a nationwide policy - nor even a statewide policy			0
instead , it 's the province of a few counties , usually because of prosecutors there who aggressively pursue the death penalty			0
the southern @entity14 is responsible for an overwhelming portion of death penalty cases since 1976			2
even in the @entity18 , most cases come from just a few counties disproportionate : counties like @entity21 , @entity22 , and @entity23 , @entity24 , file the overwhelming number of death penalty cases ' the disparate and highly clustered use of the death penalty raises serious questions of unequal and arbitrary application of the law , ' the group writes in its reports			0
' it also forces the jurisdictions that have resisted the death penalty for decades to pay for a costly legal process that is often marred with injustice			0
' the @entity7 officially has no stance on the death penalty , though critics say the reports the group produces exclusively argue against death penalty laws			0
its study found that since the death penalty was re-instated in the @entity14 in 1976 , just 2percent of counties are responsible for 52 percent of execution and 56 percent of all inmates on death row			1
additionally , 85 percent of counties in the @entity14 have not had an execution since 1976			1
@entity21 , @entity22 , - home of @entity53 - and @entity54 , @entity22 , - home of @entity55 - are the leading two counties in the country for executions since 1976 the figures are skewed , however , because only 32 states currently have the death penalty			2
in the last decade , six large states - including @entity63 , @entity64 and @entity65 - abolished the death penalty			0
the report singles out @entity67 , @entity68 - home to @entity69 and sheriff @entity70 , ' @entity14 's toughest sheriff			1
' @entity67 , which has 88 people on death row , has condemned four times as many people to die - on a per capita basis - as the much larger @entity23 , @entity24 , or @entity21 , @entity22			2
the @entity7 claims this is largely because of @entity67 attorney @entity77 , who sought the death penalty in 149 cases between 2005 and 2010			1
@entity67 , @entity68 , has a disproportionate number of inmates on death row compared to its population last year , the @entity83 unanimously issued a ruling disbarring @entity77 over corruption allegations			1
the allegations did n't especially relate to his prosecution of death penalty cases , but the @entity7 said the case proves that one man with an agenda can influence death penalty prosecutions			0
the @entity7 also pointed a finger at @entity95 , @entity96 , which has 88 people on death row - the ranking third in the country			1
it pointed out that even though even though the county had by far the highest number of death penalty cases in the state , its public defenders for capital cases were the lowest paid in all of @entity96			0
the @entity7 says this could be one reason many @entity95 death sentences are overturned on appeal .			2

study from @entity7 claims executions are the result of local *decisions* , because they are clustered in just a few counties
since 1976 , 85 percent of @entity14 counties have not had a single execution
@entity67 , @entity68 and @entity95 , @entity119 , have been singled out for having large numbers of death row inmates in proportion to their populations
