the @entity6 was a comfortable winner ahead of @entity9 's @entity8 after an excellent lead - out from his @entity13 team , while several riders lost position in the tight corners leading to the finish line			1
@entity8 was catching @entity1 in the final metres but had left himself too much to do , settling for second with @entity18 of @entity19 in third place			0
@entity22 king : @entity1 celebrates as he crosses the line to win stage two of the @entity3 a @entity3 @entity27 's @entity26 , the 2009 @entity3 winner inherited the leader 's red jersey from his team - mate @entity30 , with race favourite @entity31 tucked in second place			1
all the time gaps among the contenders remained the same , cementing @entity37 's advantage from saturday 's opening team time trial with @entity40 's @entity39 still 27 seconds back			1
saturday 's stage had left plenty of surprising time gaps between the general classification contenders , but sunday 's 174.4km stage was simply about staying safe for the main field while the sprinters eyed glory up ahead			0
the usual early break was a six - man group but featured a couple of notable names			0
proud : the @entity6 took the stage comfortably after a great lead - out , and made sure everyone knew it @entity57 , who had a dismal time trial , sent @entity60 up the road and he would lead them over the only categorised climb of the day to take the early @entity63 , while there was the unusual sight of the no. 1 number in a break as @entity19 's @entity68 - a late replacement for last year 's winner @entity70 - also went off the front			1
@entity60 and @entity73 's @entity72 dropped back after contesting the first climb , leaving @entity68 , @entity75 ( @entity76 ) @entity77 ( @entity73 ) , and @entity78 ( @entity79 ) out in front , where they built a lead which approached five minutes			2
the pack slowly hauled them back in as the main gc teams made their presence felt at the front of the @entity27 and @entity40 taking turns as they sought to keep their men safe on a some tight corners negotiated in strong winds that threatened to split the pack			1
they all stayed together , catching the break with a little under 17km to go and the battle began among the sprint teams to get to the front			0
it was @entity13 who were on the nose heading into the final two turns , and that was all the advantage @entity1 needed			2
solid : it was a day to ensure a safe ride for the leading contenders , with none of the favourites gaining ground			0
