by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 will not be posting more live messages on social media during the @entity6 games after his ' tweet of @entity9 ' moment in last week ’s friendly against @entity11			1
centre - half @entity2 , not selected for the game , posted a selfie as he watched the game from the bench alongside @entity17 and @entity18			1
it was accompanied by a message which said : ' @entity21 start from the boys ! ' but almost immediately @entity11 scored			2
video : watch @entity2 and @entity18 ' chilling ' before @entity6 played @entity11 tweet of death : @entity2 's pitch - side selfie , posted to twitter , caused something of a social media storm strong defence : @entity2 is taking advice from @entity32 about social media , including posting this picture of the two @entity6 defenders together playing tennis up for it : @entity2 ( left ) and @entity38 ( centre ) have formed a strong partnership at centre - back for @entity6 curse : @entity2 's tweet from the bench came just seconds before @entity44 headed @entity11 in front ' i ’ve had a bit of ribbing off the lads , ' said @entity2			1
' it ’s been classed the ' @entity50 '			0
i ’m still early days with @entity51 , so please bear with me and i ’ll try to get better			0
' i would n’t have done it in a game i was involved in , obviously			0
i was n’t involved and just wanted to wish the boys good luck but it took me too long to work out how to do anything and by the time i ’d pressed ‘ send ’ , literally 20 seconds later , @entity11 scored			2
' i was thinking : how do i delete this now , and @entity60 told me : you ’ve got no chance , just deal with it			0
everyone took it in fairly good spirits and no - one ’s too annoyed with me			0
' meanwhile , @entity67 has transferred his tv skills to the @entity6 video analysis department , according to @entity2			1
@entity6 are starting to focus on @entity70 and @entity2 said : ' the teams we ’re playing against , we know a few of the strikers already because they play in the @entity75 or some of the big clubs around @entity77 , so you ’ve an idea of what you ’re up against			1
focus : @entity83 's men have turned their attention to blunting @entity70 's attack next saturday pundit : @entity67 's work on tv has prepared him to lead @entity6 's video analysis of opponents in @entity91 ' but there ’s so much video you can get hold of			1
we ’ve got three video analysis people here			1
' obviously , @entity67 ’s more than capable of taking you through a video or two			2
it ’s pretty much like watching @entity101 , with more of a personal touch , and he ca n’t tell you off			0
' we ’ve got all the equipment that we need			0
we ’ll look at the @entity106 pairings , those who could potentially play up front for @entity70 , get that game out of the way and then move on to @entity111 and @entity112			0
