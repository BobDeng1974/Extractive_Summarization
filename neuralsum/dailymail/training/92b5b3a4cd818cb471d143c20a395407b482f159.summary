a newlywed died in her husband 's arms during a honeymoon scuba diving trip in the @entity4			1
@entity5 and @entity6 , from @entity7 , were scuba diving when something suddenly went horribly wrong			2
when @entity5 , who was 31 and an experienced diver , reached the surface she told her husband ' i feel sick '			1
@entity14 , pictured here just days before her death , was only 31 when she died in her husband @entity12 's arms after scuba diving on their honeymoon			1
she had suffered an internal bleed in her liver the @entity7 couple first met in 2013 after a mutual friend recommended @entity12 , a self - employed handyman , to @entity5 for home repair work			1
@entity5 was in a relationship and they started out as friends those were her last words			1
mere seconds later she died in @entity12 's arms			1
it was a tragic end to a slow - burning romance , one @entity12 describes as the ' best short story ever			1
' the couple first met in august 2013 after a mutual friend recommended @entity12 , a self - employed handyman , to @entity5 for repair work			1
after the meeting they both called their friend to find out more about the other person , admitting they had a crush			0
@entity12 , 51 , had liked that @entity5 , a dialysis nurse , ' came prepared with a ladder strapped to the top of her car , ' he wrote on @entity45 , a blog he keeps in remembrance of his wife			2
but the first chapter in the couple 's story was friendship - @entity5 was already in a relationship			2
and both had already decided their 20 - year age gap was too large an obstacle			1
the future couple reunited seven months later when @entity5 asked @entity12 to take a look at a bathroom she was hoping to remodel			1
the couple , pictured here on their wedding day , were also daunted by a 20 - year age gap			1
but after @entity5 broke up with her boyfriend , @entity12 finally asked her on a date - and proposed 18 days later @entity12 's work partner noticed that @entity5 's eyes were puffy and asked if she was okay			1
' @entity5 replied she had just that day broken off a romantic relationship and even though she had know for a while it was n't what she wanted she was still hurt over it ending , ' @entity12 wrote on his blog			2
' she said she debated on canceling our meeting but had determined that moving forward was how she planned to live her life now so what better time to meet us			0
' inspired by her ' logic and vulnerability , ' and ecstatic that she was single , @entity12 told his friend he was going to ' make a run for this girl '			2
his friend 's response ? ' a man can always dream '			0
but just as a repair had first brought the two to meet , it would also be the occasion to bring them together			0
@entity12 realized the bathroom repair would be an ' incredible opportunity to break the mold of dating , ' he told @entity92			2
barely a month after @entity12 proposed the couple exchanged vows , a decision they made just that day he asked @entity5 if she wanted to ' sweat - equity this project ' , meaning she would pay for the repair not with money , but by working with @entity12 side - by - side			1
@entity12 said he knew the approach would would ' give us a lot of time together '			2
for months the two worked to transform a bathroom filled with rusty metal , a rotted window , and a tiny , terrible tub			0
when they were n't working , the friends were eating plenty of meals together			0
but after the project was over , @entity12 was ready to end the friendship - and hopefully begin a relationship - with another invitation to dinner , which ended with a kiss			1
@entity12 wanted to skip a few chapters and make up for lost time			0
' i asked her to marry me 18 days later , ' he said			0
but even the wedding date set for five months later turned out to be too long of a wait			0
during a trip to visit his family , a month after the proposal , @entity12 found @entity5 writing something in the kitchen			1
' on the top of the page it said , " @entity134 " and " @entity135 "			0
i said , " baby , what 's this list about ? " ' she said , " i 'm making a pro / con list of us getting married today			0
" ' i looked up and my mom and my niece were beaming			0
i said , " forget the list , let 's vote			0
" ' by 4.30pm that day , with three guests and a bridal bouquet from @entity149 , they were married in @entity12 's parents front yard			1
the marriage stayed secret and the couple went on with their october wedding as planned before jetting off about a month later for their honeymoon in @entity158 , @entity159			0
it was there @entity5 died , from what turned out to be an internal bleed in her liver			2
the couple had only been married 168 days			0
