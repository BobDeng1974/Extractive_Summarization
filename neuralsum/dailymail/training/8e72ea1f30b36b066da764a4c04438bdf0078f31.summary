by @entity0 published : 13:52 est , 7 november 2012 updated : 17:02 est , 7 november 2012 @entity2 player @entity1 was racially abused by a 13 year old @entity4 fan a 13 - year - old football fan has been banned by @entity4 after admitting to racially abusing a player during a match last month			1
@entity4 have offered the boy a place on a ' @entity11 ' educational programme , instead of imposing a full life ban , ' in the hope that we can change his outlook on equality , racism and life in general '			1
the incident occurred during @entity4 's 2 - 1 win over @entity2 at the @entity21 on october 6			1
an investigation involving both clubs and the @entity24 started after the teenager verbally abused @entity2 player @entity1			1
@entity4 today confirmed the teenager had admitted abusing the player and has subsequently issued a written apology to @entity1			1
the club 's statement was released in conjunction with notices from the @entity24 and @entity2			2
' firstly we would like to put on record how grateful we are for the support and co-operation we have received from @entity2 and the @entity24 in resolving what has been a challenging and topical issue over the past four weeks , ' the statement read			2
' having completed our investigations into the incident , we have identified and interviewed a 13 - year - old boy who admitted a verbal exchange with @entity1 in which abuse was used			0
' the individual has been banned from @entity4 matches for the foreseeable future , but as a club we also felt , given the boy 's age and background , we had a duty to play our part in attempting to educate and rehabilitate him			2
' accordingly , we have offered to put him through one of our education programmes , run by @entity58 ( formerly the @entity59 ) in the hope that we can change his outlook on equality , racism and life in general			0
' in the meantime , the boy has written a letter to @entity1 offering his apology , which has been accepted			0
' while tackling the individual responsible , @entity4 also went on to critique the media response to @entity1 's complaint			2
the club believe the scale of the abuse was overplayed in some quarters and did little to mask their frustration			0
' we would also like to put on record how disappointed everybody at @entity4 was in the way in which the initial allegations were reported in some sections of the media , ' the statement continued			0
' these reports were made with no knowledge of the facts and created the impression that @entity2 players were subjected to racial chanting or systematic abuse by more than one individual			0
@entity4 have offered the teenager a place on their community education programme ' we trust that , now the facts have emerged , certain individuals will reflect on the reports they made			1
' finally , it is our hope that all of us within football , including governing bodies , clubs , players , fans and the media can continue to work together to build on the progress that has been made over many years in effectively tackling the issue of racism in our game , rather than merely sensationalising , and thereby trivialising it			0
