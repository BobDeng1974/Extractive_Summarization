by @entity0 published : 11:16 est , 10 december 2012 updated : 17:42 est , 11 december 2012 millions of @entity2 customers face an increase of more than £ 100 a year in energy bills after it announced a rise in tariffs			1
the company , which will put up prices from january 18 , is the last of the ‘ big six ’ suppliers to hit customers with an increase			1
@entity2 blamed higher wholesale prices , coupled with the cost of cutting the nation ’s carbon emissions through a shift to green energy			1
it also pointed to government policy which requires companies to add money to bills to fund the installation of free insulation for elderly and vulnerable customers			2
prices are on the move : @entity2 is the last of the ' big six ' energy suppliers to put their prices up the @entity31 - owned firm is putting up gas by 9.4 per cent and electricity by 7.7 per cent , which will squeeze the cost of living for some 4.8million customers			1
families who have a dual fuel contract will pay an extra 8.7 per cent – £ 103 a year , with the average annual bill rising to £ 1,263			1
director of consumer policy at @entity40 , @entity41 , said : ‘ as winter temperatures plummet , consumers could buckle under the strain of higher energy prices			1
‘ this winter almost nine in ten households are expected to ration their energy use to save on bills			2
’ heating up : price rises had been expected at the gas and electricity supplier after it said there would be no increase before the end of the year a graph showing a breakdown of @entity2 energy costs rises ' the fact is that high energy prices have a big impact on consumers and leave many unable to turn on their heating for fear of running up a large bill			1
’ director of energy at the official customer body , @entity71 , @entity72 , said consumers doubt whether the recent industry price rises are justified			0
she warned : ‘ higher energy prices will be , yet again , the greatest concern for many households this winter			1
‘ @entity80 payers need to know that wholesale prices and other costs have increased enough to justify these rises			2
as it stands the pressures on price are just too opaque and contested to provide confidence			0
’ @entity2 was the last of the six big energy firms to announce its price increase : @entity2 made clear that government policy and its pressure to support wind , solar and other low carbon sources for electricity is driving up bills			2
it said the cost of renewable energy schemes , building new networks of pylons to connect wind farms to the national grind and funding social schemes to insulate homes is rising fast			0
@entity2 chief executive , @entity106 , said : ‘ we have held back from increasing our prices for as long as we possibly could and at the same time have worked hard to reduce our own costs as a business so that our customers can get the best price possible			2
’ he insisted the company ’s profit margin of around two per cent last year was fair			0
but he said , ‘ unfortunately the other costs which make up energy bills are rising			0
‘ the price we pay for energy on the national and global wholesale markets is higher than it was and next year the government ’s @entity120 will add another charge to electricity bills which we and others regard as simply a tax			1
‘ network costs are rising too			0
these are the prices we pay to other companies to use the wires and pipes which transport the energy to your home , which are now more than 10per cent higher than last year and are expected to climb higher still in 2013			1
‘ the cost of the government ’s social schemes , which often focus on providing subsidised or free insulation , have more than doubled in the last 12 months and another increase is expected next year too			0
‘ finally , the cost of increasing the amount of energy we get from renewable sources such as wind farms , has risen by over 60 per cent when compared with last year			0
as with the other costs , this is expected to rise in 2013 too			0
’ mr @entity106 said while energy firms are under fire for their role , government ministers also need to explain how their decisions are driving up bills .			0
