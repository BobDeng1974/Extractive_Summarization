by @entity0 last updated at 5:47 pm on 15th december 2011 parking officials have come under fire for refusing to cancel a fine given to a woman while she underwent emergency treatment to save her unborn baby			1
heavily pregnant @entity7 parked her car on a meter outside the hospital she attended for a routine appointment			2
she expected to return to her car an hour later but was admitted to a ward because she had the condition pre-eclampsia which could have been life - threatening to her baby			2
fined : @entity7 , pictured with baby @entity15 , was given a £ 35 parking ticket because her car had over-stayed the permitted time on the meter mrs @entity7 remained in hospital and gave birth to healthy baby boy , @entity15 , two days later			1
while she was in there she was given a £ 35 parking ticket because her car had over-stayed the permitted time on the meter			1
but she was stunned when she later appealed the fine and was knocked back by her local council because her circumstances did not justify cancelling the ticket			1
mrs @entity7 , from @entity29 , said : ' at my appointment i was admitted there and then because my blood pressure was so high that there was a serious risk to me and the baby			2
' there was nothing i could do about it , it was such a shock and i was on my own so it was scary			2
' the last thing i was worrying about was moving my car			2
' i knew i was in a restricted area but i thought if i explained the situation to the council they would understand			2
' i ’m not saying i did n’t do anything wrong but all i want is a bit of humanity			0
do they really think i would put my baby ’s life at risk to go out and move my car ? ' mrs @entity7 , who has two other sons , @entity54 , aged seven , and @entity55 , 15 , later emailed the council to appeal the ticket which was issued outside the @entity58 in @entity29			1
she said : ' i emailed the council to say i was sorry and explained i was admitted in an emergency and there was nothing i could do			0
' they replied saying : '' we do appreciate and understand your circumstances but unfortunately hospital appointments can overrun			1
' we have considered your case and are satisfied that the ticket was administered correctly			1
' ' the thing they do n’t seem to understand is my appointment did n’t just overrun , it was a medical emergency			0
i had developed a condition called pre-eclampsia , and it can kill			0
' i was being monitored because it was life threatening to me and my baby			0
' mrs @entity7 , who runs @entity78 in @entity79 with her husband , was fined £ 35 to be paid within 14 days			0
she paid it as she did n't want to risk it rising to £ 70			0
she has received much support on an online forum where users have criticised the council			0
one commenter said : ' so in other words , we can all drop dead just as long as the @entity90 gets it ’s money			1
i find that totally disgusting			0
' another wrote : ' clearly a brainless , compassionless muppet ( sic ) in @entity90 who fully deserves to have their job cut			1
' a third poster added : ' typical council attitude			0
but , they get away with it because they are the council , unlike businesses that have to keep customers , they have a monopoly and manage to abuse it at every opportunity			0
' remember , we all pay for this bunch of muppets			0
' a @entity90 spokesman said : ' the parking ticket was challenged through our website and , though we are sympathetic to the circumstances , we felt that the details given were n’t sufficient to justify cancelling the ticket			1
' the ticket can still be challenged through official means as described on the back of the penalty charge notice			1

@entity90 says the circumstances do not justify cancelling the ticket
