it is the perfect invention for anyone who needs a gentle reminder to get off the sofa			0
@entity4 has invented a talking shoe that can sense activity – and inactivity – and tells the wearer when they need to get moving			1
fitted with a host of gadgets that measure movement , direction and balance , the built - in microprocessor connects to an audio speaker in the tongue of the @entity18 trainer			2
but not content simply to give someone feedback , the inventors at @entity4 have given the shoes their own personality – that of a sarcastic , impatient personal trainer who cheers and sneers in equal measure			1
when the wearer , for example , is stationary for too long , the trainers will say , ‘ this is super boring ’ , or ‘ let ’s do this ’			0
when someone ups their activity , the shoes will pipe up with , ‘ that ’s more like it ’ , and ‘ i love the feel of the wind in my laces ’			0
and increasing to a sprint will prompt the speakers to call out : ‘ call 911 , you are on fire ’ , or the ultimate in praise : ‘ you have made me a very proud shoe			2
’ where am i ? the shoe utilizes bluetooth technology to connect itself to the internet , and can provide location and directions using @entity4 's mapping app cheerleaders : the shoes can also utilize social networking sites , allowing a wearer 's friends to comment and ' like ' the performance he got game : the footwear could do all the trash talking for you during a high - intensity game on the court the trainers also connect to the internet via bluetooth and an @entity90 phone and work with @entity4 ’s mapping software to track and plot runs			1
@entity93 , product marketing manager for @entity4 , said : ‘ the trainer has pressure sensors in the sole and all of those collect the wearer ’s data in real time			1
‘ so if i ’m running , it recognises how many times my foot hits the ground in a minute through the accelerometer and sends the information to the web to an @entity90 app allowing us to tell a very rich story of the wearer			0
’ but , unfortunately for anyone who likes the sound of super-smart trainers , there are no plans to put them on sale			0
@entity4 , which unveiled the trainers at the @entity119 technology festival in @entity120 , @entity121 , developed the concept to showcase the possibilities of integrating everyday objects with cutting - edge technology			1
advertising executive @entity126 said the shoe was an exercise in showing what could be done – ‘ an experiment ’ in connecting any kind of object to the web and using it to collect and analyse information			0
close - up : while making movements , the shoe can literally talk to the person wearing them job well done : the shoe can offer compliments to its owner on a particularly good basketball game or other athletic performance			2

new footwear from @entity4 can provide directions , speed and can even dish out trash talk
