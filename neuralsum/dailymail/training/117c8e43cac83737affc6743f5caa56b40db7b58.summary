by @entity1 reporter published : 15:53 est , 1 october 2012 updated : 15:54 est , 1 october 2012 inspiration : @entity3 and @entity4 first met in a @entity6 bath house in 1863 and the two became drinking buddies @entity3 is known to generations as one of the most beloved characters in @entity13 literature , but new research into the man that inspired the fictional child shows that his real life counterpart was a hard - drinking fire fighter - turned - barkeep			1
author @entity4 was thought to have based his adventurous @entity20 child character on his acquaintance named @entity3 , and the writer 's admiration for his fire - fighting friend was so strong that he gave the character the man 's name in homage			1
a lengthy article published by the @entity30 details the relationship between @entity4 , whose real name was @entity4 , and @entity3 who met in a bath house in @entity6 during the mid 19th century			1
the two had many adventures together , gambling in @entity36 and drinking in seemingly every saloon that @entity6 had to offer			0
@entity3 was born in @entity38 and moved to @entity39 where he worked as a volunteer fire fighter , policeman and customs officer			0
@entity3 and @entity4 connected over their shared experiences with steamboats			2
before making his @entity46 , @entity3 used his notable strength to save 90 people from a fiery shipwreck			0
though such actions would rightfully earn anyone 's respect , @entity4 was particularly moved by the story because his own brother died in a tragic fire while working on a similar steamboat			2
the two men became fast friends after meeting in 1863 , with @entity3 travelling to @entity59 , @entity36 , at one point to visit @entity4 while he was working as a correspondent there			1
retiring to the bar : after many years as a volunteer fire fighter , @entity3 retired and worked running a saloon after one particularly heady night once the two men returned to @entity6 , @entity4 put his infamous hallow leg to the test and proclaimed to his friend that he would base a character in his yet - unwritten book on him			1
' he walks up to me and puts both hands on my shoulders			0
" @entity3 , " he says , " i ’m going to write a book about a boy and the kind i have in mind was just about the toughest boy in the world			0
@entity3 , he was just such a boy as you must have been ...			0
how many copies will you take , @entity3 , half cash ? " ' @entity3 told a local reporter shortly after @entity4 's first usage of the character in a book in 1876			1
on another - potentially more sober - instance , @entity4 repeated the plan to @entity3 , who always referred to him by his given name			2
' one day he says to me : " i am going to put you between the covers of a book some of these days , @entity3			0
" " go ahead , @entity93 , " i said , ‘ but do n’t disgrace my name , " ' @entity3 said			0
besides their fondness of brandy , the two men also shared a propensity for storytelling , and @entity3 believed that it was his anecdotes about his own childhood inspired @entity4 to create a version of his friend in his child form			2
the man named @entity93 : @entity3 called @entity4 ( pictured left and right ) by his given name , @entity4 , and the two men initially bonded over their shared appreciation of steamboats growing city : the two had many adventures together , gambling in @entity36 and drinking in seemingly every saloon that 19th - century @entity6 ( pictured ) had to offer ' we both was fond of telling stories and spinning yarns			1
@entity93 , he was mighty fond of children ’s doings and whenever he ’d see any little fellers a-fighting on the street , he ’d always stop and watch ’ em and then he ’d come up to the @entity123 and describe the whole doings and then i ’d try and beat his yarn by telling him of the antics i used to play when i was a kid and say , " i do n’t believe there ever was such another little devil ever lived as i was			0
" @entity93 , he would listen to these pranks of mine with great interest and he ’d occasionally take ’ em down in his notebook , ' @entity3 said			0
@entity134 said that the character of @entity3 was based a compilation of three real people : @entity138 , @entity139 , and @entity4 himself			1
in spite of such pronouncements , the historical evidence that @entity4 and the fire fighter version of @entity3 were close proves that there was likely a fourth , more prominent influencer in the creative mix.			1

@entity4 was close friends with a man named @entity3 when he lived in @entity6 in 1863
the author later used the name and his story for the famous character
