@entity0 has warned @entity1 he needs to toughen up if he wants to make it as a @entity4 player			1
@entity1 was touted as the new @entity5 when he signed in a £ 16.5million deal from @entity7 in 2011			2
but @entity0 claims the defender has spent too much time injured and , like team - mate @entity10 , who signed from @entity11 for £ 10m a year earlier , has gone backwards in his development			1
@entity0 said : ‘ we were told @entity1 was going to be the new @entity5 - @entity10 was going to be this and that			1
if anything i think they have gone backwards			2
‘ you say you have to give players a chance to mature , but also you ’ve got players who you say , “ we ’ve given you a chance and you ’re not taking it ”			2
they need to do a lot better if they want to cement their place at @entity4			1
‘ @entity1 needs to toughen up			1
every time i see him he is getting carried off			0
’ @entity38 has picked both players in his @entity42 @entity41 squad but they are likely to be in only as back - up to @entity44 and @entity45 in the centre of defence			1
asked if they were good enough to cover at centre back , @entity0 added : ‘ not on their current form			2
the two of them have had disappointing seasons			0
‘ but @entity42 might need them , you may get players who get injured			1
maybe in other positions they might be needed			0
maybe that is one of the reasons why @entity0 has taken @entity1 and @entity10 , with the thinking that they can play full back or midfield			1
’ been there and done it : @entity0 spent 12 years at @entity23 and made over 300 appearances for @entity4 there could be more pressure on the pair to perform for @entity4 after this summer ’s tournament now that @entity70 has left for @entity71 and @entity72 is not having his contract renewed			1
@entity72 was disappointed that he was informed of the decision by chief executive @entity75 straight after their final game of the season against @entity79 , but @entity0 said he should n’t be surprised			2
he said : ‘ if @entity4 are interested in keeping players or doing deals , they would have done it months ago			1
‘ it is no shock to hear that he is leaving			0
it happens when you get to 35 , that ’s the other side of football			0
i do n’t think @entity72 will be short of offers			0
’ waving goodbye : @entity0 was n't shocked to hear 35 - year - old @entity72 was leaving @entity4 meanwhile , @entity92 has called on @entity1 , @entity10 and the rest of @entity42 ’s young lions to be fearless in their quest for @entity41 glory this summer			1
former @entity42 striker @entity92 earned international recognition as a precocious 18 - year - old during the @entity41 in @entity100 in 1998			1
the likes of @entity102 , @entity103 and @entity104 could make a similar impact this summer			0
and @entity92 said : ‘ the advantage for the young players is that they will be fearless			2
when you go to a @entity41 and you ’re young you have no scars			0
you have only been used to success in youth football			0
players like myself who had n’t got used to any form of failure , it can be the biggest trump card you can play			0
‘ they are all good players , now it ’s all about what ’s between your ears			0
arrival : @entity92 burst onto the international scene after scoring against @entity123 at @entity41 98 ‘ are you tough enough , brave enough , courageous enough to get the ball when you ’re not playing well ? there ’s 90,000 people , it ’s boiling hot and you just want to curl up and die because you ’re knackered - and you ’re still taking the ball			0
‘ that ’s bravery that no one else sees apart from your mate on the pitch			0
‘ it ’s now about who has got the confidence and the arrogance to go out and take the @entity41 by storm			0
’ @entity0 was speaking at the launch of @entity141 's coverage of the @entity41 in @entity142 this summer			1

@entity4 hero @entity0 warns @entity1 to toughen up if he wants to cement a place at @entity23
@entity0 also believes @entity1 and @entity4 team - mate @entity10 have gone ' backwards ' in their development
