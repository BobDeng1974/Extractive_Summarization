by @entity0 for the @entity1 @entity2 last night warned they will target @entity4 over his support for a migrant amnesty if the @entity7 try to use him to erode their support			1
@entity7 sources yesterday confirmed that the @entity11 mayor will be deployed as a ‘ @entity2 killer ’ in next year ’s general election , following confirmation that he wants to return to parliament			1
mr @entity4 has agreed to carry out a tour of key marginal seats , where @entity7 strategists believe he may be able to persuade traditional voters who have defected to @entity2 to return to the @entity7 fold			1
@entity21 , right , has warned the @entity7 that he will target @entity4 over migrant amnesty but @entity21 dismissed the threat , saying @entity2 would highlight his views on immigration , including support for an amnesty for illegal immigrants			1
mr @entity21 , who was selected to fight @entity29 , in @entity30 , on tuesday night , told the @entity1 : ‘ if @entity4 wants to explain to our voters why he supports an amnesty for illegal immigrants then he is very welcome to – and we will do what we can to help			2
‘ of course @entity4 is very engaging and entertaining and he will appeal to parts of the @entity7 grassroots			0
but , as we pointed out yesterday , he is more oxbridge than @entity39 - our voters want representatives who stand up for the concerns of ordinary people whose voice is not heard			0
’ mr @entity4 has been positioning himself as a @entity44 recently			0
but he takes a much softer line on immigration than either @entity2 or @entity47			2
as recently as april this year , he attacked the government ’s ‘ crazy ’ immigration crackdown , and he has spoken out repeatedly in favour of an amnesty for illegal immigrants who have been in the @entity52 for years – a policy that even @entity54 has now abandoned			0
mr @entity21 said he was ‘ very confident ’ that @entity2 will win its first seats in parliament next year – and said he would quit as leader if the party fails to make the breakthrough			1
the @entity7 are planning to use @entity4 's popularity to block the @entity2 threat ‘ the old idea that we can not win seats at @entity66 has gone , ’ he said			1
‘ i am very confident we are going to win some seats – i ca n’t tell you how many – and in a tight , hung parliament we could even hold the balance of power			0
if that happens we will drive a very hard bargain that makes sure the @entity52 people get a full , free and fair referendum on our continued membership of the @entity76			0
’ mr @entity4 has been burnishing his @entity44 credentials in recent weeks as part of a drive to position him both to take on @entity2 and to eventually replace mr @entity47 as @entity7 leader			1
in a significant intervention this month , mr @entity4 went much further than the prime minister on the possibility leaving the @entity76 , saying @entity52 had ‘ nothing to be afraid ’ as it could go on to forge a ‘ great and glorious future ’ if it cut itself free from the shackles of ‘ job - destroying ’ @entity87			0
mr @entity4 and mr @entity47 are said to have made a secret pact under which the prime minister would give his old friend and rival a fair wind to return to @entity66 in return for the @entity11 mayor pledging not to destabilise his leadership			1
mr @entity4 will tour marginal seats in the coming months to drive home the @entity7 message that voting @entity2 risks putting @entity99 in @entity100			2
speaking in the wake of his decision on tuesday to ‘ whack in ’ an application to become @entity7 mp for the safe west @entity11 seat of @entity39 and @entity107 , he said : ‘ a vote for @entity2 will kill our chance of a referendum and a renegotiation on @entity113			2
the @entity76 needs reform and only @entity47 and the @entity7 offer that hope			0
‘ a vote for @entity2 is a vote for @entity118 – it will give voters who want change , who want to take powers back , exactly the opposite			0

*tories* plan to use @entity4 as a ' @entity2 killer ' during the 2015 election
@entity21 plans to counter that threat by *raising* the migration issue
the @entity2 leader believes the *current* @entity11 mayor is soft on immigration
