the @entity0 is set to lift a ban on imports of chicken from the @entity4 which are washed with a suspect acid disinfectant			1
@entity4 producers routinely wash raw chicken following slaughter with a substance called peroxyacetic acid ( @entity11 ) to remove harmful bacteria			1
the practice has been banned in @entity14 and @entity15 for many years because of a determination to remove harmful bugs at source , rather than using disinfectants to clean up carcasses			0
there are also concerns that reliance on these washes could put consumers at risk by playing a part in the creation of superbugs			0
however , the @entity30 has signalled that it plans to lift the ban following pressure from the @entity4 government and @entity4 chicken producers			0
the @entity0 has lifted a ban on @entity4 chickens which are washed in an acid it is feared helps cause superbugs the proposal has alarmed consumer groups , who say it is at odds with @entity15 policy , which has been designed to remove harmful bacteria from the birds on farms , rather than relying on disinfectants			1
just last week , the chef and food campaigner , @entity49 , warned that @entity14 and @entity15 risk importing inferior food from the @entity4 under a new free trade deal called @entity53			1
campaigners say the changes being planned to allow chicken washed with @entity11 are exactly the sort of thing that will become more common under the @entity53 regime			2
@entity60 , food campaigner for @entity61 , said : ‘ the @entity0 ’s approach to food safety is under attack , even before any trade deal with the @entity4 is agreed			1
‘ despite repeated denial from the @entity0 and national governments , the pressure is increasing to allow more imports of factory farmed meat rinsed in disinfectants			0
the @entity0 must take a clear stand and ban all imports of meat produced in this way , and show the public that it is not caving in to @entity4 trade interests			2
’ celebrity chef @entity49 has warned lowering standards risks allowing poor - quality @entity4 food into the @entity14 market in the past , @entity0 national governments have blocked moves by the @entity30 to approve imports of ‘ chlorinated chicken ’ from the @entity4 – chicken cleaned with a chlorine and water wash to kill bugs			2
this was done as a precaution and because it could mask poor hygiene standards , as well as harm the health of workers in abattoirs and lead to pollution			0
consumer groups argue that these same safeguards should be applied to the use of @entity11 and imports of chicken cleaned with the disinfectant			1
the @entity15 consumer organisation @entity103 insists that health and safety should be put ahead of a desire to improve trade relations with the @entity4			1
it said : ‘ as the @entity0 and the @entity4 are engaged into talks for a free trade agreement , we look to @entity0 authorities not to let their decision driven solely by trade considerations but to put food safety and consumer protection first			1
’ @entity103 said allowing the use of these chemical treatments opens the door to lower hygiene standards on farms and in slaughterhouses			0
this is because producers may believe they can wash away any contaminants , rather than ensuring they are not there in the first place			0
it said : ‘ we are concerned that @entity11 washes will not deliver any extra safety net			2
rather , we see the risk they might be seen as a convenient substitute for good slaughter hygiene			0
‘ the availability of such treatment might lead slaughterhouse staff to be less vigilant on preventing carcass contamination to happen in the first place , hence putting consumers ’ health at risk			0
’ the @entity141 has ruled that @entity11 is not toxic to humans , although it can trigger asthma and allergies in workers at processing plants where it is used			1
the death of a poultry inspector made the headlines in the @entity4 in 2013 and raised questions about the health risks associated with the use of chemical decontamination treatments of meat such as @entity11			2
@entity103 is also concerned that bugs might mutate and become immune to the chemicals used in the washing process , so getting through to the meat sold in supermarkets and restaurants			0
consumer groups have said shoppers do n't like the idea of their meat having been washed in chemicals the group said there is also sound research showing shoppers do not like the idea of their chicken being treated with an acid wash			1
research by the consumer group which ? in 2011 showed that 60 per cent of people were unlikely to buy chicken that had been sprayed or washed with a mild acid			2
the @entity180 said the @entity14 and @entity15 tradition of trying to keep harmful bugs out of the food chain , from farm to fork , was better for the public than relying on chemical disinfectants			0
chief executive , @entity188 , said : ‘ chemical treatments should never be used as a substitute for good hygiene practice			0
' @entity141 has confirmed that peroxyacetic acid is safe to use in food production , but @entity14 poultry producers are not yet convinced its use is in the best interests of consumers compared to our farm - to - fork system			1

food chiefs are to allow in chickens washed in peroxyacetic acid ( @entity11 )
*experts* fear the practice could be aiding the spread of superbugs
consumer groups have also warned that shoppers do n't like the idea
others say trade links with the @entity4 are being put ahead of safety
@entity141 has ruled that @entity11 is not toxic to humans
