by @entity0 @entity2 - @entity1 , 34 , completed the marathon in just over three hours - knocking more than four hours off his time last year of seven hours 24 minutes a @entity6 runner - who apparently completed the second half of the race quicker than @entity10 champion @entity9 - has denied claims he cheated			1
@entity2 - @entity1 , 34 , was accused of duping race officials yesterday after it emerged he completed the second leg of the marathon in just one hour , one minute - three minutes shy of the world record			1
but the personal trainer has defended the result , saying : ' i have done nothing wrong			2
this was my sixth @entity23 marathon			2
' i 'm a personal trainer			0
i train every day , seven days a week for the past seven years			1
nobody thinks maybe i just trained hard			1
speaking to the @entity25 , he added : ' nobody thinks " maybe he paced himself through the first half and when the second half came he just let himself go			2
" ' mr @entity30 - @entity1 , 34 , completed this year ’s marathon in a total of three hours eight minutes - knocking more than four hours off his last time of seven hours 24 minutes			1
the aspiring model , from @entity34 , @entity23 , ran the first half of the marathon in two hours and seven minutes – an average time for an amateur athlete			1
however , he apparently ran the second half of the race in just one hour and one minute – quicker than @entity10 hero @entity9 who completed the same stretch in one hour and five minutes			1
it means @entity30 - @entity1 finished the race in an impressive three hours and eight minutes – putting him in the top six per cent of competitors			1
however , online forums are awash with claims the runner cheated his way to the super-fast time , with some speculating he jumped over a waist - high barrier at the halfway point at @entity52			1
it is alleged he jumped the barrier separating the 13 - mile marker from the 22 - mile point and hid in the crowds while runners looped round @entity60 and doubled back			2
it is claimed he then jumped back into the race , joining a leading group of runners , and sprinted his way to the finish			2
@entity2 - @entity1 , 34 , above , from @entity34 , @entity23 , faces claims he cheated after completing the second half of the marathon in one hour and one minute - quicker than @entity10 champion @entity9 @entity6 organisers are investigating @entity2 - @entity1 ' time after he ran the second half of the race in just over an hour			1
internet forums are awash with claims he jumped over a barrier in the @entity52 area @entity2 - @entity1 ' result suggests he ran the second half of the race in just one hour and one minute – quicker than @entity10 champion @entity9 , above , who completed the same stretch in one hour five minutes the official @entity6 website logs his progress around the first half of the course , giving updates for every 5kms he completed			1
however , it only gives estimated times at the 25km , 30km and 35km markers – which has prompted critics to believe he either cheated his way to the finish by dodging those checkpoints or that his chip failed to activate at those points			0
however , his chip was working as he passed the 40km point and the finish line – which reveals he completed the last 13 miles in just one hour and one minute			2
the allegations come as @entity101 new presenter @entity100 revealed she was stopped by ' jobsworth ' officials 400 yards from the finish line and wrongly accused of cheating			1
writing on @entity106 , @entity100 said she had to push past a female official close to @entity108 after she was stopped and accused of having a fake number			0
@entity101 news presenter @entity100 , who completed the marathon in three hours 48 minutes , complained of being wrongly stopped by an official along with fellow runner @entity113 responding to her tweet , @entity113 , who was running the marathon to raise money for charity , claimed to have been stopped by the same official for seven minutes			1
@entity113 says the woman also accused him of having a fake number , adding that she could tell ' by the look in your eye ' that he was lying			0
when he also tried to give her the brush - off , the official threatened to call the police			0
@entity113 says he had to wait seven minutes while two other officials were called over to check the number , which turned out to be legitimate			2
he said he was ' gutted ' at being held up after training for six months for his first marathon			0
@entity30 - @entity1 had posted numerous photos on his @entity132 profile of him wearing his marathon medals and showing off his supposed athletic ability			1
however , the page was closed down this morning results on the @entity6 's official website show @entity2 - @entity1 completed the race in three hours eight minutes			1
however , they also show estimated times were given at the @entity142 , @entity143 and @entity144 markers elsewhere , forum users have questioned mr @entity30 - @entity1 speedy time , suggesting it would have been a ‘ miracle ’ if he managed to complete the second half of the race in such a short space of time			1
one user , @entity152 , posted on a forum on @entity154 : ‘ first half seems fair enough			0
second half is nothing short of a miracle			0
‘ it is possible that he ran easy for the first half , then went all out in the second half			2
‘ however , it would need a chip malfunction at 25 , 30 , and 35k for this to have happened			0
‘ it would also mean that he is capable of running a half at just over 60 minute pace , which again is possible if he was a @entity168 elite runner , but certainly not after doing a 13.1 mile warm up			0
’ another user , @entity170 - a fellow marathon runner - said : ‘ if it was legit he would have sped past me on @entity174 walk			2
i know i was tired but i think i 'd have noticed someone 4.30 miling			0
’ another marathon runner , @entity176 , said : ‘ i saw @entity2 just after @entity52 and he was absolutely smashing it ’ , before adding : ‘ @entity178 noted the barrier skip … that would make complete sense as to why i saw him there , looking so fresh ! ’ and @entity191 said : ‘ if he did cheat then i think a ban is in order , i worked very hard for my time this year , did a sub 3:30 for my first marathon and went through a lot of pain in the last three miles , if people are skipping out miles then shame on them ! ’ @entity195 confirmed @entity30 - @entity1 ’ results were being investigated			1
a spokesman told @entity198 : ‘ we have anti-cheating measures during the event , and then post-event when we analyse split times from points around the course			0
‘ runners found to have cheated are removed from results and banned from future events			0
’ @entity2 - @entity1 , 34 , completed this year 's marathon in just over three hours - knocking more than four hours off his time last year of seven hours 24 minutes @entity30 - @entity1 , who wore a @entity211 mask during last weekend ’s race , has taken part in the @entity6 for the last six years			1

at the time , the grandfather from @entity259 , @entity260 , said : ' i have been called a cheat and disqualified from a race i never claimed to have won			2
' he claimed he was injured after falling over a runner ahead of him who had tripped on a safety barrier and said : ' i could n't possibly continue			0
' he insists he never claimed to have run the last part of the course and that he did not try to pass off the winning time as his own			0
