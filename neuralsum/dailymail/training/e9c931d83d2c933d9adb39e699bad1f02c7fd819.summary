by @entity0 packed up neatly , the princess @entity2 gift boxes were all ready to be sent to the @entity3 in the trenches 100 years ago			2
but the cardboard carton containing 80 embossed brass tins in packs of eight was never sent to the @entity8 and they remained unopened – until now			1
fittingly , the honour of snipping the string tied round the carton and opening the tins for the first time in a century fell to @entity14 , great - great - niece of @entity15 of @entity16 , the then secretary of state for war whose mustachioed face and pointing hand were made famous on @entity22 ’s best known @entity21 recruitment poster			1
family : the gift boxes , intended for the trenches were opened at the @entity26 in @entity27 , by @entity14 , posing with a poster of her ancestor his face gazed down from one of only four known surviving originals of that poster as @entity35 – with her husband @entity37 , creator of @entity38 , by her side – literally lifted the lid on these poignant pieces of history			1
@entity42 agreed to open them at the @entity26 at an event staged by @entity46 auctioneers			1
the carton was found in @entity48 where it was part of a private collection of @entity21 memorabilia			1
princess @entity2 , daughter of @entity53 , started a @entity54 in november 1914 to give those wearing the @entity53 ’s uniform and serving overseas on christmas day 1914 a ‘ gift from the nation ’			2
at the time , it was expected the war would be over by early 1915			0
history box : the 80 embossed princess mary brass tins were found to contain a pencil made from a .303 shell case and a printed note from princess @entity2 previous examples of the tins have contained cigarettes , boiled sweets , chocolate and a pencil made from a .303 shell case along with a printed note reading : ‘ with best wishes for a victorious @entity75 from the @entity2 and friends at home			1
’ those opened at the festival in @entity80 on saturday only contained the pen and note			2
experts said other items would have been added later to suit individual recipients – for example , non-smokers would get sweets rather than cigarettes			1
it is not known why the carton was never sent			0
after opening the boxes , @entity42 , a former lady - in - waiting to princess @entity93 , told the @entity96 : ‘ it was really extraordinary – a really , really moving experience , and i was tremendously honoured , and humbled actually , at doing such a thing			0
‘ the smell as i opened them was a mixture of sawdust and damp … and funnily enough , @entity37 said , of his grandmother ’s drawing room			0
’ she added : ‘ it was perhaps the very first time the soldiers who received these boxes were away from home … to be in the trenches in all that discomfort and being so frightened , you ca n’t imagine what that was like			0
‘ so to get a little present like that from princess @entity2 was thrilling and i ’m sure unexpected as well			0
’ @entity116 , of @entity117 , said the boxes would be offered for sale for £ 300 each , with 10 per cent of proceeds going to military charities			0
mr @entity116 added that he had thought there were only three of the @entity15 recruitment posters – until @entity42 remarked that she had one too			0
