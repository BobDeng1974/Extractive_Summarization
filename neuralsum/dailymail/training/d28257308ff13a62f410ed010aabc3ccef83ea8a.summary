by @entity1 reporter published : 07:21 est , 2 august 2012 updated : 09:26 est , 2 august 2012 a young girl with cerebral palsy who dreams of being a ballet dancer , is one step closer after a life - changing operation in @entity8			1
@entity9 , six , underwent an operation on her back and legs to help her walk totally independently			2
now just six weeks after the operation , the schoolgirl has been able to walk 18 steps without a walking frame or sticks			2
write caption here @entity19 ’s mother @entity18 , 32 , and father @entity20 , 47 , spent almost two years trying to raise the £ 50,000 to take her to @entity21 in @entity22 as the procedure - called a selective dorsal rhizotomy - is not widely available in @entity25			1
during the operation surgeons gain access to the nerve roots in the spinal cord by opening up one vertebra			2
the abnormal nerve roots causing the spasticity are identified by electrical stimulation			2
the nerves that are not ' transmitting ' effectively are partially cut			0
physiotherapy is then essential to build up the leg muscles as they are weaker through not being used			1
it means that @entity19 , from @entity38 in @entity39 , could soon take ballet classes			1
mrs @entity41 said : ' the hospital was amazing and all the staff were so nice and so kind			0
even the day after the operation her legs were very different			0
' she can now move her toes separately and i ’ve noticed she can tap her foot in time to music - before it was her whole leg			1
' they ’re small changes and most people just take those things for granted but to us they ’re amazing to see and it makes a massive difference to us			0
' her family and friends worked tirelessly for almost two years to organise fundraising events including charity nights , sponsored slimming , walks and runs , coffee mornings and dress down days			0
while the operation is complete , @entity19 now faces months of gruelling physiotherapy to build her strength and coordination			1
mrs @entity41 added : ' she can now stand very , very straight and her doctors believe that within six months she can move on to the sticks all the time and then in a year or so , hopefully , she will walk independently			0
' we ’re so grateful to everyone who ’s helped us do this , we just wish there was more awareness in this country of the procedure so that parents have a choice			0

@entity19 now faces *intense* physiotherapy to build up the leg muscles she has *n't* used *properly* before
