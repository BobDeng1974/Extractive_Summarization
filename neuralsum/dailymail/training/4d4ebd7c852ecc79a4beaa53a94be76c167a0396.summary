@entity0 was facing further attacks on his leadership today as damning polls showed he was now less popular than @entity4			2
former @entity6 deputy prime minister @entity5 accused ' pointy heads ' like mr @entity0 of running a series of disastrous election campaigns which have allowed the party 's support to slump			1
the party 's support has hit 32 per cent – the lowest in four years – while mr @entity0 has seen his own approval ratings slump hit rock bottom			1
@entity0 is now more unpopular than @entity4 , according to a poll released today by @entity16 mr @entity0 is less unpopular in the north of @entity18 than elsewhere - but even in @entity6 's heartland just under seven in 10 voters say he is doing a bad job just 18 per cent of voters think mr @entity0 is doing a good job , against 73 per cent who think he is doing badly – an overall rating of minus 55 , which is now worse than mr @entity4 , on minus 54			1
@entity26 , meanwhile , has an overall rating of minus 14			0
some 40 per cent of voters think he is doing a good job , against 54 who think he is doing poorly , according to a @entity16 poll for the @entity31			2
overall , @entity6 still retains a one - point lead over the @entity33 , who sit on just 31 per cent			0
@entity6 's dire polls , less than six months before the general election , have piled further pressure on mr @entity0			1
lord @entity5 said @entity6 's campaign strategy needed a complete overhaul before the election			1
writing in the @entity41 he said : ' to be frank , our campaigns have not been very successful			0
' from the 2010 general election to local and @entity47 elections and by - elections , it seems strategy is driven by the pointy - heads not the lionhearts			0
' the @entity53 referendum campaign was only saved by dedicated old - school campaigners like @entity55 and @entity56 who went out and spoke with passion about @entity6 's values , achievements and positive case for the future			1
in these last six months we need passionate campaigners to sell our popular policies			0
' former deputy prime minister @entity5 - seen listening to @entity0 's party conference speech this year - said the party needed less ' pointy heads ' in charge - and more ' lionhearts ' @entity56 , the front - runner to be the next @entity6 leader in @entity53 , this morning warned the part faced electoral annihilation if it did not put an end to the infighting			1
he said : ' parties that turn in on themselves - think of the footballing analogy - if a football team tackles its own players in public or takes on its own players in public it very quickly starts to play in an empty football stadium without any supporters			0
' and there 's a lesson in that football analogy for the @entity6 and all the political parties as we watch the @entity89 party tear itself apart			2
but i 'm confident @entity0 's @entity6 wo n't do that sort of thing			2
' shadow secretary of state for international development @entity56 appeared on @entity95 's the @entity94 this morning mr @entity56 formally launched his campaign to become @entity97 and first minister of scotland yesterday mr @entity56 also announced he was going to stand down as shadow international development secretary to concentrate on winning the leadership in @entity53			0

he said @entity6 would not be ' forgotten or forgiven for a generation ' for joining forces with the @entity33 to campaign against independence			0
@entity53 's first minister @entity105 said it was possible that the @entity113 could go into @entity114 with @entity6 in @entity115 but mr @entity105 refused to rule out a coalition between the @entity113 and @entity6 , if they were to hold the balance of power at the next general election			1
