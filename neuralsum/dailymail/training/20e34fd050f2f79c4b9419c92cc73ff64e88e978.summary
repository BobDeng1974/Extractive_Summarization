questions unanswered : @entity58 said the inquest did not provide full closure two windows were smashed and two others were dislodged but did not shatter			0
forensic pathologist dr @entity63 told the inquest that mr @entity7 suffered a fractured skull and extensive brain damage			1
his report found that the death was ' consistent with an impact by or against a heavy object such as a window frame '			2
he said mr @entity7 , of @entity72 , suffered injuries usually seen in victims of car accidents , and that he was ' effectively dead ' after the blow to the head			1
@entity41 , deputy director for the @entity78 , which carried out an investigation following the incident , said : ' there was a great deal of violence and force involved in what happened as the windows were smashed and dislodged			0
' he went on : ' we could not say with any confidence that there was anything to be alarmed with about the condition of those windows			0
' he said the ship was hit by a ' significantly large wave ' amid ' phenomenal ' sea conditions caused by a storm which had come across from the west sooner than expected			1
mr @entity41 said the ship 's assessment of weather forecasts was ' competent '			2
but , following his recommendation , the vessel now uses a more accurate bespoke weather forecasting service			2

but speaking after the hearing , mrs @entity58 said she had noticed the window was rusting			2
when asked if the inquest had given her the answers she was looking for , she replied : ' no , not really , because why were we shown to the table by the window ? ' there were rusty puddles on the windowsill			2
we sat there because it was a lovely view of a rough sea			0
' mrs @entity58 claims the windows on @entity11 were rusting and that there were rusty puddles on the windowsill by the table where her husband was hit her solicitor , @entity126 , said : ' i do n't think there is any doubt when you look at the photographs those windows look , quite frankly , a bit dodgy			0
' perhaps the strength of the waves was extremely unusual , but you do n't expect to be sitting in a restaurant and have the window come in on you			0
' there are questions still to be answered about the strength of the windows			0
' @entity143 , senior coroner for @entity34 , said : ' in light of all the evidence that has been heard before this court i shall record a conclusion on the record of inquest - that is answering how he died - that @entity152 died as a result of an accident , a tragic accident			1
' he clearly was a much - loved gentleman			0
' addressing mrs @entity58 directly , she added : ' you have had the ordeal of sitting through this inquest this afternoon and you have done that with the utmost dignity			0
