if there is one player i would have liked to have been it is @entity4			1
i feel very proud and honoured to have been on the same pitch as him			1
now he is leaving @entity8 i say one thing to him : do not retire			1
go and play in @entity12 , you are a young man , you can carry on for five or six years			1
and if , when the @entity14 season is closed and you are looking for a loan back to @entity16 , i know my dad would love to have him ... video is @entity4 the best @entity20 player of all time ? scroll down to see former @entity16 captain @entity4 will leave @entity8 when his contract expires in the summer @entity23 celebrates his goal with @entity4 during a @entity20 clash with @entity26 in 2001 when you talk about @entity8 ’s greatest players , you think about @entity29 and @entity30 ; but they were surrounded by other fantastic players			1
he has been the captain , leader and inspiration for some poor teams			1
he has been their @entity36 , their superman			1
we can remember those moments			1
against @entity41 in 2004 in the @entity42 when they were going out and he scored a rocket goal			1
his header in the @entity42 final against @entity46 in @entity47			1
his match - winning performance against @entity50 in the 2006 @entity45 when they had all but lost the game at @entity53 ’s @entity52 but , somehow , he won them the trophy			1
the @entity8 skipper has often been the man to bail his team out on the big occasion with an important goal @entity4 was instrumental in his side 's unlikely run to the @entity42 @entity4 was man of the match in the 2006 fa cup final , scoring twice to help @entity8 lift the trophy @entity4 and @entity65 columnist @entity64 celebrate @entity8 's 2005 @entity42 win the first time i saw him on the training pitch , i passed the ball and i expected him to send it back to me			1
he turned and pinged a 50 - yard crossfield pass			1
i can remember the noise ; like a golfer hitting the sweet spot			1
i knew we had a player			1
when i told our manager @entity79 , he thought i was talking about somebody else ! but the players knew			1
some will say now that he should retire at the top , as a one - club player			1
i say that you are a long time retired			2
he has to play on for as long as he can			2
he can still pass a ball as beautifully as anyone			2
@entity23 ( left ) , @entity64 , @entity90 and @entity4 in the @entity8 gym in 2002 @entity4 and @entity23 joke with @entity93 ( centre ) and @entity95 before the 2001 @entity45 final why the @entity14 ? he will know that the game in @entity98 is for young men			1
he has earned the chance to play the game at his pace			2
he could play in @entity102 with @entity103 or in @entity104 with the @entity105 , or even for @entity106 if the former @entity16 captain gets his @entity109 franchise off the ground in the future			2
there are times when @entity4 has looked as if he is carrying the weight of the world on his shoulders this season , since @entity8 failed to win that coveted @entity20 title last season			1
and since @entity120 departed for @entity121 and @entity122 has been injured , that has virtually been the case			2
there has n’t been the usual smile or the swagger we ’ve associated with him during matches , and he has been moved around the pitch in a manner that has complicated his performances			2
i found myself thinking : ‘ just let him play ’			2
@entity4 scored 13 times for @entity8 last season , coming agonisingly close to his first @entity20 title @entity137 , @entity4 and @entity138 are free transfers and will be able to talk to foreign clubs once the transfer window opens ... @entity142 is more interesting ; he can still do a job for @entity8 and i hope he stays , but he may feel the criticism has become unbearable			1
if he does stay , just let him play ! there is too much ‘ make him a holding midfielder ’ , or ‘ let ’s push him forward ’			2
now he can do that in @entity12 amid the relative calm of the @entity14			2
he can be a superstar , just as @entity106 was out there			2
why now ? he reads the newspapers , listens to the radio phone - ins , logs on to the websites			2
people have been saying he has lost his pace and that he is not the same player			0
he ’s a sensitive boy and such criticism and comments will weigh on his mind			0
this decision will not have been easy for him — it will have hurt him			0
he loves @entity8 and it has been his club			1
he ’s their talisman and it was his ambition to win them a title			0
it was difficult , too , for him to turn down @entity167 when @entity168 first came calling , but this will have been just as tough			0
the hardest thing is to visualise him in another kit , with another badge on his chest			0
some will say he is like a boxer coming towards the end ; do n’t take one more fight			0
it ’s different for @entity177			0
we all remember him at @entity50 , before he moved to @entity167			0
now he is at @entity179			0
@entity4 has played 695 games for @entity8 ; we are n’t used to seeing him in another strip , apart from @entity16			1
but i still think he should play on			0
@entity4 has been an inspirational captain for more than a decade , leading the team since 2003 i remember reading in his book how anxious he was when he first joined up with @entity16 , and that i had to get him from his room before a meal to bring him down to join the rest of the squad			1
i do n’t recall that			0
i just remember him being a superhero from the moment i set eyes on him			0
what a player ! but i do n’t want this to read like an obituary			0
i want it to be a reflection of his brilliant career and i hope there is more to come			0
the moment when you make that run , you make that tackle , you score that goal … if you retire , you never get that back again			0
you do n’t get any medals for being a one club man			0
while you can still do it , then do it			0
i do n’t see him as a manager — and he does n’t need the money anyway			0
he ’d be good on tv			0
no , he ’d be a superstar			0
but that can come at a later date			0
he ’s still got the legs to play , to reinvent himself			0
he does n’t owe anything to anyone			0
walk out with your head held high , @entity142			0
