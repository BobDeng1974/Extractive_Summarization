@entity0 says @entity1 faces an impossible task in the @entity3 @entity1 is 29 points behind his team - mate going into @entity6 @entity0 thinks @entity1 is a faster driver , but not a cleverer one @entity1 faces an almost impossible task of winning this year ’s @entity8 , according to @entity0			1
the incomparable voice of @entity10 believes @entity1 ’s @entity12 team - mate @entity11 who holds the intellectual edge , and thus the advantage , in this most intense of intra-team battles			1
@entity1 heads into the @entity18 @entity17 — the 50th edition to be held at @entity6 — 29 points adrift of @entity11 as he bids to claim his second title			1
‘ @entity1 understandably and justifiably thinks that he should have been world champion more than once and the only reason he has n’t been is because @entity23 is a brilliant driver and was in a car that was much better than the rest , ’ said @entity0 , who celebrates his 91st birthday later this year			1
the more he is beaten by @entity11 , the more it could hypothetically hurt him emotionally , and that brings about more pressure			0
‘ with @entity11 being 29 points clear , he is more than a race win ahead of @entity1 , so even if he fails to finish at the @entity18 @entity17 and @entity1 wins , @entity11 is still going to be leading by four points			1
‘ in a nutshell it is going to be very , very difficult for @entity1 to win the championship because @entity11 is a thinking driver			2
@entity1 is faster but i do n’t think he is cleverer than @entity11			1
@entity11 is very bright indeed and he is a very good technician as well			0
’ @entity0 still keeps a close eye on the action on the track @entity1 ’s relationship with @entity11 hit rock bottom in may ’s @entity48 after the @entity49 accused his team - mate of deliberately running off the road during qualifying to scupper his final shot at pole			1
@entity11 , who was cleared of any wrongdoing by the stewards , went on to beat @entity1 to victory with the pair subsequently at the centre of a very public spat			0
‘ he felt he had been cheated out of a win , and we do n’t know , do we ? , ’ said @entity0 on @entity1 ’s surly demeanour in @entity61			2
‘ @entity1 appeared ( to think ) , and for all i know still thinks , that @entity11 did the dirty on him			2
so , it is very understandable he should be thoroughly fed up			0
@entity1 could struggle to cope with @entity11 's speed around @entity6 it is easy for people sitting at home watching the television to say : “ that ’s not very sporting is it ! ” well , why should he smile and embrace him ? i think his reaction was understandable but from the point of view of public relations , it was regrettable			2
’ mercedes have made every effort to repair the damage , with the pair back on talking terms at the races in @entity86 and @entity87			0
a mechanical failure in @entity89 followed by a qualifying spin in @entity87 , saw @entity1 lose 25 points to his rival despite a brilliant recovery to finish second after starting ninth at the @entity96 ring			2
but @entity1 , 29 , has n’t won at @entity6 for six years and was feisty when asked how he might cope if he did not clinch the title despite having the best car			1
relations between team - mates @entity1 and @entity11 have become strained this season @entity102 's @entity6 simulator ‘ that ’s not really something i want to think about or put out there , ’ he said			1
‘ why would i even consider it ? it ’s all about positive energy			0
’ and @entity0 believes such an outcome would n’t lead to a early exit from the sport as some have suggested			0
he added : ‘ @entity1 is pragmatic enough to be able to shrug his shoulders and say “ that is racing ” but he certainly wo n’t like it and why should he ? ‘ but he is not going to have a nervous breakdown and leave the sport			0
he enjoys it too much and he gets so much out of it psychologically and financially			0
@entity1 has done a hell of a lot for @entity10 , but @entity10 has done a hell of a lot for @entity1			0

@entity1 is 29 points behind his team - mate going into @entity6
@entity0 thinks @entity1 is a faster driver , but not a cleverer one
