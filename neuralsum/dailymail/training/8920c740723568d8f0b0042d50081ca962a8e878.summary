by @entity0 published : 09:53 est , 8 may 2013 updated : 11:46 est , 8 may 2013 forget printing your own photos , now you can print and make your own pinhole camera from a cereal box			1
an art graduate from @entity7 has designed a retro - looking pinhole camera made from cardboard , a paperclip and a soft drinks can			1
the camera , called @entity13 , which is @entity14 for ' to see ' , takes photos using medium - format film and is put together using folds and glue			2
photos are projected onto a strip of medium - format film when a cardboard flap is moved over the pinhole			1
inventor @entity29 is now selling the design kit so other people can make it too the design for @entity36 's cardboard pinhole camera was inspired by some of her favourite retro cameras			1
the camera does n't have a lens ; instead it has a hole which is covered by a cardboard insert			1
when the insert is removed , light travels through the hole and projects the photo on a strip of medium - format film a pinhole camera is a camera without a lens			1
it has a small hole in one side that acts as an aperture to let in light			2
when you point the camera at an object , light from the object travels through the hole and projects an inverted image on the film along the opposite side of the box			2
this technique is similar to how eyes see and process images			0
the smaller the hole , the sharper the image , yet the dimmer it will appear			2
a pinhole camera 's shutter is manually operated by a flap of card , for example			1
designer @entity29 is now selling the design so others can print and make their own @entity81 cameras at home			0
@entity36 , 24 from @entity84 in east @entity83 , came up with idea for the camera when she was a student in @entity7 three years ago			1
she said she knew she 'd never be able to afford a medium - format camera so designed a model that she could make herself			0
it was designed from different elements of @entity36 's favourite cameras			0
she said : ' it goes back to the basics of photography and teaches you the fundamentals			0
' ' it 's easy to use and the results are lovely '			0
she also designed a 35mm version of the camera			0
she offered the design for this smaller camera for free as a @entity105 download from her website			2
but @entity36 has now set up a @entity109 campaign so she can ship the cardboard designs , and all the materials needed to make the camera , to customers			2
examples of pictures taken using @entity36 's cardboard pinhole camera			1
@entity36 is hoping people who buy her camera will submit their own images to an online gallery the side view of the @entity13 pinhole camera			1
anyone who pledges to @entity36 's @entity109 campaign will get a free @entity105 download of a smaller pinhole camera design , also by @entity36 , that can also be printed and recreated from cardboard the @entity109 project ends on 18 may 2013			1
it has already received over £ 28,000 worth of funding , from more than 670 backers			1
once the funding for the project closes , @entity36 will print the die - cut kit onto thick recycled card			0
the kit wlll also come with instructions and a spare medium - format spool			0
@entity36 will also be producing an instructional video			0
photos taken using the camera will then be added to an online gallery , and can be submitted by @entity13 owners			0
however , @entity36 states on her @entity109 page that the kits wo n't be delivered until november			0
in the meantime , @entity36 has also designed a 35mm version of the camera and anyone who pledges to the fund will get a downloadable @entity105 of this kit			0
the film used in both camera designs will need to be processed either in a @entity81 dark room , or at a photography shop			0

the pinhole camera works by moving an insert over a hole in the front of the cardboard design
