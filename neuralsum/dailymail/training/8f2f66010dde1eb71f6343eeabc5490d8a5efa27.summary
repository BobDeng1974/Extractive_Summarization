by @entity0 published : 13:15 est , 15 february 2013 updated : 13:31 est , 16 february 2013 new cars sold in @entity5 and @entity6 risk catching fire and exploding in a crash because of @entity10 rules to impose a controversial ' green ' air - conditioning coolant from the start of this year , @entity2 car giant @entity1 has warned			1
the luxury car - maker says the new ' climate - friendly ' air - con chemical is ' highly flammable ' , poisonous and poses a danger both to occupants and rescue services – and @entity2 government officials now agree			1
@entity1 is refusing to put the controversial new gas refrigerant into its latest vehicles , sparking a major confrontation with @entity22 and the firms who make it - both of whom deny any safety risks			1
wheels on fire : @entity1 carried out their own tests on the coolants today , @entity1 and its parent company @entity32 received backing from @entity2 's @entity34			1
it asked the @entity10 to ' compromise ' by granting them and other car - makers – including @entity37 and @entity38 - an extension from the mandatory rules until 2015 if they agree to introduce an alternative green refrigerant based on carbon dioxide , which experts say is safer because it does n't burn			1
if @entity32 is correct , around 2 million new cars sold in the @entity5 each year are potentially at risk			0
photographs from the firm 's own simulated crash tests on cars showed that a mix of the refrigerant and air - conditioning compressor oil released under a car 's hood could ignite a heated engine			1
this would mainly be a risk if the car crashes , but it is also possible if the coolant leaks for any other reason			1
the row centres on the new coolant with the codename ' @entity66 ' which @entity32 argues can start a fire in the car and release toxic hydrogen fluoride gas			1
it is the replacement for the long - time industry standard , which @entity10 legislators in @entity22 have ordered to be phased out from january because of concerns about greenhouse gases			1
the new ' green ' refrigerant is produced by @entity79 giant @entity78 and is currently the only one if its kind that meets new @entity10 climate guidelines			1
the firm denies categorically that there is any safety risk			0
hot rod : mercedes say the @entity10 regulations will lead to accidents car makers are supposed to phase in the change from the start of this year , but by 2017 every single one of the estimated 14 million a year air - conditioned vehicles that rolls off assembly lines for sale in @entity6 will be filled with about £ 43 worth of the new coolant			1
this will not include the million @entity1 's built each year , of which 90,000 are sold in the @entity5			1
urging the @entity10 to compromise , @entity97 , president of @entity2 's @entity34 said : ' we have been warning about the dangers ( of @entity100 ) for years			1
@entity32 's internal tests proved not only that our own fears were justified but also that we may even have underestimated the risks			2
' but he added : ' it 's just not possible to switch to a co2 - based system within six months or even a year , though , so i would propose giving carmakers until the end of 2015 to make the switch			1
' mr @entity97 noted : ' if you switch to @entity112 then you reduce your global warming potential by 75 per cent over @entity66 , so i think that justifies permitting a longer transition time for those carmakers that commit to the switch , ' earlier this month , @entity118 joined @entity32 and @entity37 's @entity38 in resigning from an industry research group looking into the safety of @entity66 , due to concerns over the scientific thoroughness of the investigation			2
@entity1 officials said they were horrified by the results of the coolant leak tests @entity1 executives said they watched in horror when engineers at a test - track in @entity131 in @entity2 simulated a leak in the air - conditioning line of a @entity135 tourer using the new coolant			1
after releasing a fine mixture of the refrigerant and air - conditioning compressor oil which sprayed across the car 's turbo - charged 1.6 litre engine , they watched it ignite in ' a ball of fire ' before their eyes			1
the substance caught fire as soon as it hit the hot surface , releasing a toxic , corrosive gas as it burned			0
the car 's windshield turned milky white as lethal hydrogen fluoride began eating its way into the glass , said the firm			2
@entity156 , a senior @entity32 engineer who ran the tests said : ' we were frozen in shock , i am not going to deny it			2
' a @entity1 source said : ' in over half the tests , a significant fire occurred , which could endanger the lives of passengers and rescue teams			0
' it does n't explode like in the movies			0
but there is a boom and a ball of fire			0
' @entity1 source @entity175 , director of vehicle certification and regulatory affairs at @entity178 said : ' the whole vehicle can catch fire and the burning refrigerant generates acutely poisonous hydrogen fluoride which poses a severe danger to both passengers and rescue workers			0
' in sharp contrast , the existing refrigerant ' was proved to be safe under identical testing conditions , he said			0
@entity32 said in a statement : ' due to the new findings of this study and the high safety demands at @entity1 , this chemical will not be used in its products			2
' @entity2 carmaker @entity37 has also announced it is looking at an alternative carbon - dioxide ( @entity112 ) based coolant to the new ' green ' version			1
but @entity199 said parent company @entity32 were putting cost - cutting ahead of climate change remedies – charges the firm denies			1
liberal mep @entity202 told @entity6 magazine @entity203 that the firm was trying to ' frustrate ' the directive 's ambitions : ' @entity32 are evil and i think their ceo should be summoned to the @entity6 parliament and humiliated			2
' he said : ' @entity32 has apparently discovered that @entity66 is flammable			2
well so are petrol , oil and diesel			0
of course it 's flammable if you shove a flame thrower under it , which is more or less the test that @entity32 is said to have carried out			1
' @entity78 today countered the safety fears by publishing a report from safety experts @entity221 saying that their new air - con fluid ' posed no greater threat than any other engine compartment fluids			2
' it accused @entity1 of using ' unrealistic ' and ' extremely idealised ' testing conditions			0
@entity78 vice president @entity227 said the report left no doubt that their refrigerant ' is safe for automotive applications			0
' a spokesman for @entity5 's @entity234 ( @entity234 ) said it was taking seriously @entity1 's concerns , adding : ' at the forefront of all members thoughts is the safety of drivers and passengers in the vehicles they are putting on the market			2
' the additional research is welcome and members will be looking at the outcomes of that research closely			0
' @entity250 , managing director @entity248 , @entity78 said their new air conditioning refrigerant ‘ has been proven to be a safe and effective replacement			0
’ ‘ it is already in use by the auto industry			0
it reduces the global warming impact of automotive refrigerants by 99.7 per cent			0
‘ its adoption in cars today would have the greenhouse gas equivalent impact of removing more than 4 million cars from @entity6 roads			0
’ he added car - makers had six years to prepare to meet the requirements of the new directive and that ‘ the vast majority of automakers have taken the necessary steps to comply ’ he said @entity2 ’s @entity34 ( @entity275 ) ‘ only spreads misinformation ’ and said using carbon - dioxide was ‘ inefficient ’ and had ‘ short - comings ’ adding : ’ it has higher emissions when both the air - conditioning system and efficiency of the engine are accounted for			0
’ @entity281 , part of the giant @entity283 , said it was pressing ahead with plans to introduce the new coolant in its new cars			0
@entity283 ’ engineering manager for new refrigerants @entity289 told trade magazine @entity290 : ‘ we did crash tests , computer simulations and thermal analysis and did not observe any safety problems at all			0
‘ many have tried to repeat @entity32 's findings , but no one has come forward with anything that would indicate any concern			0

mercedes say the ' climate - friendly ' chemical is highly flammable
@entity22 and the coolant 's producers deny the *suggestion*
