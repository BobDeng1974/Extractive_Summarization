president @entity0 doubled down thursday on his handling of the sgt. @entity3 prisoner swap , saying he makes ' no apologies ' for releasing five @entity6 terrorists in exchange for the safe return of an accused @entity10 deserter			1
' i make absolutely no apologies for making sure we get back a young man to his parents , ' he said in @entity16 during a joint press conference with @entity19 prime minister @entity18 , ' and that the @entity21 people understand that this is somebody ’s child and that we do n’t condition whether or not we make the effort to try to get them back			1
' ' we had a prisoner of war whose health had deteriorated , and we were deeply concerned about [ him ] , ' @entity0 told reporters about sgt. @entity3			1
' and we saw an opportunity and we seized it			0
and i make no apologies for that			0
' hours later the @entity33 published claims that the administration told @entity21 senators that they were kept in the dark about the hostage swap because the @entity6 threatened to kill @entity3 if information about the negotiations was leaked			1
@entity78 was advised in 2011 and 2012 of two separate plans to make a similar deal , and nothing was leaked despite unanimous opposition on @entity83			1
@entity84 , the @entity86 @entity85 majority leader , was told in advance , and his staff did n't leak @entity0 's plans			1
' i ’m not sure i ’m the only one , ' @entity84 told reporters on thursday			2
' i mean , it 's a big deal over nothing			2
' saying he was unimpressed by concerns over the notification timeline in @entity78 , @entity84 channeled former secretary of state @entity97 's famous one - liner about the 2012 terror attack in @entity99 , @entity100			1
' is it friday or is it saturday ? ' he exclaimed			0
' what difference does it make ? what difference does it make ? ' the president also defended his decision in @entity16 to appear publicly on saturday with @entity3 's parents in a press conference that has become an embarrassing feature of the deepening controversy			1
' with respect to how we announced it , i think it 's important for people to realize that this is not some abstraction , ' @entity0 told reporters			2
' this is not a political football			0
' ' you have a couple of parents whose kid volunteered to fight in a distant land , who they had n't seen in five years , and were n't sure whether they 'd ever see again			0
and as commander - in - chief of the @entity21 armed forces , i am responsible for those kids			2
' @entity0 also pushed back against members of @entity78 – both @entity134 and @entity86 – for stirring up a hornet 's nest of opposition to his handling of the prisoner swap			1
' i 'm never surprised by controversies that are whipped up in @entity141 , right ? ' he said			0
' that 's par for the course			0
' @entity144 said thursday that no one would have forgiven the @entity21 > if the @entity60 had let @entity3 die in captivity @entity0 appeared with @entity19 pm @entity18 at the @entity45 meeting in @entity16 , an event originally slated for @entity149 , @entity150 but moved @entity151 because of @entity150 president @entity153 's invasion of @entity154 @entity156 @entity155 senator @entity155 and the 99 other @entity21 senators received a private briefing wednesday night from @entity0 administration officials about @entity3 's release -- a move designed to quell anger on @entity83 from members of @entity78 who were kept out of the loop a jocular @entity0 addressed a wide variety of foreign - affairs topics , but got the most attention for his continued defense of the @entity60 's actions in the @entity3 affair @entity0 has been widely accused of breaking a federal law that he signed in december , by failing to notify @entity78 30 days before releasing detainees from the military prison at @entity174 , @entity175			1
his administration has justified the action by citing fears about @entity3 's health			2
those concerns , according to a wide variety of news reports , were first raised when the @entity6 delivered a video to the @entity21 government in january showing a frail - looking @entity3 apparently in need of medical attention			2
however , some believe that video appears to have been a ploy to accelerate negotiations			0
in a subsequent video released by @entity6 forces tuesday night , @entity3 appeared strong and in good health when @entity194 retrieved him from his captors			1
@entity21 defense secretary @entity62 stood firm thursday on concerns for @entity3 's health , telling @entity198 that ' it was our judgement , based on the information that we had , that his life , his health were in peril			1
' ' can you imagine if we would have waited or taken the chance of leaks over a 30 - day period ? ' he asked			0
' i will tell you what i know and i made a judgement on this too – that would have seriously imperiled us ever getting him out			0
' @entity144 added that the decision inside the @entity60 to green - light the five - for - one hostage exchange was ' unanimous			1
' all 100 @entity21 senators attended a private closed - door briefing wednesday night with @entity0 administration officials , designed to quell anger on @entity83 among members of @entity78 upset about being out of the loop prior to the prisoner swap			1
party canceled : flags and balloons in @entity227 , @entity228 mark the release from captivity of local son sgt. @entity3 , but town leaders have canceled a planned party for the accused deserter , officially citing costs as the reason @entity238 sen. @entity237 ( r ) said he will file a bill in @entity78 next week that would block the @entity0 administration from releasing any more @entity174 prisoners like ' the @entity242 ' who were traded for @entity3 some senators said afterward that @entity3 did not ' look good ' in the january proof - of - life video , which they were shown during the meeting			1
' it appeared that he was drugged and that he was barely responsive , in the video itself , ' @entity247 vice-chair sen. @entity246 , a @entity134 from @entity248 , told reporters			0
@entity0 referred to the @entity85 briefing on thursday , saying that ' we ’re now explaining to @entity78 the details of how to move forward			2
' he said his administration had vaguely discussed with members of @entity78 the ' possibility that something like this might occur			0
' ' but because of the nature of the folks we were dealing with and the fragile nature of these negotiations , we felt it was important to go ahead and do what we did			0
' a 2013 law that @entity0 signed in december required @entity0 to provide chairmen of congressional intelligence and foreign affairs committees with 30 days ' notice before transferring @entity174 prisoners to foreign countries			2
@entity275 @entity274 sen. @entity274 said wednesday that @entity0 will face certain impeachment if he secretly released more prisoners in the same fashion			0
and wednesday night on the @entity281 ' @entity280 ' program , @entity238 @entity134 sen. @entity237 said he plans to introduce a bill formally stopping the transfer of any more detainees from the military prison camp			0
' i intend next week to file legislation to halt any releases from @entity174 until we get to the bottom of what happened in @entity3 , ' @entity237 said , ' and provide some real congressional oversight here , because it is really needed			0

@entity0 appeared in @entity16 alongside @entity19 prime minister @entity18 during a @entity45 meeting in @entity16
he *insisted* that ' we had a prisoner of war whose health had deteriorated , ' despite a fit - looking @entity3 who appeared in a @entity6 video during saturday 's hostage hand - over
administration officials reportedly told @entity21 senators wednesday that they weer kept in the dark because the @entity6 threatened to kill @entity3 if a prison - swap plan was leaked to the public
