president @entity22 wants @entity7 to be given @entity5 ‘ non-member observer status ’ , such as that enjoyed by the @entity25			2
this will give it a greater presence at the @entity5			0
the crunch vote will come at the @entity30 , where the majority of countries including @entity33 , are sympathetic to the @entity7			1
members of the @entity35 will not have a veto on the issue , which makes it likely that a resolution will be passed in the teeth of opposition from @entity13 and the @entity42			0
mr @entity2 told @entity43 : ‘ up until the time of the vote itself , we will remain open to voting in favour of the resolution , if we see public assurances by the @entity7 on these points			1
‘ in the absence of these assurances , the @entity3 would abstain on the vote			1
this would be consistent with our strong support for the principle of @entity7 statehood , but our strong concern that the resolution could set the peace process back , ’ he told the @entity57 in a statement			1
’ he insisted 2013 would be a crucial year for negotiations , adding that there were up to two years left to broker the deal			0

mr @entity85 added : ‘ statehood for the @entity7 is not a gift to be given , but a right to be acknowledged			0
‘ i warn the foreign secretary , if the @entity3 abstains tomorrow it will not be a measure of our growing influence , it will be a confirmation of our growing irrelevance to meaningful engagement in the search for peace			2
