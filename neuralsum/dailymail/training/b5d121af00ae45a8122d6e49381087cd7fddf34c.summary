a dental assistant fired for being too attractive was sent text messages by her bosses asking how often she ' experiences orgasms '			1
@entity4 , 32 , was sent the raunchy text by @entity7 dentist @entity6 around six months before she was sacked			1
documents from the @entity9 show @entity6 had previously made inappropriate comments at work about his employee 's clothing being too tight or distracting			1
fired : @entity4 was so attractive , @entity7 dentist @entity6 fired her out of fear she 'd make him want to stray from his marriage hello ladies : despite @entity17 being 21 years younger than him , married , and ' not interested in a relationship , ' @entity6 believed it would be too hard not to start an affair with her justices wrote : ' dr @entity6 acknowledges he once told @entity17 that if she saw his pants bulging , she would know her clothing was too revealing			1
' dr @entity6 's lawyers argue it was mrs @entity4 who acted inappropriately and that is why she was fired			1
attorney @entity30 said : ' she ’s an attractive lady			0
dr. @entity6 found her behavior and dress to be inappropriate			0
' but mrs @entity4 said she was shocked to discover the reasons behind her sacking			1
she told @entity35 : ' i was very surprised after working so many years side by side i did n’t have any idea that that would have crossed his mind			0
' ms @entity4 has also slammed the court ' s ' completely wrong ' decision to rule in favour of dr @entity44 said : ' i think it is sending a message that men can do whatever they want in the work force ' the court ruled 7 - 0 on friday that bosses can sack employees they see as an ' irresistible attraction , ' even if they have not engaged in flirtatious behavior or otherwise done anything wrong			1
appearing on @entity54 friday night , assistant mrs @entity4 said the decision was deeply unfair			1
' i do n't think this is fair , ' she said from her @entity7 home by phone			0
' i do n't think this is right			0
' such firings may be unfair , but they are not unlawful discrimination under the @entity63 because they are motivated by feelings and emotions , and not gender , justice @entity60 wrote			0
content : happily married with children @entity17 said she saw @entity6 as a father figure and had ' absolutely ' no interest in him romantically an attorney for the @entity74 dentist said the decision , the first of its kind in @entity7 , is a victory for family values because @entity6 fired @entity17 in the interest of saving his marriage , not because she was a woman			2
but @entity17 's attorney said @entity7 's all - male high court , one of only a handful in the nation , failed to recognize the discrimination women see routinely in the workplace			1
@entity17 insisted she was never interested in @entity6 romantically , regardless of his own feelings			0
' absolutely not , ' she said			0
' i 'm happily married			0
' since @entity6 fired her she has worked as a waitress six nights a week			0
while her former boss claimed her clothes were so tight he could n't look at her without being aroused , @entity17 said the only outfit she wore to work was standard scrubs worn by many nurses and assistants in dental offices			1
asked if she saw herself as irresistibly attractive , @entity17 laughed at the question			0
family man : @entity6 's wife , who also works in the dental office , demanded @entity17 be fired when she discovered text messages ' i 'm just an ordinary girl , ' she said			1
' just an ordinary mom			0
' also appearing via call - in , her attorney , @entity111 , said it was unlikely they would seek an appeal because of the way the case was filed as only interpreting state law			0
' these judges sent a message to @entity7 women that they do n't think men can be held responsible for their sexual desires and that @entity7 women are the ones who have to monitor and control their bosses ' sexual desires , ' @entity120 said			0
' if they get out of hand , then the women can be legally fired for it			0
' @entity17 , 32 , worked for @entity6 for 10 years , and he considered her a stellar worker			0
but in the final months of her employment , he complained that her tight clothing was distracting , once telling her that if his pants were bulging that was a sign her clothes were too revealing , according to the opinion			1
he also once allegedly remarked about her infrequent sex life by saying , ' that 's like having a @entity146 in the garage and never driving it			2
' ' that 's like having a @entity146 in the garage and never driving it			2
' @entity6 and @entity17 — both married with children — started exchanging text messages , mostly about personal matters , such as their families			2
@entity6 's wife , who also worked in the dental office , found out about the messages and demanded @entity17 be fired			2
the @entity158 consulted with their pastor , who agreed that terminating @entity17 was appropriate			0
@entity6 fired @entity17 and gave her one month 's severance			1
he later told @entity17 's husband he worried he was getting too personally attached and feared he would eventually try to start an affair with her			2
ordinary mom : @entity17 has been working as a waitress since she lost her dental job and is unsure of her future career path @entity17 was stunned because she viewed the 53 - year - old @entity6 as a father figure and had never been interested in starting a relationship , @entity111 said			0
@entity17 filed a lawsuit alleging gender discrimination , arguing she would not have been terminated if she was male			0
she did not allege sexual harassment because @entity6 's conduct may not have risen to that level and did n't particularly offend her , @entity111 said			2
' the motives behind dr. @entity6 terminating mrs. @entity4 were quite clear : he did so to preserve his marriage			1
@entity6 argued @entity17 was fired not because of her gender , but because her continued employment threatened his marriage			0
a district judge agreed , dismissing the case before trial , and the high court upheld that ruling			2
@entity60 noted that @entity6 had an all - female workforce and @entity17 was replaced by a woman			0
he said the decision was in line with state and federal court rulings that found workers can be fired for relationships that cause jealousy and tension within a business owner 's family			1
one such case from the 8th @entity198 upheld a business owner 's firing of a valued employee who was seen by his wife as a threat to their marriage			1
in that case , the fired employee had engaged in flirtatious conduct			0
jurisprudence : justice @entity60 penned the @entity9 's decision on @entity6 's dismissal of @entity4 @entity60 said allowing @entity17 's lawsuit would stretch the definition of discrimination to allow anyone fired over a relationship to file a claim arguing they would not have been fired but for their gender			1
@entity6 's attorney , @entity30 , said the court got it right			1
the decision clarified that bosses can make decisions showing favoritism to a family member without committing discrimination ; in this case , by allowing @entity6 to honor his wife 's wishes to fire @entity17 , he said			1
@entity6 is a very religious and moral individual , and he sincerely believed that firing @entity17 would be best for all parties , he said			2
' while there was really no fault on the part of mrs. @entity4 , it was just as clear the decision to terminate her was not related to the fact that she was a woman , ' he said			1
' the motives behind dr. @entity6 terminating mrs. @entity4 were quite clear : he did so to preserve his marriage			1
' i do n't view this as a decision that was either pro-women or opposed to women rights at all			2
in my view , this was a decision that followed the appropriate case law			2

@entity4 was sent raunchy text six month before she was sacked
@entity252 said his ' pants would bulge ' if mrs @entity4 's clothes were too revealing
mrs @entity4 said court decision in favour of sacking is ' completely wrong '
she said the boss ' reasons for firing her came as a surprise
