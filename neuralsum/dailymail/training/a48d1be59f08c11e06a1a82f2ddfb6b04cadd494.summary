by @entity0 published : 20:04 est , 10 march 2014 updated : 04:32 est , 11 march 2014 @entity2 was at the end of his tether			1
for three years he had suffered from painful swelling in his left leg , which started at the top of his thigh but spread right down to his ankle and then , in january this year , to his groin and abdomen			0
@entity2 has lymphoedema , a chronic disorder that occurs when the lymph system - a network of tiny vessels that drains fluid , or lymph , from the tissue and back into the bloodstream - does n't function properly			1
this leads to a build - up of fluid , causing swelling , pain , loss of mobility and increased risk of infection			0
then @entity2 learnt about an unlikely remedy - @entity31 tape			1
this is the brightly coloured tape athletes , such as @entity35 footballer @entity34 , use to help prevent muscle injury , but it is increasingly being used by specialists caring for people with lymphoedema			1
after three weeks of treatment , @entity2 's swelling has been dramatically reduced			1
@entity35 footballer @entity34 ( right ) , used @entity45 tape to help prevent muscle injury , but it is increasingly being used by specialists caring for people with lymphoedema , like @entity2 ( left ) around 200,000 @entity48 are thought to suffer from the condition			1
it occurs either as a result of an abnormality from birth - ' primary ' lymphoedema - or , more typically , when the lymph system is damaged or blocked as a result of surgery , injury , obesity or cancer treatment			1
in cancer patients it usually affects the arms and legs , as the lymph nodes - small glands connected to the lymph vessels that collect bacteria and other harmful substances in the lymph fluid - are commonly removed to stop the disease spreading			2
@entity2 developed lymphoedema in 2010 after surgery to remove a few cancerous lymph nodes in his groin			1
two years previously he 'd had a malignant mole removed from his left calf and it was thought that cancer cells had travelled up his leg			0
' after the operation the top of my left leg blew up like a balloon , ' says the 63 - year - old biomedical scientist , who lives with his wife @entity84 , 66 , in @entity85 , @entity86			1
' i found it hard to walk and could n't drive			0
' every day for five months he had to go to hospital to have a litre of fluid drained from his @entity91 the swelling eventually subsided , @entity2 says : ' i jumped into my car and drove to @entity94 to see a friend - i was finally free			1
' but a few weeks later the lymphoedema returned , now affecting his whole leg			2
he was referred to a lymphoedema clinic at his local hospital , where he was given compression stockings , bandages and manual lymphatic drainage - massage to encourage lymph fluid to leave the swollen area.but he found these had a limited effect and the compression garments and bandages could be uncomfortable			1
then , early last year , ct scans revealed new tumours in his groin			0
after three weeks of treatment , @entity2 's swelling has been dramatically reduced because these were blocking lymph nodes , fluid gradually built up in his abdomen and scrotum and worsened in his upper leg			1
finally , fed up with the wait at the clinic , in january he went private and was offered @entity121 tape is essentially elastic cotton tape with a medical adhesive on the back			2
for athletes , applying it over injured muscles is thought to stop them overstretching and returns the muscle to a neutral position , relaxing it and preventing further injury			1
with lymphoedema , applying it to stretched skin ' lifts ' the skin , reducing pressure on the lymphatic system underneath - this encourages lymph fluid to drain , explains @entity138 , a lymphoedema specialist nurse based in @entity140			1
this is different from compression garments , which encourage fluid into the lymphatic system by applying compression ( or pressure )			1
a @entity148 study , published in 2009 , showed that @entity45 taping worked as well in women with breast cancer - related lymphoedema as bandages , and was easier to use and more comfortable			1
' @entity45 taping is particularly helpful in problem areas such as the top of the arm or leg , or the breast , where compression garments do n't cover or can not be fitted easily , ' says @entity138			2
' lots of my patients swear by @entity45 taping , ' says @entity162 , a consultant plastic surgeon with a special interest in lymphoedema at the @entity166 , and @entity168 @entity167 , both in @entity169			1
@entity2 underwent three weeks of intense treatment where @entity31 tape was applied to his thigh , reaching up to above his belly button and over his groin			1
it was removed and replaced every two days - ' i barely felt it , ' he says			0
at the end of the treatment his leg was 8in smaller in circumference - ' it had contained a stone of fluid and that 's gone , so it looks the same as my other leg and there is no fluid in my abdomen or scrotum , ' says @entity2			2
' now i can do all the things i could n't before , such as driving , running and playing football - i can live a normal life			0
' he still uses compression stockings to encourage fluid to move to working lymph nodes , but these only reach his thigh , so he uses them in conjunction with @entity198 taping in other areas			0
thanks to the tape , he no longer needs constrictive bandages			2
but while @entity204 , a consultant nurse in cancer and supportive care , who runs the lymphoedema service at @entity208 , agrees that @entity45 taping may help , she says patients must be fully assessed before treatment			1
for a lot of people @entity45 taping can help to control lymphoedema but it is n't a standalone treatment , adds @entity217 , chief executive of the @entity219 charity			1
it must be done by a skilled therapist , says @entity138 : ' they need to know where the fluid is draining to and be able to follow the lymphatic pathways			2
' there are also surgical treatments for lymphoedema			0
liposuction can help by removing the fatty deposits that build up with the fluid over time as a result of accumulation of proteins and other changes to the tissue			0
this fat ca n't be pushed away with massage or bandaging			0
the lymphoedema returned , now affecting his whole leg however , while liposuction can help if compression stockings are put on straight after the fat is removed , it does n't correct the problem in the lymph system			2
for severe cases @entity162 offers lymph node transfer , where healthy nodes are removed and transplanted to the problem area , though this is not yet approved by the @entity255 ( @entity255 )			0
ms @entity162 's concern is the ' postcode lottery ' across the @entity48 for access to treatment : ' many people are forced to spend thousands to go private - some of my patients even go to @entity265			0
' it 's seen as only a complication of surgery			0
and there 's an attitude that cancer patients should n't moan because their life has been saved by treatment that has given them lymphoedema , when it 's a completely debilitating condition			0
people get infections constantly , ca n't work , ca n't wear clothes they want and it affects self - esteem			0
' lymphoedema is ' under - recognised and complex ' , agrees @entity204			0
' if it 's diagnosed early , treatment can be very effective but this is often not the case			0
' furthermore , the @entity219 says those with non-cancer - related lymphoedema - at least half of all patients - find it harder to get treatment because the @entity255 guidelines only cover cancer patients , particularly those with breast cancer ( one in five develop lymphoedema )			0
@entity2 considers himself lucky to have been able to afford private treatment			2
he is delighted with @entity45 taping and now plans to go on holiday			2
he says : ' i 'm going to enjoy wearing shorts this summer			0

@entity2 , 63 , from @entity85 , has lymphoedema and uses @entity45 tape
athletes like @entity34 use it to stop injured muscles overstretching
applying to stretched skin reduces pressure on lymphatic system
