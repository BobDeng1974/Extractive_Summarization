a girl guide group faces being thrown out of the national association after refusing to force members to drop @entity3 from the oath			1
troop leaders have rejected new rules saying that the inclusion of @entity3 should not be compulsory but a matter of personal choice			2
but they have now been sent an ‘ aggressive ’ letter ordering them to back down or leave @entity12 at the end of the month			1
critics branded the approach a ‘ move for exclusion ’			2
@entity18 ( centre ) leader of the 37th @entity21 at @entity22 said the new pledge ' sidelined ' @entity24			1
she is pictured with guides @entity26 , 14 , ( left ) and @entity27 , 12 ( right ) the @entity28 was altered earlier this year so that members now swear ‘ to be true to myself and develop my beliefs ’ rather than the original ‘ to love my @entity3 ’			1
but @entity18 , 55 , who has been leading the 37th @entity21 in @entity33 for more than 25 years , said the new pledge ‘ sidelined ’ @entity24			1
mrs @entity18 , added : ‘ this is an example of people not realising the importance of faith , of all faiths , in our community			1
' i would go as far as saying that it is an example of faith being sidelined in society			0
’ ‘ i imagine changing the pledge was intended to include more people , but what it is actually doing is excluding those who have faith			2
‘ i understand why an atheist might not want to make a promise to @entity3 , and that is fine by me , but it has to be up to the individual			0
’ mrs @entity18 and the other leaders of the group slammed the new pledge as a ‘ fridge magnet promise that does n’t really mean anything ’			1
the girl guide promise had been changed after over 100 years of tradition but chief guide @entity59 insisted the move ‘ opened our arms to welcome even more girls and adults , of all faiths – and none ’			2
the words ‘ to be true to myself and develop my beliefs ’ have replaced ‘ to love my @entity3 ’ , and the words ‘ to serve the @entity69 and my community ’ will replace ‘ to serve the @entity69 and my country ’			1
@entity74 ’s chief commissioner in the @entity75 has told the group their membership of the organisation will be ended on december 31			0
it means that the unit , which includes more than 100 girls in @entity82 , @entity83 , guides and @entity85 from a variety of different faiths , will now have to meet as an independent group			0
she added : ‘ this letter , which is surprisingly aggressive , says that we " will not use " the new promise and that simply is n’t true			1
‘ we would use this new form of words but we do want the children to have the choice to say the old promise if they want to			0
’ mrs @entity18 wants @entity74 to take the same stance as the @entity100 ’ pledge , which says a member will ‘ uphold our scout values ’ and can be taken by those who do not choose to vow to ‘ do my duty to @entity3 ’			1
she added : ‘ they are trying to force us out of @entity74 with no process and with only three weeks ’ notice			0
the girls are really incredibly angry and they just want their voices to be heard			0
’ chief guide @entity59 said : ‘ girl guiding is extremely sorry to hear of any guide group leaving our organisation			2
‘ by changing the wording of our promise , after an extensive consultation with over 44,000 people , we have opened our arms to welcome even more girls and adults - of all faiths and none - who will benefit from all the fantastic things we do in girl guiding			0
‘ we hope the new wording will help us reach out to girls and women who might not have considered guiding before , so that even more girls can benefit from everything guiding can offer			0
’ @entity132 , the vicar of @entity22 , wrote in the church ’s monthly newsletter : ‘ the hard reality is that this new promise is , whether intentionally or not , a move for exclusion			0
’ the changing of the guide promise earlier this year sparked 839 official complaints from members amid fears of a split in the movement			2
in august , one troop in @entity148 , @entity149 , vowed to resist the change but was forced to back down by national leaders .			0

@entity21 branch received ' aggressive ' letter ordering them to comply
guide leader , @entity18 , said new pledge ' sidelines ' *christianity*
' to love my *god* ' has been replaced with ' to develop my beliefs '
