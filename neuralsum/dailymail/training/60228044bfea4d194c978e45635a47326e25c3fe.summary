by @entity0 unwell : @entity2 claims he contracted cholera after staying in a three - star hotel in @entity5 a holidaymaker is launching legal action against a travel company claiming his break to @entity5 was ruined after he contracted cholera			1
@entity2 was on a romantic getaway with his partner @entity12 when he claims to have been hit by the infection , which is usually confined to @entity16 countries			1
the 47 - year - old alleges he suffered diarrhoea throughout the Â£ 1,488 , 12 - day break at the @entity20 , and was doubled over in pain throughout the trip			1
mr @entity2 believed it to be food poisoning but visited a doctor when the symptoms continued after he returned home to be diagnosed with cholera - a bacterial infection caused by eating food which has been in contact with faeces			1
the architect , from @entity34 , @entity35 , said the first thing the couple noticed when they arrived at the three - star hotel in september 2013 , was the smell of ' raw sewage '			2
' we arrived in the middle of the night , and the first thing we noticed was the smell of raw sewage - it was absolutely unbelievable , ' he said			2
' halfway through the holiday we 'd had enough and the travel rep , to their credit , moved us to the other side of the complex so the sea wind would waft it away			0
' even then , when we went down to the pool area , we had to pinch our noses with our finger and thumb			0
' mr warned also claimed that part - way through the holiday , which was booked with @entity60 , the hotel 's all - inclusive restaurant had to be closed			1
but he claims by then he had already fallen unwell			0
bad smell : the couple claim the three - star @entity20 smelled of raw sewage when they arrived holiday resort : the @entity20 where mr @entity2 claims he contracted cholera while on holiday ' after a few days we got back and i still felt ill so went to the doctors , ' mr @entity2 said			1
' they took a stool sample , and a week later told me i had cholera - i was utterly gobsmacked			0
' when i went back , the doctor told me the fact i was able to visit him a week previous that i was through the worst			0
' i remember him saying if i was going to die , i would have done so by then			0
' the couple contacted @entity60 but said they were unhappy with the tour operator 's response , and as such have launched civil action through solicitors @entity86			1
@entity2 said : ' @entity60 tried to tell us nobody else had complained about being ill , but we knew of at least six more people were hit by the bacteria			1
popular resort : @entity94 beach in @entity5 , near to where the couple stayed ' even if they did n't complain to the travel operator , everybody was talking about it around the pool			0
' the hotel was without doubt the worst i 've ever had the misfortune of staying in			0
' @entity105 , specialist travel lawyer with @entity86 , said : ' this was meant to be a relaxing and romantic getaway but instead the holiday was ruined when @entity2 was left severely ill with a potentially life threatening illness			1
' the accommodation for the guests was clearly not of an acceptable standard which ultimately resulted in @entity2 becoming very ill. ' the cholera not only ruined the holiday but has already left him with a severe case of irritable bowel syndrome which persists to this day and is making his life very difficult			2
' it is simply unacceptable that any holidaymaker should have to suffer this way			0
' a spokeswoman for @entity60 said : ' the health and safety of our customers is always our primary concern , so we were naturally very concerned to hear that mr @entity2 became unwell while he was on holiday with us			2
' as we are in the process of liaising directly with mr @entity2 's legal representative in relation to this , we are unable to provide any further comment at this time so as not to unduly influence any possible future legal proceedings			2
' only 12 cases of cholera were reported in @entity139 and @entity140 in 2012 and the last major outbreak seen in @entity142 claimed 250,000 lives between 1881 and 1896 .			0
