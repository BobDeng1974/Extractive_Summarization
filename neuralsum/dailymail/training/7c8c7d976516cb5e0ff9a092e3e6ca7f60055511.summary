by @entity0 published : 19:53 est , 29 august 2013 updated : 10:05 est , 30 august 2013 a 17 - year - old gang - rape survivor 's insistence on justice has led a blackballing by her community and , it is alleged , her mother 's murder			1
the girl from @entity9 in the @entity11 state of @entity12 , who can not be named , has been shunned by neighbours since accusing two men of a higher caste of raping her			1
even in a country racked with guilt over violence towards women , she and her father claim they have faced official indifference - and even obstruction - to their efforts to see the suspects sent to jail			2
ostracised for seeking justice : the girl from @entity9 in the @entity11 state of @entity12 , who can not be named , has been shunned by neighbours since accusing two men of a higher caste of raping her the victim was 16 when she was snatched from the street as she walked to school and raped by two men in a moving car			1
she reported the attack to the police but three weeks later , on a date etched on to the wall of her home , her mother disappeared			1
two days later she was found dead in canal			2
doctors said she too was raped before she was murdered			1
now the teenager 's fight to see the men accused of her rape sent to jail has pitted her and her family against a hostile neighbourhood			1
they are @entity52 , @entity11 's lowest caste who are derided as ' untouchables ' ; the suspects , who police say also raped and killed her mother , are upper caste			1
@entity12 is at the front line of @entity11 's rape epidemic			1
at one point last year , two women were raped every single day in the state , which has a population of 25.3million			1
but despite a high - profile national political drive for greater safety for women and girls on @entity11 's streets , rape convictions remain difficult to secure - a situation worsened by the politics of the country 's caste system			1
' we did n't compromise , that 's why everyone is angry with us ' : the victim 's widowed father , a day labourer , said neighbours had repeatedly told them to drop the charges against the suspects , who are from the upper caste the victim 's widowed father , a day labourer , said neighbours had repeatedly told them to drop the charges			1

the government gave him four lakh ( Â£ 4,668 ) compensation for his wife 's murder and the rape of his daughter last year			1
that money has now all been spent on lawyers for the case which still drags on in a ' fast - track ' court			2
to compound matters , he believes that a police officer related to one of the accused tampered with evidence that is crucial to the prosecution			2
the young victim now hopes to find salvation through education - although she struggles to afford school books for his daughter , her insistence at speaking out has had terrible consequences			2
' no one speaks to me , ' she told @entity11 news network @entity121			0
' i do n't talk to them			0
i just stay at home			0
what is the point ? ' nobody talks nicely to me			0
even my uncle bad - mouths me			0
it would be better to just leave this village			0
