by @entity0 @entity2 's mother @entity1 , 32 , a nurse , decided to donate his organs to help save other lives as 12 - year - old @entity7 lay on a life - support machine , his parents sat beside him and stroked his hands			1
they told @entity2 they loved him and then , with tears of disbelief , said goodbye			2
they walked on either side of their son as he was wheeled towards theatre , in the agonising knowledge that the operation @entity2 was about to have would not save his own life , but that of other people			2
the previous day @entity2 , who was born with a heart defect , had undergone major surgery			1
but catastrophic bleeding at the start of the operation had starved @entity2 's brain of oxygen and he was pronounced brain dead			2
in the midst of almost unimaginable grief , his mother @entity1 and father @entity30 were asked if they were willing to donate their son 's organs			1
' it would be selfish not to give others a chance of life , ' says @entity30 , 35 , a civil servant			1
' as painful as the process was , we were determined to view it as a positive decision			2
' it 's now a year since @entity2 's death , and while the family 's grief is still raw , they are proud of the fact their son 's kidneys , liver and pancreas have helped save three other people 's lives			2
' no matter how poorly @entity2 was , he remained positive			2
he was such a loving , brave boy and i would do anything to have him back , says @entity1 , 32 , an orthopaedic nurse			1
' but there was never any doubt that i would donate his organs , to spare other parents the heartache we are going through			1
' yet figures released yesterday to mark @entity66 suggest many other families would behave differently : 45 per cent of people refuse to donate their loved one 's organs because they do n't know what that person wanted ; the figure rises to 47 per cent for children			1
in the past five years , 112 children have died because no donor organ was available			1
currently , 149 under - 18s in the @entity78 are waiting for an organ			2
according to @entity81 , the authority responsible for organ donations , many parents are driven by a misplaced desire to protect their children , even after their death			2
' i think some also mistakenly believe not as much effort will go into saving their child 's life because their organs are needed , ' adds @entity1			1
' but i ca n't stress enough how important it is that they donate			1
it is the right thing to do			2
' although children 's organs are mainly used for other children , they can also be given to adults depending on the organ needed			1
so one of @entity2 's kidneys and his pancreas saved a woman in her 40s , his other kidney helped a woman in her 20s and his liver saved a teenage boy			2
' @entity2 was simply excited that he was having an operation to make him better , ' says @entity1 ' knowing i had saved someone else 's child , especially , gave me strength , ' says @entity1 , through tears			1
@entity2 was diagnosed with congenital heart disease - a defect in the structure of his heart - soon after his birth in may 2001			2
his lips had turned blue and he was transferred to the paediatric unit at @entity127			2
scans showed that the blood vessels in his heart were in the wrong place , while a blockage was obstructing blood flow to his lungs			2
the wall dividing the left and right lower chambers of his heart was also faulty			2
as a result blood was not being pumped properly around his body , causing cyanosis - where the skin turns blue because of poor circulation - and fatigue			2
doctors warned @entity30 and @entity1 that , as @entity2 grew up , he would need operations to improve the efficacy of his heart			1
if these were successful , his life expectancy could still be normal			2
in the meantime he would need to take aspirin every day to thin his blood so that it could circulate better			2
@entity30 , from @entity150 , @entity151 , says : ' we clung to the hope that @entity2 could still lead a normal life - especially as he developed healthily as a baby			1
' in fact , at six months @entity2 was deemed robust enough to endure a nine - hour operation to have a shunt - a 3cm tube - fitted in his heart to create a detour from the heart to the lungs , so blood picks up more oxygen and circulation is improved			2
the operation was a success and @entity2 blossomed			0
' he occasionally grew tired if he over-exerted himself , but refused to let it hold him back , ' says @entity30			1
' he took his first steps at a year and thrived at school			0
' ( although @entity30 and @entity1 separated when @entity2 was 12 months old , they remained friends and shared custody of their son )			1
but in 2008 @entity2 , then seven , fell and cut his arm			0
although only a small 2cm graze , within days he developed flu - like symptoms , caused by an infection in his blood that travelled to his heart			0
the following month he was diagnosed with endocarditis - a potentially fatal heart infection			0
@entity2 spent three months in hospital on an intravenous antibiotic drip			0
though the infection cleared up , his heart had become weaker			0
@entity1 says : ' his condition could have deteriorated anyway			1
we 'll never know if the cut was the cause			0
' @entity2 grew so lethargic that she had to drive him the half - mile to school			0
' if he exerted himself he would turn blue or throw up , ' says @entity30			1
' @entity2 dreamt of being a footballer and asked why he could n't run around like his friends			0
it made us constantly anxious			0
' in january 2010 @entity2 underwent surgery to have a large vein connected directly to an artery , bypassing the heart so blood could go straight into the lungs to be oxygenated			1
but his condition continued to deteriorate and last year his consultant said he needed another , similar procedure			0
this was the only treatment option left - without it , he would need a heart transplant			0
' we never talked about this with @entity2			0
we thought he was too young to understand , ' says @entity1			1
they were warned the operation carried a risk of brain damage , internal bleeding and infection			0
' because his life expectancy was limited anyway , we did n't feel we had a choice , ' says @entity1			1
the 12 - hour operation took place on june 12 last year			1
' @entity2 was simply excited that he was having an operation to make him better			0
i told him i loved him and promised that everything would be ok , ' says @entity30			1
@entity2 's father @entity30 says it would have been hypocritical to say no but early on in the procedure , surgeons discovered @entity2 's heart lining had fused to his ribcage			1
opening the ribs caused his heart to bleed , and in the time it took for surgeons to stop the bleeding , @entity2 's brain was starved of oxygen			0
his consultant told @entity2 's parents he had suffered an irreversible brain injury			0
' it was a nightmare i could n't comprehend , ' says @entity1			1
' i screamed and vomited			0
' their son was pronounced brain dead at 3am on june 13			0
shortly afterwards , a specialist organ donation nurse - on call in every hospital - asked @entity2 's parents whether they 'd let his organs be used to help others live			1
' given that @entity2 would have needed a transplant , it would have been hypocritical to say no , ' says @entity30			1
aside from @entity2 's heart and lungs which were damaged , the couple agreed to donate everything else except his corneas			1
' his blue eyes were so sparkly , ' says @entity30			1
' they reminded me of how happy he had been and i could n't stand the thought of them being taken away			0
' by 6pm the transplant nurse had found three recipients for @entity2 's kidneys , pancreas and liver			0
the process is time - sensitive as organs do n't last for long outside the body			1
a liver can survive between six and eight hours before transplant , a pancreas 12 hours and a kidney up to 24 hours			1
@entity2 was kept on the life - support machine until that evening and the recipients had been prepared for surgery in other hospitals			2
as his parents kept a vigil by his bedside , a nurse cut a lock of his strawberry - blond hair for them to keep and created @entity2 's handprints out of clay			0
then the family was moved into a private room to say goodbye			0
' we kissed him and told him we loved him , ' says @entity30			1
' i had promised @entity2 he would be ok and he was n't			0
i felt i had failed my son			0
' at @entity2 's funeral , the 200 guests were banned from wearing black			0
' we wanted it to be a celebration of life and the love everyone felt for @entity2 , ' says @entity30			1
' i miss everything about him , from the way he bounded into bed with me in the morning for a cuddle to the @entity300 football matches we watched together			0
' @entity1 has kept @entity2 's bedroom untouched			1
sometimes she sits amid his @entity304 books and football posters , inhaling the boyish scent still on his dressing gown			0
' i still wake up some mornings and for a few seconds forget my beautiful boy is not here , ' she says			0
' my heart is broken			0
' last month , on the anniversary of @entity2 's death , the couple received a card from the lady who had received @entity2 's kidney and pancreas			0
she wrote about how sorry she was for what had happened to @entity2 , and said she would be for ever in their debt			0
' we were incredibly touched , ' says @entity1			1
' i feel ready to meet the recipients now - i think it would give me hope			0
' adds @entity30 : ' we would do anything to have @entity2 back			1
but knowing he has helped others means his legacy lives on			0
' if you would like to help @entity2 's family raise money for the @entity332 , go to broken - hearts.co.uk			0
@entity333 : to join the @entity334 , go to organdonation.nhs.uk or call 0300 123 23 23 .			0
