we think of them as thriving in wildflower meadows and rolling fields			0
but new research suggests @entity6 ’s bees are happier near towns and cities			2
a study of wildlife sites across four @entity12 counties has found that most are home to fewer species of bee today than they were in the past			1
it found that the expansion of farmland has actually been more damaging to @entity6 ’s bee population than the concreting over of the countryside for housing			1
a @entity25 researcher has said that bees prefer cities to fields ( honey bees in @entity30 shown )			1
the expansion of farmland has actually been damaging to bee population , according to the researcher			1
wildlife sites in four @entity12 counties saw bee species decrease for instance , heaths and meadows near @entity38 now boast more species of bee than sites in more rural areas			1
@entity25 researcher dr @entity44 believes intensive agriculture is to blame			1
climate change could be disrupting the relationship between bees and plants			2
that 's according to a study that said warmer springs can change the life cycles of bees , which can throw them out of sync with the plants they pollinate the research is the first clear example of the potential for climate change to disrupt such critical relationships between species			2
the study , @entity66 in a @entity67 by @entity68 , was carried out by the @entity69 ( @entity69 ) and was published in the journal @entity71			0
while the gardens , parks and churchyards of towns and cities provide bees with a variety of plants to forage on and an extended flowering season , popular crops such as oilseed rape only bloom for a few weeks			2
she said : ‘ while concreting over the countryside may appear to be bad news for nature , we ’ve found that progressive urbanisation may be much less damaging than intensive agriculture			0
‘ urban areas may benefit bees more than farmland by providing a wide variety of flowering plants , providing a cosmopolitan menu for insects from spring through to autumn			1
‘ over the past century rural landscapes in @entity6 have become increasingly dominated by large expanses of monoculture - the growing of a single type of plant , which has helped boost crop production			0
‘ but without a mixture of habitat and food sources , rural areas can sometimes be little better than green deserts for biodiversity			0
' scientists around the country are trying to work out why populations of bees and other insects are plummeting			0
pesticides , climate change and disease may , like intensive farming , be playing a role			0
the latest research is published in the @entity123 journal @entity124 dr @entity44 believes intensive agriculture is to blame			0
while the gardens , parks and churchyards of towns and cities provide bees with a variety of plants to forage on and an extended flowering season , popular crops such as oilseed rape only bloom for a few weeks ( stock image of honey bee shown )			1

@entity25 researcher says bees prefer cities to fields
expansion of farmland has actually been damaging to bee population
wildlife sites in four @entity12 counties saw bee species decrease
reason is likely *due* to wide variety of flowering plants in urban areas
