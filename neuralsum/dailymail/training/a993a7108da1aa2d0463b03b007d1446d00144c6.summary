but the one thrown by millionaire ’s daughter @entity2 did more than just upset the next - door neighbours			1
the all - night bash was so loud it could be heard three miles away			0
it went on until police arrived at 7am on sunday to tell miss @entity2 to turn the music down			1
and after complaints from angry villagers , the 18 - year - old was told by the local council to apologise , although her mother insisted it was ‘ just a few people having a bit of fun ’			1
miss @entity2 organised the extravagant party , which had its own dj and at least 60 guests , to mark the start of her gap year and a friend ’s 18th birthday			1
it was mostly held outdoors at @entity35 , her family ’s stately home			0
but while the secluded @entity39 listed mansion is set in 1,100 acres of @entity8 woodland , the revelry was loud enough to wake residents in three neighbouring villages			2
they said they had never heard such a din coming from the estate , which has been owned by the @entity2 family for 210 years and for the past ten years has been open to the public , hosting upmarket festivals , weddings and concerts			1
@entity52 , who lives a mile away in @entity53 , was one of dozens who used @entity56 and @entity57 to express their disbelief at the level of noise			0
the 49 - year - old sales manager described the party as ‘ very selfish ’ and said people in the villages of @entity65 and @entity66 , almost three miles away , were also disturbed			2
‘ we all enjoy a party and no one objects to it once in a while if we are notified about it and it does n’t go on all night , ’ she said			0
‘ but this was absolutely crazy , the thump - thump - thump of the music went on all night			2
‘ my six - year - old woke up and asked me what the noise was			0
' my niece and her friends who were staying knew all the songs that were being played , it was n’t just a drone of background noise			0
’ mother - of - two @entity86 said she , her daughters and her mother were also kept awake			2
‘ i barely slept until 5.30am , ’ she said			0
‘ i went on @entity56 from around 3.30am and could n’t believe how many other people were awake because of it			0
’ @entity8 and @entity92 said officers gave ‘ strong words of advice ’ when they went to the manor house			1
bosses at @entity8 , who received complaints about the noise , instructed miss @entity2 to apologise in person to villagers			1
the teenager , who is preparing to leave for a nine - month trip to @entity105 , said : ‘ i warned all our neighbours about the party and they all seemed fine with it			2
' we put the speakers in the direction of the valley to minimise the volume			0
’ miss @entity2 , whose 20 - year - old sister @entity114 is away at university , added : ‘ during the course of the night , as everyone became absorbed in the party atmosphere , what started as an acceptable volume level must have crept up			1
‘ i ’ve been back to apologise to some of the farmers and neighbours who were affected by the noise as i did n’t mean to disturb anyone			0
venue : police were called to the home and @entity131 estate near @entity132 , @entity8 , around 4am on sunday following complaints about the noise business : since the early 2000s the @entity135 estate has been opened up to the public to help fund repair work of the aging building			1
the venue hosts weddings , concerts and other events for families in charge : the house has been owned by the @entity2 family for 210 years with @entity148 - @entity147 ( pictured ) taking over in the 1980s ‘ i would like to apologise to local residents for not realising that the volume had reached an unacceptable level and , therefore , for disturbing their sunday morning			1
’ but miss @entity2 ’s mother , @entity153 , 47 – who was aware the party had been planned and was in the house with her husband @entity156 , 51 – while it took place , has defended her daughter ’s party			1
‘ it was just a private party and a few people getting together to have a bit of fun , ’ she said			1

‘ @entity188 ensured that all the neighbours were aware of the party and warned them a few days before – she ’s since been back to apologise to those affected			0
‘ the wind meant that the volume and music travelled a lot further than it would usually have , which is very unfortunate			0
