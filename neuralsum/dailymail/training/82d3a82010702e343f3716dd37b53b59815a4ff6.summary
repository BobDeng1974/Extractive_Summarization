by @entity0 published : 07:49 est , 14 december 2012 updated : 07:49 est , 14 december 2012 a gay couple has sparked outrage for displaying a ' homosexual nativity scene ' in their @entity5 home			2
@entity7 and @entity8 have come under fire for their all - male manger - where the baby @entity12 has two father @entity15 and the @entity16 is nowhere to be seen			1
the country 's @entity17 has labelled the display , in the northern city of @entity21 , as ' sacrilege '			2
' sacrilege ' : this picture posted by a gay couple of the nativity scene with two @entity25 but no @entity16 has sparked a storm of criticism in @entity28 and thousands of @entity5 have taken to social networking sites to slam the pair , with many saying they show ' a lack of respect to @entity34 and all @entity35 '			2
a @entity37 user added : ' as much as i support gay rights , this is just stupid on so many levels			1
if you are a @entity17 you have to accept @entity12 ' parents were @entity16 and @entity44			0
' political analyst @entity7 and entrepreneur @entity8 have been together for four years and were united by a civil union , the closest thing to marriage for homosexuals in @entity5 , three months ago			1
the gay rights activists told the @entity51 website that they set up the scene , a picture of which was then posted on @entity37 , in the hope that it would help in bringing about reform in the country 's gay marriage laws			1
controversy : the gay couple posted a picture of their alternative nativity scene rather than the traditional arrangement of @entity16 , @entity44 and baby jesus ( file picture ) a bill to legalise gay marriage is currently being looked at by the country 's politicians and has passed the first of four debates			1
but it has been dubbed as ' unconstitutional ' by the nation 's conservative lawmakers			0
@entity7 told the website : ' we did it because we believe in @entity5			0
we have lived in different cities in the world and we prefer to return to our country			0
' we are beginning to build [ a better country ] through our new union			0
' earlier this week , the government announced plans to introduce gay marriage in @entity85 and @entity86 in 2015			1
but the move has divided the conservative party and attracted criticism from the @entity90 despite assurances that the police has measures to protect religious freedom .			0
