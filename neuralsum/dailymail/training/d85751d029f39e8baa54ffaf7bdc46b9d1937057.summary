by @entity0 published : 19:40 est , 29 march 2013 updated : 19:40 est , 29 march 2013 named and shamed : @entity2 councillor @entity1 , 35 , lost a legal fight to stay anonymous after she was found drunk in charge of a child an @entity7 - educated @entity2 politician has lost her year - long battle to gag the @entity9 from reporting that she was arrested for being drunk in charge of her toddler			1
@entity13 , 35 , who had previously been cautioned for a similar offence , was hauled in front of magistrates last may to answer for her crime			1
but the former banking lawyer tried to prevent newspapers from identifying her and covering the case by applying for reporting restrictions			1
after magistrates refused to grant the application , she ordered her lawyers to seek an injunction and apply for a judicial review to prevent details of the case ever emerging			1
but the newspapers challenged the injunction in the @entity31 and judges have now ruled against her , arguing that there was an ‘ undeniable legitimate interest ’ in reporting the case			1
@entity1 , who has been a councillor in @entity37 , @entity38 , since 2011 , has now resigned as she felt the ‘ publicity ’ meant she could not continue in her role			2
anti-censorship campaigners last night branded her actions a ‘ classic attempt ’ to abuse the right to privacy and prevent the public knowing the truth about her behaviour			0
the district councillor fought to keep her identity secret for almost a year following her arrest in @entity52 in @entity37 last april			2
the store ’s manager called the police after becoming concerned by @entity1 ’s behaviour while in charge of her two - and - a - half - year - old daughter			1
her blood alcohol level was found to be four times the legal limit for driving a car			0
@entity1 , who was cautioned for a similar offence in august 2011 , was arrested			2
she was later fined £ 100 and ordered to pay £ 85 costs and a victim surcharge of £ 15			0
deep regret : @entity1 said she felt she had let people down , and that she had used alcohol as a crutch to help her deal with post-natal depression and high levels of anxiety during the hearing , @entity1 ’s solicitor , @entity74 - @entity73 , asked magistrates to apply reporting restrictions to the case			1
@entity1 said she was seeking help for mental health issues and alcohol dependency and applied for an order under @entity83 of the @entity84			1
the act is used to prevent the publication of information that might lead to the identification of any children – not adults – who are involved in criminal proceedings			0
no evidence was provided about how the child might be affected by its mother ’s identification , other than that it ought to be protected ‘ from the serious impact of a press release on this matter ’			0
the magistrates refused to grant the order , but @entity1 ’s lawyers served an injunction on the @entity106 and its sister title the @entity9 , preventing any publication of the case			1
they served an interim injunction because @entity1 ’s solicitors were seeking a judicial review over the decision by magistrates not to apply reporting restrictions			1
they argued the child would be identifiable if the newspapers named @entity1 , said she was a councillor without naming her , or said what she was charged with			2
but the newspapers argued that it was in the public interest and in the interests of open justice to publish the details of her offence			0
drunk in charge : the manager of the @entity52 in @entity37 became concerned about @entity1 's condition while she was in the shop and called police who found she was four times over the drink - drive limit judges mr justice @entity134 and @entity135 agreed and dismissed @entity1 ’s judicial review in their @entity31 judgment			1
mr @entity138 said : ‘ the criminal conviction itself , although it attracted a relatively low penalty , was far from trivial			0
‘ to be drunk in charge of a small child of two - and - a - half years of age raises very considerable concerns regarding the general welfare of the child , especially when a caution had been administered not long before for the same offence			1
’ he said the caution – and the risk of public exposure – had failed to deter @entity1 from committing the offence a second time , which ‘ strongly suggested there might be more serious underlying problems ’			2
he added that @entity1 was ‘ an elected councillor , and her conduct in public had twice fallen well below the standard that could reasonably be expected of an elected official by her constituents and by the public generally , who had an undeniable legitimate interest in learning , through media publication , of how [ she ] had behaved ’			2
he said that @entity1 ’s mental health problems and alcohol dependence were also details ‘ which arguably the public were entitled to learn through a press report of proceedings ’			0
@entity173 , spokesman for the @entity175 campaign group , said : ‘ it ’s a classic attempt to abuse the right to privacy to cover up misdemeanours			0
‘ this case is a matter of public interest and involves an elected official			0
’ @entity1 said she had turned to drink to cope with post-natal depression and anxiety			0
she said she had offered to resign at the time but claimed the @entity2 and @entity187 advised her she did not need to as it was a personal matter			0
she added : ‘ i sought legal advice to obtain an injunction to stop any printing of the story purely to protect the privacy of my family and not for any personal reasons			0

but she then applied to the court to restrict reporting of the case
magistrates *disagreed* so she sought judicial review and an injunction
local papers *successfully* fought her lawyers in the high court
