by @entity0 , @entity2 in @entity1 and @entity3 published : 08:53 est , 7 august 2013 updated : 18:37 est , 7 august 2013 president @entity4 has canceled his @entity6 summit with president @entity7 , making his anger at the @entity10 leader clear amid heightened tensions over their decision to allow whistle - blower @entity13 remain in their country			1
the decision , announced on wednesday , reflects both @entity19 anger over their the @entity13 decision and growing frustration within the @entity4 administration over what it sees as @entity6 's stubbornness on other key issues , including missile defense and human rights			1
the night before the meeting was cancelled , president @entity4 also talked about how the @entity10 stance against homosexuals - which will likely become a major issue when they host the winter olympic games - is another addition to the growing list of concerns			1
issue : @entity10 's decision to grant @entity13 ( center ) temporary asylum was part of the reason for the cancellation ‘ @entity10 ’s disappointing decision to grant @entity13 temporary asylum was also a factor that we considered in assessing the current state of our bilateral relationship			1
’ the president 's announcement drew scorn from some @entity76 - not for the decision itself , but for what @entity76 insiders said it reflected about the @entity83 's ability to control @entity19 - @entity10 relations			1
' it is presidential amateur hour , ' @entity86 @entity85 senator @entity85 wrote on @entity89 shortly after the announcement , because ' @entity4 does n't counter @entity7 granting asylum to @entity13			1
' ' the @entity4 " reset " w @entity10 needs a reset , ' he said			2
rep. @entity93 , a @entity76 from @entity94 , said @entity4 is ' figuring out now that appeasement toward potential adversaries does n't work			0
' but @entity98 sen. @entity97 acknowledged that @entity4 ' made [ the ] right call in canceling ' the bilateral summit with @entity7			1
she cited ' @entity10 's actions on [ @entity102 ] @entity13 , @entity103 and human rights issues			1
' @entity4 will still attend the @entity106 economic summit in @entity107 , @entity10 , but a top @entity83 official said the president had no plans to hold one - on - one talks with @entity7 while there			1
instead of visiting @entity7 in @entity6 , the president will add a stop in @entity115 to his early september travel itinerary			2
@entity4 , who is traveling in @entity117 , said that the frosty relationship between the @entity19 and @entity10 has come as a result of their actions , or lack thereof			2
' there have been times where they slip back into @entity127 thinking and a @entity127 mentality , ' @entity4 said in an interview with @entity130 on @entity131			0
‘ i was disappointed because even though we do n’t have an extradition treaty with them , traditionally we have tried to respect if there ’s a law - breaker or an alleged law - breaker in their country , we evaluate it and we try to work with them			0
they did n’t do that with us			0
and in some ways it ’s reflective of some underlying challenges that we ’ve had with @entity10 lately			0
making a statement : president @entity4 said that he was ' disappointed ' with @entity10 and their decisions on a host of issues ‘ a lot of what ’s been going on has n’t been major breaks in the relationship , and they still help us on supplying our troops in @entity158 ; they ’re still helping us on counterterrorism work ; they were helpful after the @entity161 bombing in that investigation			1
and so there ’s still a lot of business that we can do with them			0
’ @entity4 's decision to scrap talks with @entity7 is also likely to deepen the chill in the already cold relationship between the two leaders			2
they have frequently found themselves at odds on pressing international issues , most recently in @entity103 , where the @entity19 accuses @entity7 of helping president @entity176 fund a civil war			2
the @entity19 has also been a vocal critic of @entity10 's crackdown on @entity181 critics and recently sanctioned 18 @entity10 for human rights violations			0
opening up : @entity4 talked to @entity131 host @entity130 about @entity10 and their laws against homosexuals during an appearance on his show on tuesday night @entity6 has accused the @entity19 of installing a missile shield in @entity189 as a deterrent against @entity10 , despite @entity19 assurances that the shield is not aimed at its former @entity127 foe			2
@entity7 also signed a law last year banning @entity19 adoptions of @entity10 children , a move that was seen as retaliation for the @entity19 measure that cleared the way for the human rights sanctions			0
@entity4 and @entity7 last met in june on the sidelines of the @entity203 in @entity41			0
@entity205 senator @entity204 said wednesday that ' @entity7 does n't deserve the respect after what he 's done with @entity13			1
' ' i know what he 's doing			0
he 's trying to make @entity10 a big power again , ' @entity204 said on @entity211			0
' to show him the respect at the bilateral talks does n't make sense			0
