@entity1 manager @entity0 says he would have no problem with sneaking through the ‘ back door ’ into @entity5 football via the @entity6			1
the @entity1 started the season strongly and looked a good bet for @entity5 qualification around @entity10 before their form fell away , with a mid-table finish now all - but certain			0
but a reprieve could be granted by the @entity6 , with @entity0 ’s side topping the @entity16 table for their good behaviour , just ahead of @entity18			2
if @entity1 finish top of the pile and @entity23 ’s top flight is within the top three ‘ fair - playing ’ leagues in @entity25 – which it was on last count - they will earn a @entity29 place			1
@entity0 's @entity1 are top of the @entity31 table , sitting just above @entity18 the @entity1 have won once in their last 10 league matches and drew 1 - 1 against @entity33 in their last match where do the @entity36 teams stand ? 1			1
@entity40 qualification via @entity31 would see the @entity1 enter the competition at the first qualifying round , playing their first game on july 2 and competing in up to six games before the @entity16 season even starts			2
but @entity0 , who takes his charges to face champions @entity39 on sunday , just wants to qualify and does n’t care how he does it , or when the season restarts			1
‘ it ’s a headache but you ’ve got to take the opportunity if it arises , ’ he said			0
‘ it might be seen as the back door , ( but ) it ’s an opportunity to play in @entity25			1
‘ i think every player wants , not come back that bit earlier , but certainly to play in @entity25 because this club has n’t been in that position to play in @entity25 for a long time			2
’ @entity0 ’s @entity60 future hangs in the balance with his contract expiring in the summer and a section of fans demanding he is replaced at the end of the season , but he has already been involved in meetings concerning pre-season plans			1
@entity0 is out of contract at @entity1 in the summer which leaves his managerial future in the balance ‘ the difficulty is the fact that we do n’t know when , yet , whether we ’re going to finish in that spot , ’ he said			1
‘ and so we ’ve already planned for either			0
one in it and one out of it , and obviously if we ’re in it we ’re back earlier , a few days earlier			0
if we ’re out of it ( the @entity29 ) we come back on july 1 , which is one of the smallest close seasons we ’ve had in a long time			2
‘ and even then international players wo n’t be back on that date , either earlier or on the first of july because they wo n’t be finished international duties until the middle of june			0
’ @entity87 ( left ) and @entity88 ( right ) could be playing @entity29 football next season conceding late goals in games to drop points has been a trend for @entity1 of late , topped off by @entity96 ’s 95th - minute equaliser for @entity33 at @entity60 on saturday			1
@entity0 hopes that run of misfortune will end at the @entity99			0
‘ it ’s been a terrible thing for our results in terms of points to performances in general , ’ he said			0
‘ we ’ve got to make sure that we focus and if we ’re in that position again ( leading late on ) , do n’t show the type of nerves we showed last week			0
‘ i think we got exceedingly nervous in the last few minutes and made basic mistakes which kept allowing a bit of pressure and @entity33 took advantage of it			0

@entity0 's @entity1 are top of the @entity118 table
the @entity60 outfit could be playing @entity29 football next year
@entity0 has said he 's happy to sneak through the ‘ back door ’ into @entity25
