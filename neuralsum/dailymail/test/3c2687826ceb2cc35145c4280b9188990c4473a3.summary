the six - month - old foal was in a pitiful state			2
dumped on the side of a busy road outside @entity5 , emaciated and riddled with worms , he was shivering pitifully in the january chill and clinging to life by a thread			2
his rescuers called him @entity11 : a teddy bear name for a teddy bear temperament			2
despite what he has endured , @entity11 is a loving , affectionate soul who likes nothing more than to have the back of his head rubbed			2
to see him today , three months on but still unsteady on his feet , it seems heartless beyond belief that anyone could leave such a vulnerable creature to die			2
sixteen - year - old @entity25 , from @entity26 , @entity27 , is just one of the many people finding that they can no longer keep up with the financial costs of keeping and looking after a horse but , sadly , stories like @entity11 ’s are all too common			1
across the country , horses , ponies and donkeys — many of them once much - loved family pets — are being abandoned in record numbers and left to fend for themselves or tied up on busy roadsides in the hope that someone will rescue them			1
animal welfare charities , meanwhile , are full to capacity , leaving them increasingly helpless in the wake of the hundreds of calls they receive every month about neglected or abandoned horses			1
earlier this month , in desperation , the @entity52 launched an urgent appeal to rehome some of the hundreds of horses in their care			1
their three sanctuaries , with capacity for 640 horses , are full , with 500 other horses being kept at huge expense in private boarding stables while they wait for a place			1
three thousand more , meanwhile , are estimated to be at risk , although the real number could be much higher			0
last year , the @entity52 alone took in 1,500 horses , many of them former family pets			1
little wonder that the word @entity52 workers are using to describe the situation is ‘ crisis ’			1
as @entity76 , centre manager at @entity77 , one of their three animal centres , puts it , trying to provide care for the ever - growing numbers of needy equines is a ‘ constant battle ’			0
‘ the moment we rehome a horse another one steps into its place , ’ she says			1
‘ i have been here for four years and every year the problem has got worse			1
’ @entity90 , 33 , a trainee agricultural assistant from @entity91 , says that since an accident which hurt her back she can no longer ride her horse @entity95 , and as a result ca n't afford to keep him either it ’s hard to argue with the numbers , which all equine welfare organisations say have risen steadily in the recession , and continue to do so , despite the economy improving			1
@entity102 , a horse consultant for campaign group @entity103 , says that many people remain unable to afford the minimum £ 3,000 cost per year to keep a horse — a sum that can soar if there are veterinary bills			1
yet those who bought a horse years ago and are now struggling to afford it , find they have no one to sell to			1
‘ there is no demand or buoyancy in the market compared with seven or eight years ago , ’ says @entity102			0
‘ people might afford a new tv , but they ca n’t commit to the long - term care of an animal			0
’ @entity90 's horse @entity95 ( pictured ) is one of the many family pets who find themselves either being sold on by owners who can no longer afford to keep them , or abandoned by those who fail to find them a new home reluctant to sell their horses to abattoirs , many owners mistakenly believe that leaving them to fend for themselves on a patch of land such as a roadside verge — a common practice known as fly - grazing , which is illegal — is the better option			1
in reality , however , most horses can not survive for long without human care			1
the problem is that more and more owners are taking on horses without preparation			1
mother - of - four @entity146 , from @entity26 , @entity27 , is the first to admit she was naive about horse ownership — and as a result has been left frantically trying to find a home for her 16 - year - old daughter @entity25 ’s @entity152 cob @entity153 , without success			1
‘ none of us realised the financial commitment of owning a horse , ’ says @entity146			1
‘ we did n’t have any land so found him a field and stables which cost £ 80 a month			0
’ then there is @entity153 ’s food and hay , which can cost up to £ 100 a month , and the regular £ 30 charge to keep his hooves trimmed			0
‘ we ’ve at least been lucky that he ’s been healthy , so the vet bills have been low , but vaccinations are still £ 260 a year , ’ she says			1
‘ it began to get more and more of a stretch to care for him			0
’ @entity90 's back pain forced her to give up her beloved horse @entity95 ( pictured together left )			2
' on average , i was paying £ 160 a month to rent a field and a stable			0
it was £ 10 for a bag of feed which lasts two or three days ' the situation reached crisis point last summer — by when @entity146 had taken a part - time cleaning job to help fund @entity153 ’s care , while @entity25 had started work as a trainee hairdresser to help out , too			0
‘ but it still was n’t enough money			0
i thought : “ i ca n’t do this any more ” — i ’ve got four children and there are other priorities , ’ says @entity146			0
‘ it ’s been a difficult decision , but the truth is @entity153 is a luxury we ca n’t afford			0
’ so , earlier this year , the family made the reluctant decision to put him up for sale			1
yet months on , there still have been no takers — though the family is adamant they will not abandon him			2
@entity146 ’s experience chimes with that of @entity90 , 33 , a trainee agricultural assistant from @entity91			0
the mother - of - two has always loved riding her 20 - year - old horse @entity95 , but last year had to stop after being kicked by a cow , leaving her with back pain			1
‘ riding now exacerbates the pain and i simply ca n’t afford to keep a horse that i ca n’t ride , ’ she says			2
‘ on average , i was paying £ 160 a month to rent a field and a stable			0
it was £ 10 for a bag of feed which lasts two or three days			0
’ long - time rider @entity221 , a 54 - year - old self - employed carer from @entity222 , @entity223 , says rocketing costs drove her to give away her beautiful 14 - year - old cob , @entity226 and so , like @entity146 , she had to make the painful decision to get rid of @entity95 , selling him to a family in @entity230			1
the price of hay has risen far beyond inflation , with some farmers putting up a bale by £ 5			0
it is a cost hitting busy animal sanctuaries harder than ever			0
@entity238 , who runs @entity239 in @entity240 , @entity241 , is overseeing 50 abandoned or neglected horses			1
‘ we have had them left tied up outside the sanctuary gates , ’ says @entity238 , 48			0
‘ we ’ve found horses in such a pitiful state that it makes you want to weep			2
’ like the beautiful @entity251 pony , found in a coal shed , skeletally thin , cast aside when she was too old to be ridden			0
‘ she would have been every little girl ’s fantasy in her prime , but once she had outlived her usefulness she ended up in this appalling state , ’ says @entity238			0
’ @entity221 found it so difficult to find a buyer for horse @entity226 , at one point she considered having her put to sleep			2
' the thought broke my heart , but i did n’t know what to do , ’ she says long - time rider @entity221 , a 54 - year - old self - employed carer from @entity222 , @entity223 , says rocketing costs drove her to give away her beautiful 14 - year - old cob , @entity226 , who she could n’t afford alongside her other horse , @entity271			1
at one point last year , she became so overwhelmed that she contemplated having @entity226 put to sleep			2
‘ the thought broke my heart , but i did n’t know what to do , ’ she says			0
in the end , after many frantic phone calls , @entity221 found a local stud farm , who took @entity226 to breed from			0
‘ i was lucky , although it was devastating			0
but a lot of people abandon their horses as they do n’t know what else to do and think it ’s the kinder option			2
’ well - meaning or not , fly - grazing is now heartbreakingly common and many owners do not comply with laws requiring them to microchip their horses , making tracing them impossible			1
so it is left to animal sanctuaries to take in the poor creatures — if they are discovered in time to save them .			0

increasing costs mean few owners can keep up with looking after a horse
with *dwindling* buyers more horses than ever are being abandoned
last year , the @entity52 alone took in 1,500 , many of them family pets
