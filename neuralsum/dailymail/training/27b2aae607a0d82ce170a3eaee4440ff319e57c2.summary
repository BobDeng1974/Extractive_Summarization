a @entity8 @entity2 agent has admitted the controversial technique in statements to court , and claimed it was used in an effort to catch out pedophiles signed up to the service			1
it is understood to be the first time the @entity17 has actually dealt child porn as part of a sting , though agents have posed as child porn dealers in the past			2
child protection advocates are likely to be outraged by the revelation , as federal prosecutors often claim that each time an image of rape or molestation is shared , the child is abused again			1
controversial : the @entity2 ran a child pornography service for two weeks last year , distributing images of children being raped and abused online to around 5,000 customers known only as ' @entity36 , ' the @entity35 - based child pornography service was described in an april 10 search warrant affidavit as an online bulletin board with the primary business of advertising and sharing child pornography			1
the affidavit was obtained by @entity44 earlier this month but has since been sealed , the news website reported			0
the document described how agents in the @entity48 area seized the site on november 16 , 2012 and continued to operate it , while also monitoring graphic and disturbing messages among users , until december 2 , 2012			2
at least 10,000 photos of children being raped , abused or forced to pose naked were broadcast through ' @entity36 , ' according to @entity44			1
it had more than 5,600 registered users and 24,000 posts when it was finally shut down on december 2			0
the @entity2 told @entity59 it could n't discuss the case or its decision to continue operating the website because the investigation was ongoing			1
' this remains an ongoing investigation , and local court rules and @entity68 policy prohibit me from providing more information at this time , ' said @entity72 spokeman @entity71			0
' as in any given matter , if charges are filed , they will eventually become a matter of public record			0
' however , according to @entity44 , court records suggest investigators resorted to running the ring after they were unable to trace customers through the service 's records			2
while no charged have been laid in the case , information garnered from the investigation has reportedly led agents to one western @entity89 home , which was searched on april 10			0
the study found access to porn can lead to young people engaging in ¿ risky behaviours ¿ such as unprotected anal sex and the use of drugs and alcohol during sex the suspect is alleged to have accessed a ' jailbait ' girls section of the website , specifically two men raping a pre-teen girl			2
he has n't yet been charged and it 's unclear what data was uncovered on computers seized from the property			0
the @entity8 agent 's statement reveals users often bragged about images of children being sexually assaulted by multiple men			1
' there have been over 7,850 views of this thread in less than a week , which is a great compliment to the girls ! ' one user wrote , according to @entity44 , which viewed the search warrant			0
' however , i find it hard to believe than ( sic ) in the last century and a half since photography was invented , it has n't occurred to more people that to photograph a cute little girl being hard ( expletive ) by two men is a fine and arousing thing to do			0
' in another thread , users chatted casually about their desire to rape children sown in a series of pornographic images			0
' @entity140 i would enjoy hurting that child , ' a user said in the chat thread , the search warrant affidavit revealed			0

investigators also do not state whether abused children whose pictures were accessed and swapped by pedophiles during the investigation were notified by the @entity2 .			1

a @entity8 @entity2 agent has admitted the *bureau* busted a @entity35 - based child porn website in november , 2012 , and operated it for two weeks before shutting it down
while under @entity2 control , up to 5,600 users swapped and accessed images of children being raped , abused or forced to pose naked
@entity2 agent said , in court documents , the decision to continue operating the site was taken after they *struggled* to identify users from the site 's records
federal prosecutors often claim that each time an image of molestation is shared , the child is abused again
