by @entity0 , @entity1 after returning to competitive action to take two @entity5 medals , @entity2 will go back to the small screen before launching an assault on the @entity9 squad next year			1
the @entity10 have been @entity2 's first since he took a silver and bronze at the @entity13 , with the 25 - year - old enjoying the subsequent fame since			1
he won the popular television show @entity16 and later this year will star in a new gymnastics - based show called tumble as he continues to enjoy his own legacy			1
screen : @entity22 winner @entity2 will return to tv in @entity25 later this year double : @entity2 won @entity5 gold in the team even and bronze in the pommel horse final but a gold for @entity32 in the team event on tuesday and a bronze in thursday 's pommel horse final showed he still has what it takes to live with the best in his day job and he intends to show that in 2015			1
when asked if he will be seen in the sport again , he said : ' i hope so			2
i have a lot more work to be doing to get in the @entity44 squad			0
i am not going to be competing again this year - i have other media commitments with @entity25 and everything			2
' but 2015 will be a year when i can hopefully get back into the @entity9 team			1
i will keep on training			0
' that means @entity2 will not be putting himself up for selection for the @entity51 in @entity52 later this year , although if he is true to his word then the same event in @entity55 in 2015 and the subsequent @entity56 could be on the agenda			1
shiny : @entity2 ( right ) won @entity59 's @entity16 in 2012 with partner @entity60 ( left ) @entity62 joy : @entity2 won a silver and a bronze medal at @entity13 before taking a break from gymnastics his performance on thursday showed he still has enough to mix it with the big names , despite effectively being a part - time competitor			1
he attempted a new and more difficult routine to the one he normally performs which , had it come off , could have earned him a score higher than 14.966			0
as it was , he showed signs of rust and took third , behind compatriot @entity78 in second and popular runaway home winner @entity80			2
' it was nice to medal			0
i was happy i got up there , did a new routine , ' @entity2 added			2
' i was n't as fit at that routine as i could have been			0
i was a lot more stable with my other one			0
i was standing there , just as i was about to do my routine , thinking about whether or not i should do it or not			0
aiming high : @entity2 hopes to make the @entity9 team for gymnastics again in 2015 ' i could have played safe			1
me , @entity94 and @entity78 are in a league of our own , not being big - headed , and i could have done my easier routine and got a medal			2
i wanted to see where i was at , how my mind was , and i kind of almost did it			0
' it 's just brilliant , nice to test it out , see where i am , i had great fun			0
' tumble - which features other big sporting names such as @entity105 - will now occupy his mind , but he intends to keep training and keep pushing the boundaries of his skill set in order to have a tilt at future glory			1
' i think i have proved i have got a lot more in the tank , ' he said			0
' i have a bit more fitness to work on but i am excited , 2015 is going to be a big year			2
from what i have got in my head , i know what routines i need to do , i 'm doing a few more apparatus now and hopefully i can break back into the @entity44 squad			0
