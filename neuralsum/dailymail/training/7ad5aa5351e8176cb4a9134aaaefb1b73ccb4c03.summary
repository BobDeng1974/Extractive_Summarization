@entity1 's uncertainty about a 2016 presidential run has some republicans questioning whether he 's prepared to take on the challenge @entity6 @entity1 's flirtation with a possible run for the @entity8 in 2016 has been so low key that some in his party are n't convinced he 's prepared to take on the challenge			1
the former @entity14 governor with the famous family name is among the leaders in polls charting potential @entity6 contenders in 2016 and says he will decide late this year or early next year			2
but unlike some would - be competitors like @entity21 governor @entity20 , who are making forward - leaning statements , @entity1 is publicly expressing his uncertainty			1
questions are weighing heavily on @entity1 , 61 , about the impact on his wife and family and whether he can offer an agenda that would unite @entity29			1
whether he will run is a question that comes up almost daily for @entity1 as he travels the country campaigning for @entity6 candidates ahead of nov. 4 congressional elections			1
on thursday , he was in @entity34 , @entity35 , campaigning with governor @entity36 , who is seeking re-election			0
' it 's a big decision , ' he told reporters in @entity34			0
' it relates to family			0
' ' i think the next presidential race has to be about the future and it has to be about fixing some big problems , ' he said			0
' i think it 's more than likely that he 's giving this a serious thought and moving forward , ' @entity1 's son , @entity47 , said on @entity53 's ' @entity52 ' program on sunday			1
' the family will be behind him 100 percent if he decides to do it			0
' he said that his father is ' still assessing ' a presidential bid but it is ' more than likely that he 'll run			2
' @entity1 's decision - making seems far less advanced than the past @entity1 presidents were at similar points in their own career , leading some republicans to raise questions			1
his father , former president @entity65 , began preparing for a 1988 run in 1985			1
his brother , former president @entity67 , was actively planning his 2000 run at this point in 1998			1
' there 's a scent of activity that goes on in preparation for a serious candidacy that involves a lot of contacts with donors and strategists , ' said @entity14 @entity79 strategist @entity79			0
' people are n't seeing that from @entity1			2
i will say he 's been more active , been talking to folks , but not to a degree that @entity20 has been doing			0
' @entity65 and @entity67 : unlike his father and brother , who eagerly planned their run for the @entity8 , @entity1 is still undecided about whether he will run for president in 2016 friends say @entity1 's cautiousness is due to his deliberate manner and his experience watching his father and brother go through what can be a meat - grinding process			1
they also say he is not expecting to be drafted , recruited or convinced to run			0
that is not his style			0
' this is not a guy who spends sleepless nights staring at the ceiling wondering if he should or should not run for president , ' said @entity103 , a @entity6 strategist and a friend of @entity1			1
' he 's a disciplined guy and will make this decision like he does most other big decisions , through a serious deliberative process weighing the pros and cons and looking deep into himself			0
this is a decision that will be made by @entity1 , his wife and kids , ' she said			1
if he runs , @entity1 would be injecting himself into the presidential race in a @entity6 that has moved to the right since he left the governor 's office in 2006			2
more than likely : @entity1 's son @entity47 said it is more than likely that his father will run in the 2016 presidential election @entity1 , whose wife of 40 years , @entity124 , was born in @entity125 , has a more welcoming view on immigration than many party conservatives , who criticize his support for comprehensive reform that would allow a path to legal status for undocumented immigrants			1
if @entity1 were to win the @entity6 primary and become the party 's presidential nominee , he would have to convince a majority of @entity29 that it would be worthwhile to have a third president named @entity1 in the @entity139			2
worthwhile : if @entity1 were to win the @entity6 primary and become theparty 's presidential nominee , he would have to convince amajority of @entity29 that it would be worthwhile to have athird president named @entity1 in the @entity139 traits : @entity1 's uncertainty is concerning to some republicans who say they are n't seeing traits of former @entity1 presidents in @entity1 should he run , donors say @entity1 could get up to speed quickly by tapping a ready network of financial supporters built from his own alliances and from those who supported previous @entity1 presidential bids			1
his father and brother have publicly urged him to run			2
people who know them say they are unsure of @entity1 's plans			0
' @entity1 is keeping very close counsel on what his future plans are , ' said @entity163 , spokesman for the elder @entity1			0
' i do n't think he 's ready to make a decision			0
i think he 's being very sincere when he says he will wait until after the election to decide			0

unlike his father and brother , who eagerly planned their run for the @entity8 , @entity1 is still undecided about whether he will run for president in 2016
@entity47 said it is ' more than likely ' that his father will run
@entity1 said the decision is one relating to family to be made by himself , his wife , and children
