two sisters handed a £ 110,000 windfall after their father 's death have been forced to pay it all back and more - after an insurance company sent them the wrong man 's money			1
@entity8 and @entity9 were delighted when the six - figure cheque arrived after a five - year battle to track down the missing pension of their father @entity13			1
they immediately split £ 40,000 between his four grandchildren - as former grave - digger mr @entity13 had wanted - and spent around £ 20,000 more			1
mistake : @entity8 ( r ) and @entity9 ( @entity18 ) , were handed more than £ 100,000 as a pension fund owed to their late father , @entity13 ( centre ) - but the payment was meant for someone else with the same name the sisters had spent years in vain trying to get the pension for their father after he retired at the age of 65 in 2008			1
they had still not managed to track it down by the time he died three years later but vowed to continue looking for it in his memory			2
so they were overjoyed when @entity36 sent the cheque to their solicitors in october 2013			2
but within a month their joy turned to horror when @entity36 announced they had given them the pension belonging to another customer with the same name			2
ordeal : after spending much of the sum , the sisters were horrified to learn of the mistake and struggled to repay the total			2
they were recently forced to pay @entity36 £ 7,000 on top of the full amount paid back two months later the pensions and insurance firm threatened the sisters with legal action unless they handed it all back			1
the devastated pair were forced to sell their father 's house - which they planned to keep as an investment - to repay the money they had spent			1
they also had to borrow from friends and other relatives to make up the full amount of £ 108,895 and paid it all back within a year , by last october			2
but @entity36 took them to court earlier this month and obtained an order to get even more from them - £ 6,000 in costs plus £ 1,000 in interest			1
sad sacrifice : the sisters were forced to sell their father 's house ( pictured ) - which they planned to keep as an investment - to repay the money they had spent the company admitted making an error but said they were forced to launch legal action because the executors told them the money had been distributed and would not be repaid and the parties could not settle the matter amicably			1
mother - of - two ms @entity9 , 45 , a teaching assistant from @entity90 , @entity91 , said : ' it has just caused us untold issues and heartache			2
september 2008 : @entity8 and @entity9 's father , @entity13 , retires from grave - digging and the sisters attempt to track his pension fund			1
2011 : @entity13 dies and ms @entity8 and ms @entity9 have still not been able to obtain money they believe is owed to their father as part of a pension plan			1
october 2013 : the sisters are overjoyed when a letter arrives from @entity36 informing them that they are owed £ 108,000 in their father 's name			1
october 2013 : the sisters immediately distribute £ 40,000 between mr @entity13 's four grandchildren , as he had wished , and spend around £ 20,000 themselves			1
november 2013 : @entity36 contact ms @entity8 and ms @entity9 to inform them that a mistake was made and that a different customer of the same name was actually owed the £ 108,000			1
they are ordered to repay the money			0
october 2014 : after desperately borrowing money from friends and relatives and selling their late father 's house , they manage to pay the sum back to @entity36			1
january 2015 : the sisters are taken to court and ordered to pay @entity36 £ 6,000 in costs and £ 1,000 interest			1
' it has been horrendous and caused arguments within the family			0
' she added : ' we got quoted a point of law which says that no one should gain from a mistake , which we accept , but surely no one should have to pay for one either			0
' we feel like @entity138 just did not want to listen to us			0
we did our best to get back the money as quickly as possible but it takes time			0
' it feels as if they did not believe that we were trying our best to sort it out , it was extremely stressful and some people have stopped talking to us			0
' ms @entity8 , 48 , who also has two children , from @entity146 , @entity147 , said : ' we do n't care about the money , it 's about the injustice			1
' after three years of looking for dad 's pension , we finally thought we had found it - although it was too late for him to enjoy			1
' we thought it was all behind us but then we got the letter and it was like a bad dream			0
we just could not believe what we were reading			0
' @entity138 said : ' in october 2013 a significant overpayment was made to the executors of mr @entity13 's estate on a claim			0
' this was a result of human error			0
' in november 2013 , having established that this error had occurred , we contacted the executors ' solicitors to explain the situation , offer our apologies for the distress caused by the mistake , and to request repayment of the money that had been paid out through our error			2
' we understand that requesting repayment of such a significant sum of money at a difficult time may have been upsetting for the family and we sincerely apologise for any distress caused			2
' given that the error had been discovered within a month and that the estate in question appeared to be of significant value , it was hoped that the matter could be rectified with the minimum inconvenience and distress			0
windfall : a letter dates october 2013 informs the sisters that they are owed more than £ 100,000 as part of an insurance policy ' in response to our request for repayment of the money that had been paid out by mistake , the executors advised that the estate had already been distributed , and that accordingly the money would not be repaid			1
' as per our standard procedures , we instructed our solicitors to take up the case on our behalf			0
' having failed to negotiate a settlement , we commenced legal proceedings , as a last resort			0
' the main proceedings were concluded when the executors paid the full sum claimed			0
' in january 2015 the court ordered that the executors make a further payment to cover a portion of the costs we incurred			0
' one month later : another letter from @entity36 breaks the news to them that an administrative error was made and that they must pay back the full amount they added : ' we offer our unreserved apologies for the initial overpayment error and the subsequent distress this caused			2
' it is regrettable that we were not able to resolve the situation amicably			0
' given the substantial nature of the overpayment , seeking repayment of the funds as per standard industry practice was necessary			0
' we appreciate that financial matters of this nature require sensitive handling , which is why we only ever take legal action as a last resort			0
