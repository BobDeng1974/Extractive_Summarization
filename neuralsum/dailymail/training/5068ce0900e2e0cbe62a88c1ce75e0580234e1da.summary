at first glance , it appears to be some kind of serial killer 's preferred dumping ground			0
but corpses left strewn across isolated woodland in the hills of @entity8 have been put there on purpose to help forensics experts better understand decomposition			1
nicknamed the ' body farm ' , the research laboratory in @entity13 provides a unique opportunity for @entity17 teams to replicate murder scenes in the most realistic setting possible			1
' we help law enforcement figure out what happened to somebody , ' said dr @entity53 , of the @entity33 â€™s @entity54			1
' you can not simulate this kind of work '			0
the bodies are placed in a variety of areas to mimic crime scenes			1
some are buried in shallow graves , inside vehicles or even in a noose , and then left to rot while being monitored for decay			0
the researchers then let nature takes its course , gathering vital clues from insects , the decaying bones and odours			0
the facility , which has been regularly visited by police , prosecutors and coroners since the 1980s , is also used to help identify plane crash victims and those buried in mass war graves			2
' you can not simulate this kind of work ' : dr @entity53 , of the @entity33 's @entity54 , points to an artificial knee on a leg bone @entity17 burial ground : at any one time , there are between 150 and 190 bodies littered among the foliage , all donated by individuals hoping to bring killers to justice from beyond the grave @entity53 told @entity94 : ' we can help provide these answers			1
it may not be the answers they want to hear , but it does provide closure in some ways			0
' a similar facility is due to open in @entity103 in early 2013 to provide the first high - altitude body farm in a desert environment to teach forensic science students at @entity107			1
investigators hope it may solve cases like the murder of @entity114 , a @entity109 teen found four years after she was reported missing with markings on her bones that revealed she was probably stabbed			2
@entity53 said : ' it 's maybe not questions , the scientific questions , people have on their mind all of the time , but when it matters , it 's important to have that science there			0
' macabre : the bodies are left to decompose or even placed in a noose to simulate crimes that investigators are trying to solve heavily guarded : the facility has been visited by police , coroners and prosecutors since the 1980s			2

site in @entity13 , @entity33 , allows *csi* teams to replicate murder scenes
up to 190 remains are littered through the woodland hills at any one time
bodies donated by individuals hoping to snare killers from beyond grave
a similar high - altitude facility is set to open in @entity103 desert next year
