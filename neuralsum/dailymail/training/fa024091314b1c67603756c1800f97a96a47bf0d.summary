the 39 - tonne maintenance wagon ran for 16miles over four miles on the busy @entity11 , while ahead of it a packed commuter train tried to accelerate out of its path – the driver skipping stations and ordering terrified passengers to move into the front carriages			1
the 66 - foot long wagon careered through seven stations on the @entity21 as control staff watched it slowly accelerating towards the centre of the capital			2
one tube worker at the time said the two trains had come ‘ bloody close ’ while a report claimed they were just 40 seconds from a major disaster			2
concern : commuters waiting during the busy rush hour period at @entity32 look on in bemusement as the out of control train hurtles past them awful : a court heard yesterday how the runaway train came within 2,000ft of causing a ' terrible tragedy ' after tearing along four miles of track the @entity71 heard this week how two maintenance workers leapt from the wagon near @entity75 station , @entity9 , after it broke free from a train towing it at 6.30am on august 13 , 2010			1
three @entity21 companies were in the dock for health and safety breaches			0
video footage which emerged after the case shows one of the workers running down the platform alongside the train before he places his hands on his head in despair			0
ahead of it , a train was collecting passengers at @entity32 and control room staff told the driver to close his doors , accelerate away and not stop at stations			1
he told passengers to move to the front of the train			0
runaway train : the 66ft - long maintenance unit that ran out of control for 16 minutes in august 2011 incident : a busy commuter train in front of the runaway was collecting passengers at @entity32 ( pictured ) in north @entity9 and control room staff told the driver to close his doors and urgently accelerate away frightening : this image from the underground control room shows how close the out of control train came to a passenger train which had left @entity115 station shortly after the incident , passenger @entity116 , who had boarded at @entity32 , said : ‘ as soon as we pulled away the driver came on the tannoy and said “ there is an emergency , will everyone move towards the front of the train ”			1
in court : @entity21 has been fined over the incident along with two of its contractors ‘ there was a ripple of panic			1
i went from half asleep to a big adrenaline rush			0
we knew the situation was dangerous because we were going fast			0
' even by the driver ’s voice , we could tell it was serious			0
’ other video footage shows bemused commuters waiting on a packed platform at @entity32 as the wagon rumbles past them at speed , bearing down on the train that has just departed			1
attempts were made to derail the runaway unit by switching the points against it at @entity152 and @entity154 stations , but the measure had no effect			0
the two trains came within 2,000ft of each other before the passenger train was diverted on to the line ’s @entity160 , with the runaway wagon continuing on the @entity164 branch , finally coming to rest when it reached an upward slope near @entity168 station			2
@entity169 , prosecuting for the @entity170 , said there could have been a ‘ terrible tragedy ’ had it not been for the ‘ prompt and skilful actions ’ of control room staff			0
the court was told a coupler which had been attached to the broken - down track maintenance wagon broke , allowing it to slip away from the train pulling it			2
two workers on the wagon jumped clear , realising that , without any power , the brakes on it would not work			0
judge @entity185 said the 16 minutes the train was out of control must have ‘ seemed like an extremely frightening eternity ’ to those involved			1
‘ staff and passengers were put at high risk of injury or death			0
’ @entity21 , maintenance provider @entity196 and the @entity198 operator of the unit @entity195 admitted health and safety breaches			1
