by @entity0 last updated at 5:03 pm on 14th december 2011 slimming is always easier if you have a dieting partner			2
so how lucky for bride @entity6 that her husband , @entity4 , also wanted to lose weight before their wedding			1
and they are clearly both great motivators			2
the pair lost nearly 20 stone between them ahead of their big day - with @entity6 leading the way			1
the bride - to - be , 25 , lost half her body weight - going from 24 stone to 12 - after falling for @entity4 , 27 , two years ago			1
before and after : @entity6 and @entity4 before they started dieting ( left ) and on their wedding day after shedding the pounds , the telesales manager from @entity24 , @entity25 was finally able to fit into the wedding dress she had always dreamed of			1
and with supportive @entity6 's encouragement , 23 - stone builder @entity4 lost more than seven stone , reaching 15.5 stone for the ceremony in november			1
@entity6 said : ' our wedding was the best day of my life			1
i felt beautiful and looked like a completely different person			2
' it was very emotional for my family , seeing me like that			2
they love me for who i am on the inside and so does @entity4 , but they knew how much i wanted to be slim , so it was special for them too			1
' the day was magical			2
we married at a beautiful church in an intimate ceremony , and then flew off on honeymoon to @entity50			2
for the first time in years i was n't ashamed to go to the beach			2
' @entity6 said before she met @entity4 she had no confidence and was always the butt of jokes about her weight			1
she said : ' when i went into pubs with my friends i was used to hearing people say " look at the size of her ! " i pretended i did n't hear it but i was so unhappy			2
i was 23 and hated the way i looked			0
' i hated my clothes and thought i looked awful - i did n't have a social life			0
i was always first to leave the party because i felt uncomfortable			0
@entity6 said : ' our wedding was the best day of my life			1
i felt beautiful and looked like a completely different person ' ' i ate the wrong things			0
i could eat four packets of crisps and a whole packet of biscuits in one day			0
i never ate fruit and vegetables - i preferred to eat takeaways and kebabs four or five times a week			0
' but when i walked down the aisle on my wedding day , people were saying how beautiful i looked			1
' @entity6 used to consume thousands of calories per day eating burgers and pizzas every night			0
she skipped breakfast in the morning preferring to snack on crisps and chocolate from the vending machines at work during the day			0
for lunch @entity6 would buy an unhealthy sandwich or burger from a shop , then for dinner gorge on chicken nuggets and pizza			0
each meal would be washed down with litres of fizzy drinks			0
but fearing she would be alone forever , @entity6 vowed to turn her life around			0
' i hated the way i looked ' : @entity6 on holiday in @entity106 when she weighed more than 20 stone after joining the @entity109 slimming programme she lost four stone before starting internet dating			1
@entity6 said : ' @entity4 was the first person i contacted on the site			1
' we spoke on the phone and emailed but when the time came to meet i was so nervous			0
i weighed 20 stone and even though he was large as well i was worried he would take one look at me and run a mile			1
' we went to a restaurant and i ordered the healthiest thing on the menu - even though i hated it			0
' after finding love the pair encouraged eat other to lose weight and start regular exercise			0
now @entity6 says she feels like a different person and enjoys cooking healthy food for her and her husband			0
weighed down : @entity6 weighed 24 stone when she was 18 , and @entity4 has lost more than seven stone since this picture was taken in 2008 ( right ) she said : ' now i love going out - i actually feel like i 've never done it before because it 's so different as a slim person			1
' for breakfast @entity6 now eats two scrambled eggs and a banana , lunch is grilled chicken or fish with salad and for dinner she enjoys roast vegetables with grilled meat			0
she said : ' i was determined to get into the kind of dress i always wanted to wear to my wedding			2
' when i met @entity4 i was a dress size 26 , but by the time we came to get married i was wearing a size 14 dress			1
' @entity4 has always been a yo - yo dieter , but now he eats healthily like me , although he will eat more of what we make			1
we encourage eat other to live a healthier lifestyle and we go swimming and to the gym together			0
' @entity4 is hilarious , he 's the soppiest man i 've ever met and he 's also my best friend			1
when he proposed in june 2010 he told me he loved me and wanted to spend of his life with me			0
' @entity4 added : ' i feel so lucky to have met @entity6			1
we 're perfect for each other and she keeps me looking my best			0
