campaign : @entity1 , of mothers at @entity5 group , said any recognition of the cost that families bear would be welcome a ‘ silent army ’ of stay - at - home parents and people who care for relatives should be offered tax breaks to match those for working couples , say senior @entity15			1
a group of centre - ground mps will use next week ’s party conference to put pressure on chancellor @entity20 to boost tax breaks for marriage and extend them to carers			1
they will complain about the ‘ discrepancy ’ between generous support for working couples with children and that for families where one parent stays at home			2
the mps include former cabinet minister @entity34 , @entity35 , a member of the no 10 policy board , @entity38 and @entity39			1
from autumn 2015 , the @entity40 has committed to introducing ‘ tax - free childcare ’ for dual earner couples , worth up to £ 2,000 per child			1
such families will be able to open online accounts , run by @entity46 , and @entity47			0
any money paid in will attract a subsidy from the government and the accounts can then be used to pay any registered childcarer			0
the subsidy will be worth up to 20 per cent of childcare bills for families earning up to £ 300,000 where both are in jobs			0
but some conservative mps say it is unfair that the tax breaks will not be available to couples in which only one parent earns			1
the chancellor is introducing a marriage tax allowance from next april designed to help one - earner couples , but it will be worth only around £ 200 a year			1
it will only apply to people paying the basic rate of tax , meaning families with incomes above around £ 42,000 a year will not be helped			2
@entity1 , of campaign group @entity71 , said : ‘ we would welcome any recognition of the cost that families bear when they care for their children themselves and choose not to outsource those costs			2
' at the moment , the system is very much skewed in favour of compensating for those with external childcare costs			0
’ the @entity33 will also call for more generous respite care payments to ease the burden on people looking after friends and relatives			0
the group of mps , which includes minister @entity34 , will use next week ’s party conference to put pressure on chancellor @entity20 ( above ) to boost tax breaks for marriage and extend them to carers they back tax breaks for what they call ‘ unsung heroes ’ of social care , saying that where carers work part - time they should be able to reduce their tax bills in return			1
the @entity33 ’ report will point out that the value of informal care carried out by family members and friends is estimated at £ 119billion a year			0
some 6.5million people in the @entity110 are caring unpaid for an ill , frail or disabled family member or friend , and the number providing unpaid care of 50 or more hours per week has increased by 26 per cent over the past decade			0
mr @entity38 said : ‘ we have a silent army of informal carers … motivated solely by commitment to their family members or friends			2
' the difficulty lies with families who want to care for their own relatives , but whose financial situation prevents it			0
‘ the maximum they can claim presently is £ 60 through the carers ’ allowance … they can not set the financial value of their care against their own tax bills or those of their spouse			1
‘ they may then have to put their relatives in a full - time nursing home , at a cost of up to £ 60,000 a year to the state			1
’ he added : ‘ this is not about expensive state hand - outs , but recognising and supporting these unsung heroes who provide care because of their selfless commitment to their families			2
’ mrs @entity39 said the government ‘ needs to go further to help those taking responsibility for the care of their families ’			1
the report will also voice concern over rising levels of personal debt , which has trebled since 1993 , reaching £ 158billion in 2013			0
the mps recommend strengthening affordability tests for lenders , and a cap on the total amount repaid on a loan			0
@entity163 has suggested that a majority @entity165 government would go further than a marriage tax break , calling it ‘ very much a first step ’ .			0
