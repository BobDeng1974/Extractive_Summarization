a captain kirk action figure , @entity1 toys and part of a @entity3 are to be sent into orbit around the @entity6 as the ‘ crew ’ of the first test flight of @entity11 ’s next generation @entity10 space capsule			1
the spacecraft will also carry a sample of soil from the @entity15 , an oxygen hose from an @entity18 mission spacesuit and a series of @entity21 puppets and props			0
they are all part of a weird collection of artefacts and memorabilia that will be sent into space as cargo aboard the first test flight of the @entity10 spacecraft			1
weather conditions for @entity10 ’s launch on thursday from the @entity40 @entity53 , scheduled for 07.05 est ( 12.05 gmt ) , are looking favourable			0
@entity10 is @entity11 's first manned space capsule since the @entity18 module and will allow the @entity56 to regain its capability to launch astronauts into space , which it lost after the retirement of the shuttle			1
the @entity63 is designed to expose the capsule to the conditions it will experience when returning from deep space missions to asteroids and @entity50			1
upon reentry it will reach speeds of up to 20,000 mph and its heat shield will have to bear the brunt of the scorching plasma that builds up as the spacecraft dives through the atmosphere			2
temperatures can reach up to 3,300 degrees c before it slows down enough to deploy its parachutes before dropping into the sea			0
astronauts in @entity10 will also travel through areas of space where intense radiation can be encountered and the capsule will need to protect them from this			1
the test flight will send @entity10 through the inner @entity90 belt , a deadly zone of radiation trapped by the @entity6 's magnetic field			1
radiation experiments onboard the test flights will measure how electronics and astronauts might survive in this hostile environment if they are inside the capsule			1
yet despite the crucial nature of the test flight , @entity11 has packed many of the lockers inside with toys and memorabilia , including a toy figure supplied by @entity106 and a fossil from a @entity3			2
the spacecraft , and its cargo , will be carried into orbit on a @entity111 , taking it 3,600 miles above there @entity6 , about 15 times higher than the @entity113			1
during the four and a half hour flight the capsule will orbit the @entity6 twice before beginning its violent descent back into the atmosphere as scientists attempt to test its heat shields			1
reaching speeds of up to 20,000 mph , the 16 feet wide heat shield will have to withstand temperatures of more than 3,300 degrees @entity124 )			0
a suite of more than 1,200 sensors onboard the capsule will record the stresses , vibrations , temperatures , radiation exposure and acceleration it is exposed to during the descent			0
if it survives reentry , @entity10 will deploy parachutes before splashing down in the @entity136 , where it will be recovered by the @entity137			1
' @entity10 is the exploration spacecraft for @entity11 , and paired with the @entity139 , or @entity139 , rocket it will allow us to explore the solar system , ' said @entity143 , program manager of @entity10 , which is based at @entity144 in @entity145			2
' really , we 're going to test the riskiest parts of the mission - ascent , entry and things like fairing separations , @entity151 jettison , the parachutes plus the navigation and guidance			0
' plus we ’ll fly into deep space and test the radiation effects on those systems			2
' technicians pack bags to be placed into @entity10 's stowage lockers with items from @entity21 including a cookie belonging to @entity162 , @entity164 's rubber duck , @entity166 's cape and slimey the worm a captain @entity169 figurine and @entity1 collectables are among the cargo to be carried on the 3,600 mile test flight of the @entity10 space capsule as @entity11 tests its heat shields ability to withstand the intense heat of re-entry @entity10 will travel twice around the @entity6 before reentering the @entity6 's atmosphere and splashing down in the @entity136 as engineers attempt to test how the capsule will hold up against the violent descent although it will not carry any astronauts on the test flight , the capsule is designed to transport humans , so engineers want to find out what the conditions inside the cabin will be like			1
officials at @entity11 have , however , also decided to continue the tradition of taking mementos into space			0
while @entity195 will carry important radiation experiments , the other lockers have been stuffed with a strange assortment of toys , memorabilia and signed celebrity photos			1
among the cargo will be props from @entity21 including a cookie belonging to @entity162 , @entity164 ’s rubber duck , @entity206 ’s pet @entity207 and @entity166 ’s cape			0
when they return to @entity6 they will take prized spots on the long - running television programme in a bid to educate millions of children about space			2
@entity216 , the main contractor for constructing @entity10 , also worked with the @entity218 to collect items from science fiction - related celebrities to fly onboard			0
@entity106 , who played @entity169 in the original @entity223 series and is a noted space enthusiast , supplied an action figure of ‘ @entity169 in @entity226 ’			0
the @entity10 capsule , seen here inside its launch abort system and service module outside the @entity231 in @entity232 , has been fitted sensors to measure the temperature , vibrations acceleration and radiation that astronauts might be exposed to inside during reentry from a mission to an asteroid or @entity50 reentry is one of the most dangerous parts of human space flight as temperatures can reach up to 3,300 degrees c as plasma builds up on the heat shield of @entity10 , seen here in an artists impression of the capsule as it lines up to being its race through the @entity6 's atmosphere at speeds of up to 20,000 miles per hour ‘ @entity106 is thrilled to send @entity169 back to space and support @entity10 , while inspiring future generations about space travel , " @entity218 vice president @entity257 told @entity258			1
director @entity259 offered an @entity1 challenge coin while back to the future actress @entity261 provided signed cast photos and a delorean time machine model			0
@entity264 , from @entity265 , also gave pictures of her ancestors			0
a collection of pins , medals and artworks will also be carried in the @entity10 lockers			0
recordings of @entity50 from @entity275 's @entity274 , performed by the @entity276 , and ' we shall overcome ' by @entity278 , will also be onboard			0
@entity11 has also placed a tiny sample of lunar soil along with a fossil from a @entity3 donated by the @entity282 , into the capsule			2
. a microchip carrying the names of more than a million people who submitted their names will also be carried onboard			0
in a statement on its website , @entity11 said : ‘ together , the artifacts chart humanity 's progress and technological advancement as the nation takes a critical step forward on the journey to @entity50			2
’ carrying commemorative cargo into space , however , is not a new tradition and has been done since the very early age of space flight			0
@entity11 's @entity303 astronauts carried dimes in their spacesuits while astronauts on the @entity18 missions carried photos and specially stamped envelopes			1
the voyager spacecraft have also carried gold discs featuring sounds of @entity6 along with a range of other information while the @entity315 on @entity50 carried a penny to calibrate its instruments			2
a microchip carrying the names of a million people will also be flown aboard @entity10 on the test flight after the public were given opportunity to have their names included as part of @entity11 's journey to @entity50			1

@entity11 's next - generation spacecraft to be launched 3,600 miles into space
@entity10 will orbit the @entity6 twice before *plummeting* into the @entity136
@entity331 will carry action figures , fossils , lunar dust and celebrity photos
engineers hope to test the radiation and heat inside the capsule on reentry
space capsule is designed to carry astronauts to asteroids and @entity50
