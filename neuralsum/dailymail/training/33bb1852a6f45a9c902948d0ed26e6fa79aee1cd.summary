by @entity0 published : 10:57 est , 24 june 2013 updated : 11:05 est , 24 june 2013 her commitment to her son 's career is legendary			1
she gave him his first tennis racket when he was just two and coached him until he was 11			2
she even sacrificed her marriage to follow him around the world			0
and as she returns to the @entity12 to watch every one of @entity14 's matches , it appears that the world number two 's mother has better things to do than worry about dying her hair			1
@entity20 do : @entity14 's mother @entity21 sported a grey hair do today as she arrived at day one of @entity24 2013 to support her son 53 - year - old @entity26 showcased a new grey hair do at @entity24 today , prompting many to question whether eight years of supporting her son courtside is starting to take its toll			1
speaking ahead of his match today , @entity21 said : ' he 's been playing in @entity24 since 2005 , i think he missed just one year through injury , and you have your own way of dealing with it			1
' i 've done it many times but it does n't get any less stressful			0
' the former @entity43 tennis coach usually sports a bobbed brunette or sandy blonde hairstyle , but it seems she has hung up her the hair dye and opted to age more naturally			1
fifty shades of grey : @entity21 has seemingly ditched the hair dye and has opted to age gracefully with her stylish grey style of late @entity21 famously loves mothering @entity14 , once even rushing out to buy thermometers to check his bathwater was exactly 37 degrees , as prescribed by his physio			1
once , when he did n't have the right shoes for a big match in @entity58 , she flew out from @entity43 with a new pair			0
' what else could i do ? ' she said			0
sadly , her commitment took its toll on her relationship with husband @entity64 - the pair split when @entity14 was just nine			1
at the time , she said : ' i was away a lot and then you 're coaching until quite late in the evening			0
your domestic life gets hit for six			0
' @entity67 : just six months ago @entity21 was sporting a brunette style as she watched @entity14 play in the @entity69 in june 2005 , during @entity14 's @entity24 debut , she was nicknamed ' @entity71 ' after using a video camera to film @entity14 's opponent @entity73 for him to analyse			1
as well as supporting @entity14 from the stands as he bids to become the first @entity43 champion since @entity76 in 1936 , @entity21 will be spending time with her son at his home in @entity79 during the tournament			1
she said : ' the grass court season is the time when he can actually stay at home			0
' he lives about half an hour away from @entity24 - so he has that luxury of being able to stay at home			1
bottle blonde : @entity21 , who will be spending time with her son at his home in @entity79 during the tournament , was sporting a blonde style this time last year ' it is nice to be able to spend a bit of family time and be hi his own surroundings with his girlfriend and his dogs			1
' if @entity14 gets through the early stages of the tournament , the 26 - year - old could come up against top seeds @entity100 , two - time winner @entity102 or defending champion @entity103			1
however , @entity21 would not be drawn on her son 's chances at @entity24			1
she said : ' you never look further than the first round			0
' there 's always an advantage when you 've played somebody recently , in terms of working out your game plan and tactics , particularly when it 's on the same surface			2
' redhead : @entity21 , who watches her sons every match and says it does n't get any easier , has also sported red hues in the past ( pictured here in 2010 and 2009 with @entity14 's girlfriend @entity122 ) the people of @entity14 's home town are fiercely proud of their local hero - packing @entity126 's pubs , hotels and tennis club to cheer him on			1
@entity21 , from @entity130 near @entity131 , says her son draws strength from this backing			1
she said : ' he always has incredible support from the local communities			0
they really push the boat out at this time of year			0
' @entity21 attended the @entity139 in @entity140 this weekend to showcase her @entity142 initiative , which aims to get children active			2
the programme centres on homemade games she played with her sons when they were growing up			0
she explained : ' they 're all games we made up when @entity148 and @entity14 were small			2
support system : @entity21 is her son 's number one fan and has supported him since day one			1
here , she is pictured at his first ever wimbledon tennis championships in june 2005 ' i had two boisterous young boys at home and not much money , so we were always challenging ourselves to find things that we could do when the weather 's bad , often it was things we could do inside , without spending a lot of money			2
' biscuit tin lid cereal boxes , for example			0
we played that with cereal boxes for the net , biscuit lids for bats and a ping pong ball			0
' it 's all simple stuff and you do n't need to go out and spend any money or book a pitch to do it			2
' it was these activities that contributed to @entity14 and @entity148 's success on the court , according to @entity21			1
' i believe that doing so many fun activities when the kids were small helped to develop good hand - eye coordination			0
' @entity14 , as well as being a really good tennis player , was also an extremely good football player			2
doting : @entity21 famously loves mothering @entity14 and even used to rush out to buy thermometers to check his bathwater was exactly 37 degrees , as prescribed by his physio ' up to age 14 he was as much football as tennis and he opportunity to do something with @entity191 when he was 14 - that 's when he made the decision to go into tennis			1
' and @entity148 was a pre-handicapper at golf when he was 16			0
' despite his talents , @entity14 says he has come to terms with the fact that he may not win @entity24 - and claims he is now a better player because of it			1
the @entity202 tennis ace said yesterday that his failure to win the championship last year had taught him not to put too much pressure on himself			0
speaking on the eve of this year ’s games at @entity209 , the world number two warned fans he could not guarantee a win - and that he was ‘ comfortable ’ with that			0
the little things : @entity21 credits her son 's success to the games she used to play with him when he was younger , which she maintains improved his hand - eye coordination he added that his new attitude would allow him to just ‘ go out there and play ’ - without worrying about letting anyone down			1
last year , when he lost to @entity103 , his devastation was plain to see on live television when he shed several tears on court			0
among the crestfallen crowd on the day were his girlfriend , @entity122 , and the @entity227 - both of whom were also crying			0
after that disappointment , he went on to beat @entity103 and win gold at the @entity232 - and also became the champion of the @entity234			0
@entity235 , nice’n easy colour advisor says : ' once you start seeing the signs of grey , you might want to embrace your silver tones			2
' the key is to keep your hair in great condition by having regular deep conditioning treatments and ensuring your ends are trimmed so hair stays vibrant and glossy			2
@entity246 does n't mean dull			0
' @entity246 hairs are actually colourless hairs within your own hair that soften the overall effect of your colour			2
' when covering them , i would always go for a shade or two lighter than your normal hair colour as this will even out the difference between the naturally faded hair and the " greys " , giving you back the all over intensity and depth of tone that you are used to ! '			2

normally blonde @entity21 , 53 , showed off grey hair at @entity24 today
arrived at @entity12 today to cheer on her son against @entity266
