battle : education secretary @entity1 is considering new anti-strike laws as he moves on to a ' war footing ' with the teaching unions @entity1 is considering new anti-strike laws as he moves onto a ‘ war footing ’ with teaching unions who are expected to launch industrial action over the end of national pay deals			1
under the reforms announced last week , teachers ’ annual rises of around £ 2,000 will be scrapped and head teachers given almost complete freedom to dictate salary increases based on performance in the classroom			1
the education secretary believes the reform , allowing heads to reward the best teachers and freeze the pay of the least effective , would improve state education and make teaching a more attractive career choice for high - fliers			1
but union barons have raised the prospect of industrial action , swiftly condemning the move as ‘ disastrous ’ and ‘ unfair ’ to long - serving staff			0
a senior source at the @entity33 said the measures under consideration include legislation to make it more difficult to call strikes , challenging strikes in the courts possibly including the @entity40 , and making it easier for academies to sack sub-standard staff			0

the figures are set by national pay bargaining and teachers move up the main pay scale according to length of service in the classroom			2
the system has meant that long - serving but under - performing teachers are paid the same as more capable colleagues			0
under proposed reforms , announced by chancellor @entity71 in last week ’s @entity116 , head teachers would in theory be able to promote a teacher from a starting salary to the maximum £ 51,000 in just six months			1
