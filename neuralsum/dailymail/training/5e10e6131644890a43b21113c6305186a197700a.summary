when police raided celebrated artist @entity3 ’s home searching for child pornography in 1993 , the art world rushed to his defence			1
his soft - focus , sexually suggestive paintings of naked young girls were found distasteful by many			0
but his illustrious supporters backed his insistence that ‘ the pervert is the one who puts the fig leaf on , not the one who takes it off ’			0
leading artist @entity17 , @entity3 ’s former tutor sir @entity18 , writer @entity19 and the photographer @entity20 were among those who proclaimed his innocence			1
guilty : @entity3 , 70 , was today convicted of four counts of indecency with a child by a jury at @entity27 eventually the photographs seized by the police were returned and @entity3 escaped charge			1
last night however the artist ’s mask of respectability was ripped off for good after he was convicted of a string of sex offences against three young girls who posed for him as models			0
as critics pointed out , his portrait painting had been a ruse to aid his abuse of children			2
@entity3 , 70 , faces jail after being found guilty of six counts of indecency with a child and one count of indecently assaulting a child			1
the court heard his victims were aged between six and 14 when he abused them after blindfolding them and dressing them in @entity53 nightgowns			1
now adult women , the victims told how he abused them between 1972 and 1985 at his home studios in @entity57 and @entity58			2
in some cases the girls were photographed indecently at the same time – and resulting portraits of at least one was then exhibited			0
at the peak of his popularity , @entity3 ’s paintings sold for £ 25,000 - a - time and were displayed at @entity57 ’s @entity65 and the @entity66 , and the @entity67 in @entity68			1
but his victims will be mystified as to why it took almost 20 years to finally bring him to justice			0
guilty : @entity3 pictured in his @entity72 studio during his three - week trial at @entity27 , @entity3 accepted he had taken photographs of scantily clad and naked children , but denied they were indecent and insisted he had not interfered with any of his underage models			1
however , prosecutor @entity79 said his victims gave strikingly similar accounts of abuse			0
the jury was told he would dress them in @entity53 - style nightgowns , then blindfold them and strip them naked			0
he would abuse them when their eyes were taped shut			0
another complainant said she was aged just six and was in a bath with another girl when the artist got in with them and forced her to touch him			0
@entity92 , who graduated from the @entity93 in 1968 , appeared to revel in the opportunity to defend himself and his art when giving evidence			0
he boasted he was ‘ one of the world ’s greatest printers ’ and in his defence quoted references from the @entity103 and his own books			0
@entity3 claimed he was the victim of a ‘ witch hunt ’ against artists brave enough to capture naked children in ‘ the state of grace ’ and told police he had created ‘ some of the best portraits of children in the last 200 years ’			1
when mr @entity79 said ‘ utterly vile ’ images found on the artist ’s computer showed his talk of high art was just a ‘ convenient cover story ’ for paedophilia , @entity3 said the only problem was the barrister ’s ‘ visual illiteracy ’			1
mr @entity79 said : ‘ the truth is you ’re sexually besotted with young girls			0
the proof of your obsessions are your images			0
’ @entity3 , who lives near @entity129 in @entity58 , was not in court to hear the verdicts after being taken ill at the weekend			1
the artist was found not guilty of abusing a fourth girl			2
in 1995 the @entity136 revealed detectives had been incensed by the decision to drop child porn ring charges against @entity3			1
three years ago he was cleared of 34 child porn charges			2
accused : @entity3 , 70 , still faces five further charges but the jury are still deciding their verdicts in the courtroom , @entity3 painted a picture of ' one of the world ’s greatest printers ' , an artist held in such high esteem his works were hung in the finest galleries across the world			1
under the early tutelage of the ' godfather of @entity155 ' sir @entity18 , @entity3 embarked on a career which catalogued life on the streets of @entity57 , offered acclaimed landscapes of the countryside , and portraiture of children			1
he had been tutored by lord @entity163 and sir @entity164 , attended the @entity165 , and graduated from the @entity93 in 1968			0
his work was displayed across the world , including exhibitions at @entity57 ’s @entity65 , the @entity66 and the @entity67 in @entity68			0
in 1975 he founded the artistic movement the @entity169 - artists who had left the city to live in the countryside			0
at @entity175 , his sprawling estate in the shadow of @entity129 in north @entity58 , greats of the art world would mingle and share ideas with each other , while parents - often single mothers and their children - were also welcome visitors to the property			2
but by 2013 , and long after the height of @entity3 ’s popularity had faded against a backdrop of police investigations for indecency , the artist ’s stories of working alongside some of the country ’s most celebrated visionaries seems like a distant memory			1
he remains at @entity175 , but in a converted outbuilding next to the turreted main home , known as the garage			0
his son is estranged , while friends say @entity3 has not sold a painting for some time			1
ill health has dogged the 70 - year - old , though his acerbic wit has not deserted him			1
appearing to revel under the spotlight of giving evidence in his own trial , the bespectacled @entity3 would summon references to the @entity103 , and to the great authors of times past , in an effort to support his point - that his work , which sometimes featured nude children , was something to behold with admiration as so many had done before , rather than something on which the case against him could be partly based			1
he also described the ' witch - hunt ' against artists brave enough to capture children in ' the state of grace '			2
during one chapter of the three - week trial , @entity3 even quoted from one of his own books , taking time to read a poem to the jury			2
frequently , calmly , he denied repeated prosecution claims that he is a paedophile - that his work demonstrated a sexual interest in children , and that he acted under the veneer of respectability			2
@entity3 would describe prosecutor @entity79 ’s ' visual illiteracy ' , and would also cite a ' day of reckoning ' for the police , including barbed allegations about members of the @entity238 who brought the claims against him			2
outside the court , during the days of evidence , @entity3 and his supporters said a dossier of evidence would be uploaded to the internet once the trial was over to support his veiled accusations against the police			1
in convicting him of sexual offences against children , the jury decided the world had heard enough lies .			0

@entity3 , 70 , not in court for verdict because he had been taken ill
described as a ' paedophile ' who abused children while they modelled for him
guilty of six counts of indecency with a child and one of indecent assault
