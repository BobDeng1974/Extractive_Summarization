by @entity0 last updated at 10:48 pm on 28th june 2011 one of @entity2 's former chiefs of staff launched a scathing attack on his old boss today , claiming she was ' decidedly ' not ready to be president			1
@entity7 , who worked for mrs @entity2 last year , described her offices as ' wildly out of control ' and criticised her for a lack of leadership experience			1
it came as the 55 - year - old attempted to mend her increasingly gaffe - prone reputation in a television interview this morning - only to make another historical mistake by claiming @entity17 was a founding father			1
under fire : @entity2 at a meeting in @entity22 , @entity23 , today , as her former chief of staff attacked for a lack of leadership experience in fact , he was just nine - years - old at the time of the @entity29			1
and yesterday , the @entity30 made another embarrassing gaffe , when she inadvertently compared herself to serial killer @entity33 instead of the actor			1
in an article for the @entity36 , mr @entity7 , who worked for mrs @entity2 for several months last year , says his former boss does n't have the leadership experience needed to be president			1
attack : @entity7 said his former boss @entity2 was ' decidedly ' not ready to be president he conceded she had ' great oratory skills ' , but added : ' she is not prepared to assume the @entity46 in 2013			1
' mr @entity7 , who served as chairman of the @entity48 from 2005 to 2009 , says he knows mrs @entity2 ' very well '			1
but he believes she offers no challenge to fellow candidate @entity50 , for whom mr @entity7 also worked			2
he was particularly scathing about mrs @entity2 's managerial skills			1
he wrote : ' the @entity2 campaign and congressional offices i inherited were wildly out of control			1
' stacks upon stacks of unopened contributions filled the campaign office while thousands of communications from citizens waited for an answer ' if she is unable , or unwilling , to handle the basic duties of a campaign or congressional office , how could she possibly manage the magnitude of the presidency ? ' today she was out on the campaign trail again at a meeting in @entity22 , @entity23			2
she formally launched her presidential bid yesterday , from her hometown of @entity73 , in @entity74			2
gaffe - prone : @entity2 launched her presidential campaign in @entity74 yesterday , but is already attracting criticisms for her inaccuracies she tore into president @entity79 as she sought to capitalise on a sudden surge in poll ratings , which have put her ahead with fellow candidate @entity83			1
rising star : @entity2 waves to crowds with her husband , @entity87 , after she officially launched her presidential campaign in @entity73 , @entity74 strong support : mrs @entity2 's address , at a mansion in @entity73 , won her rapturous applause - but today she was criticised by a former aide the @entity94 congresswoman has won support from many in the @entity96 for her hardline opinions on abortion and gay marriage , but she has also attracted criticism for her inaccuracies			1
according to @entity104 , a political fact - checking service , mrs @entity2 's record for inaccuracy is worse than all the other @entity30 candidates			1
yesterday she told @entity107 : ' well what i want them to know is just like , @entity33 was from @entity73 , @entity74			2
that 's the kind of spirit that i have too , â€™ she told @entity107			2
on the road : @entity30 presidential candidate @entity2 greets a young fan at a campaign meeting in @entity22 , @entity23 unfortunately for mrs @entity2 , that @entity33 is in fact @entity116 , also known as the ' @entity117 ' , who was executed in 1894 for raping and murdering more than 30 boys and young men			1
he was born in @entity121 , but later moved to @entity73 where he began his crime spree			2
although the actor of the same name is originally from @entity74 , he was in fact born in @entity125 - more than 150 miles away			1
@entity104 , a political fact - checking service , examined 24 of @entity2 's recent statements for their accuracy			1
it found just one to be fully true and 17 to be false - more than any other @entity30 candidate whose statements have been vigorously vetted			1
they include : the claim : ' the farm is my father - in - law 's farm			1
it 's not my husband and my farm			2
it 's my father - in - law 's farm			1
and my husband and i have never gotten a penny of money from the farm			0
' ( @entity144 ) the facts : in personal financial disclosure reports produced by members of @entity148 each year , mrs @entity2 said she holds an interest in a family farm in @entity151 , @entity152 , with her share worth between $ 100,000 and $ 250,000			1
the farm , which was owned by her father - in - law , produced income for @entity157 of at least $ 32,500 and as much as $ 105,000 from 2006 to 2009 , according to the reports she filed for that period			2
the farm also received federal crop and disaster subsidies , according to a database maintained by the @entity163			0
from 1995 to 2010 , the farm was given $ 259,332 in federal payments			0
when asked about the subsidies and her income from the farm late last year , a spokesman for @entity2 said only that she was n't involved in decisions about the running of the farm			1
yesterday she said her husband became a trustee of the farm because his father had dementia before he died two years ago , and he now ' oversees the legal entity '			0
she insisted she and her husband receive no farm income , despite the forms reporting it			0
the claim : ' if you look at one of our @entity182 , @entity17 , that 's absolutely true			0
he was a very young boy when he was with his father serving essentially as his father 's secretary			0
' he tirelessly worked throughout his life to make sure that we did in fact one day eradicate slavery			2
' ( @entity193 ) the facts : @entity17 was not a founding father			0
he was nine - years - old when the @entity29 was made and 20 when the @entity196 was adopted his father , @entity197 , was a @entity199 figure and an architect of the declaration - and therefore a founding father			2
both father and son became president			0
mrs @entity2 was defending her earlier , inaccurate remark that the @entity182 had devoted themselves to ending slavery			1
@entity17 , president from 1825 to 1829 , privately called slavery a ' great and foul stain ' , but largely sidestepped the issue in office , according to @entity213 's companion to the @entity214			0
he tried to avoid antagonising the @entity215 , while reasoning that his push for a stronger central government would hasten slavery 's end over time			0
the claim : ' well what i want them to know is , just like @entity33 was from @entity73 , @entity74 , that 's the kind of spirit that i have , too			0
' ( @entity107 ) the facts : @entity33 the actor was born in @entity125 , @entity74 , nearly three hours away , and moved to @entity228 in his childhood			0
@entity116 , convicted of killing 33 men and boys , was born in @entity121 , moved to @entity73 to work in his father - in - law 's chicken restaurants and first ran afoul of the law there , sentenced to 10 years for sodomy			2
he began his killing spree after his release , and his return to @entity240			0
@entity2 told @entity241 on tuesday her comments ' were just misspeaking ' and that her main intent was to show she identified with @entity33 's patriotism			1
the claim : ' overnight we are hearing that potentially 10 to 30,000 people could have been killed in the strike			0
' ( she was criticising mr @entity79 in may for the ' foolish ' @entity250 intervention in @entity251 , and citing what she said were reports of a civilian death toll from a @entity256 strike as high as 30,000 ) the facts : the @entity250 ambassador to @entity251 , @entity259 , said in late april that @entity250 officials have seen reports that 10,000 to 30,000 people may have died in @entity264 's crackdown on protesters and the fighting between rebels and pro-government forces , but it is hard to know if that is true			0
he was speaking about all casualties of the conflict ; no one has attributed such a death toll to @entity256 bombing alone , much less to a single strike			0
the claim : ' it 's ironic and sad that the president released all of the oil from the strategic oil reserve ... there 's only a limited amount of oil that we have in the strategic oil reserve			0
it 's there for emergencies			0
' ( @entity292 's @entity291 ) the facts : mr @entity79 did not empty all the oil from the strategic reserve , as @entity2 said			1
he approved the release of 30 million barrels , about 4 per cent of the 727 million barrels stored in salt caverns along the @entity301 and @entity302 coasts			0
it 's true that the @entity250 normally taps the reserve for more dire emergencies than exist today , and that exposes @entity79 to criticism that he acted for political gain			0
but the reserve has never been fuller ; it held 707 million barrels when last tapped , after hurricanes in 2008			0
the claim : ' that 's the number of new drilling permits under the @entity79 administration since they came into office ' ( comment to a conservative conference in @entity74 in march ) the facts : the @entity79 administration issued more than 200 new drilling permits before the @entity320 oil spill alone			0
over the past year , since new safety standards were imposed , the administration has issued more than 60 shallow - water drilling permits			2
since the deep water moratorium was lifted in october , nine new wells have been approved .			0

former chief of staff says @entity2 lacks leadership experience
@entity30 tries to make up for her historical gaffes - only to make another one
