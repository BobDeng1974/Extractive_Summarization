by @entity0 there has been an intriguing fall - out from @entity4 ’s latest attempt to prise @entity5 away from @entity6 , with suggestions in @entity8 that the experienced right - back may remain in the @entity10 but not at the @entity11			1
after tieing up the signing of @entity14 centre - back @entity13 on a two - year contract with an option for a further 12 months , @entity4 have turned their attention to recruiting a full - back , central midfielder and striker in an effort to spark an overdue revival in their fortunes			2
@entity5 is their first choice to fill the full - back position , and @entity27 understands a delegation from the @entity29 visited @entity30 in the last few days for negotiations about a summer move			2
@entity46 have not given up hope , but a source close to @entity4 said : ‘ the impression that came out of the talks was that @entity5 and his wife are settled in @entity30 and want to stay there			2
he is hoping @entity6 come up with an acceptable offer , but there is interest from other @entity10 clubs			1
we are hearing @entity44 and @entity45			2
’ after securing @entity13 ’s signature , @entity4 have distanced themselves from claims they may move for @entity6 defender @entity59			1
hands up : the right - back could yet stay at the @entity11 and sign a new deal politics could play a part in @entity6 ’s pursuit of @entity65 after his club @entity66 found themselves caught up in the escalating crisis over @entity69 ’s military movements in @entity70			1
while the rest of @entity73 condemns @entity69 ’s involvement in eastern @entity75 and calls for tough sanctions against @entity78 ’s regime , @entity66 ’s top brass continue to enjoy a close relationship with the @entity69 president			0
controversy : @entity65 's ( left ) , challenged by @entity82 , move to @entity6 could be boosted the @entity84 club have been sponsored by @entity85 since january , 2007 and wear the @entity69 government - backed gas company ’s name across the front of their shirts , much to the dismay of not only @entity93 activists but leading @entity95 politicians			1
increasingly , influential political figures in @entity95 are calling on @entity66 to cut their ties with @entity85 , so far to no avail			0
@entity66 chairman @entity99 admitted he has a direct line to @entity78 , and is on friendly terms with the @entity69 leader , but was adamant he will do all he can to resist pressure to end the partnership : ‘ are we still friends ? i am not a politician , but he shows his interest in our club by always asking about our results whenever we speak			2
it is a good relationship			0
’ however , with little indication political tension is about to ease over @entity69 ’s activities in @entity75 , pressure is likely to mount on @entity66 to seek alternative means of funding			0
it can only have a destabilising effect on the @entity84 club and increase @entity6 ’s prospects of convincing @entity65 he would benefit from a fresh start , when they resume their efforts to sign him in the summer			1
postal service : the situation in @entity69 may have given @entity124 greater hopes of signing @entity65 @entity126 is not @entity44 ’s only bargaining tool in their attempts to pep up their attack next season with the summer acquisition of @entity133 striker @entity132			1
a return to his former club and spiritual home could be on the cards for @entity126 , but @entity133 are much more likely to be swayed into sanctioning @entity132 ’s departure for @entity139 if @entity140 was included in the deal			2
and it does appear ever more likely that @entity140 would be happy to go along with it			0
now in his third season on loan at @entity133 , he is so enamoured with the lifestyle over there that he has been going out with a @entity133 girl for the past 12 months and has even bought a house in the @entity151 capital			0
you blue - ty : @entity153 is no 1 on @entity44 's strikers wanted list for the summer between the sticks : @entity133 want to sign keeper @entity140 on a permanent deal @entity44 have responded by offering him contract talks , but the outcome of those could hinge on his prospects of being installed as first choice ahead of @entity163			2
@entity27 understands the @entity165 keeper may ask for a guarantee that he will start as number one next season before committing himself to a new improved deal			0
if that proves a stumbling block , he knows he can count on just such an understanding at @entity133 , where his place has never been in doubt			0
‘ my future is unclear , and i do need to sit down with @entity176 and discuss it , ’ he admitted			0
in action : @entity126 could be in line for a return to his former club in return for @entity132 with @entity13 bound for @entity4 and @entity183 possibly heading for retirement , @entity59 could provide a short - term solution to @entity14 manager @entity186 ’ defensive requirements after stalling over the offer of contract talks at @entity6			1
@entity186 is scouring the market for top - quality candidates who can serve @entity14 ’s defence for years to come but may consider @entity59 ’s wealth of experience a useful addition to the ranks			1
on the sidelines : @entity199 defender @entity59 could provide a short - term solution for @entity186 the @entity202 defender , who can operate at centre - half or left - back , shares the same agent as @entity206 and is a close friend of the @entity14 striker			1
of even more interest to @entity186 is the response @entity59 gave to news that @entity6 are ready to begin discussions with him about renewing his agreement with them			1
as he considered his lack of starting opportunities this season , due to the form of @entity219 and @entity220 , he said : ‘ now is not the time for talking about new contracts			0
we can speak after the season has finished			0
i did not expect to play as little as i have , but the two defenders in front of me have played well and maintained their fitness			0
i just have to accept that			0
’ applause : @entity59 could plug a gap in defence for @entity14 boss @entity186			1

@entity5 may leave @entity6 for another @entity10 club
politics may help the @entity199 sign @entity65
@entity44 face a swap for @entity237 to land @entity132
@entity59 could plug a defensive gap for @entity186
