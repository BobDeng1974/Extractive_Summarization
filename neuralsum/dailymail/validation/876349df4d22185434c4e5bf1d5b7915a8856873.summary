former @entity1 captain @entity0 , legendary enforcer of @entity3 ’s 1961 double winning side , has died aged 80			1
in an age of hard men , the stockily built midfield man was one of the toughest , a symbol of passion and fiery commitment			0
for years the iconic picture of him angrily holding @entity12 ’ equally combative @entity10 was framed on the wall in the players ’ lounge at @entity16 , the club ’s spiritual leader long after he ’d left			0

born in @entity39 in 1934 , he was the second in a family of four boys whose father worked for the @entity45 newspaper			0
he began his career with his boyhood idols @entity48 , winning all three domestic honours before captaining the side in 1957 - 8 when they won the @entity53 title – setting a @entity55 record with 132 goals scored and only 29 conceded			0
that persuaded @entity3 to buy him in 1959 for £ 32,000 , a transfer that manager @entity24 later claimed was his greatest ever signing			2
he created a powerful partnership with @entity61 , and together they provided the driving force in the side that became the first post-war team to achieve the double of @entity53 title and @entity22			2
in all @entity0 played 318 times for @entity3 , twice recovering from a broken left leg to captain the side that won the @entity22 in 1967			1

' @entity0 challenges @entity79 's @entity78 during a game during the 1970s best again felt the full force of @entity0 's boot as the pair battle for the ball in 1971 the famous picture was taken on the first day of that season , when @entity0 reacted to a tackle he believed was designed to deliberately injure his bad leg			0
he was a powerful personality , the leader off the field in the days when the players would congregate in the @entity95 and @entity96 pub after matches , as well as the leader on the pitch			0
when @entity100 was forging the early days of his management career in 1968 he persuaded @entity3 to sell him @entity102 for a bargain £ 5,000 – and the @entity104 then became captain of the team that first won promotion to the old @entity108 , and then captured the @entity109 in their first season in the top flight			1
@entity102 with the @entity112 after their 4 - 1 victory over @entity79 @entity0 , who also played for @entity48 and @entity114 , was capped 22 times by @entity1 @entity0 with former @entity116 manager @entity100 and ex-chairman @entity117 at the @entity118 in 2003 sir @entity119 and @entity0 chat as they pose for pictures of their special stamps in 2013 he was jointly voted @entity124 in 1969 alongside @entity125 , and played 122 games in all for @entity116 before ending his career as player - manager of @entity114			1
that began a management career which brought more success , starting out with @entity132 and then peaking when in 1975 , appointed as @entity116 ’s manager following @entity100 ’s resignation , he guided the club to the 1974 - 5 @entity53 title			2
further jobs with @entity138 , @entity139 and @entity140 brought less success , however , and his career ended taking jobs in @entity144 and @entity145 before he retired from football altogether in 1995			0
