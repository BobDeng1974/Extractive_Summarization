@entity3 campaigners say the ancient name should be replaced because there is no ' v ' in the ancient tongue of @entity19			1
however , villagers fear they will be the butt of playground jokes if road signs are put up displaying the flatulent name			1
@entity25 , 42 , who lives in the village near @entity27 , @entity28 , said : ' just imagine how embarrassing it will be to have the word " fart " in your village 's name - never mind being followed by " egg "			2
' i 'd be humiliated every time i told someone my address			2
everyone will be laughing at us and coming to get photographed next to the street signs			2
' i just think it 's ridiculous - these @entity3 campaigners are a lot of gasbags , they ’re full of hot air			1
' fellow villager @entity48 , 62 , said : ' can you imagine the bus going past and some naughty schoolboy shouting : " you are going to @entity52 "			2
it is just a bad joke			0
' many road signs in @entity19 display place names in both @entity57 and @entity3 - and @entity59 council is now consulting on which form should be used in @entity4 , which has a population of about 1,000 people			0

' @entity4 is not an @entity57 word so translating it is totally unnecessary			0
“ it ’s a name that reflects our rich history and culture in the @entity90 , with its @entity3 language and @entity57 language influences			2
debate : a @entity59 council spokesman said changing the village 's current name to ' @entity7 ' would be ' inappropriate '			1
but the village could still have its name changed to ' @entity7 ' ' i ’m supportive of sensible steps to help the @entity3 , but this is not the way to achieve that - it will only fuel resentment			1
' the @entity3 alphabet traditionally consists of these 28 letters : a , b , c , ch , d , dd , e , f , ff , g , ng , h , i , l , ll , m , n , o , p , ph , r , rh , s , t , th , u , w , @entity116 ' is now often included in the alphabet , between the letters ' i ' and ' l ' a @entity59 council spokesman said changing the village 's current name to ' @entity7 ' would be ' inappropriate '			1
however , village could still have its name changed to ' @entity7 ' - with locals now being consulted about this			1
