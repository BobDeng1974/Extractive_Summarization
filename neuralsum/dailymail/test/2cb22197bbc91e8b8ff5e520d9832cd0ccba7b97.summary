residents in the otherwise immaculate cobbled cul - de - sac in @entity3 , one of the city ’s wealthiest areas , said the colourful redesign was driving them ‘ mad ’ and likened mrs @entity33 , believed to be in her early 70s , to ‘ a child throwing a tantrum ’			1
today @entity37 can reveal mrs @entity33 has also fallen out with the family of her late husband @entity39 , who have accused her of failing to pass on cash and property worth millions after his death in 2007			1
@entity43 , her stepson , said her behaviour does not surprise him , having last had contact with her in 2012 when they continued to row over the inheritance he believes is due to him and the wider family			1
he said : ‘ she has made commitments and reneged on them			0
she ’s an extremely unpleasant character '			0
his wife @entity54 claims mrs @entity33 's life revolves around money , which has left her estranged from much of her family			1
she said : ' she 's fallen out with the family			2
it 's sad , she is missing out on them growing up and getting married			0
but she 's not involved because of her decisions			2
' her husband promised money and property to his children and grandchildren but after he died it never materialised			2
they were promises my husband 's father made , but she has never kept one			2
' she 's so rude , in fact she is the rudest person i 've ever met			0
' money is not our god - but money is her god			0
we do n't need it to be happy , we are already , but it is for her			0
she 's got nothing else in her life , no friends , just her and her money '			0
ms @entity33 's original name is understood to be @entity86 , who later changed her name to @entity88 - the name of @entity91 ' wife - because of ' vanity ' , her family claim			1
she is the daughter of a second world war hero pilot , flying officer @entity94 , who was handed the @entity95 in 1942 for helping fly a bomber back to @entity97 from a @entity99 raid when the pilot was injured , saving the rest of the crew on board			1
but in 1943 he was shot down over @entity105 while heading to bomb @entity107 factories and buried in the @entity108			1
in may 2013 mrs @entity33 helped unveiled a memorial at the crash site to remember her father 's life and the others lost			1
@entity115 of a £ 15million townhouse in @entity117 , @entity3 - one of the most exclusive areas of @entity17 - have branded the property an ‘ eyesore ’ after it was painted with red and white stripes following objections to knock it down and replace it with a five - storey mansion memorial : in may 2013 mrs @entity33 , second from right , helped unveil a memorial at the crash site to remember her father 's life and the others lost when his @entity133 plane was shot down in 1943 residents surrounding her stripy @entity3 townhouse told @entity37 they are ‘ horrendously unhappy ’ with the new exterior of the three - storey terraced home in @entity117 , @entity3 , and likened it to a ‘ beachside hut ’			1
planning documents show mrs @entity33 wanted to replace the property with a five - storey ‘ traditional mews - style ’ home , including a two - story basement complete with gym , media room and swimming pool with a double - height ceiling			1
the new property could be worth £ 25million			2
hero : her father flying officer @entity94 , was handed the @entity95 in 1942 for helping fly a bomber back to @entity97 from a @entity99 raid when the pilot was injured , saving the rest of the crew on board the plans were initially turned down by @entity160 but approved on appeal			2
however , a neighbour then lodged a legal challenge which means the case will go to the @entity165 in june where a final decision will be made			0
residents now believe that mrs @entity33 , a property developer , ordered the garish paint job - which took place under the cover of darkness - as an act of revenge for the legal challenge			1
while mrs @entity33 ’s solicitors refused to comment yesterday on the motives behind the dramatic paint job , there is little doubt that it has rubbed the objecting neighbours up the wrong way			1
@entity181 , 18 , who lives opposite the house with her father , said the new colourful exterior had not gone down well with local residents , with the majority complaining that it lowers the classy tone of the quiet cobbled street			2
she told @entity37 : ' the neighbours are all horrendously unhappy with it			0
it 's a bit of an eyesore			0
' the woman who owns it put in a planning application to go down two floors but it was rejected and now we think she 's trying to do this so the council is forced to demolish it '			1
@entity202 , a chauffeur who works from the neighbouring road , said the property had been receiving lots of attention from tourists , who now regularly visit the quaint street to take photos			0
he said : ‘ in terms of the paint job , i just think it ’s really bizarre			1
i ’d like to know how they have got away with it			0
‘ surely it ’s a listed building or there must be restrictions			0
all of the windows on the street are exactly the same and when another property in the road wanted some work done there was a notice up for ages			0
i ca n’t see how they ’ve got away with it			0
’ the owner of the £ 15million @entity3 townhouse was once involved in a high - profile legal challenge over another property dispute			1
@entity0 , along with her husband @entity39 - who died in 2007 , four years into the marriage - , was the owner of @entity235 's @entity234 which became embroiled in a legal battle with property developer mr @entity237			1
the dispute began in 2002 when mr @entity237 verbally agreed to buy and redevelop a block of 13 flats in @entity241 owned by @entity235 's			0
at his own expense , it was decided that he would apply for planning permission for the development to turn the flats into six terraced houses			2
residents said they are ‘ horrendously unhappy ’ with the new exterior of the three - storey terraced home in @entity117 , @entity3 , which suddenly appeared after legal challenges thwarted a planning application to give the home a double basement to include a swimming pool the house ( pictured centre before the paint job which occurred in the last couple of weeks ) was bought by @entity0 several years ago and turned from office space into storage space			1
she now wants to turn it into a residential property measuring five - storeys ms @entity33 has submitted several planning applications but ultimately wishes to demolish the current property and rebuild it to take it from three - storeys to five - storeys with a double basement below ground			1
it will include four bedrooms , a gym , pool and media room the company would then sell mr @entity237 the property for £ 12million upon the planning application being successful , and when the work was completed , he would have to give @entity235 's 50 per cent of the profits if the sale was in excess of £ 24million			1
if the planning application was not successful , mr @entity237 would receive no payment			1
the contract was purely verbal and there was no written formal agreement or the instruction of lawyers			0
mr @entity237 spent about £ 200,000 obtaining planning permission between 2002 and 2004 and , on the day after the consent was granted , @entity235 's told him the agreement no longer stood			2
the firm claimed the agreement had lapsed as the consent had not been obtained within a set period of time and refused to sell him the land			0
mr @entity237 started legal proceedings , claiming the company had breached the verbal contract , and the case went to the @entity165			0
he said he should be paid for the work he carried out to obtain planning permission and also claimed a right to the land since its value had increased considerably thanks to the planning consent			2
the @entity309 ruled to award mr @entity237 a sum in excess of £ 5million but the @entity312 overturned the decision , claiming mr @entity237 was not entitled to ‘ property estoppel ’ because he did not have a formal contract			0
however , the @entity312 ruled that mr @entity237 was entitled to a sum for ' unjust enrichment ' and he was awarded around £ 200,000 to cover the cost of obtaining planning permission and a fee for his services			2
during the case , the @entity322 and the @entity309 criticised mrs @entity33 ’s conduct as ‘ unconscionable ’ and ‘ unpleasant ’			1
afterwards , solicitors @entity326 said the fact mr @entity237 had only been paid for his time and expenses meant ms @entity33 was ‘ laughing all the way to the bank ’			2
the @entity241 development , which is currently under construction , was described in objection letters by residents as something which would cause ‘ irreparable damage ’ to the ‘ quality of life and sense of community ’ on the street while ‘ solely benefiting the commercial developers ’			0
@entity235 's @entity234 is no longer active and it is understood ms @entity33 now splits her time between the @entity97 and @entity344 , with properties registered in @entity17 and @entity346			2
mrs @entity33 was unavailable for comment today but her solicitor said her @entity3 home was not bought for £ 15million and would not be worth £ 25million if the two years of proposed work is completed			1
he also denied claims by neighbours the stripes were painted during the night , backed up by the man who painted them			0
the tradesman , who did not want to be named , told @entity37 : ' it 's not true it was painted during the night			0
i did it in five hours during the day around six weeks ago			0
i was n't told why i had to do it , but i read in the newspapers it was to do with the neighbours ' .			0
