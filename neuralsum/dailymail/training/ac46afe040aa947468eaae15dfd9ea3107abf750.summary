fool me once shame on you , fool me twice shame on me			0
it 's a saying that 'll be ringing in @entity6 co-owner @entity5 ' ears all summer			1
the multi-millionaire businessman is due to head into a strategy meeting this week as the club starts preparing for their return to the top - flight			2
the futures of their current players will be top of the agenda , but their summer recruitment policy will not be far behind			0
all smiles : @entity6 's co-owner @entity5 , pictured celebrating saturday 's play - off win , will head the summer strategy meeting changes : @entity6 manager @entity23 knows he has work to do to keep his club in the @entity25 but anyone expecting another money - going - out - of - fashion style spending spree at @entity30 are likely to be disappointed			1
@entity5 claims he is wiser after having his fingers burnt during the club 's previous @entity25 tenure			1
high transfer fees and high wages spent on the likes of @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 and @entity40 did not work out as planned			2
not only that , it has left the club facing a staggering Â£ 50million fine for breaching @entity41 regulations			0
the prospect of such hefty punishment alone will ensure the club are more prudent this summer			0
experience : with around 750 club and international appearances @entity49 would be a high - profile signing indeed , sources at @entity6 insist the club are keen to stress the days of extravagant spending on high - profile stars are over			1
the way player contracts are structured is under review , with the club keen to move away from paying high basic salaries ; instead moving towards incentive - based deals			1
@entity6 officials feel that will help them avoid players who are intent on using @entity5 ' riches as a vehicle to earn a quick quid			2
such an approach is likely to prove problematic when trying to attract top - level stars to @entity30 this summer but it is an approach the club are willing to take to ensure they do not sign players who only want a ride on the money train			0
@entity76 : @entity78 's @entity77 could be tempted to join @entity6 , who can now offer @entity25 football quality costs nothing : @entity49 ( left ) and @entity83 ( right ) have both been linked with free transfers to @entity6 manager @entity23 knows he 'll need to add some @entity25 know - how to his ranks this summer			1
@entity78 midfielder @entity77 is on @entity23 's radar and out - of - contract stars @entity83 and @entity49 could also be targeted			0
at first glance , @entity6 would be falling into the same old traps by targeting those three former @entity93 players			2
but the trio have worked under @entity23 before ; developing close relationships with the 67 - year - old in the process			0
gifted : young talent @entity98 has impressed whilst on loan and could move permanently rangers are also considering turning @entity98 's loan deal permanent ahead of next season			2
despite not featuring at @entity104 on saturday , there 's a willingness to complete a full - time move for the 21 - year - old midfielder , who has 12 months left on his @entity109 contract			0
@entity98 fits the profile of player @entity6 would prefer to target this summer : young , talented and with something to prove			2
toon : @entity113 striker @entity37 is unlikely to return to @entity6 after his loan spell at @entity115 before pressing ahead with those moves , @entity23 must decide on which players he wants to keep at the club			1
big - earners such as @entity120 , @entity121 , @entity122 , @entity123 and @entity124 are all out of contract this summer			0
likewise , players like @entity37 , @entity127 and @entity128 are all due to return to @entity30 following loan spells away			1
@entity37 is set to leave this summer , while @entity127 and @entity128 are unlikely to feature in @entity23 's plans for next season			1
there are plenty of questions			0
we 're about to find out the answers			0
sales : both @entity127 ( left ) and @entity128 ( right ) are unlikely to return at the end of their loan spells			1

@entity5 has ' learned *lessons* ' from last time in @entity25
the club are set to dispense with high basic contracts
@entity37 , @entity127 and @entity128 could all be sold
@entity6 could end up targeting on - loan @entity98
