by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 17:03 est , 6 december 2013 updated : 17:04 est , 6 december 2013 the number of elderly people ‘ living in sin ’ with unmarried partners has doubled in a decade , it emerged yesterday			1
in 2001 , there were just 8,000 people in their late 80s and 90s who declared they were cohabiting without being married			1
but as attitudes to relationships have become increasingly liberal , this has now jumped to 16,000 , according to the @entity13			1
the figures , compiled from census forms , suggest elderly ‘ silver sinners ’ are increasingly shunning tradition and defying stigmas about living with a partner out of wedlock			0
the number of divorcees over the age of 85 in @entity24 and @entity25 has also more than doubled to 33,000 in the past decade			1
relaxed relationships : the number of people in their late 80s and 90s cohabiting without being married has doubled in a decade , figures reveal @entity30 , a family lawyer at @entity31 , said : ‘ whereas people aged 80 and over might once have remained in an unhappy marriage because they feared that they might not have too many years of life left , now they are determining that they want to enjoy the rest of their lives and not necessarily remain in a relationship which is n’t working for the sake of it			1
‘ we have seen a number of older clients who want to test the water , who want to cohabit either with a view to marrying at some later date or maybe not			2
‘ older people now believe the social stigma which previous generations associated with living together and not being married just does n’t apply to them any more as it does n’t to younger age groups			1
’ the revealing statistics come as the number of people living to the age of 85 has increased by a quarter in just ten years and women now outnumber men by two to one			1
in 2001 , there were just over one million people were in the ‘ oldest of the old ’ age group , but that total grew by around 250,000 to 1.25million in 2011			1
women in this group outnumber men by two to one - but the men ’s numbers are up by nearly half in a decade			0
this has been attributed to fewer people smoking and the decline of heavy industry			2
seven in ten of those women live on their own - a total of nearly half a million - and those numbers are growing			0
charities said the figures showed more help was needed to help older people live fulfilling lives and not just get by			2
aging population : the number of people living to the age of 85 has increased by a quarter in just ten years to 1.25million @entity79 , charity director for @entity80 , said more needed to be done to ‘ ensure that people in later life are able to thrive , not just survive ’			1
she said : ‘ it is a cause for celebration that the number of people reaching their 85th birthday and beyond is rising			1
‘ significant improvements in healthcare , public health and living conditions at all stages of life have led to real improvements in both life expectancy and in older people ’s health			2
‘ however living a longer life does not necessarily mean living a healthier life , and there are still huge disparities in healthy life expectancy across the country making it ever more important that as a society we are fully prepared to adequately meet the needs of our ageing population			0
' the figures show there are 850,000 women and 410,000 men aged 85 and older living in @entity24 and @entity25			2
the number of men has risen by 45 per cent in a decade , from 280,000 in 2011 , compared to a rise of just 16 per cent among women , from 730,000			2
women aged over- 85 are more likely than men to be living alone , the figures show			0
in 2001 there were 103,563 men and 398,498 women living alone			0
by 2011 that increased to 150,000 men and 474,000 women			0
nearly seven in ten women live alone , compared to 41 per cent of men - who are also more likely to be married			0
for every 100 women aged 85 and over , 77 were widowed , 13 were married and ten were either single , separated or divorced			0
but almost half of men were still married , 43 per cent were widowed and just nine per cent were single			0
the @entity13 said : ‘ recent gains in life expectancy mean that more people are living to the age of 85 and beyond			1
‘ in the future more of the population , who are now just entering old age , will live to be 85 or older			1
the oldest old are among the most vulnerable in our society , but are also among the most resilient			0
‘ for some , but by no means all , their advancing years affects their physical and mental health , increases their level of dependency on others and the amount of support that they require from family , private and public institutions			0
’ around one in ten men and one in five women live in a care home or other ‘ communal establishment ’ .			0

in 2001 , 8,000 unmarried people in their 80s and 90s were cohabiting
this has now jumped to 16,000 according to the @entity13
number of divorcees over age of 85 has also more than doubled to 33,000
