by @entity0 published : 10:05 est , 1 july 2013 updated : 10:05 est , 1 july 2013 an astronaut aboard the @entity2 has become the first person ever to control a robot on earth from space			2
flight engineer @entity7 remotely controlled the @entity9 rover based in @entity10 from space to simulate deploying a radio telescope			1
the mini mission was designed to test how well a crew member in space can remotely control a robot , whether it is on the surface of a moon , planet or asteroid			1
@entity7 took the rover , based at the @entity22 in @entity10 , on a remote test drive before using it to deploy the simulated antenna			1
@entity26 's @entity9 rover , based at the @entity22 in @entity10 , performs a surface survey controlled by an astronaut on the @entity2 aboard the space station , he used live video from the rover and virtual terrain displays to give him a view of the rover 's activities on @entity37			1
the technology demonstration aimed to explore how communication delays over vast distances affect an astronaut â€™s ability to take supervisory control of an automated rover if it gets into a difficult area			0
@entity46 , director of the @entity47 at @entity22 said : ' we successfully conducted the first " surface telerobotics " test session with the @entity2			0
' @entity7 used @entity9 to perform a surface site survey and to begin deploying a simulated @entity54 film - based radio antenna			1
' astronaut @entity7 controls the rover from the @entity56 aboard the @entity2 @entity7 uses the surface telerobotics technology ( pictured ) to drive the rover on earth before performing the delicate operation of deploying the simulated antenna			2
the demonstration aims to explore how the communication delays over vast distances affect an astronaut 's ability to operate a robot @entity46 told @entity67 that further test drives between the rover and the space station will take place in july and august			1
they will concentrate on completing and inspecting the antenna deployment as well as studying the interaction between the human and the robot			0
the test is the first simulation of a human - robot ' waypoint ' mission , which involves an idea to deploy a telescope on the far side of the moon			2
the concept is proposed by experts at the @entity85 and @entity86 , which is building the multi-purpose @entity88 spacecraft for @entity26			0
the @entity9 rover carries out a surface study using its cameras and on - board laser system			1
such a robot could be used to deploy a radio telescope on the far side of the moon in the future the proposed mission to the @entity99 position , would see astronauts on board an @entity88 spacecraft remotely place a low radio frequency telescope on the far side of the moon , using robots			1
the aim of the mission is to track down the ' cosmic dawn ' of the universe that followed within 100 million years of the @entity109			0
the location has been chosen as it is a ' radio quiet place ' in the inner solar system , which will allow sensitive observations to be made about the first stars and galaxies			0
@entity7 was one of the astronauts to make a rare , hastily planned space walk from the @entity2 in may this year			2
he helped to replace a pump outside the station to plug a serious coolant leak			0
ammonia coolant was leaking from the power system on board the @entity2 .			0

@entity7 remotely controlled the @entity9 rover based in @entity10 from space to simulate deploying a radio telescope
the *experiment* was designed to see how well a person can operate a robot from such a vast distance
@entity133 could contribute to a proposed mission to place telescope on the moon
