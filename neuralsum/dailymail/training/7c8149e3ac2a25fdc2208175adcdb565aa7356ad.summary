by @entity0 when @entity1 crosses the finish line in the @entity3 next month , win or lose , his bid for a @entity6 will be over and horse racing will begin its annual retreat from the mainstream			1
for once , that could come as a relief to the people who run @entity13			2
their biggest weeks of the year are the run up to and right after the @entity16 , which @entity1 won back on may 3			1
but it 's been a rough stretch for the track 's image , the latest issue being the death of a horse thursday in a fall on the track that her trainer immediately blamed on the sound system attached to @entity13 's vaunted new video board			1
sudden start : a racehorse died thursday , may 22 , 2014 , at @entity13 after a freak fall that the trainer blamed on the sound of a starting gate bell blaring on the track 's new sound system here 's a look at some of the public relations problems the sport 's most famous track has faced this spring			1
firstly , the debut of the world 's biggest hd video screen - the ' @entity45 , ' @entity13 dubbed it - and its 750 - speaker sound system were the track 's biggest bragging point going into @entity16 week			1
towering 170 feet over the backstretch , the high - definition , $ 12 million video screen is bigger than three basketball courts , bigger than any single panel of the giant display hanging above the field at @entity57 , home of the @entity58			2
in a press release , @entity13 bragged that the screen is five times the size of the average home - that 's the equivalent of 2,200 46 - inch flat - screen tvs or 320,000 @entity65 screens			1
smitten by the close - up view of the action it gives those in the infield and the grandstand , many fans loved it right away			0
some trainers and jockeys did n't			0
the day before the @entity16 , jockey @entity76 called the speakers ' overwhelming ' minutes after she won the @entity78 aboard @entity79			2
@entity76 said it did n't seem to affect her horse , however , and several trainers have said they have n't had problems with the speakers			0
on thursday , five - year - old mare never tell @entity86 was walking toward the paddock on the track when she reared , twisted and fell , hitting her head , said her trainer , @entity90			2
the horse was startled by what @entity90 thinks was the sound of a starting gate bell coming from a commercial on the video board			0
oversized : the new screen and sound system was a hit with punters but jockey and trainers were n't impressed ' we teach horses to break from that , ' he said			1
' and you 've got it on a loud speaker that everybody in a two - city block can hear			0
well , what 's she going to do ? she thinks she 's supposed to take off			0
and that 's what she did			0
and when she did , she lunged and she lost her balance and went down			0
' track officials extended their condolences after the horse was euthanized , called the accident extremely rare and said they were still gathering the facts			0
@entity90 said the sound system was ' way too loud ' at the time of the accident			1
' the only thing you can blame is the music , ' @entity90 said			0
' they 've got to do something about it ... the horses are the main thing here			0
' the second problem for @entity13 was when weeks before the @entity16 , a spokesperson announced @entity13 would take a bigger cut of the money bettors place on its races			1
the decision came after @entity140 lawmakers rejected the racing industry 's latest effort to add slot machines to generate more cash to boost prize money for horse owners			2
honored guest : the jockey who rode @entity149 to @entity6 victory in 1973 @entity151 has accused @entity13 of ' snubbing ' him @entity13 spokesman @entity152 said without the bigger cut , the track would have had to reduce the prize money for winners of spring races and some races would likely have been cut altogether			1
horse players at the betting windows grumbled that @entity13 , of all places , should have enough other means of revenue without having to pinch pennies from people who come to the track			2
the third issue happened days before the @entity16 , when @entity13 rushed into damage - control mode after @entity168 jockey @entity151 , who rode @entity149 to @entity6 glory , declared he would skip seeing the @entity16 because track management had snubbed him			1
@entity151 , who is paralyzed , said he could n't get a parking spot during his last @entity16 visit , and then could n't even get into the track to watch last year 's race			1
the track said any perceived snub of @entity175 was the result of a ' communication breakdown			0
' @entity151 's comments were posted on the website of a horse farm run by @entity181 , who owned @entity182 , the filly that was euthanized on the track after breaking both of her front legs following a second - place finish in the 2008 @entity16			1
@entity188 nightmare : @entity1 co-owner @entity189 has also accused the race track of being less than hospitable @entity181 had posted about his own difficulties in obtaining tickets to watch one of his horses race at @entity13 on friday , and in getting @entity16 tickets last year for four @entity197 veterans who were part of the d - day invasion			1
' what is wrong with this management group ? ' @entity181 wrote			0
' no wonder racing is on the decline			0
' @entity189 , co-owner of this year 's @entity16 and @entity206 winner , @entity1 , lashed out at @entity13 after the @entity206 , which is held at the @entity207 in @entity208			1
' @entity13 needs to call @entity209 to get a lesson in hospitality , ' @entity189 said			2
' these people right here , they 've treated us like royalty			0
' co-owner @entity217 did n't make the trip to @entity207 , and @entity189 was asked why			0
' the hospitality we received at @entity13 was n't very good , ' @entity189 said , so @entity217 decided not to make the trip to the next stop on the @entity6 trail .			2
