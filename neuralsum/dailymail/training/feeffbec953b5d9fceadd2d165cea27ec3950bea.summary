by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter retired special needs teacher @entity3 died after waiting two hours for an ambulance , despite his family making seven 999 calls a pensioner died after an agonising two - hour wait on his bathroom floor for an ambulance			1
@entity3 , 73 , collapsed at home but was not regarded a ‘ red ’ emergency despite seven desperate 999 calls			1
by the time a rapid - response team arrived the retired teacher had gone into cardiac arrest and it was too late to save him , an inquest heard			1
incredibly , the first crew to turn up at his @entity22 home were from the charity first aid service @entity24 – who were replaced once the seriousness of the situation emerged			1
ambulance bosses say they lacked the resources to meet demand that night and were hit by delays caused by a lack of hospital beds			2
a coroner has ruled that mr @entity3 might have been saved if medics had reached him sooner , branding the tragedy a ‘ sad consequence ’ of a lack of ambulances			1
saying his death was aggravated by a ‘ lack of timely and appropriate medical intervention ’ , @entity22 coroner @entity40 added : ‘ had there been more ambulances available the outcome might have been different			1
‘ it would appear to be a consequence of stretched resources , perhaps doing the best they can , but people are not receiving the service they might feel entitled to occasionally			0
‘ my concern is the time it takes for deployment and when [ an ambulance ] does attend it is manned by a charity			2
’ on the day of the tragedy last april , mr @entity3 , who was recovering from shoulder surgery , told his wife @entity62 , 70 , he was feeling unwell			2
a doctor who visited failed to find a serious problem , but offered to send him to hospital – which he refused			0
he collapsed at around 10.20am , when his carer called 999 , telling call handlers about the doctor ’s earlier visit			1
although they were told mr @entity3 could n’t move , his condition was not deemed a ‘ red ’ case and he was allocated a 60 - minute response time			1
mr @entity3 , pictured with his wife @entity62 , 70 , ' could have survived ' had medical help reached him earlier , a coroner has ruled mr @entity3 collapsed and died on the bathroom floor at the flat he shared with his wife @entity62 , in @entity22 ( pictured ) last april it was midday by the time an ambulance arrived – and it was a @entity80 vehicle			1
once the seriousness of the situation became apparent , an ambulance with an eight - minute response time was summoned and eventually arrived along with a rapid response car			1
by then it was too late , and mr @entity3 was pronounced dead after a ten - minute battle to save his life			1
mr @entity40 ruled the former special needs teacher died of natural causes			1
@entity92 dr @entity91 said mr @entity3 had an underlying heart condition – which was worsened by the stress of being on the bathroom floor for so long			1
@entity96 , a dispatch manager for the @entity97 , blamed problems on a high number of urgent calls that day			0
she said there had also been delays in admitting patients to @entity104 because of a lack of beds – which she described as ‘ a national problem ’			0
' he gave his life to helping others and the ( ambulance ) trust failed him in his moment of need ' - @entity3 's family the inquest heard mr @entity3 ’s carer and relatives made calls to the 999 and 111 emergency numbers – both of which are handled by the same call centre in @entity124			1
but the coroner was told there was nothing in the computer software to flag up that the family had called before			2
calls to both numbers are processed in a similar way , but the two systems are not linked – so handlers taking 999 calls will not know if 111 staff have dealt with the same patient			0
assistant call centre manager @entity139 said a request had been made to hook up the two systems but coroner mr @entity40 described it as ‘ a big gap ’			1
bosses at the @entity97 admitted they did not have the ' resources to meet demand ' , adding it was a ' national problem '			0
the coroner ruled had mr @entity3 received medical attention sooner , it is likely he could have survived mr @entity3 ’s family hit out at the ambulance service trust ’s failure to grasp the seriousness of the situation until it was too late			1
speaking after the inquest , they said : ‘ this should never happen again to anyone			0
we simply want recognition from the trust that a mistake was made , and that the trust failed a fantastic man			0
‘ he gave his life to helping others and the trust failed him in his moment of need			0
we hope they will make sure as best they can this will never happen again to another family in @entity22			2
’ @entity172 , head of the @entity97 ’s contact centre , apologised to the pensioner ’s family for not getting to him sooner			2
he said : ‘ mr @entity3 did n’t receive the level of care that he should have done			0
’ ambulance services across the @entity179 categorise each call according to how serious the patient 's condition is			2
the aim is to ensure the most serious , life - threatening calls are dealt with first			0
the categories are nationally agreed , by the @entity186 and each ambulance service across the @entity179 are measured according to required targets			0
- @entity190 most serious category , @entity191 is reserved for those patients who have suffered traumatic life - threatening injuries or those who are displaying the signs of suffering a heart attack or cardiac @entity199 ambulance is expected to reach a patient within eight @entity202 possible two ambulance crews are dispatched to @entity191 calls - commonly a rapid response car , who can make initial assessments and start to treat the patient at the scene , followed by an ambulance , who can transport the patient to hospital			2
- @entity214 second most serious category is for all other life - threatening emergencies			0
examples include patients who have suffered a stroke , with serious symptoms or those who are struggling to @entity221 to @entity191 ambulance crews are expected to reach the patient within eight minutes of the 999 call being logged			1
for both @entity190 calls the response times are set out as national requirements rather than recommended times			0
the guidelines dictate that an emergency response - usually in the form of a rapid response car - will reach 75 per cent of these calls within eight minutes			0
where onward transport to hospital is required , 95 per cent of life - threatening calls will receive an ambulance capable of transporting the patient within 19 minutes of the request being made			0
- @entity240 are serious but not life - threatening calls , for example diabetic problems or a suspected stroke with no serious @entity245 1 call requires an emergency response within 20 minutes			2
- @entity248 deemed serious but not life - threatening , @entity250 2 calls can include suspected fractured arms or legs , or a patient who has fallen and maybe @entity255 calls require an emergency crew to be on the scene within 30 minutes			0
- @entity258 are non-emergency calls which require an on - scene response within 60 minutes or an assessment over the phone from the clinical support desk within 20 minutes			2
a patient who has suffered a suspected overdose , but is showing no serious symptoms , or someone who has suffered a non serious injury would be classified as a @entity270 call			0
- @entity271 are the least serious calls , which require emergency crews to be sent to the scene within 90 minutes or a telephone assessment within an @entity276 scalding , a fall with no apparent injuries or someone in pain , but showing no serious symptoms would be classed as a @entity250 4 999 call			1
response times for @entity250 calls are recommended and are set locally rather than being national requirements .			0
