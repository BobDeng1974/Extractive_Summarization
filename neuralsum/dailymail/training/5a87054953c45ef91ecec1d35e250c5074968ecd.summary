an 81 - year - old @entity1 man met his son for the first time on sunday			1
@entity4 of @entity5 was cleaning out some filing cabinets following the death of his wife when he discovered a letter written over 50 years by a woman revealing that she had given birth to a son , and he was the father			1
that son , @entity13 , who was just five - years - old when the letter was written , is now 61			1
' she wanted children , ' said @entity4 of his late wife in an interview with @entity27 17			1
' she could n’t have any			0
' that being said , @entity4 still seems to resent her decision , no matter what her motivation may have been , saying ; ' he ’s my full son that i ’ve had my whole life , but why my wife hid that letter is beyond me			1
' the reunion was just as poignant for @entity13 , who long ago resigned himself to the fact that he had been abandoned by his father			2
' just to know him now is so important to me			0
it ’s going to fill that void , ' said the man , who spent his youth in @entity44			0
lost time : @entity13 ' mother wrote @entity4 with the news of his son over 50 years ago , but his wife hid the letter ( above ) as for the letter , written in 1959 , it began ; ' i have a little boy			1
he is five years old now			0
what i ’m trying to say @entity4 is he is your son			2
he was born november 14th , 1953			0
' when he never responded , @entity13 ' mother simply assumed the man wanted nothing to do with the boy , and informed the child of his decision			2
' i always asked my mom , i said , " well what does he look like ? " ' says @entity13			2
' she said , " well , go look in the mirror			0
" ' and while the two men are enjoying their time together , and all the catching up they have to do , they are still planning a paternity test just to make certain this news is not too good to be true .			0
