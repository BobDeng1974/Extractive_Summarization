@entity0 might be inclined to spend the last two weeks of may hiding behind his sofa , hoping against hope that his @entity4 plans are not wrecked by the business end of the club season			1
@entity8 ’s head coach will name a preliminary training squad of around 45 players in the middle of that month , before the semi-finals of the @entity13			1
clubs such as @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17 — who provide large contingents to the national squad — are bound to be involved in those blood - and - thunder matches and there is a significant risk of untimely injuries as the league campaign reaches its anticipated explosive climax			2
@entity0 will name his 45 - man preliminary @entity4 squad before the @entity13 semi-finals @entity0 must then reduce his squad to 31 players by for the @entity4 on august 31 @entity8 will have a final @entity4 warm up match against @entity33 at @entity34 a day after the @entity13 final at @entity34 on may 30 , an @entity35 made up of emerging rookies will face the @entity38 at @entity39			1
the senior players will reconvene to begin their summer training camp in @entity42 on june 22 , and the two weeks from july 13 will be spent at altitude in @entity44 — @entity45 ’s ‘ @entity44 ’			2
a week off upon their return from the @entity48 will be followed by a return to camp as @entity8 prepare for one experimental encounter with @entity52 at home , followed by a return fixture in @entity55 which they intend to treat as a more full - on @entity57			1
@entity0 must announce his final @entity4 squad of 31 on august 31 , before a final warm - up match , against @entity33 at @entity34			1
explaining the schedule of events as the tournament countdown intensifies , @entity0 said : ‘ the training camp will start on june 22 and the wider squad will be about 45			1
it will be announced mid-may , before the @entity38 game , which is the same weekend as the @entity13 final			0
‘ the side to play the @entity38 will probably be made up of younger players			0
no - one in the squad will play in that , though one or two who have had injuries might come back into the equation			2
‘ from a selection point of view , we will use the first warm - up match to look at wider options			0
as you narrow down to the second game , the @entity4 squad and the @entity33 game , they will be proper games then			1
’ however , @entity8 will not wait for their encounters with @entity52 and @entity33 to assess their players ’ credentials in match conditions			2
the plan is to host in - house matches of their own			0
@entity0 explained : ‘ we ’ll spend a lot of time with proper 15 - on - 15 games internally anyway			2
‘ we ’ll make sure the players are put under that sort of test - match pressure			0
@entity8 will also play @entity52 twice in the build up to the @entity97 @entity98 was cited for his challenge on @entity100 but no further action will be taken @entity0 's side beat @entity52 55 - 35 in the @entity103 on saturday but did not secure the title ‘ we have two high - quality teams now and you can replicate the intensity on training alone			1
they will vary in intensity as we go through june and july			0
‘ when we go to @entity44 , we were thinking of bringing in opposition , but actually we ’re probably better off having a bash against each other			0
’ one man who certainly ‘ had a bash ’ against @entity52 on saturday was @entity98			0
the @entity15 lock was reportedly cited by the visitors after his monster hit on @entity52 fly - half @entity117 , but the match commissioner has seen no need to take the matter any further .			0
