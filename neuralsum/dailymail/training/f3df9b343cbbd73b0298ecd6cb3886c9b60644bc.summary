home favourite @entity0 was one of four @entity1 at the top of a crowded leaderboard after the first round of the @entity5 in @entity6			1

the 27 - year - old won his first @entity15 tournament at the @entity16 in july and , after not playing the opening two events of the season , was glad to be back in action			2
another home favourite , @entity22 , watches his drive off the 10th tee during the first round @entity0 leads the @entity5 ' i was nervous starting , ' he told www.pgatour.com			1
' it has been a while since i played a golf tournament			2
i took the first two tournaments off because i was n't quite ready to go so i was n't quite sure how things were going to go			2
' it was windy , it was cold this morning , it was tough conditions and i just outlasted it and finally started getting comfortable and playing better and finished real nice			2
' starting on the back nine , @entity0 bogeyed 14 but followed that with two birdies and reached the turn in 34			1
the birdies were coming in bunches and @entity0 picked up further shots on three , four , seven and eight to get off to a good start in a season that will see him make his @entity47 debut at @entity48 in april			1
' after you win , you kind of feel invincible for a little while and feel like you ought to win every week but it just does n't turn out , there are so many factors that go into it , ' he said			0
' so work hard , see what happens , do your best and stay patient			0
that 's what i 'm trying to do			0
' fellow @entity61 alumni @entity11 also carded six birdies and a bogey to hold a share of the lead and @entity10 's scorecard also showed just the one dropped shot			1
' if you get it going the greens are really quick and they 're very true , ' said @entity11			1
' so if you 're playing well i think there 's some good scores out there			0
' conditions i think will definitely get tighter during the week and ( these are ) definitely the fastest greens we 've putted on in a while so you 've got to be careful			0
