this was quickly followed by another in which he wrote ; ' look , i ’m trying to offer you another opportunity to see our children			0
but as usual you would much rather be with your friends			0
' according to the @entity44 , prosecutors in the case argued that @entity20 was not even aware the texts were coming from @entity46 , and actually believed they were coming from the woman he was dating at the time			2
this seems to be backed up by the woman 's responses to these texts , as she wrote in one ; ' if i were you i ’d get the hell away from him			2
' on the day the boys died , @entity5 also sent a photo to @entity20 that appeared to show @entity10 dead and dangling from the closet with rope around his neck			1

' we were operating on the belief that @entity10 was dead , ' @entity78 said			2
' we did n’t know about the older son			0
' that is when they found a tarp in the crawl space under the home			1
' we saw four little feet inside the tarp , ' @entity91 said			0
' one of the feet had a shoe on it			0
it was a little camel tennis shoe and that ’s how we knew			0
we never laid eyes on the bodies other than to see those feet			0
' prosecutors claim that @entity5 strangled both boys with handle of a cloth grocery back before putting their bodies in a pillowcase that he then wrapped in a tarp and shoved into the crawl space			1
@entity5 's bizarre 911 call shortly after he killed the boys was also played for the jury this week , in which he told the operator ; ' my girlfriend asked me to kill my babies			1
what was i supposed to do ? my girlfriend told me to kill both of them			2
what was i supposed to do ? i hate her , i hate her , i hate her so much			0
i ’m so scared now			0
