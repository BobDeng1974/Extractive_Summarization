by @entity0 , education correspondent pupils in @entity3 are among the worst - behaved in the developed world , research has found			0
the government and @entity7 ‘ seriously underestimate ’ the scale of classroom indiscipline , which affects nearly all schools , says a study			1
even many institutions which are popular and over-subscribed are plagued by bad behaviour			0
the worst schools suffer disruption every day , getting in the way of learning			0
picture posed by models schools with the worst problems face serious disruption every day – pupils screaming obscenities , threatening staff , swearing , spitting and refusing to behave when asked			1
poor parenting and pressure on schools to avoid expelling troublemakers are thought to be fuelling the crisis			1
but the @entity31 and @entity7 seem unaware of the extent of classroom disruption – claiming that behaviour in 99.7 per cent of schools is satisfactory			1
professor @entity36 , an education expert at the @entity37 , cited international evidence that teachers in @entity3 face more difficult pupil behaviour than in many rival nations			0
his research highlighted findings from the @entity44 which administers the world ’s biggest education survey , known as @entity48			0
@entity44 members include most of the world ’s wealthy nations			0
‘ some data from @entity48 research … suggests that teachers in @entity3 may be teaching in more difficult contexts than their counterparts elsewhere , ’ his report says			0
@entity3 , for example , slumped to 32nd place out of 38 for the proportion of students who reported that ‘ their teachers never or rarely have to wait long for them to quieten down ’			0
behaviour problems could explain @entity66 's falling test scores , experts claim			1
picture posed by models a further @entity48 report found that in @entity3 , 31 per cent of pupils report that ‘ in most or all lessons there is noise and disorder ’			2
professor @entity36 suggests the poor behaviour may partly explain the superior performance of countries such as @entity79 and @entity80 in international school tests			1
many lessons in @entity3 are simply designed to keep control and involve ‘ defensive ’ strategies such as using textbooks and worksheets or showing the pupils a television programme , he says			2
testimonies from teachers paint a disturbing picture of behaviour in some schools his paper , published today in the journal @entity95 , is based on four studies conducted over ten years			2
three focused on teacher perspectives of behaviour while the fourth surveyed 700 secondary school pupils			2
testimonies from teachers paint a disturbing picture of behaviour in some schools			2
one said : ‘ it is a condition of working at this school that you have to face serious disruption on a daily basis , pupils screaming obscenities , refusing to comply with requests to stop appalling behaviour , threatening , spitting , swearing			0
‘ you feel wretched for the poor kids who would like to learn			0
’ study blames poor parenting and refusal to expel problem pupils			1
picture posed by models professor @entity36 ’s study found that ‘ at least to some extent , behaviour was an issue which affected most schools ’			2
it added : ‘ one of the most striking aspects of the teacher testimony was the number of teachers who had obtained posts in popular , over-subscribed schools , but nonetheless admitted to having to work hard to get complete control of some of their classes			0
’ it also exploded the myth that poor behaviour is mainly a problem in inner - city schools			1
‘ small semi-rural schools also encountered significant problems with poor pupil behaviour , ’ it said			1
professor @entity36 said @entity31 claims – based on @entity7 findings – that behaviour in 99.7 per cent of schools was satisfactory , and good or better in 92 per cent , were misleading .			1

@entity150 and @entity7 underestimate lack of discipline , says study
poor parenting and *reluctance* to expel pupils blamed for problem
nearly one in three pupils say there are problems in ' most or all lessons '
experts says this could explain why the @entity66 is falling behind in test scores
government claims behaviour is at least ' satisfactory ' in 99.7 *%* of schools
