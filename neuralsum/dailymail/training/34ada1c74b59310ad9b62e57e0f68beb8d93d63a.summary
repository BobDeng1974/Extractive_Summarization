the old saying healthy body , healthy mind has been proved true in physically fit children			0
@entity4 researchers have shown for the first time that youngsters who are more aerobically fit have more ‘ white matter ’ in their brains , which is a marker for better memory and attention			1
a new study used brain imaging to explore the link between body and mental fitness in nine and 10 - year - olds			1
those rated at a higher level of fitness also had brains with more fibrous and compact white matter , the network of nerve fibres important for sending signals between different brain regions			2
physically fit children have more ' white matter ' in their brains , associated with memory , learning and attention , a team of researchers at @entity30 found joint study author @entity34 , of @entity30 , said : ‘ previous studies suggest that children with higher levels of aerobic fitness show greater brain volumes in gray - matter brain regions important for memory and learning			1
‘ now for the first time we explored how aerobic fitness relates to white matter in children 's brains			1
’ she said the study found significant fitness - related differences in the strength of several white matter tracts in the brain connecting different regions			1
dr @entity34 said : ‘ all of these tracts have been found to play a role in attention and memory			0
’ it suggests that white matter structure ‘ may be one additional mechanism by which higher - fit children outperform their lower - fit peers on cognitive tasks and in the classroom , ’ she added			2
although the study did not test for cognitive differences in children with different fitness levels , previous research has found fit adults perform better on white matter - related tasks			1
psychology professor doctor @entity73 said : ‘ previous studies in our lab have reported a relationship between fitness and white - matter integrity in older adults			0
‘ therefore , it appears that fitness may have beneficial effects on white matter throughout the lifespan			2
’ the researchers looked at 24 children given scans using diffusion tensor imaging ( @entity90 , also called diffusion @entity91 ) to investigate five white matter tracts			2
white matter describes the bundles of nerve fibres carrying signals from one brain region to another , with more compact white matter linked with faster and more efficient nerve activity			0
the scientists found children with a higher level of fitness , had ' greater brain volume ' in gray - matter regions the scans analyse water diffusion into tissues , with less water diffusion denoting more fibrous and compact material with ‘ desirable traits ’ , says a report in the journal frontiers in @entity116			1
researchers took into account factors such as social and economic status , the timing of puberty , iq , or a diagnosis of adhd or other learning disabilities that might have affected the reported fitness differences in the brain			0
the analysis revealed significant fitness - related differences in the integrity of several white - matter tracts in the brain			0
to take the findings further , the team is now two years into a five - year trial to determine whether white - matter tract integrity improves in children who begin a new physical fitness routine and maintain it over time			1
c - researcher professor @entity140 said : ‘ prior work from our laboratories has demonstrated both short and long - term differences in the relation of aerobic fitness to brain health and cognition			0
‘ however , our current trial should provide the most comprehensive assessment of this relationship to date			0
