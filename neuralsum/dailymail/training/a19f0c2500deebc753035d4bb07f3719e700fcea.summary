by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter published : 00:24 est , 31 august 2012 updated : 08:56 est , 31 august 2012 @entity4 chief @entity3 and @entity6 ceo @entity5 have been locked in behind - the - scenes talks following @entity6 's $ 1billion court victory proving @entity9 did copy their smartphone technology			1
the two executives had a phone conversation last week , the sources said , amid speculation the search giant could be next in @entity6 's sights			1
discussions involving lower - level officials of the two companies are also ongoing			0
last friday , a jury awarded @entity6 $ 1.05billion in damages and set the stage for a possible ban on sales of some @entity9 products , most of which use @entity4 's @entity29 software			1

the @entity29 software first came out on the market when @entity4 's then - ceo @entity35 was serving on the @entity6 board			1
the @entity37 reported that after shoving @entity35 off @entity6 's board , @entity38 vowed that @entity6 would resort to ' thermonuclear war ' to destroy @entity29 and its allies			1
he declared @entity29 a ' stolen product '			0
while @entity38 is no longer at the helm of @entity6 and their ensuing legal battles , his determination to kill the @entity29 software platform may be ingrained in the corporate mindset			1
secret talks : @entity4 chief @entity3 , left , and @entity6 ceo @entity5 are reportedly holding discussions about mobile patent disputes between the two technology giants page and @entity5 are expected to talk again in the coming weeks , though no firm date has been set , the sources said on thursday			1

@entity4 was forced to issue a statement on monday following the judge 's ruling , to shareholders			0
it said the portions of @entity9 's smartphones which were found to be copied do not apply to their software			2
if that is the case , then @entity6 will have no case against @entity4			2
' the court of appeals will review both infringement and the validity of the patent claims			0
most of these do n't relate to the core @entity29 operating system , and several are being re-examined by the @entity77 , ' the statement said			0
@entity6 on monday gave a federal judge a list of eight @entity9 products it wants pulled from shelves and banned from the @entity83 market , including popular @entity85 model smartphones			2

one possible scenario under consideration could be a truce involving disputes over basic features and functions in the @entity29 mobile software , one source said			0
the ' pinch - and - zoom ' feature now used on most smartphones and tablets is particularly under threat following the patent infringement battle			0
scorched earth : @entity38 was said to promise ' thermonuclear war ' against @entity4 after then - ceo @entity35 ( right ) was on @entity6 's board when @entity4 released their @entity29 software but it was unclear whether @entity3 and @entity5 were discussing a broad settlement of the various disputes between the two companies , most of which involve the burgeoning mobile computing area , or are focused on a more limited set of issues			1
competition between @entity4 and @entity6 has heated up in recent years with the shift from pcs to mobile devices			2
the popularity of the software has been in tandem with tit - for - tat patent infringement lawsuits slung by both sides			0
the latest complaint was filed by @entity142 , now a unit of @entity4 , against @entity6 at the @entity144 claiming some features of @entity6 's devices infringe on its patents			1
claims : @entity6 filed its lawsuit in april of last year alleging that 28 @entity9 smartphones and computer tablets had ' slavishly copied ' the iphones and @entity98 a previous lawsuit between the two in a @entity156 court was thrown out by a federal judge , who said neither side could prove damages			1
@entity6 in recent months has moved to lessen its reliance on @entity4 's products			2
@entity6 recently unveiled its own mobile mapping software , replacing the @entity4 product used in the @entity164 , and said it would no longer offer @entity4 's @entity165 as a pre-loaded app in future versions of its @entity164			1
@entity5 took the helm at @entity6 a year ago , and @entity3 stepped into the top job at @entity4 a few months before that			0
