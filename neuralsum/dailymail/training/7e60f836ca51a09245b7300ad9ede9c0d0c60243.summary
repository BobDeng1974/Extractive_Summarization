by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter published : 00:21 est , 17 august 2012 updated : 01:45 est , 17 august 2012 accused : @entity3 , 58 , pictured in 2009 , has been imprisoned for the past three years awaiting trial for the death of his third wife , @entity6 a forensic pathologist who performed a second autopsy on @entity3 's third wife years after she was found dead in her dry bathtub testified thursday that there 's just one plausible explanation for her death : she was murdered			1
but under aggressive questioning by the defense , dr. @entity15 conceded that some of his well - respected counterparts disagreed and still maintained her death was an accident			1
a coroner initially ruled @entity6 died in an accidental fall in her bathtub			2
her 2004 death was reclassified a homicide only after @entity3 's fourth wife , @entity26 , vanished in 2007 and @entity15 did his new examination			1
testifying for a second day thursday , @entity15 told jurors he did n't believe a single , fatal slip could explain how @entity30 had a fresh gash on the back of her head and a pattern of deep bruises on the front of her body			1
‘ i could n't see how that could happen , ’ @entity15 testified			2
@entity15 , a key witness for the state , was subject to aggressive questioning by the defense later in the day			2
over the objections of prosecutors , the judge let defense attorney @entity46 ask if three other pathologists who reviewed autopsy data still held @entity30 died accidentally			2
‘ despite their opinion , you say homicide ? ’ the attorney asked			0
‘ i have n't changed my opinion , ’ @entity15 responded			2
@entity15 also denied @entity46 's suggestion that he manipulated his autopsy results to mesh with @entity59 state 's attorney @entity58 's theory that @entity30 was murdered			1
@entity15 testified earlier that @entity30 's circular tub also had no edges pronounced enough to cause the two - inch , straight - line wound on her head			1
also , the position of @entity30 's body in the tub - face down and with her feet jammed against the sides of the tub - did not support a theory that she slipped and hit the back of her head , he said			1
@entity3 , a 58 - year - old former suburban @entity75 police officer , has pleaded not guilty to first - degree murder in @entity30 's death			1
he is also a suspect in @entity26 's disappearance , although he has never been charged in her case			2
authorities presume she is dead , though a body has never been found			0
grave charges : @entity3 is accused of murdering @entity6 , left			1
it was initially thought that she had drowned accidentally in the bathtub , right , but after her body was exhumed her death was ruled as a homicide @entity3 's attorneys maintain the original , 2004 autopsy on @entity30 's body by dr. @entity93 was sound and that his finding of an accidental death holds up			1
under cross examination by @entity46 , @entity15 conceded that the coroner who deemed @entity30 's death accidental had been respected in the field			1
‘ he did an orthodox and professional autopsy ? ’ the attorney asked			0
' yes , sir , ’ @entity15 responded			0
earlier in the day , @entity15 testified that it was ‘ extremely rare ’ for an otherwise healthy person to accidentally drown in a bathtub , unless alcohol or drugs were factors , which , he said , were not in @entity30 's case			1
he also described how @entity30 's body was partly mummified and skeletonized by the time he examined it in 2007			1
he said decomposition was accelerated because water had gotten into her coffin			0
but , he said , autopsy work could still be performed			0
forensic pathologist @entity15 told jurors he did n't believe a single , fatal slip could explain how @entity30 had a fresh gash on the back of her head @entity15 said he cut into parts of @entity30 's body , including on her hip , to discover that some bruises went almost to the bone , suggesting a major force caused the injuries			1
@entity15 also looked at photographs from the original autopsy and crime scene to make his determination			2
at one point , defense attorney @entity135 asked @entity15 if the bruise on @entity30 's lower left side could have been caused by banging into a door a suggestion that plunged the courtroom into a pandemonium as the defense and prosecution started yelling objections over one another , the station @entity134 reported			1
@entity46 also repeatedly challenged @entity15 about how he could be sure @entity30 's bruises were freshly made before she died , suggesting a struggle or beating preceded her death			1
the defense attorney suggested there were other indications the bruises were at least days old			0
@entity15 also conceded that no skin or blood was found under @entity30 's fingernails , which could have been an indication that she had been involved in a desperate fight for her life			1
‘ you would expect that during a struggle , there would be ... dna or tissue underneath the fingernails ? ’ @entity46 asked			0
‘ if the victim scratched the assailant , there may be			0
@entity172 , ’ @entity15 responded			0
during thursday ’s testimony , the prosecutors suffered a potential blow to its case when the judge barred them from implying that @entity3 tried to stage the death scene by placing a blue bath towel on the edge of the dry tub shortly after @entity30 ’s body was discovered , according to the @entity183			1
the neighbors who found the woman dead in the bathroom testified that it was odd there were no towels around , but a blue towel was later photographed on the tub			0
judge @entity191 barred prosecutors from implying that @entity3 must have left the towel because every other witness denied placing it there			2
on tuesday , judge @entity191 lambasted prosecutors who for the third time in as many weeks broached a subject they were told not to mention in front of jurors -- again raising the possibility that the case could end with the judge letting the former police officer go free			0
blunders : the judge at @entity3 's murder trial on tuesday lambasted prosecutors , namely @entity211 seen here , who for the third time in as many weeks broached a subject they were told not to mention in front of jurors @entity191 seemed unmoved by repeated apologies by an attorney for the state and said he would rule wednesday on whether to declare a mistrial in a case beset by problems from its outset			1
just two hours before , @entity191 had told prosecutor @entity211 not to ask a witness about whether @entity30 had sought an order of protection against @entity3 in front of the jury			2
when she did , he told jurors to leave the room and berated the prosecutor			0
' there was one thing i told you not to go into and that 's exactly what you did , ' @entity191 told her			0
the error came just as the trial seemed to be going prosecutors ' way in recent days , with the judge granting them permission to present hearsay evidence central to their case			0
@entity245 , or statements not based on the direct knowledge of a witness , is not usually admissible in court , but @entity250 passed a law – known as ' @entity252 ' - in the wake of the @entity3 case that allows it in certain circumstances			2
prosecutors have acknowledged they have no physical evidence linking @entity3 to @entity30 's death , so hearsay evidence about what @entity30 allegedly said to other people is crucial to their case			1
in memoriam : flowers and a small angel statue surround the grave marker of @entity6 , the third wife of @entity3 , at the @entity267 in @entity268 , @entity250 the mistake also came as @entity270 was questioning one of the state 's most compelling witnesses so far			1
former police officer @entity274 had just told jurors about interviewing @entity30 in 2002 after @entity3 allegedly broke into @entity30 's home in a @entity278 uniform and repeatedly pushed her to the ground			1
at one point , @entity30 allegedly told @entity3 , ' go ahead and do what you came to do : kill me , ' @entity274 testified			2
' he said , " where do you want it ? " and she said , " in the head			0
@entity3 then allegedly told @entity30 to turn her head , which @entity30 did , @entity274 said , based on what @entity30 told her			1
' and then he said , " i ca n't kill you , '' she told jurors			0
@entity3 then threw a garage opener to the ground and left			0
shortly after @entity274 finished telling that story , @entity270 turned and asked , ' did she tell you she wanted to get an order of protection ? ' the defense objected to @entity270 's question , and the judge asked jurors to leave the room			0
missing : @entity3 , left , is also the chief suspect in the disappearance of his fourth wife , @entity26 , right defense attorneys asked not only for a mistrial but for a ' mistrial with prejudice , ' meaning @entity3 could be set free and never be charged again with @entity30 's murder			1
declaring a mistrial with prejudice is a rare judicial step			0
@entity191 could also declare a more standard mistrial , meaning @entity3 would be retried later			0
the judge could also instruct the jury to disregard what the prosecutor said			0
if he takes that route , it could still signal to jurors that prosecutors have -- again -- messed up , potentially influencing their decision during deliberations			0
defense attorney @entity325 cited other times prosecutors broached prohibited subjects , including when @entity328 -- just 10 minutes into his opening statement -- referred to an accusation that @entity3 once tried to hire a hit man			2
' it is an avalanche of prejudicial , illegal evidence that is polluting this jury , ' he said			0
' to have this many ... errors , how can the defendant get a fair trial ? '			0

@entity3 pleaded not guilty to murdering his third wife , @entity6 , in 2004
only charged with @entity30 's murder after his fourth wife went missing
dr @entity15 said he could not see how a slip in the tub could account for a gash on @entity30 's head and other bruises
@entity15 denied a claim made by the defense that he manipulated his autopsy results
the coroner said @entity30 's circular tub had no edges that would cause a straight - line wound
