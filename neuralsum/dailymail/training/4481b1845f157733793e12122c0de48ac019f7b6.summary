a fifth of young married brits have admitted removing their wedding ring before going out with friends or after a row with their partner , new research has revealed			1
while both men and women are now more likely to wear a wedding ring than previous generations , those under 40 are also more likely to remove it , the study of 2,000 married couples showed			1
the most common reasons people gave for removing their rings were that they felt they got more attention from the opposite sex without a ring , that he ring was uncomfortable and that they were cross with their other half and wanted to make a point			1
a fifth of young married brits have admitted to removing their wedding ring before going out with friends or after a row with their partner one in eight said thought they would be judged as ' boring ' if people knew they were married while more than a third blamed it on work and said they had a better chance of winning business if they did n't wear a band			1
men were most likely to take their ring off before socialising while women were more likely to remove their after a fight			1
but more than eighty per cent of those men had been caught by their wives and only half of those had managed to talk their way out of it			0
the research which polled 2,000 married couples was commissioned by @entity46 as part of their annual marriage study			1
@entity49 , family lawyer at @entity46 , said : ' we often have clients who have been frustrated by their partner 's reluctance to wear a ring , particularly in certain circumstances			1
i have dealt with a lot of clients whose relationships breakdown because of a lack of trust between them			0
' as wearing a wedding ring has become more popular it seems that couples are more likely to take offence or consider it a sign of infidelity if someone refuses			2
more men than ever before have a wedding band and this research shows that women like this but unfortunately rings are easily removed and this can cause trust issues and confusion among couples			0
men were most likely to take their ring off before socialising while women were more likely to remove their after a fight ' i have had men coming in saying they have caught their wife not wearing her ring so it is n't just men who are guilty			2
but it is often hard for people to understand why someone would remove a ring without a very legitimate reason			2
' despite this both men and women under the age of 40 attached more significant to wearing a wedding band and were also more likely to be hurt if their partner refused to wear one than older generations			2
unlike their fathers and grandfathers younger men see wearing a wedding band as an important part of their marriage and unlike their fathers and grandfathers younger men see wearing a wedding band as an important part of their marriage commitment and are 27 per cent more likely to wear a band than over 40s			0
the change in trend for seems to have been driven by women who place more emphasis on their partner wearing a ring and 28 per cent said they would find it disrespectful if their partner refused or took it off			0
a fifth of women under 40 said they thought a man who did n't wear a ring did n't take his marriage as seriously and a quarter said it would make them suspicious			1
in comparison older women did n't mind if their husband chose not to wear one and thought it was less important than wearing one themselves			0
more than a third of married couples under 40 said that they would be more assured that their partner would n't cheat on them if they wore a ring as it would be a reminder of their commitment			1
@entity49 , family lawyer at @entity46 said : ' in the modern age ' double rings ' are clearly more popular than ever before but it 's worrying that younger people are placing so much emphasis on jewellery			2
a ring is n't going to stop a relationship falling apart and couples should n't rest easy that they are in a happy relationship just because their partner wears a ring			0
' the ring is just a symbol of love and commitment , a materialistic symbol			0
it wo n't stop someone straying and essentially a ring comes off very easily			0
' one in ten said they thought their wedding ring was often seen as a ' challenge ' by the opposite sex with men saying they felt they got more attention from women after they started wearing a wedding band while women said they got less attention once they started wearing a wedding ring			1
but nearly two thirds said that other people saw the ring and respected the fact that it meant they were in a committed relationship .			0
