' i wanted to do something to raise awareness of breast cancer and to thank @entity28 , which has supported me through all of this			2
' when @entity6 first started her challenge she was pleased to realise that she had raised £ 1000 in just two days @entity81 has had to be very creative to come up with all of her ideas but she says that they have been helping her get through the process of chemotherapy this brilliant straw head - dress makes @entity6 look a little bit like a scarecrow as the straw covers her bald head during her journey @entity6 says that her friends have been kind enough to help her out not only with support , but with lending her some of her head gear miss @entity6 was applying moisturiser to her body after a shower when she discovered a lump on her breast in july last year			1
she was diagnosed with an aggressive form of breast cancer , and within weeks she had surgery to remove the tumour and affected lymph nodes from her right breast			0
the operation was a success , but in october she began chemotherapy to ensure any stray cancer cells would be caught , too			2
miss @entity6 said : ' i went to the doctors about something unrelated to all this and just mentioned i 'd been getting some dry skin under my arm pit			2
' i was told to start using moisturiser after my shower to help prevent it , and one day when i was putting my body lotion on , i lifted my arm up and felt this lump on my breast			0
' the following day i went to my gp , who referred me to the local breast care clinic			0
within two weeks i was told i had a very aggressive form of cancer			0
it was such a shock - it still has n't quite sunk in now			0
' this look , which features long strands of chain dangling down into @entity6 's face would n't be out of home in @entity135 's wardrobe @entity6 says that the news that she had cancer still has n't really sunk in but her friends and family have been a great support maybe @entity6 was hoping to catch some rain water with this hairband complete with a bucket attached to it she continued : ' soon after i had the operation to remove the tumour from my breast and remove the affected lymph nodes from there , too			2
' the doctors think it went well as they ca n't see any more cancer there , but they still wanted to do the chemotherapy , just to be on the safe side			2
