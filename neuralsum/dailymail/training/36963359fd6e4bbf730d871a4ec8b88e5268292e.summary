the figures show that more than a third of people calling the lines in some areas either hung up or were cut off before they managed to speak to anyone			1
data shows the percentage of calls to police 101 numbers which are being dropped has risen			1
file photo the 101 number was introduced across @entity21 in 2011 and 2012 to replace individual police station numbers and cut the number of time - consuming 999 calls			2
but the new figures show that , despite the number of calls to the line falling by more than 100,000 over the last year , the percentage of calls answered is falling			1

' each call centre costs money , and right now taxpayers are n't seeing value for money			1
we need to improve 101 service significantly by finding inefficiencies in the system , or look at whether it is worth continuing			0
' the police forces with the quickest average answer time were in @entity88 , @entity89 , @entity90 , @entity91 and the @entity92 , where calls were answered after an average of seven seconds			1
@entity50 stated : ' the @entity95 is undergoing significant change in merging three centres into one single site			0
this was due to be live on the 1st of april 2014 , however due to issues with technology this has been delayed until november 2014			0
' the impact of this delay on performance has been significant as we are operating with the reduced staffing levels required for one site but remaining operational across three sites			0
performance is expected to significantly improve from november 2014 onwards			0
