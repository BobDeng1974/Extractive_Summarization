@entity0 awoke this saturday morning marvelling at how @entity2 boxer of all time has fought off @entity4 ’s for so long to reach the grand old age of 73			1
the most powerful nation on @entity7 will then hope to celebrate @entity9 ’s birthday by finally reclaiming a major portion of the world heavyweight title , which it was once accustomed to brandishing as the symbol of its manhood			2
@entity9 , having emerged miraculously from yet another hospital scare , is expected to spend his evening watching on television as the latest @entity0 contender for his throne strives to bring home the most cherished of the heavyweight belts			1
@entity9 will turn 73 on saturday and has recently survived another hospital scare @entity9 , shown at a training session in @entity24 , @entity25 , in 1974 , was diagnosed with @entity4 's 30 years ago @entity9 makes a face during a press conference in @entity28 to promote his fight with @entity30 in 1974 @entity31 , another black @entity32 of the prize ring , will be in @entity34 challenging @entity35 for the @entity37 title having vowed : ‘ @entity9 ’s crown is coming back where it belongs			1
’ since the boy from @entity42 , @entity40 has flattened all his 32 professional opponents thus far inside four rounds , the @entity0 is agog that he will deliver on that promise			0
that sense of impending destiny is encouraged by the return to the boxing big time of the larger - than - life promoter who staged @entity9 ’s epic @entity52 with @entity30			1
@entity53 is back in electrified business as the svengali of @entity56 , the first @entity58 - born heavyweight champion of the world			2
but his presence in the @entity61 will be seen as a key piece in the jigsaw of @entity0 fight history slipping into place			0
@entity53 has promoted 12 of @entity0 ’s 13 @entity0 - born @entity37 heavyweight champions			1
the only exception was the first to wear that belt , @entity69 , who was sensationally knocked out 41 years ago next month by @entity9 in his first incarnation as a brash young man called @entity9			1
@entity31 will be looking to hit the jackpot in @entity34 this saturday when he faces @entity35 @entity31 , pictured punching @entity73 , will fight @entity35 on saturday promoter @entity53 , who publicised the @entity52 , will be back on saturday as well although he hopes that @entity35 , who now fights out of @entity77 , will withstand @entity31 ’s all - american hammer blows , @entity53 ’s real achievement at this moment is his re-emergence from the boxing shadows in his 80s			1
the nostalgia which will accompany him at ringside in @entity34 will be all the more profound given the coincidence of a birthday which @entity9 was not widely expected to reach			1
this is an occasion awash with statistics , starting with that of no @entity0 having held so much as a particle of the heavyweight championship for almost a decade			0
yet the most remarkable figure is 30 , the number of years since @entity9 was first diagnosed with @entity4 ’s			1
the average survival span while suffering from this pernicious affliction is 16 years			0
by that estimation it is extraordinary that @entity9 has lived beyond his late 50s			0
@entity9 stands over fallen challenger @entity69 in @entity97 , @entity98 , in may 1965 the ' @entity99 ' between @entity9 ( right ) and @entity30 ( left ) in @entity24 , @entity25 , in 1974 thirty years , going on 31 now , is a monumental tribute to the fighting spirit which continues to infuse @entity9 ’s life so long after it galvanised the hardest game of all , nerved him to champion civil rights in @entity0 , steeled him to oppose the @entity106 and even now rouses him to condemn the violent extremists who pervert the religion to which he converted			1
@entity4 ’s has virtually silenced what was once the most loquacious tongue in sport but it has not dulled a kaleidoscopic mind as dazzlingly brilliant as his footwork and handiwork in the ring			0
to sit with him , as i did at his 70th birthday dinner in his home town @entity120 and during his visit to the @entity122 , is to see the lights in those penetrating eyes fully switched on			0
far from surrendering to the ravages of disease , or even complaining of it , he has used its restrictions as a cocoon for quiet reflection on his life and times			0
much of the energy he husbands is expended on the many charities which benefit from his thriving foundation , for which he often travels to @entity120 from his latest home in the soothing warmth of @entity139			0
yes , he looks frail at times			0
no , he does not look enfeebled			0
@entity9 has his gloves strapped by @entity141 during a training session in september 1965 the greatest boxer of all time speaks and gestures after a fight in august 1978 concern for his well - being is at its most acute at times of medical alarm			1
the most recent emergency admission to hospital came amid reports that he had contracted pneumonia , one of the most frequently fatal conditions for @entity4 ’s sufferers			2
by the time he was discharged , last week , after a fortnight much of which was spent in intensive care , that diagnosis had been revised to a urinary tract infection			0
that is not always good news , either , but he has rebuffed it with the fortitude with which he resisted the sledgehammer punches of @entity69 , @entity30 and so many others in a golden era for heavyweight boxing			0
of course , having the resources to finance the finest and most expensive specialist treatment helps prolong life expectancy in cases like his			0
@entity9 , pictured in march 2012 , adjusts his glasses on stage at @entity9 's celebrity @entity175 @entity9 holds a drink following a fight in august 1978 as he wears a dressing gown thus it is by protecting her husband ’s finances and maximising his income potential that his devoted fourth wife @entity186 confounds those , mostly among @entity9 ’s old guard , who frown upon the public appearances to which she gives her approval , be they glittering social functions or the funerals of old rivals such as @entity195 who were expected to outlive him			1
and no - one knows better than she how much he still relishes being in the spotlight of public attention			0
this is one of the world ’s greatest showmen , lest we forget , and had he been confined to a rocking chair on his porch we would surely have mourned his passing years ago			1
as it is , @entity9 will be watching intently as @entity31 goes in @entity208 pursuit of the one heavyweight belt not in possession of @entity211			1
the @entity37 title slipped from the grasp of that @entity215 family , which put down 16 years ago its first marker in what has become virtual world heavyweight domination , when elder brother @entity221 retired			1
@entity9 ( right ) steps up to the ropes to confront @entity223 during their bout in august 1978 a reunification fight with @entity211 is envisaged , one of giant proportions if @entity31 , also 6ft 7in tall , beats @entity229			2
if @entity31 were to go on and usurp @entity211 , @entity0 would have its first superhero heavyweight since @entity231 and @entity232 back in the hey - day			2
for the moment it will settle for is first winner of a heavyweight title by any alphabelt since @entity239 in 2007 , its first of the hallowed @entity37 championship since @entity241 one year before that			2
and that would be the best birthday present @entity2 of them all could receive			0
@entity31 ( right ) , pictured punching @entity248 in october 2013 , is determined to claim the world title * @entity229 v @entity31 will be televised live on @entity251 from 2.30am sunday morning .			2
