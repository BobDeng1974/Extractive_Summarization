a @entity1 woman who was expecting to find a tax refund in her mailbox was shocked when she instead received a letter from the @entity5 informing her that she had ' died '			2
@entity10 , 25 , is still living and breathing , a fact she proved when , after the @entity5 told her to contact her local @entity7 office in @entity8 , she walked right in and announced ' i 'm alive ! ' the staff told @entity10 that someone had filed her social security number as deceased in november 2014			1
@entity10 said the office implied she would be fine and that ' everything 's taken care of '			2
@entity10 , 25 , was expecting to find a tax refund in her mailbox when she instead received a letter from the @entity5 informing her that she had ' died ' but fast - forward three months later and @entity10 said she has n't received instruction from @entity7 on how to proceed and her number has yet to be reinstated - leaving her life in total disarray			1
@entity10 still has n't received her tax refund , one of her credit cards was cancelled , and even her driver 's license , which she was meant to renew , now lists her as deceased , she told @entity29 17 west @entity1			1
and now @entity10 's benefits and even her job as a licensed pharmacy technician could be in jeopardy if the problem is n't fixed			2
' everyone has to be licensed in the state of @entity1 by the end of june , ' she said			0
' and so if i do n't get this taken care of soon , i will essentially be out of a job			0
' @entity10 's local @entity7 office told her that in november 2014 someone had filed her social security number as deceased			1
she said they implied she would be fine and that ' everything 's taken care of ' but fast - forward three months later and @entity10 's @entity7 number has n't been reinstated			1
she also can not renew her driver 's license , has not received her tax refund and had one of her credit cards cancelled @entity53 , a deputy regional communications director for @entity7 , told @entity29 17 that @entity10 's situation is very rare			1
he said about 9,000 living @entity55 are misreported as deceased to the administration , making up 0.35 per cent of three million annual deaths			0
but @entity10 is part of that small percentage , and she said it has affected every area in her life			0
' your social security number is tied to every piece of information about you , ' she said			0
' so , yeah , it 's kind of daunting			0

@entity10 , 25 , went to local @entity7 office to prove she 's alive
she learned someone had filed her number as deceased in november 2014
@entity10 said the office implied ' everything 's taken care of ' and she was fine
but after three months her number has n't been reinstated , she has n't received her tax refund , and her driver 's license also lists her as deceased
and now she 's in jeopardy of *losing* her job as a licensed pharmacist
