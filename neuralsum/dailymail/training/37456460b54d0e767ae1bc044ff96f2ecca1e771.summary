with his dapper dress sense and lacerating wit , the @entity0 looks - and behaves - far younger than his 93 years			2
but in a rare show of frailty , the 93 - year - old royal stepped out in public wearing hearing aids for the very first time today			1
the listening devices , which could just about be seen protruding from his ears , were worn during a reception for members of the @entity15 and @entity14 at @entity16			1
for her part , the monarch , who is 88 years old , cheerfully chatted to veterans , among them corporal @entity32 of the @entity33 and corporal @entity34 of the @entity35 , as she toured the room			0
the reception was held on behalf of the @entity15 and @entity14 , which brings together living holders of the @entity39 and @entity40 , while remembering those who lost their lives			2
currently , there are 30 living holders of the two awards , both of which reward exceptional valour on the battlefield or in dangerous circumstances			0
the @entity15 is the oldest and most prestigious of the two and was instituted by @entity51 on 29th january 1856 for those who show ' most conspicuous bravery or some daring pre-eminent act of valour or self - sacrifice or extreme devotion to duty in the presence of the enemy '			0
although the @entity15 can only be awarded to members of the @entity61 and @entity62 , the @entity14 can be awarded to civilians as well			0
launched by @entity64 on the 24th september 1940 , it was initially intended to recognise the efforts of @entity66 attempting to deal with the @entity67 but was soon expanded to apply to members of the @entity27 who display ' gallant conduct in the face of the enemy '			0
along with corporal @entity32 and corporal @entity34 , those to meet the @entity18 and prince @entity0 included warrant officer @entity74 , also a @entity15 holder			1
warrant officer @entity74 , who was awarded the prize in 1969 for leading soldiers of the @entity79 to safety following an attack in @entity82 , said the annual event was more important than ever			0
' i think events like this have become more and more important with the strife that the world is in now , ' he explained			0
proud : the @entity18 was introduced to corporal @entity34 ( right ) who won his @entity15 in the @entity90 achievement : corporal @entity32 of the @entity94 special @entity93 was introduced to the queen ' they help to strengthen the bond between allies and recognise the great acts of bravery that happen , not just in the armed forces but by civilians too			2
' it gives a bit of a morale boost to know there are still @entity39 and @entity107 being handed out			0
' the annual @entity16 reception has been hosted by the @entity18 and @entity0 since the @entity14 began in 1956			1
other members of the royal family have also paid tribute to the veterans , among them prince @entity113 and prince @entity114			1
impressive : @entity116 @entity115 and his wife @entity117 chat to the @entity18 at the reception award : as well as @entity15 holder such as @entity121 ( centre ) , the @entity18 met gc holder @entity123 ( right ) yesterday saw the @entity124 host a second reception at @entity126 for award - holders , while his son will take part in the annual service of remembrance for @entity39 and @entity133 holders in @entity134 tomorrow			1
but it is the @entity18 and @entity0 who have the longest standing relationship with the @entity14 , which began when they were both new to the @entity61 throne			2
other @entity15 holders to meet with the @entity18 , who will visit @entity141 later this week , included @entity142 and @entity116 @entity115			1
tradition : the @entity18 has hosted a reception for @entity15 holders such as @entity142 ( second right ) since 1956 heroes : the @entity18 and @entity0 with @entity94 and @entity148 's @entity15 holders important work : the royals pose for a group photograph with all of the @entity39 and @entity14 heroes tribute : the @entity124 hosted @entity39 and @entity14 veterans at @entity126 yesterday meeting : like his mother , prince @entity113 was introduced to heroic veterans during the event			1

the @entity0 , 93 , has never publicly worn hearing aids before
despite the devices , he was on sprightly form as he met heroic @entity15 veterans
@entity18 hosts an annual reception at the @entity16 for @entity15 holders
prince @entity113 also paid tribute to veterans at @entity126 yesterday
