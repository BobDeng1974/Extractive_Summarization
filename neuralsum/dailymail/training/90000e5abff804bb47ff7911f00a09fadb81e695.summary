@entity0 believes it would ' definitely be a bigger miracle ' than @entity4 's epic 1999 @entity3 final triumph if @entity5 can avoid @entity7 relegation			1
@entity0 and @entity8 scored injury - time goals as @entity4 beat @entity10 2 - 1 in @entity11 on one of @entity15 football 's most famous nights			1
the current @entity5 manager now faces the task of trying to keep his team afloat			1
even then , they still need other results to work in their favour , but @entity0 has no intention of throwing in the towel			1
' if we stay up it would definitely be a bigger miracle than @entity11 in 1999 , ' he said			2
' that night it was possible , and in football anything is possible			2
so we need to give ourselves a chance in front of our fans against @entity32			1
' it takes belief , togetherness , a team that goes the extra mile , and a hero stepping forward and doing something magical			2
up against it : @entity5 are bottom of the @entity7 with two games remaining miracle : @entity61 famously scored the winner for @entity4 in 1999 as they came from behind in the final minutes ' it 's still possible , it 's still possible that we are out of the bottom three if we win this weekend			1
we have got to give ourselves something to play for in the last game by winning this game			2
' one of the key points is just imagine how this place ( @entity33 ) will be next weekend if we have got something to play for , when we have got something to play for			2
' let 's give ourselves a chance by beating @entity31 , because this place will be absolutely rocking if we are in with a chance			1
' @entity5 's woefully erratic form this season suggests a quickfire championship return is the likely outcome of a chaotic campaign on and off the pitch			1
and if the @entity84 do go down , it would be an experience @entity0 has only felt once before in football			1
' it was with my local team ( in @entity91 ) , ' he added			2
' i think i scored two thirds of our goals that season			0
it 's the only relegation i have had			0
' but you ca n't compare that			0
i was just playing for my local team			0
i never thought i would play football for anything else but enjoyment			0
' here , you can see how much it means for your players , your fans , for so many more than just yourself and your little town if you play in the second or third division back home			0
' here , you have got a much bigger responsibility , and that 's my job now			0
this is a fantastic club			0
we are going into this game to give ourselves a chance to stay up			0
' @entity5 will face a @entity31 side reeling from six successive league defeats , a sequence that has piled pressure on manager @entity120 and caused huge unrest among @entity123 supporters			1
pressure : @entity120 faces protests from fans this weekend but @entity0 defended the @entity31 boss threats : @entity0 sees the likes of @entity130 ( right ) and @entity131 ( left ) as dangers to @entity5 's survival chances ' when clubs lose games there is always going to be noise , but @entity120 is doing his job and he deserves to do so , and i am doing my job to the best of my ability , ' @entity0 said			1
' we know we can only control ourselves			0
i will let @entity120 deal with his problems , and i will control my issues			1
i am not one of those who talks too much about the opposition			2
' we need something special			0
we have to go there and defend well against the likes of ( @entity151 ) @entity130 , ( @entity152 ) @entity131 and ( @entity154 ) @entity153 , but we 've got to do to them what they do to us			0
' it is a difficult position we are in , but it is still possible if we go and win at @entity31			1
short term , it is going to be a big tall mountain to climb			0
we need to win both games , and we need to have some help			0
' @entity5 defender @entity163 , meanwhile , has requested a personal hearing with the @entity165 after being hit by an @entity165 misconduct charge			1
charged : @entity163 was sent off for this tug on @entity168 before being charged for an incident in the tunnel area @entity163 has been charged in relation to an alleged incident in or around the tunnel area following @entity5 's 4 - 0 defeat against @entity175 at the @entity176 last sunday			1
@entity178 defender @entity163 had earlier been sent off by referee @entity179 for a professional foul on @entity175 striker @entity168			0
he will miss the @entity31 game			1
' @entity163 would like to put his point across			0
he feels it is important he can do that , ' @entity0 added			2
' he just wants a chance to explain himself			0

@entity5 are bottom of the league , two points from *safety*
they travel to @entity31 *tomorrow* before *hosting* @entity32 on final day
@entity0 also backed opposition boss @entity120
