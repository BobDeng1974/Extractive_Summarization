@entity0 himself described them as the ' strangest animals ever discovered ' and was baffled as to how they could have evolved			0
now scientists have unraveled a 180 year old mystery of the evolutionary origins of @entity9 's hooved mammals that died out 10,000 years ago			1
the continents native ungulates - hooved animals - have baffled palaeontologists as they share traits with rodents , elephants and camels			1
the four - legged @entity17 , shown in the artists impression above , has baffled scientists since fossils of the species , which died out around 10,000 years ago , were found by @entity0 180 years ago but now by analysing the proteins preserved in fossilised bones , scientists have been able to show that the animals are more closely related to modern horses			1
the technique they used also promises to reveal new information about other long - extinct fossilised species			2
fossils of an ancient primate found in the @entity32 may be the first monkey to have traveled from @entity34 across the @entity35 to @entity9			2
the discovery suggest that monkeys first arrived in @entity9 nearly 10 million years earlier than previously thought			0
scientists believe the first primates traveled to @entity9 , which was once an isolated island before it joined to @entity40 three million years ago , from @entity34 on natural rafts that drifted across the @entity35			1
the two groups of primates then evolved separately to create distinct families of primates			0
however , evidence for when this epic journey occurred has been patchy and the oldest fossil of a monkey found in the @entity50 was 26 million years old found in @entity51			0
but now fossilised teeth , found on a riverbank in a remote part of the @entity32 in @entity55 , that have been dated at 36 million years old suggest the crossing from @entity34 may have occurred far earlier			0
a reconstruction of the 38 million year old @entity58 ( left ) found in @entity9 is shown above alongside a species it closely resembled - @entity61 , that lived in @entity62 39 milion years ago unlike @entity64 , proteins can be better preserved within fossilised remains			1
the scientists say it could allow them to look back in time 10 times farther than current techniques using ancient dna			1
dr @entity70 , a curator at the @entity72 's department of mammalogy and one of the authors of the study , said : ' fitting @entity9 ungulates to the mammalian family tree has always been a major challenge for palaeontologists , because anatomically they were these weird mosaics , exhibiting features found in a huge variety of quite unrelated species living all over the place ' this is what puzzled @entity0 and his collaborator @entity88 so much in the early 19th century			2
' with all of these conflicting signals , they could n’t say whether these ungulates were related to giant rodents , or elephants , or camels — or what have you			0
' the researchers , whose work is published in the journal nature , began their study by attempting to extract @entity64 from the fossilised bones of ungulate fossils found in @entity9			2
however , @entity64 breaks down quickly in the warm wet conditions found in tropical areas that cover much of @entity9			0
instead the researchers began to look at analysing the sequence of a structural protein called collagen that is found in all animal bones			2
@entity109 can survive more more than a million years in a range of conditions and is made up from amino acids			0
the sequence of these amino acids is ultimately determined by the dna code of the animal and so can be used to draw conclusions about the species origins			0
the researchers screened 48 fossils of @entity121 and @entity17 - the same species that @entity0 discovered the remains of in @entity124 and @entity125 180 years ago			1
dr @entity128 , a molecular evolutionary biologist at the @entity129 in @entity130 who led the research , said : ' although the bones of these animals had been studied for over 180 years , no clear picture of their origins had been reached			2
' the photograph above shows the skull of a @entity137 plantensis kept at the @entity129 in @entity130 @entity0 ( right ) was baffled by fossils of the @entity137 ( shown in the illustration on the right ) when he first discovered it and scientists have struggled ever since to work out where it sits in the evolutionary tree the modern technique , known as proteomics , allowed the researchers to show that the closest living relatives of these species were perissodactyls - the group that includes horses , rhinos and tapirs			1
this suggests the strange @entity9 animals migrated into the continent from @entity40 around 60 million years ago just after a mass extinction killed off many of the non-avian dinosaurs			1
the researchers now believe their technique could help to revolutionise palaeotological research by allowing scientists to reach far further back in time than they have been able to with dna analysis			1
@entity167 , the lead author of the study at the @entity169 and the @entity170 , said : ' by selecting only the very best preserved bone specimens and with various improvements in proteomic analysis , we were able to obtain roughly 90 percent of the collagen sequence for both species			0
' this opens the way for various other applications in paleontology and paleoanthropology , which we are currently exploring			0

researchers looked at 48 fossils of hooved animals from @entity9
the species - @entity137 plantensis and @entity17 - were first discovered by @entity189 and @entity125 180 years ago
palaeontologists have struggled to decide whether the strange looking animals were more closely related to rodents , camels or elephants
scientists developed new technique for analysing proteins in bones that can reveal links between animals that have been dead for millions of years
the technique can reach further back in time than ancient dna analysis
they found that the extinct @entity9 animals were related to horses
the new technique - called proteomics - could revolutionise palaeontology
