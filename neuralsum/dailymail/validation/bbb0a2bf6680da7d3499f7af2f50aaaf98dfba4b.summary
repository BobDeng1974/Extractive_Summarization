an unmanned @entity1 rocket blasted off from @entity2 on thursday with a quartet of @entity5 science satellites designed to map explosions triggered by criss - crossing magnetic fields around the @entity8			1
the 20 - story - tall rocket , built and launched by @entity11 , a partnership of @entity13 and @entity14 , lifted off from @entity15 at 10:44 p.m. edt ( 0244 gmt on friday )			0
perched atop the rocket were four identical satellites designed to fly in a pyramid formation high around @entity8			1
data from the four probes will be combined to produce three - dimensional maps of the process			0
magnetic reconnection , as the phenomenon is known , is commonplace throughout the universe , but poorly understood			2
magnetic fields are generated by planets , stars , galaxies , black holes and other celestial objects			0
when field lines snap apart and reconnect , charged particles are sent soaring into space at nearly the speed of light , roughly 186,000 miles per second			2
on the sun , magnetic reconnection unleashes solar flares , each as powerful as 1 million atomic bombs			2
such solar activity can trigger magnetic storms and aurora displays on @entity8			0
mission space : they will fly in pyramid formation to provide 3 - d views of magnetic reconnection on the smallest of scales new frontiers : magnetic reconnection is what happens when magnetic fields come together , break apart , then come together again , releasing vast energy @entity5 is spending about $ 1.1 billion on the project , known as @entity28 , or @entity74 , in an effort to understand how the energy is generated and released			1
the satellites will fly directly into reconnection zones 44,000 to 95,000 miles above @entity8 and map what happens when magnetic field lines realign			1
" the @entity74 mission will conduct a definitive experiment in space that will finally allow us to understand how magnetic reconnection works , " lead researcher @entity87 , from the @entity88 in @entity89 , @entity90 , told reporters at a pre-launch press conference			1
the research may have some practical spinoffs as well			0
efforts to harness nuclear fusion in laboratories have been stymied by magnetic reconnection , which causes temperatures to drop in the fusion chambers			2
it also may help forecasters predict dangerous solar storms , which can knock out power grids on @entity8 and disrupt radio , gps and satellite signals			1
the mission is designed to last two years			0
science : the process of magnetic reconnection drives the aurora , as well as potentially disruptive solar storms			0

@entity5 has launched four satellites in a $ 1.1 billion mission to study the high - speed *interactions* between @entity8 's magnetic field and the sun
magnetic discharges drive auroras and play havoc with satellite *navigation* , *communications* and power grids
the hard - to - study *mechanism* underlying space *weather* is known as magnetic reconnection
@entity1 rocket was carrying four satellites
when in space , all four will be arranged in a pyramid formation , flying within about 6 miles of one *anoter*
