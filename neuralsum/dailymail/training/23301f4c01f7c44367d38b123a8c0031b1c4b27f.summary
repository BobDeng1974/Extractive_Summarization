if this was a different era , @entity0 might be reaching for the hair dye , but it ’s not so easy to pull wool over the eyes when it comes to age and decline these days			1
not in the time of statistics			2
as a device they are overused , as vividly explained by @entity15 , the inimitable manager of @entity16 , who tends to say : ‘ statistics are like mini-skirts - they do n't reveal everything			1
’ but what they verify in this instance is the first - hand impressions of a sublime player on the slide			2
at 31 years old , the other numbers in this equation are not looking nearly as convincing as they once did			2
@entity0 has come in for some criticism following a drop in form for @entity29 this season @entity30 ( right ) jokes with his @entity29 team - mates in training at @entity33 on friday a struggling @entity30 gets a shellacking from the @entity37 supporters as he struggles to stamp his authority more than that , the statistics drawn from each of the 2012 - 13 , 13 - 14 and 14 - 15 seasons , hint broadly at decline across a range of significant indicators			1
a striker who seemed indispensable when reunited with @entity48 in the summer suddenly seems out of place and ineffective in @entity29 ’s frontline			2
with @entity51 back in training and apparently fit , how much longer will he hold down a place ? @entity30 's touch map against @entity37 beyond immediate selection decisions , how much longer will he be wanted at the club ? @entity57 are keen to welcome him to the slower realm of @entity59 next summer , when @entity60 will have a year remaining on his £ 250,000 - a - week contract and could go for £ 10m			1
with a £ 10m loyalty bonus also believed to exist in his contract , @entity29 will have extra incentive to sell a striker who only two seasons ago was the difference between success and failure in sir @entity72 ’s final campaign			2
it seems like a stark fall , but the statistic that showed he only touched the ball 13 times in the win over @entity37 is not alone in suggesting the effects of time and injuries on his game			1
the basic frontline numbers do only some of the damage , showing he has scored just three @entity89 goals in 11 games and has contributed no assists			2
last season those numbers were 12 and three and in 2012 - 13 he managed 26 and nine			1
as @entity95 goalkeeper @entity94 , a @entity96 team - mate , told @entity97 last season : ‘ i have never seen a player with such a versatile game			1
he is a complete team player – so much more than goals			0
’ that has rarely looked the case this season			0
but the numbers of greater concern show that over the past three seasons focus on the rate at which he produces			0
whereas in 2012 - 13 he scored every 120 minutes on average and a season later was managing one goal every 132 minutes , that rate has slipped to a strike every 307 minutes			1
@entity30 cuts a dejected figure on the @entity116 pitch as he manages just two touches in the first half @entity30 's form has been in rapid decline this season , as the forward moves further into his 30s @entity51 is back in training with @entity29 after consistent injury problems @entity126 could be sold in 2012 - 13 , that ratio of goals per minute was the fourth best in the division among players who scored 10 or more			1
in 2013 - 14 , he was fifth for the same criteria			0
this season , of players who have scored three or more , he ranks 37th out of 39 , with only @entity136 and @entity137 behind him			0
an assist used to come every 347 minutes under @entity72 and every 528 last season			0
there have been none in the @entity89 under @entity141			0
@entity48 has seen his side struggle in front of goal - despite scoring twice at @entity37 on saturday @entity30 ( right ) chats with his manager @entity141 during a training session at @entity33 on friday and having managed an average of 3.4 shots per game in 2012 - 13 and 2.61 last season , it is now down to 2.15			1
his shots on target have followed the same pattern , as have his touches , which went from an average of 47.5 per game in @entity72 ’s final season to 32.67 in this campaign			0
of the indicators studied , only @entity30 ’s shooting accuracy of 59 per cent this season is better now than it was in his first @entity29 season			0
it ’s a long way removed the influence @entity30 used to hold over this division			0
is it the end ? are such predictions premature ? the next few months will offer more detailed and anecdotal clues , but the numbers currently do n’t make pleasant reading			0

@entity29 trained on friday as they prepare for the visit of @entity178 to @entity179 on saturday			1

@entity0 has been in steady decline since move to @entity179
striker 's goals per minute ratio has almost *tripled* since first season
31 - year - old has attracted attention from slower paced @entity59
statistics show he only touched the ball 13 times in the win over @entity37
