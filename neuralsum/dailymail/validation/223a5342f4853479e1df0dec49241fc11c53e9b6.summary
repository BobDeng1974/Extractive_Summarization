gold standard : a pot of freshly brewed @entity2 from the @entity3 , @entity4 , which has been named the world 's finest cuppa when going in search of the world 's best cup of tea , you might think of heading to lowlands of @entity13 in @entity14 , or of taking a trip to the @entity16 and the mountains of @entity18			1
but the finest brew in the world is actually being grown by a @entity21 on a disused sheep farm in @entity4 , and has just been awarded the prestigious salon du @entity23 in @entity24			1
the fragrant leaf is so rare and so highly prized that grower @entity26 is selling it for £ 1,150 per lb - 200 times the usual price - making it the second most expensive in the world			1
in addition , most of his tea is being exported to @entity36 , a feat likened to selling coals to @entity38			1
the success comes as something of a surprise to mr @entity26 , who founded his @entity3 in 2011 with £ 140,000 and just three plants			1
mr @entity26 told @entity43 that he spent years on organic farms around the world , studying how best to grow crops in @entity4 's cold climate , and convinced himself he could do it			1
while he initially met with success , creating 2,000 cuttings from his original plants , disaster struck in 2012 when the coldest winter in 200 years all but killed his crop			1
he said that after the setback he and his wife were too embarrassed to tell anyone what they were doing , so kept their operation a secret			0
but on @entity64 last year the plants sprouted again , at which point mr @entity26 revealed his scheme , along with his first batches of @entity68 and @entity2			1
he sold his first tea at @entity70 by mail order , with most of it going abroad , and @entity73 and @entity74 have now started stocking the leaves at £ 30 for a 35g sachet , or roughly £ 10 per cup			1
@entity26 , who is from @entity78 , developed his tea plantation on an old sheep farm in @entity81 ( pictured ) using £ 140,000 and just three plants from which he managed to grow 2,000 cuttings and today the @entity2 variety was handed the top gong at @entity24 's prestigious tea awards , making it officially the best cuppa on the planet			1
mr @entity26 said : ‘ we started with a dream and pursued it			1
it ’s wonderful to have all our hard work recognised			0
' some said we were mad but my partners and i knew we could do it , and with two new daughters on the way i confidently expect my children and grandchildren to be producing tea			2
' we are in it for the long haul			0
’ the upmarket @entity103 at the @entity104 in @entity105 has also announced it will be serving the beverage as part of its afternoon tea range , priced at £ 10 per pot. executive chef @entity109 said : ' at the @entity104 , we are always looking to promote @entity4 produce to our international guests and local visitors alike			2
as well as being sold by mail order online , and at @entity116 in @entity117 , the award - winning brew can also be found at the @entity118 , @entity105 ( pictured ) , for £ 10 per pot ' i was extremely impressed with the flavours of the @entity123 white and smoked teas			2
it is even more impressive that the teas are able to grow in our climate			0
' as a nation of tea lovers , it is fantastic news that @entity133 has delivered such an impressive product to such a high standard			2
' many tea connoisseurs visit the @entity104 for our wide selection of loose leaf teas , and we are thrilled to be adding these two new local teas to our collection on an exclusive basis			2
' the tea taste test ... by @entity144 an urge to delicately raise one ’s pinkie in its honour is irresistible			2
the china cup perched on a delicate saucer somehow demands reverence			0
the tea it contains has , after all , been 5,000 years in the making – surely it is owed more respect than your average mug of @entity158			2
when the warm golden liquid , cooler than one might expect from a cuppa , is raised to the lips , does one notice the suggestion of smokey apple , or a hint of botanicals ? yes , there is definitely apple in its clean , fresh flavour			0
but as to the botanicals , i do n’t even know what they are			0
pinkies out : @entity144 detects a hint of smoky apple flavour and a hint of botanicals in the clean , fresh flavour of the award - winning @entity2 these terms are used by the visionary who has produced the first tea in the world to be grown in @entity4			1
@entity184 has created something very special , so special in fact that he is on course to sell it to the @entity36 – the tea retailing equivalent of sending coals to @entity38 and persuading the people of the @entity194 tribe to buy a refrigerator			1
sipping the tea , one can appreciate its appeal			2
it is unusually delicate and fine			0
suffice to say , it tastes lovely and one would be loath to gulp it down , grab one ’s bag and run off to the office			0
but as a lover of very strong black coffee and weak black @entity207 , it would take a palate more refined than mine to extol all of its virtues			0
mr @entity184 assures me , however , that experts who know about things , men whose tongues are insured for £ 1million , have informed him officially that he is making the best tea in the world			1
international orders are already flooding in for his white and white smoked teas , which are produced in the wilds of @entity81 by his @entity3 , based on the @entity123 estate near @entity221			0
the tea 's makers believe it benefits from altitude , clean mountain air and fresh spring water which is unique to @entity4 high - class @entity117 store @entity116 has already sold 230 kilos at £ 2,300 a kilo – or £ 30 for a convenient 35g sachet			1
working out at £ 10 a cup , it is the second most expensive tea in the world			1
and from today , in the sumptuous surroundings of the @entity103 in @entity105 ’s @entity118 , an iconic venue for afternoon tea , mr @entity184 ’s produce is , in another world first , now up for the public taste test			1
the prestigious hotel on @entity242 has secured exclusive rights to put the teas on their menu , a snip at £ 10 a pot – twice the usual cost of ordinary afternoon tea – with an accompaniment of the ‘ finest shortbread in the world ’			1
this is highly pleasing to a man who was once regarded as mad for sinking £ 140,000 into the dream of growing tea in the cold ‘ marginal ’ climate of @entity4 – and producing a drink of such distinction and quality that it costs 200 times more than the usual stuff			1
‘ the price reflects the rarity , ’ said the former chemist , a father - of - two whose wife , @entity262 , is expecting to deliver twin daughters before mothering sunday			0
his tea came first in the prestigious @entity269 awards in @entity24 , which was , he said , like receiving an accolade for making the finest of fine wine			1
he added : ‘ we started with a dream and pursued it			0
it ’s wonderful to have all our hard work recognised			0
some said we were mad but my partners and i knew we could do it , and with two new daughters on the way i confidently expect my children and grandchildren to be producing tea			0
we are in it for the long haul			0
’ mr @entity184 , 44 , has 14,000 plants growing at 700ft above sea level , more than enough to produce tea for the next 70 years			2
the @entity3 was originally the brainchild of his partner @entity291 , and they were joined by @entity292			0
the partners believe tea plants benefit from altitude , clean mountain air and the fresh spring water unique to @entity4			2
mr @entity184 said : ‘ i ’ve worked in five different continents researching how to grow organic foods in marginal climates			0
i knew we could grow crops in @entity4 , and we have			0
‘ the honour of being the most expensive tea in the world rests with a black @entity36 tea costing £ 4,000 a kilo			1
‘ bizarrely , it is not produced to drink but to be bought and sold as an investment			0
‘ our tea , while expensive , is very much made to sipped			0
’ i ’ll drink all the tea in @entity81 to that .			0

@entity26 started tea plantation in 2011 with £ 140,000 and three plants
entire crop was nearly killed a year later by *bitterly* cold winter *weather*
but last year produced first batch which is now being exported to @entity36
today it won @entity324 in @entity24 , making it the world 's best
