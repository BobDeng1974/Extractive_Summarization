for most of us , it would be flattering to be told we look years younger than our age			1
but one 50 - year - old found the compliment rapidly losing its appeal – as a supermarket told him he looked far too fresh - faced to be served alcohol			2
father - of - three @entity8 , whose eldest daughter is now 30 , had popped into @entity10 on his way home			1
as his groceries rolled through the checkout , the female cashier noticed a bottle of @entity18 ’s whisky and asked him for proof of identity to show he was old enough to buy the drink			1
father - of - three @entity8 was asked for @entity23 when he went into a supermarket to buy a bottle of whisky mr @entity8 initially thought she was joking , but soon changed his mind when she called her manager			1
the forklift truck driver , who lives in @entity31 , eventually managed to convince the store to let him leave with the whisky			0
he said : ‘ i ’m 50 and i can take this as a compliment but it has gone too far			0
i do n’t look 24			0
i ’ve got a daughter at 30 , a son at 28 and my youngest is 17			0
’ @entity10 's has a policy of challenging customers to prove they are over the age of 25 before they are allowed to buy alcohol ' @entity42 enough i ’m slim built , i ’m tallish and the way i dress is quite casual , a younger person ’s trend sort of thing , but that should n’t put me at the age of 24			1
' mr @entity8 , whose oldest child is 30 , thought the cashier was joking but when he told her his age she still was not convinced mr @entity8 , from @entity31 , @entity53 , said people normally guess he is 15 years younger than his real age			1
he said : ' my dad did n’t look his age and my mum died relatively young and out of my six siblings i am the oldest , but i ’ve been told i look the youngest			2
' once i went out and somebody asked my daughter if i was her boyfriend and she said " do n’t be silly - it ’s my dad "			2
' i ’ve been on holiday with my wife and other people have thought i was my wife ’s toyboy			2
' a @entity10 ’s spokesman said : ' we are required by law to police the sale of alcohol and take our responsibility very seriously			0
' as part of this , we have adopted @entity75 25 , a policy of asking for identification from anyone who does n’t look over the age of 25			0
' we hope mr @entity8 took the request as a compliment as he must look very young for his age			1
' while it is legal in the @entity85 for anyone over 18 to purchase alcohol many retailers follow the @entity75 protocol			0
@entity75 25 encourages anyone who is over 18 but looks under 25 to carry acceptable @entity23 when they want to buy alcohol			0
